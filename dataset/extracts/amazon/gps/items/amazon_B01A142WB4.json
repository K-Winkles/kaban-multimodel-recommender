You can get text alerts, emails, and/or notifications on your mobile device if one of your vehicles is speeding, moving during non-work hours, outside of their area, or in an area that is restricted / off limits.This device is not going to give you 100%, second by second placement of your trucks. Your vehicle may move two blocks before it registers movement & you may miss a notification that it left the geofence that you've made around your company parking lot.However, very easy to train up your fleet manager or other newbie on how to write custom alerts, add new vehicles, et cetera.Worth the investment to protect your equipment and your company's reputation!",

I removed it and put it back in the same car and it reported one one-way trip and stopped working for two more days. I put the device in yet another car and it never reported its movements. Then I contacted support, they re-established connection and told me to drive it around to see if it worked. I advised Brickhouse that if they didn't fix anything, I expected the same thing to happen again so what was the cause? They said weak cell signal. This seems very unlikely as the travel was in an urban setting in Saskatoon, Canada but, even if it was, the technology need to be capable of re-establishing tracking when cell signal improves. I think Brickhouse Security needs to take their product back to the lab and get it functioning more robustly in real life applications. Very disappointed in this product and the service response.",
