I purchased a reconditioned model and was happy with the product. Since I always leave it attached to my car I don't care if the battery has some degradation.My favorite upgrade is the ability to see incoming phone calls. I must admit the quality of the phone call is iffy, but then even the sound quality of cellphones pretty much sucks.Overall recommended",

I tested this GPS the same day that I received it from Amazon.Pros:>I like the size of the screen and I like how light weight it is.Cons:>After doing a test run on the streets around the city, I returned it because as you drive the arrow on the screen was not on the street but on the side of the streets as I traveled.>The navigation does not warn you of the next turn until you are less than .03 miles from the turn which is a problem if you are in heavy traffic.>Once I setup the GPS bluetooth feature with my car radio and phone, I realized that this was not a good idea. Once I received a phone call it came in over my car radio like normal and the GPS which was not good. Too many distractions with the GPS showing me the same thing as my phone and radio in the dash. Some people may like that feature so maybe not a negative.Overall if it did not have an issue with the arrow, locating my house and less than .03 notification to turn, I would have not returned it. Again my fault for trusting and buying a refurbished electronic device.",
