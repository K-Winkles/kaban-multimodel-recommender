                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t understand the positive reviews and how these people are using this device. This device is not finding addresses that I am putting in for known places, like a gas station or a hotel, of which I am trying to enter for a trip (and I wanted to use a GPS device and not my phone so I could use my phone to listen to podcasts and not eat up my battery running Google maps and podcasts, while plugged in at that)\u2026 This device could not find the address to a local medical clinic but it was able to find the hotel next-door to it. Huh? It could find my parents\u2019 address that\u2019s not too far from my home, and it could find my work address in the next city over. But I am typing out the address, just street name and number, of a hotel I want to stop at and it\u2019s coming up with no results. When I tap on the find address icon, it\u2019s only allowing me to type three letters, DOD, when I want to type out Dodge City, and it greys out the rest of the keyboard, and it takes me to a results page, and gives me only two cities, that are within my state, that start with the letters DOD\u2026. And the user manual or the product listing, says that this device comes with updated maps and that there is no need to update it, but when I go to the update maps website as listed in the user manual, and I click on the USA maps option, it takes me to an error screen. And the manual also says that there\u2019s contact information in the email sent upon order, but I just see emails for all the products that I have purchased and their order or delivery status, but there should be an easier way to find contact information for this seller, it should be in the manual\u2026. And my return window is expired, but I was waiting until closer to my trip to use this device, so I guess my fault for assuming it would work fine and not trying it out sooner, but now I\u2019m here with a device I can\u2019t use and I\u2019m out the 60 whatever dollars that I can\u2019t even get back now. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do with this device. I don\u2019t know how to make it work and I keep losing track of finding my way to get to the option to send message to seller through the product order. This is too difficult\u2026 and Amazon support have to a phone number to call to speak with support, but I don\u2019t want to get some surprise international calling charge on my bill.",
