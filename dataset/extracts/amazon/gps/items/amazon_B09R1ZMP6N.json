                "reviewText": "The product was ordered in January for our trucking business which started end of February. When we installed it and tried to use it , did not work properly as it should be. The screen switches on and takes long time to start. When you insert an address it loads and takes ages to come to the result : Address not found !! All addresses we inputted , all resulted to Not Found which is impossbile. All settings were done properly from our side. We ended up using google maps from the mobile phone which is not compattable for trucking routes. As well the screen started fading and freezing. The holder is very weak and keeps on moving resulting in obstruction while driving the truck. After all this hassle we are not able to refund it as the 30 days passed by already. Very disappointed as we didnt use this product at all. Waste of money and energy. Big NO.",

                "reviewText": "This product is as described and works as required. Few things of note and not deal breakers, the shroud when installed covers the red led power on light, you can however see that the screen is on, the same shroud on the left side the retainer covers the power on switch. easy fix the shroud has 4 retainers so i simply removed the one that covers the power switch. Additionally fingers dont work so well on the touch screen and is so noted in the instructions just use the supplied wand and it works perfectly. Instructions could be a little better but not difficult to follow through.Would buy again.",

Basically, upgrading an older car with hands free calling, GPS, etc. .It only had sound in the beginning, then it cut out and I haven't been able to get it back. Nothing in the device's controls will fix the problem since the device is fixed at highest to 40% volume. I've tried every sound linking setting on the device to try and fix this only to come up empty handed. Settings on the phone being tinkered with don't help either.There is a reset hole on the back but even when an object is inserted at the correct size ... nothing happens. The device did not come with a reset tool. I was trying both the backing to an earring and a nicely sized sewing needle.The company doesn't seem to have a website. I'm in just over 24 hours into the 48 hour wait for the seller to reply to me about trying to fix the sound issue.Not happy here.",

The product is not user friendly and it gives you the wrong information a lot of times plus it really does not like to allow you to completely put in the physical addresses it stops at 3 or 4 numbers and the address has 5 or 6 numbers plus refuses to allow lot or apartments numbers anywhere. I got this for work, I continue to use my cellphone for gps information. It is too much hassle to send back so I am keeping it and use sparingly.",
