                "reviewText": "I recently acquired the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2, and it has proven to be an exceptional addition to my tech arsenal. Here's a detailed breakdown of my experience:Ease of Setup: 5/5Setting up the SmartTag2 was a breeze. Within minutes, I had it seamlessly connected to my phone. The user-friendly setup process makes it an excellent choice for both tech-savvy users and beginners.Price: 5/5The pricing for this tracker is reasonable, especially considering the absence of monthly subscriptions that some other brands impose. It offers great value for those looking for an efficient tracking solution without breaking the bank.Smart Features: 5/5The SmartTag2's smart features are a game-changer. With three programmable buttons, I can easily locate my phone with a double tap. The other two buttons are customizable \u2013 I use one to control my smart lights, ensuring a well-lit home upon my arrival, and the other to send a quick message to my wife, notifying her that I'm on my way home.Sound: 3/5While the SmartTag2's sound feature is functional, it's not particularly loud. In crowded environments, it may pose challenges in locating the tracker. However, in more confined spaces like my home, it works decently when I misplace my keys.Reliability: 5/5So far, I've been extremely happy with the reliability of finding lost items using the SmartTag2. I use it on my keys, and I receive a notification when my phone gets too far from the tag. Remarkably, even when I go to get my mail from my mailbox, it regularly notifies my phone that the tag has left the area. Additionally, the tag can ring my phone when I misplace it.Overall Impression:The Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 has been a reliable and innovative companion. Its ease of setup, affordable pricing, and versatile smart features make it a top-notch choice for anyone seeking an efficient tracking solution without the hassle of monthly subscriptions.",

I don't have much to say on the battery life, but I'm pretty sure it will last a very long time. I like the form-factor compared to Tile. It's sleek and doesn't take up too much of your key chain.

                "reviewText": "Being honest, I was not expecting this much. It works really well in terms of locating it. The map takes me exactly where it is. Besides being compatible with Alexa and Smartthings, you can share it with your registered members through smarthings which can save you from a predictement in the future.I bought 4, 2 of them are meant to use with my kids. While they are not really design to keep track of people , since after 120m, it will switch from bluetooth to another technology I can't even remember how it is called, you can keep track of it with it regardless of the distance. Although there has to be a galaxy device nearby to be able to work properly when it is out of bluetooth range.My only bad comment, I guess, is the sound that is uses when you select \"Ring\" in smartthings. Since I have a hearing disability which prevents me from hearing sharp sounds, and the sound it uses is sharp as hell. So, I guess I wont be using that function lol",

                "reviewText": "Dear Samsung. I purchased this tracker based on several positive reviews and videos. It looked like you have a wonderful product that goes head-to-head with other popular trackers. Unfortunately, I did not read the fine print when purchasing this tracker. My fault completely! When I received the tracker and opened the SmartThings app on my Google Pixel 8 Pro, I was instantly informed that this tracker would not work with my phone and would only work with Samsung phones. OK, I think your phones are nice and feature packed. If possible, in the future, please extend this device to work with any Android phone capable of running the SmartThings app. If you can get this to work on most Android phones, you will crush the competition. Thank you.",

                "reviewText": "I have mixed emotions regarding this item. Some features are not working properly. Sometimes the GPS shows different addresses nearby or close by but not the exact location. It takes time to track the tag since people are not around to pinpoint the location. Find my phone feature doesn't work at all by pressing the button twice on the tags that I own and the NFC feature is not working either. The battery life is doing well and the process to set up the tag to your device is very simple. I enjoy the Smart Thing app is very easy to track items and using the camera to find the items is great. When you walk away and leave your item behind the app will notify you that you are far from the tag or your item. I enjoy this feature. I tested the tag by giving it to my friend and having him drive around this is how I was able to pinpoint his location or sometimes his nearby location. I am planning to test it when I go traveling and see if it works properly. Praying that all goes well if not I will return it.",

                "reviewText": "I attached this to my keys to ensure I dont lose them, however after leaving them on my keys for a while I have noticed an interference with my key fob, I have to be super close to my car just to lock and unlock it, ontop of this I dont really see the benefits of having this when it wont update the location, even with other samsung devices around. Which I find strange, and the tracker always beeps randomly and I can never find out why. Its super annoying. Especially when it suddenly starts beeping during important or sensitive meetings. Also sends alot of low battery warnings even though its a new battery and then it acts like its perfectly fine. Perhaps I got a defected one but. Im not sure.",
