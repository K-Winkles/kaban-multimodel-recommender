                "reviewText": "Doesn\u2019t work like it\u2019s suppose to. Freezes up. Mine has been stuck for 3 days now and I have reached out for help and no response. I have done the trouble shooting and still nothing. This was for an important use for my teen driver and it was a fail. Not happy with this at all. Money down the drain for sure.",

                "reviewText": "The unit last about 7 days on a full charge- Accuracy seems to be spot on. Purchased a 6 month service not overly expensive but not very cheap - But worth the price to know where my Vehicle is. The app downloaded easy and works as expected. I like being able to see the daily history of the GPS's travel. Only down side I have noticed is the battery life but I can live with charging once a week.",
