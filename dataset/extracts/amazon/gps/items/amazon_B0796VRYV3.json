                "reviewText": "Even though I\u2019ve rated this three stars in the initial three rating areas, my overall rating is four stars. Here\u2019s why.I\u2019ve been using a fairly old Garmin Nuvi six inch navigation device in my summer cars for several years, because they were not equipped with factory navigation. The Garmin beanbag base worked fairly well, except on this Chrysler Crossfire, which has a very firm suspension and is the type of car that begs to be driven hard. I\u2019ve put about a couple of hundred miles on the car since installing this base. The dashboard on this car is as slippery as ice; it\u2019s amazing how slippery it is. The beanbag base would slide off, hard, every time I turned or accelerated a tiny bit too fast. So it was useless on this car.The base under review is, so far, keeping the Garmin in place. However....I have not made any sudden turns, stops, or jack rabbit type starts. I\u2019ve been driving fairly conservatively, but there are a lot of rough roads around here, and driving usually includes a great deal of stop and go streets.I\u2019m almost certain the first time I decide to floor the gas pedal from a stop, the base and Garmin will fly off the dash. It\u2019s quite wobbly. There are very angles available, none of which are completely satisfactory. But I can live with the most perpendicular to the dash angle.So, I\u2019ve overall rated this base four stars, because it seemed like the best available option I could find. I refuse to stick anything to my windshield, mainly because the windshield is already quite small. I fully expect to have to resort to some other type of adhesive for this base, probably sooner rather than later.",

This new clam shell style holder is just great! It is solid. It holds the GPS firmly while allowing full access to the touch screen. And you can stick it where you want, up close so you can see it and use the touch screen as much as you need to. And you can position it so your copilot can interact with it too. I don't know why it took me so long to research and see that this thing was available. Awesome holder!",
