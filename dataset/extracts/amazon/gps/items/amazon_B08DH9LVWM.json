                "reviewText": "We have owned a couple of the Voice Caddie 200's, but find this well worth the purchase price. This new VC 4 has a much better satellite connection. We did not loose signal in the first several rounds while the VC 200 was constantly looking for the course. Battery life is 3X, good for 54 instead of 18 holes. Being able to get front, back and center distance to the pin was helpful and it has a nice feature of being able to measure the shot travel distance. We find that helpful when honing in iron distances. One minor issue for us was the belt clip. Nervous that it might not hold well, we added a short lanyard (like a wrist lanyard for a cell phone) and ran it through a belt loop. We found them dangling from that lanyard several times a round. We probably saved ourselves the search to find it. All in all very happy with this item!",

Had it attached to my hat on a windy day, my hat blew off and landed on the green and the VC4 stopped working. Called everyday for over a week to see if I could get it fixed and always got voice mail. Left messages at technical support, general mailbox, and even tried wholesale inquires and no one would call me back Thank you Amazon for taking the product back even if it cost me 20%.",

                "reviewText": "This is my second Voice Caddie and I was very interested in distances taking account of the slope. I really like my older model so I treated myself to the new SC4. I played several rounds using the device and it worked perfectly. After my 5th round I started to have issues with the device which included the button getting stuck when I depressed it so the voice kept repeating the distance annoying some of the golfers around me. Secondly I had a lot of trouble shutting off the device I had to keep holding the button to shut down the device and since the button is very small it was hard to it while wearing a glove. On several occasions I had to put the device into my bag because it kept repeating distance because of the stuck button. I tried to return my device to Amazon but the date for returning the item was missed by by 7 days to I had to contact Voice Caddie and request an RMA. I am hoping that they replace the device but I had to pay for the shipping and insurance. I returned the device on May 11th so I will see what happens.Followup: I reached out to voice caddie and they set me up for a RMA so I sent my device back VC4. After evaluation they sent me back a new device which I received on 05/25/2021. On Thursady of the same week I used my replaced device for the first time and it worked fine for the first 9 nine holes but on the back nine I started to have the same problem as my first device. The button would get stuck causing the distance to get repeated several times in a row. I lifted the back of the button to stop it from talking and again tried to press twice to get front and back distance but the button kept getting stuck. I contacted voice caddie via email and simply asked what can they do for me. I am awaiting response. I sent my email on 5/29/2021.",
