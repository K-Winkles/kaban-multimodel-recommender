The GPS does fit very tight in this so I took a Dremel to the upper clip so I can remove the GPS with one hand (ground it down till it was easy to remove). The suction cup works way better than the one that came with the Garmin (that one was getting old though). I've had it on the wind shield for several weeks and it hasn't budged.I bought 2 due to the bad reviews, but I'm glad I did as I can use the second one for travel and leave the other in the car.",

Had a few issues with it falling of the windsheild but I assumed I needed to remove it a clean the windshield and suction cup... until I went to relocate it. Basically I got it where I wanted it, made sure my GPS was functioning and was properly located, then today I went to permanently install it (i.e. hardwire the cable for the GPS) and found that the suction cup was ripped. Guess that explains why it was falling occasionally! Now it's completely useless... Shoulda saved my money and bought direct from Garmin I guess!",

The first time I used it I thought it was not going to work because it did not stick and fell to the floor. However, I picked it up and tried it again and it stuck and has been sticking ever since. It does dry out, just as the original did and falls off the windshield on hot days, but that is not a concern for me since I take the GPS off of it when I park it for the day or in a parking lot unattended. I do not want to advertise my GPS for everyone to see or take. I got two of them just in case I leave it again and will not have to be without. Awesome buy.",
