                "reviewText": "So far everything is working great (one issue noted below), I could wish for better Trip functionality from the tracking screen though (explained below). Also note, this device does everything all of the other ones do, you just have to \"upgrade\" your account for an additional annual fee for each extra feature you add. (Compared to the device my co-worker uses, it still comes out cheaper to use this product, even with the \"extra\" costs added!)As such, I highly recommend adding the GPS 1 minute updates, 3min updates is only good if you are tracking a vehicle that constantly travels on interstates only. once the vehicle gets in to a town area, it is possible to completely miss a stop.My issue with the Trip screen, and only real problem is that my car is a hybrid, and when the electric engine takes over for an extended timeframe it causes the tracker to think the car is turned off. this stops a trip and then starts a new \"trip\" once the electric engine turns back on. As for what constitutes \"an extended timeframe\" I \"believe\" this is anytime the car is in electric mode DURING a GPS pole. So if the car slips to electric, then hops back to gas before the GPS updates, it does not break the trip up. This problem occasionally causes my vehicle to show 15+ trips in a day (in the worst case, and 4 or 5 trips on the good end) when it was only driven to work and then home without stops.",

                "reviewText": "Just added this to my BMW to replace some of the functionality of BMW Assist. The critical functionality are location, road side assistance, and maintenance support, and remote door unlock. This device supports all but the door unlock (no devices support this for BMW yet). Review is on basically the functions I use.Setup: Very simple. Get account, enable device in account, get e-mail to confirm. You then plug the device into the OBD port, start the car, wait five minutes, check the function LEDs for indication of cell connect and GPS sync. VERY EASY.Tech Support. Unfortunately, the system was not updating my location on the first full trip I took. I submitted a ticket to Tech Support by e-mail. The response time was very rapid (less than one hour) and updates started.Based on a limited experience, below are my comments. These will be updated if my experience changes the results.Pros:a. Low cost solution with remote monitoring and no fee.b. Easy setup.c. Great tech support.d. Can get a more frequent location reporting for a rather minimal fee.Cons:a. The system generates a lot of alerts within the application. I would prefer being able to select the alerts I receive to reduce the clutter.b. No door lock/unlock capability for BMW (same is true for other products).",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE 11/22/18After contacting customer service 10 plus times and getting nowhere, I returned this unit to Amazon and will dispute any $30 activation fee with my credit card company.I purchased a \"Spectrum Smart\" unit and it works perfectly in both of my vehicles.UPDATE 11/9/18I am definitely returning. After being installed in 2 different vehicles (one being a 2018 Chevy), this unit has yet to work properly for an entire day. As of this very moment, the unit shows that I turned off my motor (at highway speed) and that the \"last known\" location is 40.8 miles away from my home.I have been updating the tech support numerous times only to be told that my 2018 Chevy \"OBD-II port has somewhat unusual voltage characteristics\"This does not explain why it also did not work in my child's 1999 Subaru.INITIAL REVIEW:Quite disappointed in this unit.Will likely return unit and fight to get my activation fee back from VYNCS.I followed printed directions step by step.Paid the $30 activation fee, etc.The vehicle was driven for 2 days and NEVER updated a single time.Power cycled as per instructions. After power on, vehicle showed \"not moving\" in my driveway. Drove vehicle again for 15 minutes (as per instructions). Unit NEVER updated.Tried the unit in another vehicle (2018 Chevy). Did NOT update location.Customer service does not have a phone number listed.You must \"login\" to your account and open a ticket.Support claims they will respond within 48 hours.",

My wife's Mazda 3 GT started having all sorts of electrical problems, parked or while driving.Also the GPS reading was horrible. Why would a parked car constantly be triggering zone entry and exit alerts?! And if you hope to get a diagnostics reading care of this device, you are not going to have much data to analyze.Although I had chosen to have the route shown on app and browser, I only showed GPS breadcrumbs (and horribly inaccurate).Anyways I had no choice but to opt for a return and reimbursement. Thanks to Amazon, not Vyncs!Hope Vyncs reimburses my $40 activation charge too (which was paid directly), as was guaranteed if the device is returned in 30 days.",
