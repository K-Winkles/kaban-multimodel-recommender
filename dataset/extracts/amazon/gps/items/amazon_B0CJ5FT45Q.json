                "reviewText": "Recently retired we are doing our best to try and do without the monthly cell phone bills. Switching to voip phones at home and track cell phone for away from home where we pay as we go by data purchases. The biggest problem we were having was now that we have retired, we want to travel more and therefor are using the GPS feature on our cell phones which uses quite a bit of our data. We had an older Garmin but were unable to update the maps, so we turned to Amazon for an answer. This seemed to be the answer and so far, it is working perfectly. Between listening to the local news station for traffic updates and the up-to-date maps this offers we have had zero issues Even after missing a turn this device gets us right back on route using the easiest and quickest reroutes. It is very simple so zero learning curve. No need to even read the instructions. We figured it out 5 minutes into our first road trip. A onetime purchase including lifetime updates for about the same cost of one month for our old cell phone plan this is perfect for us. Cell phones are such a high monthly expense and a must for some but not for all. If you are trying to dump the cell phone just like the cable, then this is something you will need if you plan to do any driving. It has already paid for itself, but I hope we get many years of use out of this device. Several of our friends have already followed our idea on this one.",
