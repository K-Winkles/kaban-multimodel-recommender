He takes $20 a month for GPS only. You can get any smartphone, with a prepaid provider for $25 a month and get internet voice, data, and text. The fact that they are just using a SIM card for GPS makes $20 per month steepVersus the competition: I have always used to Tracki and I think this is a similar price with the subscription and advice, with very similar accuracy, destiny different platform and interface. It also has better battery lifeThe prior version of Optimus is the best price for what you get, but the battery life is less and tracki he has more options. I simply looking for accuracy and price, not battery life, you don't this new version. However, has a one-time purchase I don't see why you wouldn't catch the one with the best battery life since tracking often poses a challenge when it comes to keeping it charged",

                "reviewText": "For$39 it works great, plus $19 a month for subscription. My only issue is the accuracy is not perfect. It can be off by a few hundred feet when sitting. Signal is obviously bouncing. However when moving on the street it seems pretty close to correct. I suggest the 10 second update when tracking a moving object/ person. This gives the best route history and actual cornering. Otherwise it cuts off the corners due to lack of updates. Overall I\u2019m very impressed. Comes with a nice weather proof magnetic case for attaching to a metal object (car). Battery life seems good so far. Mine has been on for a week and still shows 100%.",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s been on the car for 2 weeks and battery is at 68%, the magnet is strong and holds very well if you attach it to metal. I suspect those reviews that say it fell off because they didn\u2019t attach it correctly. The accuracy is a bit off because I get notice of movements like 5-10 mins after the car started the trip but I guess it\u2019s when it receives the gps signal depending on the area. Overall it\u2019s a great product for $30. I will buy another just to swap it out at the same time when I have charge it but for now it should last well over a month at this rate",
