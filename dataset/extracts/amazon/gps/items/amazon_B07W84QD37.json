                "reviewText": "This is a toy GPS. I'm sure someone could make this work but I question why. It has a nice sized screen but it is so hard to use that it's irrelevant. We tried and tried to get it to work but thankfully managed to return it just before the window closed. Here's one weird example and this is no joke. In a Settings sub-menu we found entry bars for \"Bra Size\" and \"Cup Size\". I'm not kidding and have no idea what that's about. We returned it and bought a Garmin Drive 52. It is a basic GPS that was instantly functional and made sense to program. The screen is smaller but it is plenty big and it actually fits in both our cars better. The Garmin has an easily detachable ball mount with many mounting options available, including aftermarket. The Ohrex uses a flimsy plastic clippy-thing that only works with the suction cup mount that comes with it, and does not work well with that. The Ohrex manual says that it will not work right unless it's on top of the dash. If it's in your hands or in front of the dash it may not pick up a signal. That's a large loss of visibility and the Garmin has no such difficulty. Save yourself a headache and buy something else. The Garmin was $34 more.",

When I contacted the seller I was directed to download an update that should correct the issue, More important - they have always responded quickly - 1 to no more than 3 days including weekends!This GPS seems to be as good as the \"Name Brand\" units friends have but for an amazing priceI've had this for a few weeks and traveled about 500 mi and (other than a few times it momentarily \"lost signal\") it has been doing well - especially when I missed a turn and had to take a \"scenic\" tour of Pittsburgh to get back on track without going under low bridges etc.Overall, I like this unit & love the price. I drive a 40' Class A motorhome and programmed my height, wgt. etc. and use RVTrip Wizard to plan my route. So far, this has been in line with the programs routingI like that I could program my maximum speed (62mph) and (like a mother in law in the back seat) it would tell me to slow down, this in addition to the normal monitoring of posted speed limits.Screen is large, informative but volume could be louder.We are on a multi state trip and will post again if any issues. So far we got all we expected and more!UPDATE - The more I use this, the more I get used to this, the better I like it. Feature rich and informative.",

I used it for a 1900 mile trip from Texas to Nebraska and back and it kept fussing at me for going over the speed limit when I was going the \"NEW\" speed limits.Also, when I stopped for gas, it asked the reason, and directed me to its proposed place. When I went elsewhere, it kept telling me to turn around and go back. Even when I was 100 more miles down the road! Lesson learned. Don't answer the question.Also, when I got to Interstate 80, it tried to tell me I was weight restricted...on I-80. WTF!Anyway, I am very pleased with my purchase. I like the large display and ease of mapping routes.",

                "reviewText": "We received this a few weeks ago and I was quite impressed with the graphics, the accuracy, and the speed of updates such as course corrections. Love that you can put in a vehicle type - we bought it to use with our motorhome. Gave it a good try over the weekend on trip just across the state line. To test is, I programed the Ohrex GPS, and my wife put in the destination on her i-phone Apple Maps. Initially the time of arrival was about 20 minutes different on a 2 hour drive. Apple maps had us getting there sooner. The routes were identical. As we drove the GPS arrival time adjusted by a couple of minutes to an earlier arrival time, but the Apple maps just kept adding time. Turns out that when we arrived, the Ohrex GPS initial prediction of arrival time was only a few minutes off, whereas Apple Maps was off by at least 20 minutes. I love that once you near your destination the GPS actually gives off the house numbers as you drive by. This is real bonus when it is so hard to actually read street addresses. Another feature I like is the automatic zoom in and zoom out. When on a limited access roadway, it zooms out to give the \"big picture\" view..... .only the information you need. As you near a destination, of turn off the highway on to local roads, the GPS automatically zooms in to give more detail, such as intersecting street names. This is a really good GPS, and at a really great price.",
