This allows me to store the GPS unit safely in the overhead compartment of the RV keeping from getting scratched or possibly losing my cords and adapter. The outer shell seems to be ridged enough to protect the unit. I should be able to carry the Tire Pressure Monitor in the case as well giving this case an added value for me.",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice large case for just about any type of equipment you might need to store. I use it for something other than the Garmin GPS device. It's built of quality materials and protects electronic equipment very well. It has a cushion flap in the middle that allows you to store cables and other accessories. The size of the case is compatible with many different types of electronics equipment and works well for long- or short-term storage. Great case!",
