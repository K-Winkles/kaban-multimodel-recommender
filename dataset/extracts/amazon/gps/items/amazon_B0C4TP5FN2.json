                "reviewText": "I got this mostly for the speaker on the magnet - and it has a great speaker with good quality and easy to connect to bluetooth on the iPhone. I downloaded the app and use it for the yardage display and that works well too - I have not used the app for my scores as it is much harder to navigate than the current app I am using - but that is not why I got it. Good speaker, good yardage front middle and back - and a strong magnet - its not falling off the golf cart!",
