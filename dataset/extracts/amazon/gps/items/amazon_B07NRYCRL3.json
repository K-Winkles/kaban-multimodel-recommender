                "reviewText": "I highly recommend this product. It is well made, comfortable, and best of all, performs essentially perfectly. I happened to play yesterday at a course that had a lot of yardage markers on sprinkler heads, and I took several opportunities to stand on those spots, and the reading was exact on my device. Also, I find that the GPS system is much easier than having to carry around and then pull out your scope and stand up like a pirate trying to get a buzz on the flag. With this, you just walk up to your ball and look at your wrist as if telling the time. (Note: I guess on some holes an optical rangefinder theoretically could measure a few feet closer than the GPS, because the latter measures \"front, middle, back.\" If you are a good enough golfer to need your measurement within inches, maybe consider that, at up to 5x the price. I'm not that person, ha.) Side notes would be that the set-up with the app is easy, and downloads of course updates are speedy. On-course use is easy and intuitive, and switching back from hazard distances to green distance is easy. This product is outstanding, and the reasonable price is a bonus. Finally, on the box, the vendor says they are committed to your satisfaction, and give you a phone number and email for any questions.",

                "reviewText": "This is a well made, accurate yardage watch at an affordable price. I have used it twice on two different courses in Florida, and compared it to another gps yardage device, and the readings were always within 1 - 2 yards of each in distance to the front, middle, and back of a green. It also reads distance to hazards, especially useful when attempting a shot over water. BUT one huge negative: EXTREMELY difficult to correctly hook up the charging cable to the watch contacts! Came back from course yesterday and fiddled with it for 15 minutes before finally giving up for the night. Other device I have connects instantly and shows it's charging properly. This Tec Tec Tec certainly could have used a better charging system. Also, it does not hold a charge very long, even when only using it as a watch. After an initial full charge, I noticed battery was almost fully discharged in 48 hours, when it wasn't used for golf. So on your wrist, for golf, it's an inexpensive, relatively well made, yardage device. Charging it is a pain.UPDATE: 2/25/21 After getting a full charge into the watch on 02/24, battery was totally drained this morning! It was not used for golf. It was last used for golf yardage on 02/23, then fully charged yesterday. I think the battery is defective, and I returned it today, rather than request a replacement. Too bad because it was accurate and easy to operate and fit my wrist. But I had to return it.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this product 4 or 5 months ago. The first few times I used it, it was great. Yardage was accurate. It is easy to read. Instructions on use OK. Then....all of a sudden the yardage readings were totally off. A 137 yard hole read 669! I wrote to the company, not once, not twice, but at least 3 times. Each time it was suggested that I reboot or manually input a course etc. Each time I struggled to do what I was supposed to do, not even sure I was doing the right thing. Then it would work again--once. Next time out on the course the yardage would be totally inaccurate. It was very aggravating. All of a sudden \"the light bulb went off in my head\" and I noticed that the real issue appeared to be that there were times when the hole number was incorrect. No wonder when I went to the back nine it made no sense! Anyway, I now check each hole number and advance it or go back and reenter the hole number until I get to the correct one. I am not saying that this is a good thing. My friend has a Golf Buddy that always calculates the hole she is on. All I am saying is that if you purchased this watch and are getting strange readings on a hole, check the hole number displayed and adjust as required. Doing this little thing can save you a whole lot of time. Rebooting and manual entry of courses is time consuming. I wish checking the hole number was a suggestion from tech support. I would have liked this product a lot more if I realized that there was a simple solution to a big problem.",

The distances have proven correct based on the results shown by \"other products\" owned by my fellow golfers. The watch presentation is easily read. The short-form labels of \"hazards' will take some \"getting-used-to\"; that's to be expected. One fellow golfer was impressed by the fact that the course updating feature was cost-free - indicating that other GPS-based products allowed limited updating without incurring additional charges. So overall, it appears that the watch is a good purchase for my needs.",
