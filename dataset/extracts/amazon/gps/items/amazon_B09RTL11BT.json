I wanted an air tag holder that would conceal and be comfortable to wear\u2026 this product fits that bill and more. Initially, I sought wristband air tag holders but realized that it would be easily removed by my child (or someone else). This pins into a garment and does not irritate or bother my child at all. Highly recommend for parks, field trips, etc.",
