                "reviewText": "I can do my own stereo, speaker and amp installations. I can R and R a transmission but not rebuild a transmission. So I'm plenty qualified to install this even though I'm not an ASE certified tech.Take a picture of the ID on your device! Activate your full size SIM card before inserting in the GPS!Once you get through the install process the unit works well. The description recommended the 'SpeedTalk' SIM card so that's the one I purchased. $5 a month so cheaper than the phone app and you can't turn off this GPS whereas you can turn it off on the phone.The instructions are clear enough. I was confused about the APN. The instructions say \"please check with your SIM card provider if you don't know it\". That's incorrect. The APN is the example APN that is shown in the instructions in step 6. I sent the short APN message. After that I sent the middle-length APN message in step 7. I did not send the optional APN message with the user ID and password at the end of step 6.Once I did this I logged into their website and nothing (initially)... Shows some location in California which I'm guessing is their HQ. I then looked at the instructions and in the Function section I did #4 to get a google link, no link was sent back. I then did item #1 in function to set control number. Again, the website doesn't work. So I put the app on my iPhone and it works great! Now it's day 3 and I tried the website again and it works fine and it is much easier to view than the app.The app is rated poorly. The app is 4 years old. The app works though. It is clunky and takes a minute to get used to. Don't be put off by the rating. They *should* update the app a little just to get better reviews if nothing else. Severalcomplaints were about 2G service which is no longer around and people were setting it up while 2G was going away. Now this device is 4G and everything I found says 4G will be here for another decade (until 2033) or more.I am using this on a golf cart and I wanted to keep it modular so I could easily move it to another vehicle if need be. To do that I connected the power (red) and accessory (orange) together to 12v positive. I connected the black to negative. I cut the end of the yellow so it couldn't make contact and I did not install the relay. It's another point of failure and so I wanted to avoid that in case I made a bad connection. I zip tied this to the cart frame. The only physical install issue I had was when I pulled the GPS apart to put in the full size SIM the wires unfold that are inside and it takes a little bit to get them all back in. I also dropped one of the screws which took some time to find so don't do this part in the driveway like I did, put the activated SIM in the GPS while at the kitchen table.The replay function defaults to the current day, but you can click on it and pick any begin/end date/time. The speed shown on the reply is accurate enough. My golf cart is limited to about 20.5 mph. On the first trip it showed a top speed of 33kph which is exactly 20.5mph but I know I was doing 20 for longer than the app showed. On the second trip it showed 35kph which is a little faster than I went but still pretty close. Also, I have been unable to figure out how to switch to MPH.If I need to switch this device to another vehicle I just pull off the two spade terminals and mount it in the next vehicle. Because I didn't use the cutoff relay it's as simple as using a zip tie to mount it and connecting the + and -. If you use the relay it will be harder to move.I'm paying $12.99 a month now for an app that tracks stuff, but now I'm going to cancel that and just pay the $5 a month SIM card. I'm very happy with this purchase even though the activation took 30 minutes for the SIM activation and the GPS activation/configuration. Physical install took less than 10 minutes.Absolutely recommended.",

                "reviewText": "I have 1 on both my bikes. I had there older model 3G but do to no more 3g cell phone tower in the USA they no longer worked. I bought this 5g one and it works great. This model now includes that not in the description they actually include the relay. Under this GPS tracker there is an option to turn off the fuel pump or you could wire it to your ignition coil. But the older models never came with a relay or whatever you needed to actually make that work. It was an actual surprise when I opened up the box for this one and it actually included to the relay to actually make that option work. So if you wired it to your fuel pump or your ignition coil if someone stole the bike or car you could actually kill either or and the bike or car with no longer run. I tested the wire that would go to a relay because there is actually no instructions on how to wire this relay to the GPS unit. When I tested the GPS tracker wire when you activate or deactivate it it only sends out if I remember correctly .5 Volts to one volt. So I am guessing that you would actually tie that to the ground on the relay. .5 to 1 V would not be enough to actually operate a 12 V relay to activate it. So I think they are activating it through a ground system. So the relay would have constant power and once you activated the ground it would activate the relay.I\u2019m giving it five stars due to I did not expect to get the free relay that I actually need to use that option / Feature in the GPS tracker. I am torn by maybe should I give it four stars because there\u2019s no instructions on how to wire this relay to the tracker. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

App gives me more functionality than the webpage. Easier for me to send SMS commands to device phone number to program. Many app buttons are incompatible for my device. Got Geofence and sms alarm to cell programmed. That\u2019s enough for now.I emailed SinoTrack with a question. No reply in 4 days. So I can\u2019t rate the customer service at this time. They sent a reply after 6 days.Question: how to add additional gps trackers in the app?Question: how to recover a lost password on another ST-901? One was installed in the used car I bought. Dealership said it wasn\u2019t theirs. So now it\u2019s mine I guess. :)I like this unit so far after one week. Putting into my trailer since my friend got his rig stolen. A little piece of mind.",

I have installed over 100 of this GPS units for my customers without a problem. Occasionally one is defective but that is uncommon.I alsoi want to let the seller know that A few days ago I placed an order for 12 pcs ST901 GPS. After I received them I had 2 pcs that did not work. My intention was to return 2 pcs for replacement but by mistake I marked all 12 pcs for replacement. So I am returning 12 pcs but only 2 pcs are bad and the other 10pcs are good. I am sorry for the confusion. Please accept my apologies. Thx for your understanding and have a great day.",
