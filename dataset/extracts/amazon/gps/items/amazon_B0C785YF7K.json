The main difference is that HEVC (H.265) allows for further reduced file size. H.264 (AVC) can be chosen for compatibility with older desktop and mobile devices. We recommend VLC Media Player on PC to play videos. How to use parking monitoring function? Do I have to buy a separate hardwire kit? Yes, parking monitoring function require the hardwire kit and protect the car battery from depleting. Hardwire kit is not included, you need to buy it separately (Asin: B0BNPWTSBH). Is normal for my dash cam to get hot? OMBAR 570 allow withstand extreme temperatures from -4\u00b0F to 158\u00b0F(-20\u00b0-70\u00b0), the normal working temperature is about 30\u2103 to 50\u2103, so it is normal for your dash camera to run slightly hot, especially in 4K recording. What should I pay attention to when using it for the first time? Pls tear off all protective film before using the dash cam for the first time. You MUST formate the SD card before the first-time use. Pls ALWAYS connect with power when using as it is built in Super Capacitor(without battery).",

Installation was tedious as expected for any front & rear dash cam, but I was pleased to see the product came with a tool which made it much easier to tuck in and hide wires. Easy to install. Small and unobtrusive - not an issue at all after installing it on the windshield below my mirror. Immediately connects to my phone every time I start my car.
