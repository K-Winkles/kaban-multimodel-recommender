I used round velcro pads to attach it which were the perfect size - CHENGU 12 Pairs Referee Patch Hook and Loop Dots 3 Inch Self Sticky Circle Hook and Loop Round Adhesive Loop Tape Double Sided Hook and Loop Fasteners. I first cleaned the spot on the dash with 91% rubbing alcohol, let it dry, applied the pad to the dash and pressed for 2 mins. The next day, even in 58 degree weather it was stuck on extremely well. Then I pulled off the protective layer (just the big one, not the red one too) on the clamshell unit and stuck the other side of the velcro to it, holding, pressing for two minutes and I was good to go. It's really nice to use the velcro so you can plug in your GPS, put it in the holder and then put it on your dash. Plus you can readjust it any time you want. So far I love this thing, it's very well made and light but heavy enough to let you know it's good quality.",

Otherwise, the adhesion was good, but it simply isn't good for any kind of off road use.",
