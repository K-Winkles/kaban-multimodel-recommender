My antenna install located the unit just under my dash (thin top plastic cover), directly over the dash climate control vents. The proximity over the vents allows me to warm the unit up quickly. I cannot comment on how long it might take to warm up without the assistance of the heater vents close by.",

The sides of the connector (along either side of the moving latch) need to be shaved down some, about 0.020\". These are the square edges, not the rounded ones. (If looking at the face of the connector, it is shaped like a U, trim the tops of the U) Do not trim the latch. Otherwise it's perfect and fixed my GPS (2010 Highlander Limited/Nav).",
