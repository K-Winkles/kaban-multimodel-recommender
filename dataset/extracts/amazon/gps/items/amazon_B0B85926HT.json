                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars GPS works well, responsive screen, setup can be slightly tricky depending on location",
                "reviewText": "This GPS works pretty well but there is some initial setup required in order to get it to work properly. The setup is a bit confusing when you turn it on as you do need to setup the region you are in. It will not detect it and setup for you unless you are on the west coast unfortunately. That being said if you are OUTSIDE the US, it can be used in Canada at least. One thing to note is the keyboard is pretty much setup in alphabetical order rather than in that standard keyboard style. It is pretty much the same setup as if you were typing in a location. It also looks to mimic the old apple keyboard. Again you need to make sure the device is in the correct zone or it will not pick up your location. That is where the confusing part I found when I was trying to use it at first. It does have a stand but I do not really recommend putting it on your dash. It does work on your dash but with these type of stands, it will damage your dash overtime so put it on your windshield if possible to avoid future damage to your dash. It does have that universal clip so I actually found you could use certain cellphone holders to clip to this if you have space to clip it to your vent or CD player holder. There is a screen cover on the GPS when it arrives and you can choose to leave it on or take it off. It does not hinder the touchscreen but it can look awkward. For the most part, this GPS does have free update and you will need to contact customer support to do so. I have not found any kind of way to do this via the internet which can be a bit of a bummer but they will help you get your device updated in no time. They also are great if you need help with the initial setup if needed. In terms of accuracy, it is fairly on point. There is actually a points of interests as well if you want to set that up but I found it easier to just use it only for gas station on long trips. The voice is clear and easy to hear. You can adjust the volume and brightness accordingly. You also get dark mode which will help you if you are driving at night and want less brightness. The device is fairly light so it should not weight down the holder or anything. It does come with a car charger and USB cable. It uses USB mini B cable which is a bit old and just another cable I need to have in my car which I am not too happy about that. I wish it would use at least a micro USB cable or type c. It does have a built in battery so you can turn your engine off and still have it running for a good amount of time. It will automatically go into sleep mode when it is not in motion for long period of time. There is no real lag on the software that I can tell and it does have 8 gb memory on it. You can add more but I do not see a real need to. You can do this via micro SD card (NOT SD). The directions are pretty accurate but it does not have traffic reporting so it will not give you the fastest route based on traffic. It will auto update the direction as needed which is great. When I powered it on and finish the setup, most of the addresses were up to date so I did not need to update anything really. The device does get warm but does not get extra hot even when in the sun. The suction holds pretty well but again I recommend on the window instead of the dash. The gps can be removed from the mount easily so you can put it away as needed. The operating system is fairly easy to use and does not require too much to learn which is great. Overall this is a good GPS to have if you want to have your own on board GPS system. It picks up signal fairly quickly and does not lag when you are operating it. I do wish the setup was a bit easier and less confusing. The responsiveness is good and it is well built. I also wish it had a more updated plug rather than the old USB mini B.",

It is missing some of the very new addresses and complexes that were just built but that always comes with upgrades. I'm sure eventually it will be there. Meanwhile when I drove to Naples I loved it. You are able to put in to avoid specific highways. Thats a great feature. Google maps does NOT allow it so that was a good feature. It also has music, different voice features, and other settings that make it easy to navigate and get to where you're going. It's a good size screen too so easy to see and read street names if you need to. I would recommend this to free up your phone, especially on long trips.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Cheap device for basic GPS navigation functions...",
                "reviewText": "When the suction cup mount for my TomTom would no longer stick to the windshield, I found this unit for little more than the cost of the replacement mount for my TomTom (universal replacements don't work). My wife has a Garmin, so I'm no novice to GPS navigators and had expectations based on those years of experiences. I've used this device for a couple weeks now and here are my initial impressions...PRO- It's cheap. My expectations were probably too high based on my other experiences. But it is cheap.- It provides most basic functions reasonably well.- The way the unit attaches to its windshield mount is loose and prone to falling off if you bump it right. That has happened to me once so far while driving, and reattaching it blindly is hit and miss or requires undivided attention. I just lay it on the dash until I could stop and concentrate on getting the pieces aligned.- The 2D display looks fairly good. It operates \"heading up\" (the top of the display is the direction you're headed). It does a reasonably good job of displaying street names.- At the top of the display is your heading direction, with the house numbers on either side of the road shown to the left and right of the heading. This is nice if you're looking for an address to know when you're approaching it. I haven't seen this in other units.CON- The user interface is confusing. There are two levels of menus - one that comes up when you first power it up but can be only accessed from the map display by hitting what appears to the the power-off icon. The connection between the two is strange. For example, the date/time function from the initial menu does not carry over to the navigation display, which effectively makes it useless. Access to other important functions is not intuitive, at least for me who's used to accessing them on the units I've been using.- Related to this is the obscure way to set the time on the navigation display, which is important in getting the unit to change from day to night display and displaying the ETA (estimated time of arrival) when navigating to a destination. Hint: it's in the \"regional settings\" option where the only useful choice is to use local time zones. BTW, the only mention of this in the instructions is in the frequently asked questions section. Why isn't this the default?- The provided instruction sheet is nearly useless. First, the print is nearly microscopic. Then it only explains the obvious options. When any less obvious function needs explanation, it isn't there. As I mentioned above, the only instructions for setting the time on the navigation display were in a FAQ.- It doesn't have a true 3D display as on TomTom and Garmin. The misleading image of a 3D display with the product listing cannot be generated by this device. (Seems a \"truth in advertising\" violation.) However, the \"heading up\" orientation on the 2D display somewhat overcomes the lack of a 3D display.- It doesn't have a display showing which lane you need to be in when approaching an intersection with multiple lane choices. A very useful feature when traveling the interstate highways.- It has a very annoying \"you are exceeding the speed limit\" audio alert if you go 1 mph over the limit, and repeats it from time to time if you remain above the speed limit. The only way to silence it is to turn off all audio assistance. Nobody drives below the speed limit 100% of the time. If you do, you'll be run off the road. Turning off all audio assistance, such as announcing approaching turns, makes the function useless.- If you are not following a route, expanding the time display at the bottom right nicely expands to display your speed and the speed limit. I use this because it is clearer and more accurate than the speedometer on my '99 Honda CRV. But if you are on a route to a destination, the time, speed & speed limit are replaced by the ETA, and time and distance to the destination. Then there is no way to display the time, speed, & speed limit. Other makers find ways to display both.- I only have had this device for a short time, so I haven't tried to update the map yet. But the instructions seem to agree with other comments that this is not straightforward. I'll miss my TomTom for this feature. All I have to do is drive within WiFi range at home and it automatically connects to find updates and allow me to kick one off as I leave the car.In summary, this device is no TomTom or Garmin. But if you're cash strapped, it has enough essential functions to at least be useful in finding local addresses and finding travel routes to your distant destination.",
