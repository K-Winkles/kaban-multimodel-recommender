                "reviewText": "I knew nothing about these devices so I did my best to research. I tried this one, and I am glad I did! Using the device is super simple; charge it and locate it in whatever vessel you are seeking to have tracking access of. The app on your computer or phone is basically a map, and it shows you date, time, and movement of the device. You can determine yourself how often you want the device to send you location details, and obviously the more reports you have the device send, the shorter the battery life. But even having it send reports the max of every 10 seconds, for me, the battery still lasts 6 or 7 weeks! Customer service at this place is super responsive and helpful with any assistance, a great product and company overall.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this product and one other to track my child who is visiting her mother who is currently in Texas for the holidays. We are currently in a custody case for our child who currently lives with me (the mother lives in Mexico). In an effort to insure that my child does not leave the country but still has the opportunity to see her mother, I am using this product to track my child's whereabouts using GPS location, GeoFencing, and email alerts for various situations. I placed this product in a pocket in her backpack, another similar product in the lining of her suitcase, and further a third (software) on her phone. I figured between the three at a minimum one would make it through any attempted abduction and give me ample opportunity to alert the authorities at the border.So first, the purchase, delivery and setup of the GL300W was very easy. I did the setup online and the purchasing of the plan was smooth. The device activated within about 10 min and was showing location in my home. I also setup the competing device and the cell phone at the same time. Similar experiences with those as well. I needed to run a trial prior to my child leaving for Christmas break with the other parent. So, I setup a geofence around my home and around the school property and set the distance of the fence at 0.1 mile. I put the unit in the school backpack. I setup the alerts that I wanted to receive in email for the events I needed. The trial lasted about 8 days. I was pleasantly surprised that I knew when my daughter left home and arrived at school in addition to seeing the exact route that was taken to school and then back home in the afternoon. This allowed me to verify on a daily basis that my daughter was where she was supposed to be when she was supposed to be there.I had a problem with the competing product at the beginning in that when my daughter returned home from school it was showing that it was still at school. This product (GL300W) worked flawlessly and did not have this glitch. The 8 day trial was successful.My child left for Christmas and the unit tracked perfectly from our home to the airport. It lost connection during the flight due to no cell service at altitude, but picked up signal again when it landed in Texas. It has now been a full two weeks and it has tracked without fail with approximately 30% battery life remaining. My daughter is due back tomorrow so I will see how it tracks back home from Texas. I emailed customer service about the ability to track into Mexico and was assured that the product will work internationally. Customer service has been awesome so far and very responsive getting back with me within a few hours. Their pricing is very reasonable for what I was looking for, there is no long term contract required, and I cannot put a cost on the safety of my child and my peace of mind relative to that goal.The product does what it says that it will do and does it well from what I see so far. I was skeptical initially, but those doubts have passed. This product is reliable. All transactions and tracking is done via a web browser. If I had one recommendation for improvement it would be to have a user friendly app for Android or IOS. I am fairly computer literate so I was able to figure out what I did not understand. There are also videos on Youtube which can help you out with questions.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased two different GPS's to compare, this one and Tracki. I ended up keeping the AmericaLOC because of its performance but I really wanted to like the Tracki because of the more modern web and app interfaces. Just its performance wasn't up to par compared to AmericaLOC. I used both for a month before I decided to keep AmericaLOC.My Use- I put the tracker in my son's book bag to see when his bus leaves/arrives at school. And when he is returning from school so I can time the bus drop off. Several times this year our bus has been 10 - 20 min early, and 15 - 20 late.PROs- Pricing was cheaper- I could get 10 second updates- Very accurate and would update fairly quick once the GPS started moving (Tracki was taking 20 min at times to initially update).- size was comparable to Tracki with extended battery pack and AmericaLOC picture with the coins accurately gives a size estimate.- Battery life is great. I get 2 to 3 weeks with my use, updates set at 10 seconds.- GPS seems to be solid, well made. It doesn't feel like it will fall apart.- Unlimited texts. I have it set up to receive a text when my son's bus leaves the school, and another when he enters our subdivision. Tracki you only get 30 texts per month unless you pay for more.CONs- The cell app and web interface seem like it was developed in the 1990's. I am not sure who uses boarders around their icons anymore, but they do.SUMMARYIf you can get past the ugliness of the web interface and phone app, this GPS seems to be perfect for what I use it for.",

They are simple to use and provide accurate location information using GPS and by providing cell tower based locations when the device is buried under other luggage or is indoors.

The Americaloc technical staff are extremely helpful if you are having trouble getting location information, they are quick to respond and provide very helpful information. The trackers can operate for over a week with one charge and they provide information on location and speed when they are moving.",
