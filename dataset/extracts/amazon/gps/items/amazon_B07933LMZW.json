With 3G going away I had to replace my tracker and purchased this sim card to use in the new device. But, truth be told, I never put it into service. My old sim card from a couple years ago still works perfectly and was a straight transfer from one device to another and we are still operating as we always have.These guys are easy to work with and are quite helpful when you need them. The price options are many with the lowest being $5 a month, plus they have had some offers that gave me free time. They may still have them and will step right up and advise you that you have time coming. (Not sure if they still have this but it has been my experience over the years.) I set mine up with an automatic pay using a gift card to limit my exposier. Then after seeing that they were very honest and did not make billing errors I placed them on my regular card and forget the bill. It is charged to my card every month and I do not have to be concerned. (Just my trust in them. You may differ.)Bottom line is the sim card works, the service works and they have multiple options and will help advise you as to what will work best for your needs. I was surprised, back then, when they told me that my best option was their least expensive. Expected to be over sold but was not. We love these guys service. Which, by the way, has never had a single glitch.",

When we activated it, it prompted to make another paymet of same amount as we had paid on Amazon. it said it was prepaid but it was not true, since we had to pay again to be able to use it while they advertised it was prepaid ready to use. it doesnt have a monthly contract but it does, or it will get cancelled. I called to refill it and customer service said it was cancelled. That i had to buy again and activate again. So it is a scam.... the good thing it is that makes the kids watch work amazingly. Very disapointed that they were jot able to activate the sim card even when ready to pay w cc. They were cold and didnt care if i needed it or not. Tried to send me to.walgreens or walmart to see if they carried it there which they didnt. Disapointed formthe service.",

This simm costs me $3 per month and allows me to track my car should someone take it. It also is motion activated, so should someone walk into your car, it sends you a message.",
