Buy the c320, a 4 or 8GB Mini SDHC card, and find MioPocket online.I don't think the MioMaps are all that bad really. I live in an area where we don't get high priority on such things. (We just got Google Streetview 6 months ago!) Can't attest to the battery life, as I haven't left in unplugged all that long. Only about 2 hours total, and it still 'showed' ~1/2 power.Only real criticism is it is a little big and bulky. Not smooth and shiny like the new devices out there. But hey, it's a 4.3\" screen.",

                "reviewText": "The product is my first GPS, so I am a bit biased. However, I have to mention couple things that are good and several that are bad. First of all, it is a nice unit, attaches well in the car, and one should not have much problem running it. However, the one I bought did not do what it was supposed to do. It would not power up. I had to be creative and give it jump start otherwise it would finished as a refurb. I had no time to hassle with postal and stuff so I did the tech job myself. When it finally made to be used in the car, it would make me crazy: it woudl announce the important changes to late. So I would miss the ramp and then had to listen about \"route recalculation\". Or it would simply ignore important details at the complicated junctions so it would skip the fact I had to reach another lane and make turn... The \"route recalculation\" is also poorly written algorithm as it would always take me some weird routes, even when it was attempted to be tweaked in the route options. Then also it would miss on the house numbers and I would end up at the wrong side of the street. All in all, I am happy to have some help in the car, but it is unreliable and I can use it mostly to locate current position on the map. When it comes to managing direction (that is what GPS are suppose to do) this unit is a poor choice. I am considering selling this one and buying another brand.",
