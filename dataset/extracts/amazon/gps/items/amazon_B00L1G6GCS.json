With the tracker safely contained in the sealed case, its electronic components are protected. Within the case a GL300 tracker could be placed under a vehicle, and the tracker will continue to operate even if the vehicle becomes submerged during a flood or caught in a sandstorm. Because the case is made from an industrial-strength, high-grade plastic, incoming and outgoing signals are not blocked as they might be in a metallic case. Essential Insurance that Works for You The Weatherproof Magnetic Case may not seem necessary when conditions are normal, but weather is fickle. If the GL300 Mini Portable Real-Time GPS Tracker is riding shotgun on a vehicle, any number of conditions could be encountered during a trip. If you've invested in a GPS tracker, the one-time cost of a protective case like the M2 is trivial. Magnetic Attachment Thanks to a pair of powerful, built-in magnets, the entire case attaches securely to the flat, metallic surface of whatever you want to track. You could affix the case to the bottom of a safe or strongbox. It could be placed under the hood of a car, truck or bus. It could be fastened to the top of construction equipment or to the side of a mobile broadcast studio. When you're ready to transfer the tracker elsewhere, you'll be able to remove the case without damaging or altering the surface of the vehicle or asset where it was initially attached.",

I never once had an issue with this unit staying in place exactly where I left it, even after weeks of use, lots of highway miles, and in all kinds of weather. Construction is very sturdy and durable, magnets hold extremely well, it never let so much as a drop of water through and onto the unit inside it, still small enough to fit into pretty tight places so it does not stick out, never once had an issue with the case blocking the signal to or from the unit inside it and the magnets do not cause any kind of interference either. It does make a pretty loud and distinct noise when installing onto a vehicle since the magnets really are so strong. Makes installation and access a breeze and it can be done very quickly. I have no complaints and have been using it for almost 6 months now, it is well worth the price purely for convenience and piece of mind.",

                "reviewText": "The case works great but it doesn't work with the gps tracker that Amazon said it would when frequently bought together. No i'm sorry but i don't fit in this box but that's alright because I used the heavy duty powerful magnets and using a little epoxy i mounted those onto my GPS tracker. Just be careful because im sure this will void the warranty but I didn't have time to order a replacement so I made something work. put it this way. the car it was attached to got hit by a train track inspecting truck on the same side it was mounted on and it never came off . When i went to retrieve it at first i couldn't tell where it was supposed to be with all the metal twisted up. But right in front of my eyes is where I should have been looking because that's where the tracker with the powerful magnets attached to them ended up.Still a great box to store things in and it doesn't take up a lot of space. Thanks kenny",

The case has a double latch and has two very very strong magnets on it, so if you placed this underneath or inside on a steel or metal surface it should hold in place very well. I turned the GPS unit on and put it in the magnetic case and I placed this unit inside the cab underneath the dash and stuck it to a spot where there was metal that would be up and under the passenger side foot well dash area and it stuck on their really well.",

The circular magnetic mounts do not inspire confidence but the case actually does work very well as long as you can find enough actual bare metal for a proper flush mount. I would recommend the case 100% but if you are not in the USA I would avoid the tracker until they make the 30Ma functional north of the border and hopefully work out the ongoing issues. (My understanding is that in the USA the tracker works very well - but we have only used it north of the border).",
