Base on the past experience, it's good design, very easy to use & navigate, the color scheme is pleasant. Unlike the older model, this one pick up the signal as soon as it's turned on. I use it for a long trip, and out of cellular coverage without worrying to drain my cell phone. My wife use it regularly since it comes with handy, convenient easy to adjust for viewing angle mounting hardware.Update 8/25/17: After 1 and 1/2 years, my wife has been using it regularly. This is a refurb unit, however there is no issue at all, especially with the battery. It's still running strong. Note that the pre-installed map only covers 49 US states. Check your map and update to cover your travel area.8/17 Updates: Over a year and half, we use it regulary - the battery is still running strong",

                "reviewText": "A pretty darn good system. It can be more time consuming to enter coordinates with this that other interfaces (you must hit spaces between streets: \"willow -space- glen\" or whatever, instead of entering \"willowglen\" and getting results).I do not recommend buying is product without lifetime map updates. That used to be a problem with older gps units, and I believe the cost for an update if you don't have lifetime maps is close to the price of a new unit with coverage.I recommend using an inverter with a longer usb cord - mine has an on/off switch so I don't kill my battery if I leave the car for a while. I tucked the wires in trim for a cleaner look and so I don't have wires getting in the way everywhere.",

This unit replaces the unit in my wife's car that stopped charging due to a broken receptacle where the power cord attaches. The design allows the mini USB plug to create stress on the circuit board and it eventually failed. This unit is of the same design and will also fail in a matter of time. My older unit has a plug that locks into the receptacle. Bad job, Garmin! Other that that, it works well.",

Now comes the nightmare of attempting a warranty repair or replacement. Save yourself some heartache, and spend the extra $50 or so dollars to buy a new device.**Update** I went through the process of trying to get this fixed through the warranty that Garmin supposedly has for this device. The bottom line is, I still have a GPS unit that does not work. This device quit working just weeks after receiving it, and I cannot get Garmin to repair it under warranty. This was the 7th GPS device I purchased through Garmin, and it is my last. I will never do business with Garmin again. I ended up buying a Magellan unit that has worked flawlessly. Garmin, your greed, and poor customer service cost you a long time customer. Thank you Magellan for all that you have done for me, you have a customer for life.",

I thought there was something wrong. After I got in a darker room and could just make out the display. I got the brightness turned up and then all was OK. Works as good as the Garmin that it was replacing. I do kind of like the split screen function it goes into when there are multiple lane options.",
