Another added bonus is the battery is supposed to last 30 days ( haven\u2019t had it that long yet but will update as time goes on). It also comes with a free 30 day trial before you have to pay a cheap subscription fee. Highly recommend for tracking your car or some kind of magnetic valuable if you are worried about it being stolen.",

The only thing I was not a fan of was the setup process. I wound up having to reach out to the customer support team just to access my GPS tracker. The app could also be redesigned to be more user friendly as well. But in the end, the performance is worth the headache to setup.",

                "reviewText": "The ABLEGRID GPS Tracker works very well for me. I\u2019ve read other reviews that said the device will go to sleep and not wake up, or is unreliable. I have not had this issue. I do know that there are settings you can change to tell the GPS device how often you want it to update. If you have it set to update its position not often enough your trip may look like a straight line on the map. If you set the GPS to update every so many seconds, it will show your trip accurately on a map. The GPS wakes up upon movement of what ever you are tracking. This is good since the device is battery powered and this will conserve battery. I used the device\u2019s magnet to mount it in my car. I mainly want to use it as a way to track my vehicle if stolen. It is also very useful to see where your car has been when my kids borrow my car. You can set zones on the map and have the GPS notify you your car leaves or enters the zone. The GPS can be accessed using the free IOS or Android software or by the website on your pc. I have included 3 example images of what you can see using the app or website.Example Image #1This shows my entire route I took today along with arrows showing the direction I was traveling. This can be accessed under the history tab. You can choose a maximum of 3 days history.Example Image #2This image shows my current location and battery level of the device.Example Image #3Example #3 is a report you can access through the app or the web site. It displays route length, duration, top speed (great to see what the kids are doing), etc. You can see on the report my top speed was 66.49 which was on a highway with a speed limit of 65mph. I was just a hair over the speed limit!Overall, a great GPS, good battery life, great software and smart phone app, and you get 30 days of free service to try it out.",

                "reviewText": "This is an amazing real time tracking device with professional software app for detailed information and pin point accuracy. The setup was pretty simple around 10mins or so and you're ready to go, that being said there are lots of settings and options within app that stand above your standard air tag. I've been using on vehicle for well over a week and data/battery life have been very good and should go easily another couple weeks without charge. However sometime within the week the magnet base has broke free from tracking unit leaving less options for placement but can easily be re attached via glue. I have not had to pay for any services but there are plans ect after 1st month from what I can see and rates seem reasonable. These would be perfect for fleets of vehicles businesses or recreational personal. I would recommend, easy and accurate.",
