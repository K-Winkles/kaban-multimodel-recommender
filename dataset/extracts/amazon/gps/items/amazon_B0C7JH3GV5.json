                "reviewText": "First.. comes with USB A to USB Micro charging cable. Charge it up before first use.I've tried to give some pictures with it out in very bright sunlight. Sorry, too cold right now to get an actual usage on the golf course.First off. It takes a few mins to find the satellites and pull up the courses the first time, so please fire it up while outdoors early. Seemed to come up faster on later 'power ons'.It's got a few different display options, but the default I like the best.Display 1: Center (largest number), front and backDisplay 2: Displays center yardage and you hit 'ok' to see the other two.Has both portrait and landscape modes for each display.Has a very nice magnet on the back, pretty strong. I've yet to see how well it handles bouncing on a golf cart yet - will report back after I take it for a spin and some bounces.Has a scorecard option you can turn on. You have to turn it on in the settings.Also, a nice feature is that you can hit the 'ok' button to see how far you hit it. Btw, have to turn this on in the settings too.It does have distances to hazards.So once you click on Play Golf. It's going to sort the courses from closest to furthest away. And for some reason, the font size on the display will not show the full course name. Would have been nice to shrink or let me shrink to see more. Then click on an option to get more details on the course - but it does not have this. So you'll end up seeing two of the same line but that's for the 1st and 2nd course. You won't know which one until you get to the course and trust the top option to be the course you're about to do. Not knocking this, but just a different experience I'm used to with my Garmin.Overall, I really like the concept since it's got such a large display to help out your cart mate vs. the smaller clip on your belt option. So if you play on older courses that the golf cart does not have this yardage features built in, definitely consider this as an option. And the courses are already in there.",

                "reviewText": "I've utilized Golfbuddy smaller than expected golf GPS's previously and albeit truly reduced, they are difficult to peruse and track down courses. This Izzo is obviously two times the size however it's still generally little and lightweight. I can't as effectively stuff it in my pocket however the magnet makes a difference. I can take advantage of the truck or I could get one of those attractive golf pack cuts. I like how the screen pivots albeit vertical feels significantly improved in the hand and is typically the way that I'm seeing it. Battery duration is all that could possibly be needed for an end of the week outing. I've attempted to give a few pictures with it out in exceptionally brilliant daylight. Apologies, too chilly right now to get a genuine utilization on the fairway. However, i truly do wish it had some additional usefulness at the cost they're requesting it. The sticker cost contends with a portion of the major, notable units out there, and they have additional capabilities like a guide of the opening and a more hearty scorecard that can be traded to different frameworks. While this has a scoring usefulness, it must be turned on, and it's restricted in nature. The GPS is yardage just, with no course includes, however there aren't any expenses so that is an or more.",

                "reviewText": "On one hand I like the simplicity of this GPS unit, it displays yardage accurately but doesn't really offer much more than that so I feel it is over-priced for this reason. Also I don't see any way to update the database if you wanted to add more courses in the future. Compared to some free phone apps that I've used in the past, this doesn't really offer much in my opinion. With that being said, if all you want is just basic information that is easy to read, then this might be perfect for you. Just be aware that it charges via an outdated micro USB plug (which is included) so be sure to keep it in your bag for when needed.",

                "reviewText": "First the good, the Swami Max GPS unit from IZZO feels high quality, and functions well as a GPS unit. I have had the pleasure of owning several Izzo golf accessories and all of them feel well made and get put to use on the course for me. This is no exception. The display is bright enough that I can see it on the cart on a sunny day, and the magnetic on the back firms sticks to the cart rails even over bumps and dips. The GPS seems accurate, and had all of the courses I play already mapped.I do wish it had some extra functionality for the price they're asking for it though. The price point competes with some of the major, well known units out there, and they have extra functions like a map of the hole and a more robust scorecard that can be exported to other systems. While this does have a scoring functionality, it has to be turned on, and it's limited in nature. The GPS is yardage only, with no course features, but there aren't any fees so that's a plus.Overall I'm happy with this, the large display is great for double checking distances from several feet away, but be sure to know what you're getting with this. Oh and it is micro-usb. At this point going into 2024, I feel like usb-c should be the standard.",
