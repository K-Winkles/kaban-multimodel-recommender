Additionally I contacted support about a question, and they were top notch. 5 stars all around.Because the material is smooth-ish so if stuck to a very smooth surface it can slide around if there is movement. You can use the double sided 3M tape they provide but that somewhat defeats the purpose of wanting something magnetic and moveable. Solutions I used: (1) Used a rough sanding paper to scuff up the magnetic side a little - holds without a problem now. (2) Used a sticky tack circle to ensure it doesn't move at all, but not permanent.",

The Klearlook Waterproof Magnetic AirTag Holder is one such product that has been extremely useful to me.With its strong magnet and waterproof design, I can easily attach it to any of my vehicles. Moreover, the double glue stickies provided with the holder enable me to use it on non-metallic surfaces as well. This product is a reliable and durable solution for keeping track of my expensive belongings. I would highly recommend it to others.\"",

If someone is buying this plans to take it backpacking cross country,\u2026they would need to watch this gasket while sealing the AirTag initially as well. I plan to check the seal and the gasket 2 times per year\u2026.after a harsh winter with temperatures at negative 5-15F and after the harsh summer with temperatures above 105 F.
