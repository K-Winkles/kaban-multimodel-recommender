Geofence zones are virtual barriers that can be used to set up an alert that will trigger every time your vehicle enters or leaves the area. You can set up a geofence zone around your house or your workplace. Geo zone alert will instantly notify you with a push notification, SMS or email. Geo-fence zones can act as an early warning system in case of emergencies and help businesses to record time spent on and off work sites. FLEET MANAGEMENT SYSTEM GPS live tracking software provides users with extensive information about their vehicles, such as; real-time location and address of the vehicle, previous route history for up to 1 year, alerts & notifications, geo-fence zones, business mileage logging, dashboards and reports. Vehicle tracking systems can be tailored to fit Motorcycles, cars, vans and lorries. Whether you have 10 or 1000 vehicles, GPSLive can become an irreplaceable tool and allow individuals and fleet managers to make the necessary adjustments to improve their fleet operations and profitability. REAL-TIME VEHICLE TRACKING The primary role of GPS trackers is to provide real-time geolocation of tracked vehicles and objects. Vehicle trackers allow you to locate your vehicles and mobile assets quickly on the map. You will be able to monitor the movements of your vehicles in real-time while they are en route for a delivery or check on your family members when they are driving through town. With the ability to locate a vehicle on-demand, managers and family members can send help in matters of emergency depending on the severity of the situation.",

                "reviewText": "The reason I did not award 5 stars to this product is because the software is a little clunky to set up, but once you have it going it's easy to look and see where your vehicle is on a map. It seems like it was designed for more of a fleet, rather than a household, but I guess that's beside the point as it still works for my purposes. I have a classic car stored somewhere that is secure, but of course it's always subject to theft, so I feel confident with the GPS tracker hidden inside of it, ready to alert me of any movement. It actually has relieved some stress from my life as something I don't have to continue to worry about. It's built tough, strong magnets let me hide it easily where I wanted to. Will update if the battery performance lets me down, or the car is stolen without a movement alert haha.",
