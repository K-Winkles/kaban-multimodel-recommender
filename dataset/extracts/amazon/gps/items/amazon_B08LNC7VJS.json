                "reviewText": "It took me a while to find this. My GPS is older, but, so is the car that I'm driving right now, so it doesn't have bluetooth, or anything. I have an FM transmitter, it turns the whole system into a Bluetooth system, I can talk to anybody through the car, perfectly, I can listen to music,, I needed it something that I can plug in as a USB, not the original car charger cord that comes with my Garmin gps. I still use a regular gps, and then I still use my phone as well. My Garmin tells me how fast I'm going and what the actual speed limit is, when it changes, each time etc, A lot of times speed traps are right where the speed limit sign is, so I like to have up on my window, my speed, and the speed that I'm supposed to be going. I have a little bit of a leadfoot, I need to update my garmin, if I were going to use it as my primary gps. I'm not going to, so I'm not going to update it, but it's still gets me where I need to go. The thing that it doesn't do, is factor in traffic speed traps things like that. So, I use my phone, as my actual gps, but I still put that one up there as a secondary, for both reasons, one it helps me get places, it's still good with the maps, and two, like I said, it tells me both speeds clearly. Anyway, I needed another charging cord, that would work, that had a USB ending, and I believe it's a micro USB that goes into the garmin, and this works perfectly, to charge, and my GPS still functions and picks up the maps as it can it's 567 years old, I'm not sure, so it definitely works for both things needed. Most chords are going to be only for charging, or only for data transfer. It's very difficult to find one that you can plug into your usb, I have to plug it into my USB because my the USB ending of the charging cord, goes right into my new oxy X10 FM transmitter, which is already plugged into my cigarette lighter, can't do a dual cigarette lighter thing with the FM transmitter, so I needed something with a USB ending, this was a great price, works perfectly, I believe the company even suggested it. Hope that helps, thank you very much, very easy product, something that I needed very badly!",

Needless to say, the original cable made the GPS unusable after two hours in the car as it would charge up.I'm a happy camper now. With this cable, it all works perfectly in the car. When I need to synch to the computer I'll switch back to the old one.",

My Garmin GPS is no longer in PC Mode and will turn on and function they way it is supposed to. However, the gps I have has traffic. The gps on its own without the original power cable will not give you traffic conditions. Traffic only works when it is plugged in. With this bgi usb-1 cable, there is still no traffic or construction alerts. The FM receiver might be in the garmin power cord, not on the gps itself. Still recommend this product though.",
