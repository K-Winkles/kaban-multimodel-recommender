                "reviewText": "I bought the device and during the weekend I purchased Birdseye maps since I was leaving early Monday morning. First off, I bought the map Saturday morning and was told it would take 24-48 hours for me to get the download e-mail. This was disappointing and it didn't make sense to me and there was no weekend support with which to contact. I kept checking online the rest of Saturday and most of Sunday and it said the order was pending. I finally checked my Spam folder Sunday night and it showed I received the order either late Saturday or Sunday morning (can't remember) but was disappointed the online status kept showing pending.I finally downloaded Birdseye but when I went to send the map to the device I kept getting an error that my device didn't have the prescription. I'm pretty computer proficient and tried various ways but kept getting locked. I tried calling Garmin from the airport Monday morning and they apologized but was unable to load the maps remotely. I'm back home and just tried to load the map again and it's still not loading. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to call sometime during the week to get this loaded.I'm rating the device a 3 because I was able to use it for some of the options but not fully.",
