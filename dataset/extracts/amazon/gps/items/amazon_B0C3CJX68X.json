We loved it and had no issues with it. The screen is big, the voice is clear, it starts to warn you plenty of time before your turn or exit is coming up, and it picks up where we left off if we exited out of the MAP or turned it off. You do have to keep it plugged in for charging most of the time but that is not an issue for me. Overall so far it's a great purchase for the price.",

I've owned several TomToms, all I had to do was plug it in, turn it on and the screen came up, everything was visually intuitive and the touch screen worked. This thing comes with a booklet of instruction in 3-point type that needs a magnifying glass, so you have to jump through hoops to get the screen up. And the touch screen options, like volume control, don't work on the one I got. I'm returning it. Also no instructions for mounting, only option was a suction mount for the windshield, nothing for dash - and it seemed a couple of mounting parts were missing. Sounded like a good value worth trying, but I'll try the more expensive and reliable ones like TomTom or Garmin .",

I've had a Tom Tom and a Garmin unit in the past and this one is superior over both. The bad reviews I read about this device are easily resolved in settings. My only complaint is that you have to periodically tighten the elbows in the over built mount. Hopefully it last longer than my Garmin which didn't even make it a year.",

                "reviewText": "My husband suffered a stroke three weeks ago. This forced me to have to drive to strange cities in order to get him to his appointments with various doctors and specialists. I never had a good sense of direction, which is why I never drove much. I always depended on my husband to take me places. When the stroke hit, this forced me to be the driver. This GPS device is a life saver for me. I don't know what I would do without it. Now, if I hear that my husband has to go to such and such a place, I am no longer afraid to drive him because the GPS device will tell me exactly where to go. I was always afraid to drive because of my lousy sense of direction. If there was a detour in the road, I would panic. This device took the fear away from me completely and has liberated me from my self-imposed prison. Not only this, but I am able to get my husband to the places he needs to go. I will never be without this device ever again.",

Charged the gps before traveling and entered my first destination. Tried to plug in the outlet it was to large and did not fit. When I plugged in the usb it moving as if it was charging and would not let me use it. When unplugged from the car it would not let me put in a street address. It would not highlight the v. Thank God for the GPS on my I-Phone.",

                "reviewText": "Nice heft and feel. I like the size and the screen is bright and I like the animation. It seems like a high quality product. The problem is twofold. First the GPS seems to be about 100 feet off. I often pull up to the street that I am going to turn onto and the voice says to turn in 100 feet, although I am right at the turn. Secondly, there are problems with the sound. About half the time the radio station is mute and then will break in with 10-15 seconds of sound and go mute again. Sometimes it never turns on. The sound of the GPS device is rather muffled and not clear and crisp like the radio and also it is much lower than the normal radio sound, so if I want to be able to hear the GPS instructions I have to set the sound of the radio at an uncomfortably high level. Occasionally the GPS does not issue any instructions regarding a turn. I chatted with the service dept. who was very friendly but the advice given did not help. I just went past the Amazon return time of 30 days, but I intend to contact the seller as they say they have a 90 day return policy so ultimately I believe I will have to return this.",
