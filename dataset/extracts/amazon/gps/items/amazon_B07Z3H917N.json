I live near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and traffic is becoming very difficult with delays a constant problem due to accidents. This Garmin has not been able to locate any traffic receivers so is pretty much useless for that purpose. I contacted Garmin and was told that the traffic function can only become active in large cities and there are only two cities in South and North Carolina that the traffic feature will work in and that it will not work in my area. I have not seen any statement concerning geographic limitations on any Garmin product. A good Garmin product otherwise.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this renewed Garmin drive 52 LMT after my previous one was stolen.Although it is a refurbished device at a lower price it works perfectly well as good as a new one.If you have any doubts about its quality you can add a protection warranty for a minimal extra fee for 3 years.What I really do not like is its battery life which is even shorter than 1 hour therefore we have always need to keep under charge connected to car adaptor when driving unless you may use it outdoors.Overall it is a good bargain for this price while a new same model will cost at least 70$ higher. Time will tell if I may regret it but the previous Garmin Nuvi 2589 worked well over 3 years which was also a refurbished device without any problems at all I suggest all buyers of new devices renewed or not to fully charge their Garmin at home with a powerfull wall adaptor (at least 2A output) before first use other vice the device won't turn on.Garmin ships them with almost a depleted battery as a safety measure .I was almost going to return it until I searched on Garmin web site that it will fail to turn on with an empty battery even it is connected to a low power charger/computer.",

No fancy add ons but was easy to program and worked accurately. The reason I\u2019m giving a 3/5 is because the list for the GPS said \u201c New\u201d and the box that the unit came in had \u201c Refurbished \u201c stamped all over it. Overall, it met my needs.",
