                "reviewText": "4 stars because 5 would be perfect. NO NAVIGATION INSTRUMENT is 100% perfect 100% of the time.I have used this for a couple weeks walking and driving around town and hiking in The White Mountain National Forest. It DOES A GOOD JOB FOR THE MONEY!NEED TO KNOW. My unit would not work until updates were installed. The Open Source map is a GLOBAL (the entire planet) shaded relief map. That is a colossal amount of data. Plan on adding a micro SD card for extra memory, connecting to a computer and allowing LOTS of time for updates before using. After updating you may choose only the map regions you need to save memory. I like having the whole planet! Also, there is NO \"lock safety\" for the toggle and buttons. Be careful not to have them pressed while carrying the unit in a pouch or case.A little about me. I have been hiking/camping for over 50 years and never been \"lost\" for more than a short time (99.9% who say they never get disoriented occasionally either never goes out or lies). I could always get back to a known point in a reasonable time with map/compass, with both or only one (paper maps & magnetic compasses can be off too!). I do know how to get around in the woods. I do NOT backpack without paper map & magnetic compass.I have been using a handheld GPS for several years. They are good tools when properly used (always with paper map & magnetic compass). This Etrex 22x replaces my Garmin Oregon that was dropped & lost in a National Forest (Lesson learned, keep it tethered).In some ways I like the Etrex22x better.It has a nonslip side and fits my hand nicely. It is one hand usable (I think light weight gloves will be ok with it). The included Open Source map is more than adequate for basic navigation. This map is updated by users and in some places provides info only a user would be able to contribute. This map has some points paper maps do not have. You can add micro SD cards for specific maps. It's helpful to compare information on several maps while backpacking.Etrex 22x has all the basic features/functions needed for general navigation.There is, of course, a learning curve. Garmin support is VERY HELPFUL. Be sure to use their expertise and learn the device BEFORE you go out.Some product info is confusing because the manual is for two GPS units (and, of course, some YouTubers are not correct).Etrex22x does NOT have a 3 axis compass or barometric altimeter. The compass only knows direction while moving (remember your magnetic compass!). The altimeter DOES know elevation from the satellite beacons. I have a barometric altimeter and have compared it to the etrex22x. I find the 22x more reliable. In TRACK MANAGER and ROUTE PLANNER you will find an elevation plot.Etrex 22x CAN BE used for automotive navigation. It WILL relocate route on roadways. It can also plan routes for bicycle and pedestrian. You must select mode of travel.Etrex 22x Open Source map DOES have some boundaries for state and federal lands. These boundaries are not as detailed as what is provided with micro SD cards, but do give the general area. Open Source maps are updated as new info becomes available. Check for updates every once-in-awhile.Overall, I am confident that the etrex 22x will track my hike and give me the info I need to navigate The White Mountain National Forest and Wilderness areas (some impressively varied terrain!), on and off trails (again, along with a magnetic compass and paper map). This replaces a much more expensive GPS unit that had a map specific card installed. It was a tough act to follow. It does well. For the money, I am impressed.",

                "reviewText": "My 13 year old son was going on a 10 mile hike with 3 of his friends in a place with no cell phone service, we got this as a primary GPS for him to use to make sure they didnt get lost as the trails are not clearly marked. We downloaded the GPX file for the trail and uploaded to the unit, he was able to follow it and mark way points along the trail. He was also using Gia Gps with the same GPX file on his phone when we got home we compared the data between the 2 devices and the data was very similar. The screen is small and the user interface is a bit dated but its basic and it works. For short hikes this is a good unit, if you need a backup for longer hikes or planning on being out for a few days this is a great secondary GPS.",

                "reviewText": "I just purchased about week ago, and I just tried few short hike with this eTrex22x. Since this is the my first GPS, it takes few days to figure it out. I was thinking over and over between two GPS for month. One is mainly for cycling, and another one is this eTrex22x which mainly for hiking. The another GPS for mainly cycling is about $100 more expensive and it has more large touches screen. Like a smart phone. Since I was looking for GPS for mainly hiking/bike tour, I choose this eTrex22x. My first impression was obviously small screen as compared to smartphones which we mostly use in daily life. But I think this design was good for grip in hand safely without dropping during the hike. And I feel comfortable and secure with gripping. And my favorite part are run by 2AA battery, so I don\u2019t need to worry about recharge like a smart phone. Just switch battery in the minute. And it run much longer hour than internal battery GPS system. And additional SD card for more memory. I didn\u2019t tried for bike tour yet, because I didn\u2019t get bike mount for eTrex22x yet.Also Garmin Base Camp for computer works fine,too.",

It is very easy to use...picks up the satellites very quickly and stayed connected even in the woods under the canopy. Because it is inexpensive it lacks a few features. You cannot delete used geocaches using the devise. You have to connect it to your computer and using a free Garmin supplied program then delete. Just a bit annoying. The plus side is the Garmin tech support is fantastic. I called them a couple of times...and got called back within minutes...with the answer. Good product...this is the 3rd Garmin GPS we have owned over the years. Will buy nothing but Garmin.",

                "reviewText": "Perfect! Exactly what we needed. Glad we purchased this unit and not a Chinese knock-off. This one is more expensive, but this is a well spent money. Most of the cost goes into a well honed software.The software is good. It performs as expected. At least for what we need. i.e: waypoints, tracks and area calculation.We use it as a track recording device and then we import the recordings and process them on a PC. We also prepare tracks on the PC, import them in the device and march them once in the field. The ability to see our current position relative to a programmed track is nice. The screen is a bit small for my aging eyes. This is not a product issue. We understand that something to be used during hiking must be small and light. Bigger is not better. Beside that a bigger screen would be very taxing on the batteries.We used the device for a few hours and the two AA alkaline batteries are still full.The color LCD screen is transflectif giving an excellent readability in full sun (which requires less back light which in turn requires less energy, hence more autonomy to the batteries).The manufacturer states an accuracy of 4 meters. When we stand still for an extended period of time, we can see our position randomly jumping around a point. Given enough time, it is possible to assume that the average position is quite accurate. For our needs, 4 meters is enough.Overall it is an excellent product. We did not test all functions.",
