                "reviewText": "This is advertised as a GPS (Global Positioning System) watch. It apparently is not. It only uses GPS satellites to reset time. It has no location functionality I could find. There's nothing in either the included, or online, manuals (which are quite different, and are both dysfunctional). I did get a response from their customer service when I said I could not find any location or navigation functionality. But the response was to ask for a video of the problem. Clearly, there's no meaningful way to show a video of a lack of functionality, so that was not helpful. I wrote, politely, to explain no video was applicable because I was not asking about a broken functionality, but one that I could not find, and explained that I wanted to know anything about the watches positioning, or navigation capabilities. I never received a reply. This watch provided some functionality, like a pretty good compass, but was overpriced for those limited capabilities. And the battery life was very bad if you weren't in the powersaver mode. But the watch was unreadable in the powersaving mode, and the illumination could not be increased without turning on all the other features (which presumably includes hooking up to the GPS system to get current time - too bad they didn't have an interface to display location).",

They offered replacement or refund due to the issues with the app. Since the App is the issue they have said that their team is working in a solution. As for now I can say that this company will go far with that kind of attitude and dedication to getting better. I hope the APP will soon be an issue of the past.This is a nice-looking smartwatch. I got this one specifically cause I liked the band and well it seems pretty well all watches are coming from out of the Country and are pretty well the same so I figured hey, can't be any better or worse than the others.The watch is boxed up quite nicely, it's not fancy which is fine cause when does a smartwatch need a fancy box. You get all the normal stupp with it charging cables and a manual. The watch has many of the same functions as others including tracking your heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and more, empowering you to make informed decisions about your health and fitness.I have had a couple of watches that used the APP this one uses and it's not that great. It crashes and doesn't update. Information gets missed and lost. If you're tracking things in your life and you need the app to download and it crashes and loses your info well, that's a problem. The best way around it is to MAKE SURE you go into the APP every single day so you're only downloading 1 day of info. I have completely fixed most of the issues that many experience just by doing this. It's quite accurate to say that the APP and such in the watch are very glitchy and do not handle data well.-the battery life is fine with 4 days at heavy usage and 7 days at normal usage.- rated IP78 which is water proof can be submersed and is good for the person who never takes their watch off except to charge it.This is a decent watch there are better watches at this price point. I would say if they could get their software and glitching of the transfers along with losing data figured out then they could stay at this price point but, I can get watches with better digital function for less.",

This rugged outdoor fitness tracker watch has quickly become an essential part of my daily life, whether I'm hitting the trails or just staying active in the city.The standout feature of this smartwatch is undoubtedly its GPS and compass functionality. As an outdoor enthusiast, I rely on accurate navigation tools, and this watch delivers on that front. The GPS tracking is incredibly precise, and the built-in compass function has been a lifesaver on numerous occasions. Whether I'm hiking in the wilderness, cycling through unfamiliar terrain, or simply trying to find my way back to my car in a crowded parking lot, this watch has been my trusty guide. The easy-to-use interface makes it a breeze to input waypoints and track my progress, and the GPS lock-on is impressively fast.One of the concerns I had when purchasing a GPS smartwatch was the battery life. I'm happy to report that this watch exceeded my expectations. With moderate use, I can easily get several days of battery life out of it. Even when using the GPS and compass functions extensively during a day-long hike, the battery still had plenty of juice left by the end of the adventure. The efficiency of the watch's power management is truly commendable and gives me the confidence to take it on extended trips without worrying about running out of battery.",

                "reviewText": "I have small wrists and finding a watch and band that fit me properly and can track my steps as well as sleep cycle accurately. This one surprised me by staying on my wrist firmly and keeping the reader where it is supposed to sit.I really enjoy the fact that I can now track my sleep and exercise cycles and see exactly where I need improvement, it even tells me when I am burning calories the most or how hard my heart is beating at all times. As a person with incredibly high anxiety I am really happy that I can now see when I need to sit down and breathe.The battery life last me about 6 days before needing recharging and is easily connected through a regular usb block. I really love that I dont have to take it off in the shower or while doing chores as it's completely water proof and incredibly durable to everyday banging around.This watch is also the most low budget watch that has accurately kept track of my steps, I only wish I could track my social media with it as well.",
