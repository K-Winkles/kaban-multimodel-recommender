And tested alongside the laser range finders used by players on the flats, in my foursome, golf buddy has no trouble being as accurate, and for us older guys with shaky hands and not as keen an eyesight, the voice activation is the greatest. No problem with recharging and maintaining the battery life for all 18 holes. And haven't yet found a golf course here locally that the golf buddy does not have a record of yardage for. The yardage keeps me in the ballpark for distance, only wish my golf shots could match the distance with the same accuracy.",

One click, and I get my yardage, whereever I'm at.However, I do feel like all the other features are a bit tricky to use and quirky -- not well explained in the manual. But I really only bought it for yardages.I keep in my pocket. I think it looks weird clipped to a hat. Like you're wearing a pace-maker for your head. But that's a personal thing. Many places you could clip it to easily. I just like pulling it out and holding it close to my ear.GPS yardages are sometimes iffy... I'll be standing next to people with rangefinders, which are probably more accurate getting slightly different readings. Thats' GPS for you. I like to give GolfBuddy a few chances. I'm not a good enough golfer for a few yards to make an actual difference...just trying to figure out if I'm about 100 or 150, ya know.Like I said, I do enjoy it, and give him Five Stars. Good price. Good gear. No biggy.",
