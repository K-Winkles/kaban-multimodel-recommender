I have owned the 78SC for years and am in the unique position to be able to compare every feature in the marine category. A difficult learning curve for sure if this is your first experience so get ready to sit for hours fiddling with it until its memorized. I decided to stick with the 78SC and returned 79SC. I think the 78SC is discontinued and for the or the record if I had to get a replacement I would buy the 79SC. By the way, the daylight (bright sunshine) screen brightness is exactly the same in both models. The indoor brightness is a bit more in the 79SC. The marine Bluechart details are very similar in both models. My advise? Get the unit, buy a canoe or kayak and enjoy. Use it to mark your hot fishing spots so you can go back.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this item to reduce use of my iPhone in the boat for fear of getting it wet. But its almost unusable. The interface is non-intuitive, the graphics are like a 1980s video game, and if you don't set it so that the screen goes dark after 30 seconds of non-use your battery dies in a couple of hours.Just buy a used iPhone or Galaxy for the same price and load the app. You'll be vastly happier.",

                "reviewText": "We use this product for sea kayaking and forest foraging. Both are situations where it's a little iffy to use you cell phone. I bought this one to replace a Garmin Oregon 400c. It's not as compact but has the same screen size (other Garmin devices in this same category have smaller screen sizes). The UI for this product works almost the same as Oregon 400c, with the exception it's not a touchscreen. This display is certainly better than the Oregon 400c when used in outdoor lighting. The Oregon 400c was terrible in outdoor lighting conditions. GPSMAP 79 is much better in outdoor lighting conditions, but I think Garmin still needs to do even better. The most disappointing thing about this device is its unintuitive UI. The user manual doesn't do an adequate job explaining the various features. You need to rely on user forums to get a better understanding. Their software \"basecamp\" which you download and run on your PC is as clunky as the devices UI. Basecamp is used so you can plan a route and add that route to your device. In basecamp, you can only have one active map opened (example of what I mean by its clunkiness). There seems to be a debate whether Gamin even still supports basecamp, but I've not found a Garmin alternative. I bought the Oregon 400c may about 10 years ago; wouldn't you think that the UI would have been vastly improved over that time span. The answer is NO! Garmin products today are so 90's style when it comes to their UI. Garmin is just not an innovative company. They seem to be the leader of the handheld GPS market, not because they deserve it, but rather due to the lack of competition. (My guess is that the GPS handheld market to probably too small for real competition.) I knew all these things when I bought the device but still purchased it because the device is rugged, waterproof, and you can depend on it for getting you back to your starting point if you get lost in the woods foraging for mushrooms and other edibles. You can't make that same claim using your cell phone with GPS. The device is well designed to save battery life. Garmin claims that you get about 19 hours of use on two AA batteries; and that's probably true! That's another reason for why you may want to use a handheld GPS device over a you cell phone (with maps cached). Garmin support is very limited; you cannot contract them via phone, chat or email to get answers. Their online support page is pretty much FAQ's.",
