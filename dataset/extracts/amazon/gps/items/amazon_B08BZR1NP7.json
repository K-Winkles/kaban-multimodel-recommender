I returned the off-brand and purchased a Garmin DRIVESMART that works like the GarminGPS in my car at home and in my F250 pulling our 5th. wheel camperGarmin gives me timely and accurate information I need in advance, be it traffic lights, stop Signs ormy next destination for another concert in Tampa Florida.
