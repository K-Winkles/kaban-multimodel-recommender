The disk did hold tight to the slightly curved dashboard, and I did get it off completely with a bit of effort. I am considering whether I should try epoxying some acrylic or so to the one of the remaining disks, but I am not clear how I am going to cut the acrylic in a circle.I may note that I tried another brand, with the same results.",

Stuck the Garmin on it and it held over the 2 weeks we were on the rode in the RV. We hit bumps hard enough that detached the Garmin from its magnetic base, but the Dashboard Pad Mounting Disk held steadfast...Going to buy another one...",
