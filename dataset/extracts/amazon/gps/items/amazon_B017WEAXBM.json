                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars BUGGY!",
                "reviewText": "The eTrex 10 GPS is incredibly buggy: the display often goes completely blank after scrolling through menus immediately after taking a fix, characters are arbitrarily deleted while entering notes on waypoints, part of the satellite page goes blank when viewing the number of satellites and their respective signal strengths, the unit often takes up to 10 seconds to update after pressing the joystick to enter data, and the joy stick often moves the cursor to the wrong data field. (This unit was a replacement for another eTrex 10 GPS that exhibited the very same problems.) But the final straw for me was when my eTrex 10 started placing all my waypoints hundreds of meters off from their true location on my topo maps (referencing WGS84 datum). On the plus side, the eTrex 10 has a powerful sensor and can get a fix very quickly. But the hassles with all the bugs really make this a toy and dangerous for serious off-trail navigators to rely on. Too bad; Garmin used to make awesome GPS units (accurate and stable units with rugged build quality) 20 years ago. If anyone knows of a reliable and lightweight GPS unit for off-trail ultra-light backpacking use (i.e., without extraneous highway maps and point-of-interest menus cluttering the GUI), PLEASE answer this review. This once-loyal Garmin user (25 years owning Garmin GPS) is now looking for something different.P.S. I talked with a Garmin support rep who helped me reset my unit; hopefully that will restore the unit's prior waypoint accuracy. But he was also surprisingly candid about how flaky the eTrex 10 GPS is, calling it \"the bane of our existence\" with regard to how many support calls they get for that particular unit. He recommended the Garmin Map64 product line for being more robust and bug-free. I'm nervously considering it.",

                "reviewText": "I've had my e Trex 10 navigator for about 2 years now, and I love it. This version has the accuracy that the previous version lacked. Most of my hikes are less than 15 miles, but many trails cross or intersect, and, in the desert, people die every year because they get lost/confused/dehydrated. A navigator is essential. I also bought the carrying case that clips to my pack. The case makes some room for the joystick controller, but not enough. The lack of space makes it awkward to move/set the controller. Other than that, I'm happy with my unit.",
