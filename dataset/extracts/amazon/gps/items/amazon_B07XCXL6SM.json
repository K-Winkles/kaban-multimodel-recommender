                "reviewText": "The Swami is a very simple \u201cno frills\u201d GPS. Read the product description carefully. It is an accurate description and don\u2019t expect anything more this unit than what it tells you. First off, the magnet is very strong and will not fall off of the carts window frame upright during use. It won\u2019t even slide down. It is very stable. It picks up GPS signal in less than a minute from power-up and \u201cplay mode\u201d is selected. The course you are at will be at the top of the list. You may have to choose which 9 hole course you are playing first if the course if flipped their 9\u2019s that day, or you play at a 27 hole course. It is simple and straightforward. The score keeping is not good on this unit. My suggestion, just keep a regular scorecard. You get three yardages and their is no hole layout. You can distances to hazards quickly by pressing the \u201cright hand arrow\u201d and pressing it again will bring you back to your regular yardage screen. This unit is $100. Spend more if you want more. I got so sick and tired of shooting pins with my laser, I find this to be a welcomed little tool. I keep my laser in my bag, but usually don\u2019t remove it anymore. I\u2019m a 9 handicap and this works fine for me.",

                "reviewText": "It really is so cool. It works great, has a nice bright screen. Resolution really is terrible for 2022 standards, but I read the specs and expected that. Magnet is strong for cart usage. Also has a belt clip that just attaches to the magnet. Seems to be accurate (but I tend to find every GPS gizmo my buddies have are all pretty accurate out on the course). However...the 6000 was clearly designed/manufactured years ago now and I'm kind of annoyed with 2 things. OK, I'm really annoyed. 1. Micro USB connector instead of USB-C. I just recently got rid off all things non-USB-C in my life and here is the Izzo Swami 6000 to ruin it all! 2. You can't charge it and use it at the same time!!!! When you connect the charger it overrides all functionality and you're stuck on a black screen with a battery meter on it.I promise to love this little device for this golf season and give our relationship an honest effort. But I do predict these 2 things are going to eat away at that love.",

It is fantastic in all aspects. Great price, charges quickly, holds charge for a long time, finds the course quicker than any other I've had, accurate and magnet sticks extremely well to metal on golf cart. It's small enough to put into your pocket when you need to walk across the fairway but screen is large enough to easily read when it's mounted on the cart. If you're looking for a great little GPS for a great price, this is it.",

I like this enough that when mine broke andwas out of warranty I purchased another identical one. Then I contacted the company to see if they could fix my original one. The charging port had come loose and was inside the device so that I couldn't plug in my charging cable. You can't take these apart so I was out of luck. When I contacted them to see if they could fix it, they were kind enough to replace my out of warranty device with a refurbished one. Now I have two of them and I find this a great thing because if I forget to charge one I have a backup. Thanks very much to the company for standing behind their product and caring about their customers. They get me as a customer for life!!!",

Amazon\u2019s return policy is simple/easy to follow and worked seamlessly\u2026..full marks.#2. Izzy Support was extremely professional, and although they were unable to repair the unit, they were great to work with\u2026..full marks.The replacement unit was received in record time. The replacement unit is working well. It is simple to use and I enjoy the magnetic function that allows the operator to mount the gps unit where it is easy to view. I did hear about users who left the unit on the cart when leaving in a hurry. I have addressed this concern by using a storage case. I use an old eye glass case, that I put in the cart, with the belief that I will see the empty case and remember to grab the gps unit. We will see. I have found that the batteries last two full rounds before recharging.",
