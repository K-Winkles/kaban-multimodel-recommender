                "reviewText": "i own two of these GPS Devices. First one was brand new and then i ordered this certified refurbished product. Initially i was skeptical whether it's going to work just like the new one i had before.to my surprise, the product works just perfect as if it's new. there were no scratches on the gps when it arrived. All the accessories came along with it.regarding the features in the GPS, i really like the option of life time map updates plus traffic updates. I use this on regular basis and it's nice to see the gps providing me alternative router options to my destination if there is any traffic delay on one of the planned routes. The \"Voice Command\" is also useful on daily basis.....as there is no need to look at the gps and deviate your eyes off the road....i just say Voice Command - Go Home. That's it. in general, i see many people using their cell phones for the GPS option...i do have unlimited data plan subscribed for my cell phone...however i strongly recommend not to use Cell phone as a gps, this is even more true if you need gps application frequently....",

I like the features, and it is incredibly accurate.Update:When this arrives you will take it out of the box and play with it, like I did. That's OK, but Before you actually use it to navigate you should hook it to a computer and go to Garmin's web site and update the map software. Don't be in a hurry as this can take a couple hours or more, depending on your internet speed. But once it's done you should be good to go.I love this unit and would recommend it to anyone, and will definitely look at a Garmin if I want another one.",

Yeah I know it is a factory refurb, but I couldn't tell. I fired it up, hooked it to the computer and updated all the maps, etc. Working just fine.

It does not come with a paper manual but you can download a pdf file of it. I did allot of research on which gps unit to buy and this one had all the features I wanted. It has voice command, bluetooth for his phone, and multiple destination trip planner with optimizer at a good price. It was a little difficult to figure out at first and I'm sure we still don't know how to use or even know all the features it has. It is an older unit so if you have the latest smart phone the touch screen will be a little getting used to. I updated the maps and traffic as soon as I got it. It tells you the speed limit and your current speed. For the most part it was correct but don't rely on it because it still said the limit was 70 when the small town signs said 55. It took him to all the correct addresses except for 1 or 2. He just pulled out his phones gps and looked up the address there to get a more precise location. Be careful entering in your location because it changes the address completely if it didn't recognize what you input. Sometimes having to spell out interstate highway instead of IH and other common abbreviations for addresses. There are apps out there for your smart phone you can use easier for a multiple trip however the gps drains your phone battery quickly and also uses alot of data, and not allowing more than a certain amount of destinations before you have to pay for a premium app. Overall I'm happy with my purchase.",

I had a prior one, same model but for some reason after doing a map upgrade the voice command stopped working. Factory could not explain why. Bought the refurbished for cheap money back then. Should have bought a couple more.",
