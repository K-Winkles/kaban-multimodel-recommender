App's tracker location playback should have a single-step button.3. App needs a \"copy address to clipboard\" button to easily transfer the displayed address to something else, or even a \"directions\" button to open Google maps.4. Not clear how to find out current battery level of tracker.",

                "reviewText": "Affordable tracking. This is actually a legitimate GPS tracker for significant assets. Air tags, tile, smarttag depend on pinging off of someone else's device in that network. Also, airtags will alert a thief that is carrying an iphone.This is subscription based, but over a two-year subscription (I chose 3 minute tracking for my tractor) it's $10 per month. Worst case scenario, it will get me within 1 mile of the location if stolen and they run at top speed in between pings, until they stop for three minutes, then it is exact.I was impressed with the location accuracy- it definitely uses GPS/Glonass/Galileo- I have compared to my other GPS only and the accuracy is much better. I don't know if this applies everywhere, but at my place the tracker seems to be accurate within about 1 yard.The tracker comes with a geofencing app, which I would like to be more customizable. It does put a geofence on the tracker that tells me if it is moving, but I would like to set my own fences so that I don't have to manually turn it off when I mow a field. Maybe it already does, I'm still learning the app.Anyway. Good stuff. Buy it.",
