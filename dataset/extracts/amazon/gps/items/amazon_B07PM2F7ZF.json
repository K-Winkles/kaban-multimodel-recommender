                "reviewText": "5/23/21: Received the GPS. As another person reported the brand new golf GPS does not fully charge. I've had it charging 16 hours. It got up to 78% within a few hours. The charge didn't increase after several more hours. I disconnected and reconnected the charger and it then reported 84% and now bounces between that and 81% charged. I will see how it performs tomorrow. The buttons also seem sticky. I'll update after I take it on the course. So far I am disappointed.5/24: I used it during play. The power indicator dropped one bar after the 4th hole. The GPS functioned well throughout the round. Yardage was off by 5 - 10 yards on a few holes as compared to my dying TomTom, Golf Pad on my phone and a friend's Garmin. Auto advance worked well. It appeared to periodically (maybe every 15 - 30 seconds) update yardage rather than almost continuously. It was noticeable at times. I'd have to look several times to get the final yardage. Maybe that saves on battery life. I also found no hazard info on some holes. I don't have enough experience with it to know if that is rare or a common missing data item. Time will tell. I'll update in a few days and decide if I am going to return/exchange for a new one. I have not heard back from the manufacturer.5/26: The GPS never fully charged maxing out at 81% while charging for almost two full day days. The indicator showed it was charging the entire time. I used it for another round today. The power indicator decreased 1 bar by the 3rd hole tee and was almost empty by the time I was leaving the parking lot - less than 3 hours of usage - I play fast. I also noticed there was no hazard information on a lot of holes. I am letting it completely discharge before charging one more time. Maybe doing so will reset the battery. If not, I will be sending the unit back to Amazon. Still nothing from the manufacturer.6/2/21: I processed an exchange with Amazon to try another unit. It only charged to 81%. I took it (and the older one that I haven't returned yet) to the course today. The replacement unit is horrible. The forward and back buttons do not work. I press and press and hold them and nothing. I reset the unit several times, still those buttons don't work. They started us on the 10th hole so it was really a noticeable problem. I am returning it shortly. What a shame. They seem to be well designed but the manufacturing and quality control kill it. I don't know what else to say.6/7/21: I returned the faulty replacement and have kept the original one. I took the suggestion of another poster and now remove the unit from the charger once it reaches 81% for a while which is the maximum it will reach. Interestingly, the unit reports fully charged at least halfway through the round of golf when I do that. For such low cost GPS it seems to be worth trying. I hope it will last.",

I would not recommend this product due to the clip breaking making it useless",
