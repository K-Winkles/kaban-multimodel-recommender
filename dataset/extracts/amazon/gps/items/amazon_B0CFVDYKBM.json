                "reviewText": "Since these attach to the collar using two straps in the middle, it leaves the ends unsupported. It makes it easy to get caught on fences while jumping over and could lead to extreme danger!! Stick to the Brand Covers that attach to the collar at the ends; that keeps the entire device secure. Cats fight and jump so when you have a device that leaves room to get caught on things, that can put the animal in danger. Do NOT buys these!!!! These definitely need a MAJOR remake done on them. They are nice and thick but the simple fact that they do not attach to the collar at the ends makes these life threatening.",

This had the potential to be something really great, but they added features that destroyed the functionality entirely. I liked the design in theory, because you could charge it without taking the cover off. But the way they made the cover, you cannot use the Tractive blue stretchy collar holder thing. So this little silicone cover itself is supposed to hold the device onto your pet's collar. But the little strappy straps broke literally as I was putting the device into the holder! What the heck? Why would they even make something so useless. Why would somebody put money into the development and creation and production and distribution of something that breaks the moment you even start to use it?
