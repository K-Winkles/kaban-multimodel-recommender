This is a Linux based single board computer much like a Raspberry Pi3. I first set it up to work with Chrony and it worked fine. I have since gone to using Conky and it works a treat. I am able to get lock with 15 satellites from in side the house! Very good reciever once you get the software side of things sorted. Will be buying another in the future.",

It has firmware ver. 1.00 and can't be updated since it has no eprom but still seems to work pretty well. It installed without any problems in Windows 10 running the U-Blox utility u-center and also worked OK in Google Earth. To get it working in Linux is a bit harder and I had to follow the steps shown on the Canada GPS website entitled \"How to connect an usb GPS receiver with a Linux computer?\" When first setup it takes quite a while to get started since it's data is blank and didn't do much for nearly 3 hours indoors but then it will take right off each time after that so it must have a buile in battery. It also seems to need to be stuck onto a metal surface for best reception.",

It's very accurate and I've been able to pinpoint weather balloon landing locations by driving almost right to the location it landed at. I can see me on a map to match the weather balloon location is how this tool comes to use. I could also use it with my astronomy equipment but I don't know how. As I can tell it will also be good for that too. I didn't install drivers and I use Windows 11 on a laptop. It may have installed the drivers for me when I plugged it in. It sticks to the roof of my car, but I use it on my dash. It won't stick to anything there, so I got a little clamp to hold wires and used it to hold the GPS pug to the dash. GPS lock seems to be instant. I've never noticed a delay.",

Now, the return window is closed and all it does is spit out empty NMEA sentences, as if it cannot see any satellites at all. It has never been used outside, on a vehicle - only indoors from my windows. I'm disappointed that taking good care of the device didn't help its longevity and I cannot recommend it.",
