                "reviewText": "Initially I was concerned that this Edge Explore may not live up to advertised claims (because it was a refurbished unit -- I didn't want to spend between 200-300$ to get a Garmin bike computer - (it replaced a low end Sigma that was not holding its charge). Here's my experience after two days (two rides): 1) very easy to set up - link to iphone 13 with the Garmin Connect; 2) Immediately connects to GPS! 3) Out of the box, couldn't tell it wasn't new (I did not purchase two year extended protection - reviews indicated that it probably wasn't needed); 4) Make sure to download Garmin Express on your PC or Mac -- software was one version between; very easy to update software from computer! 5) After one ride, battery reading was 83% (reason I gave it a 4 and not 5) - not sure if this is good or bad just a little more drain that I expected. Overall, I am very pleased with the this Garmin bike computer -- probably has more features than I will use; my only regret is that I did not get a Garmin a year or two ago! I would definitely buy this (refurbished) product again -- very good price/value!",

                "reviewText": "There are plenty of reviews for features, pros, cons, etc.My experience so far:Bought this to use as a backup to my Garmin Edge 520. If you have had a Garmin in the past then you know the setup process with your phone and how to navigate the unit. It\u2019s easier on this unit to setup the data screens because of the touch screen rather than buttons only. Mine came with the standard mount with bands, no out in front mount which I I already had anyways. I did update my unit from Garmin Express to have the latest maps which for me was 5.40 on a US model. The only things that I use that are missing from this unit compared to my 520 are the Di2 data and having multiple data screens. You can only officially set up 3 screens with data which TBO is more than enough. 2 customs and the map screen can have 2 data fields. You can download IQ apps that have custom data fields but I am ok with the standard ones. If you use a power meter, Di2 or Strava Segments then look elsewhere.The unit itself looks brand new just like others have stated. I was a little skeptical about condition and battery life but have no fear! This unit looks great and the battery is on par with expected life listed. I have done 5 rides totaling almost 6 hours and the battery is at 27%. One ride I used the \u201cnavigate to start\u201d to test the feature which worked great. Much better than my 520 with open maps since you can actually get full guidance on the this unit rather than just the base map. I did leave the brightness on the lowest setting but IMO you can see it just fine in most conditions. There is a setting to time out the screen after a few seconds which I imagine would conserve the battery but I didn\u2019t enable that setting for now. Maybe if I really needed to conserve the battery I probably would try it.Overall this is a great purchase. For the price of this unit and the 2 year warranty purchased separately, this should last me until Garmin comes out with a new unit to replace the 530 or 830 that has a bigger screen and one that doesn\u2019t cost $600.",

Mounted it on my quad came in very handy for exploring and getting home,lot's of places to get lost around here. This one is mounted on my MTB . Does essentially same thing as original with a lot of added bells and whistles. The smartphone connection is nice ,I know it works because I went down on my bike and it notified my girlfriend . User interface is way better than original but still can be a little challenging too many features . LOL .Bluetooth is solid . GPS connection is solid. Maybe I'm just used to the old sketchy days of GPS connections but it really seems solid to me. What more can I say than that it works, that's coming from someone who had first GPS way before cell phones .",

I live in an area that is littered with bike trails that criss-cross and wind for miles (which makes sense). I tried doing the loops while using a bike app but I still overshot a couple of turns. Enter this unit. It has the option of \"building\" custom maps that give turn by turn directions which can really come in handy if you are like me and get caught up in pedaling and not watching where you are going. It displays time, distance, speed, etc. You can also link it to your phone and upload your activity to Strava. It can also be expanded to add sensors like heartrate, cadence, etc. The only downfall I have found is it does not link to my Apple Watch for heart rate. Small sacrifice. I got the refurbished unit to save some money and I have found no difference in condition. If you are thinking about it, do it.",

It came with a lanyard, charging cable, and stem mount. I bought a forward mount (like the pros use) for under $15 because I didn\u2019t want it on my stem. I\u2019m very happy with it",

                "reviewText": "Bought this product refurbished. Never again!! It has not worked correctly since I bought in July 2022. I tried to call Garmin for assistance and they wanted to trouble shoot it, but the Garmin was not doing what is was doing while I was riding, so there was nothing to trouble shoot. Long story short, the screen blacks out completely - not able to see my ride metrics while riding. The screen will also lock up on a particular screen and not do anything at all. I have to take it home and plug it back up for it to \"come out of its lock mode!\" and it will not sync automatically (even though it is set up to do it) with my phone after any rides. I have to manually do it and most times I have to wait before it will let me do it. It will say \"upload failed!\" Not sure if anyone else is having these types of issues, but I dont recommend buying a refurbished Garmin from anyone. It is definitely a waste of money that I could have used towards a new product.",

                "reviewText": "The unit is like new! Couldn't find a scratch or blemish. The unit works as advertised, no install issues, no operational issues, no update issues, no map updating issues. Just flawless!I got it on sale for my daughter, turns out to be about the same price as lower end simple GPS units but this has routable cycle map for North America free, with free map update and a large color screen, its like a car gps that happens to have trails on it. This is a road bike touring computer, but has the same map as my Edge 530 so all the trails show up on it and I can push Trailforks courses to it via my daughter's phone. However is does not have mountain the bike app, like how much time you spent in the air. Not an issue as we don't jump or try not to, but for $139 Canadian, you can't go wrong. The Edge Explore 2 screen protection glass/film will fit this device, however the cases may not.",
