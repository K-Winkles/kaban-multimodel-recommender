                "reviewText": "So I've only been using for three days. I read many amazon reviews as well as elsewhere. In a measure of good vs bad, the only bad is the devices size. And I chose it knowing it's pretty large compared to many others. My hope is that means it has more battery power. If it can go a month between charges I'll be happy. I'm placing it out of sight but I'm not actually trying to fight \"bad behavior\" so the fact that James Bond can't hide it in a watch doesn't bother me.The things I found good, some unexpected. Several people complained about lack of instructions. It has some brief instructions that get you started and not much more. But setup is kind of linier. Step 2 is really the only action that can follow step 1, step 3 is really the only thing that can follow step 2. Now they say and reviewers have said that if the device doesn't connect to the ap immediately you should walk around a little. This is BS. It takes more time for them to connect that \"you think it should.\" I live in an area with no issue connecting to cellular. It didn't connect immediately. I got in the car and drove around. After about a half hour they connected. In retrospect, thinking it would connect immediately is a bit crazy. Now that my ap and the tracker know each other it connects immediately and in fact it's track even while I'm not looking and shows me the path the tracker took while I was not even logged in.It tracks to within about 3 feet but it seams to be about 20 to 40 seconds behind. I drove around with it tracking and the phone on my dash. It shows me about 1/2 a mile ago but does follow the correct path. Stop at a red light and it pretty much catches up while you wait for the light but of course shows you leaving it about a half minute after you actually did. I feel like it shows the path of travel for almost the whole day. I went to a location, stayed there for about an hour then went somewhere else before returning. The entire path was visible but next day was a clean slate.Some things I didn't expect, the ap connects to Google. So it can show you as best as google has photographed, a picture of where (house, neighborhood, parkinglot, what ever) the device is sitting. Because it is connected to google and assuming your phone knows where it is, it will give you turn by turn directions to get from where you are to where it is. Now not for monitoring but I have real life experience of getting a call \"We don't know where we are but we are having some trouble. I think the town is called (and they gave me the wrong name...)\" Armed with this device I could literally have tapped the screen and it would have given me specific directions and an estimate of how long it will take. For me, that is worth the price of admission. Maybe the rest do it too, I don't know.The removal detector is a light sensor in the middle of the magnet. If it gets pulled from what it's stuck to it's going to know it. If it's not stuck to something then maybe it'll go off \"randomly.\" The fix is, stick it to something. I have it in a SUV and it is not horizontal, under the rear deck and is having no issue with signal and reception.Also you can pay your monthly (or whatever time period you select) through Amazon so if you are like me and not too sure about giving your CC number to yet another company it's an option. I thought I'd try it monthly before I commit and assuming the remainder of the month goes as well as the past few days I'll likely switch to yearly. This is not the cheapest device but I would say it was on the inexpensive end of the list and absolutely was the lowest monthly. Watch out for the no monthly fee devices, what they don't tell you is you will need to set up an account with your cellular carrier for anywhere from 20-40 bucks a month.The funny thing is being a German company when you login the map is centered on Germany and then quickly skips over to my neighborhood in the USA. I gave 5 stars for Support but never used support. IMO the best customer support is the one you don't need. Also 5 for batter life, we'll call that wishful thinking but I suspect it's got better life than some much smaller device.",

Purchases the Salind 11 4g. It worked the first hr that I activated it. I was able to see it moving. The next morning I noticed that it was stuck in standby mode as the wife drove away. Once she came home I reset the device. It worked well and it got my trust back. Well, it failed 30 min into my wives trip and they won't be able to reset until they reach their destination, but that just won't do. I had to resort to checking in every few hours with them. I did reach out to the company and they responded well. Unfortunately, seems like they can't do anything about it remotely because they tried and it still showing up in my state. This experience is a failure. I have a paid subscription that was already taken for a service that was not rendered. I own a brand new lansind11 that I have no trust in becsuse it wont track. I wish I had the device so I can return it and be done with it.",

                "reviewText": "So my first tracker I ordered off Amazon had an issue when trying to activated. It was telling me that the tracker number was not correct even though it was. After 10 times or more to activate I gave up. Got a replacement in from Amazon an it activated immediately. The replacement Tracker works beautiful. Has a very strong magnet. Definitely want fall off. I\u2019m giving 4 stars because the first tracker had issues. If the first tracker would have worked I would of have 5 stars without issue.Few month update.So I\u2019ve had this a few months now. I have to say I still love it. I don\u2019t think the speed part of it is accurate. What I can say at 30days I still had 7% to 12% battery life left. Now I didn\u2019t check it but a few times in this past month. So if you prob checked it each day the battery life would go prob at least 30 days.",

                "reviewText": "I've tried about every tracker you can buy on Amazon from battery powered to wired trackers with a direct hookup and this one is way above the rest. There aren't different tiers to purchase that make your experience vary. It's like $7.99 a month with the option to purchase insurance for like 2.99 a month and they'll replace your device if it breaks or is compromised or anything like that. But I like that it's 1 price and you get everything they offer without having to pay more and it's way cheaper than most the other good trackers. It's the only tracker that I have used where you can watch whatever your tracking, their movement in real time which is nice. The other trackers that I know of that have similar features they aren't in real time they show you their movement afterwards. The best feature about this one being a battery powered device is the battery life is insane! It was delivered to me on 5/24 it's now 6/27 and it still has 18% battery left which should last another 2-3 weeks! Best battery life I got out of any other tracker was about 8 days. I'm over 30 days and still going with this one and it's attached to a vehicle that travels 100+ miles a day and makes 15-20 stops and I do not have it on eco mode or power save mode. I would recommend just for that reason. Less charging more tracking. Only complaint is there aren't much detailed options to look at the history unless I just haven't figured it out yet. Lol",
