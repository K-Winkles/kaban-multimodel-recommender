                "reviewText": "I decided to buy the Lightning GPS device with the magnetic case after loosing not one but TWO of my most sea worthy and expensive boat skiffs in less than a year to either unsuspecting thieves, or by the occurrence of mother nature's wrath being on the open ocean. Less than a month ago I just put my second dingy in the water after recently having it fiberglassed, painted and gel coated to have it dissappear right off the map a week later. With only one skiff left to my name, I was sick to my stomach over the thought of putting it in the water until I learned about this fantastic GPS gadget. I purchased it while it was discounted during Amazon Prime Day. It arrived three days later which was really awesome because ever since the onset of COVID I honestly can't remember the last time I received anything from Amazon in less than a week or usually more. I opened it up as soon as my package arrived and charged it up. This requires a teeny amount of patience on the end users behalf, ( standard battery charging time for the unit requires 4-5 hours). In the meantime, you may want to consider reading a book, watching the Titanic for the 1000th time cooking up a pot roast, or even going out for a hike. It's worth the wait, I promise! Besides, the battery is designed to last approximately two weeks. So, on day one...I decided to test it on my canoe, and I must say ... right out the gate I was beyond super impressed within less than the first hour it was in operation! This product delivers with 100% tack sharp precision!I left the canoe tied up to my anchor line and drove an hour away home. I opened up the corresponding app that tracks and accurately pinpoints all the activities of any given asset the GPS device is attached to. It shows all the history since its inception, of everywhere it goes, date/ time how many miles traveled, speed etc. THIS BABY IS AWESOME! There are too many features to list, which involves time to make configurations and possessing a fair amount of technical knowledge to establish geo fences and such, but it's not required for just basic purposes. Yes, you do need a subscription which the website is provided in the box along with instructions on charging the unit and downloading the app. The website is pretty straightforward, offering multiple tiers sign-up levels and pricing options to choose from (depending on ones own individual or business needs). In addition, they give you the choice to add-on device insurance for right around $4 +/- which is a minimal investment in comparison to paying full price. The benefit of purchasing the add-on insurance allows you the peace of mind for free replacement should your device ever become lost, stolen, or damaged. They also provide free customer support for anyone who may need or requires personal assistance. I'm so glad I chose Lightening GPS services to be my eyes on my personal property when I'm not available. All in all- 5 Stars! Excellent product! I will definitely purchase again in the future for use on my bigger boats.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first time buying a GPS tracker. Got it for tracking our cars in case of any theft. So far after a month of use it\u2019s running solid. Last up to 1-2 weeks depends on how much driving you\u2019re doing before needing to charge it. The app will let you know how much battery is left. Depending on your need, you can determine what type of tier you want for the subscription tracking service but for 3 months only $100 for tracking every 30 sec not bad. Really accurate, the case as shown in the picture is very sturdy & the magnet is STRONG. It\u2019s not small to be discrete enough but if you hide it in a good place I don\u2019t think someone will notice it\u2019s even there with how the case is. Would definitely Recommend this to someone, will update in about 3 months.",

                "reviewText": "I really loved the way the gps attaches to the car with a strong well built magnet protection cover, the way the battery lasts (15 days) and the precision of the tracking. They also offer a variety of plans to chose what fits in your pocket. Recently I chatted with Gen that precisely answered me on a Saturday evening about all the details and options of my plan. He was very clear , direct and concise. So I would say the quality and service is overall is fantastic.",

                "reviewText": "After doing some research I decided to get the Lightning GPS GL300 GPS Tracker mainly due to the low(er) monthly fee as well as the basic functionality I wanted. There have been a lot of stolen cars these days and I wanted to get a tracker with the hopes that if my car is stolen (knock on wood) I would be able to get it back. I was on a trip for 21 days and fully charged it and left it in my car. I got the magnetic box to hold it and I have it in my trunk. The reception is fine, no issues. This was a good test for battery life. The battery died around day 19. I think the extended battery might be good if you are thinking of going to be away longer or don't want to charge it as much. The charge takes about 4 hours IIRC. The instructions are not totally clear, but their Cust Support responded pretty quickly. I only wanted to set up a geofence and have alerts to my phone and email. You can only do this from a computer and not from the app. Anyway, so far so good.",

I guess it depends on traveling time, but I have been getting a good nine days for a charge!",
