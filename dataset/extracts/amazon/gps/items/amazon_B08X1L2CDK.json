I previously owned a S10 which did the same thing but the S12 does a bit more. I can add the CT10 sensors to the S12. I can pair it to my phone to look at stats afterwards. I can look at where the traps and water hazards are by a quick push of a button. It pairs quickly to the outerspace GPS machine floating around the earth. A black and white number screen, not color. I dont need color - I know what color the green is. I also like the price. I tried the S62 and didnt have the patience to remember what buttons to push to see info. All I need to know is how far the hole is and how far a hazard is. The S12 does it.",

                "reviewText": "I had been using a hand held range finder until one day I played with a group of men who all were wearing GPS watches. I looked it up, and purchased this. I also changed out the strap to a velcro loop style.Pros:Very light weight.Accuracy seems consistent with range finder, and it's much easier to get distance by looking at your wrist.Able to get lay-up distances, and distances to hazards.Relatively inexpensive.Good contrast in bright daylight, easy to read.Stroke entry works well.Cons:Fairway and hazard visualization is not as good as the expensive color models.Too many steps to \"measure shot\" or \"change hole position\"Battery life is as claimed, but it is too short and requires recharge too often.More steps than one would like to get distances to front and back of hazards.Other:Like any GPS watch, it doesn't actually know distance to the hole. My solution is, when in range of the green for the range finder, to compare the \"Center of Green\" from the watch to an actual range finder \"distance to pin\", and use the difference for other future shots at pin.To replace the original band, I recommend:https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08DD57SHV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1It is inexpensive, lightweight, and much easier to put on or remove.Overall, an excellent compromise between weight, cost, and functionality",

Anyway, I never used all the features of the S60. All I want is a solid golf GPS watch, and this is it. I have played 2 rounds without recharging and the battery is still at about 75%. Much lighter and thinner than the S60. Very accurate when compared to friend\u2019s GPS devices and range finder lasers. This is a winner. Incidentally, I bought a glass screen protector and rubber plugs for the charging port for a couple bucks. They came in a combo pack.I set the numbers to the larger format and they are super easy to see at a glance. The face is easy to read in bright sunlight. I really like this so far. I will update if needed.",

First use it found my home course (New Mexico) after taking just a bit longer than expected to synch to the satellite. Put me on the correct hole - started on #10 on the back-side. Coolest part (I'll probably get over it, but) is watching the remaining yardage 'count down' as you walk to your next shot. Love that. Accuracy seems right on compared to on-course yardage markers (which my home course as precision few of). Yes, it is an entry-level yardage watch. For my talent level (9 hndp) it is perfect to inform my club selection. I would like the watch to be back-lit for around the clock wear. But, I quibble.",
