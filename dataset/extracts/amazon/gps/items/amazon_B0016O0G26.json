        "description": "GARMIN 010-00321-31 GPS 18x USB. The GPS 18x is a GPS sensor targeted to OEM clients for use in automotive, fleet vehicle, and electronics applications where a small, highly accurate GPS receiver is needed. This 12 parallel channel, WAAS enabled GPS receiver is available in either CMOS level serial or USB 2. 0 full speed versions, and comes with an integrated magnetic base. The puck like receiver is 2. 4 inches in diameter and weighs just ounces, making it an ideal solution in applications where space is at a premium. The GPS 18x is offered in three different cable configurations: A style USB, DB 9 pin serial with 12 volt cigarette lighter adapter /PC, or bare wire /LVC. The PC and LVC versions both default to output data in the industry standard NMEA 0183 data format, but may also be user programmed to output data in the GARMIN proprietary format. The USB version produces data only in the GARMIN proprietary format. All three versions of the GPS 18 come complete with non volatile memory for storage of configuration information, a real time clock, and raw measurement output data for sophisticated customer applications. The LVC version additionally provides a pulse per second logic level output whose rising edge is aligned to the UTC second within 1 microsecond. The USB 2. 0 full speed version of the GPS18 is also compatible with USB 1. 1 full speed hosts.",

It DOES work with Garmin GPS PC software very well and quite accurately! Two out of three isn't too bad! This appears to be much more accurate than the standard Delorme sensor and Bluetooth sensor as well. This one seems to be made of far more superior material that will stand up against the elements a bit more than the other. So far I am quite impressed with it's accuracy and quick power up and program recognition ability. If I need another one the you can bet that THIS is the one that I will go to buy again for another vehicle to use!",

My first gave up the ghost after a lot of years due to abuse to it's USB connector. This one works just as well.Interfaces well with the DeLorme laptop mapping software. Unit is weatherproof and durable, and has a strong magnet in the base. Generally, I find leaving it on the dashboard is very sufficient for good results.Cable is long enough to comfortably reach the laptop anywhere in 4 passenger vehicle.A little pricy, but worth it. Depending upon your computer you may need the DeLorme \"Spanner\" software, or you may need to download drivers for the unit. I found it worked out the box with Windows 7 Pro.",

El receptor en si, es reconocido en ordenador solo a traves de un emulador [GpsGate], sin este software el sensor no se puede emplear en windows. Lo peor es que al actualizar el windows (desde Windows Aniversary hasta ahorra), hay un conflicto entre sistema operativo y los drivers de Garmin (incompletos y obsolentos, ultima version en feb. 2019, que no corrige errores). Este conflicto en concreto hace que el receptor Garmin no es reconocido como una entrada por usb... Por otra parte tras actualizar windows, no se por que razones, el receptor aun que tenga cojidos entre 8 y 10 satelites, manda una informacion al Automapa, como \"se\u00f1al gps debil\". Consecuencia: con este receptor no se puede navegar en tiempo real. Hasta dia de hoy no hay ninguna solucion ofrecida por parte de Garmin. Si te quieres gastar entre 60 y 80 euros en un producto que ya no interesa a Garmin mantenerlo al dia, es tu eleccion....",
