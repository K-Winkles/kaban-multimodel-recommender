I also enjoy how simple the phone app is to pull up and immediately see where all my cars are located at any given time.

I'm still learning all the capabilities of the tracker, most of which I don't need, but if you have a fleet of vehicles, or your want to maintain detailed metrics on the usage/cost of operation, this product should do a great job for you. Their tech support team, especially Julius is outstanding and very helpful.Happy Holidays!I've only had the device a couple of weeks, but so far I'm mostly happy with it's capabilities. The installation was quick and easy, although the wiring is short and could be a problem for you depending on the location you need to attach it to the car. The software is somewhat daunting and confusing and I'm still working on going through the tutorials, so hopefully things will start to fall into place soon. The pricing for the monthly service is misleading in that to have access to up to date info on the location of your vehicle more than three times each 24 hours, you have to pay quite a bit more per month to have unlimited data, which was very disappointing, but might be justified, depending on the strength and reliability of the product. I'll write an update in a couple of months.",

                "reviewText": "So far it seems to work really well! It has exceeded my expectations, honestly! I thought there would possibly be issues because the Apple Air Tag I had purchased for the same purposes LITERALLY only worked when the car was parked directly in front of the house, which is something I didn't need a tracking device to tell me!I opted to pay for a year of service because it comes out to be less that way, but it still cost over $200. But it has several different services and notifications available within the app which makes it worth it.The install and set up was quick and easy! Well, kind of! Discovered a stripped bolt on the negative battery terminal which ended up having to be replaced, but that had nothing to do with the device! And I really like that it's hard wired and not something that I need to remember to take off and recharge every week, because for sure I would forget!!It isn't quite as inconspicuous as the manufacturer claims being that it is about 4\"x2\" and has to be mounted in a specific and not hidden way to ensure accuracy, but that part wasn't a concern for me seeing as how it was for my own car!

                "reviewText": "Husband hooked it up to car battery w/ ease. Took about 8 hrs (overnight) to sync up completely w/ the GPS. But after that it was good to go. Online tutorials are very helpful to learn all the applications. Some we don't need. We use it mainly for tracking new teen driver, speed and car location. Will a be handy if car is ever stolen....you never know....Update 3 months later: This GPS still gives me a peace of mind and works great - WHEN it works. Apparently, it doesn't like cold weather and it won't track reliably, nor monitor the vehicle on those days. It is only Fall in the eastern U.S. and hasn't even hit below freezing weather yet. This is unfortunate because I really like the product when it works.Update 6 months later: still happy with the performance of this GPS - WHEN it works. Unfortunately, it is not reliable during the winter temperatures in the mid-eastern USA. On most days below 30 F degrees, it reports that the car has remained in my driveway when it has actually been gone for hours. This is disappointing \ud83d\ude25",
