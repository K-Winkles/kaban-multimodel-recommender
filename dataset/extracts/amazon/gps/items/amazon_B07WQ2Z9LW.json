                "reviewText": "There were so many GPS units to look at on Amazon- I basically selected the highest rated one even though I secretly felt more comfortable with a Garmin unit because I use a Garmin running watch and it's fantastic. So we were literally heading out the door to drive 6 hours away when my amazon package arrived. Perfect timing. I was afraid it would take a long set up or need wifi to update or something. However after I turned it on I set the time to GPS time and entered the location and mounted it to the windshield with the included hardware and away we went. This is the way it should work. Very happy. We've used it a few times and there are some backwoods mountain areas where the GPS veers off the highway a bit, but never for more than 30 seconds and it doesn't affect my driving. The only thing I would recommend is if we could dim the screen even more. Driving at night, even at the lowest setting, the screen is pretty bright so it's not a super smooth transition going from the GPS unit to the dark road. That's my only critique. Otherwise it works well as advertised. Touch screen is responsive and perfect size. Less than $60. Do you have any idea what our forefathers had to do for navigation??? Thanks so much. Oh, the default speed limit warning was annoying but I quickly turned it off. Never had to look at the instruction manual which is nice when the software is intuitive and self explanatory.",

                "reviewText": "Updating my review: I\u2019ve now been using the GPS since October and am still loving it. It\u2019s provided more accurate directions than either of the maps apps I have on my phone. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to buy this. Spend $57.00 on this very options-filled GPS or spend an extra $2000.00 to have a factory GPS in your vehicle when you buy it. There\u2019s nothing to not like about this GPS. The touch screen is as good as the touch screen in my girlfriend\u2019s Denali Acadia and it responds as fast if not faster. The suction mount for the dash keeps it securely in place and it doesn\u2019t vibrate when on a bumpy road. It also has a shroud that covers the sides and root to keep any sun glare out. The screen is nice and bright and a perfect size for an add-on GPS. I\u2019m amazed at the quality and sturdiness of it. I figured I wouldn\u2019t get much for $57.00 but it was to my surprise that I was way wrong. I\u2019m buying a few more for my family members that do t already have one. I would highly recommend this to anyone even thinking about buying a GPS for their vehicle because you will be as pleasantly surprised as I was when you get it. What a great add-on for my Ford Edge!",

No instructions for assembling all the little plastic pieces. After reviewing the entire instruction pamphlet, we used the \"your best guess\" method. They also do not provide definitions for unusual terms, like the instructions for the LORRY.. What the heck is that! Not a common term in my area.Like: Haven't had a need to use the GPS yet but did play with it. And it is more user friendly than our old one (different brands of course).

                "reviewText": "As the title says, too much glare. The screen is so reflective it's like a mirror and I couldn't see the screen a lot of the time. Night time isn't so bad but they really need a dull finish screen like computer monitors. The owners manual is small and very tough to read with such small print. The manual doesn't cover everything about this GPS. As with all GPS units there is too much bloatware. The connection for holding the unit to the windshield, on the back of the GPS, is cheesy and falls off on rougher roads. Luckily I had a sturdier clamp type of holder to replace it. The biggest problem though remains the excessive amount of glare on the screen.",

                "reviewText": "I do not normally write a review, but after calling Amazon about the problem I was told others were having the same problem, that is \"not able to insert the house number into the address.\" Why did I need the NAVRUF? I Drive a 2016 Corvette Stingray, and it already has On Star installed (at a fee $30/month). I would not want to be without it. I purchased the Corvette New, with the On Star installed. However, recently I try to start the car, and it would not start. I contacted On Star, and within minutes a technician was there to help. He believed the car needed a new battery. He installed a new battery. The car still would not start. So I had to have the car towed to the dealer. All of the above was covered financially by On Star. It was a Friday so the dealer was not able to work on the car until Monday. But, I needed a car. So I rented one. It did not have a GPS system, so I tried using internet Maps. I got lost. It was then that I realized I needed a portable GPS. I selected the NAVRUF primarily because of the 9 inch screen. At First I purchased the Chinese version. That was like someone else indicated, \u201cJUNK\u201d. Then I noticed there was an American Version so I purchased that one, again because of the 9 inch screen. Then I ran into the Problem. \"The new NAVRUF would not let me insert the house number for my destination.\" I fooled around for hours trying to install another map into the GPS, and could not. I was ready to send this one back to Amazon. Then I decided to try one more time to install the house number. I went to the website (it was a CVS), and typed in for the street NAME, exactly the way the STREET NAME appears on the Website. In this case it read \"E Flamingo Rd\" after doing that I was able to install the house number. Now I am living Happily ever After!",
