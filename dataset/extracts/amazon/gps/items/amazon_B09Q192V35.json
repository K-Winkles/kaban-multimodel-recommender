HOWEVER, 2 of the batteries show just ONE BAR out of four, 2 others show just TWO BARS out of four, 1 shows THREE BARS out of four, with the sixth battery showing a full FOUR BARS, which in reality means anywhere from 100% to about 75% of energy. CRUD!I called Amazon regarding this, expecting that this PLUS MEMBER would just have six CR2032 Lithium batteries (about ten bucks for Duracell type) sent at no charge. But NO! Amazon wants this70+ \"Old-fart\" to get the walker out (bad legs/hips/back) and take the devices to the UPS store for sending back and get a replacement set.Y'all have a good day.Michel J. GaudetUPDATE UPDATE UPDATEGuess what? I also let the company, Deeliuerr, know about the battery issue, and they sent me six more of the drvices. If I am lucky, one of the six CR2032 LiIon batteries might have a near 100% charge. That will give me a total of TWO batteries that show four bars of charge. lolSo, thanks Deeliuerr, and a big ol' raspberry :-\u00de~ to Amazon for being too d@mn cheap to just send me some CR2032 batteries.Michel",

Poorly translated. So it's confusing to use. Even in it's native Chinese, it lacks a lot: usability, options, information. Cheaper options end up costing a lot. This is a very cheap product.",
