The GPS Antenna measures 1-3/8\" x 1-7/8\" and can be installed anywhere on the vehicle with a clear line of sight to the sky such as the roof, dashboard or on top of the trunk. Going through any enclosed areas such as tunnels or garages will obstruct and drop the signal until the antenna is clear once again.

The pulse output is around 8k, I am using an intellitronix digital cluster I bought years back. Stock setting is 8k for input, I didn't have to adjust a thing! Their customer support is quick to reply. That sold me as well. Price, size, ease of install and compatibility! Perfect!!!",
