                "reviewText": "I just purchased the unit from Amazon a couple of weeks ago, I use it so my wife can track my movements when I take my motorcycle for a ride. With the colder weather limiting my time out, I've only tested it a few times so far, but very happy with the accuracy and the battery life. I've had mine on the performance mode (the fastest when moving at 5 sec pings) and it's done very well for me. I will update this at some point when I've tested it more, but overall the unit was priced well on Amazon, but keep in mind you do need to purchase a monthly or yearly subscription to begin tracking with the device. For me, the cost is worth the peace of mind my wife has so she can keep an eye out for me on those long rides and hopefully I'll never need it to find me if something bad should happen but at least it gives her the knowledge of where I am and where I've been. The magnet is SUPER strong so no worries there, but it even has 2 areas where you can apply a zip tie as a backup if you like. I haven't tested it out in very dense areas yet where cell phone reception is limited, but again, will update when I can test all aspects of the unit. Can't say anything with regard to tech support either since I've had no problems thus far. In any case, if what I've said is in any way helpful to you, and you are looking for a good tracker for whatever reason, I can highly recommend this one! Thanks, fellow riders be safe out there! :)",

While it's not expensive, it may be a drawback for some people who are on a tight budget. ($32.61 a month)Limited features: The Spytec GPS GL300 has limited features compared to other GPS trackers. It's great for tracking the location of your belongings, but it doesn't have additional features such as geofencing or alerts.Can be slow to update: Sometimes, the Spytec GPS GL300 can be slow to update its location, especially when it's in areas with poor network coverage.Requires a data connection: The Spytec GPS GL300 requires a data connection to work, which may be a drawback if you're in an area with poor network coverage or don't have access to data.Overall, I would recommend the Spytec GPS GL300 to anyone who needs a reliable and discreet GPS tracker for their belongings.

I strongly recommend you buy the magnet case with them.",

                "reviewText": "I was worried about my area not having good reception but it worked perfect. I'm a computer boomer and it was super simple to set up and use. The app makes everything easy and the product works amazing. Place under the steering wheel well and the magnetic box is rock solid, makes no noise. The battery lasts about a week or so, the app has satellite view which is helpful customer service is A+ but the only complaint I have is they don't make it clear that they keep charging your card every month until you contact them and ask them to stop. But once emailed they turned off. Son has permit and it's all ready for when he gets his license. I've seen a case recently where a young teen was found like a week later in a lake and if her parents had a tracker hidden in her car, they would of known exactly where the car was. Can't put a price on this item and their service. Plus even for the safety of mind of your vehicle, especially if you have a classic car or 80s-90s JDM car that's an easy target for thieves. They even make a hard wire kit to go to your battery or you can buy one that goes under your hood. This is much better than one that goes in OBD2 port as thieves will immediately know that's there and throw it. Can hide in trunk, under seat, I can't say enough great things about this service and product and their customer service.",
