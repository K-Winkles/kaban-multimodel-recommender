                "reviewText": "THE GOOD: Does everything you'd want from a GPS watch. I had an old Garmin that was clunky and odd shaped, but this is more like a real watch (albeit a bit thicker). It's easy to use and it's easy to upload your data to the Garmin web site to track your activities. You can also download your activity in a GPX or TCX format so you can upload it to other sites like Runkeeper, which I have used for years. The Garmin site is very similar and I may switch to it eventually, but old habits are hard to break (plus I have 6 years of data on Runkeeper).THE BAD: A little slow to acquire GPS...maybe 30 seconds to a minute. Runkeeper on my Android phone acquires them instantly.",

Since he is 15 and loses everything, I didn't want to spend a lot of money for a running watch, but this was the year he really seemed to want to work to improve his time. This watch seems to find a signal pretty quickly, and is easy to use. When using as a watch without the GPS function, it can go about a week without a charge. We received the watch, as well as the charger with our purchase, and everything seems to work as if it was new.",

Controls aren't initially intuitive but I expect they will be with repitition.Thought at first the size would bother me. Much larger than my simple wrist stopwatch but that hasn't been a problem.",

                "reviewText": "Great tool for long runs. Let's me know how long I've been running and how far, avg. mile, keeps track of my 1 mile splits to keep me on target. Does exactly what I need it to do and is much better than trying to do the same with an app through a phone that is stuck to your arm. I've run 4 hours and 40 mins with this and the battery didn't even start to blink that it was getting low. So, the battery life on this is great too...just make sure it's fully charged before you leave. I made the mistake of thinking I could just waltz out the door without having it fully charged since my previous run wasn't that long, but I didn't take into consideration the fact that the battery is still running when it sits on the shelf, just keeping time. So, I had to cut my run short. Otherwise, this thing goes and goes. :)",

Battery life is okay, must remember to fully charge prior to a long run. Would estimate a full charge gives about 3-4 hours so probably not a good choice for marathons. I use the virtual pace function so battery may last longer if this function turned off.",
