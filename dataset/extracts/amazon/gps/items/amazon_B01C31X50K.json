                "reviewText": "I needed a device for peace of mind to help track family while they are on their daily walks. This device works perfectly for those needs.Comparison to google maps location sharing: giving Google maps a shot made the most sense. Free, existing technology. However, it\u2019s also terribly unreliable. There are huge gaps in time (hours) when the app might refresh to give an accurate location.Comparison to Jiobit, the new competitor with lots of marketing hype behind it: I like the design but that is just about all. It has curved edges and has the shape of car key alarm that would fit neatly into the palm of your hand.They have LOTS of positive testimonials from both tech and parent reviewers. BUT do yourself a favor and read the fine print from actual buyers. A lot of people complained in particular about the billing.The Jiobit subscription appears to be permanent, as in forever! You cannot cancel independently; you have to do so via email. And when you do, your device will stop working entirely, no chance of signing back on at a later date. Goodbye $130. The only way to keep using your device to keep paying for it.That\u2019s when I changed my keyword search to something more simple, \u201cGPS tracking device.\u201c There are a lot of results that pop up. Plenty of them are very old-school, clunky, ugly-looking, outdated technologies. Among them, you\u2019ll also see very odd pricing structures... for example, if you want to see more frequent/accurate location updates, you have to pay more, up to $30-40+ monthly.After doing a lot of sifting, I settled on the Optimus tracker. No regrets at all.Pros:\u2022 Not a bad looking device. Very simple. Has a couple LED lights to let you know it\u2019s working or charging.\u2022 Excellent battery life - in my case, it will run for a week before going to about 50%.\u2022 Has web based map as well as app based.\u2022 Mobile phone app is simple, intuitive, and well designed.\u2022 App will allow the creation of multiple Geo fences.\u2022 App has the ability to send text notifications to multiple phone numbers.\u2022 Device and app will allow you to choose the frequency of the location updates ranging from 10 minutes all the way down to 10 seconds\u2026 At no extra cost. (Although, the battery will drain faster at the smaller intervals.)\u2022 Cancel any time you want! Restart your subscription anytime you want. $19/month at the time of this review.\u2022 The price of the product is less than a quarter of what people are paying to get ripped off by Jiobit.If I had any wishes, it might be that the device was a little bit smaller. As it is, it has the appearance and size of a tiny remote control. But given all of the advantages mentioned above, that\u2019stotally fine.I would recommend this!",

I hid it in our car and even though he thought I had one he never found it. The battery last extremely well and the app tells you the amount of battery left on your device. Also when it comes time to plug it up to charge it doesn't take long at all. It's affordable and I've had no problems with the app.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Easy to use, does the trick",
                "reviewText": "I bought one of these to keep track of a vehicle. Didn't use it at first, and set it aside. When I went to use it, I had lost the directions, so I emailed the company -- they emailed me back within the hour -- pretty impressive. It's simple to set up! For a totally honest review, here are all my thoughts: The tracker works well, although not exact, but that is to be expected, really. It gives you a general enough idea of where the vehicle is that you can figure it out. The movement alert is pretty touchy -- goes off a LOT, maybe even if there is wind, so, when the vehicle isn't in use, I just turn the movement alert off. I also bought the magnetic case to attach the tracker to the underside of the vehicle, and it works great! As for battery life, I noticed some complaints about it being too short -- I find it lasts about 2 weeks, as promised. If you keep every alert on \"on\" all the time, that may wear it out faster, but I really don't find it to be an issue. And it's easy. I like it so well that I ordered a 2nd one, for another vehicle. And you can name them yourself, to make it easy to differentiate between them, if you have more than one. Now, I will compare it to Verizon's hum, which I also own. The hum is much more specific on location, and has live coverage -- meaning I can actually watch the vehicle travel (on the hum map). The Optimus tracker is not live -- but you just have to keep pressing the \"refresh\" icon, and you can follow along that way. But I definitely prefer the Optimus thus far, because the hum OFTEN doesn't work properly -- I would never give the hum a good review, frankly. I've only been using the Optimus tracker for 6 months or so, and definitely recommend it. And their customer service is unparalleled! When is the last time you called a company and got a person on the phone (immediately!) who was kind and helpful? That's the experience I had with the people at Optimus. I don't write many reviews, but wanted to make sure to do this one because I'm so pleased! :)",

                "reviewText": "Purchased to track one of my teen children. Hid in a panel and wrapped up in a rag. 95% of the time it works like a dream. When moving it updates very accurately. The tracks as to where your vehicle has been show \"as the crow flies\" though. It will not show you a nice neat trail as to exactly which roads you were on, but rather will connect them through areas where there aren't actual roads; no big deal honestly. It is pretty easy to draw accurate conclusions as to what roads the vehicle was actually on. One day it showed my car was parked about seven houses down. I dove home and my car was sitting in my drive way. It seems to have trouble reporting accurately around my house, but nearly all other areas report correctly and VERY accurately - like within just a few feet of where the car actually is. Have used about five days and have 62% battery left. It will probably last me about two weeks on one charge is my best guess. I actually love this tracker and am considering buying a second one. The phone app works well; logging into the website on my laptop does also. Very few issues except for the false reporting around my house. At the very least I know my car is probably parked at my house, but is showing a few houses down... I can live with that if that's the worst issue I encounter with this unit. $100 well spent.",
