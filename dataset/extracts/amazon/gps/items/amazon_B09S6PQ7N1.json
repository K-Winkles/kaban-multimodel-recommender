I use it on our 30 pound dog instead.**Rubber/silicone cover - the part that holds it to the collar - gets worn out and breaks quickly, so order extras if you order a tracker. HOWEVER, DO NOT order them from Amazon, order directly from Tractive. They are cheaper AND arrive in 10 to 12 days instead of the 6 to 8 weeks that Amazon says. There is no special \"international shipping fee\" either. Amazon says it waives this fee for you, but it doesn't exist if ordered from Tractive directly. It ships from Seattle instead of the UK, where Amazon is contracted to order it from in order to overcharge customers.",
