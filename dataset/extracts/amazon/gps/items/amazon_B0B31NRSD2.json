Even though the return window may have already closed, the seller made things right. As for the product\u2019s capability, if the device gets a clear view to the sky it is fairly accurate with most of its readings within a few yards. Once in a while you might get an outlier but if you normalize the data it\u2019s easily worked around.

Reports USB device info as follows: idVendor = 0x1546 (U-Blox) idProduct = 0x01a7 (U-blox 7)which is then claimed by low-level ACM driver cdc_acm and shows up as /dev/ttyACMn, 9600 bps, 8N1. And at that point it's \"just another GPS\", and you can have fun with whatever userland utilities you like to configure and/or just gobble GNSS sentences (binary or NMEA, take your pick, U-Blox 7 supports both options.)Observed self-ID sentences immediately after power-up: $GPTXT,01,01,02,ANTSTATUS=OK*3B $GPTXT,01,01,02,u-blox ag - www.u-blox.com*50 $GPTXT,01,01,02,HW UBX-G70xx 00070000 FF7FFFFFo*69 $GPTXT,01,01,02,ROM CORE 1.00 (59842) Jun 27 2012 17:43:52*59 $GPTXT,01,01,02,PROTVER 14.00*1E $GPTXT,01,01,02,ANTSUPERV=AC SD PDoS SR*20The very bottom line on the label of the units I received is 2311, probably a date code (i.e. November 2023) but not sure that's right.
