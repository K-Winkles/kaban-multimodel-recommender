                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Affordable and reliable satellite communication",
                "reviewText": "Pros:* Affordable (I am on a 20 message plan + automatic sharing plan for $26 a month)* Plus during offseason you can suspend the service for $4 a month.* Reliable and works even in partly cloudy days and partially covered with forestry* Battery lasts a long time. after using this for 2 days it went from fully charged to 77%* Excellent tech support* Automatic location sharing works flawlesslyCons:* App is not real intuitive to use* Setup is somewhat confusing I had a hard time setting up contacts plus the payment is only done through their website and everything else is done via the app.While solo riding can be quite a enjoyable activity there is the problem of getting help. Especially if you are in a remote area with no cellphone coverage. To resolve this problem I tried out the Zoleo Satellite Communicator. Overall it works really well but setting it up was a bit challenging and the app is not real user friendly. I had to contact tech support several times and they were quick and helpful.From trial and error I find that the best way to mount the device is with their proprietary mount and it has to be out in the open. Before I had this in my tank bag but found that it can't communicate with satellites due to interference. Attached is a picture of the mount on my motorcycle. As you can see I have a front brake RAM mount attached and then a small arm which holds the zoleo mount. Through this mount it works 100% of the time and can share my location reliably.One really cool feature is that it can share your location automatically with your contacts. I have family and they want to at least know where I am in case I need help. You can configure it to share your location every 6, 12, 24, etc.. minutes. I use the every 12 minute update feature and found that works well for me.It does have a SOS feature where you can text with worldwide 911 services. Fortunately I've never had to test this. And according to their documentation you don't even need the phone do do a SOS. You can just press the SOS button and someone should head to your location.Conclusion: Recommended as long as you don't mind text-only communication. A great plus is it can automatically share you location to family/friends.",

                "reviewText": "Got to use all the features on the first time out unfortunately. I bought this unit based on some great reviews and had all the features I needed. Ultimately purchased it to communicate with group of snowmobilers during winter rides. I had a break down and was separated on back to back trips this year and wanted a solution. So I took it on a hiking trip over the recent holiday weekend and told a contact (Android phone) once I got up to the camp site, I would send a location pin (IOS phone) and have him guess which location we ended up in in order to test sharing a location and having them find it on their app with offline maps.Just short of the camping spot I ended up breaking my leg. I started texting contacts in my iPhone using the Zoleo device and phone app to find out how far behind the rest of the group was and learned they were about 3 hours behind me. I debated for about 30 minutes about what to do and ultimately ended up pressing the SOS button due to the severity of the injury and remote location.Things I learned from my Zoleo device experience:1. Response time between texts was very good. Even though I was in a real bad spot against steep sloping terrain with very tall trees on all sides......signal was the only problem based on my injury location. However, I believe the longest time for sending or receiving a text was 1-2 minutes but most of the time it was almost instantaneous.2. SOS response was excellent. Once pressed they immediately reached out to my emergency contacts. They were in contact with me within 2 minutes and updated me throughout the ordeal. First communication was \"GEOS: This is the IERCC, what is your emergency?\".3. Once IERCC determined that it was an emergency, they contacted a sheriff's office around 65 miles away (nearest location by checking Google). The sheriff's office then immediately contacted a local volunteer search and rescue crew.4. When the search and rescue crew arrived, they were very professional, prepared, and very good at what they do. Very happy about that part. They immediately said they were pleased that I was able to get a very accurate location and inquired about how I did so. I showed them the Zoleo device and the SOS function and they were super impressed but hadn't heard of it before. They were able to use the location pin sent from my Zoleo device and input it into an onX app on their iPhone's and arrived exactly to my location. So there was no time \"searching\" around and took the guess work of finding me out of the time it took to rescue me.5. At some point I inquired if I had to do any paperwork with them once finished and they said no. So there was no financial liability with these search and rescue folks. However, once we reached my vehicle I wasn't sure what their protocol was and requested that I drive myself out to the hospital of my choice. Their response was that there was too much liability for them to release me and instead drove me to the forest area boundary to be picked up by a waiting ambulance. So at that point I was liable for the cost of the ambulance and an overnight stay at an unknown hospital. Not really a bad thing in the end but I wasn't sure what the financial implications would be by pressing the SOS button......but I know now.Bottom line: I will never go off grid again without my Zoleo device. It was peace of mind when I got injured and the search and rescue crew gave me great feedback on how it helped them do their job to help me. Also, my contact that was sent the location pin instantly knew exactly where I was at as well, which is why I initially purchased it. Hope this helps anyone looking for something similar in a satellite communication device linked to IOS and/or Android phone.------not affiliated in any way with this company or how the device works------",

                "reviewText": "When looking to buy a satellite communicator I had narrowed the choice down to two devices. The other wasn\u2019t in stock and so that made my final decision, and I\u2019m glad it did.The device was easy to set up on my phone, and I let one or two loved ones know to download the matching app on their phone so I could use that to send them messages (they can receive them as normal text messages, bits it's a bit smoother and easier if you both have the dedicated app). I had opted for the basic satellite plan giving a limited number of messages that could be sent, and also opted for the \u201clocation share plus\u201d addon which meant I could send an unlimited number of location markers and \u201cI\u2019m OK\u201d messages with family.The best praise I could give the Zoleo is that I\u2019m happy to say it did everything just as it was expected to do, with no hassle or drama.I tested it by sending a few messages through the Zoleo app as I was in the car traveling to the area I would be camping in, and then again along the first part of the trail. All of these were \u201cfree\u201d as I was still within mobile network coverage so they just sent through the normal mobile network and didn't count towards the subscription plan, but it was handy to have them within the Zoleo app anyway so it could be one complete conversation during the trip rather than jumping between different apps.Once on the trail I was able to turn on the location markers. While each marker would normally use up one of your allocated satellite messages, as I had purchased the location share plus bundle they were also \u201cfree\u201d, and so I set it to broadcast my location every 12 minutes. As this was a solo trip and I was on my own a fair distance from civilisation, my partner found it very reassuring being able to track my progress and see that I was OK, and follow my path on the map each time it sent my location to her.Once I got to my camping location I was able to send/receive a few messages to let people know I was safe and well and say goodnight, this time by satellite as I was well out of network coverage now, and they sent just like any other message, with no issue.My only slight gripe was that I found I used the battery quicker than expected, by the end of the first day I was down around half way with the battery. However I am sure this was because I had all of the settings turned up full, with it \u201calways\u201d checking for satellite messages and broadcasting my location every 12 mins. If I had dialled these back a little I\u2019m sure it would have lasted a lot longer and I would be able to use it on a more extended trip without having to recharge.Overall the Zoleo performed great. I note below that some older reviews seem to complain about undelivered messages or things not working reliably, but the company seem to have ironed out any bugs they were having in the past and it worked flawlessly for me.It\u2019ll now just be a standard part of my kit for any trips I\u2019m going on, whether that is specifically \u201coutdoors\u201d trips, or even just more traditional holidays or work trips, just to make sure I always have a way to contact people even if I\u2019m in a place with less than reliable mobile network coverage.",
