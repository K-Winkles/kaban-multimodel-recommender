                "reviewText": "Update July 18: I've started wearing the 45s for sleep. It does indeed show REM. It doesn't offer pulse ox. The 45s works great with my Scosche Rhythm+ heart rate monitor. As is typical with wrist-based HRMs, I have to move the 45s higher on my arm and tighten it a bit during workouts where I'm swinging my arms. I find it easier to use the Rhythm+ during activity since I already owned it. Firmware update 2.60 didn't fix the notification issue I reported in my initial review, but Garmin support is working on it and will notify me when a fix is released. I do wish there were more band colors available for the 45s. I'm increasing my rating from 4 stars to 5. This is a great watch!Original review:I'm not a runner. I'm a walker with health issues, so I wanted something to track activity, training walks, sleep, etc. I left Fitbit (after owning almost every device since the original), as I got tired of not being able to share my Fitbit data with Apple Health and other health/fitness apps. Even though Fitbit advertises the ability to share data with Withings, One Drop, Cardiogram, etc., data doesn't import consistently, accurately or completely. Anyway, the Apple watch series 4 didn't work for me, as I had to charge it every night. So I started looking at the new Garmin devices.I did own a Forerunner 235 briefly a couple years ago, but it was so big on my small wrist and way overkill for my needs that I moved it along. I picked up the new Vivosmart 4, and it's a nice, small device that tracks steps accurately, but it has no GPS (or even connected GPS). It does have fantastic sleep tracking with an SpO2 sensor! Next I tried the Forerunner 45s. Unfortunately it doesn't use the SpO2 sensor, so there's no pulse ox.I've always preferred black or grey watches, so my choice of white or what looks like purple (in the pics) but is actually blue, was disappointing. I debated about getting the larger 45, but in the end I decided on white. It's nice looking, and the white silicone strap cleans up well in warm water and a mild facial cleanser. It's got everything I want except the SpO2 sensor that Vivosmart 4, Forerunner 245 and up have. Currently I'm wearing the Vivosmart 4 for sleep and the Forerunner 45s for daily wear and workouts.I was hesitant to buy the 45s after reading about connectivity issues. I had those issues too at first. It was extremely frustrating downloading the firmware update when the watch wouldn't stay connected to my phone. But once I got the firmware updated, the watch has stayed connected without issue (iPhone Xs). It's the original firmware that's the problem, not the watch!The one thing that does really bug me (and that Garmin will likely fix in future updates) is that even when I turn notifications off, I still get ALL notifications sent to my phone! The 45s has a choice of all notifications, calls and texts, calls or off. Further, notifications have to be cleared individually. I can find no \"clear all\" option. I finally got rid of notifications by removing the notifications widget. I would really like to get just calls and texts. I just updated to firmware 2.60 that installed quickly. Let's hope this fixes the notifications issue!I've done one walk, and the 45s worked great. I just paired my Rhythm+ heart rate monitor, so I'll try that on my next walk. I'll expand this review as I use the 45s.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this watch to replace a Garmin Forerunner 35 that I had for years as it was on it's last legs. I found this watch to be easy to add to the Gamin Connect app so I could seamlessly keep using that for my workouts and other data. I especially like the GPS feature so I can just go for a run anywhere I want and I know how far I have gone. This eliminates the need to carry my phone or repeatedly run the same pre measured routes. This Forerunner 45 is about the least expensive sports watch I could find that had the built in GPS. I find the distance tracking to be quite accurate based on using it on known routes that had distance measured previously.The battery life is excellent and it can go for a number of days without recharging. However, one of the minor issues I have with this watch over the 35 is that I have to take it off to charge it as the charger plugs into the back. With the 35, the charger kind of clipped on the side so I could continue wearing it while charging. I typically charged it when working by simply plugging it into my laptop.The Forerunner 45 was also easy to pair with my phone and gives me notifications for emails, texts, incoming calls, etc. However, I do find the display on this watch a bit harder to read than the 35. There is more info to see and the text is smaller on this watch. But, I am on the older side, so any younger users with better eyesight may not have any issues with this.Overall, this is an excellent, basic, fitness and smart watch. And with the built in GPS at this price level, it can't be beat.",
