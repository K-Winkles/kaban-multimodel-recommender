                "reviewText": "I mounted this unit on the rear deck and turned on the Humminbird 798 hd si. All I can say is wow....Now the chart is easy to navigate, and I am certain as to which way the craft is heading. It's worth owning. An external antenna is the only way to go.Mounting is simple I secured mine to the rear deck behind my seat. Mounting is not critical, as the satellites are able to see the antenna from several hundred miles above you....It's not like they can't see over your shoulder.",

Mounted it on a $25 Ram D VHF antenna mount (perfect thread match) about 18\u201d in front of the motor on my bass boat. No interference problems. Am using it with the Solix Live Chart function to map the bottom of a historically significant bay in my area. Allows me to run parallel track with close spacing to insure full bottom coverage of my DI and SI collections.",
