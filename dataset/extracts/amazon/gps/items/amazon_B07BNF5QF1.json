                "reviewText": "The description does not indicate anything about using a 2G Sim card. When I receive the product, the instructions are that it must use a 2G Sim card. But I had already bought a 4G Sim card for the device. The 4G Sim card does not work in this device. Since 2G is being phased out this, GPS Tracker will probably work for you for a little while but it\u2019s not what I was looking for. Although it did behind my phone when I did the 000 and it did give me a response on 777, it was in Chinese, and indicated to the translation that link could not be created.",
