I just got it and used at my country club, which was good to know they had that course. The magnet to secure to the cart is awesome....very strong, no worries it will come off cart. It has a great sound with decent bass tones to play your tunes, and when you want to quickly check distance to center, simply press the remote control button and it will call out distance to center of green, as well as distance to any water hazards. I am sure it can do more, but I am the typical guy who just wants to link it up and go. The app was easy to load, and there is no cost associated with the app (at least as far as I can tell now). If you are looking for a nice cart speaker with a GPS feature, look no further. This unit is very cool, and very reasonably priced. Simple functions (on/off, volume) make this practical, simple to use and just a fun go to. I will use this all the time now, but remember to take it off the cart when you are done! I actually left mine ono the cart and realized I left it there when I was making a quick call to the wife when leaving the club. My audio was still connected to the Wingman, so I ran back and grabbed it. Much like cigar holders, it could be easy to forget.....",

                "reviewText": "Overall, this is a phenomenal Speaker and Range-Finder for a mediocre fast-past golfer.I am a Bogey golfer and love to play and keep track of my scores, the app is great and helps me better keep track of my rounds and how I play each hole. It compiles my states from all of the rounds I enter and gives me all kinds of data about my performance like my par percentage when my tee shots lands in the fairway vs. when I'm in the left or right rough. It also tracks my 2-putts and where my scores tend to fall when I 1, 2 or 3 putt.The range finder gives me accurate distances to the center of the green (+/- 5 yards) which is tight enough for my golf skills and it is fast so I can press the range button and it gives me my range as I'm picking my club which helps increase the speed of play. I still use my handheld range finder for shots onto the green so I know my distance to the flag and to cover the front edge of the green.I use this speaker/range finder every round, just like my golf shoes.",

                "reviewText": "I received this for my birthday from my family. I was really excited about this. It is loud, and pretty accurate as far as announcing yardage. The only 1 1/2 negatives that I have:- Sound is very trebley with little bass- Even though it has a strong magnet on it, I still strap it down because depending on who is driving the cart, and what you are driving through, it could bounce off. This really is a suggestion opposed to a negative. The magnet is pretty strong.I would give it 4 1/2 stars just because of the low bass. I would absolutely recommend this speaker for golf though.",

                "reviewText": "Sound quality in this thing is amazing. Absolutely incredible. Bass is outstanding and the clarity is better than any bluetooth speaker I've ever heard. This would be well worth the $150 if you just wanted a high end speaker. The range finder is almost like a bonus. However, that bonus works really well. I read some reviews that had complaints, but mine has been superb. Really nice to push a button and instantly get distances of green edges, the pin, and hazards.On the other hand, the neoprene bag is not worth $10. If I did it again I would just get the speaker and maybe look for one of the hard shell cases that are like $15. The bag is not designed for the speaker, it just happens to fit. It's adequate quality-wise but does not do justice to such a high-end speaker. I bet with a little digging one could find a great case for cheap, but the bag in this deal is not the answer.",
