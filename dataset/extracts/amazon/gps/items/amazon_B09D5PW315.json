All too often I get a call right in the middle of driving somewhere right when I really need the directions! Also, I've had my share of freezes and app issues that needed rebooting the phone. Not helpful! I also like to have redundancy when I travel, so I've always had a GPS type unit and also my smart phone ( for as long as you could do that with a phone). In any case, I love the sheer size of the screen. That feature alone helps to determine where an upcoming turn is located. I like being able to see more of the surrounding area on the Garmin screen than I can with the small (by comparison) phone's screen. The DriveSmart 86 has a whole host of other features that you would expect. The features I really like are the large screen and the volume of the unit itself. I find it's very easy to hear as well as see! I found it very capable. It locates addresses quickly and gives voice prompts in a timely manner. I'm very pleased with my new Garmin!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Nice bright display, responsive touch screen, fast routing",
                "reviewText": "I got this to upgrade my very old Nuvi model. On those old GPS displays, the touch screen is SO frustrating and you have to really press and wait for it to recognize each tap. The old one was also frustratingly slow to recalculate the route if I detoured for something like a rest area or exit to get gas. The voice saying \"Recalculating\" becomes a running joke on long road trips.So, enough about the old one... the new Garmin models have a much more responsive touch screen just like cell phones. The processor in there is a lot faster to recalculate if you're doing a detour (and without the annoying voice telling you about it). It also supports extra nav systems besides GPS which seems to help it be even more accurate (with 10 feet is usually what I got). The old one would sometimes lose signals in valleys or downtown between buildings and might show me a hundred feet away, but this model does a great job of showing where I really am.The voice navigation is amazing. It was so cumbersome to type in addresses on the old one but with the nice touchscreen, that's a breeze, but what I really loved was being able to say \"Okay Garmin, go to Walgreens\" or something and then pick which one I wanted to go to from the list. I don't know how thorough the database of locations is, but on my recent 3500 mile road trip, I rarely asked it for something it couldn't look up. Fast food and gas stations are just fine, I even asked it to go to a Verizon store when we needed a new phone and it pulled up the nearby locations.My one gripe is probably about the connectivity to my Android phone. The Garmin Drive app works, but the GPS keeps wanting to change the volume of my phone on its own. I also connect to my car radio over bluetooth to play music, and I've setup the Drive app and GPS appropriately for that case, but it seems like when the GPS connects it wants to lower the volume of my phone (and thus how loud it plays music to the car stereo). I can turn it back up, but that only lasts until the next time I get going again. Very weird.I also had problems where the GPS would keep showing \"Galaxy S8+ disconnected\" over and over. I think that was the power savings on my old phone putting the Drive app to sleep... maybe? I disabled it from being able to sleep, but I haven't driven long enough after that to see if it helped, and then I updated to a newer phone anyway so the jury is still out on whether that's still an issue. That doesn't concern me too much because when I'm driving, I don't really need the GPS linked to my phone although, if I understand correctly, it can get data through that phone connection for even minor things like weather updates or road conditions that maybe the traffic data doesn't get? Or using that tether for software updates too if I'm not within range of my wifi (which really only happens when it's parked in the garage anyway).Overall I'm very happy I splurged for the update. I miss my old Nuvi 1390's ability to connect to the ecoroute module plugged into the OBDII port so I could see the real time gauges right there on the GPS, but I do have a bluetooth dongle for OBD that I can use to see that on my phone. It was just handy because I'd use that whole ecoroute stuff on the GPS to keep track of my gas usage between fillups and it would show my MPG. I got an app for that now, it just means manually putting in my mileage instead of having the GPS already know that. It'd be cool if Garmin added a gas tracker app directly on the GPS... shouldn't be that hard?",

                "reviewText": "This is the 3rd Garmin I\u2019ve owned the previous was a NUVI. It worked well until the battery failed as well as the power supply connection.The DriveCam 76 was fairly easy to set up, but I was not able to complete the registration via WiFi as the screen froze as I attempted to enter my email address. I completed via a computer connection. I was concerned about the WiFi feature and the necessary speed so I contacted Garmin. I was told \u2018 as long as you have wifi 2.4 Ghz/ second it will download\u2019.( thats 2400 MB ). Who has that kind of speed? I don\u2019t. I have 25 MB/ second up and down and the software and map update downloaded just fine.Surely all those talented engineers at Garmin could have developed a better mounting system than this. Firstly, it intrusive to field of view. The DriveCam takes up space, then the suction cup to the windshield is another blocking device. Theft is always a concern, as noted in the DriveCam manual. It\u2019s recommended that the GPS and mount be removed when not in use. This is no simple task as suction is strong to the windshield and difficult to break. The power button is tiny and difficult to find by touch. It\u2019s about 1/3 the size of the NUVI.Garmin needs to develop a better mounting device for the DriveCam 76.",
