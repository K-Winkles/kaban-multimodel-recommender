        "description": "Positioned as the top-tier model in the Garmin line, the Tacx Neo 2T Smart Trainer is among our top picks for its wide range of axle compatibility and quiet design. It has ANT+ Cycling Dynamics in the firmware, allowing us to use the pedal stroke analysis feature with third party software such as Garmin Edge computers, making it easier than ever to monitor output. The latest design makes the trainer more responsive to speed and incline changes, with dynamic inertia quickly compensating for weight, speed, and incline changes to ensure the most realistic ride feel possible. A few more relevant details help distinguish the Neo 2T from other trainers. Its max power is 2,200 watts, it measures watts to a claimed 1% accuracy, and it simulates inclines up to 25%. Please note that some disc brake frames may have clearance issues on the Neo 2T Smart. A spacer is available directly through Garmin, if needed.",

                "reviewText": "Came from a Kurt Kinetic Rock n Roll smart trainer, got a new bike w thru axle, so it wouldn\u2019t really work. Thought I\u2019d miss the movement. The Tacx flexes enough side to side to make it comfortable enough. The HUGE benefit is that I can upload my normal outside rides from Garmin connect and the trainer will replicate them almost perfectly. I ride in central PA with a lot of hills, so have always struggled to create a winter program that will have me ready to go out when the snow is gone. The trainer (with the paid app-but it\u2019s worth it for me) gets the load on grades right (I\u2019m in the same gears, roughly same cadence, same watts-per my power meter pedals), and the subjective effort is pretty close. That\u2019s just using the GPS ride function. It\u2019s nice to also be able to use it with the app (or I\u2019m sure any third-party app) to do video rides as well. The ones I\u2019ve done do a good job with grades, etc.Trainer seems durable, no glitches yet with about 3K miles on it so far. Glad I took the plunge. Getting out this winter/spring has been the easiest ever. Power measured by the trainer matches pretty close to my power meter pedals, too. Cadence is totally unreliable, though.",

I have some basic tools for my bikes, but setting this one up will require a whole more that I wasn't willing to purchase. Especially the installation of the cassette (which you need to purchase separately!) is very tricky. I had to get a friend to help me and we finally mounted my bike, but now there is some rubbing going on. We had take everything off again and put some spacer in, but I will still need to pay a mobile mechanic to come out and figure out where the rubbing is coming from. This is not an easy set-up and I am even contemplating selling that trainer again, I cannot image what it takes to get my bike off this thing and fit for riding on the road again.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, this is a great trainer but the post purchase support could be a lot better. I\u2019ve been using it for about 4 months. It has a solid design and provides a wonderful \u201csense of the road\u201d. When connected to a training application (Rouvy, Tacx, Zwift) you\u2019ll feel the hills, bumpy roads (not in your butt but through the pedals) and even a nice simulation on downhill segments. It\u2019s extremely stable \u2013 I\u2019m set up on a carpet and I\u2019m very comfortable even when standing on the pedals pushing up a steep climb. What annoyed me is the lack of support getting the thing up and running. I\u2019m not a bike mechanic and most of my tools are not metric. The machine doesn\u2019t come with a cassette (you\u2019ve probably already figured that out). This means you\u2019ll have to figure out which one to purchase, order the specialized tools and then install the darn thing. I watched a bunch of videos and finally got it on correctly after 3 tries and a considerable amount of profanity. Then there\u2019s the axle setup. I have a solid \u201cthru axle\u201d on my Trek Domane \u2013 my trainer shipped with a quick release set up. To its credit, the Garmin Tacx Neo 2T comes with a bunch of adapters supporting a thru axle conversion. Unfortunately there\u2019s absolutely no comprehensible explanation as to how it all goes together or what it should look like when you\u2019re done. I was constantly swapping out parts to find the correct combination to fit my bike and allow enough clearance to avoid damage to the disc brakes. You\u2019ll also need a 17mm wrench to tighten the connections. The profanity was bad with the cassette install \u2013 with the axle conversion I was \u201coff the chain\u201d. But bottom line \u2013 it\u2019s a great trainer and I\u2019m loving my indoor winter riding. However, you might want to friend a bike mechanic on Facebook.",

                "reviewText": "This is just an amazing trainer. I haven't used trainers (other than the stationary bikes in the gym) and this year decided to ride hard over winter to prep for next year. I got myself a Zwift account and picked up this trainer. It took me a few minutes to figure out how to attach my bike, but literally everything else was super simple. I mean, I have never changed a cassette before - total newb - and this set up was easy. Of course you'll have to buy a cassette, but I simply bought one that matched my bike.Once the bike was attached - literally the hardest part and probably because I have never done anything like this - I powered on the trainer, it connected to my laptop and away I went. Super easy.The feel of the virtual flywheel is perfect. Great ride. Quiet. Felt stable. And the tactile sensation of cobbles and boardwalk and dirt just blew me away. It's going to be a very cool winter. Highly recommended.",
