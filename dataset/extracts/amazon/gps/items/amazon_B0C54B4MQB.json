And there is no Tech Support for this model tag at all! Ended up tossing out and buying an apple air-tag instead. We would not buy another at all.",

                "reviewText": "Pros: Super easy setup, works great.Cons: Horrible battery life.SETUP: Hold the button on the Tracker down for a few seconds and open the Apple \u201cFind My\u201d app. Tap \u201cItems\u201d then tap the \u201c+\u201d. Tap \u201cAdd Other Item\u201d when it finds your new Tracker name it and tap \u201cContinue\u201d. The \u201cFind My\u201d app will ask for confirmation.. tap continue, then finish and you\u2019re good to go.THE BAD: I bought 2 trackers and started using one as soon as it arrived to track my dog. 10 days later, the battery icon indicated that the battery was low. Maybe this was a fluke, or just cheap batteries. Either way, I replaced batteries in both my trackers with Energizer Lithium batteries. (It doesn\u2019t take C batteries, like in the description says, obviously \u2014 The battery number it takes is 2032). Opening the case takes more than a thumbnail. I used my pocket knife to open them on the only corner that you\u2019re able to.Other than the battery issue, I really like these. If someone jacks any of my stuff, it won\u2019t alert them of its presence. This allows me time to find my item and take the appropriate measures to retrieve it.",

It\u2019s been as much as 30 minutes that I\u2019ve waited for it to update to his location. It also isn\u2019t very specific. It\u2019ll say he\u2019s at the house with us, but he could be on any side of the house or out past the back fence. For a few dollars more I\u2019m just getting name brand next time.",
