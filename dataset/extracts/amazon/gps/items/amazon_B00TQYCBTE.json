It also locks onto GPS satellites faster then the old one.The negatives are that it seems to take far longer to locate traffic information than the 755T did. Also, it requires many more steps to switch between a normal map and a traffic map - traffic map is now accessible only as an app.Finally, a bit of care is required when holding the unit - if you press the screen the wrong way while looking at a map, the unit offers to make the point of your press a new destination, which you usually don't want!Overall, an improvement over my old unit, especially if I intend to consult it while driving.",

The estimated time of arrival is handy as well as the icons for banking, restaurants, etc., along your route. It does not say \"make a u-turn\", make a u-turn\" like the old, old variety of GPS units. It simply plots a new route for you. The traffic automatic re-routing is most helpful. I hate to sit in traffic, so it warns you about traffic conditions and simply finds a better way around them.The big size makes it easier to read and follow my customized little silver coupe along my route. The Help button actually helps out when you don't know how to do something without resorting the the well-written user manual.",

                "reviewText": "This is a re-conditioned unit which seemed fine upon my initial inspection. After some use, the speaker crackles a bit and the mic does not work as well when driving on a highway or interstate. The unit will do many things if you take the time to set it up proerly and learn the functions. There are also numerous youtype widows specifically on this model which are helpful. The screen is large (7\"). Instead of putting it in the center of my front windshield as I did with my previous 5\" unit, I placed it at the top of the window just below the visor on the driver's side. It does not obstruct my view and is easy to use. Rarely do I even need to touch the screen.",
