I would say the seller was accurate in his item description. Howerver...It was not packaged well, just allowed to jostled around the box freely. I would have wrapped the item so it didn't move. I was also missing the mounting clip. I had the arm but not the clip. There wasn't a way for me to get ahold of the seller. I tried asking a question on the app but it said to contact Amazon since they handle shipping. Amazon could not get ahold of the seller without contact info. I thought you had to have that to be a seller...but Amazon gave me $25 credit for my inconvenience of buying another clip separately. Thankfully I found on to fit this garmin but it's a hassle. My husband, a truck driver, will let me know how well the garmin holds up and I'll update this review.",
