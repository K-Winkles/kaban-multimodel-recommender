                "reviewText": "As a photographer, traveler and motorcyclist, I'm always concerned about someone ripping me off! Which led me to look into GPS tracking devices. I looked at the Airtags and some others, but specifically wanted a unit that utilized cellular communications (instead of relying on a walled-garden like Apple's \"Find My\").The \"If It Moves...\" product fits the bill nicely. Although you do need to fully charge it out of the box, it comes with a pre-installed SIM card, an easy-to-use mobile app for iOS and Android (I use an iPhone), and a decent quick-start guide. Once the app is linked to the device and you've clicked one button to put it in Secure mode, you get notifications if it moves, and can see the device on a live map.Physically, this thing is a beast - and that's a good thing! The integrated metal loops let me easily lock it to things I care about. It's small enough to hide, but I think it also doubles as a Theft Deterrent. The blinking lights send the message that it's ACTIVELY in protection mode.I've had it for less than a week, but am pretty pleased with the purchase and the six-month free subscription is a nice bonus - the other ones I was looking at were like 20 bucks a month! This unit cost more upfront, but I\u2019ll be saving money by the time the free subscription ends. Recommended.",
