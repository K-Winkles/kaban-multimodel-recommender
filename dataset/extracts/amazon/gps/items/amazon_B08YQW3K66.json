It's nice not having to reach for a rangefinder on everything hole/shot. Everything is at your fingertips. Super easy to use. Just make sure you put it on your lead hand (the one with the glove) otherwise it won't read when you hit your shot. If you want to take your golf game to the next level I'd recommend this watch.",

                "reviewText": "I have an 8\u201d wrist. Unfortunately this watch, an S42 with the white band, doesn\u2019t fit me. The Amazon website does not mention the fact this watch is for small to medium wrist size. I learned this from the Garmin site. If you have a wrist larger than 176mm order the black version S42. It fits wrist up to 202mm.Amazon needs to update their website\u2019s product description to reflect this information.",

I enjoy the interface and it does exactly what i need it to do when I'm connected to Garmin Golf and Garmin connect.My issue is with the portable charger that came with this bundle. It stopped functioning (won't charge) and apparently i can't return/replace/get any service on it since I received it on July 20 and it is now August 21 (past 30 days?). What a waste!!! I am very disappointed.",

I have had to uninstall and reinstall several times to get score and other stats to update to the app. Bluetooth is a pretty old and reliable tech. its disappointing this works so poorly. If you're not that interested in keeping your stats it's great. During the round it gives good info. If you want your stats on your phone for review or your handicap. It's a royal pain to get it to update to the app.",
