The radio seems to be very good and features like texting and position sharing make it a great product. The GPS side of the unit seems to be outdated and the same software is used on much older models. Don't expect any maps. On the other hand if all you need is marking waypoints and getting you back out of the woods, which is what I wanted, then it does the job. Wish it had replaceable batteries, when your hunting off road for days there's no way to recharge unless you carry a battery pack and again that adds more weight. If this unit had a color screen and replaceable batteries it would be the perfect unit for what I use it for. If you want maps its not for you.",

All other functions have been reduced to a point of uselessness that is ridiculous for the price point. The major disappointment is the lack of uploading additional maps. Meaning your \"tracks\" are in the middle of a blank screen. Your \"friends\" are in the middle of a blank screen. You have no idea of where creeks or roads or how many hills are between you. Just saying this was a CORE function of Rino for 4 generations and this device doesn't have it. If this was priced at say $100-120 it would make some sense, even then it should not carry the Rino branding except to send your location to others with higher models that can actually do something with it. I would not recommend the Rino 700 at this price and cannot comprehend why Garmin released it in this state when it could have had the potential to be so much more.",

Now 5 month later, and after only a handful of uses, the battery has completely failed. The unit operates as normal only when plugged into a power source, but will not charge, effectively crippling its usefulness.***Update Garmin Support was very helpful and offered to replace the unit (still under warranty). I still would never have purchased this item had I realized that the battery is non-replaceable.***",
