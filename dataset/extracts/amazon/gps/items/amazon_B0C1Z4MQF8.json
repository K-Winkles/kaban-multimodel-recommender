                "reviewText": "This is probably the 3rd brand of dash cam I've used over the years. It's a lot more discreet/less bulky than the ones I've had, but that's largely because of the lack of a video screen on the camera itself. At first I was hesitant to get something without a screen, but then I remembered that the screens on my older cameras were a bit of a distraction and weren't as useful as I'd thought they would be because the menu navigation on those cameras was terrible. I just got used to taking the memory card out and viewing it on my computer.This camera is a huge upgrade to what I am used to. Installation was average (can't really get around hiding the cables with any camera). The app is very simple and easy to use. I was able to connect first try with my Android phone, but it took some effort to get my wife's iPhone to connect. I believe the issue was her phone kept automatically connecting to the car's infotainment system even though I would disconnect it and I forgot to turn off mobile data. While the instructions were very simple and straightforward, it seems to be very important to follow them exactly. While my Android phone connected easily without turning off my mobile data, it was necessary to turn it off on my wife's iPhone. Otherwise it wouldn't even detect the camera. After figuring that out, I was able to connect and view all the videos and screenshots with no problem. The customer service while I did troubleshooting was top notch. They were extremely friendly and eager to help get things working right.Overall, this camera is simple, sleek, and has great quality video. I'm very happy with the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "The Redtiger F9N is definitely a great dash cam. Picture quality is fantastic, and I love the minimal design as I really didn't need a screen on my cam to distract me. Installation was very straightforward with adequate length on the cables to accommodate most vehicles. Mine is installed in a 2022 Kia Niro so I had to stash the extra length in the headliner.Here comes the downside, which is why I couldn't give it a perfect 5 star. I was having issues with the app showing the video feed and downloading videos. I thought it was a poor signal connection, but, that actually wasn't the case. The SD Card that comes with the unit is absolute garbage. Once I installed a higher quality SD card, my issues went away for the most part. The other issue is that you can't be connected to the cam and Apple carplay at the same time as the cam creates its own wifi signal to connect your phone to. My car and the cam, were fighting each other to be connected.Overall, great cam with some small drawbacks that hopefully could be addressed.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars High-Tech Dash Cam for Tech-Savvy Users",
                "reviewText": "The REDTIGER F9 4K Dual Dash Cam meets my expectations. It looks great, excellent build quality. It has front and rear cameras that capture everything in high quality, even in the dark. It comes with a 32GB SD card but can store up to 256GB if you need more space.It's small and sleek, so it doesn't take up much space on your windshield. The best part is that it has no screen to distract you while driving. Instead, it has a little red light that flashes when it's recording.However, setting it up can be a bit tricky. You have to use this REDTIGER app to set it all up, and it's not the most user-friendly and intuitive thing. But once you get the hang of it, you can watch live footage and check GPS data from your phone. To connect to the camera, you'll have to do it through the wifi network it creates. Just remember that the password is 12345678.Note that it plugs into the cigarette lighter, but it doesn't come with a kit to set it up properly. So, be aware if your cigarette lighter turns off after turning off your car. Otherwise, if you leave it plugged in too long, it could drain your car battery. The instructions that come with it could definitely use some work - they are written in pretty bad English which makes it hard to follow.One thing I really like is the super-sensitive G-sensor (you can configure the sensitivity on the app). It locks the video if it detects a bump. Also, it can record for 48 hours straight when you're parked, which is great for keeping your car safe. Just get an extra kit for that. It includes a few small adhesive anchors that help you route cables more easily.Customer service? Top-notch. They're always there to help you, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and even give you a one-year warranty.The REDTIGER Dash Cam is a very interesting gadget if you feel like tinkering with the app and installation. It has great features but be prepared for a learning curve to set it up.",

The installation was a breeze, although I did encounter a slight hiccup with the standard power wire being shorter than needed for my Pacifica minivan.However, RedTiger's customer service went above and beyond. A quick call to their support team and they not only addressed the issue promptly but also gracefully provided an extension cord at no extra cost. Clara from their customer service team was an absolute gem\u2014attentive, knowledgeable, and ensured a first-class experience.I purchased two cams for my two cars, and both have exceeded my expectations. The dash cams themselves are top-notch small devices, offering great resolution and reliable performance. But it's RedTiger's commitment to customer satisfaction that truly sets them apart. If you're looking for a quality dash cam backed by exceptional service, the RedTiger cams are the way to go!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this camera based on its features and positive reviews. The front windshield camera was fairly straightforward to install and the included tool made it easy to hide the wire behind the car's trim. I haven't installed the rear facing camera yet, though I plan to, so I can't speak to that. The camera plugs into the cigarette lighter outlet and turns on and off with the car's power. There is a chime to let you know it's engaged.I am happy to report that the dash cam performed perfectly last week when I was involved in a serious collision that resulted in the total loss of my vehicle. I was able to retrieve the camera and the footage that showed that the accident was 100% the other driver\u2019s fault. The video was clear and included all relevant information including speed and location. I'm glad I had turned off the sound recording, as it was a violent head-on collision and just watching the video without sound was distressing.I reached out to the company by email for help with obtaining some replacement parts lost in the crash and they were prompt and extremely helpful. 5 stars!!",
