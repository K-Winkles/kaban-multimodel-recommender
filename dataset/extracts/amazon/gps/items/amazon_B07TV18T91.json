                "reviewText": "Took a chance for just over 10 bucks on Prime Day and happy to report that this antenna works beautifully with any Cobra Dashcam that's compatible with Cobra's Mount/GPS Antenna CA-MOUNT-002, such as models CDR835, CDR855BT, CDR875G, CDR895D, DASH2208, DASH2308, DASH2216D, DASH2316D, CCDC4500 and CCDC4500AUS, plus probably any other Cobra model with a 3.5mm plug. Plenty of cord to reach from the camera mounted just behind the rearview mirror on a full size pickup truck, around the window molding to the top of the dashboard directly in front of the driver. Note that these antennas are designed to face up toward the sky, so don't stick it to your windshield as is. It pinpointed my location even before I opened my garage door to take a test drive. Now all my videos are imprinted with latitude and longitude directly under the date and timestamps, which, by the way are are now synched with GPS satellites. Speed and compass direction are included with your videos, along with your location/route superimposed on a map within the Cobra Drive HD app. Currently, it seems that the Google Maps function doesn't display properly in Windows, but it works with the included Baidu Maps alternative. Hopefully, Cobra will update the Windows Drive HD application soon to fix the Google Maps functionality. If you want to include detailed GPS info to improve the effectiveness of your dashcam videos for insurance claims or police reports, without breaking the bank with a name branded antenna, or an expensive Escort/Passport iRadar subscription, this thing does the trick for next to nothing even when it's not Prime Day!",

                "reviewText": "BingFu brand 3.5mmm audio stereo plug. Works great with my Junsun dashcam GPS. Make sure when you get a GPS antenna if it's Stereo has 2 rings, which this one does. Other GPS use 3.5mmm mono plug (one ring on plug).I made the mistake buying a cheaper (one dollar difference in price), and that cheaper one intermittent GPS and most of the time just didn't work. Played with the plug many times just gave up on it. That bad brand was AtnSincHope this helps anyone in the market for a GPS antenna.",
