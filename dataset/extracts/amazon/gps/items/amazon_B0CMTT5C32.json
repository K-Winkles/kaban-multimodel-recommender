                "reviewText": "I was a little curious as to how a Chinese manufactured GPS system would function, and whether it would be aggravating to use on the roads of Southern New Jersey. I purchased it because of the size of the display and the affordable price, and use it on sales calls during the business week.I have been very pleased with its performance. It has a large, colorful display. The navigation within the GPS is clear and quick. The display always shows the direction vertically, something my old Tom-Tom did not do that occasionally caused confusion when several quick turns were required in succession. The street graphics are clear, road labels are clear and the GPS gives you plenty of warning regarding turns.It also has predictive address entering. By that I mean it will narrow the choices depending on what you enter. So if you enter a township, it will reduce the number of options with each letter you enter. I typically enter only three or four letters for town and street before it pops up the one I am looking for. Saves a lot of time.My only criticism is a relatively minor one. The estimate it provides for the amount of time to reach your destination is sometimes off. Initially it will sometimes overesimate how long the trip will take. It corrects itself as you move closer to your destination, but that can be a little disconcerting at first.Overall, I recommend this GPS for both business and casual travelers.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this item for a elderly man almost 80. I needed something easy to operate as his use and knowledge is limited for electronics. After setting it up and adding his home address I placed the unit in easy mode. I also purchased a hard case so he could leave it in his glove box. I showed him how to use it. Once he turns the unit on it only takes two buttons to get him home. He has a tendency to forget where he's at and how to get home. He used it the other day for the first time and told me the thing talked him all the way home. What an inexpensive investment for allowing someone to keep their independence.",
