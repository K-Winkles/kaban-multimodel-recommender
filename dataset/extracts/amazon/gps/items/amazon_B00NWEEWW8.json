I don't know if it needs a bigger antenna, or what, but I cannot recommend it.Software configuration was okay, and it worked with every piece of software I tried with it. It returned decodable NMEA data correctly showing no lock, so there is that.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a replacement for the Microsoft GPS stick that came with my copy of Streets & Trips 2008; it had worked flawlessly for years through my travels, but once I upgraded to Windows 10...nothing. No driver updates. Nothing at all. It wouldn't read the device. And upgrading my computers to the Anniversary Update turned the Microsoft GPS device into a simple way to cause Blue Screens of Death the moment I plugged it in. \ud83d\ude05 So yeah, I had to get a GPS device that worked with my Windows 10 laptop.This worked golden; thanks to everyone who suggested pre-downloading the drivers before this arrived. Plugged it in, took it outside, and immediately got 3-5 GPS satellites giving me my location in Windows Maps, which is a worthy successor to S&T for me. Works great with Google Earth too, along with MapPoint, despite the older maps. Can't complain about this one; a great device at an excellent price, and exactly what I needed.ETA - Still using it now in 2022 and used it on a trip with my 2019 MacBook Pro, using Parallels running Windows. Plugged this into a USB-C hub, still works like a dream with Windows Maps finding my position headed up the Northeast Regional. It's proved to be just as much of a trip essential over the years.",

It's essentially a UBlox 7 GPS with standard ceramic antenna. Plug it in and install the 500kb driver from Ublox; it creates a virtual com port and you can start using it for your NMEA needs. GPS reception is great, and I have not tried GLONASS. It will not do glonass and gps at the same time (glonass is the russian version of gps, both of which systems have their own satellites). I have read a few articles of people hacking the module inside to pull off a UART signal from 2 of the pins, but they are very tiny pins/pads and that is definitely an advanced type hack/mod. I might try to hack it for use with my arduino or flight controller in the future.If you are <Joe Blow doesn't know anything technical and needs a gps unit>, or even if you are into GPS integration for computers, arduino, RC, etc, then I would recommend this!I would recommend it even if you",

It needed GPS, partly for position, but mostly as a precise time reference for the weak signal modes that require synchronized transmission and reception. There are a few online explanations of how to install this GPS USB dongle, usually for the Raspberry Pi but the process is the same for any other Linux PC. Search for KM4ACK or OH8STN for good YouTube videos and blog posts with step-by-step directions.I was a bit disappointed at first because the GPS didn't receive indoors (I have other GPS enabled devices that do) but the seller advises that this dongle probably won't work indoors because the GPS signals are too weak. I took it outside and it quickly locked onto multiple satellites and generated a precise 3D position fix and updated the PC's system time clock.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to connect to an 11 inch Lenovo Thinkpad Edge running Debian 10 (Linux). What you get is the dongle in an antistatic bag. The product is clearly aimed at people who actually know what they're doing so don't expect anything other than the dongle itself, such as a manual or driver CD etc. I've seen a couple of reviews by people who clearly received theirs and don't have a clue what to do with it :)When the device is connected it will appear as a new tty in Linux, mine comes up as /dev/ttyACM0 in Debian 10. If you've installed gpsd it automatically sees this and knows what to do with it. There's literally zero set up. Any software the uses the gpsd socket will get a position as soon as there's a satellite lock. There's a green LED on the dongle which flashes on and off to let you know it's receiving a signal from satellite(s). I've just been out in the car using it and walking about in the garden, there's not a lot in the way of GPS drift and it seems to be accurate. I've come back into the house and obviously the satellite lock has gone but coming up into one of the upstairs rooms I can see it can see 6 satellites up here indoors which has surprised me. If you're using software that wants to talk directly to the dongle and you're using something like Debian you might need to do something like (as root) usermod -a -G dialout <username> in order to be able to access the device directly as your user (and completely log out and back in for this to take effect).There's literally nothing to complain about here, the dongle just works.If you're in any doubt whether your (linux) machine can see data from it then just cat /dev/ttyACM0 (or /dev/ttyUSBwhatever yours shows up as, just run dmesg after you've connected it, you'll see the tty listed there and also gpsd will log it's connected to it). When catting the tty you'll see a bunch of NMEA data flowing out of it. If you can see that and you've gone outside for long enough for it to lock on to some satellites and start flashing its green LED then there's definitely nothing wrong with the dongle so if you've got further problems it's likely to be some config issue.I'd suggest these steps,install gpsdattach donglerun dmesg to see the assigned ttycat /dev/ttyACM0 (watch for NMEA data)install foxtrotgpsstart foxtrotgps which will just talk to gpsdcenter mapsee where you are, record a gps log etc.You'll see it's all working fine then, hopefully.God knows what you'd need to do in Windows land though :)Hope this review is of some use to people...",
