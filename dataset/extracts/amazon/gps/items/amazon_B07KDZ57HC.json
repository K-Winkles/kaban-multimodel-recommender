Had issues with GPS signal trak4 going to cell triangulation but this was due to trak4 location on equipment. Moved to better location and have not lost GPS signal since.

This device is a game changer for anyone looking to keep track of their vehicles or valuable assets. From the moment I unboxed it, I was impressed by its compact size and the simplicity of its design. The setup was straightforward and hassle-free. I just connected it to my ATV battery, created an account on the web, and I was ready to go. The user interface on the web interface leaves room for improvement. It could be more robust to help justify the monthly charge. Overall, I recommend the Trak-4 12v GPS Tracker to anyone seeking a reliable and efficient way to track their vehicles or assets.",

                "reviewText": "Ordered this to track my trailer for when I drop it at meat packers for loading. They have a bad habit of not notifying drivers that trailer has been loaded. I stuck an apple tag on trailer but the update frequency wasn\u2019t good enough along with other things so I figured I would try this tracker. It was cheap and yearly subscription was decently priced. Lots of good reviews so I figured why not. Got my tracker delivered and put it on a charger while I signed up on the website. Let it charge for a while and didn\u2019t show up on the website. Contacted support and was told it sometimes takes a DAY for it to show up. I should have asked for a refund at this point but continued testing out. After waiting a day I was told this brand new device was not compatible with new update. Support sent me another in the mail and it arrived a week later. It was tied together with a rubber band and put in a USPS shipping bag. I didn\u2019t really care it looked used because it was going to be hidden on trailer. After more back and forth with support I was able to get new device added to account. I paid for tracking every 10 minutes but that\u2019s not happening. If tracker doesn\u2019t move it will automatically go to tracking once a day. So once I stop somewhere for 30 minutes or so it switches to some kind of hibernation mode. Was told something about it was to save battery life. Being hardwired to a big car battery I don\u2019t see why this would be an issue. Got this unit because I could hardwire it and wouldn\u2019t need to worry about recharge it. Left my house 2 days ago to pick up a load and it pinged a few times hours after I moved. It stopped reporting where I picked up and started reporting a few time yesterday. Did the same today but stopped reporting after I was moving. Looks like it stopped a few hours ago at the stop light where I was getting back on the road. I\u2019ve traveled almost a thousand miles in the last 2 days and it\u2019s disappointing on how it tracks. I believe it skipped tracking me for a few states. With getting a replacement and me not being home right away to test out, I\u2019ve gone past the point of being able to ask for a refund. Happens a lot as truck driver.Support is quick to reply but have a feel of canned messages. If you don\u2019t really care about tracking frequency this might be for you. Even with their premium planes you will only get a ping daily if it moves. Actual tracking according to the plans have been spotty at best. Only good for when it might be stolen I guess. Will be able find if it stays in 1 location for a few days from what I\u2019ve seen these last couple of months of using it.",

                "reviewText": "Have had a 12 vdc TRAK4 installed on a cargo trailer parked outside in the SWFL hot sun for nearly a year now and this device has never missed a report. It even reported a recent temp of 143F from its location on a \"hot tin roof.\" Eleven solid months of SWFL exposure and that device is STILL \"ticking.\"The website \"trak-4.com\" is easy to use and with 3 optional service levels, reasonably priced.Because I no longer need this trailer, I asked about selling it with the device still installed. In particular, could the buyer register the device for his own use if I provide it's key code.Gosh, I hardly send an email to tech support and a company rep got back in a few hours! Just as I hoped, all I need to do is cancel the device from my account, give the buyer its key and the new buyer can register it if he pleases.Given that the original purpose of this trailer was to transport a Harley or expensive lawn machine, I was somewhat concerned about being able to TRACK IT should it ever be stolen.Attached pictures show it installed on the trailer's roof next to solar battery charger. A small sealed 12 vdc battery was placed inside an empty \"Chia Seed Jar\" and strapped to the interior trailer frame. There's also a sample portion of report showing a recent movement I made with the trailer.What a terrific product.I've got two more of the devices: one wired and one rechargeable. One boat will get a wired installation in a covert location with solar recharge panel for its small discreet battery and the other will be a \"Portable Pack\" where I can move that unit from one vehicle to another.Gosh I'm happy with the this product and its parent company!",
