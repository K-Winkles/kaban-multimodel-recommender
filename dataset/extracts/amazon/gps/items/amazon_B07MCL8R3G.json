This works great in A3 8P, and many other Audi VW models. Even for many cars that didn't have nav head unit, there is often a very good GPS antenna installed, anyway, and a hidden connection in back (so you need a longer connector). If your car did have an OEM nav head unit with the Fakra cable connection to the antenna, you just need this little pigtail to use your existing GPS antenna with an aftermarket head unit like the Xtrons Android I installed in my 2012.",

I believe any European car will use this adapter size.Basically, when you purchase an aftermarket Android deck, it will come with an external GPS antenna that you sticker onto the dashboard. Most cars have a GPS antenna, even if it wasn't optioned with navigation from the factory. When you use the factory GPS antenna via this adapter, instead of the one that comes with the radio, it is infinitely more accurate--plus, you don't have to have the antenna on the dash.",
