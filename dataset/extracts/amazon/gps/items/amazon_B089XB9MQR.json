                "reviewText": "Excellent device. Prior to this I had a Rand Mcnally TND 70 tablet. The tablet would glitch and freeze and eventually it stopped working. I had insurance on it but since they didn't make the TND 70 assurion issued a E gift card for Amazon. This TND 750 is a great tool. It's been fairly accurate. I like the upgraded map software, it's user friendly and has useful features. If your a trucker looking for a GPS I highly recommend the TND 750. I like how the most recent update you can check your ETA for either the current leg ( if doing multiple stops) or entire trip as well as the remaining time for both.",

The first thing you\u2019ll notice is that it requires you to register your product so that you can receive updates. After updating the 750 right out of the box, I also noticed the new interface, the settings are easier to navigate and the device is packed with many new features. I\u2019m loving this thing, it\u2019s super smooth and fast! It has an auto brightness feature, which automatically dims the screen when it\u2019s dark so the brightness doesn\u2019t kill you and automatically brightens the screen when the sun is out so you can see. I\u2019m super satisfied with this upgrade. I went with the bigger screen because I\u2019m aware the interface takes up a lot of screen space and I like to see everything.",

                "reviewText": "Alright here's the deal.For what it costs ($385) its excellent in what it offers and the quality but it does have its cons. It offers a lot of setting parameters that you would expect from a GPS aimed to assist truck drivers like height and width settings, bridge warnings, narrow roads, axle ratings, etc. It also comes with a anti-glare screen protector which is a nice touch. Its also setup like a tablet more than a GPS which is nice if you can maintain a wifi connection with it for media purposes and internet.Cons:-You have to be incredibly specific when putting in an address. This system is the biggest grammar nazi you'll ever encounter. Something as simple as not capitalizing a street name will result in it not finding your address.-The route it suggests is NEVER the fastest route so be warned. It will SPECIFICALLY stick to major highways which is fine but It may add 20 minutes to your trip.",

I bought it so I could use the weather feature but I can't get it to pair up to my hotspot or tether it to my Bluetooth. When I type in a legit company address it can't find it. So I end up typing in the city or town to get me in the right direction. Now mind you I have the company gps but its not great either, but 10,000 more times reliable than this POS! Even typing in a city this thing would get me lost if I didn't have a clue on where to go. If I followed this thing I would be getting off on every exit I pass and then getting back on the same highway I'm traveling on. Exit and enter same highway, hahahaha WTF?!? The graphics are good, but that's about all. I use it to show me upcoming turns, posted speeds and that's it. If I wasn't out on the road I would have returned it and bought a Garmin, but its past the 30 day return policy. I like the hell out of the Rand McNally 2023 laminated trucking map that I use often, but this gps is garbage. DON'T BUY IT!!!!!",

Screen gives me so much data, clear route choices, weather and traffic updates, lane changes etc. It is accurate and the screen control for automatic brightness is spot on. So simple to use and it tracks each of my trips so I can document later. Well worth the money. I am now a Rand McNally guy.",

                "reviewText": "I have driven charter buses for over 25 years; starting when there was but paper maps to rely upon.I have owned Garmin, Tom Tom and Magellan GPS devices. I bought my first Rand McNally in the days of model 730. The 730 won me over. The 750 has made me consider reverting to a Garmin OTR 1000.Those who report that the 750 takes you on-and-off highways are right. Happened to me several times. I look ahead on the 750 route overview and stay on the highway accordingly.That aside, the overall routing is not the worst. Garmin has led me astray, too. I guess it all boils down (for me) to what I see on the screen while driving. In that regard, I do favor Rand McNally I find Garmin is too sparse in detail for my likes.Buses take bumps like trucks. The mount has not failed me so long as I affix it to the windshield properly. I wish updates were more frequent and comprehensive. The weather and traffic functions suffice for my needs.The 750 (as can many truck Garmins) create bus profile. I do not believe any GPS exists that is perfect.If I were forced to make a choice on one device - - the Garmin OTR 1000 wins by a country mile.Happy Motoring Everyone!",
