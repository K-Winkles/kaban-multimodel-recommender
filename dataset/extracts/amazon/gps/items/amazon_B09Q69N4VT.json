The waterproof casing is packed with a motion detector, a GPS tracker, and the hardware to notify you if your bike is being messed with or moved. The better you hide it on your bike, the safer your bike will be. Within a minute after detecting movement and not detecting your Key Fob, the Monimoto tracker calls you on your phone. THE KEY FOB All you need to do is have the Key Fob with you - no buttons. We suggest carrying it somewhere in your riding gear separately from your keys so you do not lose it. As soon as you (and your Monimoto Key Fob) leave your motorcycle behind, the tracker will not be able to detect your Key Fob anymore. When that happens, the tracker arms itself and its motion detector. If anyone - from thieves to rowdy kids - handles your bike, it will know. THE MOBILE APP The App will notify you if your Monimoto GPS tracker detects movement. If your bike is stolen, your App will reveal its location so your precious ride can be recovered as soon as possible. When you ride your motorcycle, the Key Fob disarms the tracker. But when you are away and the tracker detects movement, it will notify you and activate its GPS tracker if it starts moving. From that point on, you will get constant updates on its location.",

This is an important feature. I should not have to rely on or screw around with an app in the event my bike is attempted to be stolen. There is an app included with the tracker, and it seems to be effective, though I've never had to use it much.You will pay a small yearly fee for the sim card on the Monimoto. This is fair, as you are just paying for what you are actually using. Once again, there are many GPS trackers out there that are trying to charge you arbitrarily high prices and insane monthly subscriptions just to use their service, which are generally just providing the illusion of security. This is a one time purchace with a small ocasional fee. I hope more motorists find this product as it is one of the only one's that is actually protecting your vehicle from theft whilst not robbing you every 30 days in the process.",

Also the yearly subscription is way cheaper the any in the market now.My residence always had low signal strength but this had no trouble warning me of movement.Initially, map and GPS location does not show. They shows after it is triggered and the location has good accuracy even after the sensor was placed under the fairing.The app seems simple but it shows all the necessary info, such as fob and sensor battery levels.Thus came with 2 zip ties and sensors has slits to secure unto any available spots.This is must have for any riders and gives you a peace of mind.",

Other than that it was working fine. I was out in contact with customer service via the app and they have been supper helpful. While they couldn\u2019t fix the problem they sent me a new one and transferred the balance of my SIM card to the new unit. While the unit operated as stated I can\u2019t say how mush I respect a company that stands by what they sell. I know nothing last forever but when things go south it\u2019s refreshing to deal with customer service that tries to do the right thing and makes the process as painless as possible . The accompanying app is easy to use and setup of unit is painless. If you have a motorcycle or car this device is well worth the piece of mind for the reasonable cost.",

                "reviewText": "Took forever to get through the set up because it refused to recognize the tracker despite following the very brief and not very helpful troubleshooting instructions. I never actually got completely through the set up at that, I was only able to get it to connect to the bluetooth eventually and that took forever. It refused to connect to the network and continually said GSM error. I live in a populated area, and tried it in various places. It says it takes 2 minutes to check, it took at least 8 each time it did the process and I spent almost 2 hours trying to get this to work. I went outside, still didn't work. Went across town, still didn't work. Held it up high, no dice, etc., etc. Well, if I cannot even get it to recognize the network in a populated area where all GSM networks have complete coverage, how can I trust this to give me an update if something were to happen to my bike? I was excited for this because it has an awesome battery life, doesn't require constant power with the possibility of draining the bike's battery, is pretty easy to conceal, etc., but nope. Had to return because it refuses to connect to the network and I refuse to pay a subscription fee for a product that may or may not work when I actually need it to.Edit: I used another tracker that uses the same network and it worked right away. No idea why this didn't.",

                "reviewText": "I've always been out off buying a tracker because of the price and the hassle of getting it wired into the electrics, then i saw the Monimoto 7,it's battery operated, so that's a result.The reviews were all excellent, and the 7 is the third and latest model, it's a lot smaller then the 'wand' type tracker in the previous models.This is about a cigarette packet size unit, you can attack it to your bike using the provided zip ties or like I've done use some velcro.The tracker is VERY simple to set up, first thing you need to do is download the app and follow the instructions, it'll be ready to test in a couple of minutes.Once fitted to the bike you need to place the key fob that comes with it approx 50m away, then you just shake the bike or move it a couple of feet, make sure you do this outside and not inside a garage.You will then receive a message in the app saying the tracker has been alarmed, it will also give you the exact location of the bike.The first three months are free to use it, then it's \u00a33 per month, well worth it for peace of mind, once the tracker is set up you can go into settings and manually turn the option on to recieve a phone call, I've done this as it'll be easier to hear at night when I'm asleep.With the amount of scumbags out there these days the monimoto 7 is just another level of protection to go with your ground anchor, chains, locks and disclocks, you'll never need to worry about the battery running out as it will warn you when to replace them, if you decide to buy this i promise you won't be disappointed, it really is an excellent buy of kit.",
