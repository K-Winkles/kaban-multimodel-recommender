                "reviewText": "When you first use this, or are flying a place you've never been before, it can take around 5 minutes to get the 8 satellites, but the next battery it locks onto the satellites within a few seconds. I wanted to get my speed with this but it will also be very helpful in finding a lost quad if that ever happens. I haven't tried the return to home. It seems like really experienced pilots have had trouble getting that feature to work properly so I doubt I've figured it out. I hope I never have to find out, but if I do have to try it and it fails, I'll have the longitude and Latitude to go find the thing. $20 is a really cheap insurance policy to protect several hundred dollars worth of equipment. If you crash and lose a $400 quad with a $400 GoPro on it, you'll wish you had spent the $20 on this.When you plug in the first time it will flash 0 Satellites and 0.000000 for your GPS coordinates. After a minute or two it will start giving the GPS coordinates but still flash 0 Satellites. If you arm and fly at this point it will flash something about no RTH function. After 5 minutes it will start listing satellites. Once you have 8, you're good to go.",

The red plot is this BN-880 unit (Active antenna) the purple plot is the same setup but with a different unit that has a passive antenna. The difference you see is typical for these units. I'm hoping more testing with a moving GPS sensor will get better results that passive filters. The added compass may help some people.The unit seems to power up very fast when hot, like < 1 sec. Cold < 1 min.To get this unit workingPinsGPS TeensyWhite GNDYellow 3v3Green RxRed TxInstall TinyGPSPlus (TinyGPS will NOT read altitude and other items).

Does not track the 3 GNSSs like it states for an M8 series, such as GPS, GLONASS, Galileo. Most always defaults to 2 GNSSs, GPS and GLONASS for tracking.

It uses a 24L01 transceiver module and ESP32-CAM, with its own WiFi. It also has a MicroSD card reader, with a 128Gb SD card, so I can record a series of waypoints and then have it repeat the same trip. It is a lot of fun to send it on a journey around the house and have it appear a few minutes later coming around the other corner and have it stop where it started.
