Good thing the cord hung on because it would have crashed down to the ground multiple times. Sometimes even while driving, the darn thing pops loose.I was skeptical that this friction mount would actually hold the GPS while accelerating, cornering, etc. but it's actually held up way better than expected. I'm sure if I had to brake hard it would lurch forward but honestly, I bet the suction cup would pop off as well. I'm glad I got this since it solves a very real problem with those annoying suction mounts. I haven't found a good one of those yet. :)",

The display screen in the car is supposed to stick to the windshield with a clamp-on type suction cup. However, the suction cup kept giving out and the screen would fall and then go sailing across the dash every single day. Since our screen has a similar ball type attachment on the back, I took a chance on this working with it (since it's advertised as being made specifically for a Garmin)... and it works PERFECTLY! The display screen now sits right where we put it and hasn't moved an inch since we set it up... which is saying a lot because my husband likes to drive our little Mini like it's a racecar and takes corners fast sometimes. LOL!We couldn't be happier with our purchase.",

It is also easier to see in the new location and even better it does not obstruct my view through the front windshield. My dash is not flat but it still does not move at all. It is so much better than having it on the windshield. I am so glad that I bought this.",
