                "reviewText": "I previously had a Garmin Nuvi 2577 and this one is very similar except it seems faster. Otherwise, it operates very similarly. Travel ETA works well - provided you're not in an area with heavy traffic on a regular basis. Drove with this en route to LAX on a Saturday and the ETA would update back and forth on a regular basis by as much as 30 minutes. Let's not put too much of that on Garmin though. My passenger was checking similar on google maps at the same time and it was back and forth too. But FYI.Meanwhile, with my Nuvi, I would routinely load 'points of interest' (POI) using Garmin's separate loader for such things. Worked great. Problem with the Drive 53 is though that loading POI only works if you're using a Windows machine to load them. I'm mainly an Apple Mac user though. Didn't work with my macbook pro. Garmin support said try on Windows. I happen to also have an old Windows machine too so I did. That worked. Garmin needs to put the POI loading capability into Garmin Express. Why is it done with a separate app? and now only working for Windows users?My old Nuvi 2577 came with both US and European maps loaded. This one only has US maps. Bummer. To get the EU maps, that'll be another $100. Why so much more?!",

I tried using Garmin Express to transfer from my old Garmin to my new Garmin. That didn't work. I then started to enter addresses manually. Got about half done and all the entered addresses in the GPS disappeared save for four of them. Beyond the return date. Garmin is ahead $169 and I have a useless GPS.",

                "reviewText": "Have used multiple Garmins for many years. One finally died so bought this one. Screen clarity is better than prior models. Seems to boot up a bit faster as well. Functionality is more complex than previous models are they have crammed new features into this model (too many in my opinion). Some changes make the model harder to use than older ones. I imagine I will get used to it. One oddity, typically the unit is mounted in the center area of a windshield. Many function buttons are now on the left side vs formally right. Feels odd as you loose visibility of the screen in this operating method.All in all, looks pretty good however more complicated to use compared to older models. Weather it be the latest version of Windows or this Garmin, software engineers continue to \u201cimprove\u201d products by making them less functional.",
