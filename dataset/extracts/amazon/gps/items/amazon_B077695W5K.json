I ended up with a spare SIM card from T-Mobile because the phone was free if I opened an additional line, so I wanted to make use of it. I give it 4 stars because it doesn't keep up live, but it accurately shows the final destination. Plus you can call the associated number and listen in, which would be a useful spying tool. Kinda creepy, but cool. Totally worth the money",

                "reviewText": "This is not a plug and play device. Intermediate electrical skills required. If you have such skill, and more time than money, this is the device to get. Took me an hour to connect power and mount unit. Spend another hour if you want to attach to shift lock solenoid. You have to figure out how to connect wires to your car on your own. I was able to find power with an ice pick test light. The manual suggests interfering with your oil pump to disable car. I recommend connecting the normally closed relay to shift lock solenoid. That way when Tracker sends shutoff command, the shift lock solenoid does not have power and car can not be put in to gear. Safest way to disable a car is when it's parked. You can do it their way and disable car when it stops at red light if you want. You won't be so happy to recover your car when another driver rear ends your remotely disabled car. The instruction manual is not detailed at all and tiny. The images are useless. You have to read and think. Study up on SMS, GPRS and GMS. I recommend US Mobile as a cheap carrier. On two of my cars all the wires I needed were behind the radio. I mounted the unit above the radio and attached to my center air vent. That way it gets less hot in summer by not being so close to top of dash and gets a little heat in the winter so it doesn't condensate and corrode. one last thought, you could also intercept the brake light switch. That would prevent car from shifting in to gear. You do risk a careless driver rear ending your car but gain a police officer noticing and arresting thief. Your call.",
