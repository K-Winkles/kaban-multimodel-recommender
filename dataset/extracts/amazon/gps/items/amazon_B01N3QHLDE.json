                "reviewText": "Although Standard Horizon has the same parent company as Furano, that's as far as the similarities go. Two different engineering standards. Where Furano has a detachable waterproof micro connector to the GPS antenna that will fit through a small hole in your topside and allow you to feed it through a generic antenna flange mount, not so with SH! Either you find somewhere to pack 49 feet of cable and hack through your topside with a 1\" hole saw to pass their plastic \"big nut\" PL-259 connector through (it's epoxied at the antenna head) or you cut the cable and fiddle with attaching small connectors (if you can find ones for all seven of the 24 gauge wires) or solder and heat shrink them.These designers need to be sent over to the Furano group for some mentoring. The part that was most annoying was that their \"special\" PL-259 it too large to pass through a standard SS flange mount so they include a \"special\" cheap plastic one with a larger bore. I cut the cable, tossed the cheap plastic mount and ran it through the existing SS mount to the GX6000 VHF. For the $ I spent I was expecting smarter, more responsible engineering.",
