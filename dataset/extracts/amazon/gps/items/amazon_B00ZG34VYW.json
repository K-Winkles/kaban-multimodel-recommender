                "reviewText": "Excellent device, clean and very well-designed, modern, simple interface. More intuitive and easy to use menus than Garmin. I like the large screen (less map scrolling needed) and you can customize part of the menu to select which items and what order they appear in. From sleep, starts up fast and locates satellite very fast. The included micro USB cord fits more snugly (a good thing) compared to a generic micro USB wire. Also fits more snugly than Garmin GPS unit I had.The included suction cup is low profile and works well and easy to attach. Make sure glass is clean. Just give it a quarter turn and it's locked. You can remove (or invert) the suction bracket it if you wanted to use this device in your own cellphone holder. If you don't like it on the windshield, a cellphone bracket designed for a cupholder or cd mount would be a good option as long as it was big enough.Bluetooth pairing it to a cell phone (free app) enables traffic and quickfix satellite updates (used to locate the satellites more quickly after startup). When you first get it, you'll want to install the PC software to get the latest map and you can use the pc software to get the quickfix updates.Yes, I still like my cell phone but it's nice to have a device that always works regardless of cell tower locations in rural locations and is dedicated to one purpose, particularly for road trips and going out of town. You can use a phone to navigate where there is good cell coverage but you are switching apps on your phone to do other tasks which is a hassle and a distraction. I didn't think I needed a separate GPS any more until I took a trip and realized that once you are away from major cities, or in the mountains, phone based navigation is hit or miss and you can be in the middle of nowhere with minimal map support on a phone and then you are compromising your safety. Even if you don't use it every day, it's good to have in your car. Seller delivered promptly and device was in perfect condition.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this model thinking my aging eyes would like the larger screen. Yes, the screen is good if you zoom it in. I have owned 3 TomTom gps over the last decade. I liked their easy to use interface. On this model there is nothing that resembles any of the of older interface. You can reach a menu that includes home and gas station buttons. On my older gps's there were also hotel, restaurant, and many other easily accessible points of interest. On this model you have to type the word hotel or restaurant on the keyboard and then hope to direct it to the city of your interest. There is voice activation of some features, but not any that I commonly use (e.g., hotel, restaurant). There are enormously complicated instructions to link it to your cell phone with Bluetooth. With this link up you get a 3 month trial that shows traffic congestion, red light cameras, speed cameras, etc. After the 3 months there is a subscription. I live in a relatively small town in Iowa and don't need any of those features. If you can chug your way through the 110 pg instruction manual and get usable gps info from this thing, you are a better person than I am. It is just too complicated except maybe for a techno-weanie.",

About the only bad thing I have to say about the product is that I really wish I could have pulled the SD card out of the old one and placed it into this one to have all my bookmarks. At the very least... it would have been nice to be able to download and upload them.If you travel a lot and save favorites... write them down... apparently none of these GPS manufacturers have figured out that we may want to archive our data and upload into future devices. :- (",

Software functions is subpar compared to 1605. Instead of displaying 9 icons on the menu it only displays 5 so you have to scroll one-at-a-time.
