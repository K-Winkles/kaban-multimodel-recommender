                "reviewText": "We initially got a GPS tracking device to be able to track our special needs son in the event he would go missing. We pin it to his pocket when he goes to school, when we are out and about on the weekends, and when we go out of town or on vacation. Our biggest fear is that one day he will go missing and he won't be able to communicate to someone who he is, where he lives, what the home number is, etc. With this device and the phone app, we have piece of mind that if he ever goes missing, we will be able to find where he is at. We love the comfort of knowing where he is at that we go one for our other child who is not special needs, just in case.We used to have another GPS tracking device that we used for a number of years, but that (as many of the older GPS tracking devices do) worked on the G2 network which is slowly being phased out. Over the last few years we've seen a lot of the functionality on that other GPS tracker go away. The thought of not being able to track our son was heartbreaking for us and finding a replacement GPS tracker was difficult to do because they all were using the 2G network. We finally found this Tracki device and per the specs it runs on the 3G network. I was so excited when we found this we immediately ordered a set of them. I will have to say I was skeptic at first because it seemed like such a new product (we ordered ours in August and all the reviews we were able to find anywhere were only from a few months ago) but we figured we had nothing to loose, if we weren't happy, we could cancel service. I will have to say that this device and the company have far exceeded my expectations and my experience with other devices.The price of the device is extremely reasonable. The plans are great. Right now, since we've been trying it out we went with the month to month plan, but at some point we will switch to one of their yearly plans, which will save us money.The app is still relatively new. It was released in March 2019 and they are at version 2.3. I can say that it has greatly improved and they are constantly making improvements and releasing updates. The app will get a notification for any of the triggers you setup (such as enter or leave a zone you define). If you want other people to get notified of activities, they don't need to have the app, you can setup the app to send text messages to specific mobile numbers and you can also set it up to send e-mail to specific e-mail address. It will show you the batter life that remains for the device, and you can set it to notify you if the device hits a percent battery life so that you know it's time to recharge the battery. The batter life is great, we go a few days without having to charge it. You can set it up to refresh location every 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 minutes or even 1, 2, or 4 hours. The app will even let you \"ping\" the device so that it will beep. We've used this option a few times when the kids didn't remember exactly where in the house they put their device. This is a great feature!! It will also let you see past history of the device movement, this might come in handy at some point if anyone goes missing.The device has some nice features as well. It has a power button so you can turn the device off at night. Other's don't have this. We power them down when the kids come home, that saves batter life. It has 3 buttons, one is an SOS button in case your child runs into problems, it will notify the app on the phone and let you know the SOS button was pressed. It has 2 other buttons as well that you can use for whatever you want to be notified for. It comes with a clip that you can put on, so a child can clip it to their pants. It has a little ring loop that you can put a key ring on. We put a small cable tie with a safety pin so that we could pin it to our sons pockets to make it harder to take off.You may see comments that say that the device is not accurate. I will say, based on experience on trying several GPS tracking devices, they are all like that. It might not update the second you look at the app, but it will update, just give it time.I've called customer support twice for help on two different items, and they were VERY accommodating and EXTREMELY helpful. In the \"Help - Contact Support\" section of the app, it has a button to \"Call Support\", so they make it easy to get a hold of them when you need to.",

I really highly appreciate Lara's customer service, praising the outstanding performance, user-friendly interface, and compact size of the location tracker. They commend its seamless setup, easy operation, and the app's overall convenience. Users find it adaptable to various spaces and express satisfaction with its tracking capabilities. While these positive aspects shine, some customers offer constructive feedback on areas such as accuracy, perceived value, and battery life, indicating potential areas for improvement. I actually lose my tracker and they were nice enough to replace it. Thank you Lara.",

                "reviewText": "Apr\u00e8s avoir test\u00e9 plusieurs traqueurs par le pass\u00e9, ce produit est une v\u00e9ritable r\u00e9v\u00e9lation pour moi. Non seulement il est intuitif, mais il est \u00e9galement fourni avec une carte SIM, un d\u00e9tail souvent n\u00e9glig\u00e9 par d'autres fabricants. Certains pourraient h\u00e9siter \u00e0 cause de l'abonnement mensuel, mais pour un montant allant de 14 \u20ac \u00e0 18 \u20ac, il offre un service mondial illimit\u00e9, ce qui est inestimable lors de mes d\u00e9placements internationaux.La pr\u00e9cision de la localisation est impressionnante, me permettant de localiser mes biens pr\u00e9cieux \u00e0 environ 2 m\u00e8tres pr\u00e8s, ce qui est rassurant lorsque je voyage avec des \u00e9quipements co\u00fbteux. L'abonnement peut \u00eatre annul\u00e9 \u00e0 tout moment, ce qui offre une grande flexibilit\u00e9. Le prix de lancement sur Amazon, \u00e0 seulement 19 \u20ac, est incroyablement comp\u00e9titif ; \u00e0 mon avis, ce traqueur pourrait facilement co\u00fbter le triple.L'utiliser avec mon chien lors de nos sorties \u00e0 la plage a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 une b\u00e9n\u00e9diction. La plage \u00e9tant un espace vaste, il est rassurant de savoir que je peux le localiser en cas de besoin. En param\u00e9trant le traqueur en temps r\u00e9el pour mon chien, la batterie tient tout de m\u00eame 2 \u00e0 3 jours, ce qui est largement suffisant pour le retrouver en cas de perte pendant nos sorties.L'application est non seulement user-friendly, mais aussi extr\u00eamement compl\u00e8te. Le service client est aussi digne de mention pour son efficacit\u00e9. Un mot sur la batterie : sa dur\u00e9e de vie est impressionnante si vous ajustez correctement les param\u00e8tres. Il est inutile d'avoir une mise \u00e0 jour de la localisation toutes les minutes. Pour mon utilisation personnelle, un rafra\u00eechissement toutes les 2 \u00e0 3 heures suffit amplement, permettant \u00e0 la batterie de durer jusqu'\u00e0 trois mois. C'est tout simplement incroyable.En somme, ce produit offre un excellent rapport qualit\u00e9-prix et je le recommande vivement \u00e0 tous ceux qui cherchent un traqueur fiable. C'est sans aucun doute un produit 5 \u00e9toiles pour moi.",
