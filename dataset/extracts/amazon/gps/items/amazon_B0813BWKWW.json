However:1 - The instruction booklet that came with does not provide instructions for anything beyond unboxing and installation. There are so many features in this unit that I have no idea how to use.2 - The 7\" display is nice but it's high gloss so, even with the sunshade (great idea) in place, the glare from reflection makes the display difficult to see in bright light, even with the brightness at 100%.3 - Most of the additional functionality requires a SIM card which means an additional \"phone line\" charge on your cell bill and likely LOTS of data usage.Overall it's not a bad GPS but, for the price, is better as a tablet with all the extra built-in stuff.",

MOST of the intructions are in a language other than english and i could not even do the simplest tasks like put in an address. too late to return so a waste of money.",

                "reviewText": "I really wish I'd gone with a better known brand. This does work. It lets you know if you're speeding, which I LOVE, but the user interface is very clunky and it can be annoying to navigate the navigation device.Weirdly, it is like a tablet and it has things like games on it as well as navigation, which is confusing. I guess that would be nice if you had little ones to entertain in the car, but then kids normally have electronics already. Seems like a really strange choice to leave games on this thing.I came back to dock some stars because it recently let me in circles, then proceeded to completely stop navigating later in the day, and lead me way past my house. Thankfully it led me in a direction that I recognized. But be careful with this thing\u2026",
