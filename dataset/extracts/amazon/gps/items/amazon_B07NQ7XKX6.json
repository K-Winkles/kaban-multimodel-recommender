I will update this review in the future if things start breaking down, but the gps I bought was refurbished so I'm tentative to say lots of good things until a few more months of use. Out of the box, the device is working well and despite having to update the software with the latest maps and firmware (I think it was a 9gb update), the screen is bright, the touch screen is responsive, the UI is easy to read, and settings are easy to find and adjust. I usually drive around with google maps running in the background on my phone while this device is running for redundancy, and it's been accurate in navigation so far, especially in Houston with all the construction.",

It did the job for local addresses, but updates were extremely hard and I had to drag and drop files to update the GPS. Why should I have to delete files and then drag/drop them to update the maps??!!So I returned it for a full refund.So I got this and not only does it do the job, updates are easy and fast with the touch of a button. I've had no issues with finding any directions and I've glad I spent more for a quality product. The only issue I've had with this refurbished product is that during my drive, at times the maps screen keep switching by itself without me touching it. It's very annoying and I have to switch it back during my driving. After doing this about 4-5 times, the issue stops.Because of this issue, I'll give it a 4 stars.",

                "reviewText": "This GPS has many impressive features. Its screen size, resolution, and image quality surpass any other GPS I have used. The wireless updating feature is convenient, eliminating the need to connect to a computer. The smartphone app's functionality, allowing direct transfer of directions to the phone and receiving weather and live traffic updates on the GPS, is very efficient. A standout feature is the GPS's intuitive display of rest stops, eateries, and gas stations during long drives, which is incredibly helpful.On the downside, like many Garmin products, the voice command feature is disappointing. It only worked once in numerous attempts, and even then, it failed to recognize my command accurately. Despite this, the GPS is still quite user-friendly without voice commands.I experienced a technical issue when my unit, which was refurbished, stopped functioning a few weeks after purchase. I have since ordered a replacement. Overall, I would give it a strong rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars. Look no further - buy it now!",
