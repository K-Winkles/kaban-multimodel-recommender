All outlets work with my phone charger, and the green light on this power cord came on momentarily. No power was ever supplied to the GPS and the housing on this cord got extremely hot. Upon further research, this cord provides no where NEAR the proper current to run the 7\" gps.Don't waste your time or money. I needed this to work, and ended up paying a lot more for a manufacturers branded power cord. I should have just done that in the first place.This cord is junk, and falsely advertised.",
