Since it hasn\u2019t left the property I can\u2019t say with certainty how well it works but I can track it around the farm so I know it works. I will get an alert when I get close to the geo boundary. It\u2019s very easy to hide on a piece of equipment and cost of monitoring is reasonable. If you have automobiles or expensive equipment I would definitely recommend getting this.",
