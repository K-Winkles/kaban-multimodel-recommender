                "reviewText": "Had a working unit for about a year and a half - operative word: HADTop feature: The screen size and amount of information is great! The autosizing feature ranked on your speed is also a great advantage when driving a large vehicle (RV).OK: Since there is no software to feed desired waypoints or destinations (like family members) makes the unit a bit unwieldy. You can handle this issue.Bad: The mount is incredibly fragile - not worth the plastic it's made of. And since the unit itself is large the cantilever effect as you are driving may make it difficult to see detail. Had to prop my unit underneath to steady and support it.Really Bad: My unit simply stopped working after about 18 mos. - no warning, and cannot get it to respond. LOVPOI does not respond to my queries, so I have to question the quality of the unit. Don't know if I am going to replace it.",

                "reviewText": "This is marketed as a \"Truck\" GPS.- does not show weigh scales- does not show state lines- does not show rest stops- does not show highway mile markers- The screen will not change brightness. It would be nice if the \"day screen\" could be adjusted brighter.It would be nice if the \"night screen\" could be much dimmer.- There are very few cities in the memory. If the city you are searching for is not in the system data already, it will not let you program the city. You must program something close, then guess from there.- the highway programming is vastly out of date, example . . . I was getting a 40 mph \"speed warning\" on I-80 in Wyoming (posted at 80 mph) and I could not turn it off- I attempted to create a route, but the gps refused because I was \"overweight\". I checked system settings, changed settings to 20 tons, and the system AGAIN refused to program that route (I-80 in Iowa).This might be acceptable for a car, BUT it is marketed as a \"Truck GPS\"As such, it is worse than useless..I vowed that when I returned home, it was going straight in the garbage.But, instead, I had someone give it to a co-worker (whom I dislike) and got my revenge by watching him fight with this thing . . . . . ..",
