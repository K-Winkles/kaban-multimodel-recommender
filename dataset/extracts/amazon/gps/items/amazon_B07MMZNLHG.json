                "reviewText": "I bought this Garmin 010-02038-02 DriveSmart 65, Built-In Voice-Controlled GPS Navigator with 6.95\u201d screen to replace a smaller Garmin DriveSmart that was about 6 years old.All the features look and work similar to the old one so there wasn't much of a learning curve for me. The bigger screen makes this unit much more pleasant and easy to use. It is faster than the older one. It's also more intuitive and narrows down the possible choices and presents more options for the address or places as you are entering the information. It has a lot of choices for map layout so you can customize to your preference. Voice command is also better than the older unit, but not perfect. With the old one the more I used the voice feature the better it got, to a point. This one is better out of the box and it may get even better with use. It is easy to update the maps and firmware through wifi sitting in the driveway, and quicker at it than the older unit. I have found these dedicated GPS units to be much better than the factory entertainment/GPS systems when it comes to directing you, and giving you options for routes. You can also link it with the cell phone app and have instant traffic updates and options for avoiding congested areas. The price seems more than fair for a GPS with so many features. I like the Garmin interface better than others I have used so it was a no brainer for me to buy it.",

                "reviewText": "This is my 6th dash top Garmin gps. I have used Garmin Nuvi's for a long time. I like this one better than all the past ones. It is very easy to use and I really like the large size. It is easy to see even in bright sunlight, way better than any of my past models. I do not use the bluetooth function for the phone or the voice command so I cannot comment on them. It has built in wifi so once you connect it to your home network, it will automatically download upgrades without connecting to your computer. If you have purchased custom \"voice\" files, like Dr. Nightmare, they provide no way to install them...at least it is not documented. You can download them to your computer and then copy them manually to the proper folder in the GPS and they will work fine.I would recommend this GPS for anyone who wants to get from here to there with ease. It works great!!Dislikes! I do have a few....1. I do not like the way this model attaches to the ball mount. It take two hands to release it whereas all of my other models could be easily released with one hand and they were still very secure in their attachment.2. I am an avid geocacher, since 2003. ALL of my past models could easily display geocaches on the screen. All you had to do was put them in a .gpx file and copy them to the proper folder in the GPS. THIS model does not do that very well. You can follow the same procedure but instead of getting the neat little geocaching icons on the screen you get these big ugly icons that look like tabs or signs. I do not like this at all...big downer. But the overall good outweighs this downer. There is a \"workaround\". You can export your caches to a POI file and copy it to the POI folder in the GPS. All of the caches will then display on the screen using a much smaller, and less ugly icon. You can then select one and navigate to it. The upside to using POI is that you can have more of them. I easily put in over 3000. The name of each one will NOT display on the screen, but at least you can see them. If you touch one, you can navigate to it, or you can quickly find them in the menu. So.... it works well for geocaching but not quite as well as any of my older, smaller models.3. I use LINUX on my computer, not Windows. I also have a MacBook laptop. ALL of my older model Gamins would plug into Linux or Mac and display on the screen like a disk drive. You could then drag and drop your .gpx or .poi files over to the proper folder. THIS model GPS will NOT do that.... not on a Mac and not using Linux. You MUST have WINDOWS to transfer your files. This really sucks... I had to install Windows on my desktop using dual boot just to retain my sanity. I admit I am a Windows hater. I could give you reasons but I'll spare you. So if you are a Windows hater like me, plan on being disappointed. Again, the good of this GPS outweighs ever this. It is a keeper.4. Although this GPS is very very easy to use and easy to figure out, the documentation is poor. You might even say it sucks but not quite that bad. If you are a basic user, new to GPS, then the documentation is OK but if you want to do more complicated stuff, you just have to figure it out for yourself.",

I love how I can build a list of favorite destinations and name them what I want. The only issues so far are that it can't detect the exact location of my home (Will see if I can use coordinates. Not sure if that's an option.) And it doesn't tell me time to destination, but it does give arrival time. So that's not a big issue. Overall, I really like it.",

It had too many features which were useless to me. They were also confusing.Garmin Drive 55 & Traffic has just the right amount of features. When going out I do a search on Garmin Drive App on my mobile phone in my home. When I get into the car I send the directions to the Garmin Drive.I love my Garmin drive 55 for these features. 1) Lovely uncluttered screen. 2) Excellent directions when driving on highway. It gives ample warning on what lane to be in. Speed limits is clearly visible and when I exceed it there is a beep. This alone will prevent me from accidentally speeding with all the traffic cameras in Toronto.The traffic information is fair. When driving to a specific location in the busy city like Toronto I use GoogleMaps which is much more accurate and detailed.Voice recognition is poor. I only use it for \"Go Home\"",
