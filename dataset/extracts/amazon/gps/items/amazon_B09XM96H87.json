                "reviewText": "I loved adding this to my Golf Cart. I confirmed the accuracy on the street in my Jeep and it was right on. The GPS speedo confirmed the improvement in my cart speed when I made a modification. Yay.The downside is the brightness. Great in the shade and night but completely washed out with any sun hitting it. I tried to find a spot on the dash to minimize the wash out but wasn't too successful. Regardless it is only poor when the sun is behind the cart. And for the price it is a nice option. Locates the satellites and gives me direction and accurate time within a few seconds of starting up. Wired it to my 12v keyed relay powered to a USB voltage converter. (also cheap and useful)",

                "reviewText": "Fairly accurate , shows accurate time once locked with the satellite which takes just a few seconds. However number of issue I came across which doesn't render the device useless but could improve functionality.The pros : Fair pricing , compact size designed to sit on the dash yet don't obscure your view from the road.5v usb powered means less power consumption and can be hooked to any available USB outlet or from the fuse box through a dc-dc converter.Not so hard to operate even with a single wave button.Shows real-time speed, acceleration, trip distance, and trip duration. Alarm can be set for max speed, and driving duration .Built in light sensor to govern the panel britgness . Very useful .The cons : The gps speed is shown on the left side of the panel , a compass or heading on the middle and time or trip info on the right. This is not a good design, the compass heading is basically in accurate and not really useful in real time. The primary function of the unit is gps speedometer yet it is placed on the left side where the digits are readable but a bit small so need pretty much to look at to see what speed you are going. If the gps speed reading was set in the middle with bigger digit size, that would be a very practical solution.* The gps speedo meter reading in this unit is 1mile faster in general .* The speed refresh rate is poor meaning when the car is accelerating or slowing down ,the speedometer lags to show the variation of speed and at least 1 seconds slow of real time speed.* all the trip records , max speed , etc get reset once vehicle is turned off.Verdict : if you need a cheap but functional gps speedo meter, it is a decent option even with some little flaws and is still a good choice for your cars gadget addition . Overall I'm not returning the unit and happy with it.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Exactly what I wanted, and then some! -- UPDATED!",
                "reviewText": "(Additional updated information at the end of the review concerning customizing the display and the acceleration timer)When I discovered this device, I was just looking for something that would tell me how far I've driven on any particular trip, and then automatically reset to zero for the next trip. My car odometer can be programmed for that, but I usually keep it displayed to miles driven since my last refueling, so I wanted a separate display for the trip mileage.Not only can this device do that, but it does so much more! There are eight main functions: vehicle speed, compass heading in degrees, trip distance, trip time, time of day clock, elevation, acceleration timing, and number of GPS satellites that are being received. There is more flexibility in displaying this information than implied in the photos in the product's description! The left digital display can show either speed or compass heading, while the right display can show any of the other six functions (trip distance, trip time, etc.). The left and right displays are set independently, so there are a possible 12 combinations of what data is displayed. What's more, unlike what is implied in the photos, the display graphics and center compass gauge can be displayed with any combination of displayed data, not just with certain combinations. Also, it can be easily set to either English or metric units, and all settings are memorized, even when disconnected from power. There is also a speed alarm, but I have not tested it out yet. I also have not tested out the acceleration timer.If you find that the speed and distance readings do not match what your car's factory gauges read, then there is a way to calibrate that, as well. You may still have a slight error, but it's not much -- maybe about 1% or so.On a more specific point, I could have hardly asked for a better design for something like this for my car. I have a 2015 Honda Civic LX (9th generation Civic), and this device almost looks like it was designed for my car! Like the digital gauges on my dashboard, this device has white numbers with blue graphics -- albeit a different shade of blue. The overall shape of the display even mimics the shape of my car's instrument cluster! I believe the Si version of the 9th gen Civic has red graphics, so it would not be as good a match, aesthetically, but the functions would still work.There is supposed to be a way to turn off the graphics, but I have not found out how to do that, and I don't see it in the manual. It's no big deal for me, because I like the graphics, but some people might want to switch them off. Maybe someone here can weigh in on how this is done?Beyond that, this device is very easy to use -- just power it up through the USB port on the back of it. It gets all of its data through GPS satellite signals, so there is no need to hook anything to the OBD-2 port or anything else. All compass functions are also calculated based on GPS signals, so they are not affected by normal magnetic fields in the car -- but you do have to be moving for it to calculate a direction. It won't just tell you which way you're facing in a stationary vehicle when you power it up. And on my unit, I find it quickly locks on to enough satellites to work. However, the first time you use it, it may take a few minutes to locate the satellites, and in my experience, this is normal for most GPS-based devices.I'm using a USB power adapter that plugs into the cigarette lighter/power point. However, keep in mind that if you use a cigarette lighter adapter, some cars supply constant power to the cigarette lighter/power point, even when the car is switched off, so that this device would stay powered up when the car is off, unless you unplug it. It is designed to turn on and off based on whether it is getting power to its USB port, so there is no on/off switch on the device.Some people have reported that their unit broke down quickly. I have only been using mine for a few days, so I cannot yet comment on that. As long as it remains reliable, I feel this is a solid 5-star product!NEW INFORMATION --Okay, here's the additional information that I have learned about this device. First of all, I figured out how to turn the decorative graphics on and off, and like so much else with this product, there are actually more options than expected. First of all, selecting these options is so easy that I'm almost embarrassed that I didn't figure this out before. All you have to do is just tap in the 3-way switch on the top of the unit. Remember, this switch can toggle left, toggle right, or push in. If you push it in and hold it, you enter the set-up mode. But if you simply push/tap it in briefly (from the regular usage mode, not the set-up mode), you step through various display configurations with each tap of the button. You can select from numerous combinations of having the outer-edge decorative graphics on or off, having the center graphic compass on or off, and even being able to turn on or off the left or right side digital displays, in case you only need to see one element of data and don't want a cluttered display. Very easy, and very versatile.The second thing I want to review is the acceleration timer, which I have now tested. It more or less works as you'd expect -- if you select this function when you're at a stop, it shows zero seconds, and then when you start moving, it starts timing. The only thing a little bit disappointing here is that, even if you have it set to display English units (mph, instead of km/h), it still times to a speed of 100 km/h, and not 60 mph, before it stops the clock and gives you a 0-to-100 km/h reading. I could determine this because, when in English units, it stops timing at 62 mph, not 60, and 100 km/h is roughly 62 mph.Keep in mind that this function will be approximate, anyway, because if it is GPS based, then there may be an error based on how often the unit reads the GPS satellites. For example, let's say that it reads the satellites 2 times a second (and that is just a guess). It knows that you're not moving when it takes two or more readings in a row that show you at the same position. But now, once you start moving, when it takes the next reading, it will see that you have moved and start the timer. However, if it is taking a reading every half a second, then it has no way of knowing exactly when you hit the gas during the half second between the time it saw you standing still and the time that it now sees you at a new position, so there could be an error of up to half a second -- again, assuming that it takes readings every half second. Even if it takes readings more frequently, there could still be a small error. The only way around this would be if it has an accelerometer built in that could sense the car moving without having to take a GPS reading, but I have not read that this device is equipped with an accelerometer.To me, this is no big deal. Just think of the acceleration timer as a neat feature to get approximate acceleration times at a test track, and not as a serious performance timer. This in no way detracts from all of the other cool features of this device.",
