Plus it alerts you if you are over the speed limit. It alerts a lot, but you can change the sensitivity to speed.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the OHREX GPS Navigation for Car, and I must say that it has been a complete letdown. The promises of up-to-date maps and accurate directions were far from reality, leaving me frustrated and wasting valuable time.One of the major issues I encountered with this GPS system is that it was not up to date with addresses. It was shocking to find that even basic addresses were missing or outdated. This made it incredibly difficult to navigate to my desired destinations, resulting in unnecessary detours and delays. It is absolutely unacceptable for a GPS system, especially one that claims to have free lifetime updates, to be so out of touch with current address information.Furthermore, the OHREX GPS Navigation failed to provide correct directions. There were numerous instances where it directed me to take wrong turns or provided confusing instructions. This not only caused unnecessary stress while driving but also wasted precious time and fuel. A GPS system should be reliable and accurate, but sadly, this one fell short on both counts.The lack of accuracy and up-to-date information severely impacted my overall experience with the OHREX GPS Navigation. It is disheartening to invest in a product that fails to deliver on its promises. I expected better from a GPS system that specifically caters to truckers, RV owners, and commercial drivers.I strongly advise against purchasing the OHREX GPS Navigation for Car. Its inability to provide accurate addresses and correct directions makes it an unreliable and frustrating tool. Save yourself the disappointment and consider exploring other GPS systems that have a proven track record of reliability and accuracy.I hope this review serves as a warning to other potential buyers who are considering the OHREX GPS Navigation for Car. Don't waste your time and money on a product that simply does not deliver on its claims.",

                "reviewText": "Love the size screen size for sure, a lot features that I still discovering. The only thing so far I\u2019m not to happy about so much is that the voice don\u2019t tell you in advance the real name of the coming exit or next street /avenue that\u2019s is coming you need to take. Only says \u201ckeep the next right\u201d\u201d or \u201c\u201d next left\u201d\u201d. But not the name of the street /exit to take. So weird. So I still checking if any control features will help to change it to make it to be accurate with the directions.So my experience so far it is so so.",
