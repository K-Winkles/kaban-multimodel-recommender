The speed limit, miles to or time to destination is a nice feature , and the new gas station /food signs are a nice addition. Also the school zone warning is one of my fave things when you're in an area you are not familiar with. By far our favorite GPS systems.",

On long drives this is crucial info. Also, once it didn't recognize a road while driving in Canda. It didn't turn out to be a big deal, but I would have thought it would come preloaded with the latest maps.",
