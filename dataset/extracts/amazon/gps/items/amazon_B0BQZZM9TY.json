Good for the money for sure. Didn't do the reverse camera but seems easy, I don't want to do it right now is all. Left a gap as you can see in picture even when I used Amazon fit, I guess it's not to see if it will fit perfectly but to see if it will fit in the radio slot possibly. All in all don't trust Amazon fit 100% that's where I went wrong.",
