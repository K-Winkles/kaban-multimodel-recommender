While the new system with it's 10\" Screen was amazing...I'm the kind of guy that wants all the full functionality of what this incredible system can offer so I purchased this Navigation Chip which simply slides into the front of the Radio Brain Unit behind the screen. It instantly updates and \"BAM\" you have up to date navigation for all of the United States in moments! If you have the Stinger Infotainment System and want all of the options...you must purchase and install this navigation card.

If there is a side road on the track, it will jump to it and \"RECALCULATING\". The software was updated properly, even working with tech support. The antenna is not near my Sirius antenna. NOTHING we do fixes this issue. This was a huge purchase point for me. Now, I have a $1500 device that does not function as it should. The $150 purchase of the iGO navigation card is a waste. I am super surprised that this product can even be released. I'm not the only one this happens to. I will leave the card in, in hopes someone at Stinger will get their product fixed. But for now, I would NOT RECOMMEND this product at all.",
