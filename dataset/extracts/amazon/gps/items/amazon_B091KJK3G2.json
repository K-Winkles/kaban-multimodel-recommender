                "reviewText": "Addendum: Device continues to work great. It checks out close to the same distance as my friend's range finders and smartphone apps. The only problem that I run into is that if I'm close to another hole or fairway, it sometimes gives me the yardage for that other hole. I still recommend this device after using it for several months. It holds it's charge for at least 3 rounds (I usually charge it after that so I don't know if it would last longer).I finally put it on my golf hat visor. I just reach up without looking and press the button. The device tells me the yardage. And it's accurate. I had tried to use my smartphone app as well as a range finder. Both were fine, but awkward to use and time consuming. This device takes the guess work out of my shots without being time consuming. I highly recommend it.",

Also, I bought this model (ES) because it was supposed to have a longer battery life of 20 hrs. So far, I used it for 1.5 rds the first week (6.5-7 hrs) and it needed a new charge. Charged it 2 days ago and used it for 9 holes yesterday, and it\u2019s down to about 40% battery power. Might be returning this device if the support team can\u2019t provide a solution.",

                "reviewText": "I'm an armature plain and simple but I love to play golf. I don't hit consistently but I also never know my distance to the green because I don't have that skill. With the Golf Buddy 2 I now know the distance with every shot I take. My club selection is no longer a mystery. I am finally putting shots on the green, or at least close to it, when I hit it right. I'm not coming up 20 yards short or 30 yards long.I've played 5 times total on 3 different courses since getting it. After updating and charging it I have not changed a thing. I get to the course, turn it on and go to the tee box. It tells me the hole I'm at and every time I touch the top button I know how far I am from the center of the green. It is that simple. There are lots more features but only using the distance to center of green I have dropped several shots on my game in each outing.It weighs almost nothing. I wear it on my hat and can't feel the weight of it. I wear a marker on the other side of the hat so the weights cancel each other out. I love this device and it makes me want to play more often.",
