                "reviewText": "Great alternative to ranger finders. I found I was with-in a yard or two from my golf buddies with range finders, and for my game thats plenty accurate for judging my club selection. Its super convenient to use Vs looking at a phone app. Plus my phone is busy blasting tunes to the cart bluetooth speaker, so i dont want to distract it from its job. The biggest problem is that it is very easy to loose. Do Not use the magnet on the cart, not that it will fall off, it stick strong, but you will forget it every single time you turn in your cart at the end of the round. Second, dont use the belt clip, whether the clip is attached to your hip or your bag, the thing will pop out at any location allong your outing. The single biggest upgrade they could add to these things is a Find-My feature for an iphone.",

                "reviewText": "This product is awesome. I played with a guy at my course with the older version and loved how you could begin to prepare for your next shot as you approached. So, I bought this newer version and right out of the box - updated the firmware and courses for my local course. It is so convenient to use with the magnet. Yardage is spot on against any other GPS (phone, handheld, etc) but much more convenient. The hazard distances are spot on as well. Much prefer this versus having my phone out on each shot. Obviously not as convenient for path only, but still works great and with the magnet you can carry it with you to your ball (just remember it!). Battery lasts me around 4-5 rounds before it need a recharge, but I usually forget to turn it off so perhaps you can get more out of it. For the price, there is not much better!",

I switched it to dark mode to save battery life. My buddies have laser range finders and this device is right there with the more expensive units. The only thing I wish it had was elevation. Definitely buy if your on the fence like I was.",
