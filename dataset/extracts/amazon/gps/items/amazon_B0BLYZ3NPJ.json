I have sent e mails to the support and I get nothing in return. I should of known better than to purchase anything like this off the internet. I didn't even want to give this one star but it wouldn't let me not.Update: Support finally contacted me and we were able to get one device working correctly, I am happy with it. The other one they ended up sending me another device but I still am not able to get it working. I can say they have been helpful and it has been appreciated.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought this VL04 after trying out a JC400 dashcam from the same manufacturer. The VL04 GPS tracker is super easy to install and is more accurate because it gets the first fix very quickly after starting the vehicle unless the vehicle is in a garage or other covered area that might block the GPS signal, in which case it can take 2-3 minutes. Get positioning. After that, cranking the settings up to max so it reports the location every 10 seconds, I can see the path the car is taking very accurately in the Lncoon app.In my case, I installed it in a Peugeot 5008 SUV, with a 15cm OBD extension cable that would move it to the side of the OBD port and be able to close the lid covering it.After binding the device, I need to top up. I first purchased a 1-month subscription for $12.99. So far, the experience is pretty well. I will always need it. When it's expired, I will directly subscribe to the 24-month plan, which only costs 5.99 USD per month.I'm not using any dangerous driving detection, lane changing, etc, as I have it on my personal car just to monitor it occasionally and possibly to help in the event of a carjacking (You know, cuz of the recent increase in carjackings).I recommend checking out the full list of commands available in the issues section to get the most out of this tracker. Commands can be sent by the Lncoon App.Overall, it's a perfect car tracker for me.\"",
