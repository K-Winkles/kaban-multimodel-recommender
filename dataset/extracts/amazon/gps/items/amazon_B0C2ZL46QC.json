                "reviewText": "As a lot of other reviewers have noted, the Atuvos trackers are a strong alternative to Apple AirTags. I found this out first-hand during a recent trip to Europe. I hadn't flown since before the pandemic hit, and I had heard horror stories about the increase in lost luggage. So I bought two 4-packs of the Atuvos tags, as well as a $6 bulk pack of low-cost, \"S\" style carabiners and I added them to every piece of luggage, my wife's and my carryons, my wife's purse, even my AirPods Pro.Adding them to the \"FindMy\" app on my iPhone 14 Pro was a breeze. Simply turn on the tag - that's right, they have a handy power on/off, reset button on the device - and add it to FindMy. It pops right up.Then the fun began. I started testing the tags to see whether they really would let me track my bags just about everywhere. As soon as my wife and I arrived at long-term parking at the airport, I started obsessing about FindMy and watching my bags move around with is.At the terminal, I watched as checked luggage hopped from here to there around the airport until it finally showed up on the baggage trolley next to our first flight. When we reached cruising altitude, I took a walk back from our seats near the front of the plane and suddenly all our luggage popped up right beneath me!When we got to our transfer in Amsterdam, I watched as our bags hopped off the plane, meandered there way over to our next gate, and finally showed up in the belly of our next flight.That's the way it went throughout our trip. The Atuvos trackers worked perfectly. The range is long, the beep is loud, and it gave me the confidence that if a bag really had gone missing I would have found it, or at least found the last place it had been before someone turned off the tracker.And that's the pro/con of these devices. They won't just turn off on their own. The button takes a good firm press, so it won't simply turn off with a bounce or jostle. But unlike AirTags they *can* be turned off. If someone finds one attached to your bag, it's a simple button press to disable the tracker and make your bag go \"off the grid.\"But for what they are, they're a GREAT value. They're sturdy, the clip hole is something Apple should have incorporated into AirTags, and their range is super-long, a claimed 400'.Highly recommended!",

I bought these for a cruise I was taking and wanted to be able to track my backpack and suitcases and also know that my truck back at home didn\u2019t leave the driveway. I was easily able to pair and name these devices on my phone. I attached them to the zipper inside my suitcases, backpack and truck with the little keychain o-rings you can buy. Anytime you walk away from any of these items, your phone alerts you. You can pull up a map and see where your items are. Best, most practical purchase I\u2019ve made in a while. When you\u2019re not using them, I.e., my suitcases, take the batteries out and tape them to the outside. This way they last longer and you don\u2019t get corrosion inside the device. I hope you are as happy with them as I am. Even though they aren\u2019t the \u201cI\u201d ones, they paired easily with my IPhone.",

                "reviewText": "I travel through many airports around the world. This device is OUTSTANDING. The Bluetooth linkage with my iPhone is stellar. I place one device in each of my travel bags. I watch their location in the airport and as they approach the baggage carousel. In airports where porters pull baggage off the carousel, these tags assist locating my bags. This device is EASY to install. I use colored heart icons \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udda4\ud83e\ude76\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9b to designate each bag. The \u201cFind Me\u201d app on my iPhone always shows their location, or their last known location when beyond Bluetooth range. I also gave a device to my wife for her key ring. Now, no more misplaced keys.",

                "reviewText": "Misplaced keys have been a long standing problem in my home so we thought we would try a 21st century solution. The product arrived well packaged and intact. Having four of these trackers was just the right number for us. The setup was fairly simple and went according to instructions. The Find My App on the iPhones picked up the devices immediately and allowed us to give each a name. Tracking was great! Open the app, click the tracker name and there it is on the map. Even if it is in the house it's good to know that the keys are there and not out in the world. You can activate the beeper to find a nearby tracker.I'm sure that there are many other tracking uses aside from keys for these cool little devices. In the meantime those long extended key searches have ended.",

                "reviewText": "Found these as a less expensive option which would work on Apple devices. The items arrived when expected. The instructions were clearly written. However I did a Google search and read through/watched for additional tips for adding a non-Apple product. My I-Phone did not recognize these trackers on the first attempt. Started over and then it connected. Successfully named and added the first tracker. Had a similar issue when I attempted to add the second tracking device the next day. Third tracking device loaded without a problem. I added my tracking device to my keys and placed them inside a far corner of my home to test the find function. Beeping worked and could be heard inside the house. My phone showed a general outline of my house footprint and reflected the tracking device was in the corner. When I asked for directections on my phone I received a message the item was with me. I was still about 25 feet from the tracking device. Not sure if the lack of more precise directions is due to the age of my phone or maybe my expectations were too high. Having said that, my spouse found the keys based on the beeping as they were hidden from view. I'm satisfied with the product for my intended use.",
