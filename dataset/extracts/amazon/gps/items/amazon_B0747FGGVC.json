                "reviewText": "We recently purchased the LandAirSea real time SYNC GPS tracking device via Amazon. The device easily plugs into the OBDII port on our vehicle, and therefore does not need batteries. The GPS is small, it\u2019s inside location is out of the way and not noticeable. We have only had it a short time but our experience is completely positive. The product works as advertised and we can monitor our vehicle travel both online over the internet and with the mobile smart phone app. We were able to install and configure the GPS device and begin using it as soon as it arrived. No tools are needed to install, just snap it into place in the OBDII port under the steering wheel. Please note the tracker needs to be activated for a fee (after purchase), this is a credit card transaction done online and only takes a couple minutes. Without activation the product cannot be used. The Serial Number on the back of the tracker is needed for activation. Several activation plans are available, we started with the base plan but may upgrade to a plan with a higher refresh rate later. We felt the device and activation cost was very reasonable for the vehicle tracking information it provides us. One, especially helpful aspect of the SYNC product is the ability to fence locations and notify us, 24/7, with text and emails (with date/time stamps) when our vehicle enters or departs the fenced areas. Tracking is performed in what looks like Google Maps, which is an awesome visual for following our vehicle. For our purpose, we defined two fences, with different names, around each location; one to track arrivals and one for departures. NOTE to LAS \u2013 a possible software upgrade could be a single fence with multiple tracking/notification definitions. However, there are other tracking and notification capabilities or methods in the interface with which I'm not familiar. Configuration is primarily performed online in your web browser (same for activation), then available to others who may perform monitoring. We will explore additional tracking configurations as we become more familiar with the tracker interface. Thank you LandAirSea, \u2026great product.",

I chose it because I didn\u2019t need to charge it.Overall i was very happy with performance. Low monthly payment about $9 a month. I was able to see history of locations in past 24 hours.The only problem with this unit is that it should be plugged to OBD-II port and after couple of months connection gets loose & unit often detaches & falls down over floor mat. Them tracking stops & you should be lucky it doesn\u2019t get any attention!Although this could be car OBD plug problem too, i still think the unit is not small enough for serving its hidden purpose. A tall driver knees may hit it when trying to sit behind wheel.Pls make it smaller & improve connection.I am switching to battery version for now.",

                "reviewText": "Works great and the PC software is very intuitive and easy to use. The app for the phone, I had some trouble with. The first app I loaded did not work at all. I ended up installing it and reloading the app from a different site and then it worked. That took awhile to figure out, but I haven't really used the phone app anyway. The software for the PC works great and has great features such as reporting. Highly recommended. I can't rate the tech support or battery life. The sending unit uses the car battery. I contacted tech support on a Saturday and did hear back from them on Monday, but I had the phone app figured out by then.",

                "reviewText": "I am purchasing the LAS SYNC device (OBD plugin) to track the movements of a personal vehicle. I also have the Momentum GPS tracker. I wanted to purchase from LandAirSea as they are a domestic family owed company and the real time tracking of the Momentum GPS tracker stinks.The installation and the app setup are easy as pie. For the most part, the tracking is very good and in real-time (an huge advantage over the Momentum GPS tracker). However, there are a few suggestions for improving the software: 1) the ability to track each trip seperate (currently, the software aggregates all trips each day together - which makes it VERY difficult to understand the movements of the asset). 2) the history does not show any times (no beginning, no ending, no duration) relating to the assets. This is a must for my needs. 3) the history playback can only be seen in green - and the map is in brown and green, which makes it difficult to see. 4) the device does not show any diagnostic information (distance, duration of trip, speed, battery, unplugged) - which is very disappointing.On the plus side - the software has the ability to share your route and setting up a fence is SOOOO simple to do. GREAT for knowing if your asset has moved.Compared to the Momentum GPS tracker, the LAS is MUCH better for simplicity and tracking the asset. However, the software does not provide the information I need - which is a deal killer. And I will return the item.",

After playing around with it for a few days I am very satisfied with how accurate it is and how flawlessly it updates on the devices/vehicles location. I haven\u2019t had a single issue with it yet! Also, dealing with their customer support line was a breeze when I had an issue setting it up. Would definitely recommend and purchase again!",

Loved the 3 second updates. You could see the exact route. Decided to buy a second one for our other vehicle. Same thing, wouldn't connect at first, but support was good and got it working. Now about 6 months later, one of my trackers isn't working properly. Emails to support go unanswered. Calling them (long distance to USA for me) appears to be the only way to reach them. I'm getting a replacement tracker sent to me by UPS. Hopefully the new one will work. The first tracker I bought is still working well, although it too does occasionally lose the signal. Will monitor to ensure it functions as it should.",
