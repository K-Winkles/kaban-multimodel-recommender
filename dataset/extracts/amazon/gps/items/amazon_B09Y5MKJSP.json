There are a large number of option for turning off un-wanted functions.4. I know if I am speeding. A big help:-)Cons:1. The sun shade is flimsy, but does the job. You have to place it on very carefully and position it just right.2. The instructions are printed way too small. I scanned them and enlarged them and then saved them to my laptop computer, so that I could read them, without a lot of eye strain.3. The routes it gives you are not the shortest. But. If you zoom out you can see where you really should go.I do recommend this product highly.",

                "reviewText": "GPS was obviously used, but I've already returned it, and wish I had taken pictures. Despite that, I plugged it in and attempted to use it. I know why it was returned....IT DOESNT WORK. It continued to say \"GPS searching\" for over an hour and never gave me directions. I even drove around to see if it would pick up the satellites, but no. Good thing I wasn't actually trying to get somewhere.",
