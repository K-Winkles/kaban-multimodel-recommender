        "description": "TWO SWORN ENEMIES. ONE CHANCE TO SAVE THE GALAXY.In the midst of an unforgiving galactic war, Joel Chambers and his unit never expected their greatest challenge to come from beneath their feet. While engaged in a fierce skirmish on a primitive planet, their reality is upended as a mysterious starship bursts from the ground, altering the course of their mission \u2014 and the war itself.Suddenly, survival demands the unthinkable: an alliance with their sworn enemies. Chambers, leading his beleaguered team, must navigate this precarious truce in pursuit of a formidable adversary, one whose power threatens to shift the interstellar balance of power.But cooperation is easier said than done when tensions run high and old grudges die hard. As they chase a threat that weaves through the stars, the line between ally and enemy blurs.In a universe where trust is scarce and betrayal is just one misstep away, can they put aside their differences long enough to avert a cosmic catastrophe?Beyond Honor is a military science fiction series full of action, humor, and mystery. If you're looking for an adventure that starts with a gunfight and ends with galactic consequences, this is the series for you!",

Two units of special forces operatives: the human \u201cZero Unit\u201d and the Arcadian \u201cVanguard\u201d unit meet unexpectedly at the same primitive planet, each with the same mission: retrieve their scientist that had been sent there to observe a primitive society. Things begin to go wrong almost immediately as both teams find themselves working together to save the galaxy as they are being hunted for crimes they did not commit. This book is typical of books written by Daniel Young and the reader should find plenty of action and a fast moving story that will grab hold of the reader and usually includes a cliff hanging plot twist at the end.",

That is what you find out when you read this book ( hint- mayhem!).

Most of the action takes place planet-side, where most of the evil resides.",
