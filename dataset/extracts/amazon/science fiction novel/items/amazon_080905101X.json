                "reviewText": "I think all of Ray Bradbury's stories are difficult to capture in movies. I think most of them have bombed. It's a shame that a writer that captures the imagination and illustrates it so well can't be translated into movies (so far). However, after reading this graphic novel, I believe Tim Hamilton was able to capture the visual magic of Bradbury's best novel in pictures. My message to younger people who have never read 451 (the book), but are picking up this graphic novel for the first time, need to read the book! Although this graphic novel is brilliant and works wonderfully as a graphic novel, it is abridged from the book. Since the whole subject of 451 is about the value of a book and it's ideas, the graphic novel should never replace the book, only add to its color and life! Have fun leafing through the pages of this great graphic version of 451!",

                "reviewText": "Until i read this book in my 11th grade english class just 2 years ago, I HATED READING! When this book was assigned i expected to read the first 2 or 3 pages and then skim the rest of the book for answers to the questions. 2 pages turned into 3, 3 pages turned into 4, and 4 pages turned into the back cover. This book is perfect for this time period. In a world where we cant even trust anything our government(s) tell us, this book really opens your eyes. It is amazing to me how Bradbury wrote this in the 1950's as a Sci-Fic novel and it has basically become a biography of our time period. I guarentee you that 1.) when you start reading this book you will not want to put it down, and 2.) after you finish it, you will never look at the world the same way again.",

                "reviewText": "This is a fine example of how classic science fiction should be adapted into graphic form. Tim Hamilton's artwork manages to convey the dreary minimalism of Bradbury's nightmare world, without itself being both drab and prosaic. He is smart enough to leave large chunks of Bradbury's poetic dialogue raw and intact, while the artwork is so detailed as to do justice to the authors original lush descriptive language. I wish Tim Hamilton would do a whole slew of Bradbury adaptations along with some of the other sci-fi greats, yet I'm sure he has his reasons for not doing so.A superb story with a profound message, which can be enjoyed on many levels. I think any fan of the novel, would be pleasantly surprised by how lovingly and faithfully Tim Hamilton has reformed this master work into the graphic medium. Sublime and highly recommended.",
