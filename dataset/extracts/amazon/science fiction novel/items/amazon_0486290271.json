                "reviewText": "Well, my, my, my what do we have here? This great horror classic was recommended to me by Kindle Unlimited. I was astounded to learn they have a whole classic horror book section, many of which I\u2019ve been dying to read, but didn\u2019t want to pay the absorbent price. This is an avid reader\u2019s dream come true. Yay, Me!As I was reading the synopsis of The Island of Dr. Moreau, I immediately thought of another favorite franchise of mine, Jurassic Park. And what was more unbelievable is this novel was written well over a hundred and twenty years ago, and yet, the author was so ahead of his time and, dare I say it, pretty spot on. This caused me to shudder.Shipwrecked Edward Prendick happened upon a boat that saved his life. But almost immediately, he noticed something strange about the men who was assisting him from the wreckage. These men sort of looked human and sort of looked animal like at the same time. Well, how can that be?One gentleman, if you can call him that, looked ape-like and spoke some English but not as well as Prendick felt he should. Once he got to the island, he soon realized that a very infamous doctor he\u2019d read about just so happened to be on the same island that has now become Prendick\u2019s savior, or was it? After proper introductions, Prendick immediately heard the cries of what sounded like an animal in distress or was that a man in distress? He didn\u2019t know which, but no matter, the sound terrified him and he wanted to know more.As he began exploring the island, Dr. Moreau\u2019s assistant, Montgomery, warned him that he might not want to go exploring by himself for he may stumble across some things that he may not understand, which for Prendick was a huge understatement having seen animals that were human. But his eyes must be deceiving him, right?Once Prendick discovered the secrets of Dr. Moreau\u2019s Island, it became abundantly clear that Dr. Moreau took some creative licenses with his scientific studies a bit too far and Prendick realized that his life was in great danger.OMG! I haven\u2019t had a horror book that scared me that terribly since The Exorcist. My heart was pounding so hard and I stopped breathing as Prendick was running for his life. I felt like I was in a race. This classic was everything and more! I loved all the fear I experienced in reading it. Wow! It\u2019s so terrifying knowing what science can actually do and when it falls into the wrong hands, you can have an island like the one Dr. Moreau created.",

Of all his stories, I found this one to be intriguing and interesting, mainly because it asked the question of what happens when you try to play God.With a mixture of the mythological chimera and Mary Shelley's _Frankenstein_, this story dives into a theory of what would happen if a person tried to \"civilize\" wild animals.In all, great book; can't wait to read more of Wells' work",

                "reviewText": "I believe this is one of the more shocking and disturbing classic novels I have read, and I could see how this would have created a big stir and been a huge source of controversy in its time. Among other things, to me this novel taps far more into the horror genre (than the science fiction realm) in some of its grotesqueness and repulsiveness.I\u2019m sure many are well versed with the basis of the novel. Edward Pendrick, our narrator, is saved and picked up on a boat and ultimately taken to an island. Something seems a bit unusual about some of the inhabitants, and it does not take him long to realize that a man, Dr. Moreau is participating in rather ungodly and barbaric experiments, using animals to create a human-like creature.I think one of the telling points is that Pendrick begins to see through Moreau\u2019s awfulness and cruelty of putting the animals through his reckless endeavors:\u201cNow they stumbled in the shackles of humanity, lived in a fear that never died, fretted by a law they could not understand; their mock-human existence, begun in an agony, was one long internal struggle, one long dread of Moreau\u2014and for what? It was the wantonness of it that stirred me.\u201dFrom a moralistic standpoint, however, I think Wells is making a case about meddling with science, with nature and technology, and how it can lead to immorality and have disastrous, chaotic results. We see this in Dr. Moreau, who is akin to a Victor Frankenstein with his God-complex in following through with his plans at all costs.Above all, this is a cautionary tale that has a disturbing, haunting lesson and will leave the reader contemplating. I have heard there are a couple of film renditions of this (\u201cThe Island of Lost Souls\u201d (1932), \u201cThe Island of Dr. Moreau\u201d (1977), and \u201cThe Island of Dr. Moreau (1996), with the 1932 version being the closest to the novel). I might check them out.Four disturbing stars.",

                "reviewText": "So many novels by H.G. Wells have passed into the collective consciousness of the West that it is difficult to talk about a book such as this. Of course, everyone knows about \"The Island of Doctor Moreau\" and the strange experiments and vivisection, making animals more human. Yet, this book is so much more than that. It is a truly terrifying novel about what man can sink to, Doctor Moreau taking on the personage of a sadistic \"god\" among the Beast People, implanting a law in their genetics and whipping them for breaking it, and yet, he himself is mortal. It is all for nothing in the end, only satisfying his selfish need for power.",

                "reviewTitle": "Shockingly good and thought provoking",
                "reviewText": "I have never thought a horror story might shock me but this little novella from Mr Wells has shocked me quite a bit. When Doctor Moreau is experimenting pain treatment on the puma next door behind which the shrieking and howling disturbs the main character Mr Prendick, I also feel discomposed. Such creeping effect is extremely powerful even after a lengthened gap of more than one hundred years.Despite its nightmarish depiction, the work itself cries out to the reader that it is very good. Right from the first page, its setting reminds me of Robinson Crusoe as island fiction, except it is an even richer story in which man tries to be god and creates monsters that in the end haunts the ungodly master. Shocking but never shallow!I must say, Mr Wells is a genius, mastering several genres with perfection. His Time Machine is a sci-fi work. But his range is wide enough to cover the Gothic and the fantasical: The Island of Doctor Moreau is a Gothic story with a moral; his First Men in the Moon is a fantasy. He is not just a sci-fi writer; he is an imaginative prophet.I am very pleased with this OUP edition with the introduction by D. Jones. The suggestion of degeneration in the late Victorian times is implicitly linked with the sexual orientation of Oscar Wilde is very revealing about contemporary reception of the work. Of course with the benefit of hindsight, modern readers can say such alarm was rather mis-attributed. But given the fact that Darwin's idea and its implications greatly disturbs the Victorians, it is hardly the case that Victorians might think otherwise.The introduction is also very informative as well. If the editor did not mention the set-up of Royal Society of Prevention of Cruelty against Animals, I would not have been aware that the impending 200th anniversary of RSPCA and how humanity has made the leap forward.",
