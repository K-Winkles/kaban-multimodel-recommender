        "description": "To save the Earth, they must first land on the Red Planet.Mars. The next frontier. When people talk about the Red Planet and human salvation, they talk about colonization [transference] \u2013 as if that is mankind\u2019s only hope of surviving the ecological threats facing Earth. But they are wrong. The answer doesn\u2019t lie in moving humanity across the stars to settle its red soil.Rather, it is the Red Planet\u2019s gold.An astronomical discovery on the precipice of global calamity has set two scientists on the path to human salvation. Using their newfound knowledge, they are certain they can utilize Martian resources to solve Earth\u2019s greenhouse crisis and spare the planet \u2013 and humankind along with it. But reaching Mars proves to be just one obstacle out of many, and their time is running out.Will their resourcefulness be enough to save the planet, or are the odds stacked too high against them for mankind to survive?

Amazing technological advances would take place, if only the laws of physics weren\u2019t absolute. If only!Now move forward with that thought and develop the exact technology required to make those laws NOT absolute. Each advancement achieved by manipulating the laws of physics would, in and of itself, make the NEXT achievement, previously known to be impossible, possible.Building on the knowledge of each new discovery, nothing would impossible, just not yet realized. Like I said in the title, knowing a thing is not the same as understanding a thing.Follow the author on a \u201chard science\u201d journey to achieve that which we currently believe to be impossible. Watch YOUR imagination take flight with trips to the moon in less than a day, trips to Mars in a week (currently takes about 13 months). Near light speed travel makes Star Trek, less of a fantasy and more of a possibility. Where will your imagination take you? Theirs took these two young Israeli men to the stars and rich beyond their wildest dreams. And the got the girls too.",

                "reviewText": "I am trying to remember ever seeing a book so immersed in describing global warming and its consequences. Just like the author says, we all know what it means and what will happen, but we are doing our own things, occupying our minds with something else. This book will awaken your minds to the matter.\u201cSometimes we hear on the news that global temperatures will rise by a single degree over twenty years. Usually, when I hear this, I tell myself: \u2018one degree? That is not terrible, I can barely feel one degree.\u2019 Do you know how much energy a single global degree represents?\u201d Adam asked, answering his own question after a brief pause. \u201cThat energy is equivalent to 400 million atomic bombs13 such as the one the United States dropped on Hiroshima. Not one bomb, not a thousand bombs, not a million bombs and not one hundred million bombs \u2014 four hundred million atomic bombs.\u201d\u201cWe humans,\u201d added Nadav, \u201ccan\u2019t really grasp such huge numbers. It is perhaps easier to understand this figure in a different way: a single degree rise in global temperature is like dropping an atomic bomb for every twenty people living in the world today.\u201dI had to place this quote here because it had the biggest impact on me. It's from a conversation the characters are having about saving the world with their invention. They have a powerful technology in their hands and they can get a Nobel prize for it, but instead, they decide not to share it. They want to make a company and use the technology to go to the Moon for some material that can produce green energy that will not add to global warming. They have a means of space travel and all they think about is how to save to world.I like how it's all detailed and scientifically explained.",
