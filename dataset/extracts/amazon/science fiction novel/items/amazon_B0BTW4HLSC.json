I loved Wakeless when I read it last year, so I was excited to jump in to this series. Nightshade is set in a world where human trade between countries exist for survival. Brie is sent away from her family to a country called Castra - once she arrives, something is just wrong and a nightmare begins as she becomes one of the research subjects.The writing was tremendously thrilling and immersive. with the description of the women\u2019s living conditions and effects from the trial, being so well written that I felt I was there slipping and sliding among the chaos and bodily fluids. I couldn\u2019t turn the pages fast enough. The characters had my heart and I was completely immersed in their story line.I have been meaning to read more dystopian novels and this certainly was one of the best I have read this year. I cannot wait to read Book Two Hemlock and Book Three, Bloodroot.I encourage you to pick up this series to support an amazing talent in this genre. it was simply an entertaining read that read like a movie to me.",

The story follows Brie, a naive 19-year-old who is traded to the horrific new nation of Castra. The plot is gripping and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. What I enjoyed most about this book was the character development. Brie starts off as a sheltered and innocent young woman, but as she navigates through the horrors of Castra, she begins to develop a sense of strength and resilience. The friendships she forms along the way help sustain her and add an element of hope to the story.The ending of the book was a cliffhanger that left me wanting more. I couldn't wait to get my hands on book 2 and find out what happens next! Overall, Nightshade is a fantastic start to the Castra Project series and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys dystopian novels.",

                "reviewText": "There\u2019s nothing as exciting as adding an author to your auto-buy list and that\u2019s what happened after reading my second book from Lisa Johnston. She has a knack for creating characters to root for and very disturbing dystopian worlds. And I\u2019m all in!!In the first book of The Castra Project, Nightshade, North America is no more. Nations have sprung up and each relies on trade between them to survive. This trade includes humans who must give up 10 years of their lives as laborers so their home nation can receive the goods they need for their families to exist.Brie is \u201ctraded\u201d to the new nation of Castra which is so secretive, she has no idea what to expect. When Brie arrives, she finds out she\u2019s now living in a nightmare as she and the women she arrives with become test subjects for the Project.I loved Brie\u2019s character along with Heidi, who becomes her best friend. Even Lola, Brie\u2019s group-mate, is an \u201cinteresting\u201d character.Make no bones about it, Nightshade can be brutal at times and very hard to read. But I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about this world that Johnston created and had to know more.If you like adult dystopian thrillers, then you need to pick this book up. (Nightshade is available on Kindle Unlimited.) While reading I felt vibes of Hunger Games, but more so because of Brie\u2019s character.Nightshade\u2019s ending sets up to continue Brie\u2019s story in book two, Hemlock, and I can\u2019t wait. I need more! Hemlock releases in May so thank goodness the wait is not long!*Thank you so much to the author for providing a copy of this intriguing book!*",

I love her writing style; it doesn't get in the way of telling the story, which you will find compelling you onward to the next twists and turns of the plot.
