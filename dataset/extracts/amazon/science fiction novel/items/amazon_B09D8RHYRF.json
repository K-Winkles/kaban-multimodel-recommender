Mari\u2019s only hope for freedom is to be granted asylum from the leaders of the powerful Star Kingdom. First, she must prove that she has knowledge and resources she can offer them.

                "reviewText": "While I do not usually write book reviews, I greatly enjoyed the original series and had hoped that she would write more and while I primarily enjoyed Casmir and his Crusher and would still enjoy more novels featuring him the new characters are Quite interesting and enjoyable along with much more humor. The main event really is not hard to figure out but is also fun. I assume that Kay will be the new Zee. There was a surprising twist in the story involving DNA. While the story was very different from what I expected I was not disappointed. I would highly recommend her SciFi books and while her Fantasy books are surely well written as well for personal and religious reasons I will never buy any of them. My original introduction to this author thru her Fallen empire series and woul love to read more of that series with the original characters rather than the children although those books are very good I really enjoyed the cyborg and mouthy pilot. I would buy any books on their further adventures. So excellent books the author has an amazing vocabulary it is exceedingly rare for me to read books that have words that I am unfamiliar with not that there is enough of that to interfere with one's enjoyment of her books. Please write more.",
