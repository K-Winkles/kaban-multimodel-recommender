                "reviewText": "In \u201cFrank Herbert\u2019s Dune: The Graphic Novel Adaptation, Book 1,\u201d Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson set out to adapt the text in a visual format as faithfully as possible, featuring art by Ra\u00fal All\u00e9n and Patricia Mart\u00edn with a cover by Bill Sienkiewicz, who did the art for the Marvel Comics adaptation of David Lynch\u2019s 1984 adaptation of \u201cDune.\u201d Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson write in their preface, \u201cWe weren\u2019t interested in doing our interpretation of \u2018Dune\u2019 or modifying the story to add our own special stamps. We wanted this to be pure \u2018Dune\u2019 \u2013 chapter for chapter, scene for scene\u2026 Because the original novel is broken into three \u201cbooks,\u201d the graphic novel will be released in three separate volumes\u2026 We kept a watchful eye on the \u2018Dune\u2019 canon that Frank Herbert laid out, and made certain that the art matched the vision he had for his incredible universe.\u201d They succeed in faithfully adapting Herbert\u2019s novel with the only significant change occurring near the end as a way to foreshadow events that will occur in the subsequent two volumes. All\u00e9n and Mart\u00edn\u2019s art beautifully compliments the story, with stunning colors evoking the underlying emotion and settings of each scene. Their portrayal of the sandworms of Arrakis are particularly stunning. Fans of \u201cDune\u201d will find this a beautiful companion to the novel.",

                "reviewText": "To those who found themselves drawn into the cosmic universe of DUNE, guided by the visual enchantments of the 2021 filmic translation, this critique is your guiding star. My recollections of the previous cinematic endeavors and series are but distant mirages, shapes forming and fading in the vast desert of memory.The recent film, a luminous spectacle, gripped my senses with an unrelenting intensity. Every frame, a meticulously crafted tableau, seemed capable of assuming a cherished position upon one's walls, a captured moment of grandeur and visual poetry. As a frequent voyager through the realms of graphic novels that eschew the trappings of superhuman protagonist, I felt a compelling allure towards this medium of DUNE.This novel, sketched and inked, draws its inspiration more heavily from Herbert's original literary masterpiece, although the tones that it strikes seem, perhaps, less steeped in the brooding depths of maturity. Yet, there is an elusive charm about it, a refreshing energy that manifests in every inked line and coloured panel.This graphic rendering, therefore, deserves a place in your collection, although one must warn not to anticipate the ethereal ambience of the film. It is a beast of different colors and contours, a creature born of ink and paper rather than light and shadow. It aligns itself more closely with the sand-scoured landscapes of the book, inviting you to experience DUNE in yet another richly textured iteration. Thus, venture forth and embrace this interpretation, my fellow wanderers in the desolate yet captivating universe of DUNE.",

But as I flipped through the supurbly illustrated cells, I quickly came to appreciate the beauty of Graphic Novels. The moments captured in the cells were expertly chosen, conveying the important parts of the story in a cohesive and flowing way; I have no idea how they were able to chose the right scenes from such a packed novel as Dune and tell the story so well.I will be getting the next in the series.Well done! To those involved in the making of this graphic novel, and thank you for putting me on to a new genre. I'll be exploring many more.",

I really enjoyed this read and the graphics are pretty cool also. The cover and pages feel great in my hand as I read this. The dust jacket is stunning (front and back) as is the image of the sandworm. I recommend this for any Dune fan to have as part of their collection. I\u2019m so glad I have this. I love it!",

However, i wish it was stylistically more closely related to Denis Villeneuve's 2021 Dune (in more that just the DUNE title font) because i really like some of his choices such as the brave casting of Liet Kynes as a black woman. But other than that, it's great! Too bad that part 2 wont be out until Spring of 2022, though!",
