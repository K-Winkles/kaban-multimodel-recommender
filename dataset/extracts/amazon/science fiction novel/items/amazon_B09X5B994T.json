                "reviewText": "Mindwalker has the perfect sci-fi blend of being action packed and fun, while still having some (hence the name I guess) mind-bending technology themes that sent my brain spiralling. If I'm honest the first few chapters gave me the illusion that the book was mostly just going to be a fun romp, but by the end I was reeling from the thematic development which touched on autonomy, mind control, propaganda, conspiracy and free-will.That's not to say the story is a staid preachy affair, there are plenty of explosions and Goddam Dylan did not hold back with some of the action - I did think this book would make an awesome movie, but possibly with an R rating!Now normally with series or potential series I don't really like the trope of book one being a tight action story and then the World Building gets expanded the author gets to bore me to death with later books, but I am BEGGING for this world to be expanded on in later books, there is so much to be built on and this trope is exactly what I want to happen. Mindwalker is a fairly tight affair in terms of world-building, there's just enough exposition to make the world 'pop' but I'm keen for more. In conclusion this book is great, sci-fi is great, mind-control is scary , Ryder Stone is possibly the biggest block of cheese name in YA, but we can't all be perfect - Read this book!!",

The story held me and forced me to drop my plans and read it. So yeah. If you want to spend a day jumping into a thrill-ride of a story this is the books for you.

                "reviewText": "\u201cDo not let them rule you.Do not let them own you.Do not surrender control.\u201dThis was one of my Goldsboro subscription books and honestly when I first saw that this was a selection, I was a little apprehensive. I don\u2019t read a lot of YA anymore and have become very selective of the few I do pick up, and I had never heard of this book. I read the synopsis and early reviews were pretty good, so I decided to give it a go and I really was surprised by how much I enjoyed this.This is a sci-fi novel about this young girl named Sil Sarrah and she works for this company called Syntex. They have a program called the Walker program where young people are fitted with these devices in their heads that allow them to take over certain people\u2019s minds and help them survive on missions. Sil is the best Walker that Syntex has seen in a while, she\u2019s never lost a person and she plans to keep it that way.However, a mission ends up going left and she is now being accused of going rogue and being a spy. Now the organization that she\u2019s given so much of her life to is after her and she is forced to flee the only place she has known for 10 years. Desperate to clear her name, she infiltrates this secret agency whose whole mission is to tear down Syntex. While there, she learns things that bring everything she has been taught into question.I really enjoyed Sil as the main character. She feels young, because she is, but she actually was really quick witted and had a lot of intelligence for a character so young. She made pretty sound decisions and she was fearless, which is something I like to see in these types of novels. You could also see how much she cared about her friends and despite certain things unfolding, she always thought of them and tried to protect them.While this is YA, I think this has great crossover appeal. There is a bit of a quick romance that develops, but I didn\u2019t think it was too bad and I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s instalove. I actually was okay with the relationship. It doesn\u2019t take over the story, but it is there for people who like that in their stories and I was lowkey rooting for the couple. I liked them together and I love how the author handled this in the end, it was very realistic and is not something I see often in YA.The best part of this book is the world building and the technology, which are my favorite parts of sci-fi stories. The Walker program that Syntex has created is actually brilliant when thinking of it purely from a technology standpoint. The way people have the ability to enter other people\u2019s minds and help them survive dangerous missions is something that I could see coming in handy in very specific situations, but overall it leads to some pretty big ethical issues and questions. The biggest problem is when it comes to consent and how consent is thrown out the window when a company has the ability to enter your mind and how they may not always have permission to do that. I can\u2019t talk too much about this without getting into spoilers, but I loved the conversations this book was having.The book was also discussing how a lot of big businesses, especially ones that create technology, get away with doing a lot of bad stuff with little to no repercussions. It\u2019s also difficult because in this world that Dylan has created, there are some great things that technology has given them, things that even save people lives, but there is always a downside to technological advance and that\u2019s mostly how the people at the top will find a way to exploit it and it almost always affects those on the bottom rungs of society.The other way this book deals with consent is how it deals with how a company like Syntex gets \u201cconsent\u201d from these young kids to be apart of this Walker program. It\u2019s important to note that Walkers don\u2019t have a long life expectancy, they normally don\u2019t live past the age of 19. Laws have been created in this world so that kids can give consent, meaning they don\u2019t need their parents permission to get a dangerous device that kills them by 19 implanted in their brains.I found the story itself really exciting. By the time we got to the end of the story, I was so invested and there were a couple of moments that genuinely shocked me, moments I didn\u2019t see coming at all. I do wish the very end of the book was a bit more dynamic, but overall, this was a super strong book and I\u2019m definitely going to be keeping my eye on Dylan for any future releases.\u201cFor better or worse, I\u2019m living the final act of the future I chose. The legacy I chose. Now I just have to make it count for something.\u201dCW for death, violence, and graphic medical descriptions.",

Initially the gorgeous cover pulled me in when I saw a reel on Bookstagram, so I read the blurb and made an impulse purchase there and then. I have zero regrets!I loved Sil, she is the selfless heroine who wants to do right for her family, friends and the world. Ryder is the intriguing rogue who shows her a new perspective and sparks fly.I would say this book is YA in the romance department, there are intense feelings but the sexy scenes are fade to black with the details.A fantastic debut book all in all as it gave me THE FEELING. The one where I need to read it as quick as possible because it\u2019s so good but I also don\u2019t want it to end!",
