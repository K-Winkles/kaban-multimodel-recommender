                "reviewText": "Carpathians\" is a remarkably good early novel. The world building is excellent, the characters much more well are eloped than the ordinary sci-fy novel, and the plot is both intricate and multi-facited . it takes us all over the universe from Earth to various corporate-run area of space to a snowball planet to dead moons. The six or so characters get about equal time, as the story line shifts from one to the other, Dixon has a way with dramatic tension and he is not afraid to kill off major characters. The ending of this novel seems a bit rushed, bittersweet, and ambiguous. Will Dr. Nya and Johanna be reunited? Will Lester and Per be reunited? Will the Carpathian get out of hostile space? Will Lester turn to the dark side? What will happen to the artifact? Insuring minds are left up in the air. Expect a sequel.",

Deeply developed characters, fascinating science, gorgeous world-building and even a tidbit of romance. But I'll never again be able to look at a centipede without a shiver down the spine. I was disappointed to learn that this is the author's only sci-fi novel. (He has a couple of fantasy books but I'm allergic to that genre.) Give us more, Mr. Dixon.",

The overall feel, to me, is that it has elements of Hyperion, Blindsight, and Dune - three of my all-time favorites. Hyperion because it throws together a varied group of extraordinary people traveling to solve a mystery of cosmic importance, Blindsight because some of them are truly extraordinary pushing the boundaries of being human, Dune because, well, Dune covered pretty much all cool things so it's hard not to be influenced by it.I don't claim the writing as as good in a literary sense as those three classics - few are. But it is not clunky at all and reads very well. The plot is deep with many facets, but not impossible to follow like some others.An overall excellent space romp.",
