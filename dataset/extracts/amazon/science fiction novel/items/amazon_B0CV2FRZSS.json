I enjoy where she's taking the story and now I can't wait for the next one.I appreciate that each installment is a new and complete story on it's own. I started the series with Aydarr and I have literally been hooked. The character development has been superb and the plots gripping. I started this book earlier today and was reading it on my Kindle on my laptop in between my conferences all day. I couldn't wait to get home to sink my teeth into the meat of the world to see how it all turned out. I was not disappointed. I'm here basking in the sheer pleasure of the experience and thinking, not for the first time, that this would make an excellent series on Netflix. I could see myself binge watching Season after Season. Move over Bridgerton. Badari is here.You lobbed the ball out of the park on this one, Ms Scott. Kudos to you and your Muse. I eagerly await what comes next.",

All I needed to know was that it was the next book in the Badari series. Veronica Scott added the prophecy of the goddess seamlessly into the story. Yeah, I know it's her story she could take it anywhere, but sometimes when you write a storyline the characters can change and that changes everything. So either the goddess got her prophecy right or the author went back after the end and placed the prophecy according to how the story ended, clever!",
