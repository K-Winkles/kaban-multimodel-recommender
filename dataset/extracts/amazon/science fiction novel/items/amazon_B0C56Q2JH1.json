                "reviewText": "I am blown away by this collection. The stories have a common theme, a thread weaving through each of them, but yet they are varied in style, genre, voice and format. Ingenious storytelling. These stories bring alive different possibilities and futures, both dark and beautiful, with advanced technology and traditional African culture and traditions intertwined.Each of these stories gave me something. Some of the stories were longer and thus more fleshed out and intricate. The shorter stories gave you glimpses into different realities, but still managed to leave their mark on you, often in a profound way. The collection awoke feelings of unease, horror, anger, love, helplessness and compassion. But it was also full of insightful ideas and lines that really stuck with me. Some that reflect the more general way of the world and some very personal.I especially enjoyed the unique story formats of \u201cComments on Your Provisional Patent Application for an Eternal Spirit Core\u201d and \u201cAbeokuta52\u201d. It\u2019s inspiring how Talabi manages to convey a whole world, intricate characters and a moving story in formats such as a blog post + comments and a patent application form.I genuinely cannot pick a favourite out of these 16 stories. They all speak to me and move me in some way. I am so happy I was drawn to this book by its gorgeous cover and interesting blurb. I will be rereading these stories over and over.Arc review",

Almost every story holds a thread of grief, loss, transition, and Hope.I enjoyed that the author played with narrative style and a couple of the stories: One is a chat post with replies one is a patent application and one breaks up a traditional Nigerian folktale with a corollary in the future present.I also appreciated the author notes at the end of the book for each of the short stories. I found them fascinating, because they gave a glimpse into the author's writing process.I'm definitely going to be picking up a copy for myself because I will be revisiting some of these stories.People who like afrofuturism, Black speculative fiction are probably going to like this book.Thank you Net Galley and Daw books for my advanced reader copy. Thoughts are my own and as unbiased as I can make them.",

                "reviewText": "Initially, I was making a list of my favorite stories so that I could name the standout entries. All anthologies have some stories I like more and some I like less, but here's the thing... a list of the stories that were 5-star entries for me would pretty closely resemble the table of contents. This whole collection is really strong, and it's an easy five stars from me.Not only was each piece quite solid, they worked well together. They vary pretty widely in length, too. \"Lights in the Sky\" is an excellent flash fiction, \"Tend to Zero\" is a fantastic mid-length piece with notes of NK Jemisin's stories of cities personified, and the novella at the core of this book, while not my favorite piece, touched on many of the larger themes that cropped up in the other pieces. Some stories have a more fantastical bent, others are classic scifi, and all of them have Afrofuturist components that would make this book a good fit for fans of Nnedi Okorafor and Tlotlo Tsamaase's utopias-turned-dystopian.Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for the ARC of this book. I'm looking forward to reading Talabi's entry in Africa Risen when I read it sometime later this year. Definitely going to pick up more of his work in the future!",
