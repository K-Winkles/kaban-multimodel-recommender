Meet Jacob Mooreland, Prepper, Homesteader, and Combat Veteran, as he fights to save his family and farm from a Catastrophic Global Societal Collapse. Jacob, Former Army Ranger, and His Beautiful Wife Ana, the fierce daughter of a Croatian Sniper, have prepared their family for every contingency. Or have they?? Jacob and Ana are masters of self-reliance and experts of both off grid survival homesteading and self-defense. Their intriguing global connections grant them an inside look at the sinister geopolitical maneuvers behind the calamitous events and a first row seat to observe the seismic forces of this terrifyingly plausible scenario. See how they fend off one disaster after the next as they witness the perfect storm of the Global Collapse.",

                "reviewText": "The author places the reader in the moment like an observer who is actually present in every moment of the story. What a movie this would make. Having read many apocalyptic and survival books I can say this was the best I\u2019ve encountered. In a lot of books the characters are not well defined early on so you don\u2019t connect as well as you do with this reading. The detail for each character is intense and you feel as if you know them personally. I noted particularly the emotions and mental calculation going on in his brain as a long serving Veteran myself as he encounters each situation. It was easy to think in tandem with him and reach the same understandings and action I would have taken. Saeclum is a well designed and engineered book that helps a new to apocalypse and even an old veteran feel the need to be more prepared especially in this broken world we live in today. To quote an old military motto, Semper Paratus, which means Always Ready, is an ever important thing to do. We live in troubled times, take heed.",

I especially enjoyed that there was no unnecessary use of profanity or violence for the sake of violence. When an action of violence is used you understand why and the ramifications of that action. Many many good things to say about this book and author. I only have one complaint\u2026 I can\u2019t wait to read book 2. Well I guess that isn\u2019t a complaint as much as it is an encouragement for the writing of the next book. AATW! RLTW!",
