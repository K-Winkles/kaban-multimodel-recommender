        "description": "In this riveting, stand-alone novel from Michael Mammay, author of Planetside, the beginning of a new human colony must face tyrannical leaders, revolution, crippling instability, and an unknown alien planet that could easily destroy them all.In 2108, Colony Ship Voyager departed Earth for the planet of Promissa with 18,000 of the world\u2019s best and brightest on board. 250 years and 27 light years later, an arrival is imminent.But all is not well.The probes that they\u2019ve sent ahead to gather the data needed to establish any kind of settlement aren\u2019t responding, and the information they have received has presented more questions than answers. It\u2019s a time when the entire crew should be coming together to solve the problem, but science officer Sheila Jackson can\u2019t get people to listen.With the finish line in sight, a group of crewmembers want an end to the draconian rules that their forebearers put in place generations before. However, security force officer Mark Rector and his department have different plans. As alliances form and fall, Governor Jared Pantel sees only one way to bring Voyager\u2019s citizens together and secure his own power: a full-scale colonization effort. Yet, he may have underestimated the passion of those working for the other side...Meanwhile, a harsh alien planet awaits that might have its own ideas about being colonized. A battle for control brews, and victory for one group could mean death for them all.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been a fan of Michael Mammay since his first book came out, so when I got an opportunity to read a pre-release copy of his latest novel Generation Ship I jumped at the chance. It\u2019s a great read and I\u2019m proud to recommend it to all fans of hard science fiction.The story is simple \u2013 the good ship Voyager is ending it\u2019s 250+ years-long trip to the Zeta Tucanae system. (This is a real star, 28 light years from Earth.) There is an Earthlike planet called Promissa which the 18,000 humans on the ship plan to colonize. Our story starts 140 days or cycles prior to arrival and it\u2019s not much of a spoiler to say problems have arisen. More like mysteries, as the advance probe sent to the planet has lost contact with Voyager.Mammay\u2019s novels are full of intrigue, and this one is no exception. The five main characters in the book all have very different wants and needs, and those are in conflict with each other. Some just want to have a \u201cnormal\u201d life, however that\u2019s defined on a tightly-packed spaceship, while others have grander visions. How these people interact with each other while solving the larger mystery of Promissa drive this story.There are several things I really like about this book that I want to call out. First, Mammay does a great job of depicting change within stasis. The political system of the ship has evolved over the centuries, but because of the environment, much has stayed the same. Second, Mammay does a great job with character growth. All of the main characters start at one level and evolve, sometimes reluctantly, into another. There are no \u201cchosen ones\u201d or self-selected heroes in this book. Lastly, the mystery of Promissa is well set up. Frankly I would like to have learned more about the planet than I did.I think any fan of hard science fiction would love this novel. Order it now!",

                "reviewText": "Generation Ship by Michael Mammay is a story about a long-haul colony ship to another star system. This is by far the best novel of this type I have ever read. I have read many novels of this type over the years and they all had a common storyline in that the story takes place many years into their journey with many more yet to go. In these stories the technology starts to break down or the crew mutinies or many times both. This novel is different in that the story takes place at the end of the journey with the ship approaching a new world to colonize. The ship's technology has worked remarkably well but as the day of arrival approaches the crew is at odds about how and when to start landing people on the planet. Life is discovered on the planet which further fragments the crew's opinions. This novel is told from several viewpoints and none of them are really bad guys or good guys. They are just people trying to do what they think is best for themselves and those around them. There is much political intrigue in this novel and a fair amount of action also. A truly great read!",

While the Planetside series are roller-coaster rides of action and intrigue, Generation Ship has all of the intrigue, but with deliberate pacing that pulls you into the story.Mammay's use of multiple protagonists gives the reader the dynamic perspective of real life. Combined with a looming countdown calendar, these add subtle tensions to the developing storyline.Beyond science-fiction, this novel is also an excellent political commentary without any judgment. Who am I cheering for? Ultimately, everyone, the stakes are too high not too.",

                "reviewText": "I follow our own space programs rather closely. So I'm hard to please, take that into account when you read the following: This author relies on poetic license, ignoring current capabilities, and some stuff that's been around since the very beginning of the space program, to such a degree it pops me right out of suspended disbelief. Pretty common in sci-fi these days.",

With engaging characters, and a unique plot twist, I can\u2019t say enough good things about it. At least not without spoilers.Highly recommended.",
