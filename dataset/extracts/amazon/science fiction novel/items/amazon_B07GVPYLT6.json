                "reviewText": "Max and the Banjo Ferret is a fun, fast-paced, adventure that closes out (maybe?) the Max and the Multiverse trilogy. Once again Zachry has created a wonderfully crazy story that pits Max, Zoey, Perra, and Ross against nefarious bad guys - in this case the return of Lord Essien (from book 1) and Nifan \"The Dossier\" (and a few other titles I can't post in a family-friendly review). I don't want to say more because, well SPOILERS, but Max and Ross must find a way off of the planet Yankar and reunite with Zoey and Perra (who in this current version of the multiverse don't know who Max is). Hi-jinx and mayhem ensue, there's a lot of things blowing up, and a giant purple ferret. It's a crazy fun ride.For me, the best part of Max and the Banjo Ferret - aside from the might Tim, The Destroyer of Worlds (long live Ferretianism!) - was the Terramesh. This conglomeration of 80 worlds (well, 86 to be exact) bound together by gravity technology nobody seems to really understand creates a wonderful backdrop to the craziness that takes place and makes this story stand up there with greats of science fiction inventiveness like Asimov, Niven, and Heinlein. (No? Well, we can agree to disagree, but certainly a movie based on Max and the Banjo Ferret would rival Valerian or The Fifth Element for visual stunningness (yes, that is a word now).) Also, I love Lord Essien, who takes no (bleep) from anybody and dishes out death and destruction as casually as if flicking lint off of her clothes.I highly recommend Max and the Banjo Ferret, though if you've not read books 1 or 2 in the Max series you need to do that first (it's worth it - and oh, Phil makes a guest appearance in book 3! - I love Phil).",

I\u2019m am a huge fanboy myself after all! If you honestly need the reassurance that Wheeler doesn\u2019t blunder through Max\u2019s third outing, you\u2019ve got my seal of approval.One of the funniest characters has a HUGE reveal in this book. I dare not spoil. I think my heavy handed hints already do enough damage.Plot? Sure. Essian and Niffan struggle against one another and a silly missionary group, among others, to fill the vacuum of evil that our heroes created with their antics in the first two installments. Max just wants to find his way back to Zoey and Petra\u2019s freighter.Wheeler is still the funniest living writer in this big headed reviewer\u2019s opinion, so pay the admission price and ride. I like the Max books so much I\u2019m buying them in glorious paperback. Yup, the old fashioned reading material.",

The further development of the series characters is always fun, too. Just when you think you know them pretty well, you learn something new and VERY different. Fun!!",
