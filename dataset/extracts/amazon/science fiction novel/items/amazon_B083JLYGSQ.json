                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars I enjoyed it a lot despite some huge flaws",
                "reviewText": "This was a very hard book to rate. Truthfully, it probably deserves 3 stars, but I enjoyed the romance between the main character, Gemma, and the alien hero, Simon, so much I bumped it up a star.The TL;DR, spoiler free review is that if you enjoy alien romances between a human female, and a male alien who clearly is culturally different, and have enough word count to really show the growth of affection between the two instead of insta-love/lust, then you'll enjoy this. And if this is the most important thing you're looking for, you can hopefully overlook the vague world building and the horrendous grammar, word choice, and syntax mistakes.However, (and now we get into spoiler territory) the reason this book probably deserves 3 stars is because those flaws are really hard to overlook.The grammar, syntax, and word choice errors are astounding and confusing. And should have been caught by a good editor. For example, there are a few times \"can\" is used instead of \"could\". A few times the author inexplicably jumps into present tense. The author uses words incorrectly. For example, Gemma and many others are called migrants, but they're not. They're refugees. Their homes have been destroyed and they fled to the city (country?) where they now live. Also, once, the author uses the slang term \"peeps\" and it was for the word \"people\". It was such a strange, out of nowhere term to use, not even used in dialogue, and was never used again. The author uses \"weeny\" instead of \"teeny\". These errors really threw me out of the story and I had to reread sentences.Gemma, as a heroine, came off laughably naive at points. She has a horrible life and yet she hasn't become bitter, overwhelmingly depressed, etc. She reminded me of a fairytale heroine, like Snow White or Cinderella, where their main character traits was being doormats but yet still compassionate and kind to everyone. She even sings when she cleans. The way she reacts to the OO sexually assaulting her was mind boggling. The man suddenly outright gripes her breast and she freezes not because of fear or anger but she was curious to see how far he'd go?! What?? As for looks, the thing I know best is that she's extremely thin and yet has huge breasts. The amount of times her huge breasts are mentioned by men or herself was laughable. Also, she was thin from starvation, but her breasts don't shrink? That's not how that works. She also agrees to go with Simon to his home planet with no questions! She doesn't ask about his planet's laws. Would she even be considered autonomous? Does Simon even have a mate and kids back on his planet? Do they practice monogamy or harems or polyamory? We don't know and neither does Gemma. I ask more questions ordering off an Ala Carte menu than Gemma did about her potential new life!Which leads me to the other major flaw. The vague world building. It's strange because on one hand, the author is very good at making prison life come alive, as well as the desperation in Gemma's world. This is obviously an Earth in decline, just after some horrible catastrophe and probably before another one. But what are the rules and parameters of this world? We never know. Where is Gemma exactly, besides Earth? Is she in the US? Is there a US? Is there a government? There's some authority body because people are given prison terms, but we never know by whom. At one point, there's a violent riot in the streets between aliens and humans. The next day, the alien offenders are in jail with prison sentences! That's an insane turn around! Did they even get a trial?Are the aliens citizens? How long has it been since first contact? People seem used to some aliens but not others. Why? If some species of aliens are causing so much unrest by assaulting people on the streets, why are they allowed to come onto the planet at all? None of these questions are answered and there's no way to glean the answer from the book.The highlight of the book, and what enraptured me, was when Gemma and Simon interact. Simon proved an interesting hero. He's an alien, and he IS alien. His culture, morals, and sensibilities are vastly different from humans, so it was great to see him slowly warm to Gemma and finally fall in love with her. Their relationship was really what kept me going, because it's really rare to get a well developed, \"slow burn\" alien romance. For that alone, I recommend this book.I wish we could have gotten more; where we see Gemma arrive at the Rix planet, and her adjustments to her new life, and see her relationship with Simon developed in the new environment. Maybe someday there'll be a sequel.",

I never thought I would enjoy a book that had the MMC not looking human. But Lydia Hope creates Simon and I loved him. I couldn't imagine as I started the book, when he was initially described, ever feeling like I could get into this book. I almost quit but the story and Gemma were compelling enough for me to try and I'm so glad I did. I struggled with the toothless MMC but luckily that was made right later haha. This was such a fun ride. Aliens, danger, risks, adventure...An FMC who was the perfect mix of strength and vulnerability. I had so much fun reading this and am glad I saw this recommended.Random side note...how are we going to talk about Gemma's eyes being Grey but the cover shows a woman with brown eyes?",

It's obvious that the book was not proofread. It's also obvious that spell check was used. But spell check doesn't catch homophones (words that sound alike but have different spellings and meanings) like using \"taught\" when it's obvious it's \"taut\". Then there were writing errors where the sentence would be about the female character but in a compound sentence, the pronoun \"her\" mysteriously shifts to \"him\". Arrrrgh! These sorts of mistakes make me crazy. They're extremely distracting and interrupt the flow of my reading. Not to mention I have to stop and figure out what the author really meant.I normally overlook a few simple errors but I took two stars off for bad or no proofing. It's too bad because this is an otherwise GREAT STORY! I'm bored with alien romances but this is in a category of its own.",

I mean, there is not even the words \u201cThe End\u201d written nor is there any afterword from the author! Could it be that it\u2019s incomplete? Will read the next plot of the same world, I hope to find answers there.",

                "reviewText": "Let me preface this review by saying at one point I got so excited reading this book I accidentally punched the wall beside me and gained a decent bruise. It was beyond worth it.I\u2019m completely awed by Lydia Hope\u2019s ability to create complex and truly *alien* characters, which goes far beyond what I ever expected. Gemma and Simon\u2019s interactions were alternating enchanting, surreal, heartwarming, and even at times mildly disturbing. How well the Rix species was portrayed as not only physically different but also emotionally and morally different from humans was endlessly fascinating and you can tell a lot of thought went into everything involved.Truly my only complaint is wishing for some sort of epilogue. I wanted so badly to see how the characters end up after the events of the story. Though is it really a complaint if I\u2019m just wishing for MORE?Now I\u2019ll just eagerly dream of what adventures, species, and characters the author will gift us with next \ud83d\udc95",

Ce livre m'a tenue \u00e9veill\u00e9e tard dans la nuit et m'a appel\u00e9e aux petites heures du jour tellement j'avais h\u00e2te de conna\u00eetre la suite.Pas de chichis, l'histoire n'est pas forc\u00e9e mais s'\u00e9coule naturellement, les personnages sont attachants, m\u00eame les plus insignifiants sont int\u00e9ressants.Gemma et Simon sont un couple tellement fort.Gemma est fragile, d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9e, pas taill\u00e9e pour survivre sur cette Terre \u00e0 l'agonie. Simon n'est plus qu'une coguille vide, avec la mort pour seul horizon, lorsqu'ils se rencontrent. Mais peu \u00e0 peu ils vont reprendre vie l'un et l'autre, nous tenant en haleine jusqu'\u00e0 la derni\u00e8re page.J'ai h\u00e2te de decouvrir le prochain tome, une autre histoire, mais je fais confiance \u00e0 l'auteure.",
