                "reviewText": "So, I\u2019m currently re-reading my way through the Risdaverse, and I read this book first even though this wasn\u2019t published, I think, until we were a few, maybe four, books into the series. This was part of another author\u2019s collaboration series Ruby did. That is why you may come across two or three other authors that use the same book cover, but have the dress in a different color.That is also why the name doesn\u2019t match up with the others. It\u2019s part of the \u201cPretty\u2026\u201d series as well as the \u201cRisdaverse\u201d. But if you have gotten this far, you should already know that the naming convention has already been disrupted. Even though it can still be considered a standalone, our real first visit to Risda III is in the Prison Barbarian book.So is this book worth the 2 hour read? I\u2019m sure some of you can polish it off in an hour, and others like me will take a day. But is it worth it? Yes, but only because you meet them again in at least one of the other Risdaverse books. I\u2019m pretty sure that is when Ruby got requests for a story about how they got together and all that.Thanks to the Corsairs we know that even off Not-Hoth the blue guys do suffer from love at first sight when they come across their mates. Personally I think Ruby didn\u2019t want to let that plot point go after living on Not-Hoth for so long and it\u2019s her world she\u2019s creating. So the blue guys fall hard and instantly for their true mates.I like how they met, but because this book was just a novella and most likely shoehorned in between other projects and books, she jumps in time twice and places some events further along than one might expect. The whole story takes place over six weeks but we are only treated to maybe 4 days out of all that time.This story can totally be expanded upon, by someone, but even as this quick little read, it\u2019s an ok story that gives you background on the couple and how the Risdaverse came to be in the first place. Which is why I read it first. \ud83d\ude01",

                "reviewText": "It was OK I guess, I mean what there was to it...This is short as you expect a novella to be ,but there really isn\u2019tmuch here...For some off reason I want to you the word \u201cintense\u201d when I use the word short...You know ,like \u201cshort and intense\u201d or \u201c short but intense\u201d, butt intense isn\u2019t the right word here ,sparse is.There\u2019s not much here.Possibly \u26a0\ufe0f spoilers \u26a0\ufe0fVarrik and Milly meet after the horrid hostess of the month long party he\u2019s at her estate to attend ,shows him Milly thru a one way window as the \u201ctoy\u201d she\u2019s gotten a \u201c debauched\u201d Lord who has a fetish for \u201calien flesh\u201d.Varrik who has taken an instant liking to her ( of course ) demands she be given to him), used to being obeyed ,he is.They barely spend one night observing each our and light chit chat,when trying \u201cto fit in\u201d Milly drinks too much wine she hates,and Varrik tucks her into his bed and sleeps in a chair.Milly wakes to this sight and even though she doesn\u2019t want to upset him and wants to be a \u201cgood lil slave\u201d ,she does the dumbest thing any of us can do. She assumes.We see her pointless and rather uninteresting jaunt thru the huge mansion/manor passed from one set of his servants to another. I found it pointless personally ,and watching Milly\u2019s ( I guess) sweet but clueless ramble kinda silly and did nothing to raise my opinion of her or help me get to know her.I kinda sorta liked Milly but we never get to know her or Varrik or why they like each other other than the obvious ..Milly who seems oddly ok,being a kidnapped slave from earth,does more then to try to make the best out of a bad situation,she acts more like she was born a slave and this is just more or less what she\u2019s used to. Except she is more than happy to ignore the protocols and rules of stuck up aliens around her and just do whatever Varrik seems to be ok with and allow.Then suddenly three weeks have passed of their seeming platonic relationship where w/out us they\u2019ve supposedly gotten closer and to know each other and their suddenly going to be mated/married to protect Milly and because she doesn\u2019t want to have sex w/the \u201cpower balance \u201c being \"Master/Slave\u201d.Yeah, well Milly ole girl,your kinda naive a bit aren\u2019t you... He\u2019s no longer your Master per se but your still in a galaxy where everyone sees you as less then dirt and probably wouldn\u2019t spin on you if you were on fire \ud83d\udd25. Soo your still ,married or not, completely and totally dependent and beholding to him and his kindness and mercy.So yeah it\u2019s better but....Then sex and basically the end.I\u2019m not sure what to say here,I know tons will love it because,Well because Ms.Dixon wrote it.But while novellas are short that doesn\u2019t mean they have to be lacking . If done right it doesn\u2019t take but a few paragraphs to make you feel like you know someone. Same with two MC\u2019s getting to know each other...This was sparse and vapid. Like biting into a sandwich or a burrito expecting something filling and only finding lettuce and some condiments... you might eat it all but you feel your time wasted because there\u2019s nothing there...Ms. Dixon is a very talented writer but you don\u2019t see it here.If this a first book for you with her,try book one in her \u201cIce Planet Barbarian\u201d series and go from there. If your a long time fan? You don\u2019t need me to advise you... \u201cNothing here to see here folks\u201d is how I\u2019d sum this up...Thanks",

The highest ranking alien decided he wanted her and claimed her as his own.The alien who claimed Milly (sorry, can\u2019t go back and get the weird name) was bored with the lifestyles of the rich and nobles and the month long parties they attended. Milly was funny and sweet and he enjoyed her company and made her his companion even though it was bad for his reputation. He treats Milly like an equal and Milly loves him for it, and of course there is a true happily ever after at the end.",
