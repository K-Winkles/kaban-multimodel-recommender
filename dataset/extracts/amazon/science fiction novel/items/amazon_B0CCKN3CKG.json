                "reviewText": "I was a little bit disappointed that I got the old 90s cover of the book instead of the new one, but that's ultimately a quibble....Robotech has a bit of a complex history. Modern anime purists may despise it, but it was the best available to us back in the mid-80s. The novels by Jack McKinney help smooth over some of the continuity problems that arose from the editing of three unrelated tv series together into a more harmonious whole IMO.The war against the Zentraedi still wages, with many of our heroes falling, and many of our villains gaining depth and sympathy as they come to understand our (and their) humanty better and better. War is hell, and in the end, the only victory may be in mere survival. Even after war's end, those survivors remain will have to spend their lives trying to rebuild a blasted and broken world. And what the power of love saved, the power of hate might still destroy.",

I think that people will find out that the characters displayed in the book are more real than they think. For instance, most sci-fi books have the shoot'em up and get the girl type genre. But this book portrays the life story of Rick Hunter in the Zentraedi conflict. He works to help the citizens of Macross survive in combat and in deep space. Romance and comedy come into play and a whole bunch of other stories surface. The way that Jack McKinney plots the stories will keep you up for hours gripping this book for more. I give this book five stars for detail, action, romance, and story plot.",
