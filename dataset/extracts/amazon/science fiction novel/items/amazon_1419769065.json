Anderson\u2019s comic adaptation of Frank Herbert\u2019s \u201cDune\u201d with art from Ra\u00fal All\u00e9n and Patricia Mart\u00edn as well as Bill Sienkiewicz, who previously adapted David Lynch\u2019s 1984 film version of \u201cDune\u201d for Marvel Comics. The story picks up following the events of the first volume, with Paul Atreides and the Lady Jessica fleeing into the desert after the Harkonnens attacked. There they meet Stilgar and his sietch, learning more of the Fremen customs in order to discover the source of desert power. Meanwhile, Baron Harkonnen schemes on Giedi Prime, plotting the future of his heir, Feyd. All\u00e9n, Mart\u00edn, and Sienkiewicz beautifully bring to vivid life Herbert\u2019s story, using color to particular effect in their storytelling. The use of color resembles the Sci-Fi Channel\u2019s 2000 miniseries adaptation of \u201cDune.\u201d This volume ends with Lady Jessica\u2019s transformation into a Reverend Mother, setting the stage for volume three, \u201cProphet\u201d, due out in spring 2024.",

It catches and expands both the power and nuance of Paul Muad'dib's journey without sacrificing the galactic scope of his transformation on Arrakis. The art and story telling give a new perspective on Frank Herbert's original text without sacrificing Dune's intricacy of plot and sheer grit -- this graphic version combines the cinnamon texture of spice with the rising passion of the jihad. Having whetted the collective appetite for revenge against \"that floating fat man\" and his ilk, there already is space on bookshelves for the 2024 conclusion.",

For instance, see page 156 and 157, white text over orange background, really? (maybe I am getting old and grounchy)I will definetely buy the 3rd volumen... but please, if the authors are reading this, be merciful of your readers :-)",
