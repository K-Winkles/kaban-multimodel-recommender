That being said, for all of the ungodly powers and capabilities that The Author has given to Gustav \u2014 The Author also lets a hell of a lot drop by the side. As The Reader is working through the pages, there are options that clearly scream out loud that \u201cOF COURSE\u201d Gustav is handling them \u2014 only we find out he\u2019s not. Very strange!!!Then, a very unfortunate but less minor brain-fart occurs when The Author identifies someone being at the beach with \u201ca pleasant mix of sand and warm Atlantic current\u201d \u2014 when in the next sentence the beach is identified as \u201cSandy Point State Park\u201d \u2014 which is in Maryland along the Chesapeake Bay \u2014 many, many miles from the Atlantic Ocean \u2026This book and Author present an interesting set of circumstances, which makes the book enjoyable for a SciFi audience \u2014 but the paths not chosen by The Author will always haunt how good the book could have been.",

                "reviewText": "I do a lot of reading for work and over the years my work has sucked the joy out of reading for pleasure. I recently went on vacation and picked up this book for a 9.5 hour flight thinking I'd maybe read a couple chapters and then snooze or watch a movie.That wasn't the case. I read the entire thing in one sitting on that flight.The Menagerie is one of those books you can't put down. It's a story about a powerful AI and it's societal impacts told through the lens of a espionage and geopolitical intrigue. The author, Chris Kelly, teases out whether this new invention is something to be feared, like Frankenstein's monster, or the dawn of a new golden era for humanity.Chris Kelly writes in a similar style to Michael Crichton. Kelly teaches enough about AI and a couple thought experiments related to it to create the architecture for his story in a way that brings the audience up to speed without getting bogged down in technical minutiae. The book is fun and also leaves you with enough knowledge about AI and potential impacts to spur fun discussion after reading. I had a great time talking to my wife about it on the beach after we landed.I can't recommend this book enough and I look forward to reading more from Chris Kelly.",

One day he discovers he has created Gustav, an artificial intelligence that has come alive. The question is can it be the turning point for humanity without destroying humans? Suddenly Miles is being pursued by various organizations in the US and abroad who want to be able to control Gustav at no cost. Gustav helps hide Miles for protection but often Miles questions his actions and is lonely. As the world spirals downward, Miles grapples with the ethical implications while trying to avoid being a casualty. The author does a good job pointing out different viewpoints or perspectives of one reality dealing with nuclear warheads. It is an interesting book for the Sci Fi community of which I\u2019m not one. That is one reason for my 3-star rating and the other was the surprise ending.",
