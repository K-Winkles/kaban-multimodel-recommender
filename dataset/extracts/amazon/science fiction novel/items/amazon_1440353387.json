This book is important for writers of all genres to read and also for anyone interested in understanding science and technology in all types of media. The book is an impressive collection of experts in many different fields such as astronomy, biology, ecology, videogame production and animation, medicine, psychiatry to name a few represented in this book. The experts discuss how science and technology is often misunderstood by writers or by movies and facts are often ignored or distorted. The experts give solid examples of such cases. They also give credit when scientific facts are used in a credible manner whether in a book or a movie. I loved the informal style of the contributors and as a non-scientific person appreciated the use of clear understandable language without use of jargon. It helped that there was a wide array of fields represented and that the chapters were concise and to the point. I loved reading this book and have no hesitation in recommending it highly. Kudos to the editor for thinking of this much needed and timely topic.",

                "reviewText": "In general, I thought this was a very good book. It has multiple authors, each addressing some basic \"things you should know.\" The authors hit the high points, and (a big plus) give references for learning more about each subject. Naturally, the articles vary in quality. I particularly liked the section on gravity, which gave some really nice shortcuts for avoiding complex calculations. Conversely, the section on wolves was largely a complaint about how they are treated in fiction, rather than making positive suggestions about how they should be portrayed.It shouldn't need to be said, but--you don't have to be an author to enjoy this book.",

When I learned that he was putting some of the essays from his site into a book, I had to buy it. Now I have a great reference on my shelf which is a starting point for research.The book is divided into sections that cover biomedical topics, including death, genetics (Koboldt\u2019s specialization), neuroscience, wildlife biology, artificial intelligence and other computer-based technology, Earth and the planets of our solar system, astronomy and space flight, and, finally, the future of space travel and exoplanets.Chuck Wendig writes the foreword, on the advice to write what you know and what it really means (do your research). In his signature playful tone, Wendig clarifies the advice and demonstrates how he\u2019s applied it in his own writing life, finishing by calling Putting the Science in Fiction a great launching pad for essential research.The contributors themselves write with humour\u2014find out why, as a woman working in a lab, you should never wear thong underwear\u2014and draw on their personal expertise for an enjoyable read. In the chapters addressing space travel, they reveal their geek roots, honouring the books, television shows, and movies that inspired them while at the same time pointing out the technical misconceptions such media sometimes promote.Putting the Science in Fiction is a great reference for any writer\u2019s shelf.",
