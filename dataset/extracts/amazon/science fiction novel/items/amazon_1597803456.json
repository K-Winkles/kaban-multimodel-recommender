                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Variety and Some Real Hits",
                "reviewText": "Whenever you get an anthology of short stories you're going to get some hits, some you can take or leave, and a few that you can't understand why they were included to begin with. This collection, for me, had many hits, a few I could take or leave, and no duds.The advantage to a big collection like this is that you get a wide variety of styles and subject matter. The anthology has both fantasy and science fiction stories, and these explore a lot of sub-genres and different takes on these fields. The drawback is that most of the stories are quite short, and just about the time you're really getting into them, they're over. This is a very different reading experience than reading even a short novel. If you picture the experience of this book as a buffet or a dim sum, you have the right metaphor: lots of small bites, nothing that gives you a full stomach on its own. I read this book at the rate of one story a day and chewed it up in about a month, which felt just right. I read several other books while reading this one, which you can get away with, because each short story requires only a small commitment to finish, and there are no continuing characters or plot lines to keep straight from day to day.In terms of quality, this is a big book (nearly 600 pages) chock full of strong stories that cut across many sub-genres. Whatever it is you like, there's almost guaranteed to be some of it here. In terms of value, there are about 30 stories herein. I'm not sure what that is in word count, but it's a great value for its buck. You can use this collection to find new authors, zeroing in on short works you really like and checking out that author's longer works to see if you like those, too. In terms of how it stacks up against other \"Best of\" anthologies, I would say it's stronger than Rich Horton's sci-fi and fantasy collection (fewer duds, no repeats) and not as strong as Gardner Dozois' best of sci-fi, which tends to be scarily good. I definitely recommend it for casual reading or to fit in with other works and to scan for new writers and old favorites.",
