While the Crown Princess of Lancia seeks to share the new technology, her father, the Emperor, has other plans. His latest political maneuverings seem to be tilting the balance of control to Lancia\u2019s favor\u2014a move that not all members of the New Alliance are looking upon favorably.

The emotional througjlines between lines and humans are good and I like where this series is headed vis a vie non-human intelligence.[MINOR SPOILERS] However, both the romances are very poorly written. The super savvy princess is in love with her established father figure is a gross trope, and the dynamic is almost Anne Mcaffrey-like in its cringe factor. It also doesn't fit with any of the rest of the book. Politically, it would be a terrible idea to marry your fleet admiral. He's already established as her father figure (the ages are unclear, but it was mentioned previously that he basically raised her) but making him into her lover reeks of the \"men and women can't be friends without sex\" trope which is one of my most hated.The other pairing is politically ok, but not great ssecurity-wise. They also don't really earn it. Like, they definitely spend a lot of time in the same room together and they've each saved each other's life, but besides some weirdly jealous glaring when someone else is called his girlfriend, it was not foreshadowed at all. (Jealousy as an indicator of love is also one of my least favorite tropes). The fact that she has been contractually obligated to almost never leave his side for 3 books makes it feel kinda stockholm-y too.",

                "reviewText": "with lots of action to draw the reader along, and an interesting setup with the line ships. The characters are appealing, especially Ean (though he\u2019s a Very Nice guy and far too virtuous to be real), and he\u2019s definitely balanced by Jordan Rossi. Rossi is an odd character\u2014both a thoroughly nasty person and an excellent linesman who\u2019s always responsible about his work. I was surprised that neither Sale nor Radko had smacked Rossi down for calling them \u201cSweetheart.\u201d They are tough competent women and I would have expected them both to cut him off at the knees.At any rate, I enjoyed the series and will look for the authors\u2019 other books.SPOILER BEGINSI also didn\u2019t understand the lack of sanctions against Rossi after he attacked Ean. Ean could have been killed and yet the officers said barely anything about it and certainly didn\u2019t punish Rossi for it? That was just not believable to me. First off, if Rossi had killed or badly injured Ean, the New Alliance would have no one who could move the alien fleet or interpret between the fleet and the New Alliance government. Second, this inaction undermined Ean with the trainees even worse than Rossi\u2019s snide little comments already had (and I have no idea why those were tolerated either). It was like everyone just said, \u201cOh that\u2019s just Rossi being Rossi,\u201d and let it go. Did not make sense to me at all.SPOILER ENDS",

                "reviewText": "What an awesome conclusion to a fantastic trilogy, but I\u2019ve heard there may be more in the Linesman universe, so I\u2019m keeping my fingers crossed. Ean is still learning as he works with the alien lines and teaching more linesmen how to communicate with them. The New Alliance is threatened by their enemies, but then there is suspected treachery from within. Ean\u2019s friend and bodyguard Radko is sent on a mission to purchase a report with information on linesman experiments, which turns into a much bigger issue. Then there is the arrival of Emperor Yu, with his best friend in tow. All of Yu\u2019s political intrigue is interfering with the progress Princess Michelle has made for Lancia with their allies in the New Alliance. When someone tries to steal one of the smaller alien ships, things become even more dangerous, and some of the new linesmen trainees seem to be causing dissent as well. It will take all of Ean\u2019s shipmates on the Lancastrian Princess and especially Ean, to get through this uncertain time and find the threat from within. I loved this series - the outstanding world building, the wonderful characters, and all of the action kept me reading nonstop. I really hope there is more because I\u2019ll certainly be happy to jump on it as soon as I get word that it is available.",

What drew me forward was the evolving story of the ship lines and the development of character relationships--a slow build toward understanding and trust that is completely different from so many stories where people bond into a team for no perceptible reason.Political intrigue is a theme, as well as developing self-confidence and strength. The main character is a classic engineer/programmer/savant, completely immersed in his work, but is kind and caring when he interacts with others.There are no sex scenes, but there are a couple of very slow burn romances I enjoyed. The violence is not graphic, though it has an impact.Scenes and dialog are well-written. There are very, very few copyediting issues, (none that I noticed), and the writing is practically transparent. I love that. These books are all about story.As others have commented, the female characters in this story are strong, whether they are good guys or bad guys. I was a little surprised to find a future with emperors and planets on which women are merely partners to men, but the narrative voice disapproved of those, so it didn't reduce my enjoyment.",
