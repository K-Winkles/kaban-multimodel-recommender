Oversized, stylish artwork and a deeply emotional story had me hooked throughout. While it might have felt too short, understand it is a collected graphic novel of only 6 issues of a comic book. Written by one of the top ten comic writers working today, Jeff Lemire truly created something special with Sentient. This would make an incredible movie and I won't be the least bit surprised if Netflix snatches up the rights and produces it as a stand-alone movie, or even limited series. Buy this now. You won't be disappointed.",

My only complaint is that it can be a tad fuzzy in some places but overall this is a great addition to have in your library.Little disclaimer for you tho. This isnt really space horror. This is far from a dead space or aliens style story so just know if that's what your going into this thinking you may be disappointed.Overall tho would recommend. It's solid stuff.",

Vide Black Hammer, que \u00e9 fant\u00e1stico. Sentient \u00e9 uma obra que te prende desde o in\u00edcio. Lemire usa os clich\u00eas de filmes espaciais de uma maneira \u00fanica, conferindo-lhes um aspecto de coisa nova, e funciona. Essa miniss\u00e9rie encadernada \u00e9 \u00f3tima e muito bem desenhada pelo Gabriel Walta (Vis\u00e3o). Voc\u00ea l\u00ea e j\u00e1 fica imaginando como ficaria bom se fosse levada a uma s\u00e9rie no NETFLIX",
