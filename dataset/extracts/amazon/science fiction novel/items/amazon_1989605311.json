However, Eodain maintains his mission to pass the knowledge of the written word on to all in the world.I received The Knowledge Seeker for an honest review.",

                "reviewText": "I've been a fan of Knightly's middle grade Ben Archer series and was keen to try her YA novel, The Knowledge Seeker. What a ride from start to finish! I love the world building of this novel, far into the future, where the Enlightened People have left behind knowledge which is fiercely guarded at the Atheneum by the Knowledge Seekers with Uncle Denesius at the helm. When the safety of the Atheneum and all it contains is at risk, Termite, aka Eodain, sets out on a perilous journey to protect the last Talisman. He is accompanied by a motley crew. This story had a Brotherhood of the Ring vibe but in a more hostile and chilling environment with the Roarim's Wraith Lord and the Pirate Lord both nipping at Eodain's heels. The ending caught me utterly by surprise and, in my opinion, are the best kinds of stories! It all fell into place in the last few chapters and left me wanting to read more about the main character, Eodain and his love interest, Elysa. What I especially appreciated was that the story did not end on a happily-ever-after, but a hopeful note. I certainly hope there's book two in this fantastic world. Highly recommended!",
