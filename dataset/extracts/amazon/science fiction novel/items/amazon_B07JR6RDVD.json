What I got was a bunch of words strung together with little basis for them being there. Stories that went in nothing circles, or inane story lines, or worse just stupid. There were 2 short stories that tried to be good and I guess not bad, one about a teen caged in a \"coffin\" that was the fault of parents but the vitriol that the author poured into her bio/comments made the whole thing ridiculous. The other was marred by again the author's perceived problems with society and his own problems with how people treat him, plus liberal use of the N word. No one needs to use that word.Sadly if I could return it I would as it will not be read again....",
