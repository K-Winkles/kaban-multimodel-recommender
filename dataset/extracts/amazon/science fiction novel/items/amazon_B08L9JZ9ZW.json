A suicidal machine runs the world, while the passion between two humans provides the only hope for humankind.The Steps of the Sun When the world\u2019s richest man travels to the stars in search of the mineral wealth America needs to get it out of an energy crisis, he finds more than he bargains for\u2014and gets more than he ever believed was possible . . .\u201cAmong the finest science fiction novels . . . . Just beneath the surface it might be read as a parable of the Fifties and of the Cold War. Beneath that as an evocation of existential loneliness, a Christian fable, a parable of the artist. Above all, perhaps, as the wisest, truest representation of alcoholism ever written.\u201d \u2014James Sallis, Fantasy & Science Fiction on The Man Who Fell to Earth \u201cA moral tale that has elements of Aldous Huxley\u2019s Brave New World, Superman, and Star Wars\u201d \u2014Los Angeles Times Book Review on Mockingbird \u201cEngaging and effortlessly readable.\u201d \u2014Publishers Weekly on The Steps of the Sun",
