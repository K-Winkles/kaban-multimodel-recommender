                "reviewText": "The late great planet E.C. Collected here on archival paper and a stupendous binding is the very last of the E.C. science fiction comics. The last three issues bear the Comics Code Seal. Because of a misguided witch hunt (are there any other kinds?), the comics industry created a self-policing arm to \"clean up\" comics which were somehow being blamed for juvenile delinquency! It soon became clear that the main goal of the Comics Code was to punish E.C. for daring to have the best writers and illustrators working in the industry. Bill Gaines, president of E.C. tried working with the code but found their interference and petty objections far too much of a pain to bother with. \"Mad\" had recently graduated from comic book to magazine and was, therefore, free of the strictures of the code. Bill Gaines killed all of his comics and placed all of his eggs in the Mad basket. The rest is, as they say, history.This collection aptly demonstrates why E.C was the top of the heap. Everything, save the back covers is as it was. We get the letters columns and the short stories. What masterpieces these stories are. I was particularly fond of the \"Adam Link\" tales and loved the work of artists like Wallace Wood and Jack Davis, whom I had grown up with while reading Mad. Seeing them in full color is a wonderful experience not to be missed.Once the code comes in for the final three issues, you get a sense of what Bill Gaines was up against. There is not a huge drop off in quality in the final issues but the artists are beginning to be hemmed in. The cave women wear a lot more clothes in the final issues.The comic did go out with a bang, however, the final tale \"An Eye For An Eye\" by Angelo Torres is brilliantly sardonic. An excellent coda to one of the finest comic books ever produced.If you grew up reading Mad, you will want to buy this collection. If you have ever wondered if the hype about E.C. comics was accurate, you need to buy this collection. If you are a fan of great craftsmanship and masterful writing, you need to purchase this collection. In short, it is excellent!",

                "reviewText": "The latest EC archive is the longest one yet, collecting 7 issues. Finally, after some 5 issue archives, Dark Horse gives us an archive with more than the standard 6 issues. This archive also straddles the New Trend/New Direction line. The first three issues collected, Weird Science-Fantasy #27-29, fall in the former group. The last four, Incredible Science Fiction #30-33, with the comics code stamp prominently on the cover, are in the short lived New Direction group.The effects of the comics code are subtle but present. Even though EC's science fiction books lacked much of the shock effects of the horror books or the subtext of sexuality of the crime books that the code was supposed to stamp out, they did have a lot of subtle digs at modern society and its values. Thus the \"Adam Link\" adaptations in Weird Science-Fantasy, with their commentary on the human condition, do not continue into Incredible Science Fiction.The biggest change is the previously unknown Jack Oleck becomes the writer. He does try to pack some punch into his stories within the constrains of the code but his success is limited. The stories by Al Feldstein and Otto Binder in Weird Science-Fantasy are generally better.The art is stellar. Wally Wood looks outstanding and that is no easy feat with features by Al Williamson, Joe Orlando, Reed Crandall, Jack Kamen, and others.One frustration that is not really the fault of EC is that two issues of Weird Science-Fantasy, #25 and #26, have not yet been collected. They will appear in Weird Fantasy Archives Volume 4 in due course. One of them is the famous \"Flying Saucer Special Report\" which is referenced in the letters pages of the issues collected here and made a huge impression on the EC readership of the time. I hope we see this collection next year at some point.Highly recommended. The comics code takes some of the heart out of the stories in the later issues but they are still very entertaining.",

This has work from Wood and Williams at the peak of their EC output, as well as the only Frazetta cover. It can only be described as stunning, and so far ahead of what Marvel /DC were doing at the time as to be laughable. The hardcover is in the realm on unobtainium at present, so grab this, the paper quality and reproduction is still excellent. The stories all have the typical EC plot twist, and certainly reflective of their 50s period, but no less enjoyable for it.",

                "reviewText": "Los libros que recopila (por fortuna para nosotros, que podemos leerlos y disfrutarlos casi setenta a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de publicados) The EC Archives, pueden dividirse en dos clases:Aquellos t\u00edtulos que han sido reunidos en varios tomos (desde tres y hasta cinco); y aquellos como \u00e9ste, donde se agruparon en un s\u00f3lo libro los n\u00fameros de la revista en cuesti\u00f3n.En este caso, Incredible Science Fiction, que cambi\u00f3 su nombre original de Weird Science-Fantasy por uno m\u00e1s breve y, quiz\u00e1, m\u00e1s vendedor, tuvo una vida de siete ejemplares.El arte, los dibujos, los colores, son indudablemente asombrosos, aplaudibles, como fue por suerte el sello de la casa de EC.Sobre eso, sobre el \"c\u00f3mo\", no hay ni la menor queja. Al contrario: aplausos, quitada de sombrero y ovaciones, porque (\u00bfhay que decirlo de nuevo?) los dibujantes (artistas ser\u00eda m\u00e1s justo llamarlos), eran en verdad portentosos. Sin computadora. Sin programas de dise\u00f1o Sin nada m\u00e1s que l\u00e1pices, pinceles, frascos de pintura...El \"c\u00f3mo \" no es el problema. Lo es el \"qu\u00e9\", es decir, las historias, los argumentos.El \"c\u00f3mo\" ya qued\u00f3 expresado que es una maravilla, pero lo que nos relatan los dibujos est\u00e1 por debajo del arte mostrado.Ejemplifiquemos: Hay por lo menos cuatro historias que presentan humanos tipo cavernarios (vestidos muy al estilo Tarz\u00e1n, ellos y ellas): \"An eye for an eye\", \"Big moment\", \"Fallen idol\", \"Vicious circle\"...Esto hace que el lector sienta un \"dej\u00e1 v\u00fa\" cuando est\u00e1 leyendo la segunda o tercera de estas historias.Luego, viene la secuencia de historias sobre \"I, Robot\" que... Digamos que est\u00e1 bien, como novela en entregas, pero se agota tan pronto la premisa del robot bueno, de gran coraz\u00f3n (\u00bfel hombre de hojalata de El mago de Oz?) que acaba por aburrir.Y as\u00ed, tambi\u00e9n se multiplican los relatos donde el mundo ha sido destruido, gracias a las armas del hombre necio y siempre b\u00e9lico. A veces como defensa contra invasiones extraterrestres, a veces no.Abundan las narraciones donde, ante alien\u00edgenas, el ser humano debe preguntarse qui\u00e9n es el monstruo entre ambas especies...Y todo es tan parecido, una nueva historia tan similar a la que se acaba de leer...Y bueno, como nota curiosa y finalmente humor\u00edstica, hay un relato cuyo t\u00edtulo es \"Lost in space\". Considerando que se incluye en el volumen n\u00famero 28, de marzo-abril 1955, debe uno decir \"\u00a1Wow, qu\u00e9 futuristas, se adelantaron a su tiempo!\" ( y, para quien no entendi\u00f3 el comentario, hubo una serie televisiva muy exitosa de los a\u00f1os sesenta, llamada exactamente as\u00ed).",
