                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Six novellas that will each transport you to entirely new worlds",
                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve known of Robert Silverberg\u2019s work through reputation, but never actually checked him out, despite his status as one of the greats of classic science-fiction. Luckily, Sailing to Byzantium, a collection of six of his novellas, more than holds up that status, giving me a sense of the giant imagination Silverberg could bring to bear, but also seeing how he could take these ideas and turn them into something richer and more complex, using his conceits and ideas as a jumping off point for a meditation on humanity, our relationship with death, our grapplings with organized religion, the importance of community, and so much more.But for all of their musings about larger matters, what will first strike you about Silverberg\u2019s stories are their exceptional, stunning scope of imagination. Take the title story, which sees a 20th century man adrift in the 50th century, as citizens drift from one artificially reconstructed historic city to another, giving us tourism that spans space and time, all while also demonstrating what it would be like to see your society reconstructed with guesses and best evidence. Similar stories about death and our place in the world are echoed in \u201cBorn with the Dead,\u201d a tale in which human beings an be \u201crekindled\u201d into a living body, but come back as someone wholly new and different.Other times, Silverberg finds himself thinking about the role of religion, such as \u201cThomas the Proclaimer,\u201d in which God grants proof of his existence by freezing the rotation of the earth, or \u201cWe Are for the Dark,\u201d as humanity tries to find the divine with the presence of science and FTL travel. Or there\u2019s the idea of shared consciousness, which we see in \u201cHomecoming,\u201d in which a scientific experiment to see into the future results in a man\u2019s consciousness combining with a far, far-distant lobster race, seeing the world through the eyes of something wholly inhuman and yet clearly conscious and thinking. But the idea is followed up on in \u201cThe Secret Sharer,\u201d which pays tribute to Conrad\u2019s tale by featuring a stowaway who\u2019s little more than a digital burst of thoughts.All of these are great hooks for stories, but what makes them work is Silverberg\u2019s grasp of humanity and his strong prose, which can capture both the scope of his imagination and the complexity of his emotional palette. He can nail the beauty of \u201cByzantium\u2019s\u201d recreated cities, but also find the pain of seeing someone you love \u201crekindled\u201d only to come back as someone wholly other. He can describe the alien perceptions of a lobster race, but he can also convey the wonder experienced as we dive into the darkness that allows us to explore the universe. At times, those emotions and descriptions become the point of the tales more than the plotting \u2013 indeed, Silverberg is of that school of writers for whom plot is a secondary concern, one used to anchor his ideas and his imagination \u2013 but when the stories are this rich and compelling, that\u2019s only rarely an issue, and even then, only a small one. No, you may feel occasionally frustrated by odd endings here and there, but mainly, you\u2019ll come away having been transported to six wholly new worlds, and that\u2019s what we read fiction for.",

Again, I wonder what I have been missing all these years. Eager to read more of Silverberg's works, I bought Sailing to Byzantium, which includes six of his novellas. All of them were great.The style of writing is as engaging and competent as Asimov's, but Silverberg's sci-fi isn't as hard as Asimov's and his plots are so out of this world I wonder if he takes drugs!I'll be reading more of Robert Silverberg's books.",

                "reviewText": "Each of these six novellas are quite good as one might expect since they were written by Silverberg during his peak years.My favorite was the title piece, \"Sailing to Byzantium\", about a 20th century man who finds himself in the fiftieth century. In this future there are five recreated cities of the past (though they are changed every so often). This 20th century man is confused about the point of it all.Another interesting tale, \"Thomas the Proclaimer\", imagines what would happen if God revealed his existence by having the Earth stop rotating. And another religious tale, \"We are for the Dark\", has mankind spreading out into the Galaxy having discovered a means to transport humans through space by placing a receiver on another planet.",

He captivated me.He is a VERY good writer.Highly recommended",

                "reviewText": "The idea of robots having feelings and/or thinking they're human is not a new one, and certainly not with this author. But emotions come directly from chemicals acting on the brain and without them, and an organic brain, emotions are simply not possible. And that includes love. Obviously there are different forms of love but no robot could feel any of them. Aside from that this story is very depressing: depicting an empty, sterile future where empty, identical people live utterly pointless lives of aimless pleasure seeking. That this thrill and pleasure seeking involves recreating ancient cities -temporarily- and flitting between them seems weird but i suppose not impossible. And the visitors seem utterly pointless: they're just machines, what could they possibly bring to the party? Why would anyone want to spend decades living with one? Personally, I think a future like that would involve ultra realistic VR and drugs, with everyone living in a virtual fantasy world of their own devising, and no human ever seeing another real person. But hey, what do I know. I do know I felt this story was just...nothing.",
