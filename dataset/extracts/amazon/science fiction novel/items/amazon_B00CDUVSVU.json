I do like where this last book was going, but it is like it was rushed and cut short to get to the publisher as there are a lot of unanswered questions. Still a very awesome book and series.",

                "reviewText": "This review is strictly for the audio books as most people will read the books first and then buy the audio book as a supplement. I first bought the Freedom series on cassette tapes (yes, I AM that old) and just fell in love with the acting of the two performers; Susie Breck and Dick Hill. They are just absolutely stunning with their vocal talents and help bring Anne McCaffrey's stories to brilliant life. I love audio books. They help pass the time when travelling long-distance in my car, make the walk with the dog not so boring, and help me survive traffic without resorting to road-rage.As anyone who has ever read an Ann McCaffrey story knows, she is just brilliant in bringing her fantasy worlds to life; so much so, that you have to keep reminding yourself that there are no such things as Catteni, Earth has never been attacked by aliens, and (for the Pern series) that there are NO dragons. She has a true gift with her different worlds she creates and it makes each book pure escapism.Susie Breck and Dick Hill have truly ruined me on just one actor taking on numerous characters. They each have such distinct voices for each character, that you don't need the \"Zainal said,\" and \"Kris said,\" to clarify. They help bring the words they perform to vivid life and you just get lost in the story and forget you're being \"read\" too.If you have any doubts about any book performed by these two actors, don't hesitate. They help the super talent author bring her stories to life.",

Almost like Anne was looking for a thread to the next great adventure.",

Anne McCaffrey is sorely missed.",

                "reviewText": "This saga is set in the future and earth is dominated by a race of Catteni who are under the direction of the Eosi, a high race however not a better race. Kris is a wonderful heroine who gets redeposited on an alien planet with a few hundred of other humans and aliens and Zainal, who beomes the unlikely hero of these series. You find yourself in love with Zainal, once he realizes how wonderful the human race really is. Its a wonderful read as it has something for everyone. I'm myself have re-read this four book series four times already.",
