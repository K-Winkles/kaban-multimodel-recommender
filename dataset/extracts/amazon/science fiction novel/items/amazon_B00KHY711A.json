        "description": "Not just another science audiobook and not just another Discworld novella, The Science of Discworld is a creative, mind-bending mash-up of fiction and fact, that offers a wizard\u2019s-eye view of our world that will forever change how you look at the universe. Can Unseen University\u2019s eccentric wizards and orangutan Librarian possibly shed any useful light on hard, rational Earthly science? In the course of an exciting experiment, the wizards of Discworld have accidentally created a new universe. Within this universe is a planet that they name Roundworld. Roundworld is, of course, Earth, and the universe is our own. As the wizards watch their creation grow, Terry Pratchett and acclaimed science writers Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen use Discworld to examine science from the outside. Interwoven with the Pratchett\u2019s original story are entertaining, enlightening chapters which explain key scientific principles such as the Big Bang theory and the evolution of life on Earth, as well as great moments in the history of science.

I came across this series recently and I have been listening to the audiobooks but decided to order the hardcopy book so I could reread some of the science, take some notes, and really take it all in. There is a lot to take in! I opened the book and immediately knew I was in trouble. I have 70-ish year old eyes and this text will need my strongest magnifiers to read it. It is like the ingredients list on the back of a can of something.",

Ian Stewart, and Jack Cohen are marvelous writers who could make any rock fascinating. The problems are all my own. The science goes in one ear and out the other. I wish for more delightful Discworld character development and action, because I want to escape into Discworld. In this book the escapes are limited, and the science is long. However, if you have more brain power than I do, you will LOVE this book. The science is amazing, and very different from what I learned in high school! Here's a sample, \"... the point is that most of the atoms from which you are made must have come into being inside a star. As Jonie Mitchell sang at Woodstck, `We are Stardust.'Scientist like quoting this line, because it sounds as though they were young once.\"",

And Sir Terry's bits are indeed brilliant, as always. But the scientists just drone on and on, in far more detail than needed. And I can't always tell how what they're describing relates to the story. It's not that I'm not a big science fan, I am, and I read a lot of science books. Maybe I was expecting something a bit different. I think I was expecting, oh, I don't know, maybe how Roundworld laws of physics compare to their Discworld equivalents, if that makes any sense.",

                "reviewText": "This was great. Combo of discworld and real world science. Both my favorite topics. Unlike what the title may suggest, this book is not about the science of discworld at all. Rather, it just uses a discworld story as a take off point to talk about concepts such as origins of the universe , history of science and evolution. And it is written in a very entertaining way. The only major knock against the book is that it has a very western focus (where people tend to focus on scientific achievements in the west only. As if we went straight from Plato to Newton with no progress in between). The second issue is the fact that it is a bit dated and new discoveries have happened since but there is no science or history book immune from that but read it soon! All in all, 4.9 stars rounded up to 5",

                "reviewText": "Although Terry Pratchett (may he rest in peace) wrote his Discworld series as \"Fantasy,\" it was always firmly grounded in real science and history--from which it promptly took off into the stratosphere of the author's spectacular imagination. This is less a novel (though alternate chapters tell a story) than a science text. In fact, I would love to have this book (updated from 1999), and its companions (Science of Discworld II, III and IV) used as junior high science texts all over the country! The chapters (written by Pratchett) that tell a story give perfect context for the chapters that provide an entertaining dose of \"hard science\" (attributed to Pratchett, Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen), leading to questions to be asked in the next story-chapter. The explanations are understandable, yet thorough--the story is funny, surprising, and all around delightful!Please read this book--better yet, please read this book to the nearest 7th-grader.",

If you have read Dawkins, Bradshaw, Cavalli-Sforza, Spencer-Wells etc. etc. then you must read these Pratchett books! Even if you have not you should read them! The mix of Pratchett humor and the craziness of Discworld helps to lighten, or enlighten, the real science which more than half fills the books. Even if you cannot get your head round it all, they are still a wonderful read and leave you understanding just how much there is still to wonder at and how little we actually do understand.",

I'm happy that I read Lawrence Watt-Evans, 'The Turtle Moves', Discworld summary. I found out about the Science of Discworld there and had to have them. Also , my order for reading series was very similar to Mr. Watt-Evans's.Ordering a used book for the first time was interesting, listed as acceptable I didn't know what I would get.

We all have our favorite branches of Discworld society. The hard science appears to be both solid and witty, and a sly way to sneak some \"real\" knowledge into the portion of my family that appears to have gotten only the creative half of a brain. Once I am ready for a visit to reality I will read all the chapters. Also when I can get it back from the rest of the hoard.",

Es una delicia para los amantes de mundodisco que no podemos esperar a que alg\u00fan d\u00eda, alguna editorial caritativa se digne a traducir tales obras maestras.Es un texto denso y complejo, no lo recomiendo para gente que no sea muy fan de mundodisco y no est\u00e9 interesada en la ciencia.Por lo dem\u00e1s, es una delicia de libro.",

It makes learning about the universe fun in a way I have never before encountered.The Discworld story helps break up the science lessons into more comfortable pieces as well as helping support the science facts by presenting a different perspective. If you are expecting a simple story book you may be a bit disappointed, but if you like learning then this book is awesome!",
