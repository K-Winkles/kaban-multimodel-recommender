        "description": "In the vein of Jurassic Park, this high-concept thriller follows a group of graduate students lured to Hawaii to work for a mysterious biotech company\u2014only to find themselves cast out into the rain forest, with nothing but their scientific expertise and wits to protect them.In the lush forests of Oahu, groundbreaking technology has ushered in a revolutionary era of biological prospecting, feeding a search for priceless drugs and applications on a scale beyond anything previously imagined. In Cambridge, Massachusetts, seven graduate students at the forefront of their fields are recruited by a pioneering microbiology start-up, Nanigen MicroTechnologies, which dispatches the group to a mysterious lab in Hawaii. But once in the rainforest, the scientists are thrust into a hostile wilderness that reveals surprising dangers at every turn. Armed only with their knowledge of the natural world, they find themselves prey to a technology of radical and unbridled powerAn instant classic, Micro pits nature against technology in vintage Michael Crichton fashion. Completed by visionary science writer Richard Preston, this boundary-pushing thriller melds scientific fact with pulse-pounding fiction to create yet another masterpiece of sophisticated, cutting-edge entertainment.",

                "reviewText": "I went into 'Micro' knowing full well that Michael Crichton left a draft manuscript on his computer, and that it was Richard Preston who filled in the story. If you go in knowing that, you can set your expectations properly.\u2014 STORY \u2014The story of Micro is high-concept: a Rated-R version of 'Honey, I Shrunk The Kids.' What would happen if you took that old movie, kept the adventure, but had very serious consequences? That's Micro. After a mysterious introduction to hook you in, Micro follows the story of seven scientists with various specialties relating to the fields of biology. They are recruited as potential job candidates by a big corporation when something happens, and they are stuck as shrunken people. Using their brains, they have to work together with their specialized knowledge to escape the harrowing real world of Mother Nature.The concept of shrunken people is a big stretch but go with it. This book explores that concept as realistically as possible, with Michael Crichton bringing some real world science to help sell it.\u2014 DRAFT \u2014Knowing that this was still in draft mode, I'm sure Crichton still had a lot of research to do to explain and convince us of certain plot elements. Because of this, the story is not as fully detailed as a typical Crichton book. I think Richard Preston did his best to translate and get across what I can only assume were ideas that were still in development.The writing and dialogue seemed... simplistic. I think I'm not the only one with this opinion. It reads very high school. I'm not sure if this was because it was rushed, or because they wanted the writing at a level that would reach a larger audience. In any case, I'm just glad that we got one more Michael Crichton book.\u2014 SUMMARY \u2014If you want a fun adventure story, Micro is for you. The book reads almost like a screenplay, and I could already imagine the soon-to-be-released DreamWorks film. Recommended.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Good Enough...Not Great",
                "reviewText": "Knowing this novel wasn\u2019t entirely authored by Crichton, may he Rest In Peace, made me skeptical going in, though I have enjoyed the bit of Preston I\u2019ve read over the years. MC certainly had a knack for weaving complicated scientific subjects with fiction - just enough explanation without being boring or overwhelming to those unfamiliar. Here, the overall pace of the novel just felt off.Upfront, most of this review dwells on the negatives, however, I did read through until the end. It was -just- interesting enough to keep the page-turning happening.Spoilers to follow:-The Shrinking. For some reason, this took me by surprise, which in itself is a rarity - not enough coffee when I read the beginning is my guess. I almost put the book down, visions of the horrible \u2018Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\u2019 film crowding my head. I decided to continue for another 50 pages, and ended up reading through to the end, so...-There\u2019s a few characters that provide so little to the book, it\u2019s a wonder they didn\u2019t get cut in editing, or at the very least combined with others to make for a smoother read, such as with the shrunken group. I never found that MC wrote hugely fleshed out characters, but here, calling most of them one-dimensional might be too kind. I found no attachment to anyone in the group whatsoever; not that I wanted them to be hurt or die, but when they succeeded at something, or lost someone, the feeling evoked was, \u2018ok, next page\u2019, as opposed to actively rooting for them, being relieved, upset, angry, happy, -emotional-!-A couple characters exist simply as expositional vehicles, rather than having such information be delivered via narration; after the third or fourth time this happened, all I could do was shake my head. It felt unnatural...people don\u2019t often speak this way. One or two others were used only for their research specialty, period, which was convenient for convenience\u2019s sake.Furthermore, their acceptance of what had happened, their adjustment to it, as well as many of the dangerous issues they encountered, the deaths of their fellow lab acquaintances, they all pretty much rolled with, even the whiny/pessimistic characters.-The setting itself, within the forest, was the best character for me, and despite how some of the information was related (unnatural character-speak), I really enjoyed the science and technological aspects! Though the book was over 500 pages (per my Kindle), it felt as though it needed to be longer, as so much page-time was action-oriented. I wanted to know more about the processes involved with the shrinking, the environment they were in, the robot and other tech created. It\u2019s this that kept me turning the page, not the characters. The one exception was Rourke...he could\u2019ve been a novella on his own. Instead, he was introduced very, very late, and (it seems) died soon after.-There were a number of times I wondered about the logical thought processes of the characters. For example, at the beginning, I felt Peter was really, really jumping the gun with the evidence he had...but the shrinking had to get started somehow, I suppose. Good thing for the plot that Drake quickly turned into a \u201cmwah-ha-ha\u201d villain! And then Danny, at the end...I don\u2019t understand why they just let him stay like that in Rourke\u2019s home, what with his arm, not even in the magnet room...but here again, the story had to start its conclusion somehow, no?In the end, Micro did provide some interesting action, and a couple of surprises within its pages. For sure, it brings a load of nightmare fuel, depending on your personal fears. The science, the tech, and the setting were all fantastic, and I wanted more. The characters were nearly translucent, the plot roller-coastered from believable to plausible to ridiculous several times, and the overall writing simply wasn\u2019t as smooth as you\u2019d expect from either Crichton or Preston. Worth a read if you buy it on sale or borrow it from a friend or library.",

The story made me think on an old MAD magazine spoof of the movie Fantastic Voyage. The lab where the project was based was callled L.S.M.F.T, which stood for Labratory Section for making Folks Tiny.

                "reviewText": "Definitivamente n\u00e3o \u00e9 um Crichton. Depois de ter revisitado os livros do Jurassic Park, quis continuar na esteira do Crichton e esse n\u00e3o tinha lido. Realmente, o Richard Preston partiu de uma ideia inacabada e montou uma estrutura em volta dela. Embora muito mais implaus\u00edvel do que os outros romances do Crichton, o que faz mais diferen\u00e7a \u00e9 a grosseria das cenas, muitas vezes extrapolando na viol\u00eancia e acaba distraindo da trama e jogando na cara que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o est\u00e1 lendo o Crichton.Serve como um passatempo, mas n\u00e3o tem nem um d\u00e9cimo do charme do nosso querido autor.Na verdade, se a propaganda desse livro fosse honesta, deveria ser um livro do Richard Preston, baseada num esbo\u00e7o de Michael Crichton, e n\u00e3o colocar o nome desse \u00faltimo como autor.",
