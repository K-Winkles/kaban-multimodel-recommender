            "Editorial Reviews Review Praise for the Science Comics series:\"This series\u2015written by a handful of authors\u2015seems determined to offer a useful introduction to anything a curious grade-school student might wonder about. The insight behind these books is a powerful one. So much information about the world around us is actually better conveyed visually, through charts, illustrations, and sequential panels, than purely using words.\" \u2015New York Times\"Like having a Time Life Science Library in comic books. Which is awesome!\" \u2015Popular SciencePraise for Science Comics: Coral Reefs:\"Author and illustrator Wicks\u2019s experience shines through with accurate facts and appealing, colorful drawings.\" \u2015School Library Journal About the Author Maris Wicks lives in sunny Somerville, Massachusetts.

She became a fan after she read her Human Body Theater and she loved Coral Reefs too.After reading Coral Reefs, she asked me \"What animal does not have a head?\" and told me it is \"Coral\". She told me that they eat with their center point. And she talked about Sea Pans or Sea Whips, sea pens, sea anemones, and sea jellies. I have to refer to the book when writing this review to be honest but she can just introduce them to me as if they were her friends. Kids have very good memories but they never want to use them on things they feel boring. But Maris Wicks is such a good writer and illustrator who has made science a really interesting topic. And because of her, we got almost all Science Comics series, but her books are still the best.",

According to his teacher, my son is reading at about a 4th grade level, and he can plow through these books pretty quickly. He likes that its a graphic novel, I like that the science is presented in such an engaging way. With support I think kindergartners would enjoy reading these books snuggled with their favorite adults and they may hold interested for kids in 5th or 6th grade...especially if the Science Comics could be used instead of a boring text book. This series is great for home schoolers, avid readers, reluctant readers (graphic novels are less intimidating), and science lovers.",
