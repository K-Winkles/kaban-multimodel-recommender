It's engrossing from start to finish. Sometimes adult TMNT takes work. Bodycount was great for people who love violent comics like 80s Lobo, like me, but the story was pretty bad. The Image book was interesting, but overall not a success. This is it. I would love a prequel series of their adventures in this adult universe. Anyways, buy it. It's absolutely worth every penny.",

I don\u2019t want to spoil anything, but it is not the type of story you would expect from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The comics themselves are on their 5th or 6th printing due to the popularity of this story and a video game adaptation is in the works. So if you get your hands on the comics, like I did, I\u2019d still pick up the hardcover so you can actually read through it and keep your comics in mint condition.",
