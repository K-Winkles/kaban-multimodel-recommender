                "reviewText": "Is science fiction in decline? It is seemingly popular, but from a cinematic standpoint, most of it is only borderline SF, using the lasers, spaceships and aliens common to the genre while ignoring the truly speculative nature that makes science fiction unique. In the literary world, science fiction is getting more and more crowded out by its lightweight cousin, fantasy (which has its own problems). Like the ancient Roman Empire, the seeming strength of the genre hides the cracks that threaten to diminish it.But even if there was never another good science fiction novel published, it's comforting to know there's plenty of good, older material to choose from. 100 Must-Read Science Fiction Novels doesn't necessarily choose the best - either in terms of books or authors - but does provide a list of what the authors figure are the essential works in the field.This is, of course, a subjective list, but some of the ones you'd figure on being on such a list can be found: Frankenstein, The Foundation Trilogy, Neuromancer, The Time Machine, War of the Worlds and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. Sometimes, it is not the true classics that are picked, however: under Robert Heinlein, we get Orphans in the Sky and Starship Troopers, but Stranger in a Strange Land and the Moon is a Harsh Mistress may have been better choices (in my opinion).Many big authors, both past and present, are not featured, including John Varley, Keith Laumer, Clifford Simak, Marion Zimmer Bradley, Robert Sawyer, and Alastair Reynolds. Other, more obscure authors have been chosen instead, such as Angela Carter or Ward Moore. UK authors are probably overrepresented (then again, the authors are British).As said before, this is subjective, and you'll agree with some choices and disagree with others. What's more important, however, is that the writing is decent and informative and it gives you a chance to explore the wonderful universe of science fiction.",

The authors were including the most influential books, not the best.

                "reviewText": "100 Must Read Science Fiction Novels - Stephen Andrews & Nick Rennison (SF reference - review 0804 - March 30, 2019) This very compact book (it measures 5 1/2 by 4\" !) contains a great deal of useful data about Science-Fiction. The heart of the book are the 100 meaty reviews of the authors estimations of \"100 Must Read Science Fiction Novels\". The fact that I disagree with many of the authors selections - and I would imagine many other readers would also - making this a most recommended book. SF fans are an opinionated species and prone to arguing at the drop of a title or an authors name I've heard on the street. In addition to the reviews a detailed alphabetical index of all authors and titles mentioned and several appendices add to the books usefulness. One glaring omission is a listing in the front index of only those books \"must read\" reviewed books. Therefore I've made my own and include it here for the gentle readers use:100 Must Read SF Novels Index omitted from front index\u00b7p01 Aldiss - Hothouse\u00b7p02 Asimov - I Robot\u00b7p03 Asimov - Foundation\u00b7p05 Ballard - Droned World\u00b7p06 Ballard - Super Cannes\u00b7p08 Banks - Players of the Game\u00b7p10 Baxter - Moonseed\u00b7p11 Bayley - The Garments of Caen\u00b7p13 Bear - Blood Music\u00b7p14 Benford - Timescape\u00b7p16 Bester - Demolished Man\u00b7p17 Bester - Stars My Destination\u00b7p19 Bishop - Ancient of Days\u00b7p20 Blish - Case of Conscience\u00b7p23 Bradbury - Martian Chronicles\u00b7p24 Bradbury - Fahrenheit 451\u00b7p25 Brunner - The Sheep Look Up\u00b7p27 Budrys - Rogue Moon\u00b7p28 Burgess - Clockwork Orange\u00b7p29 E.R.

It reviews the most popular novels to come our way and gives it's opinion on each choice without giving away too much of the plot or story-line. They start with the earliest and most classic novels, also giving what other readers have felt about them over the years. Instead of including every great novel from any particular sci-fi novelsit, the book decides to include only one or two of his/her best works. They review each book with flair and honesty, and explain why the peice is considered a quality one. It wisely explains what made the particular novel so popular to the sci-fi community. Also, at the end of each review it gives alternates written by that same author and gives examples of other pieces that are simliar in idea, style and genre. All in all, it is an easy read that gets to the point in helping the beginner or the pro sci-fi reader become aware and identify which books would fit best on their library shelves.",

The distinction that was made between \"technology\" and \"speculative\" I thought was highly useful. It covers quite a long period too. Very authoratitive and insightful exploration of everything from \"pulp\", to \"speculative\" that includes more \"high brow\" variants. Great book.",

                "reviewText": "Physically the book is underwhelming being quite small. After a short intro from Christopher Priest there is longer intro by the authors who tell us their intentions. The main body of the book is like \"David Pringle's Best 100 Science Fiction Novels\" in that it purports to choose 100 novels. They are \"must-read\" rather than \"best\" in this case. There is an article about each of the 100 novels.I own a previous version called Bloomsbury Good Reading Guide to Science Fiction and Fantasy by M. H. Zool. It was published in 1989. The format is similar except it was by author instead of a by book. The two books are quite different in content to it is worth owning both. When done by different authors it gives another slant and many of the selections in the must-read 100 are not found in the other books I've referred to. It is also up to date, for example the 'read on' suggestions by Zool for A. C. Clarke include Greg Bear, Charles Sheffield, Robert Forward and Kim Stanley Robinson whereas the new version recommends Stephen Baxter, Jack McDevitt, Frederik Pohl, Olaf Stapledon and David Zindell.Each must read gets an article which is about 300 words (roughly a page). The format is two paragraphs, the firstly to describe the plot (without too many spoilers, the authors say) , the second which typically gives value judgements on the author's style, the quality of prose, their importance in the field, etc.I think it is a another worthwhile reference work and quite up to date. So while there are some of the usual classics by H. G. Wells, Asimov, Heinlein, etc, there are also modern books like \"Altered Carbon\" by Richard Morgan.I always worry about reading plot summaries because I prefer to know as little as possible of the plot just in case it spoils the story. The important thing is to know it is a recommended read and what are the characteristics of the author. So I have been tending to read the complete article for books I have already read but only the second half for books I haven't yet read.",

                "reviewText": "This book is like having a super enthusiastic sci-fi loving friend sit down and recommend FANTASTIC novels to you. It gives a flavour of the book and themes without giving away the plot. It has helped me delve deeper into this amazing genre. I would give the author 5 stars for the content.BUTThe gripe I have is to do with the KINDLE formatting. Surely an A-Z guide should allow the reader to skip from book to book in alphabetical order. This does not. Seriously - the publishers should load up the ebook and try to browse the 100 books. There is no easy way of seeing the names of the recommendations. Frustrating isn't it? Guidebooks are all about accessibility and ease of use. It should have a proper contents page at the very least. Tut tut.",
