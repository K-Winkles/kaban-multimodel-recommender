Merrit, Edgar Rice Burroughs, H.G. Wells, Edgar Allan Poe, and just about every notable science fiction and fantasy writer of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Some really are tired and dried and have been strip-mined over the decades by other writers. Others are either fresh or nice to have on hand. Depending upon your tastes, there are either a few duds or lots of duds. For what you get for the price, however, you really can't go wrong with this purchase. Some, such as virtually all of the Poe and Merrit, I have read before, others works are ones I always wanted to get to. This collection will turn out to be a mining expedition for most readers. I've found stuff I never would have read otherwise. Bring your panning dish and set it to work. There is gold in them there hills!",
