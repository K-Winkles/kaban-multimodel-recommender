                "reviewText": "It is difficult to find new, reasonably priced copies of the Canterbury Classics series.This is a used/acceptable copy of Classic Tales of Science Fiction and Fantasy including some of the best & iconic authors of the 19th & 20th Centuries. These are the authors who paved the way for the Science Fiction we have today.The book arrived within 2 days, well-packed in an Amazon shipping box. It is in good shape with only a couple of flaws: it had a handwritten dedication in the front cover, and the binding was separating a little from having been read. The dedication was a nice quote from Shakespeare which I am happy to leave there. And I simply took some binding tape and repaired that one loose area.The stories are indeed Classics that should be in every young person's library. There are no illustrations, so the book is more on a teenage to adult level. I would estimate the print to be about 8pt, so if you wear progressive eyeglasses, you might need a magnifier. Fortunately, this is a gift for a pre-teen boy, so his eyesight should be able to handle it.Since I ordered this book used, I was well aware that it would have flaws. That's why I went ahead and gave it 5 stars, since it is filled with great literature, arrived quickly with no problems, and it was in decent used condition as expected.",
