I won't be giving anything away saying that ancient prehistoric worms are at the center of this story. It then becomes a matter of who has and who does not have worms. Nasty little parasites that change a persons inner self into a self serving quest to reproduce.The story was good...to a point where the guessing game became tedious and the outcome suspected. There is also talk of a military helicopter called an Osprey. It's actually a \" tilt rotor\" plane....not a helicopter.I'm being picky here but its an obvious mistake. Violence, death,shooting, burning and paranoid situations are all combined into this most disturbing novel.Now I need a Calvin and Hobbs series to calm down.",
