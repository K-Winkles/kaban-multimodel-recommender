                "reviewText": "A good story, worthy successor to the first installation.I'm not too fond of the manner in which Mr. Varnell includes characters with no sense of boundaries, but the involvement in this story is much more believable (not to mention less in depth) than his American Kitsune series. I hope he continues this trend.The growth of the characters are frankly quite excellent. It's not Tolkein by any means, but there are certain points of genius here. I like how the 'curse' (my word not his) that has plagued the protagonist's inventions seems to be wearing off, which I take to mean that having a partner is bringing back the inspiration/mojo/magic. Or maybe it's even more subtle, which is the point I really like; the answer isn't always obvious.The science angle is good too. Having a superheated sand gun is frankly a new one on me.Pacing overall is better in this second installment. There's much less Fourth Wall breakage (which is REALLY appreciated, if you read this Mr. Varnell), and the relationship is smoothly handled. Expanding the potential 'harem' looks to be improved in this tale; still a bit iffy on the step sister (despite the lack of blood ties), but the other characters appear to be working just fine.Worth a buy.",

                "reviewText": "Well, it looks like I was correct in assuming that \"A Most Unlikely Hero\" was based off the anime, \"To-Love-Ru.\"The story of Alex S. Ryker continues as things get more exciting and crazy for him. He and the lovely alien Princess Gabrielle continue to dabble in inventing, fun, and highly embarrassing, sexy moments.There's plenty of action, humor, science-fiction lingo, malfunctioning gadgets, sexiness, and destruction of public property to go around. In Vol. 2, we're introduced to a number of lovely girls with plenty of personality and potential, but Alex hasn't yet expressed much romance to any of them yet, not even Gabrielle. However, he IS starting to realize it. It's only a matter of time before his feelings become too much for him to hide.It would also seem that Alex has a hidden secret that not even he himself is aware of. Something about his past and/or family.Though short, this volume was another good read in the series, and the illustrations by XuaHanNin are VERY lovely.",
