                "reviewText": "This book of fantasy reads like the first draft of a one long, loosely connected short story to this reader. I felt the writer was improving her story telling with each chapter. The narrative in the first two stories sets the scene for the time travel but they pale in comparison with the third part of the book and its compelling emotional tale. I. Would suggest that one of the 3 stories, preferably the last one be the content of the whole book with more complete character development and more story instead of three rather incomplete and underdeveloped stories that are not very engaging.By keeping the best story, in my view, the last, the author wastes the time and interest of the reader with such a lot of focus on insignificant characters, such as the ghost woman occupying the chair and the lengthy description of the rules of the experience.and less touching story lines, resulting in the reader not really made to care or be empathetic to the characters. The early mentioned parts of the narrative do not figure importantly in the eventual telling of the most important tale of. A cafe with a magical chair.Perhaps. Something is lost in translation. But I would like the author to take the last story snd write a real fantasy about Kei basing her book solely around that very touching story.",

                "reviewText": "This is a heartwarming, poignant, and somewhat mystical exploration of human relationships, regrets, love, and the concept of time. It is a reminder of both the constraints and the possibilities of time, presented through an unassuming yet magical setting - a small, traditional Japanese caf\u00e9.The story takes place in a Tokyo coffee shop, where patrons are given a unique opportunity: to travel in time. However, this is not your typical time-travel story. The rules are strict and somewhat peculiar: you must sit in one specific seat, you can't change the present, and you must return before the coffee gets cold. These rules add a distinctive charm to the story and provide a unique perspective on the concept of time travel.Kawaguchi writes four interconnected stories, each focusing on a different character who seeks to visit a moment in their past/future. The desires of these characters to rectify a regret, to reconnect, to communicate, are moving and relatable. Their narratives are carefully woven together, creating a tapestry that speaks to the interconnectedness of human lives.The writing style is simple, clear, and direct, allowing the emotions of the characters and the moral implications of their journeys to shine through. Some might find this style a bit too plain, and at times, it might seem that the narrative lacks the depth or complexity that could have made the characters more fully realized. However, it can also be argued that the simplicity of the prose mirrors the mundane yet magical setting of the caf\u00e9 and the straightforward yet profound dilemmas the characters face.One aspect where the book could have been better is in its pacing. At times, the story tends to slow down, which might test the patience of some readers. Furthermore, while the book's concept is intriguing, the strict rules of time travel somewhat limit the exploration of its potential. However, it's clear that the author's intention was not to write a sci-fi story about time travel but rather to use it as a device to explore themes of regret, acceptance, and the value of the present.Overall, thought-provoking, touching, and unique read. It explores the human condition through a unique lens, offering readers a chance to reflect on their own lives and the choices they've made. Despite minor flaws, the book's emotional resonance, intriguing premise, and memorable characters make it a worthwhile read. This is a book for anyone who enjoys introspective storytelling, as well as those who appreciate a fresh take on well-worn themes.",

I thought this was going to be a sad read for me since others said they cried their eyes out reading it. For me, I didn\u2019t really get into it until about sixty percent through.I found it hard to know who was saying what at times. I feel like the characters were all thrown at me at once and it was hard to keep track of who was who until I got toward the end. The husband and wife part was sad but it didn\u2019t make me cry.I would say this is still an emotional read and I think the message behind it is good. I would still recommend this read even though I gave it three stars!",
