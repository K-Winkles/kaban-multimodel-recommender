                "reviewText": "\u2022 What starts off as a tale of a simple New England farmer discovering a meteor in his field in 1783 begins turning the reader\u2019s head inside out from the first chapter. The pace is quick and delicious, with a very believable FBI agent taking the role of protagonist. I like time-travel stories, and this one is well done.\u2022 I love the premise of this book because it takes time traveling to the level of a national crime. A gold bar worth hundreds of thousands of dollars mysteriously shows up outside the impenetrable Fort Knox, but it\u2019s a gold bar that\u2019s known to have been taken from *INSIDE* the tightly secured facility. The real mystery begins here and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end, with the tale taking the reader through a secret kept since the founding of the United States. The protagonist, FBI Special Agent Brad Holman, crisscrosses the nation & time trying to nail down a thief who eludes every trap laid for him. The mystery of how the thief gets in & out so quickly in some seemingly impossible situations is done well, as are the FBI agent\u2019s reactions and countermeasures.\u2022 The author ramps up the tension by slowly exposing a much larger, more dangerous world-ending catastrophe with the characters racing to stop it from happening. At times, it can get a bit confusing with multiple persons jumping back & forth in time, but the ending effect is worth it.\u2022 Author Darling weaves many places and military knowledge/insights into the story, which helps bring the science fiction to life in very real ways.",

                "reviewText": "An amazing book! What really got me hooked was the believability and the work the author obviously did on the research side to understand the mechanics of time travel. I should say the theory of time travel.His characters are easy to understand and empathize with. You can see where they get their motivation. I really enjoyed the characters stuck in what I call the \u201cin between\u201d. If you\u2019re a fan of time, travel, or people who are out of time, this book is one to add to your shelf.It could be possibly better than Michael Creighton\u2019s \u201ctimeline\u201d",

                "reviewText": "I read and enjoyed all of the author\u2019s Noah Hunter books, but as I\u2019m not a fan of sci-fi hadn\u2019t planned to read Edge of Time. Once I learned the premise of the novel, though, wherein an FBI agent travels through time to save the world, my curiosity was piqued, and now having finished it I have to praise David Darling on his well-paced and exciting storytelling \u2013 yet again! Edge of Time perfectly combines crime-solving and sci-fi, much like the television show Fringe used to do, and I enjoyed this novel just as much.",
