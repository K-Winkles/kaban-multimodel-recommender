I haven't read anything from this author before, and I really enjoyed this story. Ugene was a very unique character, and found himself not fitting in. I like the premise that anyone without \"powers\" isn't \"normal.\" This may be tailored to the young adult, but I liked this read. It's more than just about fitting in or not fitting in, within the world around you, but a journey as well. Ugene discovers more about himself, flaws and perfections and everything in between. It's a unique world, and a very great read. The story brings in the believable, even if almost impossible. I have fast become a big fan of Davies. I look forward to reading more by this author. This book is a definite recommendation by Amy's Bookshelf Reviews.I received this book free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. ~Amy's Bookshelf Reviews",

Besides a few more than convenient twists and predictable turns, this was an enjoyable adventure that leaves you curious about the next book and what else can possibly go wrong (in an adventurous sort of way). The government gives you Hunger Game vibes without all the glamor and such but all of the twisting of stories to suit agendas. A unique book that if the description has you curious you should just pick it up and be prepared to not put it down!Narrator: inconsistent in differing between characters, their accents change without switching characters.Parents this is not for under 14Language: mild cussingViolence: tasering, imprisonment, murderSexual content: is pretty mild in book 1, same-sex relationship but no details\u2014I was given this free review copy audiobook at my request and have voluntarily left this review.",

I think popular comparisons like The Hunger Games or Divergent might spring to mind but the powers in this world also made me think of Below the Root. Ugene is definitely a strong main character you will root for -- but Celeste has my heart! I adore her.If you want to be swept away by a story and settle into a new world, this one will grab and immerse you!",

The writing captivated me, and pulled me into the story, in a way that most of the books I have picked up recently haven't been able to do.Solid writing, a great world that doesn't have so much world building that it slows down the story, but it includes enough that you get a glimpse of the world that leaves you wanting more.The main reason I give this four stars, rather than five, was that I felt that we're introduced to a large cast nearly midway through the book that I feel we never really get to know. It seemed like the right place and reasons to bring these characters in, I just would have liked a little more depth to them, as I struggled to have any sense of who was who, or feel any connection to them.Overall, this is a great first book in the series, and I can't wait to read what happens next!",

The world in Ordinary has been cleverly woven with a diverse and intriguing cast of characters - including my favourite trope of the morally grey woman in power. The tension within Ugene's story was palpable and it frequently felt like I was right there with him.An absolutely fantastic read, especially for lovers of dystopias.",
