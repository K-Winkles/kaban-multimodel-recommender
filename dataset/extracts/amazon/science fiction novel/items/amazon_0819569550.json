                "reviewText": "This book comes closer to being The Definitive Science Fiction Anthology than any other book ever published. Over the decades, other editors have attempted to create a definitive anthology of this genre but not achieved that goal. If you could only get one science fiction anthology, this would be the one to get. I would further supplement this book with the following ones:_The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: Volume One, 1929-1964_, edited by Robert Silverberg._The Best of the Nebulas_, edited by Ben Bova (basically a continuation of the _Hall of Fame_ covering the years 1965-1985)._A Science Fiction Argosy_, edited by Damon Knight._The World Treasury of Science Fiction_, edited by David G. Hartwell._The Ascent of Wonder_, edited by David G. Hartwell and Kathryn Cramer._Adventures in Time and Space_, edited by Raymond J. Healy and Francis J. McComas.and the four main Groff Conklin anthologies.Unfortunately, of all these books, only _The Science Fiction Hall of Fame_ is still in print. Fortunately, Volume One of that series is still the second-best science fiction anthology ever published. At the time of its publication, it really was the best and most definitive anthology of the genre. But it was published many decades ago and limited to the period 1929-1964. So now, that distinction falls to this book, _The Wesleyan Anthology of Science Fiction_.",

You'll know them (or at least, you SHOULD) and/or you'll be so accustomed to the tropes that it may not hold that much interest. Still, there's a couple of stories that I guarantee you HAVEN'T read and will be glad you did later.",

I've heard about many of the short stories included in this volume, many of them have been the basis for huge blockbuster movies. Take \"We Can Remember It For You Wholesale\" by Phillip K Dick, that short story more or less inspired the film \"Total Recall\". You have stories that stick with you like \"Burning Chrome\" by William Gibson, the man credited with coining the term 'cybersapce'. If you're a fan of Black Mirror or just want to know what real, good, top shelf science fiction is, I whole-heartedly recommend this.",
