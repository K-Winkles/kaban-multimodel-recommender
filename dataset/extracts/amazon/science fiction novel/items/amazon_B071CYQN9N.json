I lost my library of books just over a decade ago. Among them were many classic Sci Fi writers. Asminov, Norton. Clark, Niven & many others. I must say though I have read some contemporary Sci Fi but I like the science fiction I grew up on from the early 60s on. I am now on a quest to find those grand old books buy & read them again. They will be like old friends long lost coming to know them once again. They are classic Science Fiction for a reason. The have stood test of time & found not wanting. Read them for those Sci Fi writers stand on the shoulders of those giants. Find out what made today's writers want be the next generation of writers by reading those books.",

I first read it years ago and it still holds interest the same way. However, I will say that the Kindle version of this book and all the others available from Amazon (Grey Lensman is not available on Kindle as yet) have the worst typo's and print errors including missed sentences and paragraphs I have ever seen in any books on Kindle. They should get their act together and get some proofreaders. Knowing the books as well as I do, it is easy to spot missing lines, but the typos are major.",

So if you don't mind the comic book style of writing with super heroic shenanigans then you will enjoy this series as well.",

The first of the Lensman series that has inspired other science fiction authors for generations. The command, control, communication, and Intelligence architectures directly inspired command centers of our aircraft carriers and Aegis cruisers of today. Don't expect a dumbed down vocabulary, or modern flowing prose, as the author was a Ph.D. chemist of great erudition, and wrote in that style. The series predicted stealth, directed energy weapons, atomic power and weapons, ABM systems, and more. Great fun.",

But it's a superbly paced, lots of (made up) science and ultimately good morality conquers all. If you can get past the elements that dated in the last near-century you still won't learn anything deep but it's so much FUN I'm surprised Hollywood haven't made a sucky version of it yet.",

                "reviewText": "To the modern younger audience for SF I suppose these books must seem a little naive, as primitive as cave paintings compared to the works of art in display at the Tate. For me they are the fundamental precursor to be valued as, forgive the pun, the foundations of contemporary additions to the genre. Likely this is possibly a jaundiced view from a nostalgic perspective but to be reunited with this franchise is a joyous occasion of a childhood reunion with dog-eared companions of yore. True they may lack a certain political correctness, hold to values of another era which jar and jostle with today, still they possess a sense of the epic, unambiguous shades of black and white, where villains are villains and damsels are rescued from their black clutches by heroes of strength and valour.",

It is impossible to give a representative abstract. Must be read! I have read this series maybe 10 times! Maravilhoso! as we say in Portugal.",
