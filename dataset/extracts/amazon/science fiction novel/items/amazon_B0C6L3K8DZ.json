From the very first pages, I already cared about the characters--smart, vulnerable/confident, passionate, and devoted to the greater good. The author also does a wonderful job of making complex science and math understandable, even to a tech T-rex like me. I also love the pinging of \"homespun\" and wider geosocial philosophy, written in such a low-key, totally non-pedantic yet impactful way. I found myself rereading and highlighting because they resonated so much, and said in ways I haven't seen before. Can't wait to read all the complete series!!",
