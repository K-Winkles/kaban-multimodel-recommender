                "reviewText": "Ever since I was a young boy I loved reading books and early comic books written by H.G. Wells and even though I had read this original book (which was published first in 1898) and saw two versions of the movie made of this book (H.G. Well\u2019s the war of the worlds); nevertheless, I decided to order the graphic novel version (Katherine McLean Brevard) of this great science fiction story.This new graphic treatment of the classics is designed for \u201creluctant readers\u201d and they are very educational because they include both reading questions and writing questions at the end this story. It also has a glossary. I think this graphic novel is a good learning tool for beginning readers or those who have trouble understanding the regular novel.I admit to loving this graphic novel which of course follows the same tale of evil aliens from Mars who want to take over Earth because their planet is dying. Since they are more advanced than humans and we cannot beat them with our weapons are we doomed? Read this graphic novel to find out.Rating: 5 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Martial Art and Warrior Haiku and Senryu).",
