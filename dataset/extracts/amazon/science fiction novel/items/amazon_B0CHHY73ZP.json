While the mating was an integral part of the story line, the out of left field female annoyed me. Not the character but the close relationship to prominent breed characters. I hate when a character is added at such an immense part of a previous characters life but there has never been mention of them what so ever. I do like the revelations and what could come from them but here again I have so many questions. I thought breeds could only reproduce with their mates? If so, how did 3 female hybrids with genetic flaming come to be, including the female mate character? And of course as one reader was afraid of the whole pining for Harmony was basically wiped away. Very small reference to it as it was poopooed away as nothing when the ongoing story line was him hiding and pining. Ugh, And how did Callen suddenly appear when he was not anywhere near Broken Butte? Time travel? All in all if you are a breed fan you need to read this book. Lots of history revealed and a future that is most definitely going to be full of challenges.",

                "reviewText": "When the book prior to this one was published and nothing came after I was sad because it couldn't end that way. At least in my mind. This story about Dane and Katelyn was heartbreaking, loving, adventurous and the mystery behind who the new threat is had me reading this book in less than a day! From the way the storyline went I'm hoping that we get more books! The way its written I feel as if I can visit every place and get to meet these amazing people. The dangers the breeds face are no less than what they were six years ago, but now the risks are higher and finding a mate seems both impossible and imperative. I secretly have my fingers crossed that we can see a book for David!",

Katy had know Dane for several years and was attracted to him, but she was too young for him and he thought he would never mate. He couldn't tell she was his mate. When they finally got together 8 years later, they slept together, but no mating occured. It was only when she saw him with someone else, she collapsed in pain. Graeme almost killed her to spare her the pain and it was killing him as he loved her as a daughter. I won't tell anymore so I won't spoil the surprise, but this book is excellent and well worth your time",

I am so happy Dane got his story told and that we finally see him with someone else instead of following his old lover around like a lost puppy...really couldn't picture him like that any more...Glad his story leads to more future entertainment from the Breeds.

Katy is an amazing female lead always teased as being more, and Dane well we have known him since the very early books as the spoiled heir of the Vanderale Empire. This book didn't disappoint bringing in familiar names from previous books was nice to see as well the character of Graeme Parker to stir things up is always interesting. The new characters promise to be fun shining a light on some of the complex history of the breeds that I didn't see coming. This book was worth the wait and most definitely fun reading.

The fact she expanded the facts of the beginning to the breads and the revel of some new fact is one that I cannot wait to read more on. I cannot wait for more in all of this but just have to wait.

She is strong, sweet, and resilient, with a core of true grit and grace that is hard to maintain with the life she has lived. And Dane finally lets his carefully crafted facade slip to reveal the loving, gentle soul buried within. Together with the support of some unexpected characters, these two have ushered in a new life for the Breeds.

The only issue that I have with this book is that I want more. I feel like I didn\u2019t get enough story. I can\u2019t wait for the next one, whenever it comes.",
