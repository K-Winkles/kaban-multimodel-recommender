I continue to find Blake Crouch interesting and plan to read more of his books in the future.Dr. Helena Smith accidentally creates a time machine when she is building a total immersion gamer system for a game company and does not even realize it. Her assistant realizes that Dr. Smith has built a time machine, imprints himself with a impressive earlier memory, and kills himself. He wakes up in his earlier self and starts rebuilding the time machine.The time machine only runs in reverse to an earlier event in your life that you can easily remember. Such as a new car, the birth of a child, the death of a child, etc. But, the kicker is that the entire planet moves backwards with you in time but, they do not remember where they were before the move back until they reach the time where you activated the time machine. Move backs of a few days are hardly noticed by the population. But move backs of forty years are very much noticed by the population. And everyone wants their own time machine and in that way lies a horrible future.The book moves very slowly to start. Then at the midpoint, it starts moving very quickly with all the jumping around in time. The book is being made into a series on Netflix.",

Crouch is able to develop a very compelling story and play with the concept of time travel in new and exciting way I had not seen before. The book takes place in a handful of locations but two of the locations are New Jersey and Colorado which added an extra fun touch to this novel for me as that was where I was from and where I was traveling to while reading it.The book made the flight pass by quickly and left me wanting to continue reading to see what would happen next.The only downside to the book for me would be it flubs the landing slightly and struggles to close out the story it set up so well. It doesn't take away from the artfully crafted story that was told through out the book but if I had one criticism that would be it.If you like scfi and time travel this novel is for you.",

None the less, it was a good read. I enjoyed the characters, and story line. It jumps between different peoples perspectives and I never found it confusing or hard to follow. One thing I didn\u2019t like was that it didn\u2019t have chapters, rather it more so ended and restarted when changing between the characters perspectives. I prefer chapters.",
