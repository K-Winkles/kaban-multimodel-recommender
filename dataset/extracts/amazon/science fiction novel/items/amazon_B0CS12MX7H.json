        "description": "What would you do if you were a fallen samurai? (Fantasy short story 2024).Syou was an outstanding samurai whose praises were sung by all, but one day he became an outcast. Shunned, despised, rejected. An outcast, whose touch is considered a stain. Despite this, he tries to survive as best he can, living in a makeshift camp and fighting bandits, but his life has become a living hell. A real hell.However, unexpected news changes all his plans and pushes him in a direction he'd never imagined, forcing him to confront his old demons and succeed in an impossible mission in the hope of one day being forgiven. And thus become the samurai emeritus he once was.In the fantasy genre, let yourself be carried away by the adventures of Syou, fighting for redemption in a world where the distinction between good and evil has become blurred (a clever blend of fantasy, pirate and dystopian novels).So don't wait any longer, buy \"YURUSHI : A new hope\" now to find out what's going to happen to Edda and, above all, to her mysterious creature.
