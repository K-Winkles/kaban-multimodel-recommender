This is that book. It is so funny, so epic, and the characters are delightful. The only complaint I have is that we stayed up late reading every night because we just couldn't put it down! This book is a 10/10, and I can't wait to read the next installment.",

                "reviewText": "What do you get when you take the best-selling author Mac Barnett, the Caldecott Honor award-winning illustrator Shawn Harris, and let them work on a project together while everyone is sheltering in place during 2020? A live-action cartoon featuring the first cat in space, of course! And after the episodes have received thousands of views - the mandate of the people is that the story must be made into a graphic novel of epic adventure! At long last that project is coming to store shelves and online retailers so that we can all enjoy it even when the Internet is down.After astronomers discover that rats are actually eating the moon, a top secret mission launches the first cat in space to solve the problem. Accompanied by a toenail-clipping robot and the queen of the moon, our intrepid hero must face rats from another galaxy and all the dangers inside their secret base on the dark side of the moon. The hearty adventurers travel through the Land of Frost and the Peninsula of Thunder, meet the man in the moon and a three-headed rat king, and make allies and enemies along the way. But with only three days to save the moon, will they succeed?Fans of Dog Man, The Flying Beaver Brothers, and similar humorous graphic novels for middle grade readers will have a new favorite book to read and talk over with friends. The commander at Earth's Hexagon (military headquarters) comes up with silly phrases such as, \"Oh my grammy's meat loaf\" or \"Oh my wrinkly pinkie toe\" and his assistant Dr.Milksop always says, \"My thoughts exactly, sir.\" His outbursts remind me of Stone Rabbit exclaiming, \"Crud monkeys!\"Once readers reach the end of the book, they may enjoy having a watch party of the live cartoon episodes to see where the story began. And there are hints that a second book may happen. \"Oh my mama llama.\"",
