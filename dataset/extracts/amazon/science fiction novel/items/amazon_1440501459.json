There were no notes inside.I ordered this alongside a few other creative writing fantasy books because I've had multiple creative writing courses and none allowed fantasy. So with that said, this is more of a literal beginning point. It overviews the basics of fantasy, and it doesnt include any writing technique or heavy story building guides. There are no prompts. This is what you read before you even begin your work, and if you have not had any courses, and if you are brand new to fantasy. If you feel you are overwhelmed, I think this would be helpful to recenter yourself.I read this alongside Putting the Fact in Fantasy, and I believe that book would follow this one pretty nicely. This being a beginning, and Fact in Fantasy being a more inspiring read for when you're ready to create your fantasy world and characters, but needed a lil direction.",

                "reviewText": "Overall a decent read... I ate it up in a couple of days. There are certainly some solid pieces of advise on a variety of things, and the author has a good sense of humour (I guess you'd have to trying to make a living in this genre).It does in my opinion weigh a bit more to the Fantasy side of things, than the Sci-fi side, but that didn't bother me personally.What I didn't like is that it's fairly vague on some major issues. The section on publishing was very high-level, what one would expect in a \"Publishing for Dummies\" book. The guy is (was) an insider, so I wanted a few more juicy tidbits and secrets. He only hinted at some brutal realities in the industry, so I wonder if the editor held him back there. Regardless, I started reading his blog, which is a bit more bold and answers more questions.A solid 4 stars.",

It is easy to reference the sections you want. It covers everything from plot, characters, world-building, to publishing. Really, it covers it all.

I finally got around to reading it, and thoroughly enjoyed it. The introduction by R.S. Salvatore and the first chapter by Athans convinced me that the rest of the book would definitely be worth a read. It sounds like just what I need to help me with a story I've begun sketching out and plan to start writing soon.So, after reading the sample, I tried to buy the book on my Kindle only to get a message that the book was not available. I looked at the website, and it was indeed not available on Kindle. Not available anymore, anyway. It was when I downloaded the sample. I guess between now and then the publisher decided to yank it. (Just from Kindle, though, since I've found it on other sites, in formats I can't read on the Kindle but can read on other devices.)I've ordered the hard copy version, which is \"shipping soon,\" and I may be reading it by the end of the week. In the meantime, I'm already reading another similar book that is available on Kindle now.",

I've learned more about how to keep on writing even when I feel stuck, how to liven things up, how to evaluate my progress, and how to direct my efforts when revising. The guide reads like a personal conversation with an expert. Grab a drink, get ready to take notes, and make like a sponge to soak up wisdom from a collection of well-respected professionals.",

It was a relatively quick read, and went into several aspects including character, world building and plot.My only gripe would perhaps be that because so many areas were covered, there was relatively little depth in any of them. The book was not too long that elaboration would be too much. Nevertheless I enjoyed it, and many queries I had were answered (and, at \u00a30.99, it's a bargain!)",
