                "reviewText": "Freaking SpectacularReady Player One is one heck of a great book. Freakishly great. My initial reaction after finishing it was that it is a Hall of Fame inductee. Yeah... it was that good.Oh - and I should mention that I was very honored to learn that my scores of review groupies voted me the greatest reviewer of all time. The usual response to something like that would be to say \"I'm humbled.\" You know... that is what you always hear from sports figures, actors, and politicians when the win something. \"I'm very humbled... \" they say. Was I humbled? Heck no! That word isn't even in my dictionary! You are darn right I'm the greatest reviewer of all time! Humbled? Bah... more like - what took you so long to figure that out?! I mean what the heck... isn't it obvious? There should be two categories of reviews on Amazon. One for Moondonkey, and one for everyone else. In fact, Amazon should put a \"Moondonkey\" option under the search menu. Anyway... thank you for the honor. Yes, I am the greatest reviewer of all time.Back to Ready Player One. You know - I suppose it helped that I grew up in the 80's and could recognize most of the references. In fact, I think I have The Tomb of Horrors in my basement somewhere. I looked up the image on Goggle and was like... Dude... I think I've got that. Why do I have that? Because I'm Moondonkey, that's why! Why wouldn't I have it?I heard that they might make this book into a movie. If they do, I hope they don't themselves too seriously and just let it fly. If done right, it would be hilarious. If not, something like this could easily go off the tracks. However, to do it correctly, I suspect that the producers would have to get the rights to use material from a lot of sources - Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica just to name a few. The final battle is a perfect example... ideally you would want ships from all three flying around blowing stuff up.I imagine the film starting with some green Apple IIe letters on a black screen - something to introduce the audience to the basic plot details. Then a cut to black and an awesome 80's song. Not sure which song- I'm open to suggestions (BTW - anyone else surprised that Mr. Roboto wasn't mentioned in the book?). I don't think that would be a good intro though... it has to be something fast-paced with a big punch right off the bat. FADE IN ...How about Journey - Don't Stop Believin' for starting at the final scene and rolling into the credits. Awesome.Bonnie Tyler - Holding Out for a Hero. Maybe for final battle between Z and Sorrento while stuff blows up all over the place. Awesome.The intro is the tough one. It has to punch you in the face right away.... Just like the Star Wars into does... BAM! I was thinking maybe The Cars - Magic, but I don't know... I'm just not sold on it. I also looked at selections from Cinderella, Poison, and Bon Jovi. Not sure about those either. I even looked at the author's website, where he has a \"playlist\" of songs listed. Frankly, I didn't see anything that would make a good intro. Billy Idol? Anvil of Crom has a particular appeal, but it starts slow and was already used in Conan.Another song with some merit is Kenny Loggins - Danger Zone. Except that it is a Top Gun song. However, if you listen to the beat of Danger Zone and Magic, you get the idea. Fast paced. Upbeat.Hmmm... perhaps Holding Out for a Hero would work for the intro... maybe use it again during the last battle when Z has his \"Neo\" moment and turns to face the enemy. I think the beginning would have to be rewritten though... action right away.Oh - and the big robot that Z uses at the end (whatever the name is)... I Googled an image of that thing and I don't think it works. First, too cheesey. Second, too obscure. Change it up. My vote is for Unicron instead.I don't think that sticking strictly to songs mentioned in the book is a good idea.UPDATE 3/26/2015So I hear Steven Spielberg is going to direct Ready Player One. Frankly, that\u2019s about as good of a choice as any given his background. However, I still have a hard time trusting him not to screw it up. Therefore, I\u2019ve taken the liberty to write me own screen play for the film\u2026 well maybe not an entire screen play\u2026 or maybe even very much of what would generally pass for a screen play\u2026 but I did spend some serious time in front of my computer screening music and considering scenes. What? That\u2019s crazy? Hey \u2013 it is more than you did so stop talking and let me finish\u2026Here is the problem \u2013 some of the content of the book is just too \u201cgeek fringe\u201d for a good film. Did I just invent that term? Probably, I\u2019m on the cutting edge of pop culture you know. I should trademark that. For example, Rush 2112 is just too far out there to be effective.So here are some thoughts in no particular order:One thing I\u2019d add would be a Roller Rink scene with Z and Art3mis. There is a part in the book when they are sort of \u201cdating\u201d (but not really). I envision a compilation of Z and Art3mis doing \u201ctogether\u201d type activities set to REO Speedwagon Can\u2019t Fight This Feeling. However, the first chorus of the song (at exactly 1:29) MUST climax to an initial shot of a disco ball on a ceiling and then pan down to the two of them doing a couples skate at a virtual roller rink. Or perhaps we see the ball first, then a shot of hands holding followed by a pan out to the larger rink. I mean come on \u2013 who didn\u2019t couples skate to REO Speedwagon in the 80\u2019s?Another one - when Z and Art3mis dance at Og\u2019s party\u2026 how about Forever Young by Alphaville? Yeah\u2026 I know\u2026 amazing huh?I\u2019m still a fan of using Holding Out for a Hero by Bonnie Tyler to intro the film. Read the following while playing the song and stick with me here\u2026 No, I\u2019m serious. Print out this review and hold it in your hand while listening to the song.I\u2019m waiting\u2026Ok\u2026 are you ready now?FADE IN to \u201cReady Player One .\u201d in green Apple IIe letters on a black screen. The period at the end is flashing on and off. (cue the music)INTERIOR DOCKING BAY (first stanza\u2026. Da\u2026da\u2026.da..da..da\u2026.. at .06)) Close-up shot of boots walking (space pilot in suit) (second stanza\u2026Da\u2026da\u2026da..da..da\u2026 at .09) Close-up shot adjusting space gloves\u2026 (third stanza\u2026Da\u2026da\u2026.da\u2026da.da\u2026 at .12) Close up shot of name tag on uniformed chest \u201cParzival\u201dThen we see the back of the pilot climbing a ladder and getting into an 80\u2019s version Battlestar Galactica fighter. Pilot adjusts controls, prepares for flights, etc\u2026 hand pushes forward accelerator.(music \u2013 intense drumbeat\u2026.Dadadadadadadaadadad at .30 seconds) \u2013 ship blasts through launch tunnel and out into space\u2026As the Battlestar Galactica fades in distance in field of stars, Z is initially alone in space for perhaps 5-10 seconds. Then, at around the .40 to .45 mark he is intercepted by some Star Wars X-Wing fighters or something. Ships engage thrusters and fly into battle with various other ships\u2026Where have all the good men goneAnd where are all the gods?Where's the street-wise HerculesTo fight the rising odds?Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?Late at night I toss and I turn and I dreamof what I need(chorus)Z fires to the pace of the drumbeat at .55-.56 (music\u2026dum\u2026dum..dee\u2026dum\u2026dum\u2026dee\u2026dum)\u2026(music\u2026 \u201cI need a hero\u2026. Symbol clash!)\u2026 Target ship explodes at .58-.59 (like a tie fighter exploding in Star Wars) and Z\u2019s ship flights through the cloud immediately after, but before the vocals kick in again. Maybe it could have even been Aech joining him and blowing up the enemy to save his butt or something. \u2026(lyrics)\u2026I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the nightHe's gotta be strongAnd he's gotta be fastAnd he's gotta be fresh from the fightI need a hero \u2026EXTERIOR \u2013 (symbol clash!)\u2026Z blasts another ship in pace with the music\u2026at 1.11\u2026(lyrics)\u2026I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning lightHe's gotta be sureAnd it's gotta be soonAnd he's gotta be larger than life\u2026..Then we see Aech and Z in a larger battle scene filled with ships from Star Trek, Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, Babylon 5, etc. Maybe even some transformers and other robots flying around.Take it from there\u2026Does this match the intro of the book? No. But there is no immediate spark at the book\u2019s beginning. A Ready Player One movie should intro like Star Wars \u2013 A New Hope \u2026Bam! Right into the action. Or Goonies \u2013 where the intro is a jail escape and chase to music. This should be like that. Are you reading this Spielberg? You should be. You should probably be making me a job offer this is so good.I\u2019ve considered how to explain Z having the resources to be in this environment at the beginning. I don\u2019t know\u2026 maybe Aech brought him along on a \u201cquest\u201d or invited him to play an online \u201cgame\u201d with him. The scene could end with Z thanking Aech for the opportunity or something.The point of this is that the intensity of the opening scene can be matched at the end when Z turns to face Sorrento and then becomes Ultraman. Again\u2026 que the music and open the can\u2026The key to the Ultraman battle sequence (I still think Unicron is a better choice) is not the fight itself\u2026 it is the personality of the characters in that moment. Think Darth Vader in Empire. It is about the personality behind the mask.Again\u2026 the following from Holding Out for a Hero:\u2026(lyrics)Somewhere after midnightIn my wildest fantasySomewhere just beyond my reachThere's someone reaching back for meRacing on the thunder and rising with the heatIt's gonna take a superman to sweep me off my feet\u2026We hear the last part as the camera pans back to Art3mis watching the fight and we can see in her character that she has fallen for Z as she watches him rail against Sorrento in a match to the death\u2026 I imagine a zoom shot of Art3mis\u2026 maybe in her robot suit\u2026 maybe not\u2026 but the shot MIMICS the VADER shot at the end of Jedi when Vader weighs his choice between Luke and the Emperor\u2026 The intensity of that last scene in Star Wars was not the duel, it was the conflict that we saw in Vader\u2019s eyes \u2013 even without seeing his eyes. In fact, this scene could be a a blatent imitation of that scene... this is an homage to 80's pop culture, right? Personally, I\u2019d prefer that Art3mis still be in robot form and the camera focusing on the blank lenses of the robot eyes\u2026 yet implying sight behind the eyes as she watches Z in battle\u2026",

                "reviewText": "By the mid-21st century, the Internet has become largely subsumed as the transport layer for the OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation), a massively multiuser online virtual reality environment originally developed as a multiplayer game, but which rapidly evolved into a platform for commerce, education, social interaction, and entertainment used by billions of people around the world. The OASIS supports immersive virtual reality, limited only by the user's budget for hardware used to access the network. With top-of-the-line visors and sound systems, body motion sensors, and haptic feedback, coupled to a powerful interface console, a highly faithful experience was possible. The OASIS was the creation of James Halliday, a legendary super-nerd who made his first fortune designing videogames for home computers in the 1980s, and then re-launched his company in 2012 as Gregarious Simulation Systems (GSS), with the OASIS as its sole product. The OASIS was entirely open source: users could change things within the multitude of worlds within the system (within the limits set by those who created them), or create their own new worlds. Using a distributed computing architecture which pushed much of the processing power to the edge of the network, on users' own consoles, the system was able to grow without bound without requiring commensurate growth in GSS data centres. And it was free, or almost so. To access the OASIS, you paid only a one-time lifetime sign-up fee of twenty-five cents, just like the quarter you used to drop into the slot of an arcade videogame. Users paid nothing to use the OASIS itself: their only costs were the hardware they used to connect (which varied widely in cost and quality of the experience) and the bandwidth to connect to the network. But since most of the processing was done locally, the latter cost was modest. GSS made its money selling or renting virtual real estate (\u201csurreal estate\u201d) within the simulation. If you wanted to open, say, a shopping mall or build your own Fortress of Solitude on an asteroid, you had to pay GSS for the territory. GSS also sold virtual goods: clothes, magical artefacts, weapons, vehicles of all kinds, and buildings. Most were modestly priced, but since they cost nothing to manufacture, were pure profit to the company.As the OASIS permeated society, GSS prospered. Halliday remained the majority shareholder in the company, having bought back the share once owned by his co-founder and partner Ogden (\u201cOg\u201d) Morrow, after what was rumoured to be a dispute between the two the details of which had never been revealed. By 2040, Halliday's fortune, almost all in GSS stock, had grown to more than two hundred and forty billion dollars. And then, after fifteen years of self-imposed isolation which some said was due to insanity, Halliday died of cancer. He was a bachelor, with no living relatives, no heirs, and, it was said, no friends. His death was announced on the OASIS in a five minute video titled Anaorak's Invitation (\u201cAnorak\u201d was the name of Halliday's all-powerful avatar within the OASIS). In the film, Halliday announces that his will places his entire fortune in escrow until somebody completes the quest he has programmed within the OASIS:\u201cThree hidden keys open three secret gates,Wherein the errant will be tested for worthy traits,And those with the skill to survive these straits,Will reach The End where the prize awaits.\u201dThe prize is Halliday's entire fortune and, with it, super-user control of the principal medium of human interaction, business, and even politics. Before fading out, Halliday shows three keys: copper, jade, and crystal, which must be obtained to open the three gates. Only after passing through the gates and passing the tests within them, will the intrepid paladin obtain the Easter egg hidden within the OASIS and gain control of it. Halliday provided a link to Anorak's Almanac, more than a thousand pages of journal entries made during his life, many of which reflect his obsession with 1980s popular culture, science fiction and fantasy, videogames, movies, music, and comic books. The clues to finding the keys and the Egg were widely believed to be within this rambling, disjointed document.Given the stakes, and the contest's being open to anybody in the OASIS, what immediately came to be called the Hunt became a social phenomenon, all-consuming to some. Egg hunters, or \u201cgunters\u201d, immersed themselves in Halliday's journal and every pop culture reference within it, however obscure. All of this material was freely available on the OASIS, and gunters memorised every detail of anything which had caught Halliday's attention. As time passed, and nobody succeeded in finding even the copper key (Halliday's memorial site displayed a scoreboard of those who achieved goals in the Hunt, so far blank), many lost interest in the Hunt, but a dedicated hard core persisted, often to the exclusion of all other diversions. Some gunters banded together into \u201cclans\u201d, some very large, agreeing to exchange information and, if one found the Egg, to share the proceeds with all members. More sinister were the activities of Innovative Online Industries\u2014IOI\u2014a global Internet and communications company which controlled much of the backbone that underlay the OASIS. It had assembled a large team of paid employees, backed by the research and database facilities of IOI, with their sole mission to find the Egg and turn control of the OASIS over to IOI. These players, all with identical avatars and names consisting of their six-digit IOI employee numbers, all of which began with the digit \u201c6\u201d, were called \u201csixers\u201d or, more often in the gunter argot, \u201cSux0rz\u201d.Gunters detested IOI and the sixers, because it was no secret that if they found the Egg, IOI's intention was to close the architecture of the OASIS, begin to charge fees for access, plaster everything with advertising, destroy anonymity, snoop indiscriminately, and use their monopoly power to put their thumb on the scale of all forms of communication including political discourse. (Fortunately, that couldn't happen to us with today's enlightened, progressive Silicon Valley overlords.) But IOI's financial resources were such that whenever a rare and powerful magical artefact (many of which had been created by Halliday in the original OASIS, usually requiring the completion of a quest to obtain, but freely transferrable thereafter) came up for auction, IOI was usually able to outbid even the largest gunter clans and add it to their arsenal.Wade Watts, a lone gunter whose avatar is named Parzival, became obsessed with the Hunt on the day of Halliday's death, and, years later, devotes almost every minute of his life not spent sleeping or in school (like many, he attends school in the OASIS, and is now in the last year of high school) on the Hunt, reading and re-reading Anorak's Almanac, reading, listening to, playing, and viewing everything mentioned therein, to the extent he can recite the dialogue of the movies from memory. He makes copious notes in his \u201cgrail diary\u201d, named after the one kept by Indiana Jones. His friends, none of whom he has ever met in person, are all gunters who congregate on-line in virtual reality chat rooms such as that run by his best friend, Aech.Then, one day, bored to tears and daydreaming in Latin class, Parzival has a flash of insight. Putting together a message buried in the Almanac that he and many other gunters had discovered but failed to understand, with a bit of Latin and his encyclopedic knowledge of role playing games, he decodes the clue and, after a demanding test, finds himself in possession of the Copper Key. His name, alone, now appears at the top of the scoreboard, with 10,000 points. The path to the First Gate was now open.Discovery of the Copper Key was a sensation: suddenly Parzival, a humble level 10 gunter, is a worldwide celebrity (although his real identity remains unknown, as he refuses all media offers which would reveal or compromise it). Knowing that the key can be found re-energises other gunters, not to speak of IOI, and Parzival's footprints in the OASIS are scrupulously examined for clues to his achievement. (Finding a key and opening a gate does not render it unavailable to others. Those who subsequently pass the tests will receive their own copies of the key, although there is a point bonus for finding it first.)So begins an epic quest by Parzival and other gunters, contending with the evil minions of IOI, whose potential gain is so high and ethics so low that the risks may extend beyond the OASIS into the real world. For the reader, it is a nostalgic romp through every aspect of the popular culture of the 1980s: the formative era of personal computing and gaming. The level of detail is just staggering: this may be the geekiest nerdfest ever published. Heck, there's even a reference to an erstwhile Autodesk employee! The only goof I noted is a mention of the \u201cscreech of a 300-baud modem during the log-in sequence\u201d. Three hundred baud modems did not have the characteristic squawk and screech sync-up of faster modems which employ trellis coding. While there are a multitude of references to details which will make people who were there, then, smile, readers who were not immersed in the 1980s and/or less familiar with its cultural minuti\u00e6 can still enjoy the challenges, puzzles solved, intrigue, action, and epic virtual reality battles which make up the chronicle of the Hunt. The conclusion is particularly satisfying: there may be a bigger world than even the OASIS.",

                "reviewText": "Im Jahr 2045 verbringt ein Gro\u00dfteil der Menschheit seine Zeit in der virtuellen Welt der OASIS, alleine schon um der harten Realit\u00e4t einer zugrunde gehenden Welt zu entkommen. Allerdings bietet die OASIS nicht nur Unterhaltung in Form von Spielen und Filmen, sondern auch Arbeitspl\u00e4tze und Bildungsangebote. Wade Watts ist praktisch in der OASIS gro\u00df geworden. Vor einer Weile hat er dann auch die Gelegenheit genutzt und ist von seiner realen Schule in eine virtuelle Schule in der OASIS gewechselt. Neben der Schule verbringt Wade seine gesamte Zeit mit der Suche nach einem Easter Egg in der virtuellen Realit\u00e4t. Der OASIS-Erschaffer James Halliday ist f\u00fcnf Jahre zuvor verstorben und hat in seinem Testament verf\u00fcgt, dass sein gesamtes Verm\u00f6gen und seine Mehrheitsanteile an der OASIS an denjenigen Spieler gehen, der zuerst ein von ihm verstecktes Easter Egg aufsp\u00fcren kann. Anfangs war das Interesse an der Eierjagd riesengro\u00df. Doch nachdem jahrelang keine Spur gefunden werden konnte, haben die meisten Menschen das Interesse verloren. Lediglich die Firma IOI, die die OASIS \u00fcbernehmen und wirtschaftlich ausbeuten m\u00f6chte, besch\u00e4ftigt noch professionelle Spieler, die f\u00fcr sie das Easter Egg aufsp\u00fcren sollen.Wade hat sich inzwischen unglaublich viel Wissen \u00fcber James Halliday und dessen Lieblingsepoche, die 80er Jahre, angeeignet. Aber da er nicht \u00fcber das n\u00f6tige Geld verf\u00fcgt, um seinen virtuellen Avatar in der OASIS herumzuteleportieren, kann er sich nicht auf den unz\u00e4hligen Planeten umschauen, sondern sitzt jeden Tag auf den Schulplaneten Ludus fest. Doch dann kommt ihm eine unglaubliche Erkenntnis. Das erste R\u00e4tsel auf der Suche nach dem Easter Egg spricht vom Lernen und k\u00f6nnte sich somit auf genau diesen Schulplaneten beziehen. Wade l\u00e4sst eine Suchsoftware eine Karte des Planeten scannen und wird tats\u00e4chlich f\u00fcndig. Eine Nachbildung des ber\u00fcchtigten Tomb of Horrors aus einer alten Dungeons & Dragons-Erweiterung befindet sich auf einem Wald auf der anderen Seite des Planeten und somit in greifbarer N\u00e4he.Dank der im Netz zu findenden Spielanleitung kann sich Wade mit seinem schw\u00e4chlichen Avatar an allen Fallen vorbei bis ins Zentrum des Dungeons bewegen. Dort erwartet ihn jedoch eine \u00dcberraschung. Anstatt gegen einen untoten Zauberer k\u00e4mpfen zu m\u00fcssen, muss er diesen an einem alten Spielautomaten schlagen. Gl\u00fccklicherweise sind antike Videospiele genau Wades Steckenpferd. So gelingt es ihm knapp den Zauberer zu schlagen, der sich sogleich in eine Nachbildung von James Halliday verwandelt, die ihm gratuliert und einen Schl\u00fcssel \u00fcberreicht. Kaum ist der James Halliday wieder verschwunden, st\u00fcrmt Art3mis ins Grabmal. Die hochlevelige Spielerin ist im Netz bekannt und auch Wade geh\u00f6rt zu ihren Bewunderern. So bringt er erst einmal auch kein Wort raus, als Art3mis wissen will, was er hier zu suchen hat.2018 erschien ein Film von Regisseur Steven Spielberg basierend auf Ready Player One. Am Drehbuch schrieb Ernest Cline mit. Auch wenn vom Buch haupts\u00e4chlich einige Grundideen und die Charaktere \u00fcbernommen wurden, ist das Ergebnis extrem sehenswert. Buch und Film enthalten komplett unterschiedliche Aufgaben f\u00fcr die Easter Egg J\u00e4ger und viele neue Referenzen auf die 80er Jahre Popkultur. So wird das Vergn\u00fcgen verdoppelt, anstatt dass man sich \u00fcber eine halbherzige Filmadaption \u00e4rgern muss.",
