                "reviewText": "I haven\u2019t read the first part of this novella bond-up in a while, but I did recently (when I received this product) read the second part. I liked the short story, and it provided crucial information when bridging the gap between Defy Me and Imagine Me. Although, I\u2019m slightly confused because the end of the second novella doesn\u2019t line up with the first part of the first chapter (Tahereh Mafi released it on her Instagram) of Imagine Me. I\u2019m sure, in the end, it\u2019ll end up making sense. Anyways, I thoroughly enjoyed reading the content of this book/novella, and I\u2019m glad I was able to get my hands on it. Of course, I would enjoy anything written in Kenji\u2019s perspective. Anyways, overall, this was throughly enjoyable and quick to read, and if you are planning to skip over this and move from Defy Me to Imagine Me, the realize that you will miss lots of important details. Anyways, good luck reading!",
