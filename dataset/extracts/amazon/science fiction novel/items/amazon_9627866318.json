Plus his best for was here when I read it and he LOVED it too! I even found it to be very funny and I'm constantly telling my son his \"potty humor\" not really funny.Honestly, I would recommend this book for any age, child and adult.

Peter and Willy are typical boys and brothers. Each trying to outdo the other, and each wanting to place blame for everything that goes wrong on their little sister. Their combined farting capabilities reach to the moon and back. The unsung hero of the book is a hamster named Squeaky! I wish I would have had this book when my son was younger. He may have actually found a book that he would have read! The fart facts at the end are genius!",

But while encountering aliens from Uranus, their gift is an incredible asset. Maybe too much of an asset. Will they escape?I loved the second book in the Fantastic Flatulent Fart Brothers series! You don't have to read them in order, and I think this one is even better than the first. What could be better than farts in space? Annoying little sisters? And possibly my favorite characters, The Big Fat Pupu Face, Pipi Face and Pipi Pants. (And here I am laughing again!) I cannot recommend this book enough for kids drawn to potty humor with cartoon illustrations like Captain Underpants, Icky & Ricky, or Fart Squad: Fartasaurus Rex.",
