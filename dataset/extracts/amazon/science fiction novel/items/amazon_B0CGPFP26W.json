But I did like your light, tongue-in-cheek approach and I don\u2019t see often that - reminds me a bit of the Stainless Steel Rat series. Keep up the fun.My only complaint is a common one, but it happens. Please avoid multiple character names all starting with name letter. In book 1 you have Jessica, Jessup, several starting with \u201cJ\u201d. I am one of those minority readers who like to semi-skip read. I don\u2019t skip anything important but it helps speed things up in my mind if I don\u2019t need to read the character names repeatedly. Just spot the first letter then get on to the narrative. Using multiple \u201cJ\u201ds forces me to re-read some paragraphs to reorient the characters - oh, that was Jessup, not Jessica, etc. I don\u2019t think there is any underlying reason for multiple first-letter names so I suggest getting more variety.",

The fact that two competent officer's careers were terminated by speculative circumstances by dubious higher-ups is odd by itself. Add to that the many strange actions leading to a rather explosive ending leads to the conclusion that this is just a setup for a series.I wouldn't go so far as calling this a good read but it was okay but not quite Syfy.It also has a British flavor that that over achieving island nation is now running Earth's government and space programs that truly is fictional.Not all is lost. The main characters are entertaining and the writing if not the premise is good.It was good enough to try the next book before abandoning ship.",

This is the first book that I have read by Skyler Ramirez and can safely say it will not be my last and I can't wait to find out what happens to Captain Brad Mendoza and Lieutenant Commander Jessica Lin.

This is a quick-to-read story about a naval officer (space navy) in disgrace who is ordered to take command of 'The Worst Ship in the Fleet.' He is divorced, drunk, and on a downward spiral. But by dumb luck, he sorts out an encounter with more powerful hostile ships. I read this short fiction in a day, then ordered out the next in the series and read it too! If you want an enjoyable read, this is it.",

I was left with plenty of wants, though\u2026- I wanted to know the history of several of the characters.- I wanted more on one of the characters that played a small but vitally important part in the story.- I wanted more on the world building, because it seems quite interesting indeed!- I wanted\u2026. well, more of everything!Great story. I\u2019m happy the author decided to turn it into a series. Wish the books were longer, though!",
