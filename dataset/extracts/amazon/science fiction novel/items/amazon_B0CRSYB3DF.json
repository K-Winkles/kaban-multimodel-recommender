                "reviewText": "I like Ruby Dixon. I love the big blue alien boys, and her Drakoni nearly as much. That is why I'm giving this book a 5-star review after my fourth pass through the IPB and Icehome series. However, the caveat: this book deals with the topics of not only the loss of a child, but of adoption. I feel a warning is needed for adoption survivors in particular.(And if you don't know what an adoption survivor is, then this warning won't help you.)The loss of Gail's teenage son (about twelve years? prior, and certainly well before her abduction and consequent enslavement) is touched upon, but is not the central theme. It is mentioned as an old loss, an important loss--but a loss that Gail has survived. This may be a problem for readers who are still trying to cope with a similar loss of their own but it is not explored in painful detail.However, the adoption theme is what I feel a reader needs to know about in advance--and that because these stories ARE HEAs (happily ever afters) many of the sensitive real life subjects that appear in the series overall DO get sugar coated at various points. It wouldn't be much of an enjoyable fantasy world if they weren't, amirite?But as an adoption survivor, I feel this particular story needs the caveat that this may be the one book of the series that you want to skip. Not because the infant in question is an orphan. Not because he was neglected or abused while being \"fostered\" (because he was not--rather, far from it). Not because he was placed with unsuitable or wrongly-motivated adoptive parents (because in most ways, Gail and Vasa are seemingly perfect for this new role).But because the difficult, painful process of integrating/melding completely unrelated persons into a solid family unit is suddenly resolved in a slightly disturbing manner: Gail, who hasn't nursed a child in at least twenty-five years and is now menopausal, decides to give the fussy alien baby her breast to comfort him. And after a trip to the Healer, she's also suddenly able to fully lactate again--and the adoptive infant that did not accept her AT ALL is suddenly transformed into an adoring four-armed bundle of joy simply because he's now nursing. Nursing a female of a completely different species, mind--as if all the problems with dietary intolerances he was having are solved by trans-species breast milk.Look, I get it that this IS a novella. It IS a HEA fantasy series. But this subject (the \"adoption is a hell of a lot harder than this\" subject) is WAY too big for the casual treatment it received in this book. And if it cannot be revisited at a future point in an honest manner, then I feel this series was better off without it being introduced at all.Other books have had heroines with far less than ideal childhood experiences, so I know awareness is there--but the hard truth is that it isn't merely the \"foster care system\" that presents a danger to children--or to adoptive parents. Adoption is simply far too important and complicated of a subject to be brushed up against so casually--and I will never be in favor of perpetuating the \"if the adoption got approved, then everything must be fine\" myth.",

It\u2019s not like the previous books in that we get a full romance and resonates.Gail is over 50 who will not resonate and Vaza is an older alien. Gail and Vaza are clearly already in an adorably loving and stable relationship, something that has developed in the background of the other books. Both have found pleasure and a relationship that works, but both miss not having children of their own. They get a chance in this story to adopt.Z\u2019rhen is adorable and somewhat cranky. I enjoyed both Gail and Vaza\u2019s POV. Their relationship is nice and they make a family together.This was nice slice into the life of the Icehome series. If you enjoy sexy aliens then I recommend picking up Dixon novel.Rated: 3.5 Stars",

After several years of slavery, finding herself on an Ice Planet and the object of one man's interest has to have been baffling. Every woman wants to be genuinely desired and treasured and that's what Vaza gives her. Knowing that resonance isn't possible, this couple is delighted at the opportunity to be parents to an orphan.I have enjoyed all of the Ice Barbarian series, and am now reading Icehome.
