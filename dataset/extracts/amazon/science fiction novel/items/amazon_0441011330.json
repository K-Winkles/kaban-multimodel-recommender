                "reviewText": "This is a small collection of what Card finds to be some of the most influential sci fi across the ages (Golden, New Wave, Media Generation). The book, if you factor out the essays, is probably about 350 pages long, so a fairly quick read for a decent price.Most of the stories were amazing in some way, although there are a few that are so bad that it scratches my head that I can't imagine why Card would include them, such as Ellison's \"Repent, Harlequin!\" I suppose not all experimental stories are good ones. But then, how do you explain the inclusion of Niven's \"Inconstant Moon\"?As with all such anthologies, it comes down to your personal opinion. If you happen to like Card's work, you'll probably like a good number of the stories here, since the things a writer reads influences what they write. If you're going in blind and don't happen to like experimental fiction much, a lot of the New Wave stories will fall flat. The \"quality\" of experimental stories (that survive long enough to make it into anthologies) are often dependent on the temperament of the reader.The rest of the stories are amazing, though, and worth it.You'll just have to read for yourself.",

                "reviewText": "These twenty-seven science fiction stories are those Orson Scott Card found memorable, enjoyable and influential. Card stratifies his collection by three eras of twentieth century science fiction: The Golden Age (beginning of the century to the mid-1960s); The New Wave (mid-1960s to mid-1970s); and The Media Generation (mid-1970s and onward). Readers interested in the genre's history might consult Adam Roberts' History of Science Fiction for a definition of these eras--and pre-twentieth-century periods that Card omits from consideration.The Golden Age \"includes the writers and stories that created science fiction as we know it.\" Of Card's nine stories, two stand out. Poul Anderson's \"Call Me Joe\" explores the psychological connection between a biologically-engineered \"remote\" on Jupiter's surface and its human operator in orbit above. The still-current topic contrasts with a retro feel from \"tubes and circuits\" technology. Robert Heinlein's \"All You Zombies--\" guides us through the now-familiar scenario of a time-traveling police force that guards the timelines and recruits from various eras. The story's recruitment is undertaken with a close-knit cast of characters.New Wave stories are drawn from a period when science fiction was moving beyond the common story structures of the Golden Age. I have two favorites of Card's seven. Ursula Le Guin's \"The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas\" reminds us that we pay an almost-hidden price for our happy lives. After reading her story, we cannot claim to have no choice. Larry Niven's \"Inconstant Moon\" paces through the long, sleepless night after its protagonist figures out the puzzle of the evening sky's too-bright moon.Media Generation stories come from a less well-defined era, produced by writers who grew up watching science fiction movies and television shows. Here are the best two of Card's eleven. George Martin's \"Sandkings\" features a wealthy man who is self-centered, vain and cruel. And yet his alien pets worship him. Terry Bisson's \"Bear's Discover Fire\" explores the implications of a slight intelligence increase in a familiar mammal. It is understated, clever, and emotionally rich.The collection is highly recommended, both to experienced fans and to those needing an introduction to this century's science fiction. As Card admits, there are many good stories left out, many important authors not represented. Read for what is here. And enjoy.",

                "reviewText": "This collection of 27 stories, edited by Orson Scott Card, a science fiction writer of acclaim in his own right, is divided into three sections: \"The Golden Age\", \"The New Wave\", and \"The Media Generation\". Many of the giants of the genre are represented here. Mr Card provides a useful general inroduction to the volume and separate introductions for each story. Story selection is good, for the most part. I personally enjoy \"concept driven\" or \"character driven\", as opposed to \"technology driven\", Sci Fi and these stories fit that description. Some of the selections, especially in the first section, have been frequently anthologized and may be familiar to a well-read Sci Fi fan. However, many stories are not so well-known, especially in the two later sections. There is a fairly high proportion of \"gems\", worthy of multiple reads, in this volume. (To be fair, there are also a few duds, in my opinion.) Overall, for the money, a great buy.",

                "reviewText": "The book itself is well bound and printed, and contains a nice mix of stories, which I've listed below:Call Me Joe - Poul Anderson, \"All You Zombies\u2014\" - Robert A. Heinlein, Tunesmith - Lloyd Biggle Jr., A Saucer of Loneliness - Theodore Sturgeon, Robot Dreams - Isaac Asimov, Devolution - Edmond Hamilton, The Nine Billion Names of God - Arthur C. Clarke, A Work of Art - James Blish, Dark They Were, and Golden Eyed - Ray Bradbury, \"Repent, Harlequin!\" Said the Ticktockman - Harlan Ellison, Eurema's Dam - R.A. Lafferty, Passengers - Robert Silverberg, The Tunnel Under the World - Fredrik Pohl, Who Can Replace a Man? - Brian W. Aldiss, The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas - Ursula K. Le Guin, Inconstant Moon - Larry Niven, Sandkings - George R.R Martin, The Road Not Taken - Harry Turtledove, Dogfight - William Gibson & Michael Swanwick, Face Value - Karen Joy Fowler, Pots - C.J. Cherryh, Snow - John Crowley, Rat - James Patrick Kelly, Bears Discover Fire - Terry Bisson, A Clean Escape - John Kessel, Tourists - Lisa Goldstein, One - George Alec EffingerDevolution considers one possibility as to where life on Earth may have come from. The characters are well written and the plot is beautifully delivered.In The Nine Billion Names of God, Clarke imagines what might happen if a religious body decided to use computers in order to achieve its endgame.What if humans created robots to do their work for them, then disappeared? What would happen to the robots? Who Can Replace a Man? attempts to answer this question.Dogfight is classic Gibson: there's a sprawling, seedy metropolis, a highly-motivated main charcter, and plenty of emotional heft.Speaking of emotional helf: Bears Discover Fire and A Clean Escape are both passionate, engaging stories that hook the reader in nicely.I enjoyed some of the stories far more than others, but they all contribute to the collection, and I'm glad I read them. I'm not the biggest fan of Orson Scott Card, but his introduction sections\u2014both to the individual authors and book itself\u2014are worth reading too.",
