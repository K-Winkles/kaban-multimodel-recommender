I think that many readers will really enjoy it, but for me, there just wasn't enough character development and I just kept hoping to see that from Ruby but never did. I feel like the characters just always wanted to do something to change the whole mess, but it got to a point where it was unnecessary and it was almost as if they wanted to prove something that wasn't needed.The action in this book was beautifully written and the emotional drama was great.The book that, I would have to say, had me captured and wanted to read more, was the novella series/the last book in this series. I feel like the author had really gotten into the shoes of the different characters and really portrayed that matter. I felt attached to these characters and actually got to feel how they felt during the series that wasn't included then.",
