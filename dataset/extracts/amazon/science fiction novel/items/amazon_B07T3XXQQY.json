It would be nice if the protagonist was a decent human being instead of an arrogant jerk, too. I would like to see Murdock influence people by the power of reason instead of just giving them all the truth about the self-declared leaders by way of a nightmare. Far too little was done about how the third wave settled in and why so many died. Why Wasn\u2019t there another survival expert in each pod? And if we ever heard just what point the aliens had with this colonial program I didn\u2019t see it. I can only guess it was secretly a reality trivideo show titled THE GALAXY\u2019S MOSST INCOMPETENT COLONY.",

He wastes no time making himself unpopular with the new ones when he tells them where they are allowed to go and gives stern warnings about the dangers that they will now face. Some will heed his warnings and advice, but many will not. Two of the new arrivals happen to be his first wife\u2019s younger brother and sister. He brings them home with him. While they are happy to see their brother Declan, they manage to upset his wife. Em isn\u2019t the kind to take things lightly and the situation degenerates. The younger ones choose to leave and are returned to the newcomers. Old animosities surface with the Miners and they go after the medical facility. It\u2019s a fortress and impregnable. Kevin drives them all off and threatens to end their lives. One woman makes the mistake of taunting the leader of the losers and is killed. You gradually learn why Kevin was different from birth and just how many powers he has been granted through the Oomah, the bear/human-like creatures that actually control the planet and who is allowed where. You will not be given the explanation of how they acquired their abilities. This is a complex tale of complex people that plays out over the years. Kevin\u2019s wife is killed by the miners and revenge becomes a compelling force. One man decides he will somehow defy Kevin by making people believe that he caused his wife to commit suicide and blame the miners. This scenario will not play out in this part of their survival tale. The characters come to life as you see Irene Harris recover from her earlier trauma of several years ago. Kevin\u2019s oldest son will pass the qualifying test of the Oomah as all males must do to be accepted. Females do not as they are too important. Declan, howevr, decides to forgo his extra abilities rather than submit himself or his son to the test. Em decides that Kevin\u2019s new wife is not fit to be around her children and she and Declan depart with their children for one of the new arrivals colony. Will there be another story to reunite the family? The background is certainly there, but the author gives no hint that the questions raised will ever be resolved. You want to know because you care about the characters.",

                "reviewText": "Murdock and his tribe face the next influx of humans forced from Earth. These pods bring more humans than ever, and where new blood appears, trouble follows. The last settlers, still holding grudges against Murdock, move against him and his tribe, while trying to secure new blood for themselves. Meanwhile, those heeding his advice venture further afield, finding new dangers and terrors within this strange land. Each new pod brings with it new challenges, but this one was special, this one not only harboured humans, but the very enemy of the Oomah. Change is coming, and the bonds of loyalty will be tested to their limits, and beyond.I have followed this series from the beginning, and highly recommend book one as a starting place to give you a full appreciation for the depth and complexities of the story. The characters are diverse, interesting and well-conceived, and the plot has more than one surprise in store, as well as some revelations and explanations to really answer any questions raised from the previous books. As a reader you are drawn straight into the story, to the hardships and difficulties. You'll love, hate, and weep as you are integrated into the characters' lives. Action, chaos, vengeance, hope, judgement, survival, and love mesh to create a plot like no other, and one that, as always, leaves you wanting more.",
