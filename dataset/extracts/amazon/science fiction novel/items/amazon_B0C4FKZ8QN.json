                "reviewText": "Carter has been stuck in a time loop that ends with an explosion, literally. He\u2019s gone through it six times and knows exactly what will happen each time. This time, Carter decides to deviate, which causes him to accidentally bump into a gal called Mariana. And he realizes where she\u2019s going is near where the explosion will happen and he wonders if there\u2019s a connection.Mariana has been going through the motions ever since her stepsister Shay went missing(presumed dead) 3 months ago and is ready to resign from her job. She decided to give it four more days, especially when her group of scientists are invited to go see The Hawke Accelerator, the place where Shay wanted to work. Where she meets Carter who seems to know her and is trying to convince her she\u2019s in a time loop by putting her in the exact spot he was to help her remember. She remembers and now they have to work together to figure out how to get out of this time loop.That was a very long summary \ud83d\ude02 I love books that deal with time, and add romance to it, even better!I really enjoyed this book! It did have a little bit too much scientific jargon for me, but I really enjoyed the story and these two people just trying soooo hard to get out of this time loop. And then the adventures they go on just to take a break and live! The relationship they build over time and the romance is so sweet and also bittersweet. The way the story progresses, you\u2019re basically stuck in this time loop too just wondering if we will ever get out, and you think they got it, when suddenly the time loop starts over and there\u2019s just so many layers to get to the point that would solve it that I understand how Carter would feel down sometimes and want to give up.Carter Cho made me think of Remy from Ratatouille \ud83d\ude02 His love for food and how he\u2019s so offended by Mariana\u2019s reaction to food and how he teaches her to savor the moment, and enjoy it, sustenance versus like a shake, what flavors do you taste or smell, etc. He is seriously just so adorkable and endearing and I just loved Carter so so much!Mariana was more of the type A personality, but she also was going through grief after losing her closest friend and sister three months ago. She changed so much through this story. She allowed herself to live, to actually look at Carter differently especially after Shay always gave her a hard time of not giving guys a chance and being too picky for her own good, she started to savor moments like Carter, and I loved just seeing how her relationship with Carter changed.And that ending! I love bittersweet endings and this one was just perfect for me \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb Heartbreaking and yet a happy ending!If you enjoy books that involve time, and romance, then check this one out!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m a fan of Mike Chen\u2019s and this is the 5th book I\u2019ve read of his. I prefer his sci-fi books and usually end up loving those. This book\u2026 IS definitely one of those!In a near future, Carter and Mariana find themselves stuck in a four day time-loop where they are living the same four days over and over again. Think Groundhog\u2019s Day but with science. But there are major surprises along the way that make this story so unique and completely different from the classic GHD storyline.Carter and Mariana are the only ones who can remember what happened during each of the previous time loops so they work to try to figure out how to stop the loops, and fall in love with each other a little more each loop.Chen has done it once again by bringing in such amazing loving characters, you have to stay just to see how their story ends.And the food! If you\u2019re a foodie, read this book! If you love science, read this book. If you love futuristic science fiction, read this book. If you love time travel, read this book. If you love romance, read this book!I love futuristic Sci-Fi, science, and time travel. When the science goes over my head, yes, I glaze over, but I still love it!!This book was such a satisfying read for me and I\u2019ll be raving about it for some time!*Thanks so much to Mira Books and NetGalley for the gifted eGalley!*",

I loved when Carter and Mariana were working together, splurging on new cuisines, jetting cross continents, and plotting new paths forward, and I would have loved to see more of that storyline develop in a future Epilogue or bonus chapter(s).Synopsis:Mariana is a neuroscientist working at a startup that has discovered a way to relive the past by imprinting vivid memories into the brain\u2019s permanent record. Carter is a foodie with Michelin chef aspirations and a photographic memory. His day job: lab tech at a particle accelerator, where an inevitable accident is about to occur.When Carter and then Mariana get stuck in the cross-hairs, they find themselves stuck in an infinite time loop, cursed to repeat the 4 days leading up to the explosion that renders the entire facility a pile of rubble. As they try to figure out what went wrong and how to correct it, they will learn more about themselves and each other.Small gripe: the science aspects were confusing as can be the case with paradox of time loops. I found that if I thought too hard I had questions I couldn\u2019t resolve re: how it all worked.",
