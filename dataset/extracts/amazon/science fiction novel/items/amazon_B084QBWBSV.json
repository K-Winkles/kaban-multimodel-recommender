                "reviewText": "Book number five of a seven book series of science fiction novellas, short stories, and full length novels according to the publishing date. However, this is book number six of the seven book series according to series chronological date. I reread the well printed and well bound hardcover published by Tor in 2020 that I bought new from Amazon. I purchased the hardcover since it was cheaper than the trade paperback at the time. The series won the 2021 Hugo for the best series. I have all seven books in the series and am reading the seventh book now.Dr. Arada really wants Murderbot to stop calling hostile people \"Targets\". But, Dr. Arada is a terminal optimist. Murderbot is providing security for Dr. Arada's latest planetary survey when they are held up for food and ransom by a gang in a large boat on a water world. Dr. Thiego was attempting to negotiate with the Targets when the leader shot Murderbot. Murderbot seems to always be the first to get shot. And the last to get shot. As Murderbot resolves the situation, they launch their vessel from the ocean, and join the tractorship in orbit. They return to the Preservation system but are kidnapped almost as soon as they emerge from the wormhole by a unknown spaceship and are dragged back into the wormhole to an unknown system.Murderbot is a SecUnit, similar to a T-800 Terminator with a cloned and severely modified human brain. The brain is supplemented by the AIs in the cpu embedded in its head. There are lungs, there is a blood mixture with a synthetic, there is human skin over the entire body, there is a face, there is hair on the head and eyebrows. Everything else is machine. Somehow, the blood is enriched with electricity as there is no stomach or intestines. But, there are arteries and veins to keep the skin and brain alive. It has a energy gun in each arm and several cameras. The SecUnit can sustain severe damage to everything but the head and still survive.There is a personal MedSystem that continuously monitors the health of the SecUnit and gives constant updates to the SecUnit. And controls the clamps on the various arteries and veins throughout the torso and extremities of the SecUnit in case of damage. And shuts down the SecUnit in case of total system failure. Or reboots the SecUnit if needed.There is a personal SecSystem that has a threat awareness module that continuously updates the SecUnit on any and all threats it perceives. And monitors and controls up to thirty drones.There is a Governor that monitors what the SecUnit is doing versus the current orders (verbal or embedded) and punishes it using pain sensors in the human brain until it complies. And the governor will fry the brain of the SecUnit when if it leaves the vicinity of the controlling authority or the controlling authority leaves vicinity of the SecUnit.Murderbot is a self named SecUnit due to an unfortunate circumstance with 57 miners on a remote moon. It has hacked its governor and no longer allows the governor to give it orders or inflict pain. It prefers to internally watch its 35,000 hours of downloaded media such as episodes of \"The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon\" and \"WorldHoppers (aka Stargate)\". Even though it has a face, it does not like to interface with humans, yes, very introverted. It will follow human orders if it sees fit to do so.Murderbot is an incredibly interesting character. It handles horrible situations easily and personal interactions difficultly. Like I said, interesting.Quotes from the book:1. \"I am actually alone in my head, and that\u2019s where 90 plus percent of my problems are.\"2. \"Anyone who thinks machine intelligences don\u2019t have emotions needs to be in this very uncomfortable room right now.\"3. \"There is a lot about what is going on here that I don\u2019t understand. But I am participating anyway.\"Warning: There is violence and death in the books. Books one through four are a series of novellas, not regular length books. Book five is a regular length novel, book six is back to the novella, and book seven is a full length novel. You can buy a collection of the first four hardbacks at a nice discount.There is a free short story \"Home: Habitat, Range, Niche, Territory\" between books four and five.My rating: 6 out of 5 stars",

Murderbot is, like the rest of us, just trying to figure out life and get through each day albeit while dealing with more life and death situations than most of us. While the stories are set in interstellar space, we can all relate to the struggle of communicating and interacting with people, though Murderbot does it with more sarcasm and snark than the average human. Highly relatable characters and a great read!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars I LIKE IT",
                "reviewText": "This is the fifth entry in the Murderbot Diaries series. At 350 pages, it seems to be the only full-length novel in the series. The previous four were novellas, 172 pages or less, as is a subsequent book, Fugitive Telemetry (2021), which came out last year. Network Effect won the 2021 Nebula, Hugo, and Locus awards for best science fiction novel, and the Murderbot Diaries series won a Hugo in 2021 as best series. The only book in the series that I\u2019ve read is this one. I picked it up on the basis of an approving comment from a reviewer I respect \u2013Michael Dirda?- who praised the series\u2019 treatment of its alien protagonist.The protagonist is the narrator. Murderbot. It\u2019s a cyborg, an amalgam of human and manufactured parts, produced as a Security Unit, owned by a corporation or individual who bought it just as you might buy an inanimate object \u2013a lawnmower, for instance-- or just as slaveowners bought their slaves not all that far back in our history. The Unit\u2019s owner can order it to do anything the owner wishes as long as it doesn\u2019t conflict with a few basic pre-programmed prohibitions. Units aren\u2019t seen as persons. When not in use, they can be put to sleep. When damaged, they can be discarded, even have parts cannibalized to build a new Unit. This Unit, the narrator, has no personal identifier. When other characters in the narrative speak of it, it\u2019s \u201cit\u201d or \u201cSecUnit,\u201d which is what it was manufactured as, but not what it any longer is.In an earlier installment, SecUnit found a way to dismantle its governor module. Since then, it\u2019s been rogue, a free standing, self-directing entity, no longer a commodity or possession. As time goes on, the Unit has started to build relationships with people, a few, some humans and at least one fellow AI. It finds this new emotional baggage disturbing and inconvenient at times. Choices were simpler when it was just a tool, a super-efficient killing machine. The humans with whom he interacts find it puzzling too. Some trust it. Others see it as something like a pit bull \u2013it may not be threatening now, but you can\u2019t trust its reactions under stress\u2014and you don\u2019t know how it feels about humans for the simple reason it\u2019s not one.That\u2019s the backstory to Network Effect, which starts with the hostile takeover of the research vessel that Murderbot and several humans are traveling in. Their ship caught in the grip of a transport beam, and Murderbot and one of the humans, Amena, are drawn into an alien spaceship. The ship soon moves into a wormhole, which renders any prospect of outside rescue nugatory until the ship reenters normal space. Murderbot and Amena discover that the ship itself has been taken captive. They rescue two of the original crew members and Murderbot discovers that the ship was once controlled by his AI friend, a robot ship pilot (the ship was its body) named ART.The aliens have killed ART but ART left behind code that allows Murderbot to resuscitate him, minus memory of the time ART was out of commission. Murderbot discovers also that ART sicced the aliens on Murderbot\u2019s ship before it self-destructed itself because ART thought Murderbot could defeat the aliens and knew it could not. From there on, the plot takes off. The alien invaders are defeated. ART is restored to control of its vessel, which is awesomely powerful. The ship descends to the colony from which the aliens, infected descendants of the colony\u2019s original settlers, came to rescue ART\u2019s captured crew, who are being held hostage there. They\u2019re rescued, Murderbot is taken. ART goes to attack with all its awesome capabilities. Aided by another SecUnit whose governor unit Murderbot disables, and using a clever trick involving the creation of a second software version of its bot self, so that temporarily Murderbot can operate in two places at once, Murderbot escapes. The humans return home and Murderbot accepts an offer from ART to travel with it on its next mission.If you grew up like I did, cutting your eyeteeth on a steady diet of sci fi and fantasy, you realize, of course, that Network Effect is space opera, with all the fights and feints and whizbang flash that genre demands. But the science in Network Effect is less preposterous than, that in, say, the novels of E. E. \u201cDoc\u201d Smith, Edmond Hamilton or Jack Williamson and the characters are much better developed. Or perhaps I should say, Murderbot\u2019s character is. The humans in the story are pretty much window dressing and ART is as much a conceit as it is a person. But Murderbot is genuine. Reviewers have commented on it one of the more human and believable fleshings out of what a non-human being, forced to operate in a human world, might behave like and think (and feel too). Murderbot is also appealing, especially in those moments when it is trying to figure out how to live as ally and friend(?) with those perplexing and often irritating human beings who are around it.The human universe in which these characters move is heavily corporatized, a dog eat dog environment. Look high enough up the ladder, to Murderbot\u2019s former corporate owners for example, and it\u2019s Murderbot who emerges as the human one \u2013just not, you know, human.I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that though not great literature, this is good \u2013by which I mean interesting, even engrossing\u2014reading, and it appeals to us on two counts: our love of adventure (story-telling) and our curiosity about the different. It reminded me vaguely of Iain M. Banks\u2019s standalone novel of the future, Feersum Enjin (1994), one of whose narrators was a self-taught machine. Banks was a better writer and imaginer than Wells is, at least on the basis of this novel, but Wells is no slouch. But then, I have a high tolerance for what I once labeled \u201cjunk literature\u201d \u2013sci fi and fantasy, sea stories, spy thrillers, westerns and romance novels. Those were the books I used to cycle down to reality after long hours in grad school reading fifteenth-century chronicles in Spanish, French and Latin. Until I change my ways and convert to reading only the likes of Proust or Henry James, I guess I\u2019ll keep looking for the small pleasures of formula fiction when it\u2019s done well. As done here.",

Aunque el precio de los primeros 4 cuentos es alto considerando que no son novelas sino cuentos cortos, la verdad es que se disfrutan tanto que al final vale la pena el gasto. Creo que ser\u00edan mucho m\u00e1s atractivas para el p\u00fablico en general si sacaran un paquete de la serie completa a un precio m\u00e1s razonable.",
