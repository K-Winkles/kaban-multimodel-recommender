I loved how Alice, and the author, stayed true to Leonard with no miracles or tidy endings. It\u2019s a book that will stay with me - I read a lot so that\u2019s quite a compliment. And I am gifting it to my best friend and my sister who do not appreciate time-travel stories, but I think will appreciate this. Oh - and to my my daughter who turns 40 this year!",

                "reviewText": "This book was a companion while I'm waiting to get over being sick. I love time travel based stories and it had been in my list to read for a while. It was a cool take and I found myself getting attached to the protagonist (Alice). It was good enough to have a hard time putting it down. If you enjoy the idea of \"what if\" time travel I think you'll like this. If I had one critique, it would be that I wished the book was a little longer and got more into the results and consequences of Alice's decisions. I also found myself wondering a bit about that cat. I think there's some unspoken things going on there.",

                "reviewText": "When I read the publisher's brief synopsis of this novel, I immediately purchased the Kindle version because I am a fan of this genre. I thought it to be a novel twist on the time travel theme, and I did enjoy the book. However, I didn't love the book. These time travel novels tend to be very exciting and move quickly through the plot. That was not the case with \"This Time Tomorrow.\" I felt the plot dragged on in the last half of the story, and I don't believe that the story was well served by the protagonist's pity party attitude throughout the last half of the book. Nevertheless, I do recommend this book if you are a fan of the genre.",

Her \"obscure\" NY references were especially fun for me, for example she mentions the linen shop where I had a bedspread made! The overall premise of time travel is less appealing to me and I found that at times it was a little confusing and that it also got a little silly. I, personally wouldn't recommend it.",

The ability to time travel and do or undo things in hopes of making life for you or your loved ones better.

Having lost both of my parents, I would go back without question to those special moments that at the time I didn\u2019t realize how special they were. To see their smile, to see them young again, to see them living their life that I am now living as an adult. There is so much I took for granted. But isn\u2019t that what this book is about? To look back and appreciate what we had, but to learn from our past, know when to let go, and start looking forward to the future, whatever it is going to be?I have to end with this quote from the book: \u201cHappy endings were too much for some people, false and cheap, but hope\u2014hope was honest. Hope was good.\u201d After reading this book, I feel hope. Hope is good.",
