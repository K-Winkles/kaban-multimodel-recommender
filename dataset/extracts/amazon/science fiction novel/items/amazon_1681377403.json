            "Editorial Reviews Review \"Authoritarianism and resistance to it are twin threads that run through the dystopias of Social Fiction.... Montellier\u2019s drawings favor clean, symmetrical lines and a meticulous attention to detail....The dialogue is beautifully and idiomatically rendered in English by the poet Geoffrey Brock, who also contributes an introductory note and an interview with the author.\" \u2014Laila Lalami, The Nation\"Montellier is no prophet, but rather a feminist and an anti-fascist. Her dystopias of the \u201970s and early \u201880s address political, social and technological conditions which follow from patriarchy. Her alternate futures are real because they flow from our present, and her insights remain relevant and profound.\u201d \u2014Helen Chazan, The Comics Journal\u201cThere's anger in Social Fiction by Chantal Montellier but it's tinged with a wry sadness...which I think is best summed up by this quote: '...the betrayals of the 'leftist' government and the destruction of working-class communities upset and revolted me.'\" \u2014Clark Burscough, The Comics Journal \"The Best of 2023, As Decreed by Our Contributors\" \"I loved this. Montellier\u2019s shade of political disillusionment has a strikingly Ballardian sheen\u2014dilapidation preoccupied with the appearance of function\u2014with gorgeous cartooning. 'Dear Collaborators' might be the best one-page comic I\u2019ve ever read.\" \u2014Hagai Palevsky\u201cA pioneering woman in French comics [\u2026] Montellier, who is now 76, is not as flashy and action-oriented as her male counterparts of the era. What comes through in these stories is her dark humor, feminism, and still-relevant political allegories about government control over our lives. We\u2019re fortunate this work has finally been translated.\u201d \u2014Matt Bors, Bors Comics\u201cHauntingly farsighted satire\u2026, which still feels vibrant and at the same time prophetic.\u201d \u2014Emmet O\u2019Cuana and Kumar Sivasubramanian, Deconstructing Comics \u201cThis book collects together the 70s and 80s dystopian visions of the pioneering French feminist cartoonist Chantal Montellier in the form of three novellas. With its focus on the horrors of totalitarianism...it is gripping and sometimes darkly funny.\u201d \u2014Rachel Cooke, The Guardian \u201cRachel Cooke\u2019s Best Graphic Novels of 2023\u201d\u201cPublished together in English for the first time, this spiky collection of three science fiction graphic novellas from Montellier, one of the few women published in the famed French comics magazine M\u00e9tal Hurlant in its heyday, makes a case for her place as one of the publication\u2019s brightest creators. . . . Montellier\u2019s firm line and punk ethos recall the early, science fiction\u2013themed installments of Love and Rockets, but her vision is far bleaker, fueled by political rage, satirical wit, and a full-bore feminist drive. The anarchic sensibility feels both of its time and eerily prescient. It\u2019s a thrilling introduction to an unmissable comics talent.\u201d \u2014Publishers Weekly\"Montellier's 'dirty future' is not just dirty, it is barely functional. The dystopia in Social Fiction droops from the loosening tape that holds it together, yet people still comply. Like most M\u00e9tal hurlant contributors, Montellier lived through 1968, but unlike nearly all of them, she worked extensively in radical leftist venues prior to her narrative strip work; the sigh behind her pestilent societies is that of faded promise.\" \u2014Joe McCulloch, The Comics Journal\"The perils of totalitarianism take center stage in this collection of grimly humorous science-fiction novellas\u2026Montellier emerges as a true visionary of the graphic-novel medium and the science-fiction genre in these captivating tales of human beings struggling to retain their dignity under repressive regimes.\" \u2014Tom Batten, Library Journal About the Author Chantal Montellier is a French novelist, painter, and comics creator. Montellier began working as an editorial cartoonist in 1972, with work appearing in newspapers and magazines such as Politis, L'Humanit\u00e9, and Marianne. A contributor to the renowned comics magazine M\u00e9tal Hurlant and one of the most active female comics creators in France, Montellier is known for her realist drawing style and her engagement with political and feminist themes in her work. Geoffrey Brock is the author of two books of poetry, most recently Voices Bright Flags, and the translator of a number of books, including the NYRB Classics and NYR Children's Collection editions of Carlo Collodi\u2019s Pinnochio and the NYRC edition of The Tenderness of Stones."

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars English translation of 1970s and 1980s comics from 'Metal Hurlant'",
                "reviewText": "Those old enough to remember reading \u2018Heavy Metal\u2019 magazine in the late 1970s and early 1980s likely remember the comic \u20181996\u2019 by the French artist Chantal Montellier. \u20181996\u2019 depicted various goings-on in a dystopian, near-future New York City where life was anything but precious, and the ruling class indifferent to the sufferings of the less well-off. Montellier used a distinctive black-and-white, \u2018gritty\u2019 drawing style that contrasted with the more polished artwork then appearing in the magazine.Issued in July 2023, and coinciding with the unfortunate cancellation of \u2018Heavy Metal\u2019 magazine by its publisher Massive, \u2018Social Fiction\u2019 compiles English translations of all of the episodes of \u20181996\u2019, as well as two other comics that Montellier published in France in \u2018Metal Hurlant\u2019 in the early 1980s: \u2018Wonder City\u2019 and \u2018Shelter\u2019.One drawback to this trade paperback from New York Review Comics (an imprint of the New York Review of Books) is that at 7 x 9 inches it\u2019s considerably smaller than the dimensions of the magazines in which the comics originally were printed. As a result, the panels and their text have a cramped presentation that can make reading more laborious than I prefer. Too, the finer details of Montellier\u2019s draftsmanship, particularly in \u2018Shelter\u2019, tend to get lost in the downsizing.One area where this presentation gains favor, is in its elimination of the phonetic, mangled English translation that \u2018Heavy Metal\u2019 editors Sean Kelly and Valerie Marchant sometimes substituted for selected \u20181996\u2019 episodes (National Lampoon executives Matty Simmons and Leonard Mogel appointed Kelly and Marchant to helm 'Heavy Metal' because Kelly and Marchant spoke fluent French).Why Kelly and Marchant substituted the dialogue text is a mystery; they probably thought it was 'hip'. Well, with \u2018Social Fiction\u2019 you get a straight English translation, which makes understanding \u20181996\u2019 much, much easier.Who will like \u2018Social Fiction\u2019 ? Well, fans of the early years of \u2018Heavy Metal\u2019 once again will enjoy perusing the adventures of \u20181996\u2019 and the black humor that Montellier brought to her depictions of a near-future, dystopian New York City. \u2018Wonder City\u2019 and \u2018Shelter\u2019 also deliver cutting, satirical dissections of late 20th century society, from an unapologetically feminist perspective.As for younger readers, I\u2019m guessing indie comics hipsters may recognize \u2018Social Fiction\u2019 as a fine vehicle by which they can further their hipness. That\u2019s fine, as long as the hipsters recognize that the book is very \u2018French\u2019 in its attitudes\u2026\u2026\u2026",
