Each volume includes annotated texts, biographies of the authors, and additional scholarship. This outstanding boxed set includes:Volume I: 1953-1956The Space Merchants, by Frederik Polh ad C. M. Kornbluth: A dystopian satire of consumerism run amok, in which advertising is not only a profession but the de facto government.More Than Human, by Theodore Sturgeon: Imagines the evolution of a new species of humanity, Homo Gestalt, and how it gains the key to survival, a conscious.The Long Tomorrow, by Leigh Backett: Among the first meditations on the aftermath of nuclear holocaust, in which humans resort to primitive living, except for a handful of scientists in a mythical city.The Shrinking Man, by Richard Matheson: The novel that birthed the movie cult classic, in which a man shrinks down to walk among the most basic elements.Volume II: 1956-1958Double Star, by Robert A. Heinlein: Follows the exploits of a near do well thespian as he assumes the role of a lifetime that lasts a lifetime.The Stars My Destination, by Alfred Bester: About a man driven to the ends of the solar system, and ultimately beyond, by his thirst for revenge, loosely patterned after Dumas\u2019 The Count of Monte Christo.A Case of Conscious, by James Blish: In the future, a commission of humans confront the issue of morality without god on the planet Lithia, and the effect it would have on Earth society.Who?, by Algis Budry: A mash up of Cold War espionage, sci-fi, and alternative history that has a man questioning his very identity.The Big Time, by Fritz Leiber: As much a philosophical query into the nature of life, the effects of perpetual war, external life, love, and cynicism about pretty much everything, as it is about time travel and the disruption of the time line.Fans of science fiction will want to add this boxset to their collection.",

                "reviewText": "I would give this a 4.5/5 if I could, but I optimistically rounded it up to 5.This is a nice collection with some of the greats. Overall it's a decent representation of 50s sci-fi, though of course if I could pick my own it would have been different, however I would have kept The Stars my Destination in my personal list because it is one of the best books ever! Double Star is curious pick for Heinlein, there are other fantastic books they could have picked for Heinlein that would have been a better representation, but hey, at least they included him!One gripe I have is the slip case. It has a big nasty QR code on the top which is like an annoying blemish on an otherwise fairly attractive case. It's not a huge deal, just a small nag. Like all LoA volumes, the binding and materials are all very nice, so this collection should last as long as you do (and longer) provided you take good care of it!Keep an eye on the price! Volumes like this fluctuate in price quite drastically, one month it might be ~$38 and the next it might be $70! If you're patient then you can grab it for a nice little discount off of the normal asking price.",

                "reviewText": "I received this collection today as promised, having ordered it when the first announcement was made some months ago. I have not read the novels again but wish to comment on the presentation. The books are produced to the same standard as other LoA books, with clean typography, high-quality paper and Brillianta cloth binding. The end notes explain the sources of the texts (for example the multiple versions of Alfred Bester's The Stars my Destination, originally published as Tiger, Tiger) and define many names and places that might be unfamiliar. There also is a web site with essays on the novels and other information (loa.org/sciencefiction).In my opinion the nine novels are all among the best science fiction novels of the 1950s. There are some favorite authors missing, including Kurt Vonnegut, who has his own set of Library of America volumes, and Ray Bradbury, who may someday also have his own volume. But the selections are excellent and the presentation fine.Plus, to buy the least expensive mass market paperbacks of the nine would cost significantly more than the price of these volumes.",

The novels, originally published between 1953 and 1958, are surely among the favorites of experienced sf fans and readers, so for younger, less experienced sf readers this collection consists of key sf writers of the post-WWII era. Most of the selected novel titles have been considered ground-breaking, original in a time when sf was emerging from the pulp magazines to find a permanent home the publishing industry. The two book, boxed collection reflects the care taken in publishing works in The Library of America series. Notes and publishing history are sparse but informative. This nine novel set is now a permanent part of my sf library.",

                "reviewText": "The Library of America has done it again! I wasn't old enough to be reading these in the 1950s when they were published, but I did come along in the 60s and discovered science fiction by finding a stash of old pulp magazines. It was instant love with a specific type of story.As science fiction changed over the years, some of the directions taken were great and made wonderful reading, other directions were not quite as enjoyable to me, but I always missed the way it started. This compilation of novels is absolutely wonderful. It's like being taken back to the early years of science fiction writing.For the younger readers of science fiction, that have not had the opportunity to experience this style of writing, I highly encourage your buying this set and enjoying it. You will fall in love with a totally different style, and one that set the bar for future writers.Great reading.",
