Alma is a shy empath who has lost her fiance and is unable to cope in crowds. She moves to a small island off of Maine to small town where she has some family. Her story starts in 2026 and tells about the impact the rising sea is having on coastal areas. There is also a magical/supernatural element related to strange radio messages centered on an old relay tower above the town. When three town residents and her dog die on a strange day, only she can see and remember them. She spends the next ten years learning and telling their stories as the town is slowly destroyed by the encroaching sea.",

I am not sure I ever did understand it.Alma Hughes has a gift or a curse, depending on how you look at it. She can feel the feelings of others. However, it is overwhelming and she searches for places to be alone. In the past, she had met a boy who understood her and kept in touch with him via short wave radio for many years. They eventually got together; but on a hike in the mountains, he disappeared and she was lost for days. When she was rescued, she connected with a stray dog and took him as her own. She and Jupiter were to remain together.She wanted to get away and took a chance on going to a remote island in the North Atlantic where her aunt and uncle lived in a small village. The land is changing as the rising waters and fierce storms ravaged the area. Whole islands and towns disappeared as the earth began to die. The villagers were not willing to give up and were isolated on their island. However, there is something strange about the island. The villagers could hear voices coming through their appliances, walls, etc. The voices were coming from short wave radios from the present, past, and future. Could she find Alex in the Echoes or would she only find heartbreak again?",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m a fast reader, but this book was a slog. There were parts that made me wonder where the story was eventually going, but there were also parts that were written so beautifully and rang true to me.It\u2019s never explained why Alma got to stand between the living and the dead in the small town of Violette. The rational part of my brain really needs an explanation. The scientific discourse about sound waves started nicely, but fell flat in the end. There is this impossible brightness, and then the sound (which is dissected through several experiments), like the event in which the Echoes died. Like the one in which Alma\u2019s fiancee disappeared. Like lightning and the sudden shocking occurrences in life. I get the idea, but the nuances aren\u2019t tied together in the book.On the other hand, the creative part of my brain understands that we are all both real (alive/palpable) and unreal (dead/a reverberation of a thought) depending on who perceives us. I am real to my family, an echo to the rest of the world.The book is full of stories within stories, flashbacks within flashbacks. There were parts where I no longer cared about the details of a character\u2019s story, and after mulling it over, I decided it was the way these stories were arranged\u2026 or not arranged. Another reviewer used the word \u201cdisjointed\u201d. I agree. When it got to the part where I was supposed to know why Alma ran away from her old life, I was so tired from peeling story after little story that I just read the first sentence of every paragraph \u2014 and I think that was supposed to be the most important part, the motivation and impetus that started everything.I don\u2019t feel that there was anything maliciously political on the author\u2019s part in putting the story in a dystopian setting. Alma, as one of the Echoes noticed, had magic. And this magic shines in that setting. It is a dull shine, however. Alma\u2019s ardent desire for solitude kept her from growing this magic. It would have been a better read, to watch Alma come into her own in the prime of her life and have that juxtaposition between science and magic, the ending of the world and the mysticism of what\u2019s left behind. Instead, Alma only gets old and eventually gets found and taken away from the place she escaped into. She spent her life running and hiding, and it seems to me that was not the point of the novel.",

                "reviewText": "This is a gorgeous, sad, moving, hopeful book about the things that really matter.From what I can tell by reading reviews, with the exception of a few people who just don't like books that are more slidey or heavy or \"weird\", most of the people who don't like this book largely don't like it because they either truly do not believe humans are the cause of catastrophic and accelerating climate change, or because they know in their hearts that this is true but can't bear looking directly at it.So if you don't like books that aren't completely literal, plot driven, or fluffy, sure, skip it for that reason, I guess. Otherwise, you know yourself well enough to know what you believe is true, and how well you can tolerate dwelling in the complexity and enormity of truth.",

                "reviewText": "The premise is intriguing, and the writing is polished. When considering this book, the characters seemed engaging and I read with the interest until the story became darker and more disjointed. In the end, I felt as though I had been duped into reading a very negative polemic on climate change wrapped in the guise of a story with magical elements. Alma, the primary focus of the book, is emotionally broken and retreats to an island where she has relatives. I was lulled into thinking that the environment would provide some healing and Alma's experiences would help her mature and work through her grief. Instead, Alma becomes increasingly selfish and self-focused under the guise of needing \"space\" and becoming the mouthpiece for the Echoes (a few dead people and an animal that only Alma can see). Alma's life on the island ends sometime in the distant future in a dystopian world where there seems to be no hope. Other readers have commented on the themes of loneliness and environmental disasters, but these topics were presented from a decidedly fatalistic view.",

At times I found the plot hard to follow, not grasping whether a persona was alive or in the echo realm, but it all tied up in the end.",

If you like the prologue, you will love it. It has an absolute ripper of an opening paragraph, which is exactly how far *I* read to decide I wanted to buy it: \u201cEsm\u00e9e Taylor was making a sandwich when the teakettle told her the ship was going down. Moments later, she was tying her boots, and it was still talking to her from the stove top, broadcasting a distress call that no one else from town would hear. They were all dancing anyway.\u201dBut perhaps don\u2019t read it at work like I did.

This really is a beautiful story which is hard to pinpoint to a specific category.We follow the life of Alma who moves to an island after the disappearance and probable death of the fianc\u00e9 she loves. She is haunted by her loss and seeks solace in the nature and people she finds around the island Violette, which she now calls home.Whilst there, we learn that for many years, the people who live there claim to have heard echoes and messages sent from the imposing radio tower through their own home appliances. Messages that foretell of disaster and whispers from those who have been lost.This is a piece of special writing, in so many levels. The natural impact of global warming is described carefully and without lecture over a number of decades. The most impactful part of this tale for me, is the emotional and beautiful description of love and loss. How those of us who have lost someone we love so deeply, will strive to keep hold of them, their essence and their scent, for as long as we possibly can.I have never read a book that encompasses the yearning after loss that follows you at every point, at every day before. That is to say, this is not a depressing read; it\u2019s really beautiful and I couldn\u2019t stop reading. Alma, works hard to help those she cares for, even when that means her own happiness is affected.Add this to your tbr, you won\u2019t regret it \ud83d\udc2cThanks to Amazon Kindle for this pre-release book on kindle \ud83e\udd70 part of Amazon First Reads\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",
