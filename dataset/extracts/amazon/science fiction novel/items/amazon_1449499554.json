Now that he is required to read chapter books, I was dreading trying to find anything he would be excited to read. He enjoys videogames so I took a chance...He LOVES these books. It is the first time in his life that he comes to us asking if he can read to us so he can find out what is going to happen next. We're on book three, but I had to write this review because I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase. Book three gets really intense and I find myself guessing with him how they're going to get out of certain situations. THANK YOU DUSTIN BRADY! You've lit a spark for reading that I thought I would never see in my son.",

It also kept me engrossed for hours and for that period of time I just didn't want to read anyother book . I would recommend this to anyone because this book is absolutely amazing. This book can really clear your mind so it is not the best book if you want to keep your mind full of information but it is still absolutely amazing nonetheless. So I really hope this review inspires you to read the book and please review it yourselves.",
