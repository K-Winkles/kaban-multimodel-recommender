                "reviewText": "So, I don't delve into the classics too often. But I had a book that's an adaptation of this one and decided before reading it, that I should understand the original. I do have to say, this was a strange book. While it falls prey to the issues of its time (references to race, etc) I do think that it aged well in terms of the actual plot.After a shipwreck, Edward Prendick is luckily (or not so luckily) rescued by another boat that happens to be carrying a menagerie and a strange fellow who is able to nurse him back to health. His luck takes another turn when they are dropped on an island, and he is forced to stay there, only to discover another man with an unusual hobby involving said menagerie.I know there have been a couple of movie adaptations on this, and it makes me wonder what the characters are like in them because truthfully, they're not very descriptive or detailed in this book. We have their reactions to things, but really not a lot else (unless you consider the character trait of drunkenness for the assistant). Even our main character, Prendick, is known only through his recounting of the experience, although he does have some opinions about the morality of what he sees.The book is fast paced and violent. Not to spoil too much, but there is some torture and gristly scenes described in this book. It was actually more detailed than I expected. And while some of it just doesn't make sense to me from a scientific standpoint, it's still well described and interesting. With the premise and morality of Moreau's work more of the main point than the actual 'how it is done.'I thought the book interesting, but am looking forward to the adaptation more. I can only hope for more nuanced characters while still having the creepy vibe.Review by M. Reynard 2022",

                "reviewText": "I remember an old movie that starred Burt Lancaster... considered too intense for kids my age, but the general gist was a \"mad scientist\" who created cross-breeds between humans and other species. Here is the original by H.G. Wells. Published in 1896, it holds up well for the 21st- century reader. I suppose Stephen King might deliver something with more in-your-face shock value, but Wells gets the picture across despite his Victorian constraints. It's a quick read; the storyline makes sense, and the epilogue leaves us with \"big thinks\" to ponder for our present age. Such as, how powerful is the civilizing force of our \"evolved humanity?\" How close beneath the surface lurks our ungovernable savage nature? And how are we to respond when it breaks free of its fetters?",
