JOHN MANDEL's five previous novels include The Glass Hotel and Station Eleven, which was a finalist for a National Book Award and the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction and has been translated into thirty-five languages. She lives in New York City. Excerpt. \u00a9 Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Jeevan\u2019s understanding of disaster preparedness was based entirely on action movies, but on the other hand, he\u2019d seen a lot of action movies. He started with water, filled one of the oversized shopping carts with as many cases and bottles as he could fit. There was a moment of doubt on the way to the cash registers, straining against the weight of the cart\u2014was he overreacting?\u2014but there was a certain momentum now, too late to turn back. The clerk raised an eyebrow but said nothing. \u201cI\u2019m parked just outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll bring the cart back.\u201d The clerk nodded, tired. She was young, early twenties probably, with dark bangs that she kept pushing out of her eyes. He forced the impossibly heavy cart outside and half-pushed, half-skidded through the snow at the exit. There was a long ramp down into a small park-like arrangement of benches and planters. The cart gained speed on the incline, bogged down in deep snow at the bottom of the ramp and slid sideways into a planter. It was eleven twenty. The supermarket closed in forty minutes. He was imagining how long it would take to bring the cart up to Frank\u2019s apartment, to unload it, the time required for tedious explanations and reassurances of sanity before he could return to the grocery store for more supplies. Could there be any harm in leaving the cart here for the moment? There was no one on the street. He called Hua on his way back into the store. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now?\u201d He moved quickly through the store while Hua spoke. Another case of water\u2014Jeevan was under the impression that one can never have too much\u2014and then cans and cans of food, all the tuna and beans and soup on the shelf, pasta, anything that looked like it might last a while. The hospital was full of flu patients and the situation was identical at the other hospitals in the city. The ambulance service was overwhelmed. Thirty-seven patients had died now, including every patient who\u2019d been on the Moscow flight and two E.R. nurses who\u2019d been on duty when the first patients came in. The shopping cart was almost unmanageably heavy. Hua said he\u2019d called his wife and told her to take the kids and leave the city tonight, but not by airplane. Jeevan was standing by the cash register again, the clerk scanning his cans and packages. The part of the evening that had transpired in the Elgin Theatre seemed like possibly a different lifetime. The clerk was moving very slowly. Jeevan passed her a credit card and she scrutinized it as though she hadn\u2019t just seen it five or ten minutes ago. \u201cTake Laura and your brother,\u201d Hua said, \u201cand leave the city tonight.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t leave the city tonight, not with my brother. I can\u2019t rent a wheelchair van at this hour.\u201d In response there was only a muffled sound. Hua was coughing. \u201cAre you sick?\u201d Jeevan was pushing the cart toward the door. \u201cGoodnight, Jeevan.\u201d Hua disconnected and Jeevan was alone in the snow. He felt possessed. The next cart was all toilet paper. The cart after that was more canned goods, also frozen meat and aspirin, garbage bags, bleach, duct tape. \u201cI work for a charity,\u201d he said to the girl behind the cash register, his third or fourth time through, but she wasn\u2019t paying much attention to him. She kept glancing up at the small television above the film development counter, ringing his items through on autopilot. Jeevan called Laura on his sixth trip through the store, but his call went to voicemail. \u201cLaura,\u201d he began. \u201cLaura.\u201d He thought it better to speak to her directly and it was already almost eleven fifty, there wasn\u2019t time for this. Filling the cart with more food, moving quickly through this bread-and-flower-scented world, this almost-gone place, thinking of Frank in his 22nd floor apartment, high up in the snowstorm with his insomnia and his book project, his day-old New York Times and his Beethoven. Jeevan wanted desperately to reach him. He decided to call Laura later, changed his mind and called the home line while he was standing by the checkout counter, mostly because he didn\u2019t want to make eye contact with the clerk. \u201cJeevan, where are you?\u201d She sounded slightly accusatory. He handed over his credit card. \u201cAre you watching the news?\u201d \u201cShould I be?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a flu epidemic, Laura. It\u2019s serious.\u201d\u201cThat thing in Russia or wherever? I knew about that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s here now. It\u2019s worse than we\u2019d thought. I\u2019ve just been talking to Hua. You have to leave the city.\u201d He glanced up in time to see the look the checkout girl gave him. \u201cHave to? What? Where are you, Jeevan?\u201d He was signing his name on the slip, struggling with the cart toward the exit, where the order of the store ended and the frenzy of the storm began. It was difficult to steer the cart with one hand. There were already five carts parked haphazardly between benches and planters, dusted now with snow. \u201cJust turn on the news, Laura.\u201d\u201cYou know I don\u2019t like to watch the news before bed. Are you having an anxiety attack?\u201d\u201cWhat? No. I\u2019m going to my brother\u2019s place to make sure he\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he be?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not even listening. You never listen to me.\u201d Jeevan knew this was probably a petty thing to say in the face of a probable flu pandemic, but couldn\u2019t resist. He plowed the cart into the others and dashed back into the store. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you left me at the theatre,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just left me at the theatre performing CPR on a dead actor.\u201d\u201cJeevan, tell me where you are.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in a grocery store.\u201d It was eleven fifty-five. This last cart was all grace items: vegetables, fruit, bags of oranges and lemons, tea, coffee, crackers, salt, preserved cakes. \u201cLook, Laura, I don\u2019t want to argue. This flu\u2019s serious, and it\u2019s fast.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s fast?\u201d\u201cThis flu, Laura. It\u2019s really fast. Hua told me. It\u2019s spreading so quickly. I think you should get out of the city.\u201d At the last moment, he added a bouquet of daffodils. Read more"

                "reviewText": "Station ElevenEmily St. John MandelImagine a world where the libraries and bookstores are closed. No theatres, concerts or films. Singing and laughing together can be deadly. Wait\u2026 we don\u2019t need to imagine it. We\u2019re living in this world now. There are so many parallels between the world of Station Eleven, and the present day Covid 19 pandemic, except the pandemic in the novel spreads even faster and is inevitably fatal. Victims die within two days of getting sick. So, it could be worse. This fictional pandemic manages to wipe out 99.9% of Earth\u2019s population, more or less. There\u2019s no way to be sure of the statistics because there\u2019s no internet, or gas, or electricity. Small bands of survivors find each other, and sometimes form settlements, sometimes murder each other. The people who are interested in rebuilding a nonviolent civilization sometimes need to kill in self-defense, in attempts to save their friends or themselves, and their vision of a better, peaceful, productive life.The story begins before most people are aware of this deadly virus. Jeevan, a former paparazzi photographer, and paramedic in training, receives a phone call from a friend, warning him to stock up on groceries, and hide away in quarantine. He listens to his friend\u2019s advice, and tries to warn his girlfriend, who replies, \u201cIt\u2019ll be like SARS\u2026They made such a big deal about it, then it blew over so fast.\u201d Sound familiar? Seems to me that I heard someone say, \u201cWhen the warm weather arrives, the Corona Virus will just disappear.\u201d It hasn\u2019t yet; after seven months we still have no vaccine and people are still dying. It\u2019s August, it\u2019s been warm for more than two months now, and the virus is still going strong.The story, like everyone\u2019s life, is divided into chapters that take place before and after the pandemic. Kirsten, a young actress who was eight years old when the virus struck doesn\u2019t remember much about her early life. After the pandemic, as an adult, she\u2019s part of a traveling Shakespearean theatre troupe. They travel from \u201ctown\u201d to \u201ctown\u201d with a small orchestra, giving performances and concerts. \u201cBecause survival is insufficient.\u201d \u2013 a quote from Star Trek that\u2019s repeated throughout the novel, and is painted on the side of the players\u2019 horse-drawn van. It\u2019s their motto, their words to live by. Shakespeare\u2019s life and career were also defined by and shaped by the plague. The Globe Theatre was often closed due to the disease. \u201cPlague closed the theaters again and again, death flickering over the landscape.\u201d Shakespeare lost people he loved and understood how death can strike fast, hot and sharp like a bolt of lightning. \u201cHell is the absence of the people you long for.\u201d Tell me about it. I haven\u2019t seen one of my daughters for a full year, but at least she\u2019s still alive, and there\u2019s a strong possibility we\u2019ll be able to spend time together soon. I\u2019ve visited my ninety-year-old father once in seven months, just last week. Yesterday, his assisted living facility went back into lockdown. The CEO tested positive for Covid. Again, and again, the characters of Station Eleven, their lives, thoughts, and dialogue resonate with me.Along with the lives of Kirsten and Javeen, another common thread holds the narrative together: a science fiction graphic novel, titled Station Eleven, created by Miranda, an artist. The fictional Dr. Eleven has also survived an apocalypse. He lives on a spaceship called Station Eleven, that\u2019s disguised as an island, and says, \u201cI stood looking over my damaged home and tried to forget the sweetness of life on Earth.\u201d Kirsten, one of the main characters has forgotten, defensively blocked out, a memory of her life on the road when she was still a child. She also has difficulty remembering happier times. Kirsten has the only known copy of Station Eleven and its sequel, The Pursuit. She has memorized all of the text. \u201cWe long only to go home\u2026We have been lost for so long\u2026We long only for the world we were born into.\u201d At one point in the story, these words buy her time and save her life.Groups of people have banded together and formed townships. One of them has a school, a library and a museum. There\u2019s a debate about whether or not the school children should learn about history, the way civilization was before they were born. Do they need to picture what life was like when you could connect to other humans across vast distances via cellphones and computers, to travel in cars, and even airplanes?In their quest to reach this unusually evolved civilization, the Shakespearean theatre troupe and orchestra meet a vicious, homicidal Doomsday cult with a prophet who spouts such horrific nonsense that no one can logically argue with him.\u201cThey tell you they were saved (from the plague) because they\u2019re superior people and free from sin\u2026You just remember your own lost family and either cry or harbor murderous thoughts.\u201dThis prophet actually carries with him a page torn from a copy of Station Eleven.There is so much to admire and enjoy in this novel. It asks a question that most of us are asking ourselves now: Can we rebuild civilization the way we knew it, only even better?In most ways, this fictional pandemic and its aftermath are so much more horrific than our present-day pandemic, but in some ways this fictional world is more beautiful. The strength and heroism of the best of the survivors is inspiring to witness.I loved this book, and won\u2019t stop thinking about it for a long time. I\u2019ve recommended it to all of my friends who read books and like to discuss them, a pastime I\u2019m very fond of, even more-so during this difficult time. \u201cBecause survival is insufficient.\u201d",

                "reviewText": "What if our Covid pandemic had been 99% fatal? This 2015 near future, low tech, on-earth sci-fi novel is clever, unnerving, imaginative and plausible. The key characters intersect on a PTSD-creating stage; sharing the public death of an infamous Hollywood actor while the first pandemic deaths flame through the City. From this beautifully written big bang, the individual character arcs vector into past and present scenes, and tangle through the early years of survival. A band of musicians and actors form The Traveling Symphony, playing classical music and performing Shakespeare among the small settlements around the upper Great Lakes. Mandel spends a lot of time on too many unimportant characters, for example the famous actor Arthur, and his wives. Taking the T-Sym plot further into work of survival and slow starts at rebuilding would have been much more interesting.",

                "reviewText": "Ms Mandel has an excellent publicist. She's gotten this book identified as some work of literature. They're making it prescribed reading in college, and bragging it up everywhere. It is definitely expensive, far more than all these Indie wannabes I read. The editing isn't much better. \"It was me\" \"aren't I\" \"who did I give it to\" not to mention some other pet peeves of mine. The story seems to have a point, but I don't get the epigraph. I can't figure the \"Too much, too much\" thing. As a general principle, I hate apocalyptic novels. I did enjoy Earth Abides. In that story, the plague wiped out so many people there weren't enough people to get a group of three hundred together. I'm not much for King's The Stand, which turned surreal in the middle. I don't mind a little morality thrown in, but let's cover it in detail. I'm not sure that morality was the purpose of this book. Father more concerned about his popularity than developing relationships with his son or his mother or his parade of wives? The failure to be involved with his family being the cause for the prophet? I am the light? What is that supposed to mean? Does the child show us the way by shooting the light? Or are we condemned to darkness? That comic book composed of ten copies, but we only see four printings with a missing edition, and some duplication in that two go to Katrina, and two to the son. Somehow it is central to the story, but some on station nine reside in the light while the others are pulled down to the darkness by seahorses. Nobody can go home because Dr. Eleven is in control, and says no. Since Miranda is Dr. Eleven, what does she have to do with anything? She goes out to the beach in Malaysia, and stares at container ships for the rest of her life. Are we hoping for container ships to rescue the world? I was upset that a pilot, one who could help the reconstruction, decides to make a futile flight with about 30 Asians when there was a need for a strength in numbers for defense and reconstruction. That's really what I don't like about apocalyptic stories. People are doing stupid or incorrect things, and the situation only gets worse. I cried when the old man selected the wrong leader in Earth Abides. It's been a long time, but Heinlein wrote a story about surviving a plague. Unlike this book, Heinlein's book was concrete in its story of survival. This book seems to think there is more than survival. Somehow society needs a band of actors and musicians to travel like gypsies to brighten the day. Reminds one of the medieval days. Anyway, I wonder if anyone consulted Maslow about this concept? It must be nice to sit at the top of our pyramid, and contemplate how the world should change as people are forced to grub around for everything they need.",

                "reviewText": "The book DID end up being every bit as masterful as the HBO series based on it, which I absolutely, immediately adored, and I look forward very much to reading Sea of Tranquility next. Emily St. John-Mandel's mind, her narration, her attitude, her ability to empathize in writing and convey emotions the rest of us have difficulty describing, and what's more, to attribute them to the sorts of nuances too subtle for some of us to perceive without her help. Clearly the work of a beautiful mind that has been allowed to idle creatively and introspectively. I hadn't received a literary spark like this since I first read Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.I stumbled across the show on HBO. From the very first few minutes I could tell this was the work of a BRILLIANT writer, and immediately wondered if the book was the reason for this, or if the screenwriters were simply very gifted, so decided to give the book a gander and see for myself. As evidenced in the overall quality of the concept, my guess was right on, and this was immediately one of the most engaging writers I had read in possibly an entire generation, at least insofar as novels go. Emily St.John-Mandel says what she has to say FEARLESSLY, with conviction, and without mincing words. I would be very curious to see how many drafts she wrote, as I wouldn't expect their to be many, with the writing coming at you raw, like, DARE I EVEN SAY? HEMMINGWAY?! Her mind is keen, and she knows exactly how many words she needs to bring you into her next thought, and somehow skips along her discontinuous narrative without losing you, at a rate that would set off alarms for other writers like the wheels were going to come off. A dancer no less, to be sure, in real life. Really? Fitting the way her prose dances across the page, from her mind into yours, without undue modesty. Clearly she wants to connect her thoughts to yours, and she chooses her words appropriately to that purpose. BRAVO! Now THIS is what SEXY writing looks like, and scratches the sci-fi/post-apoc itch no less!",

Die Autorin, Emily St. John Mandel, schafft es meisterhaft, eine postapokalyptische Welt zu entwerfen, die gleichzeitig d\u00fcster und hoffnungsvoll ist.Die Geschichte folgt verschiedenen Charakteren, die auf beeindruckende Weise miteinander verbunden sind. Mandel wechselt geschickt zwischen verschiedenen Zeitebenen, was dem Roman eine faszinierende Struktur verleiht. Die \u00dcberlebenden einer t\u00f6dlichen Grippe-Epidemie versuchen, in einer Welt ohne Elektrizit\u00e4t und moderne Technologie zu \u00fcberleben.Die Charakterentwicklung ist bemerkenswert, und man kann sich leicht mit den unterschiedlichen Figuren identifizieren. Mandels Sprache ist poetisch und einf\u00fchlsam, was die Atmosph\u00e4re des Buches noch intensiver macht.\"Station Eleven\" regt nicht nur zum Nachdenken \u00fcber die Fragilit\u00e4t unserer Zivilisation an, sondern auch \u00fcber die Bedeutung von Kunst und Kultur in einer Welt, die dem Untergang geweiht zu sein scheint. Die Beschreibungen der verlassenen St\u00e4dte und die Suche nach menschlicher Verbindung verleihen dem Buch eine tiefgreifende emotionale Dimension.Insgesamt ist \"Station Eleven\" ein literarisches Meisterwerk, das die Leser mit einer packenden Handlung und anspruchsvollen Themen begeistern wird. Ich kann es nur w\u00e4rmstens empfehlen, besonders f\u00fcr diejenigen, die nach einem Buch suchen, das sowohl intellektuell anregend als auch emotional ber\u00fchrend ist.\"Station Eleven\" is a captivating book that held me spellbound from beginning to end. The author, Emily St. John Mandel, masterfully crafts a post-apocalyptic world that is both bleak and hopeful.The story follows various characters intricately connected in a post-pandemic landscape. Mandel skillfully navigates between different timelines, giving the novel a fascinating structure. Survivors of a deadly flu epidemic strive to adapt to a world devoid of electricity and modern technology.The character development is remarkable, and readers can easily identify with the diverse cast. Mandel's language is poetic and empathetic, intensifying the novel's atmosphere.\"Station Eleven\" not only prompts reflection on the fragility of our civilization but also on the significance of art and culture in a seemingly doomed world. The descriptions of abandoned cities and the search for human connection add a profound emotional dimension to the book.Overall, \"Station Eleven\" is a literary masterpiece that will captivate readers with its compelling plot and sophisticated themes. I highly recommend it, especially for those seeking a book that is intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant.Furthermore, the absence of smartphones, internet, and the inability to swiftly travel to the other end of the earth by plane underscores a haunting reality. The characters must rely on traditional forms of communication, adding an extra layer of realism to the narrative. The inability to communicate over long distances amplifies the survivors' isolation, emphasizing the fragile nature of our highly technological world. This element significantly contributes to the allure of \"Station Eleven,\" compelling readers to contemplate the impact of technological collapse on our interpersonal connections.",
