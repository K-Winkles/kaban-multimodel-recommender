                "reviewText": "I loved everything about this book\u2026It\u2019s adorable, sweet, sad, theatrical, character-collaborative-driven-in-spirit, artful, smart, emotional, intellectually rigorous, perceptive, and wonderful\u2026I could name a dozen more vertiginously exciting . . . vibrant wordsto reflect the deep satisfying experience this novel is.Even at oddball moments, Gabrielle Zevin\u2019s novel flourishes surprising wisdom touching on the most common elements of the heart\u2026..with unforgettable indelible characters.In totality\u2026\u2026.IT\u2019S ALL BRILLIANT!\u2026..and VERY ENJOYABLE!!! \u2026.the writing, narrative, structure, (the gaming), the characters: (major and minor), and their relationships are LOVABLE as can be\u2026.Sadie (Jewish-American) was one of the most brilliant people that Sam (American, part Korean and part Jewish descent) knew.He hadn\u2019t seen her in years\u2014until he did\u2014since their childhood in Southern California. Sadie went to MITSam went to Harvard\u2026..[Sam\u2019s roommate-Marx- is a crucial part of the story, too]\u2026Other favorite characters are *grandparents*\u2026 GOTTA LOVE the generations \u2014 of love\u2026.The context themes of love, loss, and life tragedies, are captured with sincerity, depth, and honesty.This book could only have been written by somebody who has experienced grief to great lengths. Zevin has an impressive imagination and proficient talent\u2026..leaving us readers with a memorable feat of storytelling, fine prose, and heartbreaking real characters.I was one of those readers who fell in love with her novel \u201cThe Storied Life of A.J. Fikry\u201d\u2026..(It wasn\u2019t too \u2018sappy\u2019 for me as it was for a few of my friends), but THIS\u2026.\u201dTomorrow, Tomorrow, Tomorrow\u201d\u2026..is more sophisticated\u2026.more fully developed\u2026.Zevin is in her prime with this novel\u2026. \u2026\u2026I can\u2019t imagine any reader \u2018disliking\u2019 it\u2026..There is something for everyone\u2026.many issues to contemplate!!!! \u2026..an examination of very profound friendships\u2014The \u2018relationship-complex-love-friendship-issues\u2019 were masterfully explored.The brilliance shines throughout\u2026\u2026 \u2026.with a look at the effects of tragedies, violence, illness, death, parents, grandparents, feelings of loneliness, fitting in, admiration for gaming designers\u2026.(especially women in the profession)\u2026love for people, love for one another, and an enhanced respect for the benefits of gaming \u2026\u2026About the aspects of \u2018gaming\u2019 \u2026. \u2026..NOBODY NEEDS TO BE DIRECTLY interested\u2026.But\u2026\u2026I realized by the end of this novel (after tearful melancholy feelings), that there are benefits from gaming\u2026.They \u2018really\u2019 must improved cognitive abilities, improved problem-solving skills and logic\u2026.BECAUSE\u2026. \u2026..the characters in this novel (who played and created these games) WERE able to apply their technical skills to their relationships. It was subtle\u2014but not-not unnoticed.So\u2026..parents: I wouldn\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t get your kid to stop playing games too much. It\u2019s amazing how much they are learning about life\u2026.in relationship to others.One more thing I must say \u2026..then I\u2019ll leave a few excerpts\u2026I thought the very beginning was MASTERFULLY written. I can\u2019t remember ever reading a book that pointed to the \u2018past, present, and the future\u2019 at the same time more magnificently. SO WELL DONE!!!Ok\u2026.enough of my excitement\u2026.Here are some excerpts: \u201cBefore Mazer invented himself as Mazer, he was Samson Mazer, and before he was Samson Mazer, he was Samson Mazur\u2014a change of two letters that transformed him from a nice ostensibly jewish boy to a Professional Builder of Worlds\u2014 and for most of his youth he was Sam\u2014S.A.M. on the hall of fame of his grandfather\u2019s \u2018Donkey Kong\u2019 machine, but mainly Sam\u201d.NOTE: the above excerpt\u2014 written at the start- is worth reading a few times. (IMO)\u2026.then let it go\u2026..it will show up in different ways through the rest of the novel. \u201cSadie! SADIE! He felt foolish. SADIE MIRANDA GREEN! YOU HAVE DIED OF DYSENTERY!\u201d \u201cFinally, she turned. She scanned the crowd slowly and when she spotted Sam, the smile spread over her face like a time-lapse video he had once seen in a high school physics class of a rose in bloom. It was beautiful, Sam thought, and perhaps, he worried, a tad ersatz. She walked over to him, still smiling\u2014one dimple on her right cheek, an almost imperceptibly wider gap between the two middle teeth on top\u2014and he thought that the crowd seemed to part for her, in a way that the world never moved for him\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s my sister who died of dysentery, Sam Masur, Sadie said. I died of exhaustion, following a snakebite\u201d. \u201cAnd of not wanting to shoot the bison, Sam said\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s wasteful. All that meat just rots\u201d. \u201cSadie through her arms around him. Sam Masur! I kept hoping I\u2019d run into you\u201d. \u201cWhat brings you to Harvard Square? Sam asked\u201d. \u201cWhy the Magic Eye, of course, she said playfully. She gestured in front of her, toward the advertisement. For the first time, Sam registered the 60-by-40-inch poster that transformed commuters into zombie horde\u201d. \u201cSEE THE WORLD IN A WHOLE NEW WAY. THIS CHRISTMAS, THE GIFT EVERYONE WANTS IS THE MAGIC EYE\u201d.Sadie\u2026.with thoseheterochromic eyes\u2026.. \u201cIn which case, the only proper thing for us to do right now is have coffee, Sam said. Or whatever you drink, if coffee\u2019s too much of a clich\u00e9 for you. Chai tea. Matcha. Snapple. Champagne. There\u2019s a world with infinite beverage possibilities, right over our heads, you know? All we have to do is ride that escalator and it\u2019s hours for the partaking\u201d. \u201cIf this were a game, he could hit pause. He could restart, say different things, the right one\u2019s this time. He could search his inventory for the item that would make Sadie not leave\u201d. \u201cYou would think women would want to stick together when there weren\u2019t many of them, but they never did. It was as if being a woman was a disease that you didn\u2019t wish to catch. As long as you didn\u2019t associate with the other women, you could imply to the majority, the men: \u2018I\u2019m not like those other ones\u2019. Sadie was, by nature, a loner, but even she found going to MIT in a female body to be an isolating experience. The year Sadie was admitted to MIT, women were slightly over a third of her class, but somehow, it felt like even less than that. Sadie sometimes felt as if she could go weeks without seeing a woman. It might have been that the men, most of them at least, assumed you were stupid if you were a woman\u201d.\u201cWhat is a game? \u2026 It\u2019s tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow. It\u2019s a possibility of infinite rebirth, infinite redemption. The idea that if you keep playing, you could win. No loss is permanent, because nothing is permanent, ever\u201d.Wonderful\u2026.as wonderful as can be!!!elysejody",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars A Love Letter to Video Games (and the friends we made along the way)",
                "reviewText": "This book seems to be sweeping the nation as the new \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars\u201c. It\u2019s got higher than 4 and a quarter stars for having 300,000 reviews, which means it\u2019s a box office smash (at least as far as books ago). So what is it about? Is it a romance? An adventure? A family saga?Kind of all three, but also not all three. It\u2019s the story of two people who create a video game company. These two, a girl and a guy, used to be friends as pre-teenagers, but had a falling out. In college, they both fall into programming which leads to video game making, which leads to the story at hand as they become friends and business partners. Also, it\u2019s about the other people that come into their life as a result of that, such as the best friend/roommate who goes from theater major to video game producer and the girl\u2019s college professor. The story takes place from 1995 up to present day.Let\u2019s talk about the two main characters. One is Sam. His trauma is that he has a foot that was broken in a million places, a handicap which has made him taciturn and stoic, though he reads like autistic\u2013overanalytical, judgemental, aloof.The second is Sadie who also found solace in video games, as her sister had childhood cancer and became the focus of the family\u2019s attention. She bonded with Sam since they both were often in the children\u2019s ward of the hospital. Sadie has bouts of depression and insecurity, even though she\u2019s a game-making genius. This leads to an affair with her foreign-born video game professor who\u2019s one of \u201cthose\u201d types (egotistical, pompous, always thinks he\u2019s right and everyone else\u2019s opinion is wrong) and much unhealthy relationshippage occurs.From the first chapter, I wasn\u2019t sure how this would go down. Since the first main character is Sam, it sounded \u201cThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\u201c. The writing sounded like writing. The dialogue did not sound like how people talk. But I gave it the benefit of the doubt and continued. It starts out almost being a sick kids romance (The Fault in Our Stars, Everything, Everything, Five Feet Apart) But I was able to get past that and into the core of the book, which is about the creation of video games\u2013what ludonarration means, video games as art, as ways to make the audience feel something.It romanticizes the idea of video game development, ignoring things like \u201ccrunch time\u201c, running a business, office politics, and other meta elements that come with complex media production. Instead, the author focuses on the relationship between the people working on the project (e.g. game producers as public figures such as Will Wright or Richard Garriott).The author is writing video games not as they were but how she wishes they could be. Which would be fine\u2026 if the majority of this book didn\u2019t take place in the past. See, the big video game they make is called \u201cIchigo\u201d and the way they talk about it, it seems to be along the lines of \u201cLimbo\u201d or \u201cUndertale\u201d. It sounds artsy and avant-garde, which would be fine if this took place today. But in 1995, there were no such things. Video games didn\u2019t make people cry in 1995. And they certainly weren\u2019t used as pack-in games for new consoles, which is what this game becomes (as part of a plot point). The top games in 1995 were Quake, Duke Nukem 3-D, Command and Conquer, Super Mario 64, etc. War games. Shooters. Well-established franchises.You couldn\u2019t be successful unless you were at least a little bit commercial. There is no freakin\u2019 way someone would have made an artsy game as the pack-in. (They weren\u2019t even using pack-ins anymore by this time.) And certainly not a game from a new unproven studio with just two people. There were no Bastions or Insides or Journeys or even Bioshocks that you could point to and say \u201chere\u2019s a successful example of the video game we\u2019re making and that\u2019s why this is going to work.\u201dSo that\u2019s what bothers me the most\u2013the backdrop is not plausible, and I pointed out a hundred times where \u201cthis wouldn\u2019t have happened\u201d, \u201cno way should this have happened\u201d, \u201cthe industry would have reamed them out if this happened\u201d. The only game during this era I could even try to point to that succeeded was \u201cMyst\u201d. And that game succeeded because it had a big new gimmick\u2013the CD-ROM which allowed complex graphics and FMVs. No such innovations in this book. It wasn\u2019t until 2003 that companies started taking chances with non-traditional games (e.g. \u201cKatamari Damacy\u201d and \u201cShadow of the Colossus\u201c).On the other hand, maybe this is the author writing about video games and how they evolved as she wishes they had been. Instead of it all being guns and gore and misogynistic heroes like Duke Nukem and Solid Snake, she wrote a universe where video games catered toward all genders instead of just guys. There\u2019s no reason video games had to be marketed toward boys. It was just what they did in the eighties because executives believed in \u201cthere are toys for boys and toys for girls and there is no crossover.\u201dThere is good writing here. I particularly fell for the beautiful chapter in the third act break (no spoilers!). If you don\u2019t know anything about video games as an industry, you will enjoy this book. If you do, you will probably be tempted to throw it away because of how unrealistically it portrays the industry. Myself, I\u2019m halfway on it. The story itself feels like something that could make an excellent Netflix short series. The video game backdrop drove me nuts, but I\u2019d be lying if I said this wasn\u2019t the kind of book I wish I could write.",

                "reviewText": "As someone with zero interest in computer games, I was surprisingly drawn into this world through the characters and their experiences with gaming throughout their lives. Indeed, this was a detailed look at growing up, the evolving of personalities through experiences, and the development of friendships, rather than gaming itself. Wonderful storylines and characters; I can see why it\u2019s been such a hit in the charts. Thoroughly justified",
