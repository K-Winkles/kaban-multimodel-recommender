                "reviewText": "The Sparrow is not a new book. It will be 20 year old next month. But I had not heard of it prior to Marion\u2019s suggestion. The Sparrow is the story of a group of people, mostly Jesuit priests, that travel to the first new alien world that has been discovered to understand the population for eventual evangelization.The story starts at the end. We know that Emilio Sandoz (one of the Jesuits that specialized in linguistics) was the only survivor of the trip. He was found by a team from a follow-up United Nations mission and sent back to earth. Once the initial introduction to the story occurs, then we start at the beginning of Sandoz\u2019s journey out of poverty through the priesthood. We see how God appears to have gathered together a team of people put at the right place and time to providentially be prepared to take on a first contact mission.Theodicy, or how a good God can permit evil, is the main focus of the book. It takes until the very end of the book to really get the story of what happened to the mission and how everyone else died and why Sandoz was found in the status that he was found in. Sandoz at the start of the book is a completely broken man, physically, mentally and spiritually. The telling of the story is in part about the care of the man who has been brutalized (in ways that are not completely unique to other missionaries in history.)The Sparrow is the first of two books and it feels incomplete. I have not picked up the second book, so maybe the second book will fully round out the story. But most reviews suggest that the second books is not quite as good as the first.Mary Doria Russell, I would have assumed was Catholic. It is interesting that like The Book of Strange New Things, which The Sparrow is often compared to, neither was written by Christians. Mary Doria Russell is Jewish, as is one of the main characters. The question of theodicy is both a Jewish and Christian question. In many ways, fiction seems to be a better place to handle the question than straight theology.I think this was a very engaging novel. The method of going back and forth in time makes sense to the way that the author seems to want to reveal the story, but I did find it a bit annoying at times. I was also a bit annoyed that after more than 15 hours of audiobook, it still felt like an unfinished story (and I do think that was intentional).I am somewhat surprised that I have not really seen anyone compare it to Endo\u2019s Silence. Both books are about Jesuit missionaries, both have to deal with the reality of faith in the face of serious evil perpetrated not only on themselves but on those around them. They are much more alike than The Book of Strange New Things is similar to The Sparrow. The Book of Strange New Things and The Sparrow both are about the idea of how Christianity relates to aliens as one of their themes, but other than the setting, the books are really not related.This is not a book you want to read if you want everything to work out nicely or without some real questions. But it is a book that handles faith well and for its weaknesses I still strongly recommend it. It is yet another example of \u2018secular\u2019 books handling questions of faith better than most Christian fiction.There is some real content warning on the book (violence, sex, torture and language). But none of it is gratuitous and it all makes sense in the context of the book and its themes.",

                "reviewText": "\u201cSo many Homeric stories. So many martyrs like Isaac Jogues. Trekking eight hundred miles into the interior of the New World\u2014a land as alien to a European in 1637 as [this planet] is to us now\u2026\u201d (p159)Wow! What an extraordinary novel \u2013 not at all what I expected. It\u2019s one of the best I\u2019ve read in years.The book doesn\u2019t feel like speculative science fiction as you\u2019ve come to know it. Instead, it reads more like high quality historical fiction. It\u2019s neither a stretch nor a spoiler to suggest that it\u2019s a radical rethinking of the story of seventeenth century Jesuit missionary Isaac Jogues.Don\u2019t expect much futurism: life in 2060 looks a lot like it does now. You\u2019ll be fine with that. Characters, cultures, and relationships drive the story, which delivers so much insight, humor, mystery, joy, tension, surprise, and unspeakable tragedy that you won\u2019t need or want distracting accounts of newfangled gadgets. You\u2019ll be too busy holding your breath, following the breadcrumbs, pondering purpose, meaning, impact and implication. The more you read, the better it gets. And, as they say, you won\u2019t see it coming.Be sure to read the afterword and interview with the author \u2013 they are very interesting.I could say more; it\u2019s tempting to tell you a bit about the book\u2019s big themes and the author\u2019s point of view. But why? This is, after all, a review, not a recap. So enough \u2013 I need to go read the sequel.",

                "reviewText": "At over 500 pages counting the Afterword and appendices, \"The Sparrow\" is too thick for me to find room for it on my shelves, so I am sending it to a beloved (and celibate) ex-girlfriend who years ago sent me Martin Scorsese's passion project \"Silence,\" about Jesuits in Japan in the seventeenth century. I couldn't think of a person who would more want to read a story about the first Jesuits to go to Alpha Centauri.The aliens on a planet orbiting the smallest of the three suns that make up the Centauri system are very different from those in \"The Three-Body Problem,\" another very popular novel in which it turns out there is intelligent life there. They are just beginning to see what radio can be used for and one of the first transmissions of their music is picked up by an astronomer at the Arecibio Radio Telescope in Puerto Rico. One of the first people he tells that he has picked up an extraterrestrial signal is the hero of the book, Jesuit priest Emilio Sandoz, who has recently returned home to the island after years of short-term missions to deprived people all over Earth. He immediately recruits the astronomer, his three other closest friends, and three other Jesuits to travel to the planet, named Rakhat by its inhabitants, in a hollowed-out asteroid at an average of 25% of c.Mary Doria Russell's only mistake with this book was setting it within her own lifetime (it starts in the mid-2010s). It will probably be the 2110s before we have Australians on Mars and miners throughout the asteroid belt (assuming we can avoid a Third World War or comprehensive environmental collapse). The book ends in 2060, when as one character observes the population of Earth is nearly 16 billion (which isn't going to happen by then, or probably ever). Even in the 2010s the technological singularity is approaching; you pretty much need to have a Ph.D. to have a job. Most other jobs are being handed over to AIs taught by the last humans to do those jobs and set up by indentured servants like Sofia Mendes, the second-most compelling character in the book.I caught myself doing something that these days, I only do for the best novels: casting the movie version in my head. The thing is, like \"Dune,\" this book is too sprawling to be told with a single two- or even three-hour movie. It is divided into 3 acts, each of which should be its own movie. The first act is Sandoz's life and friendships on Earth and on the (from their perspective brief) journey inside the asteroid to Rakhat. The second act is Rakhat itself. These two acts are told in flashback through the memory of Sandoz, who in the third act is the only human who makes it back alive (though horribly maimed) to Earth. The first movie could be named \"Scientists,\" the second could be \"Missionaries\" and the third could only be \"Priests\" since literally everyone Sandoz interacts with after returning to Earth is a Jesuit.Maybe I would change a few things for the third movie (such as giving the humans more than one rifle, which might have changed the course of events), but nothing for the first two. I really shouldn't have wanted a happy ending for this book. It is too powerful. Six stars.",

                "reviewText": "This is one of the few books that I have read in recent months that I have found difficultt o put down and yet did not want it to end. The story has stayed with me and I find myself returning to some of its themes. Russlee employs a science fiction background to explore themes of friendship, belief, trust, powere and accepted conventions to an effective degree. Providing one is able to suspend disbelief regarding the means of interstelllar travel ( using adapted asteroids) then all else becomes believable and a challenging to read. The key character - Father Emilio Sandoz - is a jesuit priest with a skill in languages and conflict regarding his postion in the priesthood. His early life has mirrored the jesuit philosopy of evangelization and exploration but by he time the novel begins doubst have begin to arise. Responding to a signal from a planet ( Rakhat) he and a small group of people set forth on what can be seen as a 'mission' to explore the source of the signal. Events rapidly unravel espcially when contact is made with the indigenous population which had, over the centuries, evolved into two distinct groups and a stable society but one whose practices are unethical to the mission group.The loss of the original party, the misunderstandings that arise especially regarding contact with the ruling Ja'anata and the struggle Emilio Sandozundergoes regarding his belief in a god and his postion in the jesuit order are beautifully told and I am still mulling over some of the points to come out of the book. There is no facile redemption in this book and the ending is uncomfortable. I would suggest, also, reading \" Children of God\" which is essentiallya sequel and in whihc many of the unfinshed threads of the first book are bought together. Also not an easy read but worthy of another 5 stars",
