I gave it five stars because I thought it was very well written and it really is a very good book but it had my nerves on edge throughout the whole course of the story. There\u2019s darkness about it and this is no ordinary mountain climb. Our protagonist is Harry Tunmore, a loner who\u2019s gone through immense heartache and grief and come out of the other side a rather sad and bitter man. He\u2019s been recruited with several others to climb a mountain that\u2019s appeared out of nowhere in the middle of nowhere basically just to find out what\u2019s at the top and it\u2019s not going to be easy. Hitchcock \u2018God rest his soul\u201d could have made a very good movie out of this tragic tale.",

                "reviewText": "Binge's first book, PROFESSOR EVERYWHERE (pictured), was a slow-burn, high-brow thriller with incredible, earned twists.ASCENSION, in every way, improves upon those same principles.In ASCENSION, a mysterious mountain appears in the middle of the ocean and a team goes to investigate. Binge absolutely nails the tone: a dark foreboding of things to come, enough suspense to keep me reading all night, and characters that stick with you well after you're done reading. Binge brought real heart to the story - something completely unexpected in the speculative thriller genre. Deeply moving, ASCENSION brings trauma directly to the forefront of a mysterious mountain adventure, forcing the main character to confront his darkest hours while set on a Lovecraftian ascent into madness.I loved the way the story unfolded, constantly adding, yet without muddying the purpose and feeling of the book. The narrative structure (recovered letters from a man in an asylum) brings clarity to a pulse-pounding question: was Harold mad? Or did these things really happen?Binge captures the reader from the first few pages and delivers on his promises throughout the book. 5/5, would absolutely recommend!",

The idea itself of a strange structure appearing out of nowhere wasn't new, but all the little details were. I loved that the book was written as basically just letters, and the way the story progressed through them. It felt as though I got continuously confused along with the characters, I was totally gripped. At no time did I feel bored, the pacing was great. I also rarely like endings, but this one felt quite right. Really great book, give it a read.",

                "reviewText": "Wow - I was drawn to this book the moment I saw the advert for it. The only book in a very long time to keep me up at night - and wanting the day to rush by so I could carry on reading it.It very well written - and I didn\u2019t need to keep rereading to understand the complex story line.It\u2019s not a book I normally read - and I am so glad I did. It\u2019s thought provoking, spiritual and at the end of the book I was left with more questions than answers - not because of the storyline but the topic. Simple and complex all rolled into one.I loved it and have raved about it so much to my hubby - that he who never reads novels is going to read it - so we can discuss it afterwards.Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I read a couple of positive reviews, thought I'd give the book a go. I gave up at page 150. I couldn't tell what kind of book it was trying to be, the story felt really long and drawn out and the writing felt like it was still at a draft stage. I think the writer should decide on one genre and stick to it.",

                "reviewText": "I really love books that feature an expedition or climbing a mountain and creepy things start happening (I just love Michelle Paver\u2019s books!) so when I read the premise for Ascension it sounded like exactly my cup of tea. Told through a series of letters our protagonist writes to his niece, the story follows scientist Harold Tunmore as he\u2019s invited on an expedition to explore a mountain that has appeared in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. On arrival strange and mysterious things start happening and the higher they go the more questions arise. Can Harold and his team unravel the mystery of the mountain and will they make it out alive?This book has such a compelling premise and it is executed so well. I really enjoyed the way the story was told in letters and Binge\u2019s writing was so easy to get lost in. The story is paced well and Binge does an amazing job of slowly increasing that sense of unease and paranoia as the expedition climbs higher. There were certainly some really tense, creepy moments and more than a few that sent a shiver down my spine.Ascension is quite a quick paced book that incorporates science fiction, thriller, and horror elements that make you not want to look away. Our main protagonist Harold is a really complex character, dealing with grief and the loss of everything he once knew. I really liked seeing the dynamics between the characters change as they realised just how much danger they were in.Binge does a great job of keeping the reader guessing and I was never really sure where the story was going to go. Ascension is a gripping page turner and one that I did not want to put down. Ascension is a hugely enjoyable read and I am looking forward to reading more from Nicholas Binge in the future.",
