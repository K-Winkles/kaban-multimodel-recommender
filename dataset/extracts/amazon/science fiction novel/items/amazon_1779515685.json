                "reviewText": "Our plot: It's Supergirl's 21st birthday, and she's decided to get drunk to celebrate! But it's really hard to get Kryptonians drunk, so she takes her super-dog Krypto and travels to a far distant planet under a red sun so she can lose most of her powers. And once Kara's gotten there and gotten thoroughly sloshed, she gets roped into helping out a young alien teenager named Ruthye Marye Knoll. Ruthye's father was murdered by a creep called Krem of the Yellow Hills, and she wants revenge more than anything in the galaxy. But a teenaged girl can't kill a killer without help, and she wants the Maid of Might's aid in her quest.Well, that's nice, kid, but Supergirl isn't really for hire, and she doesn't kill. So she's gonna hop into her spaceship and fly back to somewhere with a yellow sun and -- and that's when Krem of the Yellow Hills shows up and shoots Supergirl with a few arrows. Luckily, even mostly unpowered Kryptonians are tough enough to survive arrows -- but Krypto isn't so tough against Krem's poisoned arrows -- and even worse, Krem steals Supergirl's spaceship, too! Well, Kara still isn't willing to kill Krem, but she does need to find out what poison he used so someone can brew up an antidote for Krypto, so she decides to accompany Ruthye to help apprehend the killer.What follows is a lengthy mission across space as Supergirl and Ruthye pursue Krem. That includes traveling coach on a space freighter filled with sometimes hostile aliens. That includes visiting a small town of little blue aliens who like to appear friendly and are very definitely not friendly. That includes learning of the monstrous depravity and cruelty visited upon dozens of innocent worlds by Krem's new allies in Barbond's Brigands. That includes getting stranded on a planet orbiting a deadly green Kryptonite sun. It includes outrunning certain death. It includes battling an alien armada. It includes watching a friend die. It includes making the ultimate decision: life or death.Tom King's comics tend to focus on the dark inner psyches of his characters, usually B-level or lower superheroes, like the Vision, Mister Miracle, and the Omega Men. We get less of that here, partly because angsty Supergirl has been done plenty of times and it's no longer interesting, and partly because Ruthye is actually the lead character of the book. Ruthye narrates the tale, Ruthye is in the story from the beginning to the end, Ruthye is the one who learns and grows as a character.Not that Supergirl is a bit player in the tale. She does a lot to smooth the path they take -- Kryptonian strength, flight, speed, and other powers help a lot, of course. She also has a nose for justice that leads her to work to punish wrongdoers, as well as a compassionate heart that helps her to comfort those who are suffering. She has her moments of darkness, too, particularly when she remembers the slow, painful death of Argo City, the final remnant of Krypton, the few survivors dying of Kryptonite radiation, no matter what is done to help.King also admits that the plot is a loose homage to Charles Portis' Western novel \"True Grit,\" which may give you a hint of some -- but definitely not all -- of the story beats.Bilquis Evely's art is worth admiring, too. It's very much unlike anything we've seen in comics in ages. The art style has its roots in the late 19th century and early 20th, particularly in Art Nouveau, and character design pulls its influences from the past, too. Though Supergirl's costume is the classic and traditional superhero outfit, most of the rest of the characters draw inspiration from the art of Charles Dana Gibson, particularly his glamorous Gibson Girls. That means everyone is beautiful (okay, everyone except the alien monsters), the eyes are riveting, and the hair is flowing and luxurious.That turn-of-the-century design aesthetic dominates the rest of the book, too. Many costumes are ornate and old-fashioned, like they came out of illustrations for an old planetary romance. Some of the spaceships have sails. The alien town of Maypole looks like one of the American small towns in Ray Bradbury stories.Evely's gorgeous artwork probably gets more attention than King's storytelling -- but that's okay, because her art is genuinely amazing, and probably did more to sell the book to many readers than anything else.Should you read it? Heck, yeah, kids, get yourself a copy and get busy reading.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ll be honest. When I started the book I was enthralled by Evely\u2019s artwork. But I thought I was going to be reading a book about more punches and kicks, so I was a bit bored with the start of the book. I am so glad I kept going allowing the storytelling, depicted amazingly by Evely, to change it around for me. As I moved from book to book I started seeing the story in another way - that the journey to your \u2018goal\u2019 can be as important as accomplishing that goal. It was after reading the 3rd or 4th account of Krem of the Yellow Hills\u2018 actions, and seeing how the aftermath of each people\u2019s experience were measured against Kara herself and her own story - BOOM! light bulb went off and I was left feeling stupid for not appreciating the nuance of it. It was a beautiful and bittersweet story. I loved Ruthye\u2019s honesty and straightforwardness. I cried during Kara\u2019s backstory, thinking about my own daughter, asking myself \u2018if she were to ever be thrown into equally harsh experiences, could she persevere like her\u2019. I hope she would. I loved the dynamic between Ruthye and Kara, especially at the very end. When put into perspective against the entire journey I actually had a good laugh.",

You don't need to be a fan following some plot that is 4+ years long to get drawn in and love the story. Anyone could pick it up and just sail away into this amazing cosmic adventure. Grand, heartfelt, profound and just a fun romp through a universe teeming with wonder, danger and adventure. Bilquis Everly's artwork is just the stuff of magic, carefully considered lines and museum level panels that take your breath away. Matheus Lopes' coloring is nothing to sneeze at either, he provides the emotional spectrum in color to punctuate every scene. This Absolutely deserves the Absolute edition treatment.",

This Supergirl has a huge capability to understand pain and suffering and losses, though she might be slightly arrogant and impatient sometimes to her enemies. This is what makes her an unique and interesting character with depth.Many many kudos to the artist for not sexualising Kara, portraying her in a respectful manner, and her highly detailed drawings! I also admire all colour palettes used in this run that brings out the cosmic, dreamy vibre. As a lover of visual art, I would say the artwork is pure perfection.Overall, this is an excellent run and the reading experience is a very pleasant one! This is definitely my favourite run!",

                "reviewText": "Quando Kara Zor-El completa 21 anos, ela parte para um planeta que orbita um sol vermelho. Sem os benef\u00edcios que a radia\u00e7\u00e3o amarela traz para seu corpo, ela pode ter experi\u00eancias com aquilo que n\u00e3o est\u00e1 acostumada.Ocorre que sua hist\u00f3ria se cruzar\u00e1 com uma recente trag\u00e9dia de onde se encontra. Uma jovem garota chamada Ruthye est\u00e1 na busca de um mercen\u00e1rio que possa lhe trazer uma sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de justi\u00e7a ap\u00f3s encontrar seu pai assassinado em suas terras, e ser\u00e1 a\u00ed que a Supergirl passar\u00e1 a agir. A trama \u00e9 narrada atrav\u00e9s das lembran\u00e7as da menina, sendo que somos levados a acreditar que a Garota de A\u00e7o presenciar\u00e1 e far\u00e1 coisas que n\u00e3o estamos acostumados a ver.Posso estar enganado, mas a sensa\u00e7\u00e3o da leitura me fez pensar numa trama de \u201c(re)amadurecimento\u201d, colocando a todo momento a personagem a prova do que poderia faz\u00ea-la subverter os seus princ\u00edpios, por\u00e9m, demonstrando que sua compaix\u00e3o \u00e9 muito maior do que os outros esperam.Ao longo dos oito cap\u00edtulos, Ruthye e Kara vivenciar\u00e3o experi\u00eancias que colocam a prova a \u201chumanidade\u201d da Supergirl, veremos facetas nunca antes imaginadas e como Tom King consegue trabalhar com estes conceitos de uma forma que entregue uma hist\u00f3ria ao seu estilo (sem perder a ess\u00eancia que estamos acostumados com a personagem).O que merece destaque \u00e9 a arte da Bilquis Evely (com cores de Mat Lopes)! Ela apresentou um trabalho bel\u00edssimo com enquadramentos que refletem a for\u00e7a que o roteiro tem, assim como vimos em \u201cO Sonhar\u201d recentemente.Esta publica\u00e7\u00e3o foi indicada ao Pr\u00eamio Eisner 2022 na categoria Melhor Miniss\u00e9rie, demonstrando ser um bom material para quem quer ler algo da personagem sem a necessidade de conhecimento pr\u00e9vio.",
