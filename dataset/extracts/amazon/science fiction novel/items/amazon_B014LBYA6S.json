        "description": "The thrilling follow-up to the New York Times best-selling novel One Second After. Months before publication, One Second After was cited on the floor of Congress as a book all Americans should have, a book discussed in the corridors of the Pentagon as a truly realistic look at the dangers of EMPs. An EMP is a weapon with the power to destroy the entire United States in a single act of terrorism in a single second; Indeed, it is a weapon that the Wall Street Journal warns could shatter America. One Second After was a dire warning of what might be our future... and our end. One Year After returns to the small town of Black Mountain and the man who struggled to rebuild it in the wake of devastation: John Matherson. It is a thrilling follow-up and should delight fans in every way. Read more",

                "reviewText": "One year after an EMP strike against the United States leaves the once-powerful nation crippled, the North Carolina town of Black Mountain has managed to survive and regain some self-reliance. However, things are far from normal. They must return to farming techniques to ensure a steady supply of food, medicines are in short supply, as is fuel and communications. Students have been drafted into the local militia and spend an equal time protecting their community from gangs looking to steal in order to survive. Still, in all this, the town leader, John Matherson, has managed to create a sense of hope for his family and friends.This changes when a federal administrator arrives and informs the citizens most of the eligible people will be drafted in a new army and dispersed throughout the former nation to bring order in trouble spots. This does not sit well when it is learned cities throughout former America have descended into chaos and proven to be quite capable of defeating regular army troops. But Matherson is left with two choices: submit or refuse.When it becomes clear the federal administrator has a different set of goals in mind for the future of Black Mountain, John Matherson is ready to do the unthinkable.... But will his family and townsfolk support him?This apocalyptic series is a good follow-up from One Second After. Tells how things may turn out if the U.S. suffers an EMP strike. From the way politics are today, I don't believe the author is far from wrong. His book is a page-turner. 4 stars instead of 5 because his story is sort of similar to others, but the author does a good job of detailing how people react in times of crisis and what might become of all of us should this unthinkable, but possible, scenario be in our future. Hope it remains only a story.",

Don\u2019t get me wrong but it makes it like a cliche. What I wished for was something more insidious and in shadow. This did have little of it but focused on high pace storyline instead. I would still encourage you to read it anyway.",

                "reviewText": "I really enjoy this author!It blows my mind that to date our government, and even \"The Donald\", has not seriously addressed hardening the US power grid against an EMP attack! Like an asteroid hit, the probability of such an event depends largely on the timeline one is willing to consider. An event unlikely in five years, may be probable and even unavoidable in fifty!And the tech needed to prosecute an EMP Attack is not all that elusive to many Third World Powers--especially today!Clearly, most US Representatives put their careers first and foremost, as they realize that their relevance to us will vanish as quickly as the grid collapses. So, why bother?This story is the anticipated sequel to the ground breaking \"One Second After\".Yes, I checked \"Predictable\"; but that's only because the author taught me how to think in the first novel.I thoroughly enjoyed this read, as an ad hoc government of unelected \"leaders\" seizes control of the military and attempts to install a \"new order\" in place of the constitutional government so many have given so much to defend.Clearly, William Forstchen understands human behavior and how today's world works, along with what history has taught us over a considerable timeline. I'm glad someone smarter than me is paying attention.This is a must-read for those who've read and enjoyed \"One Second After\". \"One Year After\" is the necessary sequel to the mind-stretching first installment, of what might prove to be a dire prediction of the very near future. And it's such a pity--because we COULD fix this!While \"preppers\" are kindly considered \"eccentrics\", and not so kindly, \"nutjobs\" in today's society, if something like this--or the asteroid--ever hits, they'll be brilliantly vindicated as the \"wise and insightful\", if not outright \"prophetic\" among us.The transition from a skeptical \"Really?\" to an obvious \"Duh!\", can manifest itself in a virtual heartbeat. Why any US citizen that's able, would not have a supply of clean drinking water and storable food on hand, completely mystifies me...RayB",

I have to say that I was not disappointed and that all three books tell a story of what could easily happen if society lost all its electric & electronic equpment. One of the phrases in the books that has stuck in my mind is that we currently live in just about the most fragile society mankind has ever lived in and that, in most Westernised socities today, we are totally dependent on a very complex supply and infrastructure system and Heaven help us if anything major happens to all of that. A series of books well worth reading and totally unputdownable!",

                "reviewText": "Excellente trilogie, \"One second after\", \"One year after\", \"The final day\", sur les cons\u00e9quences d'une EMP.Les explosions type EMP (Electro magnetic pulse) sont presque totalement inconnus du grand public en France et ignor\u00e9s de nos politiciens, m\u00eame si quelques militaires ont tir\u00e9 la sonnette d'alarme, dans le d\u00e9sert.Pour r\u00e9sumer, un missile nucl\u00e9aire tir\u00e9 \u00e0 une certaine altitude dans l'atmosph\u00e8re, au dessus d'une zone donn\u00e9e, qui peut-\u00eatre de la taille d'un pays ou plusieurs, peut neutraliser l'ensemble du syst\u00e8me \u00e9lectrique de la zone donn\u00e9e. Concr\u00e8tement, cela veut dire que physiquement nous ne percevrions rien ou pas grand chose, peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame pas l'explosion et au premier abord, il n'y aurait rien de visible au sol sauf des transformateurs et des lignes fondus. Mais la totalit\u00e9 du r\u00e9seau \u00e9lectrique s'arr\u00eaterait instantan\u00e9ment de fonctionner ainsi que la tous les v\u00e9hicules ayant de l'\u00e9lectronique et bien s\u00fbr trains, avions, camions, etc.C'est \u00e0 dire que seule la jeep de collection ou le tracteur de arri\u00e8re grand papa pourrait continuer \u00e0 rouler, plus des v\u00e9hicules ou des installations sp\u00e9cialement prot\u00e9g\u00e9es, mais il n'y en a quasiment pas en France. Toutes les communications t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques et informatiques seraient suspendues. Le r\u00e9seau et les appareils \u00e9tant \"fondus\" (pour faire court), il faudrait des mois ou des ann\u00e9es pour reconstruire le monde actuel, selon l'\u00e9tendue de la zone ou des zones touch\u00e9es.La trilogie de W. R. Forstchen raconte les cons\u00e9quences d'une telle catastrophe survenant sur le continent US, vues depuis une petite ville des Blacks Montains en Virginie.W. R Forstchen est un historien, sp\u00e9cialiste des XVIII\u00e8me et XIX\u00e8me si\u00e8cle US d'o\u00f9 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de son r\u00e9cit soci\u00e9tal d'un \"retour vers le pass\u00e9\". Pour toutes les cons\u00e9quences d'un EMP, il a travaill\u00e9 en collaboration avec un de ses amis, sp\u00e9cialiste militaire car les Am\u00e9ricains, \"eux\", comme les Russes ou les Chinois ou les Isra\u00e9liens travaillent sur le sujet.Le r\u00e9cit est extraordinaire de \"r\u00e9alisme\", assez dur parfois, mais parfaitement coh\u00e9rent sur ce qui se passerait dans un monde priv\u00e9 de ravitaillement, de m\u00e9dicaments, de communications et correspond aux pr\u00e9visions des experts sur le sujet.90% de la population mourrait en 1 an, dont la presque totalit\u00e9 des habitants des grandes villes.Les survivants appartiendraient \u00e0 de petites communaut\u00e9s soud\u00e9es, cr\u00e9ant leur milice de d\u00e9fense et mettant en place une protection de leur zone contre les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s. Eh oui, c'est terrible, mais quand il n'y a plus \u00e0 manger pour tout le monde et presque plus de m\u00e9dicaments, on arr\u00eate d'accueillir toute la mis\u00e8re du monde, il faut choisir entre les siens et les autres et, parmi les autres, trier les savoirs utiles en revenant \u00e0 ce qui est v\u00e9ritablement utile dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Il en fut ainsi dans toutes les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s pendant des mill\u00e9naires. C'est \u00e0 dire plus de place, ni d'espoir pour le licenci\u00e9 en droit , sciences po, ou en lettres mais une petite place pour le chasseur, le m\u00e9canicien, l'infirmi\u00e8re, le forgeron, le collectionneur d'antiquit\u00e9s ou l'historien des techniques.Les interrogations humaines des survivants et du h\u00e9ros principal, ancien colonel de l'arm\u00e9e US, professeur d'histoire de l'universit\u00e9 locale, leur souci de se raccrocher \u00e0 des principes tir\u00e9s de la constitution US, de l'histoire US, de la religion, les rend plus vrais et donne du corps au r\u00e9cit, rappelant qu'aucune soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ne se construit ou ne se reconstruit sans un fondement id\u00e9ologique.Ok, il y a quelques guerres, un peu \u00e0 la John Wayne. Un commentateur a trouv\u00e9 l'attaque d'une arm\u00e9e de voyous peu cr\u00e9dible. En ce qui me concerne, je la trouve non seulement hautement cr\u00e9dible car les voyous croulent d\u00e9j\u00e0 sous les armes en tout genre, mais serait \u00e9galement les 1ers a \u00eatre organis\u00e9s en bandes arm\u00e9es, en mesure de piller armureries et autres lieux de stockage d'armes en cas de catastrophe.Pire, la France n'est pas les USA ou la Suisse o\u00f9 tout citoyen a le droit de poss\u00e9der une arme y compris de guerre.En France, des s\u00e9ries de lois, qui auront peut-\u00eatre un jour des circonstances catastrophiques, ont priv\u00e9 les honn\u00eates citoyens de presque toutes leurs armes. Ce n'est pas les fusils des chasseurs \"fran\u00e7ais\" et leur m\u00e9diocre provision de cartouches qui iraient loin face \u00e0 des AK 47 ou des colt 45 qui sont monnaie courante dans certains lieux qu'on ne citera pas. C'est donc la quasi-totalit\u00e9 des citoyens honn\u00eates qui seraient incapables de se d\u00e9fendre si une guerre civile survenait, quelle que cause que ce soit.Effrayant de comprendre \u00e0 quel point, on serait vuln\u00e9rable dans notre pays car je n'ai pu m'emp\u00eacher de faire des parall\u00e8les entre ce qui serait possible dans une petite ville des USA et dans une petite ville de France.Serait \u00e0 offrir aux candidats \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidentielle pour qu'ils r\u00e9fl\u00e9chissent aux cons\u00e9quences gravissimes des absurdit\u00e9s de leurs choix et de leur bien pensance, tous partis confondus depuis 1/2 si\u00e8cle.",
