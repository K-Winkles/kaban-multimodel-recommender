                "reviewText": "\"Magic, like grief, could come welling up. The difference was how grief slammed into you without any kind of ceremony or invitation. Magic you could use. Grief just used you up.\"-The Book of MoThank you to Random House and NetGalley for the ARC.To say that The Book of Love is nothing short of spectacular would be doing the novel a great disservice. This book was entertaining, captivating, beautiful in its entirety, and a definite re-read for my bookshelf. Combined with a near-lyrical prose and fable-like incredulity, Kelly Link creates a world that is entirely too familiar and yet vastly impossible, along with characters that are whole and complete in their own right.The Book of Love, through a myriad of point-of-view perspectives, follows a small group of New Englanders a year after they died. Laura, Daniel, and Mo mysteriously disappeared one night and have been presumed dead. Pulled back to life by their high school music teacher, Mr. Anabin, they are given a chance to reclaim their previous lives as if nothing happened, as long as they can discover how they died that fateful night.All of these characters, ranging from upright and sensible Laura, to her wild and grief-stricken sister Susannah; dutiful and loyal Daniel; sarcastic and wiser than his years Mo; and even mysterious and fluid Bowie, have complex and in-depth stories that are laid out in the tiniest puzzle pieces. It is a feat for authors to not only create such vastly different personalities, but to show us their wants and vulnerabilities in such tender increments.What also captivated me was the system of magic Kelly Link creates. At times frightful and dark, and other times whimsical in a Hayao Miyazaki-esque grandeur, this book invites you to get swept away, to throw out all sense of reality, and to go with the flow. There are references to pop culture that don't feel entirely dated or forced, and combined with a tilted writing style, there is so much to devour and enjoy on every page.I loved this Book of Love, and I don't think anyone will be able to let me be silent about it.",

                "reviewText": "I chose to read this book because I recognized the author from an earlier book I enjoyed, and also because the description caught by attention because I like fantasy and this one sounded interesting.Description:Late one night, Laura, Daniel, and Mo find themselves beneath the fluorescent lights of a high school classroom, almost a year after disappearing from their hometown, the small seaside community of Lovesend, Massachusetts, having long been presumed dead. Which, in fact, they are.With them in the room is their previously unremarkable high school music teacher, who seems to know something about their disappearance\u2014and what has brought them back again. Desperate to reclaim their lives, the three agree to the terms of the bargain their music teacher proposes. They will be given a series of magical tasks; while they undertake them, they may return to their families and friends, but they can tell no one where they\u2019ve been. In the end, there will be winners and there will be losers.But their resurrection has attracted the notice of other supernatural figures, all with their own agendas. As Laura, Daniel, and Mo grapple with the pieces of the lives they left behind, and Laura\u2019s sister, Susannah, attempts to reconcile what she remembers with what she fears, these mysterious others begin to arrive, engulfing their community in danger and chaos, and it becomes imperative that the teens solve the mystery of their deaths to avert a looming disaster.My Thoughts:The prose is beautiful and is atmospheric in nature - almost like a fairy tale. There is a good story here. I liked some of the names: the band name is My Two Hands Both Knowe You; the coffee shop is What Hast Thou Ground?; and one of the magical characters is called Carousel. I thought those names were fun. I liked how some of the characters could turn into animals using their magical ability. Unfortunately, and I'm likely in the minority here, I found the book to be overly long and I was bored through a little over half of the book. I had to force myself through. Luckily the second half of the book had a little more movement to it. Also, I couldn't get invested in any of the characters. Nothing made me feel anything while I was reading this. It is not likely that I will recommend this one to my friends.Thanks to Random House Publishing Group through Netgalley for an advance copy. Expected publication on February 13, 2024.",
