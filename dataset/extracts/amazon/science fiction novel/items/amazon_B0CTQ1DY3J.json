Giving ships and training is hoped to build bridges. Sadly an opponent from Williams past shows up and begins a campaign to destroy him and everything he holds dear. I liked it and am looking forward to the fallout from the treasure trove of information recovered in the raid on the pirate base. It might be an opertunity for the empire to clean house. Or for another civil war depending on how the emperor reacts.",
