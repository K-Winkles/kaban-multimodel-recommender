            "Editorial Reviews Review \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Reviewed By Kristen Van Kampen (Teen Reviewer) for Readers' FavoriteWhen The Girl Who Looked Beyond the Stars by L. B. Anne begins, Sheena Meyer is just an ordinary girl, but that doesn't last long. Her life changes when her father gets in a car accident and she goes to the hospital to see him, where she also sees a glowing creature that miraculously heals her dad. It is also the first time she meets Mr. Tobias, who says she's a gleamer who can see things normal people can't. Suddenly, mystical things keep happening to her, including vivid dreams that come true, text messages from an unknown number, and she meets a mysterious new girl who acts oddly. Then, in one of her talks with Mr. Tobias, she learns that something called the Murk is coming for her. What will she do?With interesting scenes and well-developed characters, The Girl Who Looked Beyond the Stars by L. B. Anne is a very enjoyable read. The book has a good balance of thrilling and dramatic scenes and funny parts that make the book exciting without making it too intense. The characters were very likable and relatable, and I thought the way the characters interacted was very realistic, especially between Sheena and her mother. I also loved the way Sheena and her friends were very close and joked around with each other. The book was very well written and I liked the narration style from Sheena's perspective. The story is original, suspenseful, and has a very interesting plot. I was hooked by the first page and didn't want to stop reading. I would definitely recommend this book.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Safe, clean, great reads for middle schoolers! Amazon ReviewerI have a 13 year old daughter who loves to read but we are really cautious over what she reads. She is also really picky about what she reads so finding something we approve and she likes can be a challenge. I read all 3 books in the series before giving them to her and loved them myself! They're we're a fun light read as an adult and they were safe but interesting for a middle schooler to read. The first day I had her start reading she read 11 chapters in The Girl Who Looked Beyond the Stars because she couldn't put it down! She can't wait to read more and says she'll finish all 3 quick because they're so good and she has to know what happens! Also love that the main characters are black and they talk about curly hair, it's great for my daughter to read books with characters who represent what she looks like. Thankful I found these books for my daughter!\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 I'm just elated mother who wanted to extend her light to you on behalf of my little Queen! I purchased The Girl Who Looked Beyond the Stars in May 2021 for my daughter's monthly book haul. I have only one word to describe her reaction: GLUED!From beginning to end, my daughter was enthused and couldn't help but share how much Sheena and herself are alike. I can't thank you enough for creating such a phenomenal series. You've given young ladies of color the opportunity to see themselves in world of fantasy that doesn't showcase melanin enough.Your voice has impacted my daughter's life and for that we are ETERNALLY grateful!My daughter is eager to continue the series. We extend our love and light ALWAYS in ALL WAYS!"

For 11-14-year-old readers who enjoy books such as A Wrinkle In Time.\"\"Do you believe in angels?\"\"The Girl Who Captured the Stars, the first book in author L.B. Anne's Sheena Meyer series is fantastic! I like how Sheena figures out she has powers, and how she trusts her friends but wants to protect them also. Some parts of the story are sad. Some parts of the story are scary. But some parts of the story are so funny, they made me laugh out loud!\" Amazon Reviewer\"What am I?\"Sheena Meyer is the girl who brings an extra lunch to school each day just in case someone doesn't have lunch. She's also the girl who questions and investigates everything, driving her parents and teachers nuts. She spends most days waiting for some grand event to happen and change her life, but she won't have to wait much longer.The Murk is coming for her because of a gift she doesn't know she has.Nine years ago an angel appeared in front of select kids all over the world. In Michigan, it appeared in a willow tree in front of a four-year-old little girl. She's the only child who saw it, the one with the gift. Sheena is now thirteen and has since forgotten what she saw. But things change when her father is in a terrible accident, and she witnesses a supernatural being save him.\"I saw what you did. Come Back!\"An elderly man, a peculiar new kid at school, and mysterious text messages will change everything Sheena has ever believed in, sweeping her out of a humdrum, teenage, existence, and setting in motion what one little girl's destiny can mean to the world.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Safe, clean, great reads for middle schoolers!

The characters are well rounded, the use of spiritual concepts so far are appropriate for youth and I appreciate that the parents and adults are mainly depicted as allies albeit protective. I hope this continues to be a book for young people that portrays parents and adults in harmony and protective authority over the youth in their sphere of influence. Cannot wait to read more. Excellent easy to read, and exciting adventure.So far, this will be on my Christmas list for a number of youth in my circle of friends and family.",

                "reviewText": "Character-driven teen/preteen story about angels. Christianity is definitely in there, but not pushy, just as the ground of Sheena\u2019s life. Sheena is an interesting person, at once strong for justice and caring about others, while also flawed and human. Her relationships with other kids are also outside the usual mode: she sees the cliques at school very clearly but also feels she shares something with all of them. She has few friends but lots of people she interacts with, and cares a lot for the little boy next door, while also sometimes wishing he\u2019d leave her alone. It\u2019s a more balanced portrayal than most, and her emotions and reactions feel age-appropriate and right for who she is. The author walks a fine line very skillfully. My one con is the book feels a little slow. The mystery is introduced around the halfway point, which is a little late, and Sheena doesn\u2019t really get much further than understanding there are unusual spiritual forces interested in her. I wish we\u2019d gotten a fuller picture than that of what was happening before breaking for book two. I\u2019ll read another one because I enjoy the author\u2019s portrayal of Sheena, and hope that more happens in the next entry.A very small niggle that has nothing much to do with the story:A Vow of Purity ceremony (a promise by a young girl to stay chaste before marriage, made to her dad) is mentioned early on and I thought, as I always do: \u201cWhy don\u2019t evangelical boys take the same Vow of Purity to their moms? Isn\u2019t a boy\u2019s purity expected to be just as much a part of his faith as a girl\u2019s is? And what better way to help remind a boy to respect women than by having him make a vow to his mother?\u201d Doubt it will happen, but I really wish those expectations and promises were more balanced. . .",
