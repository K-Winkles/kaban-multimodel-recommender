It also has a good bit of humor, without becoming unbearable, annoying, or otherwise getting in the way of the story. I'm looking forward to the next book.",

In this book there was a little more romance and character back story building with a couple of the girls, and I thought for a second that we may get a sex scene, but I\u2019m not sure if Brandon wants to go there in this series which seems aimed at a younger or anime loving audience.",
