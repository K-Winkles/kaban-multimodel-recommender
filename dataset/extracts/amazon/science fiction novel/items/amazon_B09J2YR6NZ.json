                "reviewText": "The book is set in the Warhammer 40k universe, although it's unclear whether it is an officially sanctioned work. If not, though, it should be. The main character is a young man from a noble family who is marked with arcane symbols after going the wrong way on routine training mission of foxes and hares. There's a great deal of action as he tries to unravel the source of the marks and stay out of trouble with the Church hierarchy. I greatly enjoyed the book, and it's a complete story with sequels rather than a partial book broken into parts.",

                "reviewText": "The story reads more like a spy novel with shifting allegiances and secret motives than it does a sci-fi thriller. Paric reads like a character twice his age with all the decisions he makes and conclusions he draws. He could very well have been James Bond in the underhive, considering all his actions.Much of the story deals with political intrigue and spends a lot of time worldbuilding. This is fine, but sometimes the asides were disruptive to the scene. On one technical note, there were numerous characters whose names were four letters long and started with an L, making them difficult to keep straight.There was action spaced here and there but not as much as other reviews suggested. Many of those scenes were dealt with quick-fire writing, leaving much to the imagination. For example, at one point, Paric grabs a man\u2019s wrist and pulls him down as Paric falls backward and the man is dead by the time he hit the ground. But how did he die? It\u2019s not explained.The story itself was interesting and the world was fleshed out. Though this story wasn\u2019t entirely my cup of tea, I could see others enjoying it more.",

                "reviewText": "I sort of expected a future cybertech world similar to Neuromancer or Blade Runner. I got a heck of a lot more! Tough MC fighting in an aristocratic mega tech future universe fighting against demons, spirits, and all the ugliness of human nature. Super creative universe (too big to call it a world) with all the intrigue and back stabbing of Game of Thrones. Honestly, the Hiveworlds is most reminiscent of Warhammer 40k in flavor. My only fault with this first book is transition between real world and spirit world can be confusing at times. However, it gets easier to understand as you read the 2nd and 3rd books. Everything you could want in a future dystopian universe with a smart MC and action galore. Enjoy!",

                "reviewText": "Still not sure how this has stayed up, the material is a bit too close to other established properties. For whatever it's worth, I like the take here better than most of the established takes. It files off a lot of the dumb edges.Regardless of that, the book is OK. It tries to tell a story about psychic awakening, gang warfare, and noble house intrigue, but the choppy writing and lack of focus on one or two areas holds it back. Mini-exposition dumps break up the flow, as concepts are introduced and the narrator explains them for us at a higher level. It also trips into a bit of wish fulfillment kind of fantasy, the kind of thing you'd find in a YA novel. I can put this down to early writing syndrome, as it looks like the author has a few more books under their belt.I got this for free, and would say it's a fair read based on that.",

                "reviewText": "This is excellelnt sci-fi dystopian fiction and vibes with my favorites as Blade Runner, both book and movie and as book more recognizable as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, and even more closely resembles William Gibson's Neuromancer with a dash of the Matrix thrown in. The writing is consistently crisp and the dialogue is tense and drives the story forward. The hive worlds are situated according to hierarchy and the tech aspect throughout rocks. The main character Paric is the narrator and he's likeable and driven ... though there's much coming at the reader at first. The photos including the cover are all stunning in that noir sci fi dystopiana vibe. Highly recommended and I look forward to reading more of Rory Surtain.",

                "reviewText": "I'm surprised that James hasn't emerged from the depths of his Workshop to declare exterminatus on this book. I mean, I was expecting thinly-disguised fan fiction going in, but the author seemingly forgot the \"thinly-disguised\" part. He doesn't seem to understand that when you do this sort of thing, you are supposed to file off all the identifying marks, but keep the look and feel of the original; instead, he *kept* most of the identifying marks, and changed the look and feel. I mean, seriously: an Emperor kept alive by the sacrifice of thousands, Adeptus Astartes, Adeptus Arbites, an Inquisiton with an Ordo Malleus, the Warp, and much more. He can't possibly think he can get away with this? James ripped off a lot too, so there's some leeway, but there are limits.However, I sincerely hope that James either doesn't notice, or decides to be uncharacteristically lenient. Because this is a good book. Really good. And the changes made to the setting actually work very well, I just don't think they're probably going to be enough to legally distinguish it from its inspiration (not that I'm a lawyer so I hope I'm wrong. But sadly, I doubt I am).So, in conclusion I strongly recommend you get this book. While you still can.",
