                "reviewText": "Okay. I just finished reading Bishop. It actually surprised me. While the beginning had me worried that it was being tailored to \"modern audiences\", once I finished the story I was very surprised that it was a very enjoyable read. There are several callbacks to the movie Aliens, including Alien 3 as well. And funnily enough, there's one quote in the book from a certain individual that is almost a direct quote from the movie Apocalypse Now. So go figure. But what I did like was that while the story was not as cliched that some of the other ones had been previous, this one showed some pretty good character development and a lot of nuance. And there's even a surprise character in it that I was not expecting that was a fun addition and with his character there were some very, very subtle callbacks to one of the two movies I mentioned earlier. It actually made me chuckle out loud. And the character of Bishop was written very well with a lot of care, which was very appreciated. So definitely check this book out, it is not what I expected and I was thoroughly surprised by it. And the ending does leave open quite a few possibilities. Some of which are pretty terrifying for that universe.",

                "reviewText": "The concept of this book had me hooked when I read the blurb. Bishop was one of my favorite characters in Aliens and I wanted to see what happened to him after Alien 3. This story is told from a variety of viewpoints, in audiobook, they are all voiced by different narrators. I think it unfolds better on audio. Sgt Apone's brother mounts an unauthorized mission to rescue Bishop's remains. His turns out not to be the only one. Others are interested in what his brain knows, including Bishop's creator Michael Bishop. Weyland Utani is not the only organization looking to weaponize the Xenomorphs, several other groups as well. We are introduced to a Chinese effort. The story jumps back and forth between viewpoints instead of a straight narration. The first part drags a bit, but my favorites were the Bishop episodes. They really dealt with the creator's motives and Bishop's growing conscience. Needless to say, things happen, it all goes south and who is left standing. Once it gets going, its pretty good.",

I\u2019m just going to say it, Ash in the OG Alien was one of my favourites characters. So a novel based on Bishop one of the franchises most famous synthetics was a lure I couldn\u2019t resist, I was also keen to read this as it mentioned Bishops creator going rogue. In all honesty Michael Bishop proved to be one of the most interesting aspects of the novel, his drives, motivations and megalomania where quite interesting. Maybe its just me but I feel every Alien novel just rehashes the same personalities for the colonial marines, you know the types, orphan with a dark past, macho muscle ape etc etc. I find it a little tedious now. This book had potential to deviate from some of the dross Alien novels we have received before but never quite realises its full potential. In summary some enjoyable parts but felt quite short and rushed.",
