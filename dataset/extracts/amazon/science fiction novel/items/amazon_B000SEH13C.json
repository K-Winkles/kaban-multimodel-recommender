                "reviewText": "I don't want to spend too much time writing a review of what is, in essence, a classic novel. This is my first reading of Cat's Cradle, and my first time reading anything of substantial length by Kurt Vonnegut. The simple reason I don't want to spend too much time reviewing this book is that it has already been reviewed countless times, especially by people far more familiar with it than I am.SPOILER ALERT! This is a short book, and it's almost impossible to avoid spoiling even the ending while trying to discuss significant aspects of the work. Also, this book has been around a while, meaning it's highly unlikely you won't have heard at least a capsule summary of the plot. That said, the following two paragraphs reveal details near the end of the book.There were only two things I found disappointing in the story: First, there was no speculation nor explanation given as to why there would suddenly be purple-mouthed tornadoes all over the place. Perhaps that was just the author's speculation about the knock-on effects of all the Earth's water suddenly converting to ice-nine.Second, there was mention of a strange nimbus (\"lavender corona\") surrounding the \"weird plug\" of rock sitting on the back of Mt. McCabe, and it wasn't clear if this was some strange phenomenon or not; the narrator spoke of his desire to visit this formation, to climb it, but he never reports doing so. It's an unexplored detail, and in such a slender volume, such things make me wish for more.The writing was excellent: literate, trenchant and witty. This is my first foray into Vonnegut, so I have no other points of reference to go by.The Rosetta Books edition of this Kindle e-book seems to fall somewhere between the ultra-cheap e-books (free or $0.99) and the premium e-books (with list prices close to those of the print editions) sold by Amazon -- both in terms of price and in terms of general quality. This edition was mostly decent, but had some typesetting issues with punctuation (wrong type of quote or apostrophe used -- open quote instead of close quote, for instance). Further, there were several cases where it was obvious that the text was obtained using OCR of a print edition, and this manifested frequently as the wrong letter in a word, or a letter like \"m\" being replaced by \"rn.\"I was never unable to determine what was truly meant in any passage, but the handful of flaws in this e-book could be easily corrected.",

                "reviewText": "Full review here on my blog: [...]Synopsis: The narrator John (or Jonah) sets out to write a book about what happened on the day America dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. He starts by looking into the life of one of the inventors of the atomic bomb, Dr. Felix Hoenikker. He begins by writing letters to his family and begins communicating with Hoenikker's youngest son, Newt. While he is investigating this family he discovers that the doctor also invented a substance he called ice-nine. Hoenikker's goal was to figure out a way to solidify mud so US Marines would not have to wade through it in battle. Ice-nine instantly turns all water to ice with a melting temperature of 140 degrees. Each of Hoenikker's three children are now in possession of a small piece of ice-nine. He runs into Newt on a plane while traveling to the island of San Lorenzo and is eventually introduced to the eldest son, Frank. It is though Frank that Jonah assume the roll of President of the island since the current President, \"Papa\" Monzano, is dying of cancer. In order to save himself the suffering of dying a slow and painful death \"Papa\" eats a small amount of the ice-nine, instantly turning himself to ice. As they are moving his body to a funeral pyre, part of him falls into the water and turns the oceans and all water in the world to ice, essentially destroying the world and almost all life with it.My review: I read this book because one of my favorite authors, Michael Bunker, is releasing a fan fiction book based in this \"world\". This book to me was just okay, better than some of the Kurt Vonnegut I have read but I can see why someone would decide to write a fan fiction story based off this book. The possibilities are endless. Only the last few pages actually touch on the world in a post-apocalyptic state after the world has frozen over and all plant and wildlife has been killed off. There are an infinite number of stories that can spread from this point on. I wonder if Kurt wrote a sequel to this story, I would be interested to see his idea of the world after the book ends and his expansion or ideas of the end of the world from this point on. While I have not been a huge fan of Kurt Vonnegut's work, I do feel better that I have experienced his stories for myself and not just from the spoken or written word of others.My rating: 6Pages: 287Author website: [...]",

Maybe the notion of Rochester\u2019s \u201cImperfect enjoyment\u201d suits the emotion this book has delivered. An exquisite and irreversible imperfect enjoyment. I am not the same after reading this. I am now eager to indulge in my brand new vice and read everything Vonnegut ever wrote.",

                "reviewText": "The first sentence in the \u2018Books of Bokonon\u2019 is this: \u201cAll of the true things I am about to tell you are shameless lies,\u201d and that pretty much sets the stage for Vonnegut\u2019s satirical commentary that shifts with uncommon ease between fatalistic and funny.I will quickly note \u2013 without a word of a lie \u2013 that \u2018Cat\u2019s Cradle\u2019 is certainly one of Vonnegut\u2019s best, while just as quickly adding that it is not on par to \u2018Slaughterhouse Five\u201d (IMHO).\u2018Cat\u2019s\u2019 protagonist is a midget, but perhaps the starring role really belongs to adventurer, calypso singer, self-styled theologian, author, and the most beloved \u2013 though everyone professes the opposite \u2013 of all men, Bokonon! Seriously, this is the guy responsible for the best one-liners found throughout the book, like this gem: \u201cWhen I am dead I\u2019m going to forget everything \u2013 and I advise you to do the same.\u201dVonnegut\u2019s voice in this tour de force is Jonah who presents ideas but immediately questions them, almost forcing the reader to follow suit. The range of characters are (and this is typical of KV) in many cases quite bizarre, but strangely all have a way of resonating with the reader.The book's 200 plus-pages are divided into 127 chapters making it a quick and easy read. Vonnegut\u2019s imagination soars free and what it is allowed to create is really quite wonderful.",
