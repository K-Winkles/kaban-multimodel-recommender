On a hunt to redeem her career, she ends up in the quaintly odd town of Pichesham. There she finds mystery among the residents and a strange history begins to unfold. Reading the Bear of Pichesham is a mind bending, dimension hopping journey that travels from the far past to the future - blurs the lines between animals and humans, time and souls. Without spoiling the twists, I would recommend this book to anyone who loves mysteries, non-linear story telling, ancient bears, and questions about our existence.",

I found it a little difficult to keep track of characters and to get my mind around the worlds created by the author, but also very rewarding to do so! I probably missed a few elements earlier on that would have helped, but his only encourages me to read it again. Great imagination has gone into conjuring this tale with all its strange perspectives. Somewhat to my surprise because I didn't think I liked fantasy/sci fi literature, I enjoyed it immensely, perhaps partly because it is so well constructed. It draws you in and leaves you wanting more 300+ pages later.",

I\u2019m a sci-fi and fantasy fan who enjoys the sort of book on the occult that Neil Gaiman might write, rather than that written by Stephen King, and this book matched that set of requirements admirably. The pace is good, almost a little too fast towards the end when I wanted it to go on longer. I found myself quickly caring about the bear and her story, although the other three characters who get caught up with her early on (trying not to create a spoiler here) were a bit less developed. I think the author did that deliberately, but it may just be the bear was so complex a character, and of course the central one, that there was less time to develop the others. Either way, it didn\u2019t spoil my enjoyment of this gripping tale that races through centuries at quite a clip; I just wondered what those three were thinking as the story unfolded! If you enjoyed Good Omens, you\u2019re probably going to enjoy this book.",
