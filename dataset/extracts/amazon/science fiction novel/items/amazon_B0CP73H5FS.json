                "reviewText": "I really like this series. The main characters are believable, relatable and exciting. They are also regular people, not overpowered gimmick characters. While OPMC's have their place and are occasionally good to read, they are distracting in a serious science-fiction series like this. I truly enjoy the Armstrong family, in all its instances.There were some minor copyediting mistakes here and there, but nothing egregious. For instance, when using the acronym DGC for \"Defensive Grid Craft\", the acronym was arbitrarily either \"DGC\" or \"DCG\" several times within the same chapter. An easy mistake to make, for sure, and one that would have to be actively hunted down in editing, as a spellcheck would bypass it completely.",

                "reviewText": "First thing, this book is shorter than the other books. It was not too much shorter, but enough that I was easily able to complete it within a day. Your mileage may vary, but it is something to keep in mind.With all of that said, this book is a great entry into the series and is a great continuation of William's story. There is a good plot who's only sin is that the resolution felt more than a little rushed. The plot peaks and then is resolved within a chapter or two, which kind of makes the buildup a little disappointing. I still enjoyed it, but it wasn't given as much love as the previous books.Overall it is a worthy entry and I cannot wait for the next one.",

                "reviewText": "I really enjoy the connected series' about the Armstrongs by Kal Sprigs, and can't wait for the next installment of the Forsaken Valor series to come out. I think this series is probably best started after the other two, but probably not necessary to do so.The books are engaging, with complex plots and characters, and generally well written with good editing.That said, I'd guess the release of this specific book was a bit rushed. There are several noticeable grammatical/editing errors, more than I recall from the previous books. Still a much lower number of missed edits than the majority of books I read on Kindle unlimited, but unusual for this author.",

                "reviewText": "One of the things I like about this series is the worldbuilding. A fully fleshed out civilisation with complex characters. The empire as I've said in a previous review is a political snakepit where betrayal and relationships are transactional and good people are crushed by the system. In this entry we see the consequences as a admiral goes rogue. Even the most loyal can break if pushed too far. Interesting fleet and fighter tactics which I hope to see in a wider battle in future entries. Will also has some relationship developments.",
