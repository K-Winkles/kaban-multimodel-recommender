                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars The better 'Comet Imperiling Earth' book is \"Lucifer's Hammer\"",
                "reviewText": "I read both books many years ago and was trying to recall what the differences were, so I bought e-versions and read them again.Clarke is a well-established and prolific SciFi writer. His style is straightforward and he doesn't get into florid descriptions. The story moves along smoothly and it was written such that there was no confusion about what was happening at any time, and yet a month or so after reading it, it is difficult for me to describe what occurred. It is like drinking a glass of properly-treated water. It goes down well, but then... try to describe its taste.The story is essentially this: (SPOILERS)A comet is hurtling toward Earth. Robert Singh, who won a race on the moon and was married twice, is on the ship which is going to nudge it from its path. Various setbacks occur. The comet narrowly misses Earth.The story had some distracting elements such as \"Chrislam\", the amalgamation of Islam and Christianity. Clarke himself said he was \"fascinated by God\" but if he knew a little about either Islam and/or Christianity he would have opted for a different hybrid because these two faiths' core beliefs are absolutely incompatible. Christianity believes Jesus is the Son of God, of one being with The Father, born of the virgin Mary. Islam relegates Jesus to the status of a great prophet only, not Divine, because God can not have a son. There's no way to reconcile these differences without gutting each faith and making them both meaningless.If Clark had written that Judaism and Islam combined it would take much less suspension of disbelief, because neither religion believes in the Divinity of Jesus. It's an unforced error. Anyway, the choice to make a hybrid religion was done only so there'd be a joint-\"villain\" to blame for sabotage of the mission against the comet. The story needed fanatics who believed it was God's will to cleanse Earth with a comet.Clark also has a fascination with open marriages and polyamory. I seem to recall reading such description of characters' relationship choices in other books of his. It doesn't explain characters' choices or actions so much as it is just a reflection of what Clarke sees as humanity's future (de)valuation of what the Left calls 'cis-heteronormative' relationships. Characters don't get themselves locked into relationships any longer than utility deems necessary. Individual readers may have feelings about the morality of that but Clark just writes it as a matter-of fact.The better novel of this specific disaster-type is Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle's \"Lucifer's Hammer\". The details provided in this book describe the (co-) discover of the comet's reactions to his discovery, initially dizzy with pride and excitement, then quasi-guilty and horrified. It describes (in pre-internet terms, no less!) the media handling and how people react to the news individually and as groups; how they prepare actively or how they rationalize not doing so. The comet's impact and after-effects are described realistically, meaning that people who might think only of tsunamis and earthquakes and craters (the comet calves) ALSO learn that an ocean impact of this magnitude can send mud from the seafloor up into space, where it freezes as pellets before coming back down and pelting folks with frozen mud bits before all the rain starts.Yes, rain, lots of rain, from all the ocean water thrown upwards, then coming back down. And then there'll be global cooling as Earth's albedo changes, making winter survival tough.That's amid the power outages, widespread destruction of urban centers, looting and the utilization of cannibalism by a warlord to control his troops and subjugate local survivors.Lucifer's Hammer also has religious fanatics who believe God intended the comet to destroy the wickedness of civilization, and their perceived purpose in the post-apocalyptic milieu is to destroy the last-surviving source of electrical power, a nuclear power plant.Hammer of God: ~200pgs. Lucifer's Hammer: ~650 pgs. The latter was more entertaining and was more like a journey instead of a short trip. If you love SciFi, I advise you read them both and make the comparison for yourself.",

Panic-stricken population, scientists working to prevent collision and religious fanatics sure that it is God's will. Colonization of the Moon and Mars, and a World Governing Body are the only differences. It's still a relevant story of astronomy and new discoveries, of the impediment of politics, religion and money, of men and women working against the odds to safeguard mankind and of the courage of which ordinary people are capable.",

Embora com um plot bem diferente, a hist\u00f3ria teve muitas caracter\u00edsticas em comum com \u201cAs fontes do para\u00edso\u201d, do mesmo autor:- o forte tecniqu\u00eas, \u00e0s vezes exaustivo;- a \u201cvirada\u201d em torno dos 70% da hist\u00f3ria, testando nossa paci\u00eancia at\u00e9 l\u00e1;- a preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o com a plausibilidade das leis da f\u00edsica, maior at\u00e9 do que com a dos personagens;- a alfinetada sutil no pensamento religioso, em contrapartida ao cient\u00edfico.Aqui, ao inv\u00e9s de um elevador espacial, o grande projeto do nosso \u201cher\u00f3i\u201d (sempre um homem em posi\u00e7\u00e3o de prest\u00edgio) \u00e9 desviar o curso de um asteroide cuja \u00f3rbita prev\u00ea um encontro catacl\u00edsmico com a Terra.Como no outro romance, a religi\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m amea\u00e7a frustrar os interesses da humanidade pra garantir a \u201csalva\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d das almas, deixando que Deus decida os nossos destinos \u2014 neste caso, uma deusa, j\u00e1 que o asteroide foi batizado com o nome da deidade hindu\u00edsta Kali.Jamais diria que foi uma leitura ruim, mas minha expectativa de uma hist\u00f3ria com mais emo\u00e7\u00e3o do que preciosismo foi frustrada mais uma vez.Por outro lado, adorei as previs\u00f5es do autor sobre o nosso futuro tecnol\u00f3gico e a credibilidade dos dados astron\u00f4micos, o que j\u00e1 era de se esperar desse grande nome do hard SciFi.",

                "reviewText": "Those familiar with Arthur C Clarke's other work will find in The Hammer of God everything that they have come to expect from one of science fiction's definitive authors. In his care over the minute scientific detail of each event he describes, his ability to string together different scenarios into a compelling narrative, and his willingness to explore the ethical complexities posed by humanity's future development, Clarke is unmatched.The Hammer of God depicts the efforts of mankind to avoid destruction by a potentially Earth-shattering asteroid impact. Today, alongside climate change, this is probably our most familiar end-of-the-world scenario, but as Clarke's introductory and concluding remarks in this edition make clear, at the time it was not fully accepted that the dinosaurs had met their end from an asteroid impact, let alone that humanity might do the same. Even for the reader who has seen the world end this way on screen and in written form multiple times, this story feels fresh and frightening. Don't be surprised after reading to find yourself searching the internet to try and work out which of our Solar System's many orbiting fragments is due to crash into us first.Clarke's story is situated in the twenty-second century. Humans have established settlements on the Moon and on Mars, and can travel around the Solar System with comparative ease, but ultimately all are reliant on Earth's more bountiful resources. Our protagonist, scientist Robert Singh, is one those to have ventured into space. In the book's early chapters, we find him running (or bouncing) marathons on the moon, and taking his family to Mars.When the villain of the piece - our asteroid - emerges from near Jupiter and starts to make its way Earthwards, Singh leads the mission to try and deflect it. Here, Clarke is in his element, with rockets, explosives and stoic determination each employed to try and save the Earth. Accidents of humanity - fundamentalism, error - meet with accidents of science - the unpredictability of space - to get in his way, and to make this book tense, gripping, and eerily convincing.It is not a completely flawless work. Clarke is most comfortable as a short story writer, and there are times when parts of this book feel like short pieces strung together rather than one convincing narrative. Singh's marathon exploits and his family life feel at times disconnected from his scientific mission. Nevertheless, these are minor gripes in what is otherwise a must-read for lovers of drama and science fiction alike.",
