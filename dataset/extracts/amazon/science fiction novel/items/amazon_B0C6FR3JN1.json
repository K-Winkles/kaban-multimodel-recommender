And BOY, DID I PICK A DOOZY! \ud83d\ude03I actually discovered this book on an ad in the news, it showed about the spy cats, and the cursing dolphins. When I realized that it was narrated by the famous Will Wheaton, I KNEW I had to try this book\u2026.and it was so worth it! \ud83d\ude04I can\u2019t get into many spoilers, cause I\u2019ll try to leave my reviews as spoiler free as possible. But I can tell you this ( \u26a0\ufe0fSPOILER WARNING\u26a0\ufe0f) : We have our main protagonist, Charlie, that finds out that his Uncle Jake, who was a billionaire that owned parking lots as his business, tragically passed away. He then finds out that it that he wasn\u2019t JUST a very rich park lotting entrepreneur, but was also a \u201cVILLAIN\u201d. His life turns upside down after he discovers that. That\u2019s all I\u2019m gonna give you in spoilers.If my small, brief explanation of this book interest you in any way then I truly recommend that you take some time of your schedules and sit down and give this book a try.John Scalzi,Thank you for such an enjoyable read! It really made my Christmas! I also wanted to thank you the great Will Wheaton for narrating it, and bringing the characters to life.FINAL RATING: \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",

As can be expected from a book about villains, there are murders, mayhem, missile explosions, and even a deadly laser. But the violence almost seems like an afterthought. The focus is on the rather inept hero, Charlie, and his efforts to fill his recently departed uncle\u2019s shoes. As part of the uncle\u2019s villainous machinations, a line of intelligent cats was developed. Along the way, they (with some human assistants) guide Charlie on his path to villainy. I grinned, chuckled, and even laughed out loud at some of the happenings in the book. The rather banal ending has a couple of twists that I didn\u2019t see coming. Should yoiu read it? Yes!!!",

I enjoyed the very convoluted plot with tons of plot twists and turns. The witty dialogue kept a smile on my face for the first 20% of the book. The humble, self deprecating hero was perfect in his role as the hapless stooge, thrown into a network of huge corporate, high tech criminal enterprises upon the death of his uncle. Lots of sophisticated machinations and plots within plots. No spoilers here, but I ended the book with another smile on my face. Enjoy!",

The story was outlandish yet believable even down to the typing intelligent manager cats and the talking dolphins. The mob-like antagonists are hilariously idiotic only because they think they\u2019re smart and somehow get outwitted time and again by someone who died at the beginning of the book. It\u2019s a light read that took me a couple of days and such an excellent book. This is my second Scalizi book, and I plan to read everything he has written. Will Wheaton narrates the audio book, as he did the first Scalzi book I read, and the audio book was perfection. Wheaton is one of my all-time favorite narrators for science fiction and fiction books.",

                "reviewText": "Are you ready for cats who are management, and dolphins who want to unionize? I love John Scalzi's imagination, and Starter Villain is a joy from start to finish.Most people would look at Charlie Fitzer and see a loser. At thirty-two, he's divorced, working as a substitute teacher because journalism is a dying profession, and living with his cat, Hera, in a house he doesn't own. His father left the house in a trust to Charlie and his three successful half-siblings almost a generation older than their younger brother. He hears on the news that his Uncle Jake died, but he hasn't seen the wealthy businessman since he was five. Uncle Jake and Charlie's father had an argument at Charlie's mother's funeral, and that's the last time he saw him. But, it seems Uncle Jake had his eye on Charlie.Mathilda Morrison represents Jake Baldwin when she shows up at Charlie's. She has some odd requests. Would Charlie stand for his uncle at his funeral in town? In return, Jake left everything to Charlie, and the estate will buy Charlie's house from the rest of the estate. It's only at the funeral home that Charlie wonders what Uncle Jake was involved in. He thought he only owned parking garages. But, the floral arrangements have messages saying they're glad Jake is dead, and the mourners are all males in their late 30s and early 40s. One even tries to stab the corpse to prove Jake is dead. Charlie doesn't understand at all, and he's even more confused when he returns home just in time to see his house blow up.Morrison will handle all Charlie's difficulties. She sweeps him off to Saint Genevieve in the southern Caribbean. It seems Uncle Jake owned the entire island. He owned more than parking garages. He was a villain who offered countries and other businessmen opportunities to compete against each other. Now, it's all Charlie's. He knows nothing about the villain business, and he's too empathetic and kindhearted. But, he easily learns to listen and be ruthless when he's invited to a convocation of villains. He needs all the help he can get from Morrison and Charlie's cat, Hera. It seems Hera is sentient, can type, and owns real estate. She's been watching over Charlie all this time he thought he provided a home for a stray.While some readers might find all their conspiracy theories confirmed in Starter Villain, I thought it was funny and slightly believable. I love the cats and the dolphins who are planning to go on strike. And, Charlie. Charlie is a nice guy caught up in an unbelievable world. If you read and enjoyed Scalzi's The Kaiju Preservation Society, you should enjoy this one.Oh, and the cats. John Scalzi's cats are well-known on his blog. This book is dedicated to \"Sugar, Spice, and Smudge, my current set of cats. You are a real pain in my ass, and I love your stupid fuzzy faces\".",

It's not profound literature, just fun. And Hera deserves more attention :)",

                "reviewText": "Five stars on account of the cats, which I am sure was Scalzis plan all along.A thoroughly entertaining, if short, read with quite a satisfying ending.Like many of his other books there's a lot of humour in this one. All of the characters, even those, like the hero, who don't habitually shoot people, throw them to the sharks or attempt to drown them in molten lava approach such activities with the kind of dry, wise cracking humour that probably wouldn't be exhibited in real life.An out of work journalist come supply teacher finds his life turned upside down following the death of his estranged uncle. He swaps a mediocre solitary existence with just his cat for company for a life populated by men called \"Tobias the Stabber\", not so secret high tech lairs on volcanic islands, secret cabals of global super villains and surprising revelations about his cat.Why would want to read this book ? Why wouldn't you. It's short so it won't take long and it's exciting, warm and amusing with an ending that will leave you feeling happier than you felt when you started the book.",
