The ending, a weak, quickie solution to what was a very serious dilemma. The Epilogue kind of made the end worthwhile. I did buy all 3 of the books and have to admit that book 2 is bordering on just plain silly. I'm kind of just scrolling though it. Then, there's book 3.",

                "reviewText": "First off, I just want to say that I am giving this book 5 stars for a variety of reasons. I enjoy most time travel books. Also, although I don\u2019t think this one is technically self-published, it\u2019s definitely self-published adjacent. Those two facts give the book a higher starting point than it would otherwise, and it is good enough to retain a 5 star rating. However, the most salient part of the review might be this: this is the first book of a series, but I don\u2019t know if I want to read the next one.I liked the way this book handles time travel conceptually, but I think that other reviewers have correctly pointed out that it doesn\u2019t really make any sense. Without getting into the details too much, the book makes it pretty clear that Aideen is on the island by herself for about fifty years and has participated in many (up to 180 or so) missions in that time. But they never explain who was sending the travelers to her, or acknowledge that inconsistency. Key parts of the book also center around what exactly happens when changes are made in the past, and who notices the changes. But at the end, two very important plot points rely on two very different things happening in such a case (in one case, the future changes immediately and only the travelers notice; in the other, things hadn\u2019t changed yet, but would soon in a noticeable way for everyone).Finally, I wanted to point out something I found funny. The book takes place in Ireland, and we meet several Irish women with traditional Irish names. There are several times in the book where Dani meets a woman, and then the woman says something like, \u201cMy name is Aoife. It\u2019s a strange name I know. It\u2019s spelled \u2018Aoife\u2019 but it\u2019s pronounced \u2018Ee-fa\u2019.\u201d I\u2019m sure it\u2019s helpful for readers who are unfamiliar with the names, but the dialog comes across as very unnatural. I would prefer a glossary or pronunciation guide at the beginning of the book or even a footnote. Or just give the women easier to pronounce names.",

                "reviewText": "The author seems like a likable fellow and I always feel bad when giving a harsh review that might get back to the author and make him unhappy. But, I also want to be honest about the book. Time travel is a very competitive subject these days and there is loads of material out there in the form of books, series and films. A few are excellent; some just run of the mill and some awful. I find this story falls into the middle group. There is nothing in the story that makes it stand out. It is not very clever, funny and there are quite a few plot holes. It is apparent that science is not a strong point with the author and it shows in the story. This story reads more like a world travel vacation than science fiction. The whole time travel theme seems to be inserted as an afterthought. The story is more about the relationship between the two girls and what they see. Also, if one is going to tackle time travel, there needs to be a strong passion and research into history. Only going back to the 70\u2019s just does not cut it no matter how you explain it into the story. One does not have to do time travel to write an acceptable story about the past and present. Without a strong background in history and science this author needs to rethink what he will write about.",
