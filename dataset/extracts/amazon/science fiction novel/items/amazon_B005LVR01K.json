There are no elections, no interviews, no prerequisites whatsoever\u2014it all comes down to the random turns of a giant wheel. But when a new Quizmaster takes over, the old one still keeps some rights, namely the right to hire an unending stream of assassins to attempt to kill the new leader.In the wake of the most recent change in leadership, employees of the former ruler scurry to find an assassin who can get past telepathic guards. But when one employee switches sides, troubling facts about the lottery system come to light, and it just might not be possible for anyone to win.\u201cBuilt up with the detail of a Heinlein and the satire of a Kornbluth.\u201d\u2014Anthony Boucher, author of The Case of the Crumpled Knave",

This book was no exception. The writing isn't the greatest, but it moves along at a quick pace, and introduces a lot of the \"psi-fi\" elements that play prominent roles in his later writings. I would recommend it for people like me who read all things PKD, or for anyone looking for some interesting ideas in the form of a fun read.",

                "reviewText": "Philip K Dick's Solar Lottery is a rather intrguing, but ultimately weak tale of the future devolving into randomness with an emphasis on entertainment value. The Quizmaster is the head of the world government, but is chosen at random. At that point an assassin is also selected to attempt to kill the Quizmaster in a sort of reality TV show. The Quizmaster is protected by telepaths. What follows is a former Quizmaster tries to rig the system by using an android assassin controlled by various humans who have sworn fealty. What ensues is a farcical escapade with one of his minions killing the mind crew and eventually ending up as Quizmaster himself.The story has a tongue in cheek perspective in which Dick was overdoing the almost irrelevance of government as other than entertainment value for the masses. The side story of a tenth world and the search for it seemed like another story that was never fully matured.",

But the flow of unexpected ideas and the vividness of their rendering is great stuff. He is working to do the same thing here that he did so well later - complex, multi-threaded stories full of ideas and humor - and he does do that here, with the same high level of ambition that he maintained through his career. It's not a classic, it has flaws, but it's a fine piece of work.",

                "reviewText": "\"The operating principle was random selection: positions of public power were decided by a sophisticated lottery. Everyone had a chance, everyone could live in hope that they would be chosen to be the boss, the Quizmaster. But with the power came the game - the assassination game - which everyone could watch on TV. Would the new man be good enough to avoid his chosen killer? Which made for fascinating and exciting viewing, compelling enough to distract the public's attention while the Big Five industrial complexes run the world, the solar system and the people, unnoticed and completely unopposed. Then, in 2203, with the choice of a member of a maverick cult as Quizmaster, the system developed a little hitch...\"-- from the back coverWritten in 1954 and published in 1955, Solar Lottery was Philip K Dick's first published novel. It introduces a number of themes which he continued to explore throughout his career.As with all PKD's works this novel makes you marvel at his imagination but also (if you are of a philosophical turn of mind) brings you to question and consider the themes he raises for yourself. PKD also creates characters that I at least find believable.\"[Dick] sees all the sparkling and terrifying possibilities. . . that other authors shy away from.\"--Paul Williams, Rolling Stone\"Philip Dick does not lead his critics an easy life, since he does not so much play the part of a guide through his phantasmagoric worlds as give the impression of one lost in their labyrinth.\"-- Stanislaw Lem, \"Philip K. Dick: A Visionary Among the Charlatans\"If you are new to Philip K Dick's work I would also recommend the following novels (which generally seem to be regarded as among his best): The Man In The High Castle (S.F. Masterworks) Ubik (S.F. Masterworks) A Scanner Darkly (S.F. Masterworks) Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said (S.F. Masterworks) Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep? (S.F. Masterworks) That said, though some of PKD's works are better than others, to my mind they are all well worth reading. I would also recommend his short story collections: Beyond Lies The Wub: Volume One Of The Collected Short Stories Second Variety: Volume Two Of The Collected Short Stories The Father-Thing: Volume Three Of The Collected Short Stories Minority Report: Volume Four Of The Collected Short Stories We Can Remember It For You Wholesale: Volume Five of The Collected Short Stories",
