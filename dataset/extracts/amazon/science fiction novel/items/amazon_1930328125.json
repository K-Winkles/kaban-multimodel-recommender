                "reviewText": "Babble \u2013 Book 1I did pre-order this book, and then received a pre-release copy from the author in exchange for an honest review. My review is based on the pre-release copy.Overall, I would have to give this a rating of 4.7 out of 5 stars.I sank into the story right away. I disliked having to put the story down after lunch break was over or to actually get a few hours of sleep before having to work in the morning.There were only a handful of instances where I noticed a wrong word or an apostrophe-s instead of just the single s on the end of a plural word. (One instance nearing the end was let\u2019s instead of lets.) Beginning or end quote marks were missing from dialogue sections maybe seven or eight times that I noticed. And there was one instance about 27% of the way through where the wrong character name was used in an action.I did have an issue sometimes knowing when the point of view changed between characters, but I discovered it\u2019s because the large font size that I have to use prevented me from seeing the multiple line spaces between those sections. When I changed the font size smaller close to normal settings, I saw the adequate spacing. So this issue did not count against my rating, but it could be an issue for others who also have to use one of the large font sizes.One item that definitely affected my final rating and sticks in my mind is the character of Arnez. He starts out feeling like an older frat-boy who is in a boring government job. And then he suddenly turns nasty and rude, and then flip-flops for a fair part of the story. I got thrown out of the story a few times as he\u2019d pendulum shift.Even with those few issues, I still greatly enjoyed the story. And since the name (inside the book) indicates that it is book one in a series, I will pay close attention to the author\u2019s newsletter for the next installments. ~grin~",

As the story unfolds, we find out that Bobbie has a very unusual way of speaking, and a peculiar obsession with building towers. Is it the gift of tongues? Autism? Something else? Whatever it is, a lot of people are interested. A medical institution. A charismatic church. Bobbie\u2019s former husband. Homeland Security. And Angie is trying to protect Bobbie from all of them.After a decade on the run, everyone seems to be closing in on them. Bobbie is sixteen and his mom is determined to stay a step ahead while they travel to a mysterious place in West Virginia. Part action adventure, sci-fi, visionary, and mystery, the story provides plenty of character and action. It asks interesting, philosophical questions about humanity\u2019s potential for evolution, and the Earth\u2019s divine relation to the cosmos.",

Having said that, here is my honest opinion and review of this book. I like this story. The plot is rather unique and not similar to anything that I can recall ever reading before. Is has plenty of interesting twists and turns to keep you guessing where the story goes next. A child and his mother following a path to Destiny that can only be picked up intuitively. Each of the characters is well developed and has his or her role well thought out along with their motivations. The development over the course of the story is well balanced with the information needed arriving just when it is needed. This strange future world is well constructed and plays out very convincingly. The writing is good and easy to read while the pace of the story builds well until the climax. All in all a very good read and well worth the time to read it. I am looking forward to the sequel.",

                "reviewText": "Angela and Brian Cagle were happy. An unlikely match, they had worked hard to make their marriage work, and when Bobbie was born, their happiness just expanded.As Bobbie grows, he begins to exhibit some unusual traits. As an infant and toddler, he doesn\u2019t develop speech as expected but babbles in an extraordinary way that the members of the Cagles\u2019 charismatic church family claim is \u201cspeaking in tongues.\u201d But the babbling doesn\u2019t fit the known patterns for it to be glossolalia. Too, the boy doesn\u2019t engage with others at all but has spells that come over him in which he repeatedly builds towers out of bits and pieces he finds at hand.Against Brian\u2019s wishes, Angie takes the boy to the nearby university medical research hospital to try and determine why their son is the way his is. But when Homeland Security takes an inexplicable interest in Bobbie, too, Angela grabs the boy and flees leaving Brian and everyone she knows and loves behind.Now, after a decade on the run, they are closing in and Bobbie\u2019s father is with them. As Bobbie approaches his sixteenth birthday, things are starting to come together, leading them to a mysterious location in the West Virginia mountains.This story is definitely not over! The action was fast and tense and as much as Angie is in the dark about what is going on with her son, the reader is as well. Is the human race ready to evolve to a new level? Are aliens guiding our development? Is it God\u2019s plan? The story is well written, entertaining, and fresh. Recommended for a variety of readers because this is a thriller, a mystery, and an epic scifi tale!",
