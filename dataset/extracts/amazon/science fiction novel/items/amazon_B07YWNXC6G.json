                "reviewText": "If half stars were available, I'd go to 3.5 because this light-hearted romp made me smile and made an enjoyable escape from the slings and arrows of outrageous all that stuff. It bounces along with some clever ideas and droll plot points. Where it fails is in characterization. The personalities and speech styles of most characters are almost interchangeable and much of their motivation is shallow or vague. That matters little if you're just riding along for the jokes, but it does keep the book from rising to the level of deeper SF/F humor. I have no complaints about buying this book and certainly wouldn't discourage anyone else from doing the same.",

Note to self \"don't buy bundled trilogies without reading a good chunk of the first book\". The second and third books were progressively weaker and I was glad to finish them.",
