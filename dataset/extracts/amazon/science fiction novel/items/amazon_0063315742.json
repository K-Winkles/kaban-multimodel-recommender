        "description": "\u201cShort stories have to accomplish a nearly impossible magic trick: to introduce a world often much stranger than our own and make you care about it in a matter of pages,\u201d writes R. F. Kuang in her introduction. \u201cThe most important part of this magic trick is just a willingness to get weird.\u201d The stories in The Best American Science Fiction and Fantasy 2023 are brimming with bizarre and otherworldly premises. Women can\u2019t lie or fall in love. Fathers feed their children ghost preserves. Souls chase one another through animal incarnations. Yet these stories are grounded deeply in our reality. Out of these stories\u2019 weirdness emerges the cruelty of border enforcement, the horror of legislation restricting reproductive freedom, the frightening pace of AI. The result is a stunning, immersive, intensely felt experience, showing us less of what the world is, and more of what it could be.The Best American Science Fiction and Fantasy 2023 includes Nathan Ballingrud \u2022 KT Bryski \u2022 Isabel Ca\u00f1as \u2022 Maria Dong \u2022 Kim Fu \u2022 Theodora Goss \u2022 Alix E.

Anthologies are always hard to rate, but this is one of those occasions where I need to round up to 5\u2b50\ufe0fbecause almost every story completely grabbed me. I love speculative short stories because authors are always finding new ways of being weird and somehow making us believe that this weirdness has logic, and this collection is not short in great (weird) realities.
