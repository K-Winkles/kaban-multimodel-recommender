                "reviewText": "I loved Ringworld when I read it 35 years ago. It allowed me access to the wonderful world of Larry Niven's Known Space. And I devoured every book I could and purchased every new one that came out. Last ones dealing with the Puppeteer Worlds migration.So when I saw this was coming out as a graphic novel, I was excited. Like another reviewer, I enjoy graphic novels and expected the magnificent world of Louis Wu to translate into colors and images that met my expectations from 30+ years ago. They way Niven describes Louis and Teela's cosmetic alterations, the Kzinti's' magnificence, the majesty of the Puppeteer home world.All muted in black and white cartoons. No depth. No majesty. No translation of those feelings of grandeur. Remember the description of the Arch as they traveled? The colors they saw from their flycycles? Nothing. Details lost in a poor adaptation of a great novel. I'm sorry but as a long time fan of Niven's tales, I find this graphic novel adaptation to be a HUGE letdown in so many ways. Color and depth of detail are needed for this novel. Shame on the editors for letting this go to print.",

                "reviewText": "First off I knew I was getting a graphic novel not the original book as it seems that most peoples complaints are that is is not the original book....read the title people.Personally I enjoyed this adaptation of the story, it's been a long time since I read the original and didn't expect it to to match my memories perfectly just like a movie is never the same as a book. Still thought it carried the story-line well and I look forward to the next issue.I read it on my Tablet so I had a larger screen than an e reader still i had to use the enlarged version (double tap) that goes frame by frame on the page so I could clearly read the words, but that would be my old eyes.Now Spoiler alertAnd for those who know the story, part 1 ends with the sunflower attack on Speaker",

Auf der IMDB gibt es zwar einen Eintrag, dass eine Mini-Serie in Planung ist, aber keine weiteren Details. Also zur Graphic Novel: An der Handlung wurde zum Gl\u00fcck kaum etwas ver\u00e4ndert, abgesehen von diversen K\u00fcrzungen. Leider l\u00e4sst sich aufgrund der eher Storyboard-Qualit\u00e4t nicht die Grandeur der Ringwelt vermitteln. Da hatte ich bei den Romanen ganz andere Bilder im Kopf. Sollte es tats\u00e4chlich zu einer Verfilmung kommen, bleibt zu hoffen, dass die CGI-K\u00fcnstler sich nicht nach dieser Graphic Novel richten.",

                "reviewText": "I was really excited to see one of my favorite novels in comic book form, but when I received my copy I was extremely disappointed in both the art and the dialogue.The art style is an odd mix of cartoonism and realism, and I would have been fine with either had the artist been consistent with tier chosen style rather than picking and choosing what gets to be cartoony and what deserves realism. Another thing that really bothered me about the art is the lack of environmental detail, particularly on the Ringworld itself. The novel is really about exploring the Ringworld, and experiencing awe in the face of such richness and diversity. But all of that has been stripped away for this graphic novel. Only major landmarks get any significant attention, and the majority of the landscapes that are visible are dull and generic, if they're there at all(frequently backgrounds consist of just white space). Nothing breathtaking at all.As for the dialogue...I'm not really sure what I was expecting, considering the limitations of a graphic novel format. But the dialogue is truly awful. Very important details have been eliminated completely, which will confuse anyone who hasn't read the novel, and groundbreaking discoveries are often mentioned off-hand without any discussion leading up to them as if every answer is obvious and every character knows everything. Every conversation feels forced and unnatural.I definitely would not recommend this to anyone. Stick with the original novels.",
