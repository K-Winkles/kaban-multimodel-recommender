The writer, Rick Remender, is probably one of my favorites, he has a way of making something appear predictable and then adds a unique flare of imagination and makes it unpredictable. At first one might think this is just another Sliders, but in comic form, it is not. Anyone who loves comics should pick up this book. The creative team on this book work perfect together to create an amazing read.",
