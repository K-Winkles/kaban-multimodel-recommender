While I've read and enjoyed the creators' other graphic novel, \"Teen Titans: Raven\", I honestly believe that Gar got more characterization and love put into him than his future teammate. I'm glad that the author decided to discuss body image in boys, as that's rarely discussed in YA.You can tell that the writing style is meant for lower level readers, much like \"Raven.\" It's very easy to understand and follow. I will probably always love Gabriel Picolo's art, as I've been following him for years and will continue to do so.A solid read for newbies and veterans of DC Comics.",
