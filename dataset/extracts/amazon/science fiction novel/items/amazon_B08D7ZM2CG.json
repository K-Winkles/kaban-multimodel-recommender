                "reviewText": "Dead Shock is ferociously dark tale of the things that go bump in the night, turned up to 11! I absolutely loved this novel! It reminded me of some of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced in any medium, particularly that unmitigated champion of terror in space\u2014for me, anyway\u2014the deliciously frightening PC game, Dead Space. And Dead Shock brings all those marvelous memories pouring back and adds plenty of its own new ones, as well. This is simply one very scary novel!But even the greatest tale of horror in space (my favorite genre within a genre) would be just okay without the requisite amount of skill in prose, narrative and character development to make it all come to life in a plausible, convincing way. Mr. Henry delivers beautifully here too. His characters are believable and lifelike; some honorable, likable and pleasing, others selfish, repulsive and disgusting\u2014just like in life. His descriptions and writing style are similarly excellent and his insights into human nature really make the suspension of disbelief so much easier.If you\u2019re into space horror and love a well-constructed and terrifying story that lets you go traipsing through some of the most hellacious places you\u2019ve never been with abominations that are guaranteed to send a chill up and down your spine, then you couldn\u2019t do better that to give this masterpiece of horror in space a try.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not sure why people are put off by a cliffhanger in this novel. I figured a cliffhanger would happen based on this book being the first in the series. My biggest gripe is the editing could be tighter. Between some wrong word choices and minor typos, I removed one star. These issues weren't enough to take me out of the story or ruin my experience.Admittedly, I'm not a fan of the doctor, Coulson. He appears a little too forced. Think like Dr. McCoy on Star Trek, but times 100. He has an abrasive attitude and no real reason he acts that way. But maybe that's what Wallace Henry was shooting for.But, that's just my taste in characters and in no way ruins the story.Just a heads up, it gets fairly graphic. And sometimes, it gets a little bizarre, especially with the eclectic mix of aliens and monsters.Brief plot overview: A diplomat for a government-run organization checks on a massive space station holding an entire country's worth of people. When the space station goes radio silent, the diplomat has to take a team in to find out the issue. They arrive to find the place overrun by weird space mutants, piles of dead bodies, and a phantom dictatorship that created a cult-like atmosphere.I'm already in the second book and can safely say business really picks up. Looking forward to finishing out the series.",

The main character isn't all that likeable and seems to zone out whenever there is a fight. I'm interested to see what happens to him in the next book. There's a few editing errors. There's also several times where the author just seems to ignore certain characters. One character just seems to appear every so often when she's needed for a conversation. She's with the group but hardly ever mentioned. There's a group of new characters towards the end, but only one of them is described. Once a fight starts, they aren't mentioned at all. I'm not sure if this was a first draft or there was a ton of stuff cut out, but it just seems like some needed background info or other sentences are missing.",
