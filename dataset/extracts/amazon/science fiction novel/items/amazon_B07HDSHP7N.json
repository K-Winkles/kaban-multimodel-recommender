                "reviewText": "Sigh... I wanted to like this book. Writing style is good, the premise of some kind of \"memory virus\" was really interesting to me... butSPOILERS AHEAD...it really just becomes a time travel thing. 12 monkeys / groundhogs day (30 years) kinda jam. Scientist invents some chair with half baked science stuff with a good heart, but it ends up allowing people to go back in time an change things... but then at a time-point, everyone gets the memories from the alternate time lines. So peoples brains get jammed with multiple timelines of memories.Eventually the tech intended for good gets used for bad and this sets our protagonist(s ?) on a 30 year groundhogs day thing to try and fix it.There's always so many holes you can poke in time travel stuff though. Why does she always wait till its basically the apocalypse and her skin is melting off before almost just barely making the jump back one more time? I mean, she knows its coming - she literally knows the future point - so why not jump back like... a day before the apocalypse? Save some melting skin?Also at a certain point, she knows so much about the world she should just like, I dunno, take it over in that 30 years through wealth and basically knowing everything about the future. That's one way to prevent stereotypical American enemy countries from attacking. Just... take em over? I'm sure there's a way.This groundhogs day thing that is bugging me is only like, the last 5th of the book. Before that it's separated in to somewhat disjointed other parts that feel all over the map.So for me, the logline, the premise pitched for the book is better than what it actually is. It is short and competency written though, so if you are the type that just likes action/sci-fi stuff with little regard for logic, it might be a fun read!",

The author then takes us to a world of diverse and surprising consequences, in a mix of thriller and sci-fi that will keep you on the edge of your seat. 4.5 stars.",

Now leave me alone, it's 3:28 AM and I'm writing a review. Damn.",

                "reviewText": "Having just finished 'Dark Matter', I was unsure whether to buy 'Recursion', as some of the reviews were a bit negative. I'm glad to say I ignored the critics - this book was amazing. It's another rollercoaster ride though time, space, regret and vengeance. OK, there are some challenging ideas about our relevance to 'time' and 'memory', and for sure there are parallels with 'Dark Matter', but this is unique enough to keep you guessing, and the overall storyline is somehow mad and totally convincing at the same time.I really like Blake Crouch's attention to small details - descriptions of falling into stuff, and memories about trivia that I really equate with. And I disagree that there is too much repetition of scenarios. The whole idea of revisiting situations and attempting to put things right demands that. The whole idea of revisiting situations and attempting to put things right demands that.OK. I found it difficult to follow the constantly changing datelines of chapters when reading this on a Kindle on the U-Bahn (it's not so easy to flick back through the pages, right?) and there were some slightly confusing junctures earlier on in the book, but I soon got into the flow of this book during my commute. Still - I would recommend reading this book in as short a timeframe as possible, so you can easily follow the shifting decades and narratives.While the underlying principle of this book is thankfully impossible, the nihilistic consequences of the technology described by Crouch are totally believable, and for that reason, I give this book a big thumbs up. Nice one!",
