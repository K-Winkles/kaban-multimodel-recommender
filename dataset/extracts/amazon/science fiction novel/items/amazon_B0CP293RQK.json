                "reviewText": "\"Dream State\" emerges as a compelling exploration into the fabric of our desires and the lengths we might go to alter reality. Avraham Halili sets the stage for a profound dialogue on human ambition and the ethical boundaries of technological advancement, using the backdrop of a world dominated by mega-corporations and AI. This novel invites readers into a thought experiment: What if our dreams could be more than just ephemeral visions of the night?The narrative, centered around Eric Chapman and Terry, delves into themes of liberation from societal constraints and the pursuit of an egalitarian world. Their journey is not just a series of daring heists but a reflection on the human condition, questioning the very essence of power and greed. Halili's storytelling shines in its ability to intertwine these philosophical musings with a fast-paced narrative, though at times, the depth of character development and exploration of the dream-manifesting abilities feels secondary to the plot's advancement.A point of mild critique lies in the novel's rapid unfolding of events, which, while keeping the reader engaged, occasionally glosses over the potential for deeper introspection into the characters' inner worlds and the moral complexities of their actions. The concept of using dream-like powers in reality is ripe for exploration, and a more measured pace could allow for a richer examination of the consequences and ethical dilemmas that such abilities entail.",
