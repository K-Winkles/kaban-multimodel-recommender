I\u2019ve never been wanted to be a graphic reader, and I will tell you that on the first book, it took me a few pages in to pay attention to the graphic in order to understand and read, this as a graphic novel.I absolutely love the book. I do believe this will be a collectors edition set at the end of the day. And for me, it\u2019s the nostalgia, the fact of who wrote it, and wrote it and note that it or and it has been discussed, that it would be a movie in the future. I do know there are talks to make it happen with Keanu Reeves.I can\u2019t wait to get all 12 additions. I highly recommend this if you\u2019re a comic book person and a person that loves to re-graphic novels and even if you\u2019re not, you should check this out.",

As a devoted fan, this marks my third addition to the series, and I'll undoubtedly be snagging every future release.Despite being in paperback, the quality is outstanding. The pages feel sturdy and the print is crisp, ensuring an enjoyable reading experience.This graphic novel series isn't for the faint of heart. If you revel in violence and appreciate the artistry of a well-executed graphic novel, this is an absolute must-buy. However, I strongly recommend starting from volume one to fully immerse yourself in the BRZRKR universe.Additionally, the anticipation for the film adaptation is palpable. It's bound to be an epic visual journey that fans won't want to miss. BRZRKR is a stellar addition to any graphic novel collection and a thrilling ride from start to finish!",
