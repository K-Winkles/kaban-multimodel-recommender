                "reviewText": "He was Andrew Martin famous Cambridge mathematician who was taken away by the \u201chosts\u201d and replaced by an alien version of Andrew Martin. The aliens were brilliant but had no idea how to make the exchange without drawing attention, as in clothes for the alien imposter would have made his transition far less complicated. Andrew\u2019s wife Isobel simply said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d and cared for him at home. Meanwhile the alien Martin was supposed to dispose of research and kill anyone who had knowledge of it including Martin\u201ds wife and son.So many complications the Vonndarians (or some name very similar) hadn\u2019t considered, one being that human life was interesting enough to want to watch, and in some ways very compelling. The new Andrew Martin liked his new family and did not wish to end them.Did you ever notice that people come to a different country and discover wonderful things that the people who live there take for granted? There\u2019s a lot of discoveries of human life that we take for granted that a new human might find richly rewarding and it\u2019s both poignant and sometimes funny.This was one of the most different and interesting books I have read in along time, and maybe we all need to appreciate the joys of being human a little more. Five stars for great writing and excellent creativity. I loved it!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Maths to kill for",
                "reviewText": "All visible objects, man, are but as pasteboard masks. But in each event--in the living act, the undoubted deed - there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask. If man will strike, strike through the mask! Herman MelvilleFirst off, let me say that I kind of liked the book. It was a sweet (if slightly sappy) love story about a godlike creature from beyond the stars that gave up immortality for love \u2013 the love of a woman, the love of the \u201cfinite spaces\u201d that make up the story. A little like City of Angels\u2026But what truly ignited my interest was in the afterward. The author says he got the idea for the book during a period in his life punctuated by anxiety attacks. These \u201cspells\u201d are characterized by a sense of unreality, dissociation and a whole host of physical symptoms. But what really makes these episodes \u201cspecial\u201d is the unrelenting perception of a meaningless universe.We\u2019ve all heard about the ravages of bipolar disorder or the crippling effects of schizophrenia. But in panic disorder, one looks at the world through a telescope backwards. You see everything projected in your eye in all its tininess and everything means nothing. You are a dust speck looking out on an infinite, meaningless space. There\u2019s no value, no \u201creasoning thing\u201d \u2013 good or evil \u2013 that lies behind that pasteboard fa\u00e7ade.But the book asserts otherwise. It takes the position of the Melville quote. The main character breaks through the fa\u00e7ade of time and distance to find \u201cthe reasoning thing.\u201d And that was apparently love, family and a sense of belonging. Perhaps that was the author\u2019s wish, to live in such a world.The issue of mathematical truth plays an interesting counterpoint to this position. The main character was sent to earth to erase all traces of a proof of the Riemann hypothesis developed by a Cambridge mathematician. The idea is that the proof could unlock a torrent of scientific advancement that would propel an an immature, violent species into the stars sowing havoc along the way. So the proof had to be erased, and the man and his family as well.Anyone who has worked in abstract mathematics knows its utter sterility. Are we really amazed to learn that there is some order to the placement of primes on the real number line? Think about the proof of the irrationality of the square root of two. Assertion that the root is rational leads to a fatal contradiction in the nature of reality. Is this meaning? It gets worse in physics, where the delusion of reality becomes broadened. According to the \u201cStandard Model\u201d the meaninglessness of phase in a wave function satisfying the quantum mechanical wave equation \u201crequires\u201d the existence of photons. But the thing of it is this. Photons exist, whether or not we know what necessity propels them into existence. If Einstein hadn't realized the equivalence of mass and energy, we'd still have atomic bombs - remember the Curies, Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner? The building blocks of destruction are at hand. We just have to pick them up and put them together.So the universe evolves out of necessities beyond human meaning, beyond human feeling. Is that the knowledge that drove Riemann, Cantor and their colleagues to madness? Probably not. More than likely, it was the necessity to concentrate so hard with such focus that something just snapped. Or, just maybe, people drawn to that line of work are, by nature, prone to panic disorder or have self-destructive tendencies to begin with.In any event, the book paints an alternate universe in which love and community are possible (though not assured.) Is this a fantasy, a pasteboard mask? I guess we all just have to puzzle that one out for ourselves. But if you look at it at this angle, the book transcends its somewhat worn plot line. It was worth the read.",
