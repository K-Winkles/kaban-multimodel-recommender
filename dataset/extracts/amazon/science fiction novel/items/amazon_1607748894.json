                "reviewText": "Story Genius is the latest book from Lisa Cron, author of Wired for Story. In Story Genius, Cron takes the basic concept from Wired for Story (that, as humans, we are wired to read stories and listen to them as a way of learning about the world and understanding how other people think). It takes elements of Debra Dixon\u2019s GMC theory, and adds in a plotting methodology similar to the method Jack Bickham outlines in Scene and Structure.No, this is not a book for confirmed pantsters \u2026 although it might prompt pantsters to question whether they might actually need to cross over to the dark side and become a plotter. Although Cron isn\u2019t a fan of traditional plotting:Plotters have it backward: the events in the plot must be specifically created to force the protagonist to make a specific really hard internal change. And that means you need to know, specifically, what that internal change will be before you begin creating a plot.I suspect some novelists (pantsters, perhaps) don\u2019t do this, because I\u2019ve certainly read novels where the end didn\u2019t make sense in the light of the information provided. I also suspect some novelists (definitely plotters) take this overboard, as I\u2019ve also read novels where the external situation was too obviously contrived to bring around the inner change, to the point the external situation didn\u2019t make sense.To misquote Yoda, there has to be a balance. Lisa Cron starts by practicing what she preaches: she hooks us with a story. In this case, she refers to those times she/you/I stayed up far too late at night, reading \u2018just one more chapter\u2019 until we reached the final page \u2026 probably at the same time as the birds woke up to welcome the new day.(At the risk of sounding judgemental, if you\u2019re an aspiring fiction author and you\u2019ve never said \u2018just one more chapter\u2019 or stayed up far too late reading, you either don\u2019t read enough fiction, or you\u2019re lying. I\u2019d prefer you were lying.)The most useful part of Story Genius for me was the discussion about plot vs. story. I\u2019ve read other books which talk about plot being the all-important element of fiction, with comments like this:Before there was plot there was story. Story was the narration of events in the sequence that they happened. Plot is story that has a pattern of action and reaction. Plot is more than just a chronicle of events. The listener asks a different question: \u201cWhy does this happen?\u201dRonald B Tobias,20 Master Plots and How to Build ThemInstead of the either/or nature of plot and story, Lisa Cron\u2019s view is that plot and story are intertwined:Story is about the internal struggle. It\u2019s about what the protagonist has to learn, to overcome, to deal with internally in order to solve the problem that the external plot poses.(see the GMC connection?). Cron also says:Here\u2019s the real truth: your novel itself beings \u201cin the middle of the thing\u201d [aka in media res]\u2014the \u201cthing\u201d being the story. What starts on page one is the second half of the story, where the plot kicks in.\u201dI don\u2019t know about you, but reading that was a lightbulb moment for me, as was this:The story and the plot are two very different things. The story comes first, and is born of one person, and one person only: the protagonist. Everyone and everything else will be created to serve his or her story.After explaining her methodology, Cron applies it to a real-life manuscript from volunteer/victim Jennie Nash, novelist, book coach and partner in Author Accelerator (yes, Jennie and Lisa offer Story Genius as an online course as well).This is alternately fascinating and frustrating: fascinating to see the way a writer works and applies the concepts, and frustrating because she didn\u2019t tell us how the story ends (she hinted, but didn\u2019t answer the big question: does Henry live?).[...]I\u2019ve highlighted 59 passages, and that\u2019s in the ebook (which is how I know. Kindle counts them for me). I think I\u2019m going to have to buy the book so I can read it again and highlight with \u201creal\u201d highlighters, and see the sample Scene Card properly\u2014I don\u2019t think it showed up properly in my electronic review copy.Recommended. You may or may not want to follow the methodology, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll learn something.Thanks to Ten Speed Press and NetGalley for providing a free ebook for review.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!",
                "reviewText": "Um... where do I start? Okay, how about: THANK YOU FOR THIS BOOK. After a year and a half of trying to \"fix\" my manuscript, primarily my protagonist, Lisa Cron's book FINALLY pinpointed my root issue. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!Imagine getting similar feedback from fellow writers, agents, and betas, raising your hopes by stating you have an excellent plot, great and memorable characters, and a nifty style of writing, etc., BUT, there seems to be no \"theme\" and your MC falls flat. *Ouch*Anyway, so I came across this book, STORY GENIUS, who had high reviews and touched on a nerve when I read the [ *Before You Waste Three Years Writing 327 Pages That Go Nowhere ] bit. 'Cause, well, it's been close to that long since I finished my first draft.I bought the book and began reading it, but had low expectations. My expectations dropped even lower after I couldn't read past a few pages at a time... without dozing off. Yep, seriously. (Mind you, I can devour a 300 page book in about 4 hrs or less.) Just something about her writing made my eyes gloss over, and I'd have to go back and reread things, two to three times.I almost quit reading it because of that reason alone, but, I stuck it out and just read a chapter at a time and started to do the exercises she prompts you to do. And, man... if the putting me to sleep thing wasn't bad enough, the exercises were like pulling teeth. So I kinda \"skim did them.\" Like skim reading, only it was halfheartedly completing them. And it took me almost two weeks just to get through 8 exercises! Finally, 8 exercises later and half-way through the book, I got tired of wracking my brain and decided that I wasn't learning anything. So I opened up my latest draft of my MS and was going to just try tinkering with it a bit.And, omgosh... on just the first line alone, I was like: why did I write that? My MC wouldn't think that.AND THAT WAS WHEN I REALIZED that even though the exercises felt like they weren't doing anything for me, stuff I'd learned had sunk in and I'd actually finally grasped what my issue was. I didn't have a clue who my MC really was!I'd initially based my MC off myself, and just kept saying that I'd reveal her personal backstory in book two. But I know now that that was just an excuse because I hadn't come up with anything solid. I couldn't answer things like: what happened to her parents? Why/how does she have supernatural abilities? Why would anyone risk their life for her? Why does everything just happen \"around\" her? What are her personal stakes? And the list goes on.But once you pinpoint that seed of a backstory--not just any old makeshift backstory, but specific events in your MC's history up to the start of your MS, all guided step by step in the book--ideas just keep manifesting out of the blue, about as quickly as a snowball rolling downhill. Now, not only do I know exactly who my MC is--which is making revisions fun and exciting, and has rekindled that passion I had when writing my first draft years ago--but I've found that missing piece of the puzzle that turns an already good story into a great one.Sorry for the \"novel\" lol. But, really, you need this book. Highly recommend it! Happy writing! :)",
