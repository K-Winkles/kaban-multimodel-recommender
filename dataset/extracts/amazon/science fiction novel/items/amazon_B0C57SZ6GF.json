The characters were well developed, particularly for a shorter novel. And there was enough believable science (for this non scientist reader) to give it weight. I'm interested in reading more about the playground/ colony of Elonia, and watch Tally, the first Martian child grow into adulthood. I'm curious as to what her role will be as she matures.",

                "reviewText": "With any new book or series I always have some trepidations. Will I like the writing style since I\u2019m picky? Will the story be interesting to me? Will the characters be relatable or at least interesting?The writing style is easy to read and enjoy. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m reading either a technical manual or a kids book. It strikes a nice balance where it\u2019s just simply nice to ready.The story is laid in such a way that you have current events happening and flashbacks filling in backstory. It manages to progress and enhance the story while also making you want to see what happens on the next page. The story somehow low key sucks you in. I think that\u2019s really down to the pacing. Which the author nailed in my opinion.As for the characters they were a joy to go on this journey with. They had ups and down. Highs and lows. The relationships felt interesting and didn\u2019t drag the story down into something which I didn\u2019t care about.I believe that last line nicely sums up the whole book. Over 237 pages the author managed to let me care about the characters. You can tell that the story and writing, and pacing were done with care. And if you meet Logan Russell, as I did at Legendary Con in Waynesburg, pa, you can hear the care with which this story has been written.Also, the cover art is pretty cool too.",

                "reviewText": "\"Playground Mars\" is the second novel by author Logan Russell and makes for a thoroughly engaging read! The story follows young Tally as she goes on a mission to rescue her family on Mars - while in the meantime battling her own loneliness as an outsider on a planet full of outsiders. It turns out that Mars is both a playground for children and adults. I especially enjoyed the relationship Tally forms with AI computer interface Jasper. In our society where people feel increasingly isolated from one another, will computers come and fill that void? The book was a page-turner and clearly shows how Russell's writing has matured since his first novel LUCA in 2017. I recommend the book to any fan of science fiction and I look forward to potential sequels!",
