                "reviewText": "The story is unusual for Kindle Unlimited in that it is very much a in-flight novel rather than quickly written novellas written to formulae that we normally see.It made an interesting usage of both the fear of bodysnatcher stories combined with the more conventional ufo ideas.It all works. There are some howlers, the order to launch F22s off an aircraft carrier stood out, for one example. Such things can be quickly fixed (hint subtract 4 for f18).Next stop book 2.",
