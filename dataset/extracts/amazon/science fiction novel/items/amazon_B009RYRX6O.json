                "reviewText": "*Book source ~ My home library.Kris Bjornsen was going about her day at Denver University when the Catteni attacked Earth. Scooping up citizens by the thousands from 50 cities around the world the Catteni ships took their new slaves to Barevi, a planet used by the Catteni for R&R and a depot for their purloined goods from around the galaxy. Kris manages to escape her new `master' and is hiding out in the wilds of Barevi when a chance encounter with Zainal, an Emassi (or high ranking Catteni), changes her life yet again. Gassed during a riot she and Zainal are dumped onto an empty world the Catteni have chosen for the aliens to colonize. Terrans make up the largest group, but there are also Deski, Rugarians, Turs and Ilginish. Fortunately for them, they have Zainal who knows a little bit about the initial survey of the planet. Unfortunately for Zainal, no one likes Catteni and there's a large consensus to kill him. Chuck Mitford, a retired Marine, takes charge of the motley crew and makes a command decision to keep Zainal alive. For now. With only knives, hatchets, blankets and ration bars, they have to work together to survive on an alien planet.I love, love, love this book. There's something about survival books I really like and I think it's because I put myself into that situation and wonder how well I'd do. But this isn't just any old survival situation on Earth where you can hope to eventually find civilization. Cell phones, a grocery store, a bed, hot water, a toothbrush. Forget it. This is an alien planet. Completely unknown. What is safe to eat? What will kill me? Are there dangerous animals? Is there shelter? What kind of weather is to be expected and how long are the days? Or nights? Back to basics in a way that's hard to do on Earth anymore.I've read this book (and the whole series) several times over the years and I've enjoyed it each and every time. So much to do and so much to explore with people and aliens who are strangers. The book mostly follows Kris as she survives on the planet they name Bounty and once again it kept me enthralled the whole time. The world is unique, the writing is wonderful and I love the characters. There is action, mystery, humor and even romance. All-in-all an excellent sci-fi adventure.",

                "reviewText": "I like a lot of Anne McCaffrey's works, and I think no one writes a better female protagonist than she does. Freedom's Landing is the first in the Freedom Series, but it's a bit confusing to me because years ago, the book seemed to be different or there was another book (was it Thorns of Barevi?) where Kristen, the main character, experienced the Catteni invasion of Denver. Apparently the series was re-written, but information about the Catteni I read years ago was missing (there was a lot of sex in the original, apparently written out, and more about the original invasion.) This book deals with a renegade Emassi (noble) Catteni and Kristen landing on a colonization planet and, with other kidnapped humans and aliens, surviving and creating a new society. Apparently, the Catteni seed new worlds with kidnapped \"colonists\" and take over planets with the survivors.Despite my confusion at the story having changed, I soon got into the novel and enjoyed the development of technology and survival techniques by the various survivors. Some of it was a bit farfetched (they were able to create walkie-talkies from scrapped automated farm equipment) but over all, it was a fast-moving and exciting tale. It reminds me a bit of Robert Heinlein's \"Starship Troopers\" mixed with \"Tunnel in the Sky\".McCaffrey wrote many great series. I'm indifferent to the Dragon series, but love her Crystal Singer books and this series is almost as good. If you like action in sci-fi, you'll enjoy this",

                "reviewText": "A typically great work from Anne McCaffrey.Although she is known primarily for her stories of the mythical world of Pern with the life there of interaction between flying dragons and humans, she writes other stories of science fiction and fantasy as well. This is one of those stories and to me, it fits both genres.This is the first of a series and I see it having the potential to expand to Pern like dimensions. I hope she continues it soon.There is action, suspense, conflict and resolution. The action starts with the two protagonists first in conflict with each other and then their joint escape from the forces after both of them The conflict is both intra-species and inter-species with resolution by both physical force and force of will. Suspense comes from wondering if they will not only survive, being thrown onto a new and hostile planet, but will they thrive in both the strangeness and familiarity of the situation they find themselves in. Conflict exists in the struggle to overcome the obstacles they find in a new world and the struggles of different cultures coexisting. Resolution of all these issues is what the story is about and isn't that the story of us all as we go through life?There are three other books of this series available here on Amazon.",
