My daughter, age 9, suffered significant brain damage at birth that lead to a lot of motor planning deficits and learning disabilities. She knows the story of her birth, what makes her different, and how occupational therapy and speech therapy is helping her. I taught her the basics of how our brains work and where her brain damage is. This book goes into a lot more detail in a wonderful comic book style with a humorous plot perfect for teaching the nervous system without being strictly informational. I can not wait to read it with her!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Filled with tons of information!",
                "reviewText": "Brought to you by OBS reviewer AndraI have read a couple of graphic novels in the Science Comics series (Science Comics: Plagues: The Microscopic Battlefield and Science Comics: Robots and Drones: Past, Present, and Future) and quite enjoyed those titles so thought I would pick up Science Comics: The Brain \u2013 The Ultimate Thinking Machine.Fahama is essentially kidnapped and to be used as part of an experiment by \u201cThe Evil Brain\u201d. Luckily, she is quick on her feet and keeps asking her captor questions. And this is where the reader picks up all the information about the brain.I liked segments like the following where humour was interjected into the information being disseminated:\u201cThe eye is one of my favorite body parts. EYE love it because it\u2019s a CORNEA-copia of puns!\u201d\u201cYour (vitreous) humor is the WORST.\u201d\u201cI see what you did there.\u201d\u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m a good PUPIL.\u201dI really enjoyed learning so many new things\u2026for example \u2013 how and in what theEgyptians kept when they mummified their dead. The jars were called canopic jars. They removed the brain through the back of the head via the Foramen magnum. Who knew? Or being told how fast nerve signals can move \u2013> up to 540 kph (335 mph)!I am a bit perplexed about Fahima\u2019s sister \u2013 the Girl Scout with attitude\u2026 not sure I liked her bullying tactics or calling Troop 7 scum. Not very nice and not really something I like in a book (graphic novel or otherwise) where I know youth will be reading. Also, I found her attitude towards her mom to be disrespectful.There were certainly little nuggets throughout that you could tell were for the younger crowd:\u201cThe brain stem regulates things you don\u2019t think about, like your heart rate and breathing, but it\u2019s also in charge of things like sneezing and barfing!\u201dOrWhen discussing how large the neocortex is when flattened out like a newspaper or pizza box:\u201cThat\u2019s both gross and cool!\u201d- \u201dMost things in biology are.\u201dOne thing I have to say about this book is that it is filled with SO much information \u2013 I felt like my brain was going to explode (hee hee). I also at times found the transitions abrupt. For example, when discussing taste and then the next page jumps right into hearing. There needed to be a more gradual transition into the next topic. Possibly with further editing, these transitions would not seem so unexpected.From my experience each volume of Science Comics offers a complete introduction to a particular topic\u2014 plagues, solar systems, dinosaurs, coral reefs, the solar system, volcanoes, bats, flying machines, etc. So far, they are attractively illustrated graphic novels offering wildly entertaining views of their specific subject matters. The audience for these wonderful books seems to be very wide\u2026elementary student, high schooler or an adult expanding their horizons\u2026 these graphic novels are wonderful for all.",

My 8 year old daughter loves to read them even though I'm sure she's not understanding ALL the content. Awesome non-fiction series to spark an interest in fun science topics.",
