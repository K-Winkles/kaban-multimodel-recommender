She\u2019ll be a tall, sturdy female to help with the chores and bear his children.Unfortunately, the person that arrives is Nicola. She\u2019s small, delicate\u2026and human.

                "reviewText": "After reading \u2018Bad guy\u2019 I got curious about this series, especially after meeting a couple of the \u2018Risdaverse\u2019 series in this story. I wanted to read more about this special world.I must say that I really enjoyed this story. It may only be a novella length story but it was well developed. The story was light, fun but it also had emotional elements in it.Alien soldier Emvor is living a peaceful life on a farmer planet but after many lovely nights, he decides that he wants a wife. So he orders a mail-order bride, he expects a strong, mesakkah woman (someone like him, a blue-skinned alien with horns and a tail) but soon after her arrival Emvor discovers that his new bride is a human!! A small, fragile female. Someone who can\u2019t help him on the farm. What will he do now?Just like so many other human women, Nicola was abducted by aliens. She was only 12 years old but she was one of the \u2018lucky\u2019 ones. She was a slave to a kind, alien lady and she had a \u2018good\u2019 life. But her owner is getting old and so Nicola has to look for another place to stay. The universe is a dangerous place for a human so Nicola has to be very careful. Luckily for Nicola, Emvor may be grumpy and silent but he has a good heart and so he lets her stay with him after he discovers her secret and promise to help her look for a new husband. Meanwhile, Nicola is staying in his house. Soon, both of them discover that they like each other company. They may be different but they still share some things too. Will Emvor change his mind and keep Nicola as a wife or not?\u2018The alien\u2019s mail-order bride\u2019 was an entertaining and well written story. It\u2019s not so long but it had everything in it that I liked in my stories. You got both POV\u2019s.I liked both main characters very much. Emvor was an ex-soldier, who had scars in his face and a limp. He was a grumpy, silent, lonely alien guy but he was also a hard worker, honest and respectful. He was just a good guy.Nicola was such a positive, cheery, sweet character! I really loved her. She was just looking for a place to call home. It was so sweet to see how she was turning Emvor\u2019s house into a home. They were perfect for each other. We got to read a bit about both their past but not in great detail but I didn\u2019t mind that. There was a steamy sex scene at the end of the story.I\u2019m happy that I tried this story. It was just what I was looking for. A light, fun and quick read.(But be warned, these stories are very addictive!! After finishing this one, I bought a few more and have already read two more stories.)",

He needs help around the farm and companionship. In fact, he doesn\u2019t even care what his blue bride-to-be looks like; he just needs someone around. He\u2019s ex-military and is scarred from it, which is why he thinks he\u2019s not handsome, but he\u2019s alone, and that\u2019s why he ordered a bride.When his bride arrives, he notices something\u2019s off- she\u2019s limiting her movements and isn\u2019t talking much. It isn\u2019t until they arrive to his farm that his bride takes off her mask\u2026 she\u2019s not an alien; she\u2019s a human, and she\u2019s looking for safety.Nicola\u2019s (24) ready to get married and have kids, which is what Emvor\u2019s looking for. Her previous owner considered her a pet, but ever since she died, Nicola\u2019s had to fend for herself. She needs stability and hopes to find it with Emvor.But Emvor needs someone bigger and stronger than Nicola \ud83d\ude2c. He\u2019s willing to help her look for a suitable man to marry.If only he could ignore the feelings he\u2019s feeling \ud83d\udc40I loved/liked:-how jealous Emvor gets \ud83e\udd23. This alien gets jealous of his own thoughts \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude05\u2014the tension/buildup\ud83d\udc40. Yes, it\u2019s a short book, but it mostly focuses on their relationship\u2014the breeeeding aspect \ud83d\ude09\u2014the \ud83d\udd25. Sigh. They\u2019re learning each other, and even though he\u2019s not a virgin (she is), he\u2019s never been with a human.\u2014learning how to kiss \ud83d\udd25 and learning what that little nub is hidden \ud83e\udd75\u2014Emvor\u2019s regret over being with others \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.

It ends so abruptly\u2014no epilogue/rushed ending \ud83d\ude10. We don\u2019t see what happens after they\u2019re finally intimate \ud83d\ude2d. Babies? Marriage?

                "reviewText": "Emvor is a soldier turn farmer in a remote planet and after years of solitude he has decided to get himself a wife. A Mesakka female will be strong enough to helping around the farm and worm his bed. The last thing he expects is a small, flat face and pale human. Nicola is a human kidnapped as a child and living as a pet for a rich old Mesakka female. But her owner is now dead and her safe existence is now now....non existent. Under disguise she travels to a isolated planet to marry a alien and finally find a secure place to call home. Heartwarming quick read. Highly recommended",
