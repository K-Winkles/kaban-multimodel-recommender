It's a misconception that you have to be a beginner to enjoy this book; in fact, I found that even as an advanced learner, I could appreciate the carefully selected stories and effectively brush up on my vocabulary and comprehension. It's a versatile tool that anyone looking to improve their French can benefit from, regardless of their proficiency level.",

You don't feel like you're actually 'working' because the author uses great, classic stories to read in both languages (English and French), so you're constantly double-checking your proficiency. I highly recommend this book and look forward to more.",
