The fates have spoken.I don\u2019t just want to mate this female.I want to bond her.No alien clan lord can claim her...BelleI didn\u2019t plan on washing up on a backwater planet shared with an alien race. But I\u2019ve made the best of it, setting up my own bakery and making a life here.Until one of those aliens walks into my shop and literally carries me away.But something\u2019s not right.I\u2019m kidnapped and alone with a giant snake-man.I should be scared, but I\u2019m not. Far from it.I want to tame this alien beast.The books in the Brides of Rhan series can all be read as stand-alones, each with a different couple. But they\u2019re all connected, and intended for steamy readers! The books all feature bonding, instalove, and baby-logues.",

But tossing Belle Adams over his shoulder and kidnapping her doesn't work in the no-strings fashion he expected. Belle is a blonde, but not the least bit dumb, and Kallan finds his self-assured world turned upside down by the feisty and independent bakery owner. Their attraction to each other is instantaneous but saying their cultural differences are significant is an understatement. However, where there's a will there's a way, and after several miscues, the lovers manage to negotiate their way to a compromise and their unexpected mate-bond gives them a permanent happily ever after.I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review.",

Their species, the Rhan, are not producing heirs, so they'll have to choose from other species, and he's been told to find a human bride. He finds a store- Blondies- picks one up, pays and leaves. Belle was working in her bakery with a friend when an alien comes in and takes her away. I loved the misunderstanding here- it made me laugh. He thought he was going into a store selling blonde women, and was surprised to learn it is a cake. The attraction between them is immediate, even though Belle had never imagined an alien would walk through her doors, and Kallan thought humans too small and weak. A fun and good start to a new series. 5 stars.",
