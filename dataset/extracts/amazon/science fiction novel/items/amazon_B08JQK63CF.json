Charlotte must come up with a way to save the Earth and everyone on it before it is too late.When Charlotte and her friends inform the President with the information of what is about to take place she is offered a top-secret job working with top scientists from around the world to help solve the danger and find a new place for everyone to live. But first, they must come up with a safe way to travel into space if they are to succeed with their plan.Brazen Planet is a very unique and interesting story that kept me glued to the pages as I raced through each one to see how it was all going to turn out. The story was well written and thought out. I loved all the characters. I loved who they were and the kind of people they are.Brazen Planet is a great introduction to a whole brand new world in the Tears of Venus series. I can\u2019t wait to read more from this world in the second book, First Colony: A New World Exploration Story. Just the title itself is enough to draw me in.I highly recommend Brazen Planet to all science fiction and dystopian fans. One-click your copy of this amazing book, Brazen Planet today for another epic read from author Gayle Katz! And be sure to check out the rest of her books as well!",

                "reviewText": "Unbelievable that the president would take the word of some random woman dropping in to tell him that the sun was dying, ask her to save the world and give unlimited money to do it. I liked the story but the simplified ease of how they built a spaceship and went to Venus, found an underground place to live was a stretch. Maybe the second book will be a little more believable. If this is a book for young readers, it may make sense; but book description did not specify this.",

                "reviewText": "Gayle Katz has introduced a new intriguing series of science fiction action-adventure stories with a subtle touch of romance. This presents a very interesting, thought-provoking theory, whose antithesis is global warming. It rapidly moves through scenes of danger, sadness, perseverance, altruism, and love. It underscores the corruption of government, more concerned about maintaining short-term power rather than the long-term well-being of its citizens. The main characters, Charlotte & Peter, are well-developed with a minimum of supporting characters. The story is well-written and absent of grammatical and punctuation errors, which distract the reader. There is a small segue to hook into the sequel, which I will definitely be buying. Very entertaining and refreshing! Keep 'em coming ! ! P.S. Sci-fi aficionados should also consider Gayle's nasty zombies when pondering the global pandemic.",
