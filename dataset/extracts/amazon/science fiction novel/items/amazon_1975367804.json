My only real nitpick is that some of the names like Bukubukuchagama are rather confusingly (for fans of the series like me at least already familiar with their Japanese names) translated into English. The first time I read \"BubblingTeapot\" I was confused but figured out who it was by a bit of googling and some context clues. Not really much else to say other than that So-Bin and Maruyama outdid themselves once again with the art and writing respectively.",

                "reviewText": "I only give 4 out of 5 to an author that consistently pumps out 5 star LNs because of pacing. The book was an entertaining read but did little in the way of world building, and unfortunately, the story pacing fell flat on its face here. There were less than 20 pages that truly moved the plot along it felt like. Volume 15 was fluff along with lore and character building, but volume 16 was mostly an add to that fluff, like perhaps 90% to 95% fluff. That being said, with only 2 more volumes to go, perhaps the next two will somehow build off this one in unquie ways that makes the filler an important linchpin. Without giving spoilers, there wasn't too much open ended points for offshoots, nor new jumping points, with the end of the first chapter being a story enchantment possibility, and the end of the second chapter which answers an important question Ainz had, while progressing the story to the end.I know light novels should be light with the standard 200 page range, but these volumes would have been better as a side story release and combined for a full book.I don't regret binge reading this volume at all, but I do wish there had been more to it.5 stars to the author though who is writing this series as a passionate hobby, and has a different full-time day job that isn't writing (or authoring related at all I believe I read somewhere but don't quote me on that).",
