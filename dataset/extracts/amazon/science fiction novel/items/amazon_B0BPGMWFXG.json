                "reviewText": "Arcanus by Ali K. Eke is a captivating sci-fi novel that combines elements of magic, science, and an alternate history to deliver an intriguing and immersive reading experience. Set in a world where magic and technology coexist, the story explores the consequences of an arms race between imperial powers and the delicate balance maintained by a global organization of mages known as Bastion.The author paints a vivid picture of a society on the brink of transformation, where magic and science clash in a battle for supremacy. The premise of a world where magic once ruled, but is now being challenged by the rise of modern warfare, adds a unique layer of tension and intrigue to the narrative. The contrast between the old ways and the emergence of new technologies creates a rich backdrop against which the story unfolds.The protagonist, Kibo Kozlov, is a relatable and determined character whose dreams of joining Bastion are initially hindered by his inability to control magic. This sets up an engaging personal journey as Kibo stumbles upon a mysterious artifact that holds the potential to reshape the world's future. Through Kibo's eyes, readers are taken on an adventure filled with discovery, danger, and self-discovery.The world-building in Arcanus is commendable, with a careful blend of magical elements and technological advancements. The author brings the settings to life, from the grand imperial powers of Russia and Great Britain to the intricate workings of Bastion itself. The intricacies of magic and the implications of its integration with science are explored, providing a rich and immersive backdrop for the unfolding events.Eke's writing style is fluid and descriptive, allowing readers to easily visualize the scenes and empathize with the characters. The pacing of the story is well-maintained, with a balance of action, suspense, and moments of introspection. The plot unfolds gradually, gradually revealing secrets and building towards a climactic finale.While the novel offers a fascinating premise and engaging characters, there are moments where certain subplots or character arcs could have been further explored or developed. These missed opportunities slightly dampen the overall impact of the story but do not detract significantly from the overall enjoyment.In conclusion, Arcanus is a captivating sci-fi novel that blends magic, technology, and alternate history to create an immersive world filled with intrigue and adventure. Ali K. Eke's skillful storytelling, well-crafted world-building, and relatable characters make this book a compelling read for fans of the genre. If you're looking for a unique blend of magic and science in a richly imagined world, Arcanus is a book worth delving into.",

The bad thing is that the author tried to pivot the storyline two-thirds through the book and it just doesn't work. The antagonists aren't interesting or meaningful. The last part of the story doesn't build on the main characters. There is also a mysterious secondary character that is vital to the story who helps the main character immensely that is not expanded on and mostly forgotten about. Parts of the book were OK, but it could use some work.",
