I gave the author 5 stars because I understand why it had to be so dry until the action started so I\u2019d know the technicalities behind what was going on, yet\u2026 was it necessary? I\u2019m a forever student, so learning new things on top of what I already understand isn\u2019t a bad thing. I do caution others who are looking into reading this, that this is indeed hard science fiction. Also, if you don\u2019t have a fundamental grasp on some physics and/or space science this book might not be for you. I\u2019m hoping the second book has more adventure and less subtle, manipulative elements of teaching.",

                "reviewText": "It is a bit much. The main idea about an observatory at the sun focal point is well known and described in various papers and I was sorry the author didn\u2019t explore that more. The idea of the true nature of the crew was good and well thought out. The physics expressed by Newton was good, although needlessly repetitive. The DFD is an experimental concept that in no way can produce the levels of thrust stated thanks to the physics that define just how much inertial mass for propellant you would need. The missions Ops team, CapCom, MOM, et al, was very thin and does those who are in that role a disservice. They are not so dumb, and are in fact , very involved in the physics and details of a mission at a very a deep level. The idea of AlphaOmega was not interesting and even weird. It could have been deleted without changing the story in any important way. The date 2079 was way off\u2026add 200 years; my mortgage will be paid off at about then. The so call quantum aspects\u2026entanglement on steroids, let\u2019s say - was over the top. Ok, fiction again, I get it. But it ultimately reads like one of those pop gee- wiz science books so prevalent these days. Prove it, even the smallest aspect of it, and I might believe it. Lastly, the writing needs work; perhaps a good editor that can straighten out the entanglement - no pun intended - of the dialogue and plot. I could barely finish the novel; by the end it had become predictable and boring.The author has written a wide range of sci-fi novels and I truly admire him for all that. He has a vision and dedication. But to make it work with the public at large, he needs to focus his vision. He should re-read Arthur C Clark. A contemporary writer he might want to read might be Adrian Tchaikovsky.",

It is suspected that Christine may have attempted to kill herself and destroy the ship -but why?At the same time, cause and effect appears to be running in the wrong direction every now and then - for example doors open before the button is pressed to tell them to...Also the structure of Christine's capsule appears to breaking down.What is going on?This intriguing tale combines suspense, intrigue, double crosses, kidnaps and other peculiar happenings with an overzealous leader, and quantum entanglement of an unusual order.....All is revealed as the story slowly unfolds......A highly entertaining novel that is an enjoyable and thought provoking read.",

I began to suspect a disturbance in the quantum field of the story when Eric replaced David and everyone's memories were a little scrambled. I would give five stars for the story line on the Shepherd, but only 3.5 to 4 stars for the story line with Rachel and Mission Control, hence the 4 stars overall. I feel the Shepherd could stand on its own with a little more development of the characters, whereas the Rachel part of the story didn't really add much to advancing the story. Except for the suspicions aroused by the date discrepancies. I love true hard-sf. I will definitely add this author to my list of favorites. I really, really want to know what Christine discovered at the end (or is it beginning?) of the cosmos.",

I think the problem was trying to wrap my head around how an SGL would work to see back in time. Anyway, I just bought the second one and excited to see where this goes!",

I loved his space exploration/First contact Solar system series and Ice moon series in particular. This new serie is a good one as well as is the recent Lost Moon.Most SF are basically earth regular themes like battles, wars and the evil Alien monsters, soap opera in Space vs on Earth...Hard SF is very hard to find as the author needs extensive knowledge of science which is definitely the case for M. Morris.I find that his newer books include more AI and in a very realistic non sensationalistic way. I love the way it makes me think about what is consciousness and how it expands beyond humans.",

Vermutlich sollte das Problem von Langzeitweltraumreisen und deren Auswirkung auf Organismen dadurch behandelt werden. Der gew\u00e4hlte Ansatz wird dabei jedoch direkt, also durch den Author, zu einem Problem aus Sicht der Charaktere deklariert ohne wirklich die Substanz (und da g\u00e4be es tats\u00e4chlich inhaltliches Potential) zu behandeln. Die \"Aufl\u00f6sungen\" werden dadurch zum Klischee und hinterlassen einen mit wenig Neuem nach dem Ende des Buchs.

The reader is in for a number of surprises as the plot progresses. There are some heart-stopping moments for the crew (and the reader, of course!) so be prepared for the adrenalin rushes.I particularly enjoyed the final section. In a way, it was surplus to requirements.... but SO appreciated! I'm reading number 2 soon. Can't wait!",

I wanted at least to know how it ended but it was not worth it. Hard science fiction should not mean throwing in a lot of science bubble and nothing else",
