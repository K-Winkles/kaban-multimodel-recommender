        "description": "Before the Blight, becoming an adult was something teenagers looked forward to. But now, turning 18 means certain death.Unless you prove yourself worthy of the Cure.On her 17th birthday, Ashen Spencer is blindfolded and escorted to the massive, mysterious building known as the Arc to begin her year of training and testing in hopes that she can earn the Cure - a powerful drug given only to those deemed worthy to survive beyond their 18th birthday. Ashen has a chance to rise up from her former life of squalor and be granted a place in society, if the Panel - the mysterious group of powerful men and women in charge of the Arc - deems her year a success. She's assigned to live for twelve months with a wealthy family whose son is the most alluring young man she's ever met. At first, Ashen is grateful for the opportunity to earn her place in a society she's always dreamed of inhabiting. But as time passes and she begins to learn the truth about the people she admires so much and the home she left behind, she realizes she has a choice: Be part of the disease.... Or be part of the Cure. For fans of The Hunger Games, Divergent, and The Selection. Read more",

Will I read the rest of the series? Maybe, but only if I need a fast simple read.",

This was my first time reading her work and I\u2019m an instant fan. I can understand why this novel and others are slowly climbing the bestseller rankings. The title is well-deserved.Thinking she\u2019s entering the sweepstakes for the cure to the disease ravaging the adults in her neighborhood, Ashen willingly enters the Arc for a year of \u201ctesting\u201d to prove herself (and so she\u2019s been told her family) worthy of receiving the precious medicine. She soon realizes she\u2019s entered not a utopia but the worst sort of dystopian life, and that\u2019s when the fun begins.I won\u2019t spoil it, as you NEED TO READ THIS BOOK! It had been on my TBR for months and now I\u2019m wondering why I didn\u2019t bump it up. Don\u2019t make the same mistake, as you\u2019ll want to read through this now complete series and probably start a few more of her newer series.",

The plot is good really good like taking the award home at the end of the day kind of good but the characters are cardboard or comic book style if you will. You have one point of view but many characters with only base line thought and some of the lines were so cheeseball they made me laugh. The main character seems a bit empty headed reiterating the same thoughts with not much else. Its worth the read and dear author I can't wait to see what you do in the future for their is so much potential in your ideas but your skill set is lacking for the proper greatness your ideas deserve. I mean that only in the best way and thank you for sharing your books with the world.",
