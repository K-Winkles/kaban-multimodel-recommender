Kind of like the way Stephen King does it, where it just paints the picture with the right details to set the scene without going overboard. Being a kid that grew up driving to the Jersey Shore through the Pine Barrens, it was really cool to read a story set in that unique landscape. I am looking forward to the next book by Mr. Blatherwick. Buy it today - I'm sure you will enjoy it as much as I did.",
