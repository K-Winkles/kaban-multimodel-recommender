It starts out fast and the pace continues on in a delightful collage of battles, spacewalks, aliens, ghost ships and a creepy planet. I am onto the next book as soon as i finish this review.",

I would say I got what I paid for, easily able to feel immersed in the story I was reading - I finished the book in less than a week. It was an exciting read, full of eerie scenery and action, but I have to knock this 4 star book down to 3 stars because of the proofreading. This book has to have hundreds of spelling errors, grammatical mistakes, and missing punctuation. Character\u2019s names were even misspelled. It became distracting at times, taking away from the excitement of the book. I understand this is an independent publishing, so I\u2019m cutting the author some slack, but it\u2019s as if this book was never proofread at all.",

If you thought the undead, mutating flesh monsters, strange alien monoliths and unexplained ghosts from the video game were scary; you'll enjoy this.Setup is just slow enough to build tension and creep factor but the ending feels very rushed in the last stretch as if it was just an outline that didn't get fleshed out.Book is a good prologue to more adventure and body horror in the sequels this book sets up. I'll probably get the next one to see what direction the story goes.",

You are abbreviating Would Have, \"would of\" is utter gibberish, then we have the incorrect use of the basic \"To\" & \"Too\", these i keep seeing on Twitter & Reddit, clearly standards are falling, but in a book? Proofreading? Editing? Publishing?PURE ILLITERACY.Then lastly the story, started out interesting, the characters every third word is the F word though, for no apparent reason, they say too much profanity is a sign of a poor vocabulary & poor grasp of English, so maybe this connects to my previous points?Sadly though the interesting concepts of the story are never followed through, answers are never given, & the ending is a rushed cop out where everyone is killed, which makes you wonder who wrote the story?Why should the purchaser of a novel have to not only read it but correct grammar, punctuation & basic junior school level spelling? Without being paid?I dread to think what illiterate twaddle is going to appear over the next few years!",
