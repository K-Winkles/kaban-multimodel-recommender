        "description": "The New York Times best-selling origin story of the Master Chief - part of the expanded universe based on the award-winning video game series Halo!The 26th century. Humanity has expanded beyond Earth\u2019s system to hundreds of planets that colonists now call home. But the United Earth Government and the United Nations Space Command is struggling to control this vast empire. After exhausting all strategies to keep seething colonial insurrections from exploding into a full-blown interplanetary civil war, the UNSC has one last hope. At the Office of Naval Intelligence, Dr. Catherine Halsey has been hard at work on a top-secret program that could bring an end to the conflict...and it starts with 75 children, among them a six-year-old boy named John. And Halsey could never guess that this child will eventually become the final hope against an even greater peril engulfing the galaxy - the inexorable confrontation with a theocratic military alliance of alien races known as the Covenant.This is the electrifying origin story of Spartan John-117 - the Master Chief - and of his legendary, unstoppable heroism in leading the resistance against humanity\u2019s possible extinction.

Amazing story with updated and reworked events to include the expansions that the series has seen through the years.

The book does a phenomenal job at at providing us insight into the spartan program and the candidates training at a very young age. It shows the early life of John 117 along with blue team as well as giving you an insight to his mind and the spartan program. It also displays the mother-ish relationship between Halsey and the Spartans. A must read for Halo fans",

                "reviewText": "From the start, as the Master Chief and his team kill countless Grunts, you can feel the adrenaline that the Chief would have felt... and that's it... you are hooked. So many close calls and near-death experiences keep you, the reader, on edge. You have the chance to experience the life of a legend, to walk in his shoes. All of the experiences you and the Cheif go through give immeasurable value to the Halo games. Unfortunately, I almost wish I could forget the book and read it again to have the same thrill as the first time I read it. All around an amazing book.The only notable flaw with the events of the game is halo reach. In the game, noble 6 gives Cortana to the pillar of Autumn that had been stationed for restorations, but in this book, the pillar of Autumn never actually enters into the planet's atmosphere plus Cortana had been given to the chief a while before the battle of reach, but that is it.I would rate this book a 6 out of 5 stars. Would read again... for the 5th time... I'm not a psychopath... I promise... read this book",

This is a great series so far but its just getting started. Oh to be a millionaire and be able to afford all the series at once. I'm going to continue to buy these one at a time and slow my reading speed so I might be able to afford the next one. I am in my 60s and living cheap so everything counts at th his age.

                "reviewTitle": "Gripping account of humanity in peril",
                "reviewText": "If I said I haven\u2019t read much sci-fi since I was a teenager I\u2019d be lying because in the last year I\u2019ve read ten novels in The Expanse series (and watched the TV series on Amazon Prime). Then I started watching the Halo series on Amazon Prime and decided to read this book, not realising that there are about twenty volumes in the Halo series, written by different authors. Very much a team effort, like the Spartans, who are the elite super-soldiers protecting us from the Covenant \u2013 the evil aliens who want to wipe out humanity.First, let me offload some gripes and prejudices. According to the \u201cfore world\u201d, this book was conceived and written in four months \u2013 and it shows. In some places the writing is a bit sloppy. We\u2019re told several times that the Spartans have standing orders to seize any alien technology they can get their hands on. Fine. We only needed to hear that once. Every chapter begins with a precise location and date for the action, down to the exact hour, yet despite that the author and the backup team manage to lose a decade during the course of the novel. John \u2013 the Master Chief \u2013 and the other Spartans are kidnapped as six-year-olds in 2517. The main action takes place in 2552. According to my arithmetic that\u2019s 35 years later, yet a key character is convinced that the gap is only 25 years. It means that characters are ten years older than the author apparently thinks. We have senior officers calling John \u201cson\u201d when he\u2019s 41 years old, which is really really patronising given his martial prowess! Remember, he and his comrades performed their first successful mission against the aliens as 14-year-olds. Another gripe \u2013 or prejudice \u2013 is that the prevailing culture in 2552 is pure American. This novel seems to have been written in 2001. Twenty-odd years later, the chances of the US providing the dominant culture over the next five hundred years seem increasingly remote. Specifically, we\u2019re given a \u201cPentagon\u201d culture that in many ways feels a bit like the US in the 1960s Vietnam rather than the twenty-first, never mind, the twenty-sixth century. I say that because despite some notable victories, humanity is losing this war against the Covenant, and the top brass are getting increasingly desperate. One more gripe is about technology. As in The Expanse series, we have a strange mix of futuristic technology (spaceships that can travel in another dimension and colonisation of distant planets) and contemporary hardware (guns that fire bullets, electric cars). There is AI but even the most sophisticated AI beings are only there to assist humans. They haven\u2019t taken over yet. You can\u2019t help wondering why all the fighting isn\u2019t being done by drones and robots and these AI beings rather than by people. But that\u2019s the problem: if the available technology was used to its fullest extent this would be a novel about machines rather than about humans.Having said all that, the novel is an enjoyable piece of escapism with some great action and some genuinely compelling characters. There\u2019s Dr Catherine Halsey, the enigmatic genius scientist who conceived the Spartan programme. We\u2019ve not been told anything about her origins in this volume, maybe that will come later, but she has a brilliant mind and she seems to be committed to saving humanity from destruction \u2013 by any means necessary. John, who becomes leader of the Spartans, is shown as flawed and vulnerable. He\u2019s not the biggest, fastest or strongest Spartan, but he has deeper qualities that make him the natural leader. Then we have the AI, Cortana, who turns out to be a very human piece of software. And Captain Jacob Keyes, the pipe-smoking officer who does what Admiral Horatio Nelson in another war said we should all do \u2013 our \u201cduty\u201d.I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys science fiction or action and adventure stuff. I understand that this is not the first Halo novel to be written but it is some kind of prequel, so I\u2019m wondering which way to go next. I will definitely read more Halo novels.",
