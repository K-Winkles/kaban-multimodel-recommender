Mila at first gives off the impression of being a spoiled child but as time went on you realize that Mila just wanted to live a life she understood and her parent had prepared her for. I was intrigued that the Govenor could see the the attraction or the looks between Krena & Mila but the Govenor was caught up in his own second chance at love.I would have liked to find out why her parents sent her to her uncle, Sleii, and not the known family in France. Hopefully it will be explained later in the series.Looking forward to more!.I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review.",

However, the dramatic action scene near the end of the book was very well done.I enjoyed this book enough to start book 2 almost right after and was thrilled to discover that Book 2 fills in a lot of unanswered questions that I had from this story.",
