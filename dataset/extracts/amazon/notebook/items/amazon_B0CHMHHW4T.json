                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars High quality super smooth paper.",
                "reviewText": "This is a very high quality three subject college ruled notebook. It has a nice durable plastic front cover which has a diagonal pocket on the inside. The pocket looks to be attached fairly well, but it honestly looks like it will eventually fail with excessive use. There is a light weight plastic divider between each of the sections and they have front and back bottom pockets on them as well. These pockets feel a bit stronger so I think they will last longer. The rear cover is a piece of heavy duty cardboard and works well for its purpose.The paper is a bit heavier than your typical cheap notebook paper, but not significantly. Where it does differ is in its smoothness. This is super smooth paper that feels almost glassy. The lines on the paper are all well printed and even. The paper is perforated on the edges and the perforations are done well so the pages tear out well when you want them too.The paper takes pencil well as does ink. Ball points and rollerballs work best and neither of them really feather or bleed through excessively. I did test with my fountain pens and really wet inks do tend to bleed through and feather on the paper, but not like the really cheap 25 cent school supply notebooks you get at the beginning of a school year.All said I'm very impressed with it. It's a very reasonable price for this quality of a notebook.",

                "reviewText": "This 3-subject notebook is quite reliable with its sturdy blue plastic cover that effectively protects notes from moisture. The 150 double-sided, wide-ruled sheets offer ample space for various subjects, and the perforation ensures neat tear-outs. The section dividers with pockets are a handy addition for organizing loose papers. While I appreciate the strong wire binding and high-quality paper, it's worth noting that similar products might be available at a lower price locally. Nonetheless, it's a solid choice for students and personal use.",

The back cover is of a heavyweight non-corrugated cardboard. Despite this, it does have a slight flop-factor, as shown in the last photo. The aqua color of this notebook is pretty.",

I can see these dividers lasting, unlike paper dividers.* The sheets of paper have perforations so that it's easy to tear out pages.Overall, this is an excellent notebook at a very reasonable price.",
