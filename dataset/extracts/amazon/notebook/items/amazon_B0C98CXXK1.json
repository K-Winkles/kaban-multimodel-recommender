                "reviewText": "These three spiral notebooks have pretty \"Garden Blooms\" covers of a heavy card stock. The gold-colored spiral spine has large loops, so the notebook doesn't only lie flat, it can easily do a 360 and concentrate on just one page. If you're keeping a dream journal or if ideas come to you in the middle of the night, this notebook is the right size to keep on your nightstand. And the spiral is big enough to slip in my favorite pen.The height is 8.25 inches and each page is a hair over 5.75 inches. (Size A5 for those in the stationary realm.) The lines are ruled at 5/16 of an inch. Each page has a place to note the date and page number.The 75 pages (2-sided, so 150 pages to write on) are a creamy color, high quality, and of a decent weight. There is a very slight crease at the far edge of every page. The crease makes it easier to fold over the page, maybe to mark a special note, or divide the notebook into sections.There are as many uses for a good-quality, easy to carry notebook as there are people who need to keep track of things, like recipes, gift ideas, party planning, etc. Let me grab my new notebook and make a list...",
