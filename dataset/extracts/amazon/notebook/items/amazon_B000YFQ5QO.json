                "reviewText": "I've been using these spiral for schedules/planners for years now and I really like them. They are comfortable to write on, soft/smooth, and the edges don't cut into my arm/wrist while I'm writing. It does bleed with my gel pen but that's a small price to pay for my comfort. I also prefer the light lines as I like to write all over the place in my spirals and/or draw and these light lines don't get in the way.",

                "reviewText": "I liked the notebook I got; it's very much a quality product. The advertising, however, I found to be deceptive; it shows four notebooks ostensibly to show the \"four different, possible colors\". But it can lead you to believe that you're getting four notebooks instead of one. Please read the fine print before ordering. If you go quickly like I did, you might find yourself feeling a little short changed when your order arrives.",
