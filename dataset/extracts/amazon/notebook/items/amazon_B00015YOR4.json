                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Really enjoy these notebooks",
                "reviewText": "I tend to use a lot of notebooks and I've tried many different types. I recently found a great small one for my daily needs, but as a writer, I needed something larger. Especially when working on something more involved (like a book for example), I always prefer to have the outline written out physically so I can go back to it easily, work on it anywhere, keep organzed, jot down random thoughts, and so on.While I've tried others, none have really fit my needs (or they've been far too expensive for me to even consider), and I always end up going back to the same old convenience store spiral notebooks. The problem with those, as anyone who uses them will know, is the paper itself isn't the best quality, and with all the flipping back and forth I do when working on something, pages will end up ripping, falling out, etc., and it turns into a big mess.Now to this book. First off, the pages are really good quality. The paper is thick and I've been able to use both sides with absolutely no bleed through (using a gel ink rollerball pen). Using the same pen with other notebooks, there's no way I could use both sides of the paper and still be able to clearly read it.Another aspect I love about this is the hard cover. It's very sturdy and does a great job of protecting the book, making it even easier to carry around and use anywhere. I tried bending the book around the way you would with a spiral notebook if you were to work on only one page. I was able to, although I probably wouldn't suggest it because I assume it would wear out a lot quicker and weaken the backing. (I did notice the same company offers spirals. I haven't tried those yet but do intend to at some point).There are a few little extras that don't really influence how useful I find the notebook, but are nice to have. A ribbon to use for a bookmark, a date planner and table of contents area in the front, and a few maps in the back.I'm very satisfied with this book and glad I ordered two. I've already been using it to work on something on an almost daily basis, and have no complaints yet. Even better is the affordable price compared to some of the other better quality options available. I definitely intend to continue using these books and will likely try out a few others from this company in the future.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great journal -- size of standard paper",
                "reviewText": "I have kept journals for years, and I am picky about the size of the journal. I like the pages to be about the size of a regular piece of paper (8.5 x 11), so that I can tape in papers that are important or want to remember or whatever. I can't use smaller journals, of course, because they're too small to fit a piece of paper inside.I'd been buying my journals at Borders Bookstore. (I don't know if that store even exists anymore!) I bought all of these plain, cloth-covered journals that were just basic lined pages. They were great: they each had about 200 sheets and I could usually find them on sale for under $7. Well, years ago I saw they were clearing out their stock, so I bought all of their remaining journals on the shelves (at a great clearance price!).I'm finally about to run out of that supply of journals, and I've been shopping around for a while to find a new journal that I can start using. I wanted it to be about letter-size, and relatively cheap. I mean, it's just a blank book! I don't want something for professional use, just something to write in!I think this one will fit the bill. It's got nice thick covers and my test of the pages shows that my fountain pen won't bleed through the pages. Also, the price is good.It's certainly not the best looking journal. I don't think it would be appropriate in a professional setting, unless you're just using it for yourself, and not taking it around with you to meetings and such.OVERALL: Good, solid journal. Based on my shopping & comparing lots of different journals of comparable size, it's the best value. And -- the essential for any kind of journal or notebook -- your pen probably won't bleed.",

                "reviewText": "I've used a few different journals now, but this is going to be the one for a while.It has a thicker, better quality paper than the Blueline journals do - not a huge problem if you are using a ball-point pen, but this works so much better with fountain pens and strikethrough/ghosting.I don't mind the quotes too much like I see some complaining of, but the overall interior design should be cleaned up and dressed down a little and the quotes could really go, but the paper makes up for it, IMO. It IS a little off-putting if you are depressed and see the quotes, though. Like you are just trying to make it through the morning or day and here you go with Edison & Franklin. That part isn't great. NEVER GIVE UP written in a kind of desperate scrawled font that is trying to be dynamic and punchy is weird as well on the first page.If you are a stickler for number of pages, these guys are all over the place. The first batch I got was 192 pages - 96 writable sheets - but the current batch is 200 (100 double sided pages). I'd prefer 300/150 or more, so it is fine with me, but if you get used to numbering them and keeping track of daily writing, the surprise can be a little jarring.I think the only real downside for me is that the printed lines are just a little too wide - not college ruled - and that tends to make my writing sprawl. I don't love that.But good solid notebooks for the price.",
