                "reviewText": "I am an adamant believer that you get what you pay for, and in this case I wanted a quality notebook. This (computational) notebook certainly meets that requirement. You might ask why pay (around) $8 for a notebook, especially in this digital age. Well, that engineering sketch, that graphic rendition, lab result, college note-taking, and many other things just don't transfer to a phone as readily. There's still a need to write, and a need to keep something on paper for a while.That said, if you're reading this, you already known that \"National Brand\" supplied these to the US Government for many years, part number \"43-648.\" I compared my new notebook from Amazon to one from the 80's (yes, they hold up that well.) The paper weight remains the same. The blue rulering is much darker than my original. Two *bold blue* lines run horizontally across the top. Another runs vertically 1.25 inches on the left (even pages) and 1.25 inches along the right (for odd pages). This exactly matches the original. And of course, *fine pitched* lines run across the whole page. Some may feel the darker color might interfere with their writing (maybe my original faded?) Both are still 75 pages. The white printed label is a little different, but highly reminiscent of the original. I know this is nominal, but the overall look and feel (quality) remains the same.While the overall size 11.75 x 9.25 inches remains the same, there is one significant difference: The newer notebooks have pointed corners on the right edge. The original had beveled edges (you can see this in the Amazon photo.) Not sure how well the pointed edge will hold up over time. Last, the notebook is now \"Made in Mexico\", and no longer by Dennison National Company of Holyoke MA.I highly recommend this notebook for those who document things a long time.",
