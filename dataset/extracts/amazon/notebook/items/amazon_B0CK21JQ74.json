                "reviewText": "It's pretty - the page layout is alright - the covers are strong. The spiral ring in the center is strong but it;s also HUGE for a left handed person. I don't do the wrap around the top left hand writing the way some people do but that means my palm is quickly at the binder which i feel is annoying. So then i try to pick it up and write on one page - but that doesnt' work because then i am flipping the book during client meetings instead of giving it my main focus. Maybe it's just about being left handed? Not sure - great idea - a lay flat would be a million times more valuable.",
