                "reviewText": "I bought this notebook specially for the QuickNotes area at the bottom, which I find to be very useful. This notebook, while slightly pricey (the price on Amazon is cheaper than at office supplies stores) has seriously boosted my personal productivity ever since I started using it. So I consider the price to be well-worth it. Here's how I take advantage of the yellow area at the bottom:Whenever I start a new project, I'll date and write the title of the project across the top of the page. I use the white portion to write down all my thoughts and notes related to a project. When I reach the end of the page, I'll use the yellow QuickNotes area to:1) Summarize the most important points / ideas on that page (I limit this to the MOST important takeaway or the best idea)2) Identify certain action items that I can take right now to move the project forwardI then \"carry forward\" these key points / good ideas to a new page in the notebook and repeat the process. What I find after using this process is that it allows me to move forward with my work / personal projects very quickly. I am also able to pick up on projects right where I left off by looking at what I've previously written in the QuickNotes area.As I have several projects ongoing at once, I use the same notebook to keep track of all of them. I like having one place for all the notes in my life, whereas previously I had scraps of paper everywhere, Each project spans across several pages (albeit not continuously). That's why I use the same title across the top of each page to identify each project, and use running page numbers to keep track of the order.I like the perforations on each page. They allow me to tear out and discard pages with nothing useful on them. I also plan to tear out all pages related to a project at then file them away at some later date. If you do this, be sure to devote both sides of a page to the same project.Note that if you use a felt-tip pen, the writing is going to show through. I mostly use a ballpoint pen so no issues there.",
