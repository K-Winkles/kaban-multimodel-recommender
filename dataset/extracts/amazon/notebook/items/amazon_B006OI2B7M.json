                "reviewText": "Here's a side-by-side overview of this Oxford Greentint narrow ruled 8\" X 5\" notebook and a similar National brand one:- The overall dimensions are the about the same, except this Oxford is 1/4\" taller.- The Oxford's cover boards are thicker and stiffer. The National's covers are thinner, but a little smoother and the inside surfaces are coated.- The paper weight is about the same, which is lightweight. Testing with a Uni-ball Deluxe Micro black pen, the Oxford's paper seemed to show slightly less soak-through.- The Oxford paper is a slightly lighter shade of green than the National.- Being spiral bound, both brands will fold back and lay flat.- The holes for the spiral wire binding are round in the Oxford, slightly oval in the National. The National has 31 holes, the Oxford has 32. Did you need to know that? Probably not, but I counted them anyway because why not.- Both brands have 80 sheets.- Both brands have the same number of lines, and the lines (narrow ruled) are spaced the same (1/4-inch). Most of the 1/4-inch extra height in the Oxford goes toward a slightly taller top margin. The Oxford's lines are finer and a bit lighter in color.- The Oxford says made in USA by TOPS products. The National says Rediform Inc., and made in Brazil.- At this writing, the National is a little more expensive.The listing title says \"Ampad\" (which is also a TOPS brand), but the picture shows \"Oxford\" brand, and that's what I received. If you search \"Oxford green tint notebook,\" this listing won't appear in the results. This listing is actually kind of hard to find no matter what search terms you use. I think I found it through \"customers also viewed\" on another product listing.",

Some notebooks are too small to write anything substantial and some are just too large to carry around. This one is absolutely perfect! I plan on making this is a regular purchase as soon as I fill up the pages.",
