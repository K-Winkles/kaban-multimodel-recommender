                "reviewText": "The notebook does have dotted pages which I like. However, the paper is thin, and I think most markers would bleed through it. Pages themselves are removable since it\u2019s spiral bound. I don\u2019t care for the colors of the notebooks. The pastel color is like a baby pastel, not a regular pastel color. There are tabs that can be stuck on the page of your choosing. For each notebook, there is an elastic that the customer has to insert in the holes in the back of the book. This elastic helps the pages not be bent. I just can\u2019t figure out why the elastic wasn\u2019t installed at the factory!",
