This notebook is so beautifully made. I\u2019m impressed with the canvas feel cover, definitely wasn\u2019t expecting that. Love the pocket inside and the thickness of the paper. Overall I am extremely pleased with the purchase.We\u2019ve had an immense amount of rain this week so my package was soaked. I tried to be as careful as possible opening and not getting the notebook wet. I found it wrapped in plastic so a majority of the notebook was fine, except for a teeny drop of water that must have escaped when I opened it and got onto one of the corners causing the front and back pieces to separate. I dried it as best I could with my hair dryer and used a tiny bit of E6000 to glue it back together. You wouldn\u2019t know looking at it but I do advise being very careful around liquids.Im already looking at next years calendar as I normally purchase my desk calendars from Target but the quality of work is unmatched. I will be repurchasing from seller in the future.",

The cover page is thick, almost like a canvas and the pages are thick as well which means my notes don\u2019t bleed through to the following page. There was even a note tucked into it with a photo of the family who creates these books. I thought that was so nice. When I\u2019m finished with this notebook I\u2019ll definitely be checking out their other options and buying from them again.",
