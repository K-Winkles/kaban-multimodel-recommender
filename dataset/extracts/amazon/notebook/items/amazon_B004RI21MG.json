He's quite outspoken in his opinions, which are very political, and I can understand why he is not well known in this country, since he has some very unpleasant things to say about US politics.",

                "reviewText": "You would think that this book was writen by a man in his prime, so vivid is the prose, so fresh the ideas, so vibrant the writer's voice urging the youth to abandon their passive attitude and use their fervour and flame to change the world! Indeed, Saramago remained active to the end, a spokesman for human rights, unwavering in his beliefs and uncompromising in his stance. This book is what it claims to be, namely a notebook, a type of diary where Saramago writes his thoughts about events which made an impression on him, much of which expresses his political views on events and politicians. He describes G.W.Bush as being abysmally ignorant...veering towards the absurd. He does not mince his words when it comes to expressing his opinions and talks about people and topics many would regard as controversial. There are about 150 separate topics listed according to date, starting from September 2008 and ending in March 2009.Although he was left wing he does not hesitate to critisize the left, saying they have no idea where they are actually heading. In his unique way he tackles varied topics, from religion and the Catholic Church to people he respects and admires like Rosa Parks. He expresses his hopes and aspirations for president Obama, analyzes the Palestinian situation and even gives a \"recipe\" on how to kill a man. It is a short concise book whose content is lucid and succinct. Irrespective of your own feelings about the issues he deals with in his book, his brilliance as well as his alertness of mind make this book invaluable reading. I can but feel gratitude for such thinkers who help broaden my own spectrum of thought.",

                "reviewText": "In his late eighties and near the end of his life, Jos\u00e9 Saramago, the Portuguese Nobel Prize winning writer and political activist, wrote a blog in which he made comments and observations on a broad range of political, economic, social, cultural and philosophical topics. These were interspersed with personal recollections and elegant eulogies for those he most respected. Whether writing on religion, the US presidency, democracy, the financial crisis or neo-liberalism, his words simply drip with indignation and anger. Although his writings predated them by just a few years, he was clearly writing for the young indignados in Spain and elsewhere who are now wakening up to the barbarity of the world we live in today.",
