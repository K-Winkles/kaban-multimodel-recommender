Very little ghosting and only sharpies bleed through. (I don\u2019t have a fountain pen to test though). Pencil erases cleanly and easily.The grid is not too dark so is not distracting.I already had the stencils from a stencil set I purchased earlier. But they\u2019re nice stencils.2 ribbon bookmarks, a back pocket, and an elastic band make this excellent for journaling.The only things I would add are a few dedicated index pages and a small section of perforated pages.But, so far I absolutely love these journals and I will absolutely buy more. They feel so nice in my hands!",

                "reviewText": "These are GREAT for the price. My only minor quibble is that the combination of the cover elastic and the bubble mailer meant that my corners were a bit dented upon arrival. It wasn't bad and certainly not a dealbreaker at this price point, but they'd benefit from a sheet of cardboard put between the cover and the paper.Mine had free journal stencils tucked into the back pocket, which was a nice and thoughtful surprise.I am a minimalist bujo person. I mostly use my books for making two-page calendar spreads and a LOT of daily todo lists. I've tried a lot of notebooks - Moleskine (paper too thin), Leuchterm (thin paper, hard cover doesn't lie flat), Midori/TN (so narrow!), Nuuna (Amazing but $$$). I had been looking at Hobonichi for this year but I'm a student and trying to save money. These books really impressed me, especially for the cost.The soft covers on these feel sturdy enough and the pages are sewn in. The book lies flat when opened - you don't need to hold it down to write in it. There are two bookmark ribbons in matching colors and a sturdy pocket in the back cover.The paper seems good for my purposes. I usually use uniball, gelly roll, and brush pens. It feels smooth.The dot grid is 5mm. I actually prefer a slightly smaller grid but I think I'm in the minority there. Most places do 5mm so this is perfectly standard and a good size for most handwriting.You absolutely cannot beat the price. And I like that it's split in two volumes because this makes it lighter to carry and also gives me a fresh start in a few months when I fill the first one.A two-page calendar comes up with about nine lines per box - plenty of space to plan. And I have room on each page to make two good size columns for list keeping.All in all, these are amazing and I will probably buy more.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these bullet journals to document my medical journey + chemotherapy regimen and they\u2019ve been a tremendous help. The paper is thick so no bleed through with multiple inky pens. I scribble in squares and no bleed through! Paper is smooth and I love the covers. I went with this because I like moleskin but the price point is too much for me to justify with how much I write. These are a great bang for your buck. Ordering two more but with lined paper instead I think for everyday journaling.The only complaint is how they\u2019re shipped. Some pages came slightly bent in the corner because they\u2019re shipped in a bag and I\u2019m sure they get bumped through transport. Not worth docking a star for because the journals are still usable. Just something to be mindful of. Hoping the next two have no issues! Love the green!",
