I'm not joking - this checks every box for what I was looking for: something sturdy, something large, something with dividers, something aesthetically pleasing.I use one notebook for all of my classes each semester at college, and carry this thing everywhere. Needless to say, it gets a lot of use and abuse. This thing held up incredibly well. The perforated pages are useful, but strong enough that they won't fall off when you're just using the pages. Thick paper that doesn't show through, even when using gel or thick pens. The dividers are useful but don't warp or break down over time like other journals I've used.Great purchase - I'll be getting another one again this year.",

If they made this in brown, gray, a forest or moss green, navy blue I\u2019d buy a bunch!",

I love pink so this is perfect and it's like your average 5 star school notebook, with 8.5x11 sized and lined pages, just no hole punched holes. It does have a yellow tint though, for the pages just in case you're not a fan of yellow rather than white pages. I definitely will be getting more for future school years.",
