                "reviewText": "First things first, the Rocketbook is like no other notebook out there. It combines the best of both worlds: the joy of scribbling on paper and the convenience of going digital. With its reusable pages, I can jot down my lecture notes, doodle my heart out, and then simply wipe it clean with a damp cloth. No more wasting paper or money on countless notebooks!But here's where it gets even better. The Rocketbook comes with a nifty smartphone app that takes your note-taking experience to a whole new level. Just snap a picture of your handwritten notes using the app, and boom! It magically saves them to your favorite cloud services like Google Drive or Dropbox. Say goodbye to losing your precious notes or struggling to find them buried in stacks of paper.One feature that blew my mind is the smart page detection. The app recognizes the pages of your Rocketbook automatically, ensuring that your scanned notes are perfectly aligned and organized. No more flipping through pages or dealing with messy files.And let's talk about organization, my friends. The Rocketbook app lets you assign different symbols or icons to specific destinations like email or cloud storage. So now, with just a simple mark on your page, you can send your notes exactly where they need to go. It's like having a personal assistant organizing your stuff!Now, let's address some concerns. Yes, the Rocketbook has a limited page count, but honestly, it's a small trade-off for all the benefits it offers. Plus, erasing ink can sometimes be tricky depending on the type you use, but hey, a little ghosting won't stop me from enjoying this fantastic notebook.This is a game-changer. It's perfect for taking class notes, brainstorming ideas, or sketching out those brilliant doodles during boring lectures. And let's not forget professionals and creatives who crave that tactile writing experience while still needing the convenience of going digital.In conclusion, if you're tired of traditional notebooks and want to level up your note-taking game, the Rocketbook is the way to go. It's different, it's better, and it's a total lifesaver for students like you and me. Don't miss out on this gem!Rating: 5 out of 5 stars \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50",

                "reviewText": "As a college student, I go through a LOT of notebooks. I typically buy 4-6 3-subject notebooks every 5 months, that I completely use in that time. I was getting tired of buying so many so often, and lugging around several pounds of notebooks is not fun. I did a lot of digging before deciding that the Rocketbook would be the reusable notebook I'd try out and so far, I do love it!I have been using my Rocketbook for a little over a month now and I have had very little trouble with it. Writing in it was a quick adjustment because it feels much smoother than paper, but it still feels nice to write on. Erasing has not caused any damage to the pages, but you do have to wipe away the area you erased with your finger similar to wiping away pencil shavings, or the pen doesn't write as nicely. I typically fill up all the pages each week, and then on the weekend, I spend 20-30 minutes getting all of my notes onto the app (which is super quick and easy to use) and wiping all of the pages off with a cloth or paper towel.My only major complaint is that the cover is very easily scratched, which is why the front of mine is now covered in stickers. You can really see the scratches on the back cover, though. This is after a little over a month of normal use in a college setting. The cover hasn't really seemed to get truly damaged, but it definitely doesn't look nearly as nice with all the scratches on it. But adding stickers did personalize it a bit, so that's not really a big thing to worry about in my opinion.The pens do seem to run out of ink pretty quickly, but that is not really a Rocketbook problem and is more a Pilot problem. One month of daily use put my first one out of commission and I had to buy refills, but that's a small price to pay compared to buying 12 notebooks every 10 months.Pros:-One notebook for all 5 of my classes, 4 clubs, and other extracurricular activities-Access to all of my notes quickly and easily on Google Drive or on the Rocketbook app-Better for the environment in terms of cutting down trees (not sure about how recyclable the notebooks are though)-App is super easy to use and runs smoothlyCons:-Cover is easily scratched-Pens run out of ink quicklySome things I would love to see from Rocketbook:-Being able to add more pages to a file that's already been uploaded via the appThere have been numerous times that I take notes on a chapter in class and upload them, but then decide next class that I would have liked to add another page onto the document. It'd be cool if you could edit them after uploading them through the app-More pages in the book itselfNot too many more, because then it would take me much longer to go through it over the weekend, but maybe making a 50 page one would be awesome!-College ruled lined pages, maybe a calendar page in the front or backWhile the dots do help me write straight, sometimes my writing just doesn't line up right, so having lined pages would definitely make my notes look nicer once uploaded. I also would love to see a calendar as either the first or last page in the book. I have a busy schedule and being able to jot down notes for the month right there in class in the same notebook would definitely help me out. I've made my own monthly calendar on the last page of mine, but having a page already structured would be awesome so I don't have to remake it every month or extremely carefully erase the writing while leaving the outline.Overall, I definitely recommend the Rocketbook to college students looking for a simpler and cheaper way to take notes, or anyone else really. While it does have some minor issues, there are no major problems and it is so much nicer carrying around one single notebook to all of my classes.",

LO RECOMIENDO como producto econ\u00f3mico y sustituto de los anteriores.Llevo con el m\u00e1s de 3 a\u00f1os y no e tenido que comprar ningun otro tipo de libreta para hacer anotaciones y la invercion m\u00e1s necesaria que tendr\u00e1s en las plumas marca FRIXION como unos $250MX 3 piezas semestrales. Soy estudiante universitario y hago anotaciones hasta morir por eso no me duran m\u00e1s de 6 meses jaja.Sin embargo el cuaderno no tiene problemas con el escaneo (usando la app de Roketbook) puedes escanear tu apunte cas\u00ed desde cualquier angulo, iluminaci\u00f3n, fondo, etc.Tuve problemas con que la pluma no pinta lineas cont\u00ednuas. Si haces una l\u00ednea de 10 cent\u00edmetros el entre un 20% a un 60% tu l\u00ednea estar\u00e1 completa (osea sin que se borre a la mitado o deje espacios consecutivos) y es uno en un millon que logres hacer una l\u00ednea 100% completa, \u00a1Eso me desespera!Y ten cuidado si tienes jugos o le metes papeles pintados porque si ven en una de mis fotos SE MANCHA CON FACILIDAD y la hoja del principio y del final siempre se te van a manchar (Experiencia tengo 2 de estos cuadernos).Y TEN CUIDADO CUANDO BORRES! Las hojas se doblan horrible, llevaras el trauma y la decepci\u00f3n siempre que veas esa arruga NO SE DESDOBLA CON FACILIDAD y si lo logras queda la marca por siempre :,).PERO! Recomiendo el cuaderno. Para notas r\u00e1pidas y sobre todo en el trabajo es muy c\u00f3modo, no pesa casi n\u00e1da hasta a veces olvidas que lo llevas, acuerdate de el que es f\u00e1cil de perder, no me a pasado pero a conocidos m\u00edos si.",
