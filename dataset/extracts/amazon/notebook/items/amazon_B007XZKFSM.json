                "reviewText": "So why would a blank notebook deserve a review. Let alone why would a blank notebook deserve a 5 star review.I go through some 20 of these a year myself and the classes that we teach at a vocational program uses some 300 a year.So, I have ordered these products from other brands and there have been some quality issues. Here is where and why I continue to buy these.Our students are transient, some are homeless, some have a hard existence. the classes range from culinary to construction to high school to computers. These note books often get folded in half and stuck in a back pocket or tucked in the fold of a cooking class apron.The front and back covers are pretty tough and survive being bent. The spine is equally tough. The books get twisted back so they lay flat and the spines cracked in the process and they hold up well.The machines that fold and bind these pages do a good job. Some of our orders from other cheaper brands have pages cut near the spine. This makes for odd opening of the book and the pages twisted when open so writing becomes skewed. Very good consistent quality.Yes you can order notebooks with as many or even MORE pages. We ordered a batch that had 50 more pages from another brand. The paper was so thin I thought I was looking at the onion paper my parents used in Post WWII Europe to save on Air Mail Postage. They also bled and tore easily. The lined portion was thin and light.The page thickness and durability is very good and consistent. Yes you can buy notebooks with thicker pages and beautiful deep colored lines....but not at this price range. The students are often rushed and some are heavy handed. Some write so hard that they literally tattoo the word through the page to other side like braille. It is the mark of a good quality paper that can handle that consistently and does not tear.Many of our students use packing tape across cover for use in their wet culinary class and for the construction class. This makes the notebooks near indestructible.Quality makes all the difference",

                "reviewText": "Pros:- This is an affordable when you compare the price per quantity (12 for $20)Cons:- Would not recommend if you plan to keep the notes/records for long term use.Back of the book eventually falls off than the binding comes apart. Not happy as I use notebooks frequently for keeping track of important records.- Since the binding is with the cover, if you fold the cover - the cover rips and the binding become loose. Eventually the entire book comes apart. Terrible for long term use.",
