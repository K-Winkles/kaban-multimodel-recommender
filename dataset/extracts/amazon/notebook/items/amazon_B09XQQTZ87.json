The pink and white notebooks had spirals that ripped the pages too. The quality of the notebooks is really good; the paper is very nice and thick, nothing is loose, everything as expected. The notebooks are lightweight and exactly as pictured. The only compalint is the way they were packaged. There was no wrapping or a buffer between the product and the box it came in. I had to return, but I am definitely reordering!",

There is frequent opening and wrapping front to back to enable the notebook easier to use while standing. Unlike typical spiral binders, the pages are of heavier weight, ink does not bleed through the underside of the page and pages do not indiscriminately tear out o the binder. The cover is a heavier material with a cord wrap to secure closure. Best spiral notebook for my purposes!",

I am tempted to buy a whole bunch before they become priced at what they are worth.To start off, I am a horrid paper snob and also spend a large portion of my day writing, doodling, listing, pretending to be working, etc. on paper. However, being a paper snob/el-cheapo, I have found it difficult to find \"Archer & Olive\" quality at dollar store prices... Until now!If my house was clean-ish, I would totally take pictures to go alongside this post. Because I love the semi-transparent cover, which allows one to create a really lovely cover page for their notebook. Also, no stress if ya' screw it up because you can just take that page out! Whoop whoop.The pages are nice and thick, none of my drawings have ghosted. I am unsure about paints, but I have high hopes, based on how the paper has responded to the markers and pens tried thus far.I am definitely purchasing another set of these as soon as I finish this post.",
