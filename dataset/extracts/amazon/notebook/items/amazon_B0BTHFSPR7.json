I have put this thing through the wringer for different markers and creating different spreads including a bunch of Dutch doors and it is holding up great! I have had big name journals have very loos pages after making large sections of Dutch doors and this notebook is putting them to shame.If you are looking to start bullet journaling this is a great journal to start out with and even if you are not new it\u2019s a great affordable option!",

                "reviewText": "with my last journal being a paperage one, i decided to try this one out solely because i liked the colors more. i'm having a blast, but for a weirdly specific reason, i think i'm gonna end up going back to paperage for my next journal.the cover is a harder plastic as opposed to a pleather sort of deal, which isn't inherently an issue, but i tend to paste clippings on the outside of my journals, and i've been sealing them in with packing tape. the packing tape came up around the edges on this one unless i taped the ENTIRE cover, which i did, but it wasn't convenient. but this is a very specific problem for a person to have so i'm not holding it against the journal.i love the pen loop a lot, and the journal has been pretty sturdy for the pricepoint. it's string bound or whatever (i forget the word but the pages are sewn together which is sturdier than glue), and the paper is certainly thick. i don't remember if it's acid free or not which is also pretty important for archival purposes if that matters to you.anyways, i wouldn't be opposed to buying another of these if the color REALLY spoke to me, but as a chronic Gluer And Paster Of Images, i don't think i would've bought it if i knew the cover was gonna be such an adhesive repellant plastic, similar to the kind those moving holographic bookmarks are made out of. i haven't seen one of those in stores forever actually. anyways i'm gonna go now thanks hope this was helpful bye",
