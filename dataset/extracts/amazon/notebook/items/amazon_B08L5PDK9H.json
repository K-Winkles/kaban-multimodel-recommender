I have had to use spiral notebooks while WFH this past year, so I have tried several brands from the local sources. Finding a made in USA spiral notebook is nearly impossible, so at least these are made in the West. The paper is smooth and calendered and the line ink is water-resistant, unlike the cheapo brands. A casual spill of liquid will run off the paper. The microperf edge is clean, just hold the spiral side down as you gently pull. My only wish for this is that could be available with a hard back to support it while in an airline seat or at a crowded desk..",

                "reviewText": "Ever since high school, I've used spiral-bound notebooks for all my notes. Even as a physician, I perform the vast majority of my note-writing in spiral notebooks. The trick is finding the right one. Each of the three notebooks provided in this set is identical but for the cover color - red, white, or blue. The notebooks are designed in France, made in Spain, and each one has 70 sheets. The pages have a bright white appearance with sharp red margin and blue horizontal lines. As one reviewer noted, Sharpies will bleed through - I don't know any paper that will resist a Sharpie - but everything else works just fine. The pages can be torn off along micro-perforated edges just short of the spiral. And there's the Hamelin app that allows use of Scribzee and permits word-searching within your written notes. (I use that app on my iPhone and it works quite well). I've been using Hamelin notebooks routinely for a few years now, and my only nitpicking point on these notebooks is that their covers are not quite as sturdy as I like. Every so often, I'll want to write in a notebook without having a firm surface available, so I hold the notebook in one hand while writing with the other. Here, the cover is thin enough that the notebook bends just a bit, even with all the pages in place. It's not a big deal, and I imagine this won't bother the vast majority of people (who might actually appreciate this notebook being a bit lighter in the backpack).",

                "reviewText": "So these are really nice notebooks if you plan to use the ScribZee app. There are corners on the edge of each page which are mandatory for using the app and you can't just use any notebook. The paper of these notebooks is nice and thick and is fun to write on because it's creamy and substantial, and the pen does not easily show through on the other side. The four squares in every corner are kind of annoying in my opinion but if you really want to use the scribzee app you have to get used to that.I know this is a review for the notebooks and not the ScribZee app, but I downloaded the app to try it with this notebook and I personally was not terribly impressed. It only allows you to search the title of your note pages and not your handwritten notes themselves. But if you want to wait to scan your notes to keep them on your phone then you need a notebook like this to use that app to do it.If you're not using the app, then I would not recommend these notebooks because of the four marks in the corner of each page because I find them ugly and distracting. But if you are using the app, this is otherwise a very nice set of notebooks.",

                "reviewText": "What I use these for is to organize areas in the closets, garage and under bed. I make lists of what is in each box so I can reach the items I need without searching through a bunch of them first. For instance, when the grandchildren come to visit, I have all their things in one place--but in several boxes. I select which box goes to which child, according to what's in the list. Easy peasy! There are so many uses for these handy notebooks, you could spend the day listing them. LOL.",
