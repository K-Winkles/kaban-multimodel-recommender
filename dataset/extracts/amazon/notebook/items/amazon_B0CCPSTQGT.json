It is no secret that kids can be hard on things, especially when it comes to school stuff. Her backpack gets thrown around and tossed every which way as does its contents. I know this journal has taken a beating this year and it has held up surprisingly well.She likes that it is easy for her to write in when she needs to. She recently asked for another one because she has run out of room in her first book. This tells me she is happy with it.Recommended.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the ENVO Composition Notebooks for my kindergartner, and I must say, they are an absolute winner! As a parent, finding the right school supplies that cater to both quality and style is always a priority, and these composition notebooks hit the mark perfectly.The black marble covers give the notebooks a sleek and sophisticated look that my little one absolutely adores. The wide-ruled pages inside are perfect for young learners who are just starting to master their handwriting skills. The generous 100-sheet count in each notebook ensures that there's plenty of space for my child to practice their writing and drawing without feeling restricted.What I appreciate most about these notebooks is their durability.

They've become a place for creativity, writing practice, and a tangible record of my child's progress as they journey through school.In short, the ENVO Composition Notebooks are the perfect companions for young learners embarking on their educational journey.
