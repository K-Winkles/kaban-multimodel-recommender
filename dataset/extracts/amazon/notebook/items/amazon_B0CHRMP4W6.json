                "reviewText": "I ordered this journal in green and while I thought it looked a little bigger, in the photo of it on Amazon, I fell in love with it- when I found out that everything about it is so functional.I love the feel of the cover, and surprisingly, there is an elastic loop for a pen and it works! And I mean well. The pen that I put there, fit well (and, it seemed to me like all types of pens will probably fit there) and stayed on while I toted it about- all day. Even when thrown into a big work bag of mine the pen stayed there, which is nice, because I always know exactly where a pen is in my bag (in my new green journal) and don't have to go fishing around for one. Also, when I want to write in this journal I have the knowledge that no pen is needed. I don't know how many times in my life I have put a journal down when I haven't been able to find a pen or one wasn't conveniently around (and I didn't want to go look). Because I got through pens like crazy and can never have enough around\u2026.but it can be hard to find them!I love the tab stickers that are included because I planned on using this journal as another reading one (I have a few). So each time I start a new book, I can tab the page with the stickers included and mark where that page is, so that I can easily get to it. There is the general ribbon within the book to mark your page (which is in most journals), but if you plan on using this journal for different topics, subjects, books, or any information that you will need to find again- included are a dozen tab markers (stickers).There are also eight stickers that you can use on the front of the journal or on the inside, to inscribe your name or a title on it. Each is a different color and though you probably will only use one, you are given a selection of colors. And any you don't use you can save to use on one of the many journals that don't give you these extras. Even as simple as they are, they are nice to have and aren't normally found when you purchase a journal.Please take a look at my photos to see some of the reasons why I gave this journal the five stars that I did. In comparison to the many other journals I have ever used in my life, this journal is in the top five (of around 125). Even if I were to consider the much more expensive ones I have had, the manufacturer of this journal made a great product, along with considering the little things that end up mattering a lot- and included a place for a pen, tab and inscription stickers, along with an elastic band to keep it closed- which also helps it to stay in better shape (especially if you're like me, and often throw it in a work bag or purse, to take with you.Thank you- I hope to have helped aid you in your decision",

                "reviewText": "This journal is made with a nice quality to it. It's about the size of a standard printer piece of paper. Nice and big to hold a lot of notes. It's different in the fact that it has a little spot at the top of each page to Mark whether the weather was sunny rainy or cloudy and the day of the week and then on the other side of the page you can mark the date and put a memo number if you have one. I thought the little addition they included about the weather was something different and a nice touch. It has a nice elastic to hold it closed and a nice elastic to keep a pen with it at all times so you're not stuck without a pen, if you lose them all the time like some people I know. It's a nice deep black color and even with some use and rubbing on other objects, the black isn't coming off or fading, so that's nice. There's an inside pocket in the back of the book that has nice little page tabs to Mark important events and to hold important documents. The folder is made out of a nice quality to actually hold quite a bit of stuff and not fall apart easily. Item comes as described and I would highly recommend this item!",

                "reviewText": "So the good: The vegan leather feels nice and the journal is well constructed overall. The pocket in the back is a nice touch. The clasp and pen holder function properly and the overall package looks nice once you give it a night or two to find its form after unpacking (more on that later).The bad: The pages feel thin and I don't love the texture. They hold ink properly, but if you are writing with a ballpoint pen there will be an indentation on the following page even if you are writing very lightly.Would have been bad but turned out fine: When the notebook first arrived I thought it looked bent. After removing the included sticker packs from the back it went back to looking normal after a day or so.It is not lost on me that this is roughly half the cost of more premium journals of similar design, so I am taking that price difference into account in my rating. I feel like you are getting a good looking, functional journal that is a little bit rough around the edges. If you aren't someone who obsesses over the qualities of paper you write on you may never notice the difference between this notebook and a higher end option.",

So this is how I justify having more notebooks.This one is cute - the description says leather but it feels very smooth to me. I would not mistaken it for leather but maybe it is. The color is nice, though, and the bookmark and cover elastic match well. Like a muted cotton candy pink.The paper is nice and sturdy and it opens flat. The only complaint I have is the pocket in the rear. I can't use pockets sensibly - either I don't use it or I cram as much as I can into it. This one, I won't have an option to cram. It's mostly paper with a reinforced gusset but I think it'll come apart if tested. It came with some cute stickers that are very bright.I think this would be super cute as part of a gift with some nice gel pens or something. Like a little journaling kit.",
