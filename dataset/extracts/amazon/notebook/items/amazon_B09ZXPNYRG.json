                "reviewText": "I have always loved Rocketbook notebooks since they first came out with the Wave in 2015. I lost the Wave I had back then and kind of forgot about them until just recently and wow! Their options are amazing! The app has come a long way since the last time I downloaded it.PROS: - Truly reusable with very helpful subject dividers (that you can move and place wherever you need them!) - Works with all of the Frixion pens, markers, and highlighters I've bought - Pen that it comes with actually works, unlike some other notebooks I've bought that come with a pen that are bone dry by the time they get to me - The app allows you to choose folders to upload your scans into on various online cloud sites like Google Drive, OneDrive, and Dropbox, but it also can go to sites like Evernote, Slack, and an email of your choosing - So far, the OCR feature in the app has been relatively accurate with some exceptions, which is fine. Even Adobe struggles sometimes. I also have oddly spelled names in the story ideas I've written in mine and a lot of very unused words (like ballagarraidh, which is technically Scottish Gaelic) - The app has tutorials built in so you actually know how to use all the features and it has an obvious spot in case you forget how to do something - The ink only takes about 10-15 seconds for it to dry, which is pretty sweetCONS: - I don't recommend using the Frixion highlighters on it. I used it and it smudged the word I was highlighting pretty badly. I rewrote the word to see if that would help, but it just created a pool of ink that didn't dry even though a decent amount of time had passed. - There will come a point that you will not have a clean paper no matter how hard you try to get it all out. It's sucky. I'm hoping this is just a problem with the microfiber cloth needing to be washed so we'll see if that's the case. - You have to buy your own spray bottle. - The microfiber cloth is kinda too big to me. When I try to get a nice, smooth wipe to not get other parts of what I've written on the page, the cloth will just wrinkle on itself and start removing ink in spots that I don't want it to. It is NOT as easy and smooth to wipe all the ink off like they show in the video.Overall, I just love this notebook and am excited to finally have a notebook I can use for classes that doesn't end up filled and unusable and taking up space on my desk shelf like normal notebooks. I definitely recommend getting the pen packs from Frixion, especially the colored ones since it's not a good idea to use the highlighters to emphasize things.",

                "reviewText": "The Rocketbook works great! I own the Core, Fusion Plus, Mini, and Multi-Subject. It works exactly as advertised. When scanning with the app, image quality is as good as your camera will allow. OCR text recognition is as expected... it really relies on handwriting quality and consistent lines (I tend to reduce pen pressure at the end of each letter, so most OCR software struggles with my writing).The dividers in the multi-subject notebook work in the other letter sized notebooks. While the dividers can be removed and replaced many times, I think the tabs that go in the coils could eventually break.The ink erases easily with a dampened towel (use the included towel to protect the page surface).Note: don't press too hard when erasing, otherwise you can end up removing the surface coating. Don't press too hard when writing either.If you experience \"ghosting\" (happens if you leave dark ink on the page for an extended time), a hot, wet towel can remove it.Keep in mind also, the ink is heat sensitive. If you leave the notebook in your car during a hot summer, the ink might disappear. (If this happens, you might be able to recover it by placing it in your freezer).Every notebook comes with a towel and pen. The envelope has a big compartment that holds the notebook and towel. Then a smaller, sealed separately, compartment holds the pen. Any review stating there wasn't a pen likely didn't notice the separate compartment.Note about Frixion writing utensils: the pens work well. I haven't been impressed with the markers.",

                "reviewText": "EDIT: I've been using this rocketbook for school since about January, so it's in use for about 8 months now (spring semester and fall semester). everything was fine during spring but the spiral spine of the book has begun to break at the ends, meaning that the top and bottom parts of the book are no longer being held together, and so things fly out sometimes. I really like rocketbook so I'll continue using it but I find this very disappointing because the spine of my older rocketbook, which I have been using for years before this point, is still in perfect shape, if a little bent, but this rocketbook which I've barely had for a year is already at this point. :(I love this rocketbook. I have another version that has less pages and basically ditched it for this one (though is still use the other one). I use this one for school because of its lined pages. It's very good for taking notes, doing assignments, etc. and I love how you can put headlines and dates and whatnot. Plus, the dividers allowed me to separate by subject AND it had a lot of pages in it, so I could use this whole book for 4-5 classes for an entire semester and never run out of pages before maybe two weeks, after which I'd take an hour to clean all the pages and start again.",
