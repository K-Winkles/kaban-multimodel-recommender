                "reviewText": "I buy dot grid journals for studying and hobby journaling. I prefer a dot grid in case I want to draw quick comic panels or I need to break up a space into smaller chunks of information. Since I have tried a lot of brands, here's how this one compares to my favorite cheap brand to buy on Amazon:- The Cover: This journal's cover is made of a flexible and squishy faux leather with hard covers and a soft spine. It feels and acts like it's more premium than my usual journal, however it came with some dents embedded in the cover, probably from something heavy placed over it for too long. Since I plan to paint onto this cover, it's not an ideal situation. But since it's cheap, this is actually less issues than expected. It's common for me to find weird markings and dents on cheap journals, even if I go to a store in-person.- The Pages: This paper is a soft ivory color that's easy on the eyes. There's 160 total pages - 3 for the index, 1 blank page, and 156 numbered pages. What surprises me is when comparing the 120 GSM page (this journal) to a 100 GSM page (usual journal). While this one is slightly more opaque, the amount of ghosting is about the same. My usual tools are a Tombow marker and a gel pen. All marks and colors will show to the other side, but not so strongly that I can't write over it. However, it does bleed through completely if I press a dot into the paper. You will need to press lightly on your markers. I do not recommend this journal for coloring directly onto the paper, you'll want a 160 GSM journal which can handle ink better. However, I think this paper is fine for general writing or for sketching without color. There's not a big enough difference for me to prefer 120 GSM over 100 GSM.-The Construction: It lays flat. I tugged at the pages, elastic, and ribbons, and I am only concerned about the pen loop, so that part should be handled with some care. This book is pretty lightweight for a hardcover, but slightly heavier than my usual. My main issue is with the opening page. With most journals like this, there is a sheet of cardstock over the seams of the cover sheet. The first page is glued directly onto this cardstock in a way that you can't fully open the page, you have to crease it about a half inch from the spine so it opens flat. Usually, I skip or glue down the page completely so I don't have to crease the page to use it. But in this journal, this page is also an index page. It bothers me to have to use this section, but you might find you don't care. It depends how much the extra index page means to you.- Extras: This journal comes with a pen loop, two ribbons, a title page, three dedicated index pages, 156 numbered pages, a pocket in the back cover, some stencils, and a band to hold the book closed. My usual has much fewer extras. I would say this one is definitely a plus for anyone who wants to dive straight into journaling without having to worry about page numbers or index pages. The stencils are nice if you need to repeatedly use symbols.Overall, I feel this journal is a good competitor to my usual brand for general writing or studying. I personally don't find the pages sturdy enough for coloring with markers.",

If you\u2019re going to get into more heavy pens, markers, and detailed stuff, you will get ghosting. Which is fine if you\u2019re just starting your practice. It\u2019s a great notebook to experiment and get over perfectionism in your journal practice.Go for it! It\u2019s just a notebook and it is yours. Don\u2019t worry about mistakes it\u2019s about what your intentions are, not how pretty or perfect it looks.",

                "reviewText": "I love the sturdy leather covered journal and use it for daily to-do lists among other things, but not necessarily as a \"bullet journal\". The paper is sturdy, smooth, does not bleed through when I doodle while making lists, and it has plenty of pages to last me a long time. I like that the pocket on the inside back cover holds my metal journal rulers and that there are 2 book page markers instead of 1. My only complaint is that one of the two, the front cover has a gouge in the leather that is very noticeable. It kind of detracts from its high-quality leather. Other than that, I would have given it a 5-star rating. I will buy these again for sure.",

                "reviewText": "This journal is as good as the name-brand, high-end journals I've purchased in the past. Paper is great for various ink types, it's smooth, and the overall book has all the features of others. The main things I wanted was dot grid with numbered pages, which can be hard to find without costing a lot more. Plus, you get two journals for less than the price of others.",

The addition of a Content section and numbered pages is great. Though I think the pages are ever so slightly thinner now, it\u2019s not a problem. The page quality is still great, and the binding now feels even more flush. I will forever recommend these journals.",
