                "reviewText": "I love the paper in these notebooks -- my pens seem to glide across the page. The color is a nice cream rather than a stark white, so reading what I've written is also easy on the eyes. There's a small amount of visible bleed-thru when using pens with really dark ink, or when using very wet fountain pens, but it isn't enough to interfere with readability on pages where you've written on both sides. The Kraft cover gives me a nice plain surface to decorate should I decide to, and so far the note I attached to the cover with a glue stick is firmly adhered, which bodes well for collage. A good notebook for bullet journaling since the page size is big enough for long lists or for dividing the page into different sections.",
