It has very good quality paper with clear and consistent lines.With regular pens, even gel point, there is no bleed-through at all. However, there is some bleed with Sharpies and similar markers. It is minimal but does happen.The perforations work pretty well but I sometimes have to crease the paper along the perforation first. Just to ensure a smooth tear out without ripping elsewhere. That is, unfortunately, normal with perforated sheets.",
