I ordered these as the price was good and the paper is thicker than most journals, I hoped they would be ok with fountain pens and pencils, and they are! Lovely quality and several years of note making sorted. It\u2019s also good having them matching, if I had one note - it would be the spiral binding, its a good solid binding that allows the books to open flat and for pages to be removed, but it is large - and might catch on things. Still all up excellent value.",

                "reviewText": "Finding an affordable A4 hardcover notebook was very difficult. Some may have been higher quality, but I didn't want to spend $15+ for one notebook, especially since I needed 4-6 of them.The cover is 2mm thick plastic, it's very sturdy, which is what I wanted.Another feature -- which may be unwanted by some -- is the dots are darker than most dotted grid books, which I wanted since I need new glasses.The amount of sheets was a good amount for me since I'm distributing my notes throughout a bunch of notebooks, so any one doesn't need to be too big.The size is great, it allows me to write in 2 to 4 columns on a single page for lists and other content.As far as paper quality, I haven't used enough paper to speak on the surface quality when it comes to the writing experience. With my OHTO GS01 gel ink pen, there's no bleed, and ghosting was only visible when the page is held up to light individually.One negative I found with the paper is the perforations can come apart a little too easily. This means I've been having to be careful while turning the pages.",

Spiral binding is very solid.",
