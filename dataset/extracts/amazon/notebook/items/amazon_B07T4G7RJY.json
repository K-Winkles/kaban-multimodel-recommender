                "reviewText": "Honestly most of this is on me for not paying enough attention before buying because the information is RIGHT THERE but some things I think could use improvements.Some initial impressions:It is kind of small for an actual laptop. I have a 17\" one and everything feels wobbly and crooked while typing.Like others pointed out, with a laptop of this size the phone holder becomes useless. Not like I could've used it anyway because it holds phones upright instead of at an angle.While I appreciate the turning base it feels kinda useless if you are trying to sit upright at a desk against a wall or cubicle. I would much rather it was easier to move the base around to straighten my set up up and have the base be a lot more steady than have a base that spins on itself and makes it difficult to move around. But again this is a detail I didn't see before purchasing so that's more of a heads up for anyone that works on a desk without moving around much rather than a criticism.The plastic does feel very cheap. From the pictures the whole thing did look a lot sturdier and maybe it was just the texture and design but the actual thing feels like it could break easily. The turning base combined with the cheap plastic just makes me nervous, is it trembling? Am I trembling? Is my desk trembling? Idk.PROS: Well it does hold it up and I can see the screen at a better angle now haha. And I might be able to use it until I find something better I suppose. I don't think it will drop my laptop, at the very least.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Sturdy construction and reasonable price; large issues with balance and phone holder",
                "reviewText": "THE GOOD: The product mostly works well for its intended use. No complaints so far on its actual ability to securely hold my laptop, and the angle options are good. The construction also feels decently solid. The mechanism for holding the laptop in place seems reliable, and I\u2019m not worried that it will ever fall or slip.THE BAD: My first problem lies with the rotating base on the bottom of this product. The ability to spin it around smoothly is a nice little added feature, but not something I really cared about. The issue, however, is that it makes the stand not sit flat on my desk. So when I put even a little bit of pressure on either side, it rocks back and forth in an extremely annoying way. My other major complaint is the terrible placement of the phone holder. The phone is displayed quite far behind and below the laptop. If this wasn\u2019t enough, when I\u2019m using the laptop\u2019s USB port on the left (as I always am with my USB mouse), it completely blocks the phone\u2019s screen. My first picture shows this (HP Elitebook 14\u201d shown in picture, but it also happens with my Acer Aspire 15.6\u201d).BOTTOM LINE: The product mostly works well for its main intended use. If you\u2019ve read this review and don\u2019t think you\u2019d be bothered by the stability issue or the phone holder\u2019s placement, then go ahead and buy it. From my research, the price for this one is good compared to others with similar sturdiness. But in my case, I wish I did a little more research (or spent a little more), because the problems I listed are hard to ignore.",

                "reviewText": "This computer stand is lightweight, easily adjusted, and holds my Chromebook well. As a downside, the arm that swings to the side to hold my smartphone is too narrow to hold my phone with the case protector. I'm not about to remove the case protector when I'm using USB tethering to provide an internet connection from my smartphone. I'll simply set the phone to the side. I like the swiveling feature, which is very convenient. It's a little on the lightweight side, so it rocks very slightly from side to side when I'm typing, but that's not a big deal. Being lightweight makes it easily portable. It does raise my screen up significantly so I don't have to bend my neck down when using it, giving me greater comfort. I'm very satisfied with my purchase.",

I have a HP Elitebook and haven't had to use them but a nice addition regardless. I also like how the support leg clicks into the laptop table then will click into the base lightly so when it's folded its held securely together.
