I love that there is a place to keep a pen always with my journal. I love the strap to close it and the bit to keep track where I am. The paper feels quite nice and will be interesting testing bleed through. I am so excited.Edit: after a bit the stretchy bit broke. It just hangs off now. It doesn't really affect the amazing ness of the book and it still closes and stays closed perfectly. I was a bit sad and disappointed when it happened, but it has been like that for a little bit and it hasn't changed really anything about it. I kinda use it as a way to grab it and pull it to me. \ud83d\ude02",

It has an elastic band to keep the book closed as well as a second one to keep track of which page you are on. the A5 is smallish in size but not too small. All in all, a great notebook. Very pleased.",

But not cheap or plastic feeling. Pages are thick. I've used markers and all different pens with no bleeding. Has elastic for bookmark and another to hold journal closed. Would buy as a gift. When this is filled up, buying again!!!!",

My rub is the binding was held onto the front page. I am not sure if this a production error or if they all are like this. The rear binding appears to be more solid. Thr pages appear to be held together by interlocking stitches and glue. Just the front part seems to have poor binding. I have only had it for a couple of days and I believe contact double-sided tape would fix this right up. I still would buy again unless I stumbled across something cheaper and better bound. It is still a pretty decent product and I like the colors options. This one may just be a fluke.",

And last but not least - so affordable. I can\u2019t stop talking about this journal - just get one or give one!!!",
