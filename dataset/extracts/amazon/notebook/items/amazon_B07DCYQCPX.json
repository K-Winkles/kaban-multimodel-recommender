                "reviewText": "I adore this journal! I've had mine for a month or two and the outside still looks like new! I accidentally ordered two and planned on returning one but Im for sure going to keep both now. I ordered this to use as a book journal, my Micron pens work really well on the durable, thick pages and the color of the pages is beautiful. I like my pages not to be bright white but not too yellow and the color of the pages is a perfect warm creamy color, lines are good size but don't look like something a preschooler would write on and are seeable but don't stand out on the page like a sore thumb. The exterior (I ordered the leather looking one) is nice quality and color is good. Mine has no scratches or showable wear and tear but I haven't been very rough with it and it doesn't go outside of my house much but I imagine you could travel with it or something of that sort and it would hold up just fine. The packaging is nice (there is a thin layer of plastic on the outside of the box it comes in but I dont know what they could have substituted for it and thats expected, other then that the packagings fairly frugal when it comes to plastic) if you are giving it as a gift the box is nice, and there logo is neatly printed on front (it just nice touches and small details that show quality). There's a pocket in the back and a elastic band to secure the journal, I didn't need these but something to keep in mind if your using it in a office or something like that. Binding is great and durable doesn't bend the pages along with it. Believe it or not Im actually not a journal fanatic, when I look for a book journal I just want something thats fairly durable with a decent cover and a nice exterior design since my book journals quickly have become keepsakes, but this journal just had me so EXCITED! It is so lovely and the quality is so NICE and thoughtful, even down to the last details. I also love that Im not buying from China which is probably why the quality is so nice on this journal. I like to consider myself a environmentalist and from my thin layer of research and experience the company seems like it didn't jack up our environment making their products. I'm am really impressed by this product and although I'm not a huge review writer or 5 star giver this journal deserves every bit of praise I gave it, I didn't have any expectations when I bought this (I was just happy to find a good journal after HOURS of looking and not being able to go into a bookstore to look at some in person), so don't expect rainbows to be shooting out of the pages after buying it, but just know that this is a good purchase and if your buying it to give to someone else anyone (unless their a journal hater) would be happy to have this. Use your own judgement and have a good day!",

But, when you open the envelope up, the notebook was also in a sturdy box which was covered in cellophane. I really liked this extra step to ensure the safety of the product, especially when the binding is soft leather.I can really tell that this is a quality product that will last me a very long time until I fill all the pages. Here are the main points I found that make this notebook worth the money:*The binding comes in a really soft leather finish and you can tell that it has been put together really well. It wont be coming apart and the leather does not scratch off like cheap ones can do. (it also has a nice leathery smell to it, which I love)*The size is good for travel so you can write wherever you are and can easily fit into a purse or backpack.*The pages are thick so I know they wont be ripping or bending.*The notebook comes with not only a ribbon book marker but also an elastic to keep it closed.*There is a nice pocket in the back so you can store envelopes or extra cards.* I also really liked the card insert that has a quote by Ray Bradbury and had their customer service email/website in case you have any questions or found an issue with the book.All in all I really like this notebook and will definitely buy it again once I fill these pages. I really like the extra effort that went into making this product and it really shows in all the details.",
