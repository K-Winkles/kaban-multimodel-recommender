                "reviewText": "The covers and binding spirals are extremely sturdy but the spiral is so tight that the paper cannot fully rotate around it. The paper is fantastic and feels like nothing else. It is perfectly heavy and durable and yet incredibly smooth. The sheets are slightly larger than a standard notebook, the lines are college ruled, and there are very convenient blank slants to record the date on the top right corner. Every writing utensil looks better on the stone paper and there is almost no bleed through (even with Sharpies). Gel ink looks especially vivid on them. I personally love Pilot G-2 10 Bold. My only complaint is that the stone paper is not as absorbent so ink takes a longer time to dry so without patience or care one will be left with an illegible ugly smeared mess. You can always use a battery-powered fan or even a small hair dryer if you are especially impatient,lol. If you take care though, nothing creates better looking notebook writing or art. Last but not least, the paper is perforated very finely so it is removed easily and without any tearing. I absolutely love stone notebooks but these are my favorite so far for the date and the perfect perforation. Once you master not smearing your ink, this will become your favorite specialty paper. I think it's worth the price but I'm a paper, marker, and pen snob, lol, so...",

My one main issue with the book as a whole is that the rings holding the pages tear the pages as you're turning them. Or the pages are just really delicate and don't flip easily. Almost all of the 10+ pages I've used so far have torn/ripped around the rings. I personally don't care that much as they're still part of the book. But I know some people might be SUPER irked by that.Overall, pretty nice stone paper book!",

                "reviewText": "I am using these with the Frixion pens, the pens themselves seem to write fine but you have to give them some time to dry. However, the highlighters do NOT work, no matter what they will not dry and will smudge.Not as reusable as I had hoped, was hoping for a RocketBook alternative. The pages are thinner and you can feel the ink marks on the flip side. Also the binding is very annoying, you have to take extra precaution to turn and flatten the page or it will separate from the rings.",

                "reviewText": "I discovered these notebooks by chance several years ago. I was out of town attending a professional conference and needed something to take notes on - so I popped into a convenience store to buy something. I chose this one and spent the rest of the conference relishing how smooth and wonderful the paper feels and how my pen ran over it. It turned a mundane task into something special. And the paper is water resistant (and coffee resistant). I've been using them exclusively ever since. I like taking notes on paper (rather than typing), I feel it keeps me engaged with both the meeting and with ideas that arise. This exact brand and size of notebook has moved from chain to chain apparently in an exclusive deal. The original convenience store chain doesn't offer them anymore; several years ago they shifted to a big box store and then in the early 2020s to another big box chain. Now Amazon may be the only place I can get them? Highly recommend. They come in a larger size but I like this size - it crams into backpacks and purses and coat pockets.",

                "reviewText": "I have a mild obsession with office/school supplies. Needless to say, 7 years of college, and 29384732 notebooks... This one by far is my favorite. The paper is very smooth, thick, and durable. I've been using these past two weeks for my biochemistry notes and to turn in homework pages. The perforations tear nicely. I also tore the edge extra bits leftover from the perforations and started playing with it and tearing it. The paper is very much elastic as it kind of stretches when I tear it. For the most part it is water resistant. I accidentally set down a torn out page on the table where condensation from my iced coffee left it wet, and it didn't really seem to affect it, my ink wasn't smudged or anything and the paper was fine. Probably my only minor complaint is that if you write hard, this may not be the notebook for you. As I mentioned previously, the paper is a bit elastic, so if you leave the pages together and press down hard, you'll get little indents in the paper and it's not as smooth to write on the back of the page.",

I happened to come across this notebook and figured the price was too good to be true, but I was wrong! I love this little notebook probably more than I should. It's a soft cover (flimsy) book, which I like and the paper is great, It's smooth to write on and apparently (I haven't tested this yet) it's waterproof? That part is TBD.For the price, this 2 pack is a home run. I will buy again.",
