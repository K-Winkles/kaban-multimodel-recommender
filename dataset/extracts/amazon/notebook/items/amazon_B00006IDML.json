The quality of this paper is exceptional. I guess I have been skimping too much on buying cheap paper, but never again! As soon as I put my pen down on the paper, I could tell the difference. It is so smooth and easy to write on. In addition, after filling the front side of the first page, I turned it over to find a still-usable surface on the backside. To me, that is like buying double the amount of sheets of paper, since I write pretty hard and don't usually get to use the back of a sheet. Also, my hand cramps up less from writing when using this paper since it's so smooth. If you have this problem like I do, definitely try this paper. I never thought I'd be writing a review on a spiral-bound notebook, but the quality of this product inspired me to. I recommend this notebook for anyone who is sick of cheap paper you can't write on the back side of, and who wants their pen to easily glide across the paper without sticking. I've truly been converted.",

The lines on these pages bleed easily if they get wet, but beyond that this type of notebook with dividers is convenient. You can not choose the color, though. The first time I ordered, I got blue and then green the second time. However, that did not bother me. The pages are well perforated and the lines are a lighter, dull blue. They are clearly visible, but not that dark blue or bright sky-blue that you see in different notebooks. This type is preferable for lecture note taking.",

Sam's Club used to sell notebooks with a very thick back cover which made it very stable to write on when you don't have something to set it down on. I was hopeful that this notebook had the same back but it does not. Also, the paper in this notebook is extraordinarily thin; if it was any thinner I don't think that you could write on it. I paid about $4.50 for it and I'm keeping it to avoid a trip to the store. Given what it is, I don't see why anyone would order this on-line vs. just buying cheap notebooks from wherever.",

They're solid and the front cover is made of a plastic type material. The back cover is thick cardboard (unlike the Mead notebook). This one has three sections, with dividers in between sections. The dividers even have pockets to hold loose papers and handouts. I give this a great review because of the quality, also because they're cheaper here than at my local supermarket.",

And, have gone back and reused/looked at my notes from classes years ago as reference and everything still holds up extremely well. The pockets help organize loose sheets and handouts. There is another 5 star notebook for sale is about $1.50 less expensive and (after ordering both to compare) I think that one is a better deal - as they seem to be the same product. (it's listed as the Five Star Wirebound Notebook, 3-Subject, 150-Count, College Rule, Red (72065))",
