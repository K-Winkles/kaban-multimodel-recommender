Pretty fast shipping, too.I was specifically looking for an unperforated notebook, since I didn't expect to be tearing pages out. I've had other notebooks with perforations that tore unintentionally.These have held up well during their use, with minimal wear near the top and bottom. None on the sheets show significant signs of wear along the spiral binding.The pages are relatively white - white enough to be able to clearly read pencil. I've had other notebooks where pencil blending in with the off-white pages somewhat.",

                "reviewText": "Let me just say that if this notebook had any actual flaws, e.g. the paper gets stuck on the spiral ring (literally the worst problem I can think of when it comes to notebooks) or if some pages were blank, then I would not be so quick to dismiss the snooty notebook connoisseurs who rag on this item.There is not a single complaint any normal, sane person could make about these notebooks. They are the cheapest you can find and just as functional as any other bound grouping of lined papers. Yes, it is a bit floppy. Yes, the pages are thin enough that the next page will have faint and barely-noticeable pressure marks from your pen or pencil. Yes, your first-world sensitivities will be offended by all this. Who cares? It's $1 and the main market consists of starving college students who subsist on ramen that costs less than your typical notebook. Buying this notebook for cheap allows us to invest 300% more in ramen.",

These spirals did the trick.They are made from a average quality paper with a nice sturdy spiral. They come in great colors allowing my girls to have a different one for each subject. Since my girls are still young, these will be perfect and get the job done.I would also recommended them for college. They are perfect for a math class or anything that will be short term use.Overall if you still are in school or have kids, these are amazing. They will get the job done.",

                "reviewText": "This purchase is such a no brainer. Note that Amazon only lets you buy one with each order, but it can help you make the $25 free shipping threshold. At present, these are going for 48 cents versus the 51 cents I paid. You cannot purchase these in the grocery store for that price, which is where I usually get them. I go through these notebooks regularly, using them for shopping lists and planning events. Okay, I'm getting to the point that at times I have to write things down because I can't remember them otherwise. You say, why not post its? Yes, I use those too, but occasionally the project is much more than a post it can handle. For instance, when I go away for one or two weeks, there are a number of things I have to remember to do during the seven days before I leave. So, I dedicate a page for each day and write down the things that have to be done. Similarly, Thanksgiving is coming up. For the two weeks prior, I have a ton of things that need to be done before T Day, and then each day I check off the things as they are completed. Never mind Christmas. You get the idea. I don't care about whether there is a particular quality to the paper or whether the perforation is perfect. The pages are torn out as tasks are completed. And yes, I have even given them to my grandkids for their school projects, with no complaints.",
