I tend to carry a notebook with me for jotting notes from work or home projects. These notebooks are attractive; sturdy (front and back covers are made of strong and water resistant vinal); the loops on the spiral bindings are large and strong (no fear of bindings coming undone) allowing you to open the notebook flat (two pages showing), or flip the pages completely around to minimize size; the pages are firm but not too heavy with plenty of lines to write on; and the notebook easily fits inside a purse or computer bag. Great value as well!",

These notebooks are of a good quality. The cover is light and thick and is slightly wider than the paper to protect the pages. The pages turn easily on the wire binding and the ends of the wire are inside the back cover to minimize snagging or scratching. The first page is a glossy paper sheet. The college lined pages are thick and the perforations are smooth. The Neutral Colors covers are a little more dull and washed out than neutral in my opinion but I consider that to be a personal preference rather than a negative. Overall I found these notebooks to be as described and of a very good quality.",

Who has not snagged a favorite sweater on the old-style spiral binding while carrying an armload of notebooks in a classroom? A very thoughtful design improvement.The pages are of thick paper, and neither ballpoint nor felt-tipped pen ink bleeds through to the back of the page. These open flat, so I find them useful for field notes. The coves are heavy and durable and stand up to a little mist, and in the shoulder seasons are certainly more economical than waterproof notebooks. The different colored covers allow for color-coding. The muted colors - cantaloupe and honeydew melon - are not my favorites, but perhaps offer more camouflage to birders in the field or those on cryptic missions.",
