The durability, pocketed folders, & fun colors make taking notes way more enjoyable for me.After I already make the purchase for these notebooks, I read that a large number of customers were given wrong colors or even received completely different brands... Yeah, I for sure should have checked the reviews before I buying them, but figured it would be hard to not like these notebooks.Anywho, I was VERY happy to receive the correct brand & colors! I will definitely be buying again!",

                "reviewText": "Perforated better than some other brands so you can pull out pages without tearing the paper. Please take note that there's a new style of Five Star notebook that says \"Study guide\" included. These types look virtually the same as the classic ones I am reviewing. However, pages have a triangle next to each line that apparently has some electronic way to then load the page online. That might be cool but at this time my student only wants to write notes on a notebook piece of paper that doesn't have triangles to make it look busy and not then load those notes online. She of course can still take a photo of her notes and send them electronically without triangles.",
