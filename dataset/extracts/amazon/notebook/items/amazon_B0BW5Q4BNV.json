                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars I LOVE THIS NOTEBOOK !",
                "reviewText": "I love this notebook.There is a beautiful black background with flowers, on the front cover and back cover. The cover is thick and sturdy and does not bend or rip. It is also amazing that the cover is waterproof ... I had my notebook next to my drink which accidentally spilled, and the notebook just wiped clean and remained dry and unchanged.I love the doubled spiral binding. There are always times when you need to remove a page ... either you made a mistake, or you need to pull a page loose from the book for some reason ... and if there is no spiral, and you tear out a page, then the whole book can fall apart. So, a spiral binding is important to me.The pages are thick, so that when you write with a marker, it does not bleed through to the other side. So, you can write on both sides of a page without it showing through.The pages are lined, for easy writing. At the top right side of each page, there is small print that says \"Date\" and \"No.\" You can use this if you need it, or ignore it if you dont need it, because it is printed small and light.There are two added bonuses to this book ...(1) At the back, there is an envelope pouch glued to the inside of the back cover. I didn't think that it was important, until I needed it and used it. The pouch expands just a little bit, enough to hold a bulky item, but not enough to keep the notebook from closing properly. I put envelopes with important mail in there. And I put pages that I tore out but then needed to keep. And I put business cards. It is nice to put these loose items in the book and know that they will not fall out.(2) There is a gold elastic ribbon that wraps from the back of the book to the front. You can use this to keep the book firmly closed, so that if the book is in your purse, it cannot open. It also keeps loose papers safe and protected. And, you can use the ribbon as a book mark, so if you wrote on a page and dont want to have to flip through the whole book to find it, you can wrap the ribbon over that page.I appreciate this book because I use it constantly. On one page, I wrote a list of all of my medications ... doctors are always asking what pills I am taking, what doses, how often ... and I just open the book and show it. On another page, I wrote a list of questions for my doctor so that I dont forget to ask, and I listed all of my upcoming appointments. On another page, I wrote out a shopping list of items that I always need, so that when I go to the supermarket, I wont forget anything. On another page, I wrote a list of my bills and due dates and expenses, so that I can keep track of them. And, I love to write poems ... I copied over my favorite poems that I wrote, and I look at them when I am in a waiting room or standing on line, it is better than a magazine. And, of course, I use the book to write down little notes or reminders as they come up.I know that I will fill up this book very quickly. When all of the pages are used, I intend to keep it, and then buy another one.",

Je les utilise depuis 6 mois et l'\u00e9lastique est comme au premier jour. Il y a une pochette \u00e0 la fin. Je ne pourrais pas la commenter, je ne l'utilise pas. La spirale est parfaite pour ins\u00e9rer un stylo et \u00eatre toujours pr\u00eate \u00e0 \u00e9crire. Ils sont assez petit pour les transporter dans mon petit sac \u00e0 dos et m\u00eame dans un sac \u00e0 main. La texture de la couverture est tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able. Elle est tr\u00e8s douce.
