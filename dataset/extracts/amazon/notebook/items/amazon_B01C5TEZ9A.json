                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful notebook for office use!",
                "reviewText": "I really like this notebook! I judge notebooks on both their outsides and insides. Here's the scoop:The inside:The pages are fairly notebook-standard: thin enough to see text behind a page, but sturdy enough to stand up to lots of page turning. The pages have scored lines for removal from the binding edges, but I get cleaner edges folding along the scored line a few times and then removing the page. It's not difficult to remove a page, binding edge and all, from the notebook (in case you prefer that method).The lines on the front and back of each page are light gray; they are a little hard to see in dim light but very pleasing in normal office lighting, daylight, etc. There's a little date box at the top right of the front of each page. I tried out several different types of writing utensils to see how different inks performed on the pages. I provided a photo of my results. In general, anything that is a marker bleeds through--including a highlighter marker. This isn't surprising as most notebooks perform that way, so I don't consider that a negative.The outside:The cover of this notebook is indeed lovely to see and to touch. It's almost velvety! However, the cover is relatively floppy, so you'll probably want a hard surface to use for writing; the notebook isn't suited to using on your lap. That limits the notebook's function for me. Any lotion or oil on your hands will also stain the cover. Finally, unless you are a very conscientious and careful person who has a much more organized bag than I do, the cover will show travel wear. Nothing catastrophic (yet); just things like slightly crunched corners and wear to the edging. The spiral binding, however, is pretty tough. It looks like it did the day it arrived, pristine and brand-new!Overall, my four-star rating is due to all I like about this notebook; I took off one star for the relative floppiness of the cover and its susceptibility to wear. However, when I fill this notebook up, I'll get another one just like it and keep it on my desk for office use. There are other notebooks for travel.",
