Thick plastic covers which appear sturdy and nice coloring.I was quite disappointed that the covers did not have the lettering on the front of any of them as that was the main reason I wanted these specific notebooks. This is why I gave 3 stars; I see reviews with the Pantone lettering on the front so I know that it was true at some point but if this has changed and they no longer offer the lettering on the front, this post is misleading and should be changed.",
