Employing over 200 people, the company prides itself on remaining a family-owned, American small business. Merge the greater clarity of writing on grey paper with sharing technology and you have Whitelines! 3-Pack notebooks. These notebooks have 70 sheets of grey background Graph paper. The paper has Whitelines technology, which, when combined with the free Whitelines mobile phone app, will create an instant electronic file of whatever is on the page, while eliminating all background not on the paper. Whitelines is the new generation of writing paper. The concept is patented and yet very simple: Since markings from pens are dark they interfere with the traditional dark lines of ordinary paper. On Whitelines there is no visual interference between the lines and the pen color. Whitelines makes your writing and drawings stand out. The App removes the background, so all that remains is your writing or drawing over a white background. Whether you take notes for yourself or to share them with somebody else, Whitelines App will help you do both! Whitelines App will capture your note automatically when it detects all four corner codes on the paper and that light conditions are good enough, and then adjust the image to make it useful to you.",

With it not being shipped in a box or any sort of container. The binding on it held up pretty good, but it still was squished and hard to turn the pages and was crushed in the corners a little bit. I could have made do if that was the only issues but unfortunately with it being left out in the rain it did get warped and the pages did get messed up. I am impressed with what it probably went through to get delivered it held up very well! Just make sure to ask for it to be delivered in something other then \"manufacturers container\" even though there wasn't even something, not even a plastic bag. Can't wait for the replacement and to be able to start writing in it!",

                "reviewText": "This is my favorite notebook, period. I am obsessed with notebooks and have tried them all. Whitelines succeeds in offering a high quality grid paper with unobtrusive lines. The closest competitor I can think of is the Roaring Spring Buff Engineering Pad, but to me that serves a different purpose (it is interesting to note that this version of Whitelines is also made by Roaring Spring). The engineering pad is better for working on problem sets. The Leuchtturm1917 notebooks are comparable, but those are way more expensive and the covers are much heavier than they need to be. They feel a bit too precious, like whatever I write in them needs to be of utmost importance.This notebook is great for sketching out ideas, doing research, working on technical and creative things that requires some level of permanence. But at the same time, it's not so nice that I feel bad about doodling stuff that will be trashed later. The paper weight is just right. Ink flows nicely, and isn't visible from the opposite side so both front and back pages are completely usable.I have used Whitelines for years, with their A4 squared notebook. I was quite fond of that notebook, and was disappointed when it seemed they were slowly being discontinued. This notebook was a pleasant surprise, and even better, it improves on the original in several ways. First, it's standard letter size (including the binding... it will be smaller when you tear it off), which is great for those of us in the USA. Second, the backing is a lightweight cardboard, which makes it easier to write on the pad while freestanding; the previous versions were too flexible. And finally it is compatible with the Whitelines Link app, which may or may not be useful for you.My only complaint is that the Link markings take up some space on the corners of the page. There could've been more usable space. And the grid doesn't flow all the way to the edge. There's a margin, but I suppose it just helps to keep the page more tidy. Not a big deal... you could just write over the Link markers since they're so unobtrusive.Love this notebook, I just hope that they don't discontinue it. Might have to stock up.",

I also like how you can take a picture of them on an app and then print them because then you can annotate them better.

                "reviewText": "I love my old Whitelines pad. It's really great for taking notes and doodling. And wonderful for practicing calligraphy. I love the grey background - easy on the eyes. I had found that the background really fades out if I took a photo of what I've drawn. Now, with the app, it's fantastic! Works SO well. I'm quite impressed. I've been making personalized cards for friends and designs to color and it's wonderful to draw the whole thing out, snap a pic, and then get a nice clean line drawing! My only complaint is that I preferred the original pad with the spiral binding at the top - it was much better for drawing. I wish there was more choice! But I love these new pads with the app so much that I won't take a star away. Another issue is that the paper is not that good for fountain pens as they tend to feather quite a bit, but with the app, I can print out my designs on better paper.I am so afraid that these will be discontinued because so few people seem to know about them. Roaring Springs needs to advertise this great product!",

I find that when I use pencil on regular graph paper, the grid lines are far darker and more obvious than my writing. It's distracting while I'm working, and it's distracting when looking at the final product. Whitelines paper, with its gentle white-on-gray look, allows me to keep text and equations aligned while still being able to sketch out nice-looking tables and graphs as needed. It's closer to writing on a blank sheet of paper, but with handy guidelines available if you need them.The funny part is that I almost never use the app for scanning it; I don't buy it for the Link feature/app, although it is certainly convenient when I just want to snap a photo and send it off. And don't get me wrong, I'd prefer it to be cheaper, but I've never found anyone who manufactures paper quite like this. They used to make PDFs available so you could print your own, but sadly those are no longer available. (Still, given how much toner costs, I suspect that this is -still- cheaper than trying to print your own!)Hands-down, it's my favorite engineering pad.",
