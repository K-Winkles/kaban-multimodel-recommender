                "reviewText": "My fianc\u00e9 and I are recently engaged, and I started a journal of entries written to him that I will give him on our wedding day. I love this journal because it is small and sturdy. The book is black, so I do not have to worry as much about wear and tear on it and it has a strap and bookmark to keep it closed. What I found interesting is that there is a little pocket on the back cover that you can store stuff in which is a nice touch.",

Only (small) shortcoming is elastic band used to keep cover closed is a bit wimpy and you must be careful to make it lay correctly. Using it for Zentangle step outs and it works very well with Micron pens. Nice to find something that is just perfect and less expensive than the Moleskins I usually seek out. Thanks Amazon Basics.",
