They are very good quality, but not what I expected.(still like them though) the covers are more like heavier dense thin covered cardboard as opposed to the bendable thicker card stock that regular/average notebooks have.They could easily stand on a bookshelf if needed.I gave 5 stars even though they weren\u2019t what I was after, because the quality and durability of these is pretty dang awesome for the very reasonable price!They will be fun to draw on with markers.\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",

It has lots of high-quality sheets making it a good value for the money. I love the fact that it is made from a sustainable alternative to paper. The quality is very high and will be my notebook of choice from now on. The pocket page is also very sturdy and has been very useful for containing the stray notes needed for my research. Thank you Mintra for this wonderful product.",

                "reviewText": "I love the recycled nature, and the hard cardboard covers (great for when you need to write on your lap), and the two-pocket insert included. I saw that the paper weight was not that high, but I'd never used sugarcane paper before and thought I'd give it a go. Verdict: the pages are a little slick and as thin as the description suggests. One cheap ballpoint I had couldn't really \"grip\" the paper's surface well and skipped more than usual. Any gel pen or marker is going to bleed through (see pics). A good ballpoint (top example) is fine, but a 0.7mm pilot G2 starts to bleed through, and my fave Sharpie S-Gel bleeds through so much that writing on both sides of a page with it would look very messy. Sharpie markers are right out.As I said, the description is accurate, and the price is good for the overall build quality of the notebook, but whether you'll be pleased with the paper will probably depend on your pen.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love these eco-friendly composition notebooks! They are a cut above the regular marble composition notebooks in terms of sturdiness. The covers don't bend easily, making them incredibly durable. Plus, the neutral color allows kids to get creative with decorating or labeling their subjects. Knowing that the paper is recycled adds to the appeal. These notebooks are a win-win for the environment and for kids' school needs.",

While it\u2019s nice to know I see the point of not wanting that all over a book as a teen. Anyways they are nice though and a good quality for the price!",
