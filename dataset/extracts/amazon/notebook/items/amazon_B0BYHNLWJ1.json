I knew I would use them but I my expectation was the quality would be lacking. I was wrong.The paper is of excellent quality, no bleed through from the markers and colored pens that I use. In fact, the paper is more substantial than the last collection of notebooks I purchased from a highly recognized brand.The covers are plastic and appear to be of the same material as other higher cost options.I am impressed with quality of the product. They are an outstanding value!",

                "reviewText": "At first, I used to think there's no way to screw up notebook paper. Unfortunately, I have been proven wrong over the years....with fading and or uneven lines, misaligned holes, etc. So when I see this notebook pack from Studio O, I do not take the quality for granted. The poly cover is flexible yet sturdy and providing a suitable solid surface when writing on the back of pages. The squares are uniformly printed and easy to see, with no fades or voids. Likewise, the binder holes are properly punched and located. The perforations are not that great, so ripping pages out could be a chore; but not a deal breaker since you can still remove easy enough from the spiral binding.",
