                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty simple and classy notebook",
                "reviewText": "Everyone likes something different in their notebooks, so I'm going to focus on telling you what this one is like. It's up to you whether that suits your needs.The cover is very simple \u2014 just a single color with no logo, branding, or decoration on the front of the faux leather material. The back does have an embossed FOROXIN logo in the corner, which is subtle and inoffensive. The cover is sturdy but certainly doesn't have the luxurious feel of leather.There's a built-in elastic band that holds the notebook closed. For the green journal, the elastic band is in a bright green that adds a splash of color & character to the otherwise simple design. It works very well.There's a built-in bookmark too. To me, this is probably the most disappointing aspect of the design. For the green journal, the bookmark is a cheap-feeling fluorescent green fabric, with a somewhat gaudy \"FOROXIN\" branded medallion hanging from the end. I would have been happier to have a higher quality ribbon bookmark that matches the color of the elastic band with no medallion.The paper quality is very good. It's good a weight and thickness, and it's smooth to the touch and provides a crisp writing surface. Each page has a date field in case you're taking notes or journaling. Otherwise, there's nothing fancy about the pages \u2014 just regular college rule lines (actually finely dotted lines).There is a well-constructed pocket attached to the back cover, which would work well for holding receipts or a few loose pages.The product description says it lays flat, but I found that was not necessarily the case. Because the binding is sewn together, certain pages lay flat more easily than others. If you really press a page open, it might lay flat for a while. But, generally, you'll need to hold it open while you write. In my experience, that's to be expected in any sewn binding notebook. If you really want it to lay flat, go with something spiral bound.This is a good sturdy notebook and priced well for someone who journals or takes notes regularly. It's not fancy or luxurious, but then again, it's not meant to be at this price.",
