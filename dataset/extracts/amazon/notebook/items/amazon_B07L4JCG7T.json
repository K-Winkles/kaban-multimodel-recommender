I appreciate that I can purchase it in varying thicknesses, the wide color selection, the excellent paper quality, the college ruled lines, the inner pocket, the ribbon bookmark, and the elastic to keep the notebook secure. I usually use Moleskine but the prices have gotten outrageous so I decided to give this a try and am glad I did.The only features that Moleskine offers that this does not replace is that the pages are not numbered. I also wish they offered this in a dotted grid structure as an option and not only with lined pages. Otherwise, a perfect product and I highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I do art/creative journaling. This means I will use anything in my journal. This is a found gem and will continue to use it for my daily journaling. Best value and size for me.Let's start with the only negative. If you use a wet medium prepare for paper wrinkle. That is the only negative thing I can say.Positive:1. I have never had bleed-through. Occasionally there will be a little ghosting when stamping with Archival. Everything else I have used has not bled. This includes sprays, India inks, stamping inks, assorted pens & markers, watercolors (including brushos), and walnut stain. I don't pre-treat my pages (gesso), so this is just media vs. paper.2. Paper is strong even wet. No matter what I have done to a page it may wrinkle but it has never torn. I use matte medium to attach things. I spray the page before and after using watercolor pigments. I have never had a page not hold true to its original size and integrity.3. Signatures are sewn so pages are in there tight. I have not had migration of wet media via the signature threads.4. I like the size to use as a daily journal. I do a double spread each day and it works for me. I have been journaling for over 20 years and have used everything from comp notebooks to expensive mixed-media books. It is so much better than most, but if you factor in the cost it is really tops. I still keep mixed media books for projects, but for a daily journal, this is it for me for the foreseeable future.5. I like the elastic closure. If you do anything like I do it is nice to keep it closed, but my journal never finishes up flat because of all I put into it.",

It has a nice elastic around, to close the covers when not in use. The pages are smooth with dots. They lie flat when opened which is great for the junk journaling I was using it for. Glue stuck well, stickers stuck well. It arrived fast and in perfect condition. I would buy this again.",

I can tell you now that this notebook is not worth \u00a330.The paper quality is decent at best. Whatever I write I can see on the other side of the page, and this is with pencil too.The saving grace of this notebook is that it is sturdy - hardcover and has good binding. However, most notebooks has good bindings and are sturdy for way cheaper for a similar quality of paper.",
