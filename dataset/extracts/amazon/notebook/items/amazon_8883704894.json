                "reviewText": "Of all the many, many journals I've tried over the years, these Moleskine Cahier Journals are as good as it gets. You can find fancier journals with hard, leather-wrapped covers, gilded pages, and embedded illustrations or decorative scrollwork. You can find cheaper journals (like a spiral notebook). What you won't find is a more pocket- and travel-friendly journal than this.Each journal in this pack of 3 is slim enough to ride in your pocket or any briefcase/pack/purse. The pages are just large enough and lay so flat that you don't feel like you're writing on something as annoyingly small as a post-it note. The ruled lines help keep your thoughts flowing straight across the page, but are printed lightly enough that it works passably well for brief sketches as well. The last 16 pages are perforated so you can easily tear out a sheet to leave a note, reminder, or phone number/address for someone else. The cardboard cover is slim and durable enough to protect the pages from tearing, yet flexible enough to mold to your butt or the bulges in your briefcase/pack/purse.Yes, you can find fancier journals, but you won't find a journal you're more likely to take everywhere and always have on you when good ideas spring to mind. Authors, inventors, artists, theoretical mathematicians, and other obsessive or creative thinkers should never be without one of these. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "As someone sort of losing her memory, these pocket-sized Cahier Journals are the perfectly totable, passport-sized notebooks that serve as a sidecar for my brain. I can tuck one in my fanny pack and pinch it out during my walk to scribble down noticings and keep one in my purse for jotting down ideas, book/movie recommendations from others, and the occasional poem. The ruled lines are narrow, forcing me to write small, but each page has a generous 22 full lines (you can write seven Haiku!). While I\u2019m not a list maker, I imagine this would be a perfect vessel for list-making enthusiasts. The paper is thin and yes, there\u2019s a faint show-through if using a Bic. With a Flair, it\u2019s a more prevalent show through, but I\u2019m not bothered by it as it\u2019s the cost of having such a wonderfully light journal to carry everywhere. The outer bindings of mine have curled at the corners, namely the cover\u2019s bottom right hand corner, but that\u2019s more because of my carelessness with sliding them into purse pockets, aforementioned fanny pack, and jean pockets. The paper is smooth when I rub it against my cheek. Just how I like it. The pocket on the back cover is perfect for receipts and fortunes from fortune cookies. As noted in the product description, the last sixteen pages are detachable, ideal for writing love notes to detach and slide under the windshield wiper of a lover\u2019s car. Highly recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "These pocket notebooks are perfect for carrying always on one's person. It is the same size as a passport, and fits in a back pocket or shirt pocket (on male clothing, at least.)The paper is smooth and accepts ink well, and the cover is sewn on, unlike some other notebooks that are stapled. I'm not sure how much difference this makes in longevity.There is a pocket inside the back cover that doesn't quite along with the back cover, so the glue eventually fails and it just flops about, but it doesn't bother me enough to fix it yet with tape or glue.UPDATEI've gone through several of these now, and they hold up well. However, I think I'm moving on to a different type for two reasons:1. the paper is quite thin. This makes it fit well in the pocket, but if I use a rollerball or fountain pen there's significant ghosting through to the other side.2. there's slight feathering with the aforementioned inky pensMinor quibbles:1. very difficult to tell which side is the front when you pull it out of your pocket. I wrote in white paint-marker \"this side up\" on the cover, which I then varnished to prevent from rubbing onto my clothes.2. I like dot-grid paper better than lined because it affords more flexibility for making tables and diagrams. Moleskine doesn't offer this.My next pocket notebook will be Scout Books DIY Lined Notebook 12 Pack (3.5\" x 5\") with the dot-grid pages. I hear their paper is quite good. Slightly cheaper, too, if you buy them by the dozen.",

Better than the dollar store notebooks I've been using that fall apart in my pockets after a week of use. Nicely bound inside with thread, instead of stapled or ringbound. I like that the second half is perforated so i can rip out shopping lists and phone numbers without destroying the integrity of the notebooks. The flap on the back cover is a pleasant surprise too, useful for storing any torn out notes that need keeping. A handsome set of pocket notebooks that make me feel classier than when i was pulling out dollar store books for my note taking. I'm going to use these till they're full and then try Field Notes after to compare them and then I'll decide which brand to carry in the long run. But I am definitely a happy customer.Very confused about all the negative reviews though. Apparently people think Moleskine is more than a brand name and were expecting to get 3 notebooks bound in the skins of underground dwelling critters and were disappointed to receive normal notebooks? Its a brand name, not a description lmao and it's also moleSKINE (pronounced like mole-skeen) not moleskin anyway!Also the size and measurements are clearly given, it's very obvious that these are thin, pocket sized notebooks. If you're ordering things and not reading the description properly first that's your fault, not the product! Don't give bad reviews based on your inability to read the listing and reviews, ALWAYS research a product before pulling the trigger on it! Common sense folks.",
