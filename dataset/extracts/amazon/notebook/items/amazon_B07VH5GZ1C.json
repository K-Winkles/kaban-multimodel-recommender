                "reviewText": "I was hoping to find small notebooks in this size that have heavy hard board covers as larger spiral journals do. They are really great for lefties as we bear down and push the pen forward. Otherwise I myself must lay a pad down to write, instead of holding it my hand. And 5x7 is a perfect size for notes, not too small or big.I bought them Target in Dollar bins for children. They were little notepads with hard board covers with glossy paper with pictures of Spiderman, etc.These little notebooks don't have a hard journal-type cover, but they look like they will hold up well. The pages aren't flimsy and turn well, and the spirals don't snag. Both cover and paper are far sturdier than a typical notepad like Mead or Top Flight, etc. I will be able to hold it my hand to write, and the cover will likely hold up until use all the pages up.",
