I didn\u2019t see the thickness listed in the measurements in the photos for the notebook so I was surprised it\u2019s so bulky. Otherwise it\u2019s pretty with a nice sturdy cover, quality corner covers, pockets, and note tabs. I\u2019m just not sure if I want something so bulky. I just wish it came in a thinner size with fewer pages.",
