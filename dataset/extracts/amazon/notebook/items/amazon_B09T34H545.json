                "reviewText": "Fantastic Exercise/Writing Book, the cover is beautiful with a nice waxy feel as the protection. The pages are good quality - not too thin, and have pre ruled margins as well as writing lines. It is about the size of a standard exercise writing book, which makes it a good size to transport and use. There is front and first page name and subject/label room. The cover artwork is wonderful - like a collector's piece - a definite keepsake, for precious writing! It arrived quickly in a padded envelope - keeping it in perfect shape.Highly recommend and I will definitely buy again!",
