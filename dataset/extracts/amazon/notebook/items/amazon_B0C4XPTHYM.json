                "reviewText": "These are really great notebooks for everyday writing. I love the gradient design on these, it makes them completely unique from any other notebook I've seen before. The binding is very good and I found that the pages are thick enough to handle many different types of markers and pens without bleeding through. I will make a comment on the size of the notebooks themselves. These are not your traditional notebook size. They are slightly smaller, so keep that in mind when ordering. However, with that said, I feel like this is a good quality notebook set that can be used for a variety of different purposes. Gorgeous colors, fun to use...I personally use them for writing stories.",
