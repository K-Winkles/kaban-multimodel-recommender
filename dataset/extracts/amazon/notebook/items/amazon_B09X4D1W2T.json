Often they can be too wide but these are just right.There are lots of lined sheets at the back for note taking! This is wonderful! In the past you maybe had one.Love the font.Love the darker tabs.Love the deep green color and the softness of the cover.Love the \u201cyearly overview\u201d for this and next year.Lastly I love the much improved \u201cImportant Dates\u201d. It\u2019s easy to use and look for the month.This is definitely the best year they\u2019ve had with this calendar and I\u2019ve bought them for many years.",
