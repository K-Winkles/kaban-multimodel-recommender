Why are there page numbers and 5 index pages? 1.Easy navigation: Page numbers & index pages for quick access to notes & sections. 2.Better organization: Categorize & archive notes by topic or date. 3.Efficient reference: Index pages provide a visual overview, saving time in finding information. Is the paper thick enough? Will it bleed through? We have employed exclusive innovative paper technology on our 100gsm thick paper to provide a perfect canvas for your ideas - no bleeding, no ghosting. We have tested writing with various popular pen brands and confirmed no ink penetration. What binding method is used? Is it lay-flat and lefty-friendly? We use innovative thread binding, allowing the notebook to lay flat at 180\u00b0, accommodating left-handed and right-handed users. This binding method ensures durability and prevents loose or detached pages, surpassing glue binding in reliability. I would like to make a bulk purchase. Is there a discount available? Certainly! You can search for ASIN: B0C3B3QZFQ or visit our store OFFIGIFT to find the link for a 5-pack bundle. It offers a 50% discount compared to purchasing individual notebooks.",

                "reviewText": "I recently got my hands on this notebook, it is a sturdy notebook for anyone who loves jotting down thoughts, doodling, or simply keeping organized in a tactile way. Here's why this notebook is a must-have.Just the Right SizeIt is the right size for tote bags for backpack and large enough to provide ample writing space. This makes it incredibly convenient for on-the-go note-taking, whether you're in a caf\u00e9, on a train, or simply moving from one meeting to another.Smooth Pages for a Satisfying Writing ExperienceThe paper quality is exceptional. The pages are smooth, almost inviting you to write on them. If you're a fan of gel pens like I am, you're in for a treat. The ink glides effortlessly across the page, making the writing experience not just satisfactory but downright enjoyable. No feathering, no bleed-through; just crisp, clean lines every time.One of my favorite features has to be the small pocket at the back. It's a simple addition that offers so much utility. I use it to store sticky notes, bookmarks, and even the occasional business card or receipt. It's like a little treasure trove that keeps all those small but essential items in one place.The notebook also comes with not one, but two sateen ribbon markers. This is especially useful for someone who likes to multitask between different sections of the notebook. I use one marker for my daily to-do lists and the other for jotting down random thoughts and ideas. The sateen texture adds a touch of luxury that I didn't know I needed but now can't do without.Overall, this notebook is a perfect blend of form and function. Its optimal size, high-quality pages, handy back pocket, dual sateen markers, and appealing color options make it a standout choice for anyone in need of a reliable, yet stylish, writing companion. Highly recommended!",

They are so much thicker than I imagined, very sturdy, beautiful and fantastically functional. The pen holder, interior folder, table of contents and included stickies are all big perks. I am starting grad school after years out of school and knew I wanted a notebook I could take with with long after school and refer back to even years later, not the flimsy spiral books I used in undergrad. This was perfect. I never expected to be writing a review for a notebook but here I am, just buy one for yourself and you\u2019ll see.",

                "reviewText": "This journal is great! As a Leuchtturm user I have been kind of going through the alternatives just to see, and this is the closest so far to what I like in a book. I love the blue color. Similar to Leuchtturm, it has two bookmark ribbons, numbered pages, and a table of contents. Then to take it to the next level, it has more pages, a pen loop, and it comes with tab/page markers!My two MINOR cons with this is 1) the paper is still a little too thick/stiff for me, but it\u2019s better than the paper in the Beechmore journal I reviewed earlier this year. I don\u2019t use fountain pens though, so the softer Leuchtturm paper is still my favorite, but the thickness of the book overall and the fact that it still lays flat is great. And 2) even more minor, the vegan leather cover feels a little cheap to me, also stiff. I\u2019m thinking however it will break in with regular use and feel a little more familiar.Also, the elastic band is pretty solid too- some books have a loose band which I can\u2019t stand. Not the case here.All in all I do recommend this for others like me who are used to Leuchtturm but might want something a bit cheaper. This is the one!!",

There is a place to make an index, a place to write who it belongs to as well as offer a reward, and a few pages in the back to test different pens. The sticky tabs included are nice and the back storage pocket seems sturdy, the fabric is glued in between two sheets of paper. I love that it has a place for a pen/pencil. There are two different colored place holding ribbons which are nice and a good length.Con\u2019s: I was disappointed with the color being more of a mustard yellow instead of the yellow color that seemed in picture. Be careful when turning the pages the first few bend up unless you are turning the page from the outer side of the page.",

Each page is numbered, and it comes with 5 content pages (as shown in picture) so you can easily access specific content within your journal.

                "reviewText": "It may not be possible to emphasise enough how this is the best value journal/ notebook out there. You may even struggle to get anything better at any price point.As a fountain pen user, the no bleed pages are a major plus as one of the reviews stated they bleed which raised concerns. I use the Mont Blanc 146 (medium nib), Bond and Regent (medium nib), Scriveiner (broad nib) and Wordsworth & Black (medium nib). I can confirm non of them bled.The other plus that\u2019s hard to beat is the build quality and that feel that makes you sit straighter than usual and write more carefully. I know it may seem like just a journal and maybe difficult to explain.Oh, and there is the dual bookmarks, the band to hold it shut, the content pages at the front, the numbered pages, the stickers and pouch at the back.For reference, used Leuchtturm and Oxford journals last 3 years, which were the best for my needs at that time but this one is better by far.Thanks for reading my review!.Disclaimer: I have not been paid for this review! As a writer, things like this excite and this notebook surely did. How could I not have seen this earlier?",
