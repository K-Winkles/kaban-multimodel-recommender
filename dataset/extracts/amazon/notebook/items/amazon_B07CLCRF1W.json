                "reviewText": "To Serge's Case of Comrade Tulayev and Memoirs of a Revolutionary, add the recently discovered Notebooks: 1936-1947. Serge was an eloquent witness to his times. The Notebooks, which mainly consist of short essays on topics ranging from the Russian Revolution and its aftermath to Mexico in the 1940s, provide fascinating glimpses into Serge's political thought, his response to current events, as well as his personal life. The text runs 595 pages and is followed by fifty-pages of the editors' useful short biographies of the many people Serge knew or was concerned with. 595 pages might seem long but once I'd finished the book, I regretted it wasn't even longer.",

                "reviewText": "Serge was a unique observer of history and politics in the 1st half of the 20th century -- an unwavering leftist who publicly and almost fatally objected to the totalitarian turn of post-revolutionary Russia and who disagreed with nearly everyone but stayed on friendly terms with all but the most die-hard Stalinist sympathizers. The Notebooks are a somewhat messy combination of observations largely on 5 themes: Trotsky, Trotsky's widow, and Soviet subversion of disloyal leftists (including Serge's fears of his own assassination); socialism and its real-world implementation (or not); current events and possible trends in world politics during World War II (Stalin as weakened by the Nazi invasion, Stalin and Hitler, Stalin and post-war Europe); the travel diaries of a socially engaged tourist in Mexico; and philosophical musings on art and life. One can skip over sections of lesser interest, of course, but the whole is really remarkable and unique.",
