                "reviewText": "I'm a college student in my 40s and I still like to write notes by hand. This is great for keeping all my notes separate for each class and I love that there is a folder in the dividers. I use the folders for the lab handouts I get for my classes. It is a pretty thick notebook, so keep that in mind. I wasn't expecting it to be this thick and it takes up a bit of room in my rolling backpack, but I will be reusing it each quarter so it's a good investment. The removable dividers will make it easy to use again next quarter so I can keep some relevant notes and just move the divider down to the next blank pages. Overall, a great product.",

The price difference between teal and red was ridiculous (~\u00a37) but, honestly, the notebook is the same.In general, the notebook is great if you take various subjects a day and have a folder at home where you actually sort the pages into coherence. If you want a single notebook for year-round activities it does have some flaws: you cant add new pages, the sectioning is limited and its uncomfortably bulky to use outside the table/seat scheme (e.g. field trips, those baby chair seats universities love, labs or practicals). I don't recommend carrying this along a laptop or other bulky things since its HEAVY, my back has not forgiven me.Overall a 4/5 for what I intended it for, for more versatility it could however be substituted by a folder and refill pages so 3/5.",
