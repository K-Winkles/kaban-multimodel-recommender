The paper inside doesn't feel too thin, which is nice as the writing texture doesn't transfer onto the next page as I have experienced previously with some thinner papers. While this isn't relevant to me as I write in pen, I will note that if you were to write in permanent marker, I don't believe it would be thick enough to deflect ink bleeding through to the next page. Overall the product arrived exactly as described and I am satisfied with my purchase:)",

It is exactly what I was looking for (perfect except for the color choices...black is a little boring, but it'll do...and pink...uh, no). The size and weight are perfect, seems to be very good quality, the pages (100) and plastic sleeves (3) are nice...and as an added bonus -the cover folds back on itself!! I will definitely buy more ESPECIALLY if they add more colors. My vote would be no primary colors but something rich and deep -earthy colors. Thanks for a great product.",
