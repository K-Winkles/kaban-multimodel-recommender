As I am currently in school to be a seamstress, there is 4 modules I have to complete, as I was looking for notebooks that had the following criteria: be a pack of 4, not too expensive, the sheets being thick enough, because I make patterns, write important info and use not only pens, but markers to make the notes, and I needed a good quality sheet that would prevent that from happeningLong story short1st I tested the sheet quality and thankfully, it is really good, as it can be seen in the video, only the sharpie was the one that bleed trough the paper, but I have other marker options to use instead of that2nd this notebooks being in a pack of 5, not only allows me to have a notebook for each module, but have 1 extra for something else3rd it was the most inexpensive option I could find, and when I bought it it had 30% off, so that was a good dealThe only thing is that I wanted the notebook to be a square grid option because that way would be easier for me to draw the patterns and stuff, but the dotted one is also very convenient, and I would like them to have more sheets, because I am very clumsy and if I mess up in the slighets, I'll just ripp out the whole page, leaving me with less space for me to make this notes, so there it is, I would recommend this notebooks, sorry for the long review but wanted to make it as detailed as possible, because I couldn't find any reviews that actually showed if the sheets would bleed",

                "reviewText": "These Dotted Spiral Notebooks look exactly like the pictures in the listing. The covers are sturdy and water resistant, which I love! I purchased them to start bullet journaling, and I chose these specifically because they are spiral bound, which makes it easy to remove a page when I make a mistake that is beyond what an eraser or white-out can fix. I also like the page size (standard 8.5\" by 11\" paper size,) because there's plenty of space to create calendars, lists, entries, etc. with room to doodle or use washi tape or stencils to decorate the pages. Having 3 journals made it easier for me to get started. I tend to be a \"perfectionist\" when I'm writing things down, so I use the first notebook for planning out my journal pages & for lettering practice. The second notebook is my actual daily journal, and I'm still deciding what I'll do with the third one. (I have a few ideas!) Once these notebooks are full, I'll be buying more! Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "Really great quality paper. I haven\u2019t noticed any significant bleed through, and I use pretty high quality, black gel ink. The punched edge doesn\u2019t curl up within the spiral with use which allows for ease in flipping through your pages over time and maintains that \u201cnew\u201d clean look. The elastic closing band is like a hair elastic and I found it kept the book from lying flat when writing in it, however it\u2019s easily removed.I use these notebooks on a daily basis. I bought them thinking I\u2019d only ever use one, but I have found myself using all three for various reasons and intend to buy again.",
