These are by far the best quality spiral notebooks either one of us has ever used. It's a relatively small expense to feel like you're working in an executive corner office instead of a cubicle - LOL.The size is a bit smaller than the typical letter size pages we get here in the us in the usual office store spiral notebooks, but still big enough to essentially do the same job. And the paper inside is far superior. The binders, too, are sturdy and good looking. And the spiral itself is hefty and turns the pages evenly instead of on an angle.All in all, a very nice product of the highest quality for what it is.",

It had super fast shipping and got here within 3 days. The paper feels super sturdy and I love the spiral binding, it makes journaling so much easier when you don\u2019t have much space to have a notebook opened all the way. I love the metal around the corners because it will help keep it from getting too banged up when I travel. I really was not expecting it to be this high quality. Just get the notebook, you won\u2019t regret it.",
