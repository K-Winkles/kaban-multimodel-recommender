It just is a smooth, clean paper of a nice weight with great hand. He\u2019s not keen on how thin some papers are (looking at you, Tomoe River), and I dislike thick sheets for myself. We are both pleased with notebooks in this line!- they offer several different styles, so you can get blank, dot grid, graph or lined! There are even notebooks with blank on one side and dot etc on the other- different sizes- spiral bound is available at top or side- because of the firm plastic cover and back, your notebook is well protected.Japanese paper tends to be high quality and both the paper and construction of the notebooks themselves do not disappoint.We tried to find this configuration out and about at a local store, but lined seems to be a less popular option these days, so we found it here. It was well priced and always nice not to have to pay shipping on a small order that wouldn\u2019t otherwise meet minimum at a niche shop.",

It makes taking notes a pleasant experience, especially with good quality pens. Even pencils feel so much better on these, they don\u2019t scrape, but sort of glide and just feel so nice to write with.I used a regular notebook after a while of using the maruman ones, and I was surprised at how much worse they are, I don\u2019t think I could ever go back.Would highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a huge fan of this, bought it as a one off because I didn't have time to go to the Blick to get a new sketchbook before classes started. Will absolutely be buying again...and again...and again.Dot grid layout is in 1mm sections, that's my only \"downside\" given that I'm in America and we're afraid of base-10 numerical systems for some reason.Otherwise, writing in it (using a 0.5mm mechanical pencil and a 0.5mm Archival Ink Micron) has been a dream. My lines are clean and drawing on it feels incredibly smooth, especially with a pen. Eraser marks are a bit more obvious on this paper than \"standard\" sketchbook paper, but sketching light and using a polymer eraser seem to be decent.There is no bleed through from front to back page whatsoever. Because of this, the pages definitely have a decent weight to them, but still tear out easily. Since the paper is much smoother than standard sketchbook paper, it does have a small amount of smudge when drawing with an ink pen - but it's barely noticeable given how quick the dry time is.Overall, if you can snag this while it's on sale - you may as well buy a few. Great value overall, I do wish it had a higher page count option, but it's great for semester work.",

The paper can handle actual fountain pens, and I like to use it for pen and ink sketches. The surface is silky smooth and the show through is very very minimal, with no bleed at all that I've encountered yet.But, the last one I ordered from here was an A4 size and shipped in a super flimsy envelope. It arrived with an unfixable crease that went through all of the pages, and the binding had been bent badly enough that I couldn't fix it. Not to the point of making it sturdy and comfortable to use, at any rate.The quality of these notebooks is stellar, and the prices I've seen here are really good. But sometimes it may be in your interest to order from a seller who will pack them with more care.",

Most mass produced notebooks that you get from office stores are terrible because the pages are thin, they tear easily, and the spine unravels ruining everything. It\u2019s like they don\u2019t care about you or quality.This notebook however, has sturdy yet aesthetically pleasing pages, sturdy spine, sturdy cover, looks better than 90% of all of the other notebooks. Also the pages can be torn cleanly into perfectly sized pages that will fit perfectly into a printer, or with other documents when you need to staple. It\u2019s the Bugatti of notebooks, even my college professor admired it. It\u2019s the only notebook I buy now, no other notebooks come close.Do you want to be the person with a weak, boring notebook or do you want to be the person with a sturdy, sexy, high quality notebook that you know is will outlive the others five times over while gaining you compliments?",

                "reviewText": "I'm not heavily invested into the quality of paper for this notepad--I just use it for writing down my daily goals, and occasional journaling. That being said, it's one of the loveliest pieces of paper I've ever written on. The paper is durable, writing is easy, and the faint, grey, lined ruling works so well with the stuff I do. My major complaint, however, would be the binding. For the first ~5 months out of the ~7 it's been in use, the twin wires at the top haven't been hasslesome to deal with. But currently, anyone can notice that all the wires tilt slightly to the left. The wires at the top-left corner have also exited the little square slots in which they go, and I had to manually put them back. The functionality of the steno pad didn't change, but I might in the future. If you intend to take this notepad through rough conditions, I recommend you seek a different product. Also the lower back ends of the pad has become a bit dog-eared, but that's probably because I kept this Steno Pad in a backpack.",

                "reviewText": "Amazon may have worked with Maruman directly to have this 1/4\" special/limited production, and it is a brilliant new product. This more natural spacing allows for better use of the paper bc you dont have to always leave an empty line between writing. it's optional and up to you. The original 5mm square/grid sizing meant leaving empty rows when you wished you didnt have to. So... very happy someone finally did this new version so well.Now, if Amazon continues to raise the price to what they originally listed, i think buyers remorse will become much higher. i was glad to buy a bunch of these with reduced pricing that Amazon finally offered. I hope the increase in sales will convince them to not jack up the price -- because using an overpriced commodity never feels good.",

I also like the subtle perforations on every page, which makes it easier to tear them. It's made in Japan as well, so what's not to like. Highly recommend Maruman.",
