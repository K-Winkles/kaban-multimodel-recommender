                "reviewText": "I use this notebook for its portability and convenience. The pages are nicely lined, with areas for a page title and date.The cover is sturdy and durable, it has held up to sweat and bending, without showing any real signs of wear. The elastic band for holding the notebook closed also does a great job.My only complaint is that the elastic for holding a pen is too large for thinner pens. If there was a good way to adjust this, then the notebook would be perfect. As it stands, I have to be careful that my pen doesn't slip out when I'm using/storing the notebook.",
