                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Compact and Cute, but Thin Paper",
                "reviewText": "I purchased the EOOUT 4 Pack Mini Spiral Notebooks, and while they have their charm, I found the paper quality to be disappointing. Here's my detailed review of the EOOUT Mini Spiral Notebooks:Compact and Cute Design:The compact size of these notebooks is a definite plus. They fit perfectly in my pocket or bag, making them convenient for on-the-go note-taking. The cute designs on the covers add a touch of personality and make them visually appealing. The spiral binding allows for easy flipping of pages and keeps the notebooks securely intact.Good Value for the Price:Considering the affordability of the EOOUT Mini Spiral Notebooks, they offer decent value for the price. The pack of four notebooks provides ample supply for various note-taking needs. Each notebook contains a sufficient number of pages to capture important information, making them suitable for quick reminders, to-do lists, or jotting down ideas.Thin Paper Quality:The biggest drawback of these notebooks is the thinness of the paper. While it is understandable that mini notebooks may have thinner pages due to their size, the paper in the EOOUT notebooks feels exceptionally delicate. Writing with certain pens or markers can cause ink to bleed through the pages or leave visible impressions on the backside. This limits the usability of the notebooks and may require more careful pen selection.Limited Durability:The thinness of the paper also affects the overall durability of these notebooks. With regular use, the pages can tear or crease easily, and the spiral binding may become loose over time. Although the notebooks are not designed for heavy-duty use, it would be beneficial if the paper had more durability to withstand everyday handling.Sufficient Page Layout:The page layout of the EOOUT Mini Spiral Notebooks is simple and functional. Each page contains ruled lines, providing guidance for neat and organized writing. The spacing between the lines is appropriate, allowing enough room for both small and medium-sized handwriting. The simplicity of the layout makes these notebooks versatile for various writing purposes.Suitable for Light Use:Considering the thin paper and limited durability, the EOOUT Mini Spiral Notebooks are best suited for light use or occasional note-taking. They are handy for quick jottings, short-term reminders, or temporary lists. However, for those seeking notebooks for extensive writing or long-term use, it might be worth exploring options with thicker paper or more durable construction. EOOUT 4 Pack Mini Spiral Notebooks offer a compact and cute solution for portable note-taking. Their affordability and decent page layout make them suitable for light use. However, the thinness of the paper and limited durability are significant drawbacks, as they affect the overall writing experience and long-term usability. If you prioritize thicker paper and greater durability in your notebooks, it might be worth exploring other options.",

                "reviewText": "These things are cheap, but only in price, not in quality. It fits comfortably in your hand, has bendy but durable covers, and looks nice. I tested it with pencils and pens and such and they all worked fine and none bled through. Then I used a thick sharpie, and surprisingly, the only place it bled was to the other side of that page. Usually with cheap paper it would bleed onto at least the next page if not the one after that. I also tried pouring water on the cover to see how well it could handle a spill. I was shocked, it barely felt wet at all and the first page behind the cover was completely dry. Overall, very worth the buy. Recommend 10/10.",

The cover is cardboard but so far has held up really well despite carrying it around in my bag for a few weeks. The spiral binding is big enough to hold a standard pen, which is handy so I'm ready to take notes at any time. I've been very happy with these little notebooks!",
