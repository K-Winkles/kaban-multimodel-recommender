I can fit so many things on one page & it's not bulky or heavy, so having it in my bag doesn't hinder my ability carry it or pack more of my stuff in the bag alongsideThe pages are thick enough to handle felt tip fine liners and the spacing is just right.The numbered pages & index make ot perfect for my notes/as a reference book.Thr cover is a softer, but sturdy, leather-likr material that not only protects the pages, but enables you to easily fold if you need more space on your desk. The little strap hold it in place as well, which I've never been able to do with past notebooks.The pocket in the back is made of thick paper so it can hold quite a bit.It's an attractive notebook that helps me stay organized! Not to mention, I feel more confident with it at work because anytime I have one of those moments where you just can't seem to remember how to do something, it's right there for me to look through.",

I use it for note taking.I use a very inky pen and some pastel colored highlighter in it. The bleed through is barely noticeable. The paper feel smooth and cool, which I love. At the top corner of each page there is a place to write the date. Each page has a page number at the bottom. At the beginning of the notebook there is a table of contents. At the end of the notebook, there is a pocket/envelope where you can store paper. The notebook also came with a few colorful post-it page tabs.My favorite thing about this notebook is that the lines aren\u2019t bold black, they are a very thin light black color.I\u2019m considering buying the smaller version to journal in and to carry around by hand.",

I haven't tested yet with any nib above an M. I will try to update after using my BB and stub nibs.",
