                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is my first time grabbing a laptop cooling pad online. I did some shopping around to see which ones matched the dimension of my MacBook Pro. This one was a little bit smaller than what I was anticipating, but I decided to grab it anyway! I\u2019m happy that I did.The ergonomic design of this cooling pad is great! It positions comfortably in your lap, on desk top or table top!The adjustable stand gives you a wide variety of options for positioning and angling!The 2 USB ports made into the unit are a great addition!The adjustable extension arm for the cell phone was a great added bonus! Gives you a great place to keep your phone close by its really effective for multi-screen use with your computer!There are 5 blades for heat dissipation. These fans are great for keeping my Mac from overheating and shutting down! Even with the adjustable fan speed, this thing is super quiet!I love the fact that it illuminates! The blue light gives a bit of a techie futuristic look! You can not choose whether or not the light is on or off. Once you turn, the fans on the light comes on as well. Im sure for some people I\u2019m sure that is an issue, for me I didn\u2019t post too much of a problem.Great for smaller laptops, may not be as convenient for larger ones. I have a MacBook Pro 16 inch and it barely fits. The listing online mentions that up to 14 inches is good, so I know I was pushing it. But it seems to still work reasonably well!",

                "reviewText": "I got this to keep my laptop cool in my second location. My primary one I use a cylinder-style blower so will be a point of comparison.This cooling pad, when first plugged in, produced a bit of a scraping noise which was seemingly the center fan. After a while of running that noise went away. The overall design is good and will fit for those looking for laptop lift with phone attachment/stand. For my use, I have my laptop lying flat without the need for phone, but it's nice to have the extras just in case.In terms of cooling this does no where near as a good job as my other blower, but then again it also moves significantly less air and max speed is quieter than my min speed on the blower. Flow rate wise it is on the lower side in that it's able to keep my laptop cool while mostly idle but once semi-active the laptop fans kick on. For me, this works as my use case is for a gaming laptop with a 200w power supply (gtx1660 type laptop). I was not expecting massive cooling capabilities and really just wanted the idle state to remain cool and it does that well.For my other laptop which is significantly lower power requirements I used it all day and did not notice the internal fan turning on and the general case/keyboard was much cooler than open-air style. This, I would say, is the correct application of this cooler.For the price of $24.99 at received it's a bit steep but the current 40% off makes it a good buy for light applications. If looking to keep your laptop cool and is a power-hungry one look elsewhere for the same original price.Note: Description/images show the air moving downward or vacuum method but in reality it pushes air upward.Note2: You can *not* turn off the blue lights, I would not recommend this for bedrooms",

                "reviewText": "If you have a laptop that is sitting on a flat surface, unless you plan on killing it in about half the time that it normally takes to ruin a good laptop, you better get some air underneath. Every computer generates a ton of heat. If there is no circulation in spots, the heat builds to a point where it could melt plastic and ruin a good hard drive. Your laptop needs to be cool, just like anything else. It may never sweat, but it will overheat. This set up takes away alot of that guessing game and keeps your cpu, motherboard, and delicate components cool and running in top shape. It looks amazing doing it as well with its blue tinted LED back lighting.",

                "reviewText": "Note the size of this laptop cooling pad - it is considerably smaller than the norm. If you have a larger laptop, this is not what you want, but if your laptop is smaller, this is a good choice that will fit well.Even though it's small, it still has 5 powerful fans that run very quietly - I could hardly hear the noise over the noise of the regular fan built into my laptop.The manual is not very helpful - and wrong: it claims there are 3 USB ports but really there are only 2. Otherwise, this works great, very much like most other similar cooling pads.There's an adjustable stand on the bottom if you want your laptop held at an angle (which I don't, but your tastes may differ). There's also a little flip-out stand you can use for your smartphone, but again, I didn't find this very useful as its location was kind of in the way and out of my sightlines. Doesn't do any harm though and you may like it.This seems a little more expensive than many other similar cooling pads, so shop around - but in my experience it is also much quieter, which is worth a few extra bucks.",
