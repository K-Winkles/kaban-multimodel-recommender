        "description": "Oxford 3-Subject Poly Spiral Notebook 2-Packs are a smart way to stock up on school supplies. Notebook covers are made of wear, tear & moisture-resistant plastic that\u2019s durable enough to protect your notes and outlast other spiral notebooks. Each 3 subject notebook provides 150 sheets of pure ruled inspiration. Wide-ruled pages provide lines with more space than college ruled notebooks. Sturdy notebook paper handles ink pens, colored pencils, mechanical pencils and highlighters for beautiful, A+ worthy notes. Our notebooks have a 3-hole punch to fit any standard binder. A snag-resistant coil keeps wide ruled pages secure and resists catching on backpacks and clothes like lesser quality notebooks. Micro-perforated notebook sheets detach easily so do-overs don\u2019t slow you down. Three double-sided divider pockets keep notebook sections separated and loose sheets organized and close at hand. Our spiral notebook isn\u2019t just for school supplies and home school students. Add to your office supplies or home office shopping list for project planning, bullet journals and to-do lists. 3 Subject. 8-1/2\" x 10-1/2\". Wide ruled, 150 sheets. 2 Pack in blue and black.",
