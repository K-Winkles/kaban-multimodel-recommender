The off white color is a nice change from the stark white paper that is in most notebooks. Sure, the dollar stores have notebooks, but you definitely get what you pay for. The cheapies do work, but the covers are thin, and the paper is lower grade.The books seem to be made well. The cover colors are nice too. If you are serious about writing, this notebook is for you. I am a lefty, so I prefer ballpoint pens over gels. The Zebra Z-Grip pens that I use work wonderfully with these EMSHOI books.I like to journal, and a nice book to write in is a real treat. I highly recommended these, and I would purchase them again.",

                "reviewText": "I will defiantly being buying these again when I run out of notebook pages. They are simple but very aesthetic. I've found I prefer having 4 small notebooks with different colors like this instead of one large 3-5 subject notebook. These are not as bulky and don't take up a lot of room in a bookbag. They also come with sticky page markers you can write on which is a nice touch. So still even if you want a notebook that has several subject in one you can add a page marker to make it into one. The pages are high quality paper and include a date section at the top of the page. Overall, best notebook I have bought yet I would recommend buying these. Also the price is very reasonable for the quality you get.The only thing I would change would be to make the covers a little more durable. They still hold up well and aren't flimsy but if I had to pick one thing to improve that would be it. They are a bendable plastic cover and I would change this to either a non bendable plastic or to a sturdy cardboard. But this is just me being picky the current cover is perfectly fine.",

                "reviewText": "These are good notebooks. The covers are a durable plastic, and the pages are thick, heavy paper. The graph lines are dotted, thin, and a grey color. It allows you to keep notes organized but have you writing stand out instead of the heavy blue/black lines of typical graph paper. They work great for taking notes and are extremely helpful when drawing diagrams or keeping math organized. They are a bit pricey, but I've found them to be worth it for the most part. Sometimes the spirals get hung up and you'll have to fix it but only after heavy use. I've been using these notebooks all through college now and they're still in good condition by the end of the semester. I can go back though my notes from previous courses which is something I'm not always able to do with the cheap notebooks.",

                "reviewText": "I actually REALLY like these notebooks. First of all the pages are a nice off-white/cream color, kinda like ones are journals which i think looks more neat.They\u2019re a little smaller than regular notebooks but not too small, and they have 180 pages a notebook which i think is good to split between 2 classes if you\u2019d like! The package also comes with little tabs to put on the pages if you\u2019d like to mark something which i thought was a nice touch! Overall i think size and amount was exactly what i was looking for!",

                "reviewText": "At \u00a39.99 for 640 A5 pages (320 sheets) , these 4 notebooks are excellent value for money. The paper is very fountain pen friendly with no bleed-through and a smooth, but not glossy surface. Paper colour is a pleasing very pale cream rather than brilliant white. I ordered 4 notebooks with lined pages and - in spite of the 'random' warning - that is what I received in 4 different colours. The 36 'sticky note' coloured tabs are a useful bonus. Unless you want perforated pages there is no better notebook IMO (& I have tried Rhodia, Oxford Optik & Cambridge)",
