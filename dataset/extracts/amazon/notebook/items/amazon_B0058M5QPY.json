                "reviewText": "This is my absolute favorite notebook. I've use it for a more than full-time university course load over the last 2 years, 3 to 6 classes per school quarter. I take detailed notes for every class and this notebook is the only one I will use any more. I about cried when I went to order another set and they were not available lolThe awesome things about the iScholar 9.5 x 6.5\" 5 subject notebook:- The size is *perfect*. It's substantial enough that I've never run out of pages for any particular subject and it's small enough to both fit easily into a purse and I can comfortably write in it on the tiny desks we have in classes.- The ringed design is very functional- even for a left-hander. I like being able to fold back the notebook to a single layer so that as I write on either side of the pages with my left hand, the rings don't get in my way.- The covers are substantial and sturdy. I've spilled coffee on my notebook and saw my life flash before my eyes but the cover deflected all the liquid, I was able to wipe it down so it wasn't even sticky. These notebooks bang around in my backpack and purse all quarter long and the pages inside stay pristine.- The pages are perforated and they tear quietly, so you can take a page out in the middle of a lecture without disturbing everyone.- The dividers are moveable. During the quarters when I've had just 3-4 classes, I'd take a divider out and move them around to give more pages to each class. Love being able to customize it. I've also taken dividers out of notebooks from previous quarters and added them to a new notebook to make a 6 subject set.- The dividers are thick and sturdy like the covers- it makes it easy to quickly flip to any subject. I like to label the tabs but since they're color-coded, it's not even necessary to label.- The notebooks sit well on a shelf. I keep an archive of my notes from previous classes to refer back to, and these notebooks stand up on their own on a shelf without needing bookends or any type of support/box, etc. Love being able to go to my shelf, pull the notebook I need and go right to the divider I'm interested in.The only things I would make better:- Strengthen the rings, they will bend if smashed. With my level of normal use, even banging around in my backpack with heavy books, it was fine. But because I'm short, I tend to use my backpack to prop my feet up on and I've bent the rings on the notebook that way. You definitely have to be abusive for the bending to happen, and they bend back quite easily if you catch it before any pages start falling out.- Be able to choose the color of cover you get. A small luxury but would be nice to not stare at my least favorite color all quarter because I didn't get a choice.",

                "reviewText": "My books may not be best sellers yet, but they are published and I'm on my way to making my dreams come true with the help of iQ. All dreams start somewhere. The right tool is what every writer needs to get there as quickly as possible. Years of scratching on everything from napkins to sticky notes was nothing compared to the 5-subject, 9.5 x 6.5, college ruled, spiral bound iQ notebook with moveable tabs. It allows me to separate my on-the-fly ideas from my character generations sheets. I can keep scenes and chapters in their perspective sections. If I run out of room, I simply move the tab over for more paper or take the tab out entirely and it becomes a 4 subject book. The point is the wonderful notebook allows for creative flexibility. The iQ notebook is the first best seller I can count on to get me where I want to be someday; a published best seller of my own. If you're an author, or just dream of becoming one, get the iQ notebook by iScholar.LM FieldsAuthor & Artist",
