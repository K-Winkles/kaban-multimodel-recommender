We purchased this Friday afternoon and received it Sunday afternoon. It was packed in a bubble wrap envelope and shipped with care - no bends or rips - Yay!! For the price, I wish the cardboard back cover was sturdier. I do appreciate that I didn't have to spend time in the stores and weekend traffic looking for this and that my child could pick the notebook cover color. I like the quality of Mead/Five Star products. It does have the label for Neat Sheet perforated pages on the front of our notebook.",

This book is average in thickness and enough to last me two quarters(I bought two.) Granted the grid lines are very faded and hard to see but it shouldn\u2019t be much of a problem. Would definitely buy it again",

                "reviewText": "I'm giving this spiral notebook 5 stars mostly because it was affordable and I'm quite pleased with the quality of the graph ruled printing. The paper itself is of an acceptable standard too. Not too thin, acceptable levels of ink bleed-through to where it doesn't become distracting writing on both sides. What I never like about spiral notebooks is the inclusion of the spiral. At times it can hurt to write over. Perhaps one day someone will invent an acceptable compromise between the stiffness of glue binding and the discomfort of the spiral binding.",
