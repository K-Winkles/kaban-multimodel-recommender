I\u2019m used to the standard black composition books, and these aren\u2019t them.However, the size turns out to be a bonus, because they can be used for many things, but ESPECIALLY as a Project Notebook. Nice because most of my projects are short term and there are enough pages for each project.For instance, soon I\u2019ll be starting a cosmetic remodel of my new house. I don\u2019t need a giant project book, this one is just right. Same for using it as a vacation planner. And you can put identifying stickers or draw on the front, because the front is plain tan color. Lastly, they easily fit in my bag, and take up much less room than the regular size.These coming instead of the standard comp book was a happy accident. You might want to give them a try.",

They are standard (excellent) Oxford notebook quality - made really well, paper is thick enough that ink doesn't show through to the other side, binding is good enough for it to last. It's hard to find fault on this one. I love the plain cover so I write/decorate it. Depending on your pants, these can fit into your back pocket (more so for men since the pockets are bigger) - pair it up with those mini pens and you have a great portable notepad.

This little notebook is perfect for that, it\u2019s not really designed to tear them out. At 8 x 5 1/2 and only a quarter inch thick it\u2019s a great size to throw in my handbag or laptop case!",
