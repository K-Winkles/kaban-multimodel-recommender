                "reviewText": "I'd like to write one of those reviews about Hephaestus forging this notebook from the blood of the Gods or something, but that's not really true.This is really a very straightforward product. It's a nice color to stare at, the lines are generally not too dark to see what I'm doing, the pages are numbered, and the just-bigger-than-letter size works well with gluing in the occasional printout.I discovered fancier paper and journaling somewhat recently and have taken a few cues from that in how I set mine up. In particular, I put an index on pages 2-5. That, page numbers, and doing most of my note-taking in a bound book, as opposed to on pads with separable sheets, means I can find my notes way more easily.A downside to bound notebooks is I can't hole punch a page and put it in there. I've had to change my work habits a little: an entire spec doesn't go in there the way I'd sometimes added them to the binders I was using. But if I have a page or two that I refer to a lot, I'll glue that in. I'm paid to be an engineer, not to hand-copy lots of minutiae. As a side benefit, the bulk stays a little more under control. My One True Binder was getting pretty bulky.I've been starting my meeting notes at the beginning and my projects about halfway through, with a tab. That keeps my projects (relatively) contiguous.The paper is durable enough that tabbing pages works fine and that I can bang it around my desk and sometimes my work bag without really thinking about it for the three months or so it takes me to use all the pages. As a side benefit, I've come to realize that information about a project from three months ago is maybe not all that useful anymore or has changed. When I fill a notebook, I recopy whatever still matters. Honestly, it's not all that much and builds in a nice nudge to check on any projects that are simmering in the background. Also, it makes recopying things an active choice, so I have less clutter, whereas with my One True Binder, purging things was the choice, and I tended to have a lot of crap I didn't really need anymore.",

I will say this: my handwriting is, most of the time, light pressure so maybe keep that in mind.The off-white color is also my preference\u2014hate bright white.

Back then, the company paid for 'em but now I have to. After the frustration of using cheaper substitutes, I simply won't use anything else. Bottom Line: This is a professional-quality tool with no compromises. Anything less is just for doodling.PROs-Rigid and durable: stays flat when writing on any surface, covers and pages won't rumple like cheaper notebooks-Spiral binding is very strong, will not crush or distort, opens completely to lay flat-Graph paper rule-Numbered pages allow for easy indexing-A pleasure to write on: highest-quality paper accepts ink consistently without bleed-through (great with \"Pilot G-2 07\" pen)-Buff-colored paper reduces eye strainCONs-10x the price of the junky kids' notebooks but you get what you pay for here-Big and bulky but makes up for it with a large, comfortable writing surface",

                "reviewText": "In my first semester in my robotics program, my lab books were still in the mail. My instructor had some that he was selling for $20, so I bought one, and it was this book. I really like how thick the pages are, they don't bleed, although I have a few pens that will bleed through them occasionally. They're a good size and the grid layout is quite handy for keeping my lab book clean.The first book was a yellowish paper with blue lines, and I really liked those colors. But ever since then, the ones that I have personally ordered have white pages with the blue lines. I certainly don't prefer it to the yellowish, but it works just fine. The pages feel the same to me, just in a different color. The ones that I have ordered however have had a cheaper cover. I have a few that have the corners just falling apart from being in my bag, where the first one looks pristine.This is still my favorite book to buy for lab books. They're not too cheap, but compared to other ones that I have used, per page they're still cheaper, and I think that they have the best pages. I wish they'd go back to the old color, but it isn't a huge deal breaker for me. But I really do wish that they would have a more durable cover on them.",

Finally I saw a classmate using these notebooks and asked to check one out. A day later a ordered 4. Not only does the spiral notebook keep things infinitely more organized, but the paper quality is way beyond any \"green paper\" I have used. It is thick enough to erase multiple times, and even headings that I write in ink do not bleed to the back of the page.2 notes about this paper, however: it is slightly larger grid than \"green paper\" (4x4 vs 5x5) and it is not perforated at all. I actually prefer the larger grid and carry a small pad of green paper to use for assignments due to the lack of clean edges",
