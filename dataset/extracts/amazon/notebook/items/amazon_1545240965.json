I do half of my drawings on paper and the other digitally but i like all the space they give, soft but good paper material, and that the book itself is pretty low profile, its easy to fit in places. It doesnt have a crazy amount of pages for someone who may draw a lot everyday, but it does have a healthy amount of pages and they're even numbered. You can even draw on the cover(might want the tan version for that though), would use a pen for good measure. Only thing that makes it imperfect is that due to the design of thr stitching its hard to work on the back of the page because you cant get it to lay flat without the other side of the book falling on your hand. But thats obvious with this design.",

I like paper that when u write on it it doesn't impress on the sheet below or start to curl, also I like paper that doesn't blot when I use a fountain or marker-like pen, nor do I see the point of super fancy notebooks etc.. Hence, I use sketch books. But this is something I gave to a friend, he loves it, it checked all the right boxes, I liked it so much I got one for myself.

The sheets are thick, my Precise V5 pen doesn't bleed through as it would for cheaper paper. The paper also holds on to my pen in a nice responsive way.My only concern is the binding. Might not be an issue though since the fold occurs around a centimeter off from the spine. I'll post an update later. I'm not a big fan of the font they used for the front, a minimalist blank cover would be nicer.Overall, I recommend the notebook. It's a great price for what you get and I've always wanted to have a larger blank notebook.",

Regardless the notebook is so inexpensive in comparison to others I saw that I will just be using one leaf of each page anyway and then buy another when it is filled up.
