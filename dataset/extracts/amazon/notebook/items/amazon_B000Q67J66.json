        "description": "Experience the unforgettable, heartbreaking love story set in post-World War II North Carolina about a young socialite and the boy who once stole her heart -- one of PBS's \"Great American Reads\".Every so often a love story so captures our hearts that it becomes more than a story-it becomes an experience to remember forever. The Notebook is such a book. It is a celebration of how passion can be ageless and timeless, a tale that moves us to laughter and tears and makes us believe in true love all over again... At thirty-one, Noah Calhoun, back in coastal North Carolina after World War II, is haunted by images of the girl he lost more than a decade earlier. At twenty-nine, socialite Allie Nelson is about to marry a wealthy lawyer, but she cannot stop thinking about the boy who long ago stole her heart. Thus begins the story of a love so enduring and deep it can turn tragedy into triumph, and may even have the power to create a miracle...",

                "reviewText": "Sooo, I read this book in 2003 when I was in high school at age 17. As soon as I finished the book I knew my life had been impacted forever. The idea of an EPIC love grew within me and it changed the way I viewed relationships in our modern world. I grew up and stopped dating my high school sweetheart, Lester.In 2008 tragedy struck his life and has been away in a distant land separated from home and his loved ones. I think that ever since then I've avoided even watching the motion picture. Told myself that Epic Love is only written in Nicholas Sparks books and became angry at the men that came into my life.Well, throughout the years i always thought of that sad boy and what became of his life. All along I craved a love so pure and genuine like Lesters but never found it. We are now 34 years old. On June 14th, 2020 Lester came rushing back into my life. Well more like, I came rushing in like a hurricane if you ask him, bringing back old memories of a safer easier time.Our story began with a letter from him when we were 14 years old. Asking me if I wanted to speak on our parent's house phone. I was an overprotected child and if my mother found out I was speaking to a boy, she would make sure that I cut all connections with him. So we kept our (young love) a secret. We went to different high schools so he would sometimes ask his mom to drop him off at my high school so he could say hi and see me for 5 minutes. One day, Lester showed up with his mother wanting to speak with my mother about allowing us to date of course while always having a chaperone around us. My mother was soooo upset, but his boldness won her over and she agreed as long as we were being supervised. Years passed and we turned 17 and I wanted to experience different things. So we ended things and went separate ways.19 years later, we are in a loving relationship. As soon as we reconnected we just knew God had made us for each other. Our story is definitely not The Notebook, but it's a reminder that Epic Love does exist and it can withstand time and circumstances. We are also going to be writing our love story and how God rushed in and saved us both from living empty lonely lives. Right now, we are believing God for a miracle.In the meantime, while we wait for our circumstances to change and for God's mercy over his life. I sent him The Notebook. Noah and Allies story has brought a timeless love back to us. Through Nicholas Sparks words, we get to read about faith and destiny. To believe in the power of love and how two people so lost can find each other once again. I know Lester will be coming home sooner than we anticipated. This book meant everything to me while growing up. It gave me hope.I hope you guys enjoy your love stories. And if it hasn't happened yet, don't worry, your Epic Love Story will arrive and you will be glad you never settled.",

                "reviewText": "I know that it's a cliche to say that the book is better than the movie, but it's true for this. The book is just far better than the movie. For one, Noah and Allie are much better people in this than they are in the film. And interestingly, the entire book takes place either at the moment when Allie comes back to see Noah or when Noah is reading the story to Allie. The stuff about their past was original material for the movie, in order to make it longer.I said in that headlight that this is a cliched book, and it is, but I don't think that's a bad thing (mostly). It's a very simple book and the characters themselves are simple. I think it helps this way because it makes the characters easier to get into and understand. Plus, people in general can be simple.That being said, there's not a whole lot of depth when it comes to this story. While the movie tried to make it more complex, it did so at the expense of making the relationship toxic. Here, it's a lot simpler and straight to the point.It's hard to review this story without spoiling it, which sounds stupid as many people are aware of this story and may have already seen the movie, but I like to be save about it. It's a simple story about two long lost lovers finding their way back to each other. If you're fine with that, you'll most likely enjoy it. If you're looking for something more complex, you won't find it.I give this book a rating of 5/10.",
