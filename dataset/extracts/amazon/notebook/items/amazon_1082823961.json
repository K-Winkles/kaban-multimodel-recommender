The price is spot on for such a great product. I am giving 5 stars because what happened was by far not the sellers fault. My complaint is not with the products. My person who delivered my notebooks shoved them in my tiny mailbox. I live in a trailer park so the mailbox is tiny. This caused both of my books to warped and curled.",
