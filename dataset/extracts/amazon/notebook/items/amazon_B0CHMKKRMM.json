                "reviewText": "My son and I like this one-subject spiral notebook for different reasons.My son- Does NOT have the annoying blue triangles to the left of the red line that you see in the \u201cFive Star\u201d brand pages.Me- Good value price for a one-subject notebookOther excellent things about the notebook:1) Front cover AND the inside pocket folder are both plastic- good for longevity. In the Five Star brand, it\u2019s a mere paper folder.2) Pages are perforated for tear out and are college-ruled. Each page is standard 8.5\u201d X 11\u201d.3) 100 sheets of paper4) Note the ends of the spiral wire are bent inwards. No more snagging other stuff in your backpack.5) Three holes fit easily inside a 3-ring binder (make sure it\u2019s at least a 2 inch binder).6) Great value price for one notebook. Pages are of good thickness for writing with pen or pencil.Conclusion: Excellent value one-subject notebook. Some advantages over Five Star brand as mentioned above. It\u2019s even cheaper for one notebook, if you buy a pack of three. Going to buy these from now on to save money.",

It does what it says and gives you what you expect. The only two things that came to mind in terms of comparison shopping is that a positive is that it has 100 pages, most I've seen in the past have 60-75 pages, so this has a bit more. The negative is that even though this has more pages, it seems pricey - at $7 for 1 or $17 for 3, this seems high compared to others being sold on the same site.",
