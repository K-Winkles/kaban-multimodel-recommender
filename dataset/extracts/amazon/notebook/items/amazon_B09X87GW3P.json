It's still early as far as use, but so far, excellent!!",

                "reviewText": "The laptop is good for the price you pay. It has many excellent qualities. The speed is great. The like the keyboard and its lighting is excellent. It also is light enough to carry around and use on your lap. What I'm not crazy about is the screen. The colors aren't vibrant and that's because it uses the on board display adapter. It's adequate but nothing to write home about. Also, if you have a lot of peripherals, like I do, you'll need a USB Hub. It has the standard ports but only 2 standard USB ports and one type C USB port. So if you use a mouse and wired printer your done. I have a few external hard drives, a few flash drives and few things that need charging. I hate plugging & unplugging cables so I bought a 10 port powered USB hub to handle everything I need. It does have am HDMI port and a card reader. The card reader works, but it isn't the best. I'm use to card readers that are spring loaded. You push the card in until it clicks and to remove it, you push it in again and it pops out. Not so with this one. You push the card in until it stops to use it. To remove the card you have to try to grab the card and pull it out without the spring assist. It works, but it's cheap. I use to buy higher end laptops every few years. But since I use my phone more and more, I don't have the need. This is a very usable laptop if you don't need breakneck speed and you don't need high end graphics. I'm happy with this laptop because it fills my current needs, but I don't use it for high end gaming, watching movies or editing photographs. If I did, I'd buy a higher end laptop.",

The ability to turn on and off the backlight is a nice feature. There aren't any issues with the screen, given the work she does that is very important. I'm glad she in a position to do everything and still have the option to have a portable entertainment machine.",
