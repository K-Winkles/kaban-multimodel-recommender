                "reviewText": "Very sturdy and very pretty. The feeling of the paper isn\u2019t cheep feeling at all. The paper feels expensive and so does the actual notebook as well! Just feels like I paid lots of money for this when in reality it wasn\u2019t and I love that about these. I would recommend these and I have! I give them 5 stars !!",
