                "reviewText": "wanted an affordable but sturdy enough product with college ruled lines that had an attractive color system that i could use for note taking in my various online courses -- and the 6-colors gives me a chance to know at a glance which notebook to look for and use quickly. There are other brands out there that are much cheaper/thinner, and i am sure there are others out there that are fancier but unnecessarily pricey. This version and brand are JUST RIGHT like in the 3-bears story. It fits my price point, basic easthetic visual needs, and I CAN WRITE FAST on this, and LOVE THE tearable pages so if i want I can put something in a binder -- but, these are thin enough (but have enough pages for taking several hours of notes) that I can also fit them into a 3-ring binder versus have to remove the pages. They also fit easily into my manilla folders where I keep extra loose leaf notes on the same topic. THESE ARE NOW MY ESSENTIAL STAPLE TO HAVE AROUND THE HOUSE FOR NOTE TAKING ANY TIME. TRY IT! YOU'LL LIKELY LIKE IT!!! This is the price-point that matches the value of this product. I would not pay higher as this is a perfect match -- and, i will keep buying these over and over again cause it works on all the points I need this package to work. Try it! You'll like it, too! Especially if you like to also write on College Ruled!",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this 6-pack of spiral notebooks, and I'm quite pleased with my purchase. These notebooks offer fantastic value for their quality and versatility.First and foremost, the build quality of these notebooks is impressive. The covers are sturdy and protect the pages well. I've been using these for a few weeks now, and they've held up perfectly without any signs of wear and tear. The spiral binding is robust, ensuring that pages won't come loose or get lost over time.What I love most about these notebooks is their versatility. The size is just right - not too big and not too small. Each notebook contains a generous 100 sheets, giving me plenty of space for all my notes, sketches, and ideas. The paper quality is better than I expected for the price. It handles different pens and pencils with minimal bleed-through, which is a huge plus.The spiral binding allows the notebooks to lay flat, making them perfect for note-taking during meetings or lectures. I appreciate the perforated pages, which make it easy to tear out and share notes with colleagues or friends. Plus, the customizable front cover helps me stay organized, especially when using these notebooks for various projects.For the price I paid, this 6-pack of spiral notebooks is a steal. While they may not be top-of-the-line, they are certainly more than adequate for everyday use. If you're a student, a professional, or just someone who enjoys jotting down thoughts and ideas, these notebooks offer great value for money.My only minor gripe is that the paper could be a bit thicker to accommodate heavier ink applications, but it's a minor drawback given the overall quality and affordability of this pack.In conclusion, I highly recommend this 6-pack of spiral notebooks to anyone in need of reliable and budget-friendly notebooks. They are durable, versatile, and will undoubtedly serve you well for a variety of purposes.",
