I'm loving the wide staves and though there isn't a lot of paper, the quality is good and it doesn't tear; the music notation guide is VERY helpful as well. I gave this a 4 star instead of 5 star review because I find it irritating how their is very little room to write in any braces and it's difficult to erase pencil from the paper. It's overall worth the price.",

It does the job OK, but loses a couple of stars because the spaces could be even wider (if you're writing notes above or below the stave, there is not always enough room) and the book could be taller. The pages are quite thin but I didn't mind.",
