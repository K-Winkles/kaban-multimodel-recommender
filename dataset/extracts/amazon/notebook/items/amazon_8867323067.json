                "reviewText": "I have been using -Moleskine- for a few years now, and after having tried other brands for my journals or planners, I keep coming to Moleskine mainly for convenience. Last year I got my first -dotted- notebook (L) to use as a study journal, and I liked it so much I also switched to dotted pocket size for my daily planner.The paper is smoother than the plain version (those seem to have changed the paper, and i'm not a big fan, or maybe it was just a bad batch?). I have always used a combination of bullet points, arrows, mental maps, etc for my notes but now I write in a more organized and compact way, thus wasting less space on the page.The dots are visible enough to guide my writing straight, yet not strong enough to make me feel constrained by the grid. I can still comfortably draw freely on it.I have also tried the dotted -Field Notes- which I liked for their light weight BUT prefer the hard cover of MS as it provides a firm support for writing on uneven surfaces like my lap or holding it in my hand. I also like this paper better than FN as it gets my hand less tired. Its slight yellow tone makes the dots contrast less, compared to a white sheet (as in the FN). I consider this a good thing.The cover is very durable. Although my notebooks are very important for me and use them on a daily basis, I don't treat them carefully. So if you're like me and throw yours around or inside a messy bag while in a hurry, a hard cover is a must.There's a little pocket in the back but I don't use it much. And most brands of this kind are doing the same now, so it's not a factor for me when choosing a notebook.I use pens -Pilot Gtec- or -Pilot V5- mainly, but have also tried -Lamy- fountain pens and they all have worked fine, without much bleeding or spreading of the ink. Pencil won't work very well, there's not enough tooth for a good mark without pressing hard or having to sharpen every 10 seconds, BUT mechanical pencils (0.5mm or thinner) work fine. When using ink, you can see some of your writing on the next page due to the sheets being thin, but I got used to it already. Many people have complained about this fact, but if you want a paper that doesn't compromise on texture or thickness you'll likely have to pay more for a japanese or european-made notebook that could also be harder to buy or order more in the future.If you don't mind the price then I highly recommend this notebook, it feels and looks nice and elegant yet it is very simple. Plus there is a kind of satisfaction I get when I see mine filled-up and stacked. Maybe there are other cheaper options that work for your needs, but this is what's worked for me so far, so I will keep buying more in the future.I don't use Moleskine just for the brand; I'm not blindly following it without considering other options (for example, I prefer -Cottonwood Arts- for my sketchbook over MS) and I just hope my review helps you make a better decision on your purchase. Thanks",
