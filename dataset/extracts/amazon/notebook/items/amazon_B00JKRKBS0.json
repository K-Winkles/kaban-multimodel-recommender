                "reviewText": "I got some cheap on-sale notebooks from Walmart..they were a waste of money. The page size is smaller than these notebooks, so even though it might be 180 pages, it's not nearly sufficient writing area. The covers were crap (both the top and bottom covers fell off after a few months), the spiral gets bent, the pages tear out. I am hard on them, as I use them in a backpack, but the cheap ones I bought were garbage.These, on the other hand, are wonderful. The pages are large, the covers are extremely tough, and they're Meade... I've never had pages accidentally rip out of these, and they withstand the abuse of being slid in and out of my backpack repeatedly.These notebooks come with a feature that involves bending back three tabs to put them in a 3-ring binder and be able to flip it and use both sides of the paper without the rings from the binder getting in the way, and one can keep it stored in the binder (it makes more sense if you look at the notebook...the instructions are on the package, and I think there might even be a video online somewhere about how to use it). I've never used this feature, as I hate 3-ring binders...I very reluctantly use them to hold lined loose-leaf paper, and that's it. Three-ring binders were invented by the devil, I'm pretty sure.These spiral notebooks are the highest quality ones I've ever used. They might be more expensive than other notebooks with the same page count, but one must look at the page size, also (it's like buying toilet paper by the lowest price per square yards and ignoring that it's one ply. so you have to use 3 times as much), as well as the quality of the covers, spiral, and page attachments. This notebooks are great, and use the highest quality materials I've seen on a spiral bound notebook. Highly recommended!",
