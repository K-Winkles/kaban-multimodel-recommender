This time I ordered the purple, black and turquoise but instead received black red and a royal blue. I had a replacement sent and got the red royal and black again. Seems I\u2019m not the only one!",

                "reviewText": "These are great little casual notebooks. I bought them to scribble daily notes on one specific subject.They won't be notebooks I'll keep, as a personal journal or a Bullet Journal might be. Maybe I'll rip some pages out, maybe I'll transcribe or file some pages, but nothing has to be perfect or beautiful. They're mostly notebooks to use and discard.So as \"just a notebook,\" these work for me. Here are features I like:*Spiral binding means pages can be ripped out easily*There's a little perforation next to the spiral, so pages can be taken out neatly if desired.*The covers are just firm enough, and just flexible enough*The two little pockets in the front, one of my favorite features*Bright, pretty colors*College ruling*100 pages, just enough, but not too bulky* 5\" x 7\" is a great purse size.*The price is right",
