Sin embargo una vez en mis manos no vi la gran cosa. Es un cuaderno super sencillo, no es la gran cosa, aqu\u00ed en M\u00e9xico tenemos cuadernos con mejor calidad que estos, los cuales su \u00fanico atractivo es verlos en la TV y ya esta. Si buscas algo de muy buena calidad este cuaderno no es para ti, pero si como yo solo lo quieres por tener algo que vez en la TV pues adelante esta bien. Pero no esperen mucho.",

I bought it at a one off sale price of around \u00a33.00. I'd buy this item again but in bulk as it would be cheaper. The cover is a flexi cardboard and the size is around A5 or a little bigger. It's ideal for any notes and journaling. I always see this style in American movies/shows but I don't know why they are not popular in Britain...strange.",
