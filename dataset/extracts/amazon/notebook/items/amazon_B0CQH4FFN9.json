I was hoping a sheet of stickers would be provided, but that was not the case. This is only a notebook, and there are not any sparkly star stickers. \ud83d\ude22 Gotta purchase star stickers elsewhere. Fortunately, Amazon sells several types of the stickers separately.I do wish the product description would make it clear this is only the notebook, and sheets of stickers are not included.",
