No frills or cute designs but plenty of pages, decent spacing, good size (so many journals are tiny, which is tough if you want to have a journal record more and longer) and a built-in bookmark and perforated pages in case you need to find your place or take a page out. My only complaint would be that the pages are a tad thin so that when you write with a pen you can see the indentations on the other side, but I can live with that.",
