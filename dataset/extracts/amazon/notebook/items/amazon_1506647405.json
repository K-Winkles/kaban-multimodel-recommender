Since I only have lab once a week, I ended up only using about 30 sheets total for the entire semester, so this notebook will last me at least three semesters!! And it came really fast through prime so that's always great too. This is worth every penny!! It is well constructed and has some really useful diagrams/information inside the cover, along with a nice periodic table on the inside.I've used it for two semesters so far and it's holding up really well! Get this for your college chem labs!!",
