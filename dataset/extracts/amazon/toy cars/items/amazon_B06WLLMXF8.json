These are very well made, sturdy, not flimsy like other car makes. They are well worth the price and I like that despite the quality and the environmental impact these care have that they don\u2019t cost an arm and a leg. Again wish I discovered these sooner, it would have saved my son a lot of heart ache when cheaper manufactured versions fell apart.",
