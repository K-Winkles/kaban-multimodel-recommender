It appeared sturdy, but the small pieces that hold the vehicle up so you can ride the cars is extremely flimsy. The comparison of the child on the photo to the vehicle is extremely exaggerated. The vehicle is small. Not really made for a child that really wants to play with it. He still plays with it but I have to put something under the extension piece as it no longer stays up on the side holders. Would I recommend this...... Not really. Only if your child is an extremely calm and super careful kid. Good luck....",
