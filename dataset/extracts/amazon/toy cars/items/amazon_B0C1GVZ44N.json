She could chase them, hit them around on the tile floor and hear the noise of them, and then she could pick them up and carry them around to keep them away from me. Due to needing euthanized at 5 months due to a hind leg fracture not able to fix and needing amputation, they are now being used to give to smaller children at church with warning they are fragile and can quit working easily. The neat part about them is that although they can't be pulled back to run, after the mechanics quit working, they are still adorable little cars that can be played with in many ways. I would buy them again to give with the warning 'be gentle'. They are not very durable, but when they work, they really work.",
