                "reviewText": "My nephew really loves playing with this RC car. He loves that it moves fast and can do flips. That being said, I would always suggest supervision when playing with these cars. They are can go pretty quick and fly up. In terms of mobility, it does move pretty well. It can do some pretty nice turn and I love that it is able to easily turn around and flip. It does well on most terrains in the house. I have not tried it outside. I did not see it have any issues with leaving marks on hard surfaces. You could technically drive this on carpet but it is not exactly stable. It comes with two batteries so one can be charged while the other is being used. The battery honestly only really last up to 20 minutes on constant play.The recharge time is about a full hour to two hours. I would HIGHLY recommend you use a wall USB plug to charge the device. Computer and laptop USBs are very slow in charging. I am not a fan that the USB cable is different on the other end. It is unique so it will be harder to replace if the cable gets damaged. The controller is pretty nice. It does come with two AAA batteries. I did do a test on them to make sure they are full and they were. Regardless, I would recommend that you use rechargeable battery just to avoid needing to replace the batteries all the time. The controller is pretty easy to learn for my nephew and last for quite sometime considering it is just the controller. The connection is stable and for a good distance. It does not really require too much line of sight. The controller has a simple left right forward and back. It is nothing too special nor does it have any kind of \"jump\". It did not require any syncing from what I can tell nor does it interfere with other RC cars that my nephews had which is good.T he controls are okay. It is not the best quality and the controller feels a bit cheap. The car is nice in design and the wheels are relatively durable. I did not see any issues with it wearing down or coming off. The battery is easy to remove and install. It secures well so you do not have to worry about the battery coming off when the car movement itself is very quick and fluid. It can do some pretty crazy spins. The distance varies based on the battery of the car and the controller. It can go a pretty good distance before losing connection. Overall this is a good and simple RC car to have if you want something with a bit more \"tricks\". It is simple yet fun. It provides a good amount of entertainment (40 minutes at least) and could be something fun to race if you have two. The controller is not bad and easy to learn. I wish the cable was a type c or micro though because it would be easier to replace if something happens to the current one I am using.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great RC car for my son who's not yet very comfortable with direction and controlling fast moving remote control car. This car is perfect because it can move on both sides of the car, which means if you can stuck on a wall, it will flip upside down then go the other direction. There's nothing stopping this car anywhere, whether it's indoor or outdoor, thanks to soft cushioned tires.It also comes with 2 rechargeable batteries that are part of the car body so it's really easy to connect the battery. This means my son can play while non-stop with this RC car then simply replace the battery then continue to play while the other one is charging. The headlights on both top and bottom of the car lights up, which is also cool. You can do spin around trick, which is really cool. This would make a great Christmas gift for any children. Highly recommend it.",

I went looking for a new one, where I found this one, a better design, and I had to get one of these. I was not disappointed; this one works great. First off, it is very easy to set up and use. I like how once the batteries are in place, the remote instantly syncs to the car, and it is ready to go. I also like that it came with the batteries for the remote, so nothing else was out of pocket. Secondly, it works great. The car instantly responds to the car, and it can move left, right, back, and over, and it flips just perfectly and never gets stuck. I also like that it is fast and can not only grip slick floors and carpets but it can also go over anything outdoors. Lastly, nice batteries. I like that it comes with two rechargeable batteries, which can last for hours. I also like that once the battery is drained, the charger works really fast, too. No cons, it worked out great for me, and I am very happy with the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Everyone seems to enjoy playing with simple RC vehicles that are easy to operate and can go pretty much anywhere; my kids always liked them, my grandkids like them, and, quite frankly, my wife quite enjoys playing with them.This flip vehicle is perfect for young and novice racers! It employs just two forward/back switches (rockers) to control the car\u2019s actions making driving a simple task. The tacky grips of large tires allow the vehicle to handle obstacles with ease; my grandson loves to watch as it attempts to climb a wall, finally flipping over and continuing in the opposite direction. The car spins circles effortlessly and, with a little practice, does impressive one wheel rolls while travelling at full speed. The headlights are conveniently located on both the upper and lower side of the car allowing one set to always be easily visible. Night time play is a blast!It\u2019s nice to see a toy like this come properly equipped! The package contains two batteries for the car which yield close to an hour of driving time. In addition, you\u2019ll find the necessary USB charging cable, two AA batteries for the remote, a screwdriver for use in accessing the remote\u2019s battery compartment, and an instruction booklet. I really appreciate the fact that the remote control has a small light which indicates whether it is switched on or not. Fitting the rechargeable batteries into the car is best done by an adult; after engaging the battery in the port, the battery must be pushed downwards so that the two tabs on the bottom fit into the slots provided. When the battery is not fully inserted, it disconnects (though it does not fall out) whenever it encounters obstacles or a bumpy ride. The indicator light on the USB power cable makes it is easy to see when the car\u2019s batteries are fully charged. Like most RC units using 2.4 GHZ, the range of control is satisfyingly large.Whether played with inside or outside, this colourful little car is fast and fun! It handles obstacles easily and provides young RC enthusiasts with an entertaining drive! The car itself seems suitably durable and, with two batteries, provides enough driving time to make a walk over to the school parking lot worthwhile. At its current price of $32 CAD (with coupon) the unit is competitively priced and provides good value. Highly recommended!",

The controller has 2 buttons and it goes forward and backwards, there is no side to side control. I like this because it is simple. For someone who is just learning how to use this type of toy it is really easy to understand. Then, once you are accustomed to how to move it forward and backward, by using the buttons independently, you can make the car go in circles. There is a direct cause and effect situation, which, while simple, is fun.The wheels move in such a way as to be able to go over fairly sizable obstacles (sorry table leg). The car easily did flips, and then by using the buttons, it was set upright and on its way again. It crashed into a few chair legs, and the wall and did flips up and over backward, and there was no damage to the toy.The two battery packs are nice for non stop fun. The charger that is included, plugs into a standard USB block (not included) and the controller runs on 2AA batteries. It is clear when the device is on, so it's easy to remember to turn it off and save battery life.It is important to attach the battery pack firmly into the slots on the car. The first time I put it together, and then ran into the sofa, the battery pack partly popped out. There was no damage done to the car or the battery, but it might cause the car to stop if it were stopped very suddenly.I was able to make the car go in a straight line, very easily and then with a few pushes of the buttons, was able to make it do fast circles, forward and backward. The big wheels did allow for fun flips.It is possible to inch the car forward and backward by using the buttons with a delicate push. Two things on that.. first, is that smaller fingers will be able to use this as only a small amount of force is needed to make the car go, and second, the smaller, jerkier movements made the cat think it was something to chase. I was able to make the car tease the cat and the cat's pounce did no damage to the car, but the cat outran the car every time. Hilarity ensued.Fun for beginners, easy to use indoors and seems pretty sturdy for a plastic toy.",

                "reviewText": "This is one wild and crazy stunt car. It steers like a tank. One steering knob controls one side, (forwards and backwards) while the other controls the other side. I don't know how fast this stunt car goes, but the word slow is not in its vocabulary. There is no variable speed control. It's all out or nothing. So, once you're in motion, hang on, it's going to be a fun and wild ride.The body of the car is double sided. The side with the red headlights and the on/off switch is the top. The side with the blue headlights is the bottom. If the car is upside down, then the controls are reversed. It takes a while to get used to that. The photos show the two sides.This stunt car can fly over rough terrain and can turn on a dime. The manual explains how to do some of the stunts, but they're easy enough to figure out on your own. But it's best to be in an open area as you need room to maneuver this very fast little toy.The controller uses two double A batteries that are included. The car itself comes with two battery packs. There is a special charging cable that plugs into any USB type A charger. The charge light is on the cable itself. Not on the battery pack. Be sure to snap the battery pack firmly into place or it will pop off if the car hits an obstacle.I can't find anything negative about this RC toy. It would have been nice if they had included two charging cables as it takes longer to charge the battery than to run it down. But that's not enough of an issue to take away any stars. Therefore, this little RC Stunt Car gets a 5-star rating.",
