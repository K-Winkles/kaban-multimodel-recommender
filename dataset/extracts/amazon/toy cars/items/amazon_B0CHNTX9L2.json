The joy in his eyes and the concentration on his face were evident; these toys were more than just playthings; they were tools helping him develop his fine motor skills and understanding of cause and effect. Liam's imagination ran wild with the variety of cars, creating elaborate stories where each car had a unique role. Sarah joined in, delighted by the opportunity to engage and bond with her son. Together, they explored the world of these toy cars, each moment of play strengthening their connection. As the day turned to evening, Liam carefully placed each car back in the storage box.

                "reviewText": "This is an odd combination of little cars. There are two cars that are made for younger children, like 9+ months. There is a little plastic box with a lid that holds smaller cars, and these are definitely not safe for babies. I let my 9- and 12-month-old grandchildren play with the bigger cars, but they do have wheels that look as if they could come off in a baby's mouth and cause choking. They are what I usually stick in their hands while I change a diaper. One of the bigger car's has a \"tow\" on it and it came off when I accidentally stepped on it. I just threw the tow away, as it was also another choking hazard. Overall, I think these are best suited for children 3-years or older. I rated this collection four stars (and that's probably generous) because it should be two separate products.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased these to give to my two youngest grandchildren and I'm so pleased with how cute they are! There are six smaller ones and two a bit larger. The larger ones are pastel colored and have eyes that move when you push them forward and a soft, pliable silicone type material on the top that little ones can easily chew on. The six smaller ones are more vibrant in color with four of them (not the pink or red ones) having moving parts in addition to the wheels. In my opinion, these would be an excellent gift for any car loving toddler.",

I have hard floors, so there's plenty of space for him to play with them, but they do work on shorter piled area rug type carpets. I don't know if they'd work on regular carpet, the cars might just go slower? A good assortment of cars, he has these pigeon holed around the house, and always seems to pop up with one.",
