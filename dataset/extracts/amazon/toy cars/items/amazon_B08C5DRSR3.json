One of the boys received this tow truck as a gift but it caused arguments--and yes, my angels would fight over it. When my daughter asked me to buy the same one, I protested. She didn't want another because the first one was out of commission. She wanted it so the two biggest boys (still pretty little) could each have one. I get it. Lots of the little pieces are functional. Lights, sounds, hoist and cars to tow. . . it seems like everything works. The small size is perfect for those (usually) grubby little hands with fingers capable of getting into trouble with many things. So i sat down to play with them. . . we might need another one sooner than expected. :D",
