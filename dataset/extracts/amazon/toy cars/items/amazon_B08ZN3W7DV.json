Needed a little elbow grease to get the track into the designated slots but it's all good!Just make sure when you get the cars that the wheels are clicked into the metal rod. I had a couple that wouldn't go all the way down the track but realized they were just crooked but a simple fix!",

It is definitely cheap plastic that doesn\u2019t stay together and the cars are perfect size for my one-year-old to choke on them. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it is my fault for not paying attention to what I was Buying. Highly don\u2019t recommend get the wooden version instead",
