It curls around the car seat handle well and came with a little Velcro strap to make sure baby can\u2019t rip it off. This would be 5 stars if the curled part was made with soke sort of structure to stay spread out.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great gift idea! Three months old babies enjoy looking at black-and-white patterns. It makes sense that they didn\u2019t make the stroller hanging toy in different colors because newborns' color perception is limited to white, black and shades of grey. Their eyes and capacity for sight are not fully developed at birth. As a result, babies love to look at high-contrast black-and-white patterns, which stand out in their blurry worlds, attracting their attention and helping them focus. This hanging stroller toy will help babies develop their optic nerves, encourage cognitive development, without feeling over-stimulated. The toy arrived in a small box, which makes it easier to gift wrap it.",
