                "reviewText": "These things are TINY, between 1 and 2 inches long, but perfect for little tykes hands. The wind up on the spring doesn't take much to get some good distance on a flat, hard surface. However, the springs are not powerful enough to move up any incline. They will not even run across the nearly flat couch cushion because it's slightly convex, but on our wood floors a 2-3inch pull back will send it >8ft easily.Some of the articulated parts come off pretty easily. So if you have a munchy toddler, it could be a hazard. In general, we're happy with the purchase. You get so many that if a couple break or get lost you're not going to get upset.Warning: they hurt like HELL to step on. Beware if your kid likes to leave toy landmines.",

                "reviewText": "These cars are inexpensive, so I wasn't expecting anything great. I was pleasantly surprised with this product. Yes, they are made of cheap plastic, but that is understood because of the price. The quality of the plastic is slightly better than what you can find at discount stores. They work well and my daughter will love them. Her favorite thing to do is to put cars in her pant pockets and carry them around. I love that there is quite a few of them in the package. I can give them to her a little at a time. When one breaks it will mysteriously disappear and another will appear in its place. Overall, I am very pleased with this product and will probably buy some again",
