It's a good size for him, and the handle helps his grip.Now that that's out of the way, the main reason I'm reviewing this is to report the amazing customer service experience I had with Kid O. We bought one of the Go Cars a couple weeks ago, and two days later our Great Dane ate the tires off the car. Things like this happen constantly with the dog and yes, she's fine. So, I figured I'd have to suck it up and buy a new car or otherwise, let my son make due with the chewed, tireless wheels. Out of curiosity, I emailed Kid O to see if I could possibly obtain some replacement tires for the car. I got a response in a day, and although I was told that replacement tires weren't an option, the lovely woman told me they'd be happy to send us a new Go Car. I had no expectation of getting a replacement toy, nor was Kid O in any way obligated to do this. They just did it (with free shipping), which made me extremely happy. The replacement arrived the next day. I'll definitely seek out Kid O products in the future because of this experience (and because they make cool stuff).",

She likes to inspect the headlights and spin (and chew on) the wheels. She still has no interest in crawling, even when the car rolls out of reach, but I'm still happy with the purchase.

                "reviewText": "I bought this toy for my 10 month old boy who really loves toys with wheels. When he is at daycare, I can see him playing with trucks and cars pushing them around the whole room and never getting tired. Since every weekend he seemed to be bored a bit, I decided to get toys with wheels for his own.I don't like fancy shiny over-stimulating toys. So I usually avoid anything with batteries and too much buttons. And my boy also loves simple toys.When I ordered this one, I loved how it looks, I loved the smooth design and firm grip. It seemed to be the perfect car for my boy. However, there was one thing I ignored. The feedback from the toy.This toy doesn't have a haptic feedback when you push it around-which means the wheels are super smooth. It might be great for kids who like to push things away and pay, but my boy is the type who like to grab and play, which haptic toys make much fun.Other toys in daycare has this grrrr doodle daddle feeling when you grab and push it around on the floor, this makes it much interesting and motivates hime to crawl all around the floor. This toy is like 3 crawls and thats it. Nothing interesting going on.If you are searching for simplicity and simplicity only, this is the perfect toy for you. But if you want one more step from plain bricks and wheels, there might be something better out there.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this car. One of the answers to the questions on this product says this is a 3WD vehicle: two knees and one hand. Absolutely correct! This is the PERFECT car for a baby to toddler. As soon as my 9 month old got it he picked it up with a huge smile and just instinctively started to push it around and crawl with it. It rolls very smoothly on hardwood flooring and is a great size for baby hands. The handle is perfect and babies can easily pick it up. The color is vibrant and your baby will be drawn to it.If there is any drawback, and it's not the car's fault, it is that babies will love banging this car on furniture and such. So just be aware that this car isn't lightweight plastic junk. Highly recommended.",
