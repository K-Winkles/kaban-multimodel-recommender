This set of 4 trucks is perfect for any little boy who loves playing with cars and trucks. The push and go feature makes them easy to operate and keeps my son entertained for hours on end.The set includes four different trucks, each with its own unique design and character. The vibrant colors and detailed graphics make them visually appealing and engaging for young children. They are also made with high-quality materials, which ensures durability and long-lasting playtime.What I particularly love about these trucks is that they are friction-powered, so they don't require batteries or other power sources. My son can simply push them forward, and they will race across the floor, providing him with endless fun and excitement. The trucks also have a sturdy construction, making them perfect for indoor or outdoor play.In addition, these trucks are the perfect size for little hands to grip and play with. The smooth edges and no small parts make them safe for younger children, so I don't have to worry about my son getting hurt while playing with them.Overall, the CozyBomB Friction Powered Monster Trucks Toys for Boys are a fantastic toy for little boys who love playing with cars and trucks. They are well-designed, durable, and entertaining, making them a great value for the price. I highly recommend this product to any parent looking for a fun and engaging toy for their child.",

                "reviewText": "The other two are amazing! My four year old grandson is super into monster trucks and friction trucks are his favorite. These do tricks and for their size are really cool. He didn't want to give the other two up to have the broken one replaced. The price was good so we are keeping them instead of returning them. He's already asked for them in more colors and we will definitely buy more. These are my husband's favorite Christmas toy also!",
