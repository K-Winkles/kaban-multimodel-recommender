They said they were about the same size. When I got them, this one (pink for girl), cost a lot more money, but this one was skinny and everything was cheaper made and much smaller than the other one!! Very disappointed, but it was a gift. They opened them at the same time, two different Mom\u2019s. I was embarrassed! I\u2019m just glad my daughter got the cheaper one and daughter-in-law got the better one.",
