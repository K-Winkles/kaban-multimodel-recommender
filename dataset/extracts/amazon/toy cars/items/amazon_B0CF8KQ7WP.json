The only drawback is the placement of the small on/off switch on the bottom of the car, which can be a bit inconvenient. The original cars had a larger, easily accessible button on the top of the cars that made it easy for little hands.

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased these light up cars for my son, and I must say, they have been a huge hit! My son absolutely loves playing with these toys, and the lights add an extra level of excitement to his playtime. As someone with sensory issues, he is drawn to anything that lights up, and these toys have been a perfect gift for him. The lights flicker while they are driving, which adds an element of fun and captivates his attention. Seeing the joy on his face as he plays with these toys is truly priceless.The only downside I have noticed is that these toys drain the batteries quite quickly because they constantly run. However, this is a minor inconvenience compared to the hours of entertainment and happiness they bring to my son. I highly recommend these cars to parents looking for a toy that will keep their little ones busy and engaged, especially if they have sensory issues. 10/10",
