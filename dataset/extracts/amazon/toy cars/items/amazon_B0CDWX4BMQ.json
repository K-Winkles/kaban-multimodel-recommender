                "reviewText": "My son is OBSESSED with Cars!! We have almost 200 diecast cars and he still asks for different ones every day haha. It can definitely get expensive, especially when he starts asking for the hard to find ones that go for WAY more than they originally were sold for, like Frank!!He\u2019s been asking for Frank for a while, so I was super excited to find this ZXIHYYN Cars 2 Movie Character Harvester Frank 1/55 Metal Die Cast Toy Car!!! Little did I know, my husband also found a \u201creal\u201d used Frank the same day I ordered this one.I truthfully wouldn\u2019t know the difference between this dupe and the real one if we didn\u2019t get the \u201creal\u201d one at the same time. You can see the differences in the pics above (this listing is on the left in the pics where the \u201creal\u201d one is on the right). That \u201creal\u201d one goes for over 60 on amazon right now! Where this one is 17!!If you\u2019re not getting this as a collector item and getting it for your kid to play with, this is definitely the way to go!! Yes, there are some differences, but again, I wouldn\u2019t have known the differences if my husband didn\u2019t find the \u201creal\u201d one! And my son definitely doesn\u2019t know this is a dupe!Super happy with it and am excited to see what other \u201chard to find\u201d\u2019 Cars this company comes out with! (Damaged Mood Springs, please!!! Haha)",

It\u2019s just poorly made and dang for $16 bucks a pop I would think that I\u2019m getting my moneys worth but within 1 hour of play it fell apart! I thought maybe screws had come out but upon further inspection, it\u2019s not even Screws holding it together. Just some small prongs. I can\u2019t see this holding up for any child, heck 1 drop to the concrete and it\u2019s over with!!!!What a disappointment. Frank is my son\u2019s Favorite and we let him open this up last night because we just couldn\u2019t wait. Oh you should\u2019ve seen the excitement on his face and the agony when it randomly came apart while he was playing with it. My son is 2.5 ,he isn\u2019t that strong - he weighs maybe 28 lbs. the only think I could think of was that he put too much weight on Frank when he was stopping and turning Frank around to chase McQueen and the thing came apart.I\u2019m returning in hopes to find a better quality Frank. Apparently this is the knock off anyway.I hope this helps someone.If you take a chance and order this one, take a look at the bottom. If it is not screwed in then the chances of you having a similar scenario is highly likely",
