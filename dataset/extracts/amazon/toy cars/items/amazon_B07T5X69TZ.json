I bought it anyways because I thought it would be okay, due to the cheap price.Wow! All I can say is I was so wrong. He has been racing, dropping, and playing with it for 5 months now and it is still kicking. I am personally not into cars to his extent, but it is so well made, and beautiful, I would appreciate it as a gift. It is a work of art and durable. I will be getting more cars from this maker in the future. We are very pleased. Even if it falls apart tomorrow, it will be worth it. It has stood the test of time of a three year old!",
