Children can get right to work with these tools and parts that are designed for young hands. The nifty powered screwdriver works just like the grown-up version, turning in two different directions to loosen and tighten connectors. It includes three different bits to fit the roadster's various connectors, helping teach children pattern matching and mechanical skills. Once the roadster is complete, they can take it for a spin around the room-and then it's time to check the engine! Just flip the switch to change the screwdriver's direction to easily unscrew piece after piece until there's nothing left but a pile of 18 parts. This toy is perfect for ages three and up.

                "reviewText": "The Battat Take-Apart Crane Toy Truck Playset seems like a GREAT idea at first. The colors are fun and bright and the toy itself is very sturdy. My son (2.5 years old) loves to feel like he's actually building something with his tools (whereas usually we just pretend to \"fix\" things around the house with other tool toys) and the number of pieces (34) are just enough to give him a challenge to building, but not so many (or small) to be overly complicated or time consuming to assemble.My only COMPLAINT is the drill itself does not have enough torque to actually tighten/loosen the bolts and screws to assemble or disassemble effectively. I found myself \"hand\" tightening or loosening everything in both instances which kinda ruins the fun of the toy.Overall... the toy is fun and the fact that I'm constantly tightening/loosening for him doesn't seem to bother him. But for me, the tool leaves me wanting a bit more, unfortunately.",

                "reviewText": "Gave this to my granddaughter. She loves it and opened it first, she's almost 3 years old. After her family went home her mother told me they must have lost a part that holds a wheel on since it was there when she played with it at my place. I emailed the company to see if they had the part and if I could possibly buy it. I received a replay that said they received my email. Within a week, the part arrived in the mail - no charge. How often does that happen?? I recommend their toys and think it is important for both boys and girls to learn how to put things together, this one comes with a battery operated drill and is fun for them to use.",
