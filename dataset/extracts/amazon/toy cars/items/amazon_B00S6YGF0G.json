                "reviewText": "This little car is cute and great for babies. The manufacturer is 5 stars out of five in my book. I would have given it a 5 star rating if I had actually received the exact little blue car that was in the picture (the light blue one that has the spoiler). I already have the model of car that I recieved and I wanted a different model with the same color from this wonderful maker. But was very disappointed to find a different car than was pictured. All in all, I would tell this manufacturer to advertise the ACTUAL car that customers will receive inorder to get the great ratings that this product deserves.However we also bought the bundle package with the mustang and other car and they came on time and as pictured. These cars are a great addition to ones toy box.UPDATE!! I just ordered two of the blue cars and a red car for a birthday present and the cars that were pictured was exactly what came. These are great little cars and so I am changing my rating from 3 to 5 stars.",

I wish colour was able to be chosen as I would buy a second in blue.I would say the best way to clean it would be to either run it under the tub fosset at full pressure or use the shower head. It does have lots of little crevices. That are going to get dirty because they can stick your fingers in it and hold onto it.",
