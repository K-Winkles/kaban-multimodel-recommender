                "reviewText": "This play arch with toys is lots of fun for little ones. I got it initially to attach to my MamaRoo swing since its original pole with toys got broken off. It works great and my baby loves it. It\u2019s very interactive, has music and cote sounds. The submarine besides sounds and music has lights in the middle which my baby enjoys a lot. I got the crab version(found it more suitable for a boy). The shark and crab have sensory fabrics which make sound when baby touches and plays with them. The flower spins when you pull the toy attached to it, it\u2019s fun when my baby is Abe to grow to that skill. I also found that I can easily attach it to my stroller and car seat, the attachment parts work on versatile handles and rails which is a huge plus. Love this interactive fun play arch with toys and highly recommend it to mamas with small kiddos.",
