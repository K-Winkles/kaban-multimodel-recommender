I gave 4 stars, because the friction has stopped working several times on some of the cars. Thankfully, it has been a fairly easy fix. Take off the body of the car and push the mechanism back into place. Even though it is an easy fix, I wish it were a fix that wasn't necessary.",

I had to pop the top off the red one once and line the little gears back up, but that was a 2 minute fix and it's been ramming into baseboards non-stop since.Highly recommend these toy cars.",
