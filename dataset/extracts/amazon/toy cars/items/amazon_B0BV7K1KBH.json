The best part is this will continue to evolve with him phase after phase as he learns more cause and effect. Great purchase!!",

We are constantly on guard to catch him with the closest iphone or ipad cord, electrical cords, etc. Not sure what the fascination is, but this toy helps to redirect his interest. It has multiple cords going through a base. You can pull the cord all the way through to one side, flip it over and pull it back through again. He tends to chew on it as well. My husband has even used one of the cords on it to tie onto his walker so he has it handy to play with. We actually have 3 of these so one is always available.",

He really does like it. The middle round piece is hard plastic and slightly heavy, so with a young baby it would likely hurt if they hit themselves with it. I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s recommended for 18 months. So I try to keep an eye on him when he\u2019s playing with it. But other than that, it\u2019s great and works for his age just fine. I think it\u2019s a toy that will be played for a couple of years hopefully!",

Only downfall is the suction does not hold so the toy falls quite a bit. There is a nice option to take the suction portion off so that is why I would still give this toy a 5 star rating.",
