This is not an end all, be all but it has helped drastically! I had a mirror thing when I first bought to see him, and both worked fine together. I\u2019ve since then upgraded to a camera to see him better and they still work well together! No safety or installation concerns either.The squirrel is his absolute favorite toy. It\u2019s not your average squeaker.. it\u2019s more like a chirping? I don\u2019t know, but he LOVES it!Anyway, love this product, worth the price for us!",

BUT I had to alter it to make it work, as the strap to secure it is incompatible with a fixed headrest. It's far too short to go around a fixed headrest, so I tied it around with string and then saftey pinned it to the seat back fabric to be sure it would stay. I'm ok with this alteration as she loves it so much.",

                "reviewText": "This is such a cute thing to have in the car. I got it bc, unlike the other choices, this could be used with a mirror. It doesn\u2019t boast that ability specifically in the listing but based on pics of this item and reviews/pics of other items that clearly DONT accommodate the mirror, I presumed it would work.Things realized once it\u2019s actually Been in use:1) it working with a mirror is..... iffy. The mirror Does in fact stay up and this item fits nicely with the mirror on. Great. Except the center support strap for the toy prevents the mirror from resting nicely and causes it to slide to the side and becomes unusable. It is quite possibly my mirror that is just not stable enough and a new mirror will need to be Purchased. I will have to mess around w it and see what can be jimmied up to secure it better. But in case you were like me and got this bc of the mirror thing, just know that it might not be perfect. It\u2019s like it works 95% w the mirror I have, but the 5% not working is a big 5% lol2) the round bar that comes out With the toys attached is basically like a giant foam handle bar for my sons hands and feet. He rips at it and kicks it and not only does that exacerbate the mirror problem mentioned above, but it tangles him up in the whole thing, the toys slide down to the sides and there goes the whole purpose of having it. For almost $40 I wanted these two issues to not exist at all, never mind together, within 5 min of using it, and every time thereafter lol. It\u2019s up and it\u2019s there and he plays with it for sure but it\u2019s definitely become this added thing For me to adjust and readjust with every car ride.Update: the mirror has been secured a bit better and my son has calmed down w the kicking bc it\u2019s not new to him anymore. At this point I don\u2019t even think about it anymore he just goes in the car and played with it nicely.",

Then a few weeks later, she realized she could kick and reach it and it was amazing! She can't get any of the toys to her mouth, which I love, but she pulls them, hits them, kicks them, and makes them make their noises. She has not screamed in the car for no reason since I put this in the car. Worth every penny (even though I don't see why it's so expensive).",
