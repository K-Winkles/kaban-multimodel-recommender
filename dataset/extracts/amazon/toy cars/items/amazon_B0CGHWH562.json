Well, I didn\u2019t need those other gifts at all! He LOVED this little car. It does a lot of cool things. He\u2019s 9 and he played with it for hours.",

My son is 22 months and has a blast playing with it. Since he can't control it that well, the demo and spin buttons are an easy way for him to interact with it. The car is also fairly small and just the right size for him to play with.",
