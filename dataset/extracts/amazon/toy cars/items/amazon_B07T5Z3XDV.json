However, it is possible to remove the trunk from the police car. Though it doesn't take away from the play-ability of these toys.The minor complaint I have about these toys is the lights. They don't represent American emergency vehicles. I mean the ambulance and fire engine, have two blue lights and the helicopter has a search light and rear propeller light. And they're all DIM! Though kids might not care about these minor details as much as me, LOL",
