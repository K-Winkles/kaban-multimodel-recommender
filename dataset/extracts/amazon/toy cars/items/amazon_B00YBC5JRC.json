        "description": "The model measures about 5 inches long by about 2 inches wide by about 1.5 inches high. It has very nice details such as separate clear plastic headlights, taillights, grill, turn signals, etc. The coloring is done in gloss finish with accurate markings and branding. The wheels are free rolling and made of rubber. Moreover the back wheels have pull back action, which means that it will wind up when you pull it back and it will roll if you let it go. The rolling motion is very smooth so be mindful of where you display it (or chuck the wheels). The doors can open revealing nice interior details such as accurate seats, steering wheel, and instrument panel. These models are about the size of a regular computer mouse. The detail and accuracy of the model is very impressive. These models don't sacrifice on detail or quality to size. These are very realistic models. They do not have individual window boxes. They will be expertly packed and shipped in a generic box.",
