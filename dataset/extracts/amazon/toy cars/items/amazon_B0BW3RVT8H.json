                "reviewText": "100% recommend. There\u2019s really nothing to dislike about these hanging toys. My baby was immediately drawn to these, I think due to the high contrast colors and sound they make. This was actually the FIRST toy that he reached for/grabbed/tugged at/held. He had a lot of other hanging toys on his exercise mat, but he wasn\u2019t as engaged by them as these. These each come with a clip so you can hang them anywhere\u2014exercise mat, at the high chair, on the car seat or stroller, side of the crib. I\u2019ve even removed the hook and have just let him hold the toy and shake it. They are so soft and the Size is great as well. The sound these make are so different. The Wind Chime description is pretty accurate. It does not sound like a normal rattle. It is definitely more like a wind chime, which I don\u2019t mind. It\u2019s actually pretty soothing to hear. It also says to hand wash these, but I actually put these in the wash and they washed and dried just fine. I probably wouldn\u2019t recommend frequent washes in a machine, but the one wash I did so far did not harm the product. This is my baby\u2019s favorite toy (he favors the lion over the elephant for some reason). I highly recommend this product and would buy it again.",
