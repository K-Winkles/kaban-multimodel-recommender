            "Wooden car toys are not only beautiful and eco-friendly but also durable and safe for children of all ages. Furthermore, wooden toys are durable and can last for generations. While wooden toys may be more expensive than their plastic counterparts, they are definitely worth the investment.",
            "Although plastic toys are considerably cheaper and easier to produce, when they're no longer wanted they do a lot more damage to our planet when compared to their wooden alternatives. Wooden truck toys are sturdier, last longer, and can become family heirlooms passed down from generation to generation.",
            "A beech wooden toy is very soothing and not only appeals to the child's sense of touch. Research shows that children are calmer with beech wooden toys than with any other material. Exploring and playing with toys made from natural materials allows children to slow down and probe the qualities and possibilities of play.",
            "The dimensions of the wooden cart are 2.76*1.62*1.42inch, these little cars are small enough to bring along wherever for your toddler goes! The vehicles in this set encourage hand-eye coordination and imaginative play. All 6 pieces are brightly colored, easy to identify, and fun for kids to grasp and maneuver.",
            "If you\u2019re curating a collection of early childhood items with as few plastics and synthetics as possible, wooden toys are a wonderful investment. They\u2019re sturdy enough to be passed on for generations and simple enough to inspire imaginative play\u2014without all the overwhelming lights and batteries of their plastic counterparts."

                "media_text": "Q: Are wooden car toys worth the money? A: Wooden car toys really are cheaper \u2013 because it can be used much longer than to make cheaper toys out of other materials. Instead of having to buy the same toy ten times, a wooden toy can survive up to a decade. That means the higher price is worth it in the long run! Q: Are wooden cars more durable than plastic cars? A: Wooden cars are generally more durable than plastic cars as they are made from stronger materials. They are less likely to break or crack, and can withstand rough play. Wooden cars are also less likely to fade or discolor over time, which means they will last longer and can be passed down to younger siblings. Q: Can wooden cars be used for educational purposes? A: Yes, wooden cars can be used for educational purposes. They can help children develop their fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and spatial awareness. Wooden cars can also be used to teach children about colors, shapes, and sizes. Additionally, wooden cars can be used to encourage imaginative play and storytelling, which can help develop a child's language and communication skills.",

They remind me of my son's Thomas the trains circa 2000. I love the colors, very cheerful.My family and I are visiting a refugee camp soon and are collecting toys to take to the children there. I am sure which ever child receives these will have many hours of fun. Plus they are small enough to carry one in each hand.I would have given them 5 stars if the paint details on the cars I received matched the paint details on the advertisement. There isn't a ladder painted on top of the firetruck and the taxi doesn't have black and white checks, rather white and orange. Small details that make the toys special but doesn't deter from the fun.",

                "reviewText": "An den sechs Holzautos gefallen uns besonders die hochwertige Verarbeitung und lebendigen Farben, die sofort ins Auge fallen. Dank ihrer Abmessungen von 7 x 4,2 x 3,6 cm sind sie perfekt f\u00fcr kleine Kinderh\u00e4nde. Obwohl es schade ist, dass sie nicht auf die Standardholzschienen passen, tut dies der Spielfreude keinen Abbruch.Die angenehme Haptik der Autos macht sie besonders f\u00fcr kleine H\u00e4nde ansprechend. Sie bestehen aus Buchenholz und fassen sich wirklich angenehm an. Die R\u00e4der sind aus Plastik und rollen gut \u00fcber verschiedene Untergr\u00fcnde.Trotz dieser positiven Aspekte bleibt der Preis ein kritischer Punkt. W\u00e4hrend die langfristige Investition in nachhaltiges Spielzeug verlockend ist, k\u00f6nnte der aktuelle Preis f\u00fcr einige K\u00e4ufer abschreckend wirken.",

As you can see they fit perfectly in our wooden garage and go down the ramps and in the lift easily.The vehicles themselves are well made with no sharp edges, unfinished or loose parts.
