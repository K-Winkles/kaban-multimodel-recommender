Have never rusted, lost a wheel, anything\u2014these things are seriously indestructible!We keep one in our diaper bag at all times.

Son de muy buena calidad y aguantan todas las palizas y golpes que mi hijo les da.Debo decir que el tipo de pl\u00e1stico no es el mismo que el del resto de veh\u00edculos grandes que he comprado, pero, a\u00fan as\u00ed, el pl\u00e1stico es resistente. Los otros son de pl\u00e1stico reciclado y color mate, este es m\u00e1s brillante, pero estoy igualmente encantada y mi hijo m\u00e1s.Son muy coloridos, de buen tama\u00f1o y van muy fluidos al lanzarlos.Teniendo en cuenta la gran cantidad de juguetes que tenemos y, justo todos los de esta marca son sus favoritos.Como digo en cada rese\u00f1a de producto que compro, repetir\u00e9 seguro.",
