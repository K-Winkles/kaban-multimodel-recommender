                "reviewText": "You need to have extremely clean floors before using this toy. The wheels will pick up all dust, hair etc that you miss. Once collected by the wheels dust will go inside and scratch up the clear plastic near the wheels. This happened rather fast after the first use on freshly swept floors so I would not say the plastic is very durable.You can remove the bottom screws and clean, but the inside components, two big gears and the engine area with the pistons are just sitting there, they are not secured, so if you aren't careful you will have to reassemble them too. Not difficult just put it all back the same way it was. If you want to keep it clean you will have to do this. I love clear electronics, but I think it could have been made to keep dust out a little better. Like wheel wells that separate the wheel area from the rest of the inside of the car.The car has an auto drive kinda of like a robotic vacuum cleaner. If it gently touches anything in the front it automatically changes the direction it is driving in. It's normal path appears circular. It's motion is a slow cruise so it's not going to run anyone over. You can arrange almost anything around a space to make a barrier for where you want the car to drive, it won't even run over a thick washcloth. The clear plastic shell covers the wheels so fingers will not get caught.It has two different short songs, which are both very cute and loud. We call it \"Party Car\" for this reason. There is a honking sound when the music changes. Lot's of lights, Moving Gears it looks really cool and impressive for the price. Everyone likes watching it and dancing to the music There is a stationary/silent mode where it only lights up and doesn't move.Even though it's not perfect it seems like the person who designed it was rather thoughtful, which is rare these days. Even the box it came in was embossed with the car and gears. A pack of 3 AA batteries and a screwdriver were included. Batteries lasted about 24hrs. I recommend some rechargeables.",

So you don't have to buy anything extra to assembly it. I wish it went a little faster but the fact that it works and my 1yo loves it, I'm happy with that. He even cried when I took it away which he only does when he loves something. But overall the toy is amazing and reminds me of the see through phone that we had in the 90s.",

My nephew (1 1/2) is really into cars and trucks and loved this car when he opened it up.It lights up, plays music, and you can see the gears moving around inside of it. It has a sensor that turns it around if it bumps into something. Doesn't work well on carpet.He might get another one for his birthday in June because I know this one is going to go \"missing\".Great for kids that don't live in your house!",
