When I first got them I thought they were smaller than I expected and also felt really cheap. but after a few months they have mostly still held up (though for a boy mine is pretty gentle over all). He likes to play with them and I will often throw a couple in my purse or diaper bag to have on hand when we are out and about. over all I would say pretty good value for the money.",
