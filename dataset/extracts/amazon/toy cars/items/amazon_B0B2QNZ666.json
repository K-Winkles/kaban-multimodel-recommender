My 2.5 year old is rough as can be with his toys but these bad boys keep up with him. Only problem is there\u2019s not enough, we have two big boxes of them and he thinks we need more lol",

I built the little house in the picture, along with a barn for his animals, and garage for the tractors. However, only the house remained after he tripped and fell on them. Definitely recommend!",

For exampe it comes with only 4 of the tall pointy triangles and I counted 28 in the picture. The subsequent pics are more realistic. There aren't enough pieces included to make all the suggested ideas that are demonstrated in the book. We love them so we are ordering another set to be able to make more things.",

Thus I change from 2 to 5 stars.I was so excited to find a set of magnetic tiles for a good price but was very disappointed when I found that they don't magnet together very well and the structures that you build are not very sturdy even if it's just a basic cube. I ordered them early for Christmas so it was past the window to return them by the time we opened them on Christmas. If you try to build a ramp structure the magnets are placed in such a way that there are big divets so it's not a smooth enough surface for the car to drive over.",
