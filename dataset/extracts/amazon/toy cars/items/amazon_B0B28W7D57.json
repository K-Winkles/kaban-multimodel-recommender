They love to race each other and see who can do obstacles the fastest. Its a simple rc, not too fast and not too slow, works best on hard surfaces, not carpets. Its a great gift idea as it isnt expensive and actually works well. It seems like itll be able to withstand some wear and tear. Looks like a win as thy wont seem to stop playing with it.",

                "reviewText": "When the product arrived, I realized I hadn't paid attention to the size of the car in the description. The photos made it look pretty big. That said, for a car as small as this, it they paid attention to detail. It looks like a nice model of a Lamborghini.The controls are pretty traditional. You can adjust wheel alignment, and move forward, reverse, and side to side. It is a pretty quick little car too. On a full battery, it can quickly go wherever you want to send it. I tried it on carpet, linoleum, and cement, and it performed well on each. There was a noticeable loss of speed on carpet, but it was still functional.My main problem with this car is the remote. It feels really cheap, and contrasts significantly with the quality of the car. I feel like the controller came from the 99 cent store. It doesn't feel sturdy, and the recessed directional controls aren't as easy to use as the standard joystick style. The remote looks pretty different from the one depicted in the operation manual, so it seems that the remote might vary per shipment. That is just speculation, but it seems interesting to note.Overall, this is a nice, quick little car. It is nice to look at, and fun to operate. As long as the remote stays intact, I think I'll get quite a bit of use out of this car. Hopefully the remote can be replaced when the time comes. Otherwise, it will end up being just a nice model car, which isn't so bad.",

Build quality is really good and it can take few hits on to the walls still remain strong. Quite impressed with the car and it will be lot of fun not just for kids but adults too. Pretty looks of the car makes it usable a showpiece too. Rubber tires are really good and able to stop car even on a smooth surface as you can see in the video. Speed is really good and it has potential to give tough competition to other Remote Cars. Having regular removable batteries makes it convenient as you don't have to wait for them to get charged unlike other cars. Happy with the purchase",
