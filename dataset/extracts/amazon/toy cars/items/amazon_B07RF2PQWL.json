What I don't like is you can't put the cars in the truck when it is right side up it's hard to keep the cars in possession so you have to trun the truck on its side as you put the cars in one at a time. I don't think the car are durable and they will eventually break.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Oh man, this is the best thing I've probably bought in a long time.My son, like most boys, loves loves watching construction and trucks.These little construction trucks and workers are the best! And I love that they can travel across the floor on their own. The little men are a bonus in my opinion.The trucks do articulate a little. Fair warning two of the trucks have two little pieces that tend to fall off (the ladder and bucket) we have put the bucket back on a couple times on the digger and then just took off the ladder on the other one.My son didn't even wait for me to open the package. We were packing to go on a trip when it came and before I knew it he had the package opened and tried to fit all six cars and four men in his little chubby hands. We already misplaced one of the men because he wanted to take them everywhere he goes. Love this so much!Thanks a lot for starting a forest fire of desire for other pull back construction toys and cars like these.Update: This has been the toy that has captured my son's attention the longest. He has taken them everywhere he goes, including the bath, and they have held up really well. We've lost a little ladder, the scoop bucket, and the tailgate off of the trucks but he still loves them and plays with them regularly. Super big win here.",
