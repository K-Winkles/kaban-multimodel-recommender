                "reviewText": "I actually bought this one on sale just to go in the living room toybox for when company comes over with little ones. These Green Toys are absolutely the best, hands down! What's not to love? The minute you recieve one you relize the substantial and durable quality of them. They are easy to clean and I literally can not fathom any saftey hazards whatsoever with these toys (other than if the are used as a projectile, but that is the case with most toys that are not fabric, so obviously if there is a baby in the bunch with some older toddlers or so, you should still have your eyes on the kids). I love that they are all dishwasher safe for sterilizing. We have decided to keep all the Green Toys in a toy box in our main livingroom for 2 reasons. When we have company with children or playmates visiting, they can all just dive into these toys and we don't have the aggravation of my grandson's other toys being dragged out with multiple pieces, and those are not all small child safe, and we can not just throw them in the dishwasher afterwards as we can these. These are literally worry free toys when children are visiting (other than the aforementioned throwing, or maybe banging over the head, so yes you still must parent as we should be anyway). Second, after dinner, when there is just a small window of time for bath and playtime before bed, these are hassle free and the only toys we let him drag out because they are simple and easy pickup. BONUS, they are MADE IN THE USA, and of completely recycled materials. I have not seen that many quality toys like these other than ones made in the 1940's or so, where good craftsmanship (as these are) mattered, even in a toy. We have at least 2 dozen of these toys and they have become an awesome gift item especially when they go on sale, which is often. They are literally the PERFECT toys!",
