It says 100pcz but you're only getting like half of that in magnetic tiles. You have alphabet parts that alone is 26pcs, you got some wheels and non-magnetic connecting parts. The magnets feel a little fragile if I'm being honest. It's a REALLY good toy overall I just don't think I want to pay that much for this again. The toy alone I would give 5 stars but the price isn't 5 stars worthy",
