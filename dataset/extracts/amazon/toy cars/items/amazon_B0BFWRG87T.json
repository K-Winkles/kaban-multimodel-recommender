                "reviewText": "When I first pulled the battery tab, it was acting really weird (random noises at random times). So I took the battery out and put it back in and then it worked perfectly. I didn't actually get any engine noises like others, but maybe I didn't play with it long enough. When I push the hood down it would make a high pitched \"beep beep\" like a car locking. When opening the doors it cycled through a couple of sounds. I opened it up, and the 2 yellow wires on the very front of the car are connected to the speaker. If you pull/cut one of them you'll have no sound. This is better than pulling the battery because the lights still work, but silently. If you want to put sound back, you'll need to re-solder the wire. There's probably not enough room for a wire nut.The rims on this model do not seem accurate, and they are not like the picture. Both the Amazon listing and what I received are not model x rims. What I received looks better than pictured, and it's fine. I'm not alone, look at everyone else's pictures, I have the same wheels as them. The panel gaps are pretty good when the doors are fully shut. Mine looks as good as the other reviewer's pictures. The amazon listing picture makes it look worse than it is.My guess is that all these models on amazon are basically the same except the wheels/rims. So I got the cheapest one. If you can get it for under $15 it's a good deal IMO.",

Not the most ideal toy for young ones because if a mirror breaks off (which it did for us because he threw it once) then it becomes a choking hazard, but for him it is a perfect toy!",
