                "reviewText": "Overall, this is a good toddler toy. My two-year-old likes it a lot. Here are some pros and cons:Pros: It's easy to assemble; the \"puzzle\" pieces are all the same shape so a kid can connect them any way they want. The little car moves pretty well through the track.Cons: You have to apply the decals to the little road signs, which are kind of pointless anyways. My kid has no interest in them. And on this particular set, the airplane wings knock them all over. Also, I really wish they included two or three little cars with each track set.I found my toddler had the most fun with this toy when I combined two sets together. That way, there was more track to use and two cars on the track \"racing\" each other instead of just one.",

They worked well once assembled, the car stays on the track better than I thought it would. They really are pretty good little toys. The only drawback for me was that the pieces seem larger in the pictures than when you actually see them in person. But I guess that's marketing! ;-) Anyway my granddaughter likes it and can set it up herself so that's the important thing. I would recommend.",
