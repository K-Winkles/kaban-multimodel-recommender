                "reviewText": "Super duper flimsy it a sense the parts that come off can easily be snapped back on so therefore your child can\u2019t \u201cbreak it\u201d but the from compartment comes off you need to install your own batteries it does make some cool noises and sounds that was the best part . I figured a 2 foot truck at least with little 7-9 inch toys inside by looking at the photos . You have to watch the video to see how it really looks you have to apply the stickers and the signs . The back piece falls off easy as well . I mean i was going to spend 55 in store on something similar to the pictures. But it was 32.00 here but after tax like 37.88 and it came fast too . It\u2019s not a bad toy it\u2019s just way way way smaller than what it looks like in the ad they completely cheat by putting a child and father next to the toy and photoshopped it to make it look largerThe little cars inside the Transporter are hot wheels size like 3 inches . Perfect for other hit wheels to go in btw . But if you want a sturdy toy this is not it . I had fun with my little one though putting it back together over and over and over \u2026 said \u201cuh oh\u201d for the first time \u2026 anyhow \u2026.",

                "reviewText": "I bought two of these construction truck big rigs and a fire truck big rig for my grandsons for Christmas. I knew when I picked up the box from the front door that it was not going to be good. All three of these sets were inside the box and it did not wiegh more than a couple pounds. Upon opening each box for inspection it became more evident that the quality was super cheap and that these toys would not last more than a day before ending up in the trash. So as disappointed as I was I decided to test my theory with my 4 year old and twin 3 year old grandsons. First preparation is peaking the super thin decal stickers off and sticking them to the trucks without them tearing into pieces, four of the stickers tore when removing from their respective sheets and the rest I managed to be very careful with. Next putting the 2 AA batteries in place above the cab of each truck, two trucks when well the third one end up with a broken tab so the siren would no longer stay in its place. Now lastly I started sticking stickers to the street signs and out of the 3 sets I ended up with 2 broken signs. Also I want to mention that these big rig trucks and the smaller tractors and trucks that are placed inside their respective trailers are far smaller than they appear in images by about 3x less in size respective to the adcertising pictures however to this sellers credit the measurements in the description are closer but I still feel over eggerated. Lastly they boys played with the toys for a couple of hours off and on over the course of the day and approximately 1/3 of the three sets ended up broken and in the trash.Rather than go through all the hassle of returning the items I felt that providing an honest review (unlike those I read before purchasing) would be a more fitting punishment to the seller for misleading me, swindling me out of my money (near $100 for the three sets) and for selling trashy products. DO YOUSELF A FAVOR AND FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS IS NOT IT!! By the way the one star was given just so I could leave a review otherwise I would have at the very least given a -5.",

The 3 year old did seem to enjoy it and played with it. I still stand by the review that it was expensive for what we received and the advertisement was very misleading. Granted, shame on me for not reading dimensions and other reviews. But my attached pictures shows the real size next to my hand. No, I'm not a giant. I have normal sized hands.",

                "reviewText": "Our 2 &1/2 year old loves this train! We bought the attachable carriage to complete the overall look and give the option of a second rider for him. The train engine this attaches too is easy for him to operate and doesn\u2019t go too fast as to scare him. Assembly overall wasn\u2019t too challenging but did take some time. The amount of track that it comes with is enough to keep him entertained and is fairly good sized (takes up the entire center of our living room). The battery life of the train engine is fantastic and we have not yet seen the battery die even after several hours of play. The storage area under the seat is a neat place for kiddos to take toys along for the ride. The only issue I have with this product is that the passenger carriage has different buttons that play different things, along with some train sounds there are also creepy nursery rhymes that will play. The nursery rhymes tell some incredibly strange stories that I feel aren\u2019t appropriate for small kids. One of the stories talks about a bird that a little girl calls \u201cstupid bird\u201d because it won\u2019t say what she wants it to say. There are other creepy ones but overall, these stories don\u2019t leave you with warm fuzzy feelings. Thankfully, our child doesn\u2019t care to listen to the stories and just plays the train sounds. I will also say that this product is rated for ages 3+ but my husband and I feel that our child would be too big, or just about too big, for it by that age. Overall, good product. Four stars instead of five because of the creepy nursery rhymes.",
