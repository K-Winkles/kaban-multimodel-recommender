                "reviewText": "In my pictures the pink car is from this replacement pack. The red car is what came with our car ramp.We had the car ramp for just a few days and the grandkids most definetly needed another set of cars. This car ramp keeps them busy for quite some time so it is worth it to me to have LOTS of little cars for it.This set of replacement cars are just a bit smaller all around and a bit lighter than the ones that came with the car ramp. That doesnt matter to me in the least as the cars are not racing each other side by side. If they were racing side by side at a slight incline, then the heavier car would always win.We just wanted a basket of cars to be able to race and not have to stop and collect them all every 45 seconds. Our grandkids have created tunnels for these to go through once they exit the car ramp. This gives all of us great enjoyment and is a multi generational time that we can all enjoy together.The plastic cars feel sturdy and the wheels so far have been able to withstand a 2 year old and a 5 year old play time. I would purchase these again.",
