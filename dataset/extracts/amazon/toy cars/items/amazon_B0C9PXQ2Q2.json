And while the car works and runs how it\u2019s supposed to, the transform feature does not. The button for the transforming just isn\u2019t working, which is sad because he wanted a transformer and not just a remote control car. If you\u2019re getting this as a gift I would definitely test it out first to make sure all the features are working.",
