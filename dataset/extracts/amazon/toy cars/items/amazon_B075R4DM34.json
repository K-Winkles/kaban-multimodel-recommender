These mini toy cars, inspired by the beloved Disney Pixar Cars movie, are the perfect size for little hands. The pack includes a variety of characters, which my son loves to identify and race across the floor. The level of detail on each car is impressive for their size, capturing the essence of each character perfectly. They are well-constructed and durable, able to withstand the enthusiastic play of young children. These micro racers have sparked my son's imagination, leading to hours of creative play. They're also conveniently sized for on-the-go entertainment, easily fitting into a small bag. This toy set is an excellent addition to any Cars fan's collection, offering great play value. A definite five-star rating for the joy and excitement they bring to my little guy.",

He\u2019s been collecting the regular sized diecast cars, so he was excited to match them up (Mommy & Baby cars, he called them!). They\u2019re made well but the paint chips with normal play. He likes to take them outside or in the bath tub\u2026. Unfortunately the paint has started cracking and chipping from hitting rocks and pavement. No water damage though! He also likes to take them in the mud and give them mud car washes.They\u2019re still adorable! We find the mystery mini racers at Fred Meyer on sale for about $1.99, so that\u2019s in line with the price of this set. Great deal! You could get a set like this and break it up for rewards systems (Potty Training, Sleep Training, etc), or gift them individually in goodie bags, Easter baskets, or stockings.Hope this helps! \ud83d\ude09",
