I think the variety of colors and textures is very important. Especially for young developing minds. The toy seems safe and sturdy, however I do feel some of the pieces loosened a little easily but not to the point where they would come off. It definitely does its job in terms of keeping my son busy. It seems to secure well to the car seat. Overall build quality is probably a 4 out of 5. I would recommend this at its price point.

These toys have exceeded my expectations! Not only are they adorable and colorful, but they also provide great stimulation for the baby's developing senses. The soft textures and gentle rattling sounds keep the little one engaged and content, making car rides much more enjoyable for everyone involved.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Good toy overall",
                "reviewText": "I ordered this and another (dif designs) one for a boy and one for a girl. They are good quality and bright clear colors. It gets the babies interest. It's very soft. It does what it's supposed to wrapping on the cars seat handle but it's loose and doesn't stretch all the way across. It will work as a toy they can carry around when a little bigger but as far as for newborns and using on the cars seat it's OK. It would be better if it had a way to secure it better. There are straps you can tie but not really long enough unless you want to tie a knot in it. In order to not have it pulled off and fall on the floor and cause you to have to constantly fetch it in the car, I would suggest trying to find a way to attach it somehow with those little shower curtain style rings that are sold for hanging baby toys. But the product itself is very nice and captures their attention. The designs are on all sides so it doesnt matter how it swings. It could be used on the car seat, crib, or just about anywhere, and it seems safe enough to be carried and chewed on by any age baby or Toddler. Even though stretching across would give you more options to posistion it, the payoff is that you can scoot it out of your way while grabbing the handle. Even with the \"attaching\" issue, I find this a quality toy and so do the babies, I would highly recommend this. I hope this info has been helpful.",

My nephew is too little to grab at it yet, but he loves looking at it and it keeps him mentally occupied while traveling. I look forward to when he can play with it even more, but he already shows great interest in it and I have very happy with it.",

It will work well as a car seat toy, a shopping cart toy, or even a handheld toy. But directly out of the package, the toy smells unclean--musty and fishy. I'll need to wash it by hand, according to the instructions, and let it air dry before it's safe to let our little one handle it.",
