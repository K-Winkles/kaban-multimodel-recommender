The things dangle down & it\u2019s pretty much in her eye on sitting on her forehead. I\u2019ve tried to see what I can do to fix it ; but idk if it\u2019s my car seat or what. But it\u2019s cute & stuff but it\u2019s too much of being in the way. I could\u2019ve returned it but it\u2019s too much of a process. Then the strings to tie it , won\u2019t stay in play so it\u2019s constantly being bunched up . It\u2019s pretty difficult if you ask me.",
