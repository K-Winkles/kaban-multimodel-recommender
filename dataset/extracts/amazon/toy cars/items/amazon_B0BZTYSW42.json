But he likes watching me play with them when I push the head down the car takes off. Which makes him excited. I'm sure once he gets a little older these will become very entertaining for him. The toys are good quality and don't seem to pose any risks for young babies.",

                "reviewText": "These cars are lightweight but seem fairly sturdy. Unfortunately I received two duplicate cars - two of the black police car and no blue car. The printing is fairly clear, though the names and abbreviations printed on them will be a little unclear for most American kids. Most importantly, they roll nicely when just pushed, or you can push the head down with a bit of force to make them propel themselves - fun! They really do go fast and FAR, both on carpet and hard floors. Despite what the product details say, they don't go when pulled back, just when the head is pushed down.The mat does have a bit of an odor when first brought out of the box. It's quite thin, but a nice way to store the cars together. It has velcro on the sides to make it into a little tote bag, but no Velcro across the top to actually seal the cars in. You can use the cars on the mat for imaginative play, but they go a lot farther than it is long when pushed! It has buildings to match to the themes of each vehicle, but again, the abbreviations (FB for fire brigade, RP for the police, EP for sanitation?, etc.) won\u2019t be meaningful to American kids.Overall, a fun toy just for the cars themselves - kids will have a blast with them!",
