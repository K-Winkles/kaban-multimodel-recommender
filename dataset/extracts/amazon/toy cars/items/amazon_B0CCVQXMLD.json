I came across this one, and the reviews looked promising. Boy am I glad I trusted me instincts and went with this one. It was a huge hit! This R/C can go front and back, side to side, and in circles. It's quick and even blows \"smoke.\" It lights up and plays music, too. The music is really my only complaint. It's very loud and there isn't any volume control. At first it's not bothersome, but after listening to it for long periods and can become too much. Otherwise, it's a great toy!",

The remote control offered the usual R/C actions and even has smoke emission which my son found to be very cool. The only thing is I think with its type of material and how it's made - it's definitely just made for indoor play. I don't think this can survive grass or any uneven terrain. So far, we haven't encountered any problems with it. If you're looking for a toy gift then we recommend this one.",

Plus, it sprays smoke out of its mouth when it roars. It's easy to control, an its movements are swift and smooth. It can move sideways, diagonal, and of course, forwards and backwards. This is not the kind of RC car that can jump off of a ramp, but it does plenty of awesome moves that even a regular stunt car couldn't do. This dino car is seriously impressive. I think every child should have an RC car like this, and that is not a statement I make lightly. Lol. This is one of the best RC cars I have ever seen.",

                "reviewText": "My nephew (and my dogs) just love this Dino truck!! It came partially charged so we were able to get it going right away. Plus the fact that it charges via USB makes it really convenient to recharge when needed. Much easier than finding a screwdriver to change a battery. It\u2019s fast, it smokes and plays some crazy sounds - that being the downfall for us adults! The Dino roars are consistent even when stopped. This is great for limited time periods of play.",

                "reviewText": "We have a little stunt car that zips around and is lots of fun. This is more like a showboat with earworm techno music. The kids love them both, and the cat is beside himself. My toddler goes to bed and wakes up asking for the Dino car. From pre-k to 4th grade this car has been quite a hit!Although the kids love it, I\u2019d be hesitant to gift it since the parents might not love it. The techno music is good fun, but 10 minutes of anything on repeat becomes grating. The Dino continues to roar even when it isn\u2019t being driven. Anyone with a child knows that the level of background noise can become a bit much. We may end up relegating this to the playroom, but for now the kids are having great fun, and the cat is learning the limits of what he can hunt.",

I just wish that there was a volume control on the noise as kids love to constantly play these types of sounds. This is a recommended buy.",
