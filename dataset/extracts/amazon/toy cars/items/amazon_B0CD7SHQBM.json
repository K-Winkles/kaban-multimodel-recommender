When I saw these soft pull back cars for toddlers, I thought they would be perfect for my grandchild. Grandma wants to play too. These cars are soft with rubber wheels and are a perfect fit for small hands. The mat for the cars has handles and velcro sides and can be converted from a mat to a carrying bag for the cars for storage or traveling. It is considered an educational toy, as it helps with motor control, and is a visual tool as the cars zoom on the mat. This is a toy for 12 months +. Of course, a 12 month old may need some help.",
