I would say that the roads itself are easy to take apart and put back together for kids around the age of five however, little ones are able to use it once the roads are clipped. It\u2019s so nice to have the cars that can go by themselves however, one of our cars did not spin its tires due to a defect on the inside of the car. However, I was able to take the toy apart and make shift away to get the motor to run correctly. My son is obsessed with this!",

                "reviewText": "My kids LOVE this set and it's a ton of fun but does have a few small setbacks which are just sort of annoying but not a major inconvenience. Firstly, both my boys got one of these for Christmas and if you are going to get this I highly recommend you buy 2. The amount of tracks as well as bridges you get is decent but when you have double it is perfect for some kids who like to change the track up or build bridges and things. It is super easy to put together and tear apart and easy for children to do as well. Set backs: the spin wheel it comes with has a place for 2 AA batteries however the batteries are slightly small so it doesn't work. I have tried new batteries and changing positions just in case I was doing something wrong but to no avail, however it works fine without batteries and I am unsure what the batteries were supposed to be for. The battery is the cars need changed daily, I am going to start taking them out at night, the kids are not leaving them on all night but when we get up in the morning the cars are all dead so I think the car is using the batteries up even when they aren't on which is annoying but again not a deal breaker for how good the toy is! My only other complain which honestly may be my own fault (we have 2 rough and tough boys so it very well may be us) one of the 4 cars broke within two days of playing with this toy but the other 3 work fine and it's not worth packing everything up and sending it back just for that.Overall I highly recommend this toy yes it has some set backs but the benefits of this great useable, fun, engaging toy far outweighs the cost of some of the small annoyances!",
