Solves my problem of car toys getting taken into the house and then there's no toys in the car the next time we go in it. I just keep this in there all the time so there's always at least 3 toys in the car and there's always at least 3 things she can reach at all times while I drive. We have one in each vehicle now.",

                "reviewText": "This is useless if your baby is rear-facing, which they should be if they are at an age when a toy of this type would interest them. We have a mid-size sedan and the Nuna Pipa car seat (rear-facing, as our baby is 3 months old) and the fit of the toy was an abject disaster. Not only was it completely incompatible with the baby mirror (we had to choose between the two, either the toy or the mirror), but the placement was so low that the bar and hanging toys just lay on baby\u2019s lap. We removed it after having one good laugh about the poor design and we will be returning this. A shame because it\u2019s cute and seems to be well made.",
