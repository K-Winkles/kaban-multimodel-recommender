I have it at the highest setting in the photo since my girl will look at things but not touch them yet. It doesn\u2019t make noise if the baby isn\u2019t hitting it so you don\u2019t have to worry about it being too distracting to the driver. We bought this after my girl consistently got bored and fussy in the car. Seems to help so far.",
