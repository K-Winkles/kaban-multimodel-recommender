                "reviewText": "This was purchased for my grandsons birthday and I was surprised at how small it was but it is very well made and my grandson, who turned two, loves it. The cars are a bit small so if you have a toddler that likes to put things in their mouths, you may want to think twice. It has held up well and is used often. Keeps him entertained for hours. The small size does make it great to store or for travel.",
