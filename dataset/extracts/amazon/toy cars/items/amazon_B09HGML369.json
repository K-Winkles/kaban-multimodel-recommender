                "reviewText": "This toy car/transformer is for our four year old. The buttons are simple, forward/back and turn. One button makes the \u201ctransformer\u201d stand up and the car is still drivable. Only issue is the transform button is a continuous motion so you have to guess where to stop it, sort of like wiper blades on your car if you just turn off the ignition while they are in motion. My kid loves to show off the moves and drive it around our hard floors, not as successful on carpet. We only have the one so no comment on the 2.4Ghz interference. Rechargeable batteries for the car with a USB cord and 2 AA for the remote. Received 1/10/2024.",
