                "reviewText": "They come in a box that says they are officially affiliated with the Disney Pixar movie \"Cars\". It was easy to open the box and slide the plastic holder out, revealing all of the cars. The cars popped out of the plastic holder, and would pop back in to place if you wanted to store them in the box. Once the cars are all out of the container, it is very difficult to know which way is up and which cars go where, so here is a pointer. Tow-Mater is larger, so look for the largest opening and press Tow Mater into that spot with the hood of his truck toward your right hand. Look at the colorful box insert to show which cars to press into their spots around Tow Mater and work your way out with all car hoods pointing to the right. Our problem wasn't getting the cars to fit back in the plastic holder, it was my grandson, who didn't want us to put his cars back so they could go home. We had to agree to let him hold Tow Mater and Lightening McQueen in the car. These roll well, do not make noise when played with, look like they are a little too big to fit on a Hot Wheels track. My 3 year old grandson loved them.",

                "reviewText": "This Disney Cars set was perfect for my 4yr old son. He's obsessed with Lightening McQueen and has watched the movie on repeat for the last 5 months, so this toy car set was a perfect addition to his addiction. The cars are metal and very sturdy. Very impressed with he quality. They are similar in size to Hot Wheels cars, but heavier and slightly wider. Packaging was also fantastic, comes in a movie memorabilia-style box, with a spot for each car. We've saved the box since it's quite nice for storing the cars afterwards.We also purchased the Mack truck hauler separately, so my son loves loading the truck with all the cars and driving them around. Would highly recommend this 10 car set!",
