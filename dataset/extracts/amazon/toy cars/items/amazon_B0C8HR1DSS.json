                "reviewText": "This little RC car is packed with some cool features that make it incredibly entertaining. First off, it comes with built-in LED lights that not only add to its aesthetics but also make it look even cooler, especially in the dark. But what sets this RC car apart is its unique control system. Instead of using a traditional remote control, you wear a control module on your hand. To make the car move forward or backward, you simply tilt your hand up or down. Turning left or right is as easy as rotating your hand in the desired direction.This gesture-based control is not only intuitive but also incredibly fun to use. It's perfect for kids who are learning hand-eye coordination as they play. The car responds promptly to your movements, making it feel like an extension of your hand.But what really impressed me is its performance. This RC car is not just for show; it can do some seriously cool stunts. It can drift, spin, and even climb down stairs with ease. I've even tried dropping it from a few feet higher, and it handled the impact surprisingly well.Overall, the Aiqi RC gesture sensing stunt car has been a hit for my kids. It's not only entertaining but also a great way for kids to develop their coordination skills. Plus, watching it perform its stunts is simply exhilarating.",

There was no option to contact the seller, so I did an exchange.Second car I received had all parts, but the gesture controller doesn't work.I'm not replacing a 2nd time - too much hassle.That being said, the main controller does work - though a bit clunky.The car itself is great and is tons of fun. My son loved it. Pretty much everything is as advertised. It goes almost any terrain, even grass if not too tall. and can move in any direction. Fun to play and try to do tricks.Even has this cool little steam function to make it look like smoke coming out of the tail pipe.Would have been great if the gesture controller worked.",
