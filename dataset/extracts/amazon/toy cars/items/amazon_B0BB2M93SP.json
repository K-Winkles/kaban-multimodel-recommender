                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t know what I was thinking, but my baby can\u2019t even reach this toy in either his car seat and stroller. The bar is usually too high for him to even come close to reaching it. He loves playing with it when I lay in on the floor or wrap it around the side of his play mat.",
