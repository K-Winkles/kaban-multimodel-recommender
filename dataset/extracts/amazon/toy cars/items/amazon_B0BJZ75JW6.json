Upon purchasing this hanging rattle I was happy of it's versatility to easily connect to either to my bassinet or even switch up its usage on the car seat! Both my baby and I like the overall aesthetic of the toy and the functionality (crinkly sounds squeaker, rattles, and bells) it provides for entertainment and baby development of grip, coordination, and motor functions. It is very soft overall. I would definitely purchase again as it'd make a great gift for expecting mothers.",
