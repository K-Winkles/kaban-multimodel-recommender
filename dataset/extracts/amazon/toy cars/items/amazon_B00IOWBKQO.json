It takes a bit to put together, and getting the right alignment is tricky. Overall, it's relatively decent. I do wish it had been manufactured in the USA though. My niece and nephew do like playing with it, so I suppose it fulfilled its purpose.",

                "reviewText": "There are several points I\u2019m going to make about why this is getting returned but I\u2019ll start with the one that renders it impossible to use.I\u2019m very adept at putting things together and following instructions. While it appears from some reviews that theirs came with the rubber mallet that the instructions say is critical; ours did NOT come with that. Luckily I have just about every kind of tool including my own set of socket wrenches which I hoped would resolve the fact that the little metal tool they included did NOTHING to tighten the bolt on the steering wheel.Despite having better tools for the job, the bolt wouldn\u2019t tighten at all and no matter what we do the handle comes right off every time. I\u2019m not putting my 3 year old grandchild on this. When my kids were young we had the REAL plasma car which they loved and have all talked about it being a favorite from childhood. Will be returning this and getting a plasmacar.Lots of reviews indicated the handle comes off and unfortunately I didn\u2019t see those until I came back looking for any solution to get this thing put together. They also indicate problems with the wheels (we wouldn\u2019t know as we did not get to that point of use). Some even indicate that the wheels that come with it don\u2019t work but that they got the \u201cupgraded wheels\u201d and installed them and they\u2019re great. I personally don\u2019t feel like buying upgraded wheels should be necessary for it to work right. Also, people who got two at the same time mention one being able to be put together and the other they could not.But I am curious why some people seem to be able to get the handle to attach while others don\u2019t. To me that indicates that there is not uniformity in these products and you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get\u2026 so don\u2019t bother.",
