He plays with it so much that the spoiler eventually broke off but he actually wanted to happen, once it broke he snapped it off completely himself! He thinks it looks cooler that way. Mater is his second favorite and also the one my little sister (2+) uses so he\u2019s missing a few things. His rear view mirrors were rubber and eventually broke and we snapped off and the hook in his trunk as well, plastic and broke off. But he plays with his cars ALL DAY. EVERY SINGLE DAY. He never puts them down until he goes to bed. He\u2019s been playing with them for months now so I\u2019d say they are VERY durable considering it\u2019s a 2 year old playing with these everyday and the car itself is still alive. The cars are all metal with hard plastic tires and some like mater, have rubber parts but all is good!!!!",
