The \"rev up\" mechanism inside each of these four cars and trucks makes it easy for babies and toddlers to get big acceleration with just a little input: Pull back one of the soft vehicles--then release to see it zoom off across the floor! The action of grasping and pulling back is great for fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination; the activity of \"driving\" and collecting (pull, release, crawl) benefits large muscle groups and coordination, too. Get even more \"miles per gallon\" with a variety of colors, shapes and sizes, illustrated characters, and everyday themes to inspire conversations, cognitive connections, and imaginative play! These soft fabric vehicles are bound to be popular at playtime, but with four exciting vehicles there are enough to share. And parents and caregivers will be grateful for the removable wipe-clean wheelie insert and washable fabric surface! Melissa & Doug K's Kids toys nurture early childhood development in three key skill areas: physical, cognitive, and social. With interactive designs and multisensory features, K's Kids promotes constructive play and effortless learning, keeping interest high and new skills flourishing throughout the baby and toddler years! The Melissa & Doug Pull-Back Vehicles make a great gift for kids ages 9 months and up. Our toy cars are fun to play with and provide an exceptional screen-free play option for babies and toddlers.

They can be thrown around and they won\u2019t get damaged or do damage to the wood floors. I liked them so much I purchased a second set for my niece.",
