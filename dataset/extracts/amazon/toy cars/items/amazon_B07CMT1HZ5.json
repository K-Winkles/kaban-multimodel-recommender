Only weak point is the flexible plastic front axle that may be popped out causing car to do donuts instead of go straight which was actually pretty fun anyway. Its very easy to pop back into place and I think the flexibility helps the car move straight as well. I really like these cars. Would definitely buy again.P.s.Cats like to chase.",
