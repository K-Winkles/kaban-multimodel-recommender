                "reviewText": "My 2-year-old grandson really enjoyed these cars and had a great time watching them fly off the table onto the floor. My puppy managed to get a hold of one and before I could get it away from him, he was able to bend the front set of tires. The car still worked but would only go in circles, which my grandson thought was hilarious and kept asking me to \"do it again\". The set has a great variety of vehicle types and colors and the pull back on all of them worked well. Many also had additional \"realistic\" moving parts. They are just plastic so very lightweight and very small (slightly smaller than a matchbox car), but we played with these for a couple of hours almost non-stop. I can't rate for durability as I'm not too sure about that. For me, they were worth the cost for hearing my grandson's belly laugh, but they are just inexpensive plastic and likely will not last long, so I'm not sure I would purchase again or give as a gift.",

There are lots of different kinds- from first responders to construction vehicles and even different languages on the cars. Only one arrived broken, and I'm sure it would be easy to fix with a small screw driver. They are pull-back style cars and drive forward if you just pull them backwards a little bit. They're easy enough for the kindergarteners to make work. It came with quite a lot for the value and will last us through the year I'm sure along with a few packages of other toys. Overall would recommend!",
