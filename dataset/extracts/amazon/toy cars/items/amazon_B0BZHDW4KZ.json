                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This RC car was definitely worth the price, and I was excited to buy it for my little brother for Christmas. It is a handsome, fast little car and is great for my little brother to learn how to drive an RC. I was disappointed in the fact that the material was not very durable. Small pieces chipped off during its first use, decreasing the awesome Bugatti look. All things considered, it was a product worthy of people's money.",
