                "reviewText": "Works exactly as advertised. After all the other toys he received, my nephew kept coming back to this one. Car was easy to transform..drove on hardwood and carpet. It states for ages 8 and up but at 4 he was able to operate it with ease. Please note that it did take 5 yes 5 AA batteries to operate (2 for the remote and 3 for the car). I opened ahead of time to install the batteries so it would work upon opening and getting the packaging back was a chore but worth it. Very pleased.",

His 8 year old brother likes it too but doesn\u2019t get many turns with it. It needs to be on a hard flat surface, but once you have those conditions it spins, speeds forward/backward, and transforms with ease.",
