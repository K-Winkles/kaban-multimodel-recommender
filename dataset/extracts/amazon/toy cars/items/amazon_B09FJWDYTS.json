                "reviewText": "Other than one defect, we love this product, but it\u2019s an important one. The screw that is supposed to hold the cover on the battery compartment does not have anything to secure it in place. The hole the screw is supposed to go into is just a plain hole with no threads, which means the battery cover comes off with little to no effort. This is unsafe for a baby/toddler to play with, especially in the back seat (possibly out of view and reach of an adult) as intended. We put some heavy duty packing tape over the compartment as a quick fix.If this was fixed, the product would be 5/5 stars, easily. My son LOVES it and it is a lifesaver on long car rides.",

Keeping it because our kiddo showed some interest in it in the car. I would also say until your kiddo can sit up on their own/has good hand eye coordination, this isn\u2019t the toy for them.",
