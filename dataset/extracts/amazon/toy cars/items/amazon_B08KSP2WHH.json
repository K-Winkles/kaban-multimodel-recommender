                "reviewText": "I bought this toy for my 15-month old daughter. It's mostly great, she loves it. It's cute, sturdy and easy to operate. There are only two buttons. The first makes the car move forward in a straight line. The second moves the car backward and turns the car. There's no other steering. It zips around on our laminate floors and plush rugs.This toy requires a total of five AA batteries (None are included.) Two go in the remote control and three go in the car. The battery life seems reasonable. The range to control the car is about 10 feet. Nothing too crazy, but plenty for a little one.This toy is a little noisy. It has an engine sound and a siren that play when buttons are pushed on the car. It also has a little song that plays when the driver's seat is pushed down, which happens frequently when the car crashes. It kind of sounds like Tetris music with a Cha Cha. It gets a little annoying after a while (especially when my husband starts whistling it- but that's not your problem). You can mostly make the song go away by removing \"Mr Police Officer\" from the car.The sound can not really be controlled. There are no volume buttons and no setting to make the car respond to the remote control without the noises also being available. The sounds can not be activated by the steering wheel.Our car seems to be... possessed. Well maybe not, but it does randomly move when the power is on to the car. It just kind of jumps a few inches. It's a little unnerving at first, but I can't say it's the only possessed baby toy in the house. Maybe it's the house.",

                "reviewText": "This product is nice and fun. My toddler loves it very much. It is easy to remote control the airplane since it only has two buttons. One button to go forward and one to go backwards. Fairly easy for a toddler to handle. Product says is good for 18 months and older. My son is 19 months and it's easy for him to use. Overall the quality for the toy is fair for the price. The only reason I gave it a 3 star is because it can be a little dangerous. WARNING for kids that have long hair parents please supervise child at all times. My son has long hair that is right above his shoulders. One day he picked up the toy to place it at the other side of the room and pressed the button. While holding the airplane toy, his hair got caught with the tire as the tire was spinning. The second time his hair was caught it was by the propeller. Everytime his hair was caught it wasn't easy to untangle his hair. I had to grab some scissors to cut his hair off. I decided to write this review for parents that have their toddlers with long hair. Child may be to young to understand not to put car anywhere near his ear. Either to listen to noise the product makes or just to simply carry it from one place to another. I tools the product away from my son and will wait until he understands that the product must not go anywhere near his hair.",
