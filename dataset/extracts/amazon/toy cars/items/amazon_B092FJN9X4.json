He was all smiles from the minute we took it out of the box! The car has weight and substance to it. It\u2019s not cheap or easily breakable plastic. I like that it came with batteries. The clear body allows you to see the gears moving and the lights are wonderful! The music is loud and can\u2019t be turned down or turned off but it\u2019s a catchy tune so it wasn\u2019t a problem. The car doesn\u2019t move very fast but I love that it backs itself up or changes direction on its own when it encounters a wall or other obstacles. Well worth the price!",

                "reviewText": "I brought this to work with my speech patients and they all thought it was cool. I like the way it can drive around the table and most of the time it reverses before it falls off. The little multi colored gears are fascinating . Drawback: the music, while fun initially, gets really grating listening to it all day and there\u2019s no way to turn it down. It was too loud for a few of my sound-sensitive patients, and me too after listening to it for an hour or so. Overall : good value for the money. Oh and I brought it home for my dogs to see it. It scared my Pittie and my two Shih Tzus kept barking at it. My GSD Border Collie mix thought it was fun though!",

I didn't realize it played music when I bought it, and the music is pretty loud. In fact, I can hear the music playing in my head now and I haven't been near the car for two days. The only movement I saw was on carpet or the couch so I don't know how well it moves. It doesn't move very well on cloth surfaces but that's expected of any car. I only wish I had caught it in a flash sale (I saw one for $13-14) instead of paying $20-25. The lower price would have made up for the extra star. I can't speak to durability as my nephews have only had the toy since Christmas.",
