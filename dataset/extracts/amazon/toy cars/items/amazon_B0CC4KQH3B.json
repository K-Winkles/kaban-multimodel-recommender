It's his first one he's ever used and the two buttons make it easy for your child to learn how to make the car go forward and backward. The music is a little repetitive though, it would have been nice to have something other than one song. But overall it's an inexpensive toy so for the amount of joy it's given him, it's worth it.",

I like that it comes off because you can surface clean it that way. The little face is adorable and the lights make it fun at night too. It needs a lot of batteries but it's worth it. Recommend",
