By simply twisting your wrist or moving your arm, you can effortlessly control the car's movements. Why does my watch not match and the red light keeps flashing? Before connecting the watch signal, we need to turn off the car and the remote control and disconnect the two. Please use only one control method at a time for optimal performance. Why doesn't my watch work when connected?

                "reviewText": "My nephew is a typical boy. He loves cars but lives to play rough with them if flipped over ran in circles the only thing was the hand revomte controls were not easy to use at first it tookA while to have the dexterity to be able to use it. He loved it but just in case I did purchase a warranty just in case it did not work but he played with it the whole time after dinner could not get it away from him I recommend this for your young nephew or neice it will give him some fun and quality time with friends and family.",
