                "reviewText": "So as you may have seen from other reviews, this item is not as big as the picture suggests. That being said, my 3 year old grand son loves it and it is quite durable. Its also very cute. Is it worth 30 dollars? Hmmm..no, that is a little high in my opinion, but everything is over priced now a days. The big question is how long will it entertain a toddler? Well my grandson messed with it the first day for a while, but then moved on to something else once he disassembled the crate on the back and took every dinosaur and scattered all over the living room. LOL. However the next time he was over, he found out he could push it and race up and down my living room with it, and that entertained him quite a bit, wasn't pleasant for us though as it was super loud. He's enjoying it thus far, so all in all Im happy, he's happy.",

Sure I could have read the dimensions and other reviews, but who always has time to do that?This toy is of average quality and is much smaller than pictured. It is definitely overpriced at $39.99 which it was early December (ripoff). As of 12/27/23 it is $23.99 which is much more reasonable. If you can get it for that price, it\u2019s not such a bad deal.",
