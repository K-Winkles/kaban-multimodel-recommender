                "reviewText": "My kids love their transparent gear train, so I thought that I'd get them these. First thing I do when I receive a new toy is check for sharp edges. These came set of 2, both cars have little sharp pieces that stick out and are dangerous for little fingers. There were a few spots where I needed to smooth out with a nail file. The stickers that go on the cars are next to impossible to remove without tearing to pieces, which essentially renders them useless, but I'd gladly take stubborn stickers over the obnoxiously loud music. There is no way to turn the music down. I ended up putting layers of tape on the speaker vent which made it slightly more tolerable. Gear was also misnumbered 1-2-3-5(?!). Otherwise, the kiddos love the visual stimulation, the noise and bump and go design.",
