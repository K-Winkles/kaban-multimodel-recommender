                "reviewText": "I bought this one and another model for my two grandsons who are 9 and 10 years old. I charged the batteries and ran them myself to see how they performed before wrapping them up and was impressed with the overall quality and performance. The boys opened them excitedly and had them running and flipping over and running upside down, spinning around, and doing tricks I could hardly imagine. They love them and I would recommend them to anyone.",

                "reviewText": "The tires are made of a hard, cheap rubber that does not provide very good traction indoors (works ok on carpet, but just does burn outs on hardwood/linoleum). Has that cheap, Chinese plastic smell to it. Also, the remote does not recognize pressure sensitivity on the joysticks, they simply work as on/off switches for the wheels. Couple this with the poor traction, and you really can\u2019t control the thing with any degree of precision. It\u2019s just best for making lots of donuts or for thrashing around.However, with all those things said, my kids love this toy. The construction is of a pretty good quality so it is durable, and seems that it will survive at least a few weeks of abuse. The battery also lasts a good long while\u2026 not sure how many charges we\u2019ll get out of it, but I doubt that it\u2019s novelty will last long enough for that to be an issue.All in all, I would say this is a good toy for little kids, age 3 to 7 or something like that. Once they get older they\u2019ll probably want something more sophisticated. I would probably buy it again just because it is so affordable.",

They really like making it spin, and spin, and spin. The lights are cool and it seems to be pretty durable. I can't say how this will stand the test of time but for now, it's a hit. Nice size and flashy.",
