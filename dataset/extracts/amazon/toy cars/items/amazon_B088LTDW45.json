I giocattoli sono robusti, hanno colori sgargianti e dettagli sensoriali, mentre gli imballaggi sono riciclabili al 100%.Le macchine sono pi\u00f9 grandi di quanto immaginassi e tutte molto graziose! Sono in legno, mentre le ruote sono in plastica rigida.Alcune (quelle a forma arrotondata) riescono anche ad entrare nell'ascensore del garage Hape e tutte vanno abbastanza bene (le ruote sono leggermente pi\u00f9 strette) per la bisarca Melissa & Doug.Avrei preferito che fossero interamente dipinte, ma anche cos\u00ec le ricomprerei senz'altro!",
