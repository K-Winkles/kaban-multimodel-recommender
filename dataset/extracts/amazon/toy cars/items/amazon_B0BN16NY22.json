Hmmm\u2026I\u2019m getting a new dog, maybe I\u2019ll name it piston. But I digress..The boys love these cars. One even sleeps with his. Now they don\u2019t do anything special except the eyes move when the wheels do. They are made of the same hard plastic that all toys are. And while the boys have every car in the Disney set, this is the beloved one. Maybe because it\u2019s bigger? After I saw how much they liked it I bought the larger Tomater truck, but poor Mater didn\u2019t get nearly the same love. They\u2019ve had them a month and have dragged them back and forth from their house to mine and seems to be out when I go over, so I\u2019d say they are sturdy with good play value.Hmmm\u2026is Mater a good name for a dog? Is Lightening too obvious?Anyway, if you have family kids who are into Cars and they don\u2019t have this size car, I recommend.",
