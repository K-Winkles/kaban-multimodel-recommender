On the other hand, it operates as advertised, remote control easy to handle, simple design. It does not talk or emits any sounds which leaves a little wish for however runs, gyrates, converts to and from car-robot flawlessly. Good buy after all for the price. BTW, it came fast and in good condition.",

I bought 3 for 3 kids ages 4, 6, and 8 and all 3 have been over the moon with them. They're easy to set up and use and while a tad flimsy the kids haven't broken them yet and that's a big deal. Generally speaking, they're really neat and at a sale price totally worth it. I've already sent the link to several people.",
