This was a gift for my grandson. Unfortunately, this item was not shipped in a brown box. As you would have guessed, shipping label right on the retail box. I had to gift bag the cars and be creative to make it exciting for him to see what was in the bag.",

Absolutely no duplicates, which is really wonderful. Considering both are made by Mattel, why don't the Hot Wheels 50 and 60 packs be duplicate free also. Has a mixed ranged of old school cars from the 40s - 70s etc and modern cars 2000s and beyond.",
