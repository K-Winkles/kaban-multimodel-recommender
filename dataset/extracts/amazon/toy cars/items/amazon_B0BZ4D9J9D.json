When it arrived, the cars were significantly smaller (about the size of her hand), and the mat is so small that she can\u2019t sit on it while playing with the cars (only a few roads on each side). Definitely a disappointment. I\u2019m also concerned that the packaging notes this is for 3+, even though the description indicates it would be safer for younger children. Had I read the reviews before I purchased I would have seen similar comments. Next time I\u2019ll remember to read reviews before purchasing.",

Unfortunately they are tiny. A small child can almost hide the entire car in his hand The cars and the road may are nothing like what is advertised. Don't buy this garbage.",

                "reviewText": "Hopefully you are reading this before purchasing! The set is a lot smaller than the product photo shows. It is very misleading just based of the pictures shown. Definitely not worth what I paid which was $33 but it\u2019s literally 3 days before Christmas so it\u2019s got to go under this tree lol but seriously cars are smaller than palm size, play mat is small and they feel to be on the flimsy side. If I paid like $15 for this I wouldn\u2019t care but definitely not worth $33. I could have went to five below or Ross and paid less for something better.",
