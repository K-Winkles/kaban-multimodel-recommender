Morandi color does not refer to a certain fixed color, but a color relationship. Shades named after a series of still lifes by Italian artist Giorgio Morandi. It is based on a set of color rules summed up in Morandi's paintings. Why the car seat toys is in Morandi color? We updated car seat toys for the following reasons: 1. This color won't use bright and dark colors to cause a visual impact on newborn babies. On the contrary, It increase visual development for babies through reducing the purity of the colors.2. This color could create a comfortable atmosphere that is enough to make baby feel at ease. It will pacify our newborn babies. How to Clean it?

There are times when I am in the car with my baby for a long time, and this toy bar keeps her preoccupied and busy, without being overly stimulating. The colors are a nice muted palette. My baby loves tugging away at the various soft dangling toys, and the little mirror is adorable. As much as she has tugged and pulled at the hanging toys, they have surprisingly remained good as new with no rips or tears. I have also brought this into the grocery store with me many times and wrapped it around the cart handle, so if you're looking for a great way to keep your baby entertained while staying away from screen-time, this toy bar is the perfect solution.",
