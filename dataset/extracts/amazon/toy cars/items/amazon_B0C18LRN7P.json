                "reviewText": "Ein ausgesprochen sch\u00f6nes Set, das sogar mich als Frau begeistert (und unseren Sohn ja sowieso).Die Autos wirken sehr wertig und zeigen sich im Alltag selbst nach l\u00e4ngerer Zeit - auch des Herumgeworfen-Werdens durch einen Ein- und Dreij\u00e4hrigen - \u00e4u\u00dferst robust. Zudem sind sie durch ihr rundliches Design nicht nur kindgerecht und sicherer geformt, sondern wirken dadurch auch irgendwie niedlich. Mein pers\u00f6nlicher Favorit ist das pinkfarbene Auto mit der britischen Flagge auf dem Dach, das ist schon au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnlich originell und - wie aber auch die anderen - alles andere als langweilig.Von der L\u00e4nge her entsprechen sie \"normalen\" Autos anderer Hersteller, wie z. B. von Hotwheels oder auch die kleinen von Siku, sind aber deutlich breiter und massiver.Auch die mitgelieferte Spieldecke wird von unserem Dreij\u00e4hrigen oft und gern benutzt. Sehr praktisch ist, dass sie dank Klettverschl\u00fcssen sogar als stabile Transporttasche f\u00fcr noch viel mehr Autos dienen kann.Wir empfehlen das Set auf jeden Fall sehr gern weiter!",
