They are more durable than they look (the clear plastic faked me out on that). The colors are truly random -- out of 50, about half were red or purple while there were only 2-3 of some other colors -- but that is fine for my purposes. These would be great as party favors and they are small enough to fit into medium-sized plastic Easter eggs for Easter egg hunts. I'm going to be adding them to Operation Christmas Child shoebox gifts as an extra little fun filler item. I'm sure the kids will enjoy playing with them - I did! :-)",
