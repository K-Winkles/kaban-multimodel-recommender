As soon as my son was playing with it , it fell apart because you CANNOT SECURE THE PIECES TOGETHER. Do not buy. Waste of money and time. Totally frustrating and disappointing.",

                "reviewText": "The instructions were difficult to understand, mainly because it was in black and white, making it harder to see. Would recommend adding light coloring to the instruction manuals in the future. However my main concern was the assembly and disassembly. The parts of the toy that connects to the other parts to form different track sets were very difficult for me to take apart from one another. I nearly broke the connector parts because they were so stubborn to come off each other. My son enjoyed the toy at first but I presume he quickly got frustrated with it himself because of how long it would take me to transform it into another track orientation ,without trying to break the toy, to the connectors. I would highly recommend as a fantastic toy for kids my sons age, but due to the unclear instruction manual and the tough assembly and disassembly I will be referring to alternatives when recommending similar products.",

                "reviewText": "Build quality: Acceptable. It's your run of the mill plastic, better than dollar store quality but not absolute top-tier quality plastic. The plastic does have some flex to it, but nothing concerning during use. The car works well, scanning the codes and making the appropriate sound effects. No serious concerns regarding build quality.Use: So putting this together is relatively straightforward. Everything snaps into place with one-way latches. The main body (consisting of the two blue scaffolds and the red/green endpieces) pretty much stays as one unit throughout the different setups, and it's just sliding the ramps into place in different positions. The ramps are surprisingly not interchangable; there are specific spots they go to, so I recommend putting it together once and then putting the stickers so it matches the box/instructions so it's easier to figure it out later. My one gripe is that with the zig-zag setup, the ramps have this weird protrusion at the end that is only on one side, which makes the car do weird flips as it goes down, and sometimes ends up upside down. Fortunately the remaining setups don't seem to have any problems, with my kid's personal favorite setup being the giant ramp.Overall, it's a nice toy, and the fact you can use different setups and that it comes with a fancy light-and-sound car makes it a good, albeit not excellent, value.",
