                "reviewText": "My husband picked out 2 for his grandkids whom live out of state. The red one here didn't even turn on. My stepson said he's going to keep it because both of his boys are under 3 years old and like playing with it even though it's defective. I had a return set up for him but he decided to keep a broken toy so that the youngest who is only 1.5 wouldn't throw a fit I guess. The blue one works fine. For that I'll give a 3 star. Kind of bummed. I know they're inexpensive but, you'd at least like them to work.",
