It's a nice size so that it doesn't take up much space in our very small apartment, but she loves racing the cars down the ramp over and over again. I would definitely recommend this toy for any kiddo who likes cars.",

I have included a picture of an apple for scale in my photos so you can get a good feeling for size.We have one just like it from another brand but this one is so much better for one main reason - On this toy the car elevator is controlled by a bar that gets pulled and pushed down (the bright greenish yellowish bar in my pictures which is best seen from the side view). This bar is perfect for little hands and can be easily manuevered but still works on fine motor skills. The other brand one uses a rotating crank with the tiniest handle and it's impossible for littles to do on their own which just frustrates them. So this B. Toys version is frustration-free!There is a little sound/musical element to this on the interior of the lowest level. I probably could have done without this part, but it only makes a short noise when you drive the car over it which brings my toddler a lot of joy!Pros:+ Car elevator bar lift+ Bright colors+ Love the characters - they are common across B. Toys so it's fun to see them included+ Minimal cardboard for sustainability purposes+ Size - not a humongous car track, easy to store away+ Car wash details are cute!Cons:+ Musical button feature can't be turned off",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this for my 15 month old because he's been getting more into his little play cars and he absolutely loves it! The cars are the perfect size for him and the overall track is not too big so it's easy to use and sits on our coffee table just fine. He has figured out how to push the button to make the noise and every 4th noise is different so he has learned to push it multiple times to get the sound he likes. Definitely a great purchase for him because in addition to the button with the noise it has little levers that he has to figure out to get the cars in/out of the ramp correctly. 10/10 recommend.An additional note: The label from the company says 18months+ so let me preface my review by stating that I have a very large toddler, he's 3 ft tall and weighs in the 33lb range so when I say my 15 month old, he's the size of a 3 year old so please keep that in mind if your child is smaller this review may not be as accurate for your child yet.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, the set is great! Allows both little kids and slightly older toddlers to both play with it. Durable and the structure itself has held up. The cars are both sturdy as well! Only complaint about durability, is the flaps for the car wash. More realistic with the material they used, but also will likely break off.The cars, gates and elevator work okay. The elevator doesn\u2019t glide well up to the top. When it goes up, the elevator tends to stick on the 2nd floor and before you keep going, the car rushes out. It makes it challenging for kids to get the car to the top floor, unless they are rushing the elevator to the top. At the top, there is an arm that holds the car back, before it races down. Our arm from going up and down so much, has chipped away the plastic where it rests in the down position.Overall great option for value and cost. Only real gripe is the elevator is difficult to get to the 3rd floor",

There is the outline of a \"gas station\" on the back but no actual gas pump for them to pretend to fill the car or anything My kids are loving it though. The elevator is smooth going up and down. It's a little hard to get out a car if it flips over in there but it's doable with a little effort. There are fun sounds and whirly spinners for car wash etc. when the cars go through. the car goes nicely down the track, occasionally stops halfway but keeps going with a nudge. It is high quality I don't feel like it's going to fall apart while my kids are playing with it or anything. I love that it came with 2 cars. It has been keeping my 3 year old kids entertained more than any other toy recently!",

I initially thought this gift would be great for the 2-3 year old range, but the other night, my six-year old grandson came to visit, and he spent almost the entire visit playing with this toy on the kitchen table. I thought the sound was a little off and was going to replace the batteries, but the screw to the door seems to be stripped. I'll have to find the right tool to remove it, but he said it was just fine the way it was. He even got more toys from the cabinet to enhance his play. Wish I still had the little helicopter for the chopper pad on top of the elevator...at least that's what we decided it was! Great toy for the littles...and doesn't take up much space at all!",

                "reviewText": "My 3 year old son loves playing with this toy set. From the cars to the elevator to the garage, it keeps him busy. The elevator works -- kids load it up with a car, and then manually brings it up/down. The garage has a sound feature that makes several engine sounds -- this is powered by (2) AA batteries. Everything seems to be relatively durable -- its been able to survive my son dropping it to the ground repeatedly. Overall, this is a nice toy. Rated for ages 18+, it is still suitable for my 3 yr old son. I would recommend it.",
