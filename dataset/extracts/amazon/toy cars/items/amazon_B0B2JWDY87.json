                "reviewText": "I bought this as part of a birthday gift for my 9 year old daughter, who loves science. At the beginning her dad helped her with the hovercraft. She doesn\u2019t want to wait for the next project. She used the motor to create a few more projects by herself. I\u2019m happy when she shows me her independent projects. Her favorite one is using the little motor to draw on the round cards. Wish they come with more cards. But I cut more for her so she can invite friends to try. At the beginning when you first open the kit, it smells like chemical for a few minutes. So I took everything in the garage. Other than that, it\u2019s really a smart and simple kit that Elementory kids can do it themselves.",

                "reviewText": "Terrible! Doesn\u2019t work! First issue was the instructions just have pictures and don\u2019t truly label the pieces - not a huge deal, they\u2019re all simple enough projects.First we tried the balloon boat. The pieces were slightly different than the pieces in the pictures but we figured it out - the directions talk about angling the straw to change the direction of the boat - but the hole in the boat is straight up and down, our straw could not be angled no matter how much we tried, and our boat went nowhere!Then we tried the motorized boat. Small issue, the cutouts are slightly different than pictured, as is the design of the motor. Now the big issue - We got it all assembled and my daughter was having a hard time attaching the propeller straw to the motor. I figured it just needed to be shoved on there tight, so I tried and tried and no matter what, it falls off. I tried electrical tape, it falls off. Looking through the instructions, this setup (the straw + motor) is used in most of the projects! So these components not fitting together is a huge deal. I hot glued them and it looks like it might hold for a little while under very gentle pressure, but really this is ridiculous. Waste of money, disappointed kids, and discouraged mom. Don\u2019t waste your time and money on this poorly designed kit.",

I thoroughly enjoyed doing activities along with my child. They have lot n lots of youtube videos that explain how you can make projects and very easy to follow.
