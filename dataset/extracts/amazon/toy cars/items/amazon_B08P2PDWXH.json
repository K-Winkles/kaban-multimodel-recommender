Cool idea and pretty fun LITTLE unit.I deducted two stars for a couple of reasons. 1st the picture shown is incredibly misleading. This is worse than the pictures in your local fast food joint showing succulent delicious tall fluffy burgers, only to find a flat soggy mess in the box when you open it. The description does indicate the size so I recommend reviewing the specifications before purchase. Buyer beware so I'm going to eat the cost since I didn't read through that part or the comments.I also removed stars because since the size is not accurately represented, the cars are much smaller than expected. I believe they will eventually find their way under the couch, in the laundry, under a tv stand, possibly sucked up in a vacuum. Also the item seems to be a little more flimsy than I had anticipated. I'm hoping it doesn't get broken but time will tell.Overall it's a fun LITTLE toy. I just feel that the company should pull that main picture that shows the large toy and represent the product accurately. Seems a little shady.",

All of the picture show this as a large floor toy for toddlers and its about the size of my husband's hand spread out. Beyond tired of fake Asian companies scamming on here and Amazon letting them. Is there no quality control or oversight at all? Multi billion dollar company can't afford to run a program and look through reviews? I want my money back. This was a toy for my babies birthday and I can not give this to him. It's cheap and tiny and crap. About done w Amazon and this nonsense. DO BETTER",

                "reviewText": "I have a 3 and a 5 year old. My 5 year old is non-verbal autistic. Both of my kids love this toy, and will play with it for a long time. Setup is easy. I like how it includes several different cars. The mechanisms seem to work consistently, and my kids were able to figure them out on their own. I think the variety holds their attention and demonstrates different forms of lift and motion, like a problem solving puzzle. Also, the toy is affordable, considering how complex it is.Cons: The plastic parts have skinny fittings and pegs that can snap. They are repairable with glue. However, they can only take so much abuse before they're irreparable. The materials they use are not the most durable, but they are also what makes this toy affordable, so it's a tradeoff.Overall, this is a good buy.",

                "reviewText": "This was a present for my 4YO and she enjoys it. It is very small but it seems to work for her tiny hands. It took a while for her to figure out the various handles and buttons but that\u2019s part of it. Its definetly good for fine motor skill practice and critical thinking and it does NOT require batteries or has any sounds (total win as a parent). The cars are super tiny and very cheaply made and I think too light for the game as they easily rotate or flip over - this frustrates my daughter a lot. Because it is made of cheap plastic, it will be interesting to see how long it will last in her hands. We got this on sale and I would NOT pay more than $15 for this product in this version due to size and quality. There may be bigger and better versions out there so look out.",
