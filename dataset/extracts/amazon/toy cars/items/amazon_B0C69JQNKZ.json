                "reviewText": "Wow this toy has given us so much entertainment, my 2 and 5 year old both love it. There are easy options for younger kids (levers and buttons) and some steps are great for older kids (twisting and turning knobs). Its a bit smaller than I pictured but I'm amazed for the reasonable price and complexity that it works great! Note that for the car jump to the helicopter you have to hit the button with the right amount of force, it works well once you figure it out. Only thing I'd change is I wish it fit back in the box after being assembled or that it had a compartment to store the tiny cars so they dont get lost but still definitely 5 stars!",
