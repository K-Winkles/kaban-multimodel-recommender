                "reviewText": "My baby took to this right away! My baby is 3 months old and loves to go on walks in her uppababy vista. She is also really enjoying reaching for toys and tugging on them so I looked at many toys like this for her bumper bar. I picked this for a few reasons. 1) the toys aren't too long, which works great on the vista bumper bar. The toys would be unreachable if I put them on her carseat handle, so I don't recommend this toy for that use. 2) there are a variety of toys. So far my baby likes grabbing the rings the most, but I anticipate she will like the mirror and other toys quite a bit as well. 3) the price was on the lower end of the range I saw these toys sold for. One minor complaint is that the toy is very scrunched up. To get the toys spread out I had to use two rings from other toys to wedge the ends of this toy in. That kept the toy stretched out so that my little one could easily see each toy distinctly and play with them individually. Hopefully with time the toys stretches out more. All in all, I am super happy and definitely recommend this toy.",

                "reviewText": "We ordered this item because my son hates being in his car seat and we were looking for something, anything that could possibly help make it more tolerable for him. After looking through several different car seat toy options and reading through reviews we ultimately decided this item was best. Reviews mentioned that it stays too tightly coiled but this is not an issue for us as we weren\u2019t looking to have it permanently attached to the car seat handle any way. Our intentions were never to use it while driving, but rather as a distraction when we are shopping, running errands, or going for walks... how tightly or loosely it coil has no effect on its purpose to distract our baby. As soon as we received the item we took it out and inspected it. It was in mint condition. We washed it in a net bag in the washing machine and let it air dry attached to the car seat handle (we did not coil it around the handle but rather stretched it out so only the ends of the toy were wrapped around the widest point of the handle\u2014this loosened the coil and it isn\u2019t so tightly wound anymore, it worked perfectly). This toy is exactly what we were looking for!",
