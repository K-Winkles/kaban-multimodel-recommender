                "reviewText": "I never post reviews. Unless something is just spectacularly exceptional, which this thing is. First of all, I LOVE this brand - we already have a lot of \u2018B. Toys\u2019 from the past several years with my older daughter, so I knew immediately I would not be disappointed. I know baby play gyms aren\u2019t a monumental purchase that parents research for hours and days (and weeks) like other larger baby items, but when you\u2019ve already bought a crap load of baby ..stuff, spending like $50 or even $100 for some brands is just excruciating. Even if it\u2019s just on principle. All of the baby play gyms like this I\u2019ve seen are not only stupidly expensive for what it is you\u2019re actually buying, but they are pretty ugly. No need to mince words here. Another thing you don\u2019t need as a parent of a new baby is something that takes more brain power to assemble than getting a bottle ready or changing a diaper, let alone having to cipher through a bunch of complicated diagrams and instructions and hardware when you\u2019re already sleep deprived and frazzled af. And let\u2019s be real most people probably already have enough garish, brightly colored baby stuff all over the house. So, in light of the aforementioned criteria, you can bet that this baby gym checks all the boxes. The price is a steal for the level of quality and what all it includes (especially if you are using the 15% registry discount), aesthetically it is super cute, neutral and well designed, it is light as a feather , and extremely fast/easy to assemble (the time it took me to assemble was maybe 5 minutes, which included going to the living room to get the box and walking back to the baby\u2019s room, opening the box and getting all the pieces out. Actual assembly could probably be done in less than a minute by someone who has had more than two hours of sleep. I was extremely impressed and tickled with the toys that came with it- they are not only removable so you can take them off and use them with your car seat or stroller, they are developmentally spot on and soft, AND one of them doubles as a teether! Like, a nice one that you would pay at least $15 for by itself. Which is nice since babies won\u2019t really need to use a baby gym like this for a terribly long time - it is great to be able to continue using the attachments so it doesn\u2019t feel like a giant waste of money for a very temporarily usable baby thing. So there you have it, all the reasons why you should totally get this if you are in the market for a baby gym, hands down!",

                "reviewText": "When I picked out this baby gym, I had been comparing many that were in the $60-80 range. This one is a wonderful price for what you get in comparison. The pad seems soft and washes easily, and the toys are cute and good quality. I\u2019ve put the two fabric ones (mirror and star) in the washing machine in a mesh bag and the silicone one in the dishwasher, and they all came out great. My favorite thing about this baby gym is that I can change out the toys- pretty much any toy that calls itself a \u201cstroller toy\u201d or has a loop compatible with linking rings (we use the Sassy and Itsy Ritzy brands of rings) can go on it. The only trouble is that the wood of the dowel is pretty soft. I added a couple small gouges the first time I tried switching toys. If you\u2019re careful to open your rings super wide, you can avoid this, or, the end caps that hold the legs to the dowel are fairly easy to unscrew so you could thread toys on from one end. The whole thing was very simple to put together as well.",
