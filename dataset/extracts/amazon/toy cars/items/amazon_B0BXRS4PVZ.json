I've yet to try to attach a toy that won't work with these. Soft ones, chewie ones, hard ones... they all work well. Plus the texture is great and she can chew on them. I throw them in the sanitizer every now and then to keep them clean. They're also not that sticky texture that attracts hair and fuzz, which I hate. I see us using these as my daughter gets older for snacks/drinks in the car, as well. Definitely recommend!!",
