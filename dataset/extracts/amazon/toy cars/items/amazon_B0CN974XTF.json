                "reviewText": "When you see the product images for these trucks you might think some look small because they're more distant in the image. But that's not really the case! There are a variety of sizes, ranging from roughly matchbox to quite a bit larger.The look of these this set is pretty nice. You get a good variety of work trucks, and so far all the little boys I've known have loved playing with toy farm and construction equipment. The downside to the realistic look is you have some fairly sharp and pointy bits. But these are three and up, so it should be okay. If your little one is putting toys in their mouth, this won't be a good fit.The plastic used for these feels very lightweight. I guess I'd say these are probably here for a good time, not for a long time, but I've been surprised before by how long seemingly flimsy plastic toys last, so who knows. They just don't feel like some of the higher-quality plastic toys I've used for my kids in the past, from companies known for using recycled materials in making their toys. The little airplane has a \"pull back and go\" feature, which was nice.I do really like the little playmat, which has Velcro on the sides so it can be both playmat and carrying bag. Pretty neat, and useful for taking toys on the go. And I really like how realistic some of the trucks are, too.Overall, this set of trucks is okay. There is a lot of variety, and there is a lot of fun to be had with toys that don't need batteries. But, for roughly $20 (asking price at the time of this review), I don't think this is a very good value, and I'd have a hard time recommending it.",

                "reviewText": "A bunch of plastic trucks with movable parts that are a blast to play with. Great farm vehicles and a quad to tow on any of the smaller trucks. There is a metal pull back Police plane that comes on the trailer for the big front loader. There are 11 vehicles and two trailers in this set. The plastic blades on the farm vehicles do not move when they are pushed around. Not an issue for kid play. They are all different scale sizes, again not an issue for kid play. I really like the weight and feel of these trucks. They all fit rather lumpy in the carry bag which opens to a small oval street with 3 parking spots on each side. Funny the \u201cP\u201d in 3 spots is in the correct position, on the other side the \u201cP\u201d is backwards or seen a lower case b from the cross view. Silly but a gain no detriment to the playability of these trucks. Lots of moving parts to lift and scoop. I rate it an A",
