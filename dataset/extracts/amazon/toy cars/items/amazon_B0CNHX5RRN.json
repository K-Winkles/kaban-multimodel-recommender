The cars are not the highest quality but are nice enough to play with on the track mat.My son liked playing with the trucks when we initially got them but they are not his favorite and he lost interest quickly. It is a cute gift that includes trucks and a mat track but not the best gift for kids expecting higher quality toys.",
