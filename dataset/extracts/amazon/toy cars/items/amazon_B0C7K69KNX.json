So, you will need to give the car a slight push to get it started. This might be a tough concept for the younger ones. Some babies will be good just to put the cars on the track. It will just depend on the age. It's definitely fun for them to watch the cars get to the bottom of the track, and do it over and over again. This has been a favorite toy for one of my grandsons.",
