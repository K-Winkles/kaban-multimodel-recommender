                "reviewText": "I want to start by saying this car is not meant by any means for a full blown R/C enthusiast. It\u2019s for small kids to get some fun out of it and then maybe graduate up to a better one that offers more features on a leveled up vehicle. This is a very basic car. It has great suspension but it\u2019s not really needed because the motor, torque and overall weight of this car don\u2019t get to put it to any real use. The car is like an old Prius, needs a long time and space to speed up. It\u2019s turning radius also leave a lot to be desired, but like I said, this is very entry level fun only. I laughed when I read some other reviews, I mean what do you think you were getting at this price point? A high tech, fast, very maneuverable car? This is a toy, not a pro racer. I like it and I hope those who order it understand what they are getting before jumping on the criticism.",

Which is sad bc I got so he could drive it in the snow and mud which it advertises, but it definitely can not. The turning radius is terrible, even if you get it for indoor use.... good luck. Its 3+ point turns no matter what. Looks great, good quality material for crashing. But definitely not worth it for other RCs for can get for $20.",

It comes with 2 rechargeable batteries which automatically increases the fun factor of the car. The batteries recharge via the included USB charger. I also like the remote control with how the front wheels are controlled with a steering wheel instead of a joy stick setup. The 2 required batteries for the remote are not included with the purchase but that's a small price to pay for the fun you'll have. Overall I would definitely recommend the product for a birthday or Christmas gift for anyone from child to adult.",
