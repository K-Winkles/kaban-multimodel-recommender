If sand is loaded too far in the back of the dump the sand falls out. So, I corrected this by adding a piece of adhesive cork between the dump and the frame. Easy fix. Now the dump can adjust to any position automatically. It is more fun and interactive. The manufacturer could easily change the plastic design to end this problem in the future. It is a nice looking fun toy, especially when combined with the front loader tractor.",
