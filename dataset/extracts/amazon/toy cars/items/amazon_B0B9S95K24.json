                "reviewText": "The picture is definitely not what it seems. I thought these never came. I took a picture of it with a soda next to it, so everyone has an idea of how big they actually are. If Christmas wasn't right around the corner, I'd send it back. These people are completely scamming people out of money, which is terrible especially around holiday season.Update : It's a lot smaller, so small that I just gave it to my child now. The little cars are wind up toys, so they'll drive for actually pretty good distances on their own after being wound up. The transporter car lights up and makes noise with batteries. So it did end up getting better. 1 star to 3 stars.",

                "reviewText": "I was very excited to purchase this toy for my grandson who LOVES trucks. The photo shows a young child playing with the truck and it looks like a LARGE truck for an approximately 18 - 24 month old boy. When I received the package it was literally the size of a saltine cracker box. The truck was extremely smaller than the photo portrayed. I payed $30.00 for this toy which is way to much to pay for a small toy. If it was actually the size they make it seem it would be a good value but it is falsely advertised. I am very disappointed and am likely going to return it as it overpriced for the size. The actual size toy is worth about $15.00 in my opinion. You can see in MY photo that the toy is less then 14\u201d long. And it is only 5-1/2\u201d tall. It is about the size of a box of instant oatmeal. Sooo misleading of this company. Sooo disappointing.",
