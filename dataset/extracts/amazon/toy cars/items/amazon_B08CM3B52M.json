I wasn't expecting much, I figured he'd break it pretty soon because he's hard on toys. But, it still survives. It has really cool lights on it and a siren (I think). It is not real obvious, in the directions, but you have to read through them, that you need to change the batteries when you get it for it to automatically move forward. Then the lights and the wheels turn. The lights will work if you just use the batteries that come with it but change them and both work. I think I paid less than $20 for this....for Valentine's Day and he was thrilled with it and still plays with it and took it to school for Show and Tell. And his sister was upset that I bought her a doll instead of something like this! So worth it. I liked it so much that I bought the fire engine too....for his birthday.",

                "reviewText": "We purchased this truck for my five year old as a birthday present. He absolutely loves it. He loves that it looks totally different from the traditional looking police car that we used to have. The lights and sirens worked great for a while and make it a very exciting toy to play with. However, they do not work as well as they did when we first got it. Friends that have come to our house have also loved playing with it as well. It is definitely and great gift for any kid who love cars, trucks and police vehicles! It was also a very affordable price compared to many others that I looked at.",
