It would be perfect if the battery for the remote is also rechargeable. Thebattery in the car last just enough for our time in the pool. The battery in the car can be easily recharge. Teenagers actually enjoy this toy well just like my seven year old daughter",

                "reviewText": "This is a very cute, very great quality car! The battery life is wonderful, so much longer than the battery life in your typical RC cars, it charges pretty quickly as well. The remotes connect to it wonderfully and they are both easy to control and get the RC car to do as you want it to as well. It does float in our pool and once you get it started it works incredibly well, it goes forward, backward, and all directions. It works great on land too whether it is in grass or on a smooth surfaced floor or driveway/carport. Packaged very neatly and has very clear instructions as well. Great quality all around. The controller for the water is not as waterproof as you would like, water did get in it and caused a slight problem with it as far as working as it should.",
