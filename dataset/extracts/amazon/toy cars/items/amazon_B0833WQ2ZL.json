The little helicopter and cars that come inside the plane are really cheap plastic. The helicopter lasted maybe a day before the rotors broke off. The main part of the airplane is holding up surprisingly well given how tough on toys my 3 young kids can be. It's a nice size too in that it's decently big without being too huge for a smaller kid to maneuver around on the floor.",

F\u00fcr den derzeitigen Preis w\u00fcrde ich es aber kaum empfehlen.Die dabei gelieferten Autos sind sch\u00f6n und fahren geschmeidig. Die Turbinen des Flugzeuges fallen schnell ab m\u00fcsste man wahrscheinlich festkleben.",
