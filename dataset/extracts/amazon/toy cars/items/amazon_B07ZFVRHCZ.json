Our Grandson was 18 months when we got them and months later they still look brand new. They are the perfect size for his hands, no sharp edges and are so sturdy and well made. The colors are vibrant and help with learning. I love that they are of different styles and types of vehicles. The insides are very detailed, as in, seats, steering wheel, gear shifter, etc. They roll well on all surfaces. He just loves them! I feel these are not just for toddlers but that older kids would love them too. I know our grandson will be playing with them for years to come. You do get 6 of them which is wonderful. I would whole heartedly recommend these to any one who is looking for good quality and safe toy for your toddler, kids, grandkids or as a gift.",
