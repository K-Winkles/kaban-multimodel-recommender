HOwever, sometimes when carrying the carseat it just gets in the way and sometimes gets kinda undone and comes down in baby's face. I often take it off because it's in the way, and use the toy just to hold baby and shake it in front of her face instead.",

We use the car seat in the stroller. Thus this toy is there for both the car and the stroller. Our baby is particularly attracted to the donut ring with the balls inside.Pros:- good quality- unique wrap around design which keeps this toy securely fastened to the handle of the car seat- colourful- baby is attracted to the hanging pieces and can reach up and touch them- Not noisy so when driving they are not distractingCons:- noneOverall I can highly recommend this.",
