After reading many reviews, and looking at different toy car play sets, I went with this one. I think it\u2019s perfect for my little guy. The vehicle sizes are actually bigger than what I thought they would be. Product quality is great! The stoplight that flashes red or green, it takes two AAA batteries not included, is a fun bonus that came with it. I tried to take pictures of the play mat so you could see its actual size. It is very small! I tried playing with my grandson and putting all the vehicles on the play mat and it\u2019s just not big enough to play with all the cars on it. I love that it turns into a tote for all the vehicles, but that\u2019s about all it\u2019s good for. The vehicles have to be on a hard floor in order for them to go on their own. I think my grandson likes it. We just received it today so time will tell.",

The cars are the perfect size for little hands, and the mat is so cute and durable! So nice for a travel toy, the sides velcro together and the cars go inside. Nice little handles to carry! Great quality! Wonderful purchase!",
