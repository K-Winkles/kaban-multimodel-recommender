        "description": "1989 GRUMMAN Long Life Vehicle Die Cast 5 Inch United States Postal Service Truck The Grumman LLV was specifically designed for the United States Postal Service; Grumman won the contract to produce it. The main design points of the vehicle in contract competition were serviceability, handling in confined areas, and overall economical operation. As its name suggests, the Grumman LLV is easily capable of a long life, perhaps approaching 20 years of operation. The lifespan specified by the U.S. Postal Service was 24 years, but in 2009 this was extended to 30 years. The majority of LLVs have been on the road for over 27 years. The body and final assembly is by Grumman, and the chassis (based on the 1982 Chevrolet S-10 Blazer) is made by General Motors, with the powerplant (2.5L I-4 TBI \"Iron Duke\" and, in later production, General Motors 2.2L I-4 iron block/aluminum head engine), instrument cluster and front suspension similar to those used in the Chevrolet S-10 pickup and S-10 Blazer sport utility vehicle.",

It is a wind up car with internal cranks when you pull the car backwards. The back loading door does roll up so you can put things in the mail truck. That door is very fragile though, so it can easily be broken. There\u2019s nothing small that I would worry about a kid choking on. It\u2019s a very cute truck for the money so I do recommend it.",
