                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t know if these toys are actually used in Montessori nurseries/daycares, or used Montessori theory in their product development and design (Montessori is not a trademark, but an educational method developed by Maria Montessori in Italy over 100 years ago) but it doesn\u2019t matter as these are fantastic.For something that realistically will only be useful for 6 months or so, the quality is superb - silicone and plastic. Easy to clean. The pull strings and other movable parts move easily. I myself enjoyed playing around with it before washing it thoroughly to hand over to our granddaughter who\u2019s staying for the evening.So far she loves it - at four months old she doesn\u2019t quite get what to do with it (yet) but it keeps her busy and that is a win right there.I can\u2019t stress enough how great it is that you get two of these. Babies are fickle and can latch onto a favourite toy quite quickly. If one of these winds up getting dirty, falls on the floor and the dog runs away with it, whatever \u2014 we have a back up on the ready to swap out whilst we clean the other.Highly recommend, cannot find a single fault with this and I\u2019m a tough critic.",

                "reviewText": "For individuals experiencing difficulties in sensory processing, the Sensor toy is truly worthwhile. Special education teacher, my student saw the benefits of this approach. The sensor toy is one such toy that effectively integrates all these senses, thus proving extremely useful for the therapeutic exercise of sensory integration. Customization is available for it, and hence you allow your children to play with the kind of setting they like. This toy comes with inbuilt sounds that make their game interesting and help regulate sensory systems such as sensory input or sensory calmness and soothing experience experienced might need. I have noted that kids get more engrossed with concentrating on self-regulating their sensory stimuli through the use of this toy. The material has also been amazing in our classroom sensory corner.Despite frequent usage and handling, the toy\u2019s durability is admirable. This is quite important, especially in an educational setting since the materials used are child-friendly and can easily be cleaned.The Sensor Toy is an excellent resource for sensory therapy and educational environments. It is necessary for kids with sensory challenges because of its durable build and flexibility.",
