                "reviewText": "These cars are made of recyclable material (No.5 plastic), which I believe is curb recyclable. No metal pieces are used to build the cars. While these cars don't have a very smooth finish like B toys' other toys, they are very sturdy!The plastic used to make the cars is hard plastic. I tried to push the roof of the blue car because I was worried that our 2-year-old might crush it. Surprisingly, the plastic is much sturdier than it looks. As I applied more force, it still did not bend (see the picture I uploaded, my finger tip is turning white because I am pushing it hardly...), so I am not worried about its sturdiness.Pros:1.Larger than I thought2.Sturdier than I expected3.Great value (about $1.2 per car)4.Environmentally friendly plastic (not made with mixed materials such as metal + plastic, etc.)Cons:Not very shiny and doesn't look very fancy.I have to say these little cars are better than I thought, and they are a great value. I am giving it 4.5/5.0 starts, rounds up to 5 star.",
