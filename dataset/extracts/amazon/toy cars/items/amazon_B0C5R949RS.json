We decided to get some fun, but small, lightweight toys to pack into our boxes. These are going to be so great for the preschoolers!There are twelve different designs\u2014including cars, trucks, choppers, earth-moving machines, etc. The three construction vehicles, two fire trucks and two helicopters all have moving parts. All of these vehicles have cute faces and are self-propelled when you pull them back and let them go.If you are giving this set to a single child, the way it is packaged is very appealing and makes it quite gift-able. There\u2019s a play mat that looks like city streets. When you fold it up and fasten it with Velcro on the sides, it forms a cloth carrying bag, which is really neat.While I think this is a cool set, I do think it\u2019s overpriced (at almost $ at the time of this review). All of the toys are plastic, so I am not sure how long they will survive with preschoolers.",

                "reviewText": "I was a little disappointed when they were delivered since they are fairly small, and my son isn't quite old enough for them yet. But! I absolutely love these little things! They have pieces on them that move, unlike a lot of cheap toys we got as hand-me-downs, and I even had fun messing around with them. The mat is fine, I haven't had a chance to use it much, but it is a little small. If your little one loves cars, you can't go wrong with these!",
