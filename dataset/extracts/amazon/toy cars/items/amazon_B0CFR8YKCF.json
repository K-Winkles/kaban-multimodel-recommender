                "reviewText": "I wanted to get my toddler something to keep him entertained while riding in the car, while refraining from watching videos on a tablet or phone. I found this cute little back seat toy and thankfully it does the job at keeping him engaged and not sitting in a boring back seat. He loves jungle animals so we figured it was perfect to do the jungle themed one. The stuffed animals are a nice size, are soft and some of them even rattle. The toy is easy to install (just some clips around the headrest and voila)! It's easy for him to reach from his carseat as well, and it comes with a clip on baby safe mirror. The only complaint I've got is that the piano part doesn't actually have different keys that baby can stomp around and play, but rather one large button that plays music when stepped on. I was disappointed, as I thought he would be able to make his own tunes on the foot piano, but it's not a deal breaker, since it still does its job and keeps him entertained for most of the rides we take!",
