They are smaller than most of the toy cars we own but the impressive detailing and the sturdiness of these Pixar Cars make these the most coveted toys in my house. We had bought this for my 4 year old but my 8 year old and my 11 year old boys are always fighting over these. They have already been through thick and thin with my overactive boys...they have been in the bathtub...they have fallen into our staircases, walked on... even thrown on walls and they still look brand new (the cars, not my walls though). My 3 younger sons have so much fun playing with these cars and I couldn't be happier with this purchase.If my review was helpful let me know by clicking on the ''Helpful'' button :) \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
