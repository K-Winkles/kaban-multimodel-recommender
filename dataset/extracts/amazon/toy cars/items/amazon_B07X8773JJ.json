                "reviewText": "Ok, so it is smaller than it appears in the videos, but I\u2019m ok with that. Reading the reviews myself I was most worried about the turning radius, which I was pleasantly surprised by. It\u2019s good enough to maneuver through the house pretty well. The lights blink at something like a 1-2 second interval, just on off on off, not flashy like lightning like I expected. It\u2019s pretty fast, we have to hit the trigger and let off, hit it again, etc to drive in the house, there\u2019s only one speed. Go. lol. I don\u2019t know about battery life yet, we just played with it when it got here out of the box without charging and it only lasted about 10 min. It probably was t fully charged, but we\u2019re charging one now getting ready to go again! It\u2019s fun to play with, the top cover is pretty flimsy, but overall it feels like a solid build. I\u2019d give it 4.5 stars if I could, assuming I\u2019ll get at least 20 minutes per battery. Seems like remote control cars I had as a kid lasted a lot longer. I don\u2019t know, but battery life doesn\u2019t get much better until you\u2019re paying around $100. Took a picture for size reference.",

Good for a beginners to learn to control a Rc before you get a really top doller Rc car.Great product for your kids",
