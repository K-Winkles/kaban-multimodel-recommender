I worried a bit about the center of the cars maybe leaking the watery-glittery fluids that are inside the middle of the cars, but we have had them for over a week and no signs what-so-ever of possible leakage. These cars are pretty well made, and not with cheap materials either. We adore them in our house!",

                "reviewText": "I really, really wanted to love these... They are adorable and even my 7 yr old was fascinated with them. Both of my girls took them over to the window and spent a good chunk of time playing with them in the light of the window. The frames seem sturdy and and the wheels roll smoothly. My negatives are that the green car is leaking... it doesn't appear to be actively leaking, like I am not seeing dripping, but there are wet green stains near the edges so however the liquid is sealed it is damaged. Not sure if it was damaged in shipping (although it was packaged well) or is defective. I really worry how these would hold up to toddler throwing and smashing. The other concern that I have is that on one of the cars the curved top portion is rough- not so much that I worry about splinters but I did take some fine grit sandpaper and smooth it out a little more before letting my kids play with it.",

                "reviewText": "I have two little great-grandsons, 1 and 3. I wanted to add to my toybox for their visits, saw these great wooden cars, and they are now the new favorite when the little guys visit. The wood is very durable and the perfect size for little hands. The colors are bright and attractive, and they are very low tech, designed to be pushed around--with all kinds of motor sounds coming from both of them. The baby can have a lot of fun with these, and the older guy is learning to put his imagination to good use. They were a bit hit! I am delighted with their design and function, and would recommend them without hesitation to anyone with small children. They would make a fabulous gift for any occasion, and will last forever. They clean up easily, which is a big requirement in my mind--those little guys can get sticky hands in the blink of an eye! These are just great!",
