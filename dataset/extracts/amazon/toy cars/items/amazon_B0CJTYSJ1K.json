                "reviewText": "This review is for Onest 2-pc Baby Cars (blue). These arrived quickly, but not in the best shape. They were individually packaged in cellophane bags. Their silicone \u201cshells\u201d were smashed and one was detached in spots. I was able to reattach it with a hooked pick and used a hair dryer to warm and reshape the silicone. The description includes both terms \u201cPush and Go\u201d and \u201cWind Up\u201d so I tested them to find out. They sound and almost feel like they have that pull-back-and-go action, but they are push-and-go only. I do like how the wheels have some resistance and they retain momentum a little. The head of the turtle and the eyes/hood of the car (truck?) are meant to move when the wheels are in motion, which they do but barely noticeable. Again, I\u2019m not sure if this is a malfunction or if it\u2019s just how they\u2019re made. The listing has the age these are meant for as 3 months and up, but the packaging had a choking hazard warning for children under 3 years. I assume this is because if the silicone shell becomes unattached (which mine was on arrival), the rattle inside is small enough to be a choking risk. Personally, I find the rattle to be annoying. If a parent wanted to, they could detach part of the silicone shell to remove the rattle, making it not only quieter, but safer. I ordered these for my 6-month old grandnephew for Christmas but I\u2019m going to hang on to them until he\u2019s a little older. These little cars are super cute, but I\u2019d only buy them if they were at least half the list price of ten dollars when this was written.",

                "reviewText": "These come packaged in individual baggies. The wheels spin easily and there's a ball with a bell inside that jostles around to make a fun toy for newly mobile kiddos to chase after. The toys look approachable and not creepy, and are lightweight enough for little hands to pick up.However, it says only use for kids 3yrs+, which I don't think is the target demographic for this toy at all. I don't see any obvious choke hazards, unless maybe the ball got out of it's soft silicone \"cage\", or maybe there's a small screw keeping the wheel axles on? If you use the toy as directed, I think it's play life is limited.",
