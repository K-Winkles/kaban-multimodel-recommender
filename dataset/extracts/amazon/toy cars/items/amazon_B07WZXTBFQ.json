I'm not a big fan of the full sized model as everyone I've ever talked with who had one hated it after a few weeks, so I decided to take the risk and get this for my wife. I'm happy to say that she has a good sense of humor and did not kill me. She even posted on Facebook that I bought her the G Wagon she asked for. It worked out better than I expected.",
