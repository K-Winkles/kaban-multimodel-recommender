Cars, ubiquitous in daily life and the subject of our products, represent many things: an engineering marvel, a beautiful art form, the star of bedroom posters, and to many, a lifelong dream. We believe everyone deserves to dream, and our mission is to make dream cars\u2014albeit a scaled down version. Over the years we have launched scale models and cartoon cars under our brand name KINSMART and KINSFUN, respectively. Today, we have acquired from more than 30 car manufacturers to produce authentic car models, amounting to over 200 and counting. We\u2019ve poured our hearts and souls into our products, and we hope it brings a smile to everyone across the world.",
