                "reviewText": "Fifi is adorable, and she was a big success with a very young recipient. Probably best for 3 months +. I do wonder why Amazon has priced the female firefly higher than the male (Freddy). The toys are almost identical, except the colors. Fifi is more pastel. This gender-based pricing reminds me of the dry cleaner , who charges more for \"ladies\" shirts vs men's .. even when they are identical in style, size, design, etc. The toy itself is great, the kids just seem transfixed by these wide eyed bugs and they grab onto the crinkle-wings and other \"appendages\". I've given four Freddy dolls and one Fifi as gifts.... I think they're a little smaller now than they used to be ( or maybe Fifi is smaller than Freddy?) but the children still love them. The smaller size may be less intimidating to very young kids. It keeps them fully engaged ... It's really amazing to watch how absorbed they become with their new little \"friend.\" Great for the car, in restaurants, anywhere where you want to keep the little ones occupied, entertained, and quiet. I especially like how the toy continues to intrigue the child as he or she develops... Black and white shapes for newborns, colors, squeaky sounds, tactile responsive materials, a mirror, and even a teething ring. I've been told repeatedly that Freddy has become a favorite toy. As for Fifi, I saw with my own eyes that when she was first unwrapped, she seemed to be a big hit. A clingy 2 month old who never lets her mom take a break didn't even notice she was gone for ten minutes once Fifi joined the mix. That's some toy! It's well thought out, well made, and fun. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "I don't typically write reviews i just leave start ratings. Let me start with the fact that i always pay full price and no one has asked me for this review, i just thought this one needed one and you and your little bundle of joy would really appreciate it. 1st things 1st. In a world where it seems quality is 2nd to volume of sells, this company, Tomy definitely puts quality first. There are features that you may not realize this toy has so I will try to break them down for you 1 by 1.1. It is much larger than the pics show. It measures around 12 in x 13 in across.2. It has a different array of textures across the body section3. The legs are tied in knots to create a hard feeling against the soft body (even though they are fabric) giving your little one a new sensation.4. One of the upper wings has a flap with what seems like eyeball holes for your child to look through and when you Lift the flap it is a plastic mirror that seems very durable.5. There is another wing with a squeaky ball in it.6. The colors are brilliant and will captivate your little one.7. There is a pocket in one of the bottom wings that holds a tethered teething ring in it.8. The back is all black and white contrast striped and polk a dots.9. There is a large snap ring at the top to hang on car seat, swing etc...10. The bottom has 2 rings for the little one to hold onto, teeth on our whatever.11. There are 3 little flaps of fabric on the inside of the top right wing that are all just different textured flaps. Obviously they didn't have to add that but there fact that they did speaks volumes about the integrity and quality this company stands behind.Nothing in this toy is second rate. I can honestly say that this is the best toy we have so far for our little one! I feel like this company put a lot of research into early child development stimulation research and packed this toy full of those results.Way to go Tomy. I will always recommend you to any of our friends with children. Keep up the good work and thank you for the wonderful toy.",

                "reviewText": "My baby loves this toy! We bought it for a very long road trip when she was 6 months old. It occupied her for quiet a while. She loved the crinkle fabrics and the rattles and the rings to teeth on. Seems very durable and should last a while. She is now 8 months and still loves playing with it.It says it\u2019s not machine washable, so that is a down side. I also thought the toy part bungeed from the top ring (so if you pulled down on the toy, it could extend from where it was connected) but it does not. This made it harder for my baby to reach the toy if I hung it from her car seat or stroller. But other than that, it\u2019s wonderful.",
