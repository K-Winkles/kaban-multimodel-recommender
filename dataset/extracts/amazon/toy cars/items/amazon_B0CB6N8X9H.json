        "description": "With three character cars to recreate one of Disney and Pixar's Cars iconic scenes, the Frank Escape and Stunt Race playset is an exciting action-packed way to play with favorite characters. Remember, tractor tipping is all fun and games until Frank shows up! The set has two easy to set up configurations: Frank Escape and Stunt Race. In Frank Escape mode, Lightning McQueen will move in a straight shot to avoid the menacing Frank vehicle chasing after him, knocking over an unassuming tractor and Welcome to Radiator Springs sign in the process. Stunt Race mode sets up a ramp to jump over the hay bales and escape the angry combine. With everything for out of the box play, including Lightning McQueen, a tractor and Frank, who doubles as a launcher, the set makes a great gift for Cars fans ages 4 years old and up. Colors and decorations may vary.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This Frank Escape and Stunt playset is fun to play with by its self and also makes a great addition to the coordinating playsets. Frank's pull back spring action is powerful, so the plastic, Lightning McQueen car really flies. I'm sure that it would also work with a McQueen die cast car. The set can be used with the ramp up or down allowing McQueen to either fly through the air or race straight away knocking over the tractor, flying through the gates, and spinning the town sign. This is a great gift for any little, McQueen fan. Highly Recommend",
