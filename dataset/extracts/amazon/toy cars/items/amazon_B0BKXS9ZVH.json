It\u2019s versatile enough to not only go In the car seat but anything with an arm like his gym set, the side of his crib, the arch over his bouncer, and even on a tension rod if need be. It\u2019s durable and somewhat easy to travel with. Unfortunately it\u2019s. It very easy to clean since the toys do not detach. My little loves the toys and is still trying to figure out how each toy works. Although it\u2019s a great distraction, he enjoys it more when we interact with him and his toys to figure out everything about the toy. This is worth the buy! I will add, it\u2019s not long enough for him to grab and pull to his mouth to teethed so I really wouldnt call it a teething toy.",

I washed it in a laundry machine in cold water and then dried in a dryer a couple of times on a delicate regime. All the sounds work after drying! I tried handwashing first but unsuccessfully bc it is really hard to wash the detergent out.",

The snake needs a little more stretch to it so that the toys can hang evenly and the ties at each end of the snake are way too short and it is hard to tie them to the car seat handle for this reason.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. My little guy LOVES this thing but only if I just tie it on both sides of the car seat rather than actually wrapping the spiral as designed. When I use the spiral, it only covers maybe an 8 inch portion of the bar, and if I try to stretch it then the hanging toys don\u2019t all hang evenly. Either way, the strings are too short for him to actually reach or play with the toys. However, when I tie it as shown in the video, he has a blast.",
