                "reviewText": "As I (father) got ready to drive my 7 m.o. son on a 3.5 hr. car ride solo (w/o mom) a few months ago, I did a LOT of research to make the ride easier for me and my son. I've published my tips below but let me simply say that this Bright Starts car seat toy bar was a late throw-in to my trip and is simply awesome! It truly helped keep my son occupied with its several different built-in toys and because it straps to the car seat handles, he couldn't throw it aside like other toys. Highly recommended.BTW, I saw the comment about \"not safe for moving vehicles;\" well, leave it to lawyers to protect US corporations from litigation. I'm no lawyer and I've had no issues. Personally, I don't see how it could cause trouble, barring a car crash that would bring other issues!Anyhow, without further ado, here is my list of how to successfully travel solo on a long car trip with your baby (#5 includes the reviewed item here!):1. Start with a full tank of gas.2. Leave immediately after feeding.3. Leave during a bed or nap time to maximize sleep in the car.4. Pull down the shades in the car/minivan.5. Have a basket or box of car safe toys and stuffed animals on the passenger seat ready to toss back, as needed to keep baby occupied. Bring a surprise toy (this Bright Starts bar was one for the long drive).6. Consider relaxing music or white noise to play in car (FWIW, my son was never bothered by adult music or talk radio so I listened to this instead!). I think hours of white noise wouldn't be safe for the driver. haha.7. Drive through meal times, if baby is content.8. Save stops for poopy diapers or super fussy time.9. Be flexible and willing to stop, as needed.10. Budget more time, if it becomes needed. Younger babies are easier b/c they sleep more. At 9-15 mos., a drive could take up to 50% longer in my estimation.11. Put safety first (please no comments about how this should be #1--it's a given to me vs. the others, thereby it's lower).",

                "reviewText": "My little guy loves this car seat toy. My sister gifted us one of these at our baby shower and our son loves it so much that I bought a second one to have for the other car seat! He is most fascinated by the light up nose and the Tiger. The songs the tiger plays are kind of catchy too. I often find myself whistling along lol. He likes looking at himself in the mirror and batting at the bead-filled zebra as well. The batteries last for while too. We just replaced them for the first time last week and our son is now almost four months old. The toy has been on his car seat since day one. The songs and the light easily calm our son down when he if fussy. My only complaint is I wish the straps that connect the toy to the car seat were a little more durable. They are elastic with Velcro, but they stretch out easily and become warn quickly. The little watch batteries can also be kind of hard to find.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for my 1 month old son because I wanted something to encourage him to reach out while he was in his car seat. At one month old, he liked to look at it and hear the music play from the middle toy when I pushed the button. By 2 months he would \"shyishly\" bat at the toys but still could not push the music button himself. At 3 months he was able to spin the toys, grab them, and push the music button when he wanted. Now at 4 months old, the music button and sound quality has gone down because of all the use my son has put it thru and I think he is bored with it. I have now have the unfortunate task of finding another car seat toy that he will like and keep him entertained and learning at the same time... The best part of this toy, it has wonderful, adjustable, stretchy straps to fit any carseat!",

                "reviewText": "The bright start take along carrier toy is a cute product that has bright colors, plays a 4 different short songs, and lights up. It is light and portable. It has two elastic velcro straps on both ends to attach to poles/rails of an infant car seat, stroller, etc. The Velcro is strong enough that I do not have to worry about my daughter grabbing or yanking at it and it falling on top of her. Also, the elastic on the ends are a plus because it makes it easy to attach and adjust to different places. I was surprised it came with batteries already in it which was nice because my daughter was able to play with it right away.The tiger's nose lights up when you press it and plays 4 different short jingles. My daughter loves grabbing at the two rings on the tiger and the clanking noises it makes when you play with them. It also comes with a zebra that rattles on one side and on the other it has a mirror that spins when you tap at it.Unfortunately, this does not work with our car seat. We have a Graco SnugRide Click Connect 35 Infant car seat 2015/2016 and the toy would sit too close to her face (literally an inch or two away). When placed higher up, it was useless because she would have to strain looking up and wouldn't be able to grab at it. My sister has one for her son and it works with their car seat without any issues. We were able to still use it on her activity play mat which she loves. She grabs at it with her hands and sometimes kick at it with her feet. We also are able to use it with her bouncer too.This bright starts take along carrier toy would have gotten a 5 star rating if it worked with our infant car seat. I would still recommend it but caution that it may not work with your car seat or have limited use depending on the type of play mat and bouncer you have.",

                "reviewText": "My daughter loves this. I strapped it onto her carseat. I attached it to just one side of the handle as if it were on both you would be constantly attaching and removing every time you put baby in and out. But it works well just on one side. I just swing it out of the carseat when getting her out and swing it back in and on her lap (easier for her to play with there) when she is in there. She plays with it all the time and makes driving in the car more fun for her. Only complaint is that there is not an off button for the tiger. If she falls asleep holding it and moves in her sleep it is easy to bump the nose button and start the music and disturb her sleep. But this is not a deal breaker and I feel it is one of my best purchases.",
