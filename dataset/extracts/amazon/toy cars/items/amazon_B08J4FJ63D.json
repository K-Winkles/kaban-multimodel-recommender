                "reviewText": "I bought these because my son recently got a Pixar car rug that came with a cheaply made plastic Lightening McQueen and Mater as a Xmas present from his Grandma. Bless her heart, but my child's Grandma buys the cheapest plastic toys that break so fast or get ruined and just end up in the garbage polluting our precious planet, and I am doing my best to in life to be grateful but also not purchase things that really are more problematic than some realize. Anyway, within 1 day my son had already completely scratched all the cheap sticker decals that gave Lightening McQueen his entire look. I already buy my son other die-cast cars like hot wheels and grave Digger monster trucks so I decided to search for a die-cast Lightening McQueen and decided on this set of three as it was a better value than just purchasing one Lightening McQueen. Now I'll be able to replace the cheap plastic ones that don't even roll... my son will love these, but I haven't given them to him yet as they are a rewards for Potty training. So glad these are well made, will definitely last and heck I'm sure they're even great for die-cast collectors. I think my son will get a lot of play out of these for years to come.",

His whole face lit up; my three-year-old asked me to please open it immediately, so we unboxed, and he said \"thank you\" and disappeared for HOURS to play with these.
