He is likely too young to play with it much at first, but will really enjoy watching the cars. Our 5 year old has a track and our youngest son just laughs and laughs, watching big brother play with it. Bonus, big brother played with it for about 15 minutes when it arrived and even at 5 he really likes it and was so creative in all the ways he thought to send the cars and even some other toys down the ramp. Our little guy will need supervision with the cars for a while, because he tests things in his mouth, but it will be worth it to supervise his play with it until he will be safe to play with the cars on his own. It seems rather solid and very well painted. We really like it so far!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. It\u2019s a nice little car ramp. It works relatively well. Sometimes the cars do get stuck on the second (yellow) or third (red) ramps which doesn't frustrate my 20 month old, but it does gunk up the train of cars. It is smaller than I expected, but it is perfect for table top play. It feels quite small when it\u2019s on the floor and your child is hunched over it. The cars a very tiny, very tiny, which makes sense when you see how small this ramp is, but my son has no problem handling them. My other critique is there really should be somewhere to store the cars. Perhaps a divot in the bottom where the cars can slide in, otherwise I feel people are much more likely to loose them \u2014 especially when the cars are so small. The last thing I would love, but this one is being nit-picky, but if there was a car collector at the bottom, like in a marble run that would be \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc.",

I was a bit concerned about the size of the 'cars' possibly being a choking hazard since there was no info about the size of the cars in the description. I posted a message on the site and the seller answered shortly afterwards with the dimensions of the cars. I bought it and my grandson LOVED it. He played with it for long stretches of time.It is well made and sturdy, the wood is smooth and so are the little cars. The little cars are big enough that they do not pose a choking hazard for an 18 months old. I love it and am glad I purchased it for him.",
