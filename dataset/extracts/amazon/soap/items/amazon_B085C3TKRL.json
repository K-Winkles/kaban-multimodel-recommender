                "reviewText": "So hotel motel style soap, it's gets the job done smells of clean cotton or linens it's milled soap and just gritty enough to be a good lighty abrasive to help get the job done. Cleans well as you would hope after a shower I feel clean, bar didn't break or dissolve in one go, as a hand soap I don't notice any bathroom smells after using it and would trust my hands are mess free, it won't clean out your fingernails alone without a scrubber, and for those who think soaps need lather that's not actually true, it is low lather and takes a bit of rinsing though this only ensures your hands are clean, leaves a pleasant fresh scent that's not over bearing. Individually wrapped which is great for guests and the single man who's cheap like me.Well worth it considering the alternatives out there. Soap shouldn't cost much and should at the very least make you smell clean this does the job well enough. If I went to a hotel or motel I'd be happy to find this for a hot shower or the cleanup stage of the night.",
