Nothing illegal about this good stuff.",

                "reviewText": "These bars last a really long time. Usually 3-4 months per bar. They do tend to designate towards the end though. I highly recommend using the Duke Cannon soap pouch as it's the correct size for these large bars and it holds up really well.As for the smell, I've tried two different scents, Leaf and Leather as well as Gunsmoke. My roommate said Leaf and Leather smells like an adventures backpack which I agree with. It's a very pulp action hero smell except without the sweat and BO. Quite masculine and natural smelling. Women also dig it. Recommended.Gunsmoke had me annoyed because the bar smells nothing like gun smoke nor does the lather in the shower. However, when I smelled myself after using it, I smelled like I had been standing downwind on a range for hours. It was uncannily accurate and I was really pleasantly surprised. If you want to smell like gun smoke, this will make you smell like gun smoke.Both scents last all day depending on how much you sweat.Overall, I'm a big fan of Duke Cannon soap. It's a good value for money, it smells nice and it gets you good and clean. Strong recommend from me.",

                "reviewText": "When I was in the USA I finally bought a bar of Duke Cannon soap. It was the tobacco whiskey scent and I love it! After 4.5 months of use its still going strong albeit much thinner. This is a great brand and I love the way the 'brick' feels in my hands. Unfortunately, Amazon.de doesn't carry all variants of Duke Cannon products so I decided to go with this WWII Navy themed scent. Its nice but I prefer the first one I got. I would like to buy the 'tactical scrub bag' but I'm not paying 64 euros when you can get it for less than 18 dollars in the States.All in all I highly recommend!",
