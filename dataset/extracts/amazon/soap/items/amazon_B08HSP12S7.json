At first I thought it was a bit pricey, but because it's lasting so long (I'm still on my first bar) it's well worth the money. It cleans my skin very well and leaves it soft. It doesn't dry my skin out at all, and it doesn't get uncomfortable in sensitive areas. The smell is heavenly. It makes my bathroom smell like it has flowers in it. Though it smells like flowers it also smells clean and fresh. I'll be buying this again. I just love it.",

                "reviewText": "I love the mild not lingering smell (I'm autistic and smells can give me headaches and nausea), it doesn't dry my skin in the winter, the charcoal is perfectly exfoliating, it's very sudsy and smooth. I usually cut the bar in thirds and it lasts me so long! Great value, three bars probably lasts me a year. It's the only bar soap I use now.",

Does not leave a lasting scent on the skin after washing. Longevity of the bar is very good, but it is in fact a big bar. Moisturizing is not as good as other brands we have had previously, but not bad. More desired from a soap of this price.",
