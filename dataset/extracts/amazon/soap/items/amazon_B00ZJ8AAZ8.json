I have sensitive skin especially on my face and it moisturizes my face without built up to cause bumps. It is one of very few soaps that I have used over the years that works so well. I have aging skin which needs more moisture now and it does just that. As I age and become wiser I now look for products that are more natural and without the long list of ingredients filled with numbers and words I can\u2019t pronounce and ingredients that will not give me cancer and other illnesses. It is also one of the few products these days that has very few ingredients and more natural. I find the fragrance to be relaxing as well.I would recommend this product and I am not someone that readily review a product and recommends without time and testing because I believe only time and regular usage will stand up to the test and scrutiny.",

I also use it on my face from time to time with no ill effects or dryness. Highly recommended.",
