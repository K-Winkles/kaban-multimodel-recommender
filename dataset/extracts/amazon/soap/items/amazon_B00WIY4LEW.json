The lesions started multiplying, i went to the doctors who gave me an ointment gel, which did absolutely nothing for me, it was an acne treatment.Since it started getting hotter and summer was near i knew i had to act fast or else i would have to wear pants all summer. First things first, from my research it states not to shave to prevent he spread of Folliculitis, so yes i did just that. I didn't shave for over a month...i know gross but it had to be done.*If you do decide to shave, use a new fresh blade every time you shave in order to prevent spread. Also if you have folliculitis on your legs don't use the same blade on your armpits etc.I looked up items on amazon and read reviews for \"Almond Clear: Body Clearing Serum\" https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0866B6CV1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1I decided to give it a try, i started with Level 1 and used it with the Hibliclens antibacterial soap as everyone in the reviews did. I already had the soap since its so amazing and i recommend everyone have thissoap in their home it works miracles. I was already using this soap by itself for about 2 weeks prior to buying the Almond Clear bottle and i noticed no difference. When i read that buyers were combining both Almond Clear Serum and the soap i decided to do the same, but still i felt that Hibliclens did not do much for me. My Folliculitis was very stubborn!https://www.amazon.com/Molnlycke-Hibiclens-HIBICLENS-LIQ-OZ/dp/B00E5R65SA/ref=sr_1_3?crid=GNSU7PU7YVEN&dchild=1&keywords=hibiclens&qid=1590613599&refinements=p_85%3A2470955011&rnid=2470954011&rps=1&sprefix=hibi%2Caps%2C234&sr=8-3*Everyone is different so what works for someone might not work for others.As for the Almond Clear serum, i noticed immediately a difference! overnight the lesions seemed like they shrunk.The only complaint is that the bottle doesn't contain much. I had a big area to cover so 1 bottle was finished in 1 week. I would definitely recommend you purchase the bigger bottle so its worth your money (they have the 4oz option available). Also level 1 is more for someone who might have like 1-4 lesions..or for sensitive areas like the face. I felt like it made a difference but i definitely needed something stronger to completely get rid of them, i should've skipped to level2 like everyone else did in the reviews.I bought level 2 when i ran out of level 1 and i definitely noticed a huge difference! Listen to me right now, if you suffer from severe Folliculitis YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS!Honestly my case got so bad i had so many lesions on my groin area they started spreading down to my thighs and legs and even my private area :(i was so stressed i couldn't wear shorts and even pants would cause me to breakout in hives and the infected areawould get so red and irritated easily. It got bad!Luckily this product saved my life..I started using this April 20, today is May 27 and i am pretty much cured, the lesions are all gone and even the scars are faded! This product faded the nasty dark marks.The reviews recommend using up to 2xs a day. This did not work for me, my skin is very sensitive so i would only use 1x a day, every night after i showered i would apply and leave overnight. I do have to say that this product makes your skin peel and drys your skin out. For me, it made my skin excessively dry and i would shed skin almost everyday.Because my skin was getting beyond dry i decided to moisturize. I used CeraVe Moistorizing Lotion every morning when i woke up.*(make sure to always wash your hands before and after you apply a product to prevent from spreading to other body parts).https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YJ2SLG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1I used this lotion because alot of people with skin issues use this lotion and it works well, i had no issues, great product!I shower every night so i decided to use a Folliculitis body wash i found on Amazon. I leave it on the area for about 5 mins then i rinse. I also noticed a big difference with this product right after the 1st use! I used this product for about 1.5 months?https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GBL3RES/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s04?ie=UTF8&psc=1Another product i used in the shower was the Nizoral Shampoo. I saw YouTube videos of people who used it on their arms and face to treat folliculitis. Luckily i already had this shampoo as well, its to treat dandruff, i recommend for both dandruff and for folliculitis, i feel like this items made a difference. I replaced the Hibliclens soap with this product, i leave it on the area for about 5 mins then rinse in the shower. I used this product for about a month.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AINMFAC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1The final product i used was Defense Soap, i used this soap in order to kill any bacteria or fungi that might have been causing the Folliculitis. I felt like this also made a difference and i washed my whole body with this in order to prevent any Folliculitis from spreading on my stomach or arms...I was terrified of getting it any where else, the soap makes you feel fresh and clean specially after a workout! It does dry your skin so you don't have to use everyday, but if you do i would definitely recommend to moisturize with the CeraVe lotion or just any lotion in general. I used this product for about a month.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HYBK2YF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1*Be sure to use these products EVERYDAY, TO SEE RESULTS YOU HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT.If you are on a budget: Out of all the products i would definitely recommend you use the Almond Clear Serum and the Folliculitis Body Wash by Ovante. Yes i know this is a VERY LONG routine and so many products to use, but all my folliculitis is pretty much gone already! It is pricey to buy all these items, but honestly i was willing to pay $100+ in order to get rid of this and it was worth it!I guess it depends how bad do you want to get rid of this? I think its worth it!Do your research, find out what works for you, try different products until you find something that works for your skin. I HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEONE!",

                "reviewText": "First off, this soap isn't your average shower buddy. It's packed with tea tree oil, which is like a natural warrior against bacteria and funky odors. After a tough workout or grappling session, this soap kicks in and leaves you feeling refreshed and clean, without that lingering smell of sweat.The thing I love most about it is how it doesn't dry out my skin. You know, some soaps can leave you feeling all stripped of moisture, but not this one. The tea tree oil seems to balance things out, leaving my skin feeling clean but not desert-dry.The lather? Oh man, it's just right. You get that satisfying foam, and it washes off easily without leaving any residue. Plus, the refreshing scent of tea tree oil, although quite strong initially, mellows down, leaving this subtle, clean fragrance that's not overpowering.The fact that it's all-natural is a big plus for me. No harsh chemicals or weird stuff. Just good old natural ingredients doing their job.Now, it's not a magic cure for skin conditions or anything, but if you're looking for a solid soap that's tough on post-workout grime and easy on the skin, this DEFENSE Tea Tree Bar Soap might just be your new go-to. It's become a staple in my gym bag, and I highly recommend it to any guy who wants a refreshing, natural, and effective soap after a tough training session.",

I think this should be highly marketed for everyone in addition to those who work out, wrestling etc. We realized it helps with skin itchiness and irritation when we ran out of the soap. The smell is nice too. It is a little costly, but I will continue to order it because it does work so well.",
