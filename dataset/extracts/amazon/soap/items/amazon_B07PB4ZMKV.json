I look for soap that is hardmilled, great scent and moisturizing; W&L Sandelwood and Patchouli is the best (I've purchased other W&L scents, but I haven't gotten to them yet). My journey with bar soap began as a child in the 50s; mom's faves were Sweet Heart and Palmolive. As an adult I graduated to Dial. In my later adult years, as my skin weathered, I looked for soaps that left my skin soft and lightly scented. I won't go thru the list of brands I've used (frankly, some were quite good) but W&L is a real find; and it's incredibly creamy. (And to think I wasn't going to try these because they're made in Austraila) They're pricey, but not as much as some that aren't as good. I use a deodorant soap for the warmer months, but for the cold season, this is my holy grail. If you're a bar-soap-snob like me, this is the one.",

                "reviewText": "I've tried multiple scents of this soap. Goat Milk: Very mild scent. Honey & Almond: Exactly what you are hoping for. Smells like almond extract/marzipan. Basil Lime and Mandarin: a little more floral and less what I expected, I can't identify any of the three scents. It's not overpowering, but don't buy this searching for a citrus smell. Sicilian Orange: smells like Satsuma from The Body Shop YUM. Vanilla Bean: Light vanilla scent. Ice Cream: Lightly sweet scent. Almost like a sweet vanilla...sort of like Neapolitan ice cream.These soaps are triple milled and last longer than some cold or hot pressed ones. Using this exclusively in my daily shower, a bar lasts a good couple weeks. The only hard part about these soaps is that since they are hard and never soften, it's hard to 'marry' the old one to the new one when you get down to the small parts. Clearly I have re-ordered many times, and will continue to do so.",
