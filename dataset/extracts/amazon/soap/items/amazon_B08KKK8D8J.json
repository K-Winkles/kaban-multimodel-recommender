It's a good brand, I like the smell, the look, the bottle but the packaged box was open on one side, the bottles are just thrown in the Method box and one bottle was leaking a bit. I would buy this soap again, just not from the same place I ordered from. If a company sends you damaged products, why bother even ordering from them when I can drop the product in the store and buy it damaged.This only received two stars because I like the soap, the shipper who sent it out gets 0 stars",
