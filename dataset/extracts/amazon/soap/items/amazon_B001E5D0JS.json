This soap not only cleanses me properly but my wife love the smell of my body after taking showers. It more price efficient also to buy the 6 pack it comes in to save a little money.Pros:Doesn't break my skin out in hives.No irritation at all after usage.One bar lasts a long time. Much longer than brand name soaps like Dove.Creates a great lather on large face towels.Cons:Much more expensive than brand name soaps in retail stores.",

This soap is very mild on my sensitive skin, lathers nicely even in hard water, and has a neutral scent. The bar lasts longer than South Of France bars. All natural, not tested on animals and no animal ingredients. The multi-pack is a good price, imo, and convenient to keep my closet stocked. Will buy again!",
