Works with any ADX-7 700mL dispenser (which you can get for as little as $6.00). Great scent, quality foaming hand soap. Keeps the counter clear by keeping the dispenser off the counter. I actually figured out the price down to each squirt and this this cheaper to buy than your cheap hand soap and a brick and mortar store. Our family highly recommends this.Link to a dispenser that works with this product: GOJO 8788-06 ADX-7 Brushed Chrome Compact Dispenser, 700mL Capacity If the location you place your dispenser can make a mess on the wall or floor then you may want to add a wall protector to your dispenser: GOJ1045BLK12 - Shield Floor amp; Wall Protector, Black",

                "reviewText": "I've been a dedicated user of the Gojo Clear & Mild Foam Handwash for quite some time now, and I must say, it's a product that continually impresses. I've purchased this refill pack multiple times (about 10 times!), and each time, it has consistently delivered on its promise of quality and reliability.The EcoLogo certification is a significant highlight for me. I deeply appreciate Gojo's commitment to creating a product that not only cleans effectively but also aligns with environmental standards. It's reassuring to know that I'm using a product that's both efficient and eco-friendly.The mildness of this handwash is truly remarkable. It cleanses thoroughly without drying out my skin, even with frequent use. The foam formula is gentle yet effective, leaving my hands feeling fresh and clean after each wash.The packaging in a pack of 4 is convenient and cost-effective. I find that the 700 mL size offers long-lasting use, making it a practical and economical choice for regular use, especially in high-traffic areas.The compatibility with the ADX-7 Push-Style Dispenser is a fantastic feature. It's easy to refill, and the dispenser ensures that the handwash dispenses smoothly without any hassle.The consistency in quality across each refill pack I've purchased is commendable. I've experienced no variance in performance or quality, which speaks volumes about the brand's commitment to maintaining high standards.In conclusion, the Gojo Clear & Mild Foam Handwash has earned my trust and loyalty. Its eco-friendly certification, gentle yet effective cleansing, and convenience in use make it a staple in my household. I highly recommend this product to anyone seeking a reliable and eco-conscious handwash solution. Five stars all the way!",

                "reviewText": "These fit the Micrel 8790-06 ADX7 soap dispenser which I purchased separately for a small bathroom. Instructions are on enclosed bag, not on the bottle. The soap smells herbal. It does not smell like flowers. Foamy but I can still feel the soap. It does not feel watered down. Hands come clean, nobody has gotten sick or rashy from using it. I was hesitant to buy due to price. I checked the dispenser after 3 weeks and the bottle is still nearly full. It collapses inward as it empties. A lot of people, family and visitors have used this soap in our little bathroom. I feel better about the price now that I've seen I won't be running out any time soon. In fact I'm saving the little bag with instructions in case I forget how to fill the dispenser. The soap and the Micrel dispenser solved the no vanity top problem in a frequently used small bathroom. Pics are of one unopened bottle, and one that has been in use for 3 weeks. You can see the green soap through the window of the dispenser.",
