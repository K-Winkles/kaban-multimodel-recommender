                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Comparisons in my review. White Dove is more of a one size fits all.",
                "reviewText": "I absolutely love Dove's beauty bars. I used to use Olay, and I still like those too, but I felt like changing thing's up and had heard good things about Dove. We started with these White Dove bars, and then the pink coconut milk bars, and the cucumber bars. We really like all of them, honestly. I would say this White Dove is probably more of a one size fits all bar due to it not having any dye in it's color, and the scent being more mild. The pink coconut bar is pink in color and still has a light scent. It doesn't smell like the usual summer coconut smell sometimes associated with coconut smells, but more of a light milky floral coconut. This pink is probably my 2nd favorite, although it might be more of a tie with the pink and these White bars. The Cool cucumber bar is light green, has the strongest scent, and is definitely my personal favorite, (but because I am not sensitive to fragrances, and absolutely love it's scent). I love how fresh and cool it smells and feels, and enjoy the extra scent when showering.I actually think all of these Dove bars work the same when it comes to cleaning, moisturizing, and their overall quality, and they all make me feel clean and fresh, which I think is what most of us are looking for after a shower. I like the shape of these bars too, because they fit perfectly in your palm while washing and don't slip away easily when going over an uneven body part. For those of you who are sensitive to dyes or fragrances, and are looking for less of these things for any reason, I would recommend these White Dove bars. The White has the least fragrance of the 3 in my opinion, although it does still have a fresh smell, but is not overpowering, in my opinion. Dove also offers a Sensitive Dove bar if you're someone looking for even less of everything, but I have not personally tried those to compare.These Dove Beauty bars really feel great for your skin. My skin never feels tight and overly dry with these Dove bars like a lot of regular bar soaps do. I used to hate bar soaps growing up because of that feeling, and turned to body wash for years as an adult. After meeting my husband, and gaining weight and health problems after my second pregnancy and always feeling hot and sweaty, I didn't feel like body wash on a loofah was enough, at least not the small amount that used to suffice. He used bar soap, so I dredgingly gave it a try after swearing against it. Surprisingly I did feel cleaner, but again, I had that icky dry feeling. I researched and found Olay at the time, which is what I have been using since my daughter was born 9yrs ago. That is until about a year ago when we first switched to Dove.These are called beauty bars because they're made mostly of moisturizers, rather than \"soap.\" That's why your skin feels clean AND SOFT after washing. If you still feel like you need a \"soap\" to get fully clean, I recommend keeping one of these in the shower to use after scrubbing with the soap bar, because this will help to remoisturize your skin and prevent that icky dry and weird tight feeling when using only bar soap. That will help make these last even longer too, but of course will cost you to keep both on hand. Of course, those soap bars are usually cheaper, so it will even out some. Olay is honestly just as good, and is also considered a beauty bar, but unfortunately it's harder to find them in these bigger ounce bars, so we will probably stick to Dove for awhile. Dove bars do seem to get used up a little faster, but we're enjoying the change for now, especially if we can continue finding them at a good value on here using the subscribe and save. I recommend you giving Dove a try if you want to feel clean while still leaving your skin feeling smooth when you step out of the shower. My whole family of 4 really likes all 3 of the ones we've used, and it's usually hard to please everyone in my household. I hope my experience and my pictures help give you an idea of what to expect in person.",
