                "reviewText": "We love this soap in the citrus and mint scent. My son, who is 10, has been using it as his bath soap and shampoo for years now (I think probably 3 or 4 years now?) - and he won't use anything else. He has sensitive skin and it's always been just right for him. It smells wonderful, leaves him squeaky clean, and it so easy for a boy his age to have one bottle of soap to do it all. The other day, I walked in his room and asked what smelled so good - I thought he'd brought one of my expensive diffusers upstairs or something like that! Then I realized he'd just gotten out of the shower and it was him that smelled so wonderful.It also makes a great hand soap - smells wonderful and luxurious.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Best Shampoo Ever (For Me, Anyway. YMMV)",
                "reviewText": "TL;DR: Fantastic shampoo for straight, slightly oily hair; really good body wash that smells nice in the bath/shower and effectively leaves no discernable scent behind. Doesn't overdry my skin. Lathers well even in water that's basically liquid limestone. Good price, too. A rare 10/10.---The Details---I. As Shampoo-This is my all-time favorite shampoo & body wash. I'd use it for shampoo even if I didn't like it as a body wash, because it leaves my hair clean, light (as opposed to heavy), silky, and shiny without excessively stripping the oils from my scalp.I don't find it necessary to use any kind of conditioner with it, either, which is nice, because my hair tends to be a little oily and using conditioner means that after a dayn in the studio (I'm a dancer, and I swear a LOT), it's already kinda gross.-II. Scent-If you want something that leaves a detectable scent behind, this isn't the ideal product for you. It smells lovely (but not overpowering) while you're showering or bathing, but just leaves you smelling like a clean human.This is perfect for me, as I enjoy a nice-smelling bath or shower as much the next person, but don't want to smell like anything in the ballet studio, where we're all breathing hard and scented products can trigger asthma attacks, etc.-III. Moisturizing?-As for moisturizing, I wouldn't call this a moisturizing body wash. Rather, it dries your skin less than most; it might actually just be completely neutral in that regard. That's fine with me. If my skin feels dry, I use lotion.Your mileage may vary, however\u2014our water is so hard it's basically mineral water, so this stuff night behave differently if your water is soft, for example.-IV. Value-Depending on how often I shower or bathe, a bottle of this lasts me from 1 to 2 months, maybe longer? I never think to write down the date I start using a new one, but I will next time I do so I can report back with actual useful information.-V. Rating-Even though I only tend to review products I either hate or love, there are few I'd call a 10 out of 10. This is one of them.Because hair types and bodies differ, it might not be a 10/10 for you, but it's worth a try if you're looking for a new shampoo or body wash.",

                "reviewText": "Everyone 3 in 1 soap citrus and mint doesn't have much of a smell. That's exactly what i wanted. Lasts very long time. Been using for years. It's not drying, but wouldn't say moisturizing, more neutral. can use all the time and sent doesn't compete with any of my essential oils i use in my lotion which is also EO non scented and very moisturizing, clean feel, not greasy and you can add any scent to the moisturizer you want or not. Will continue to buy both products! My skin is sensitive and loves Everyone brand!",

                "reviewText": "The citrus mint is a mild scent. It lathers well. While I have not used it for shamooo on myself I have used it on my yorkie. It worked well to get his hair clean. I have always been careful to use a different tear free shampoo on his face; since this is not tear free, I did use a separate shampoo for his head. I\u2019ve always used human shampoo on him since dog shampoo does not work well on yorkie\u2019s hair. I like that it is organic; I don\u2019t worry about it being harmful to his skin etc. I think in a pinch I could use it as shampoo, but I really require a moisturizing shampoo for my dry hair. I use it as shower gel and feel that it lathers and cleans well.",
