Use Grandpa's with just warm water, not too hot. lather leave it on for a bit, don't scrub your face too hard and rinse off. Tip from my dermatologist, have a red spot, mix a little water paste with soap and dab it on and leave it on. I have been on Plexion, Clindagel Ithink for me this works the best with the sulphur. I also use sparingly, not daily, Tazorac .05% for a nice peel. Don't notice a terrible sulphur smell. works wonders, and calms your skin down. Over heated while exercising, ice water on your face. I am ordering more today.",

The instructions say to use it twice a day, however.The few blackheads I had, on my nose are gone and my face is nice, smooth and acne free.It does smell like sulfur though. It's not too overpowering, but even after I get out of the shower I can smell it. The smell does go away though. I usually use my body wash after I use the soap, that way I can cancel out the sulfur scent.The smell, notwithstanding, it's a great acne soap and I will repurchase.",

                "reviewText": "It does have a bit of a smell of sulfur while you use it but it is not noticeable once its rinsed.It works fairly well for a natural soap but I feel like it requires a lot of lather in order to really be effective. At first it didn't seem to be working but after the first week, I started to lather much more and it then seemed to make a difference in reducing my acne. But in my opinion, it is not consistent enough.At that point, I feel like I need to use more of it than I would with other acne bars like the X-Out body bar. And it is not as effective as other bars so this is something to think about.",
