I have found two that I can use all day at work and not have an issue. My wife has sensitive skin, the same two soaps work well for her without making her skin dry.Soap 1: Provon pink anti-bacterial liquid hand soap. (NOT THE BLUE CRAP)Soap 2: Seventh Generation Mandarin Orange and Grapefruit liquid hand soap.I like the light and refreshing scent of this one. We like to thin it out an make a foaming hand soap out of it using about 60 mL soap to 200 mL distilled water. Still cleans, uses less product therefore more environmentally friendly, doesn't dry and clog pump, saves money.Can't seem to find the refills for this soap anymore, so had to order a case of 8 small bottles... what a waste.",

One is half full, the one that leaked, I am simply happy to get it and it so rare that something like this happens with anything I order from Amazon, that I will simple move on.
