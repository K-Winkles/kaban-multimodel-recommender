Our most popular collections Naturally European, Delray Beach and Tropical Fruits are completely paraben and SLS free. Everything we do is tested in-house as we believe strongly against animal cruelty and as a result we do not sell into China. Each year we introduce new products and review our existing collections based on customer feedback and industry trends. We manufacture products in the UK, Portugal, Belgium, South Africa, Guatemala and China, as we understand budgets vary and this enables us to offer a range of different prices points. We own Serendipity, an excellent manufacturing facility in South Africa which allows us to support the local community. Ultimately, we design, manufacture and distribute products we are proud of and would happily use or give to our loved ones. Design is at the core of our business. Our large team of extremely gifted designers, tirelessly create exquisite packaging for each and every product. Our designs range from traditionally classic to humorously contemporary and consideration goes into each and every detail.

It\u2019s expensive and much more expensive than BBB, but with BBB going out of business, this is where I can find it since it\u2019s very hard to find. Still worth it I think, I have it on subscription.",

                "reviewText": "What a disappointment! I so love the smell of orange blossoms having grown them myself, and this bar of soap was not even close. The main scent was a chemical smell that reminds me of the brown antiseptic that used to be used in surgery to clean skin. There was also a faint scent of coal tar which blew off after about 4 days because I didn't have time to throw the bar away...sigh! The bar does come wrapped in lovely paper, which I suppose influenced my purchase, but I hope that my review will help you to not make the same mistake.",

                "reviewText": "So happy to have found this bar soap! I've been searching for a good replacement after Crabtree & Evelyn went under a couple of years ago, and this one has such a lovely rose scent.The soap is moisturizing and doesn't leave my hands feeling dry, though my hands are not quite as soft as when using a luxury soap like Yardley or the old Crabtree products.Also, the soap bar is very large. As others have mentioned, I needed to cut it in half as it was too large to comfortably use for hand washing. Not a big deal - just means it'll last longer.Biggest selling point is the smell - I've tried several rose scents and this one best captures the delicate, floral notes of roses.",

The blocky shape may be to make production easy but it would be brilliant to have the choice of a smaller size for us pensioners.",
