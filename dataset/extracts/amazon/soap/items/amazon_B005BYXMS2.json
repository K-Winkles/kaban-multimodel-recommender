That\u2019s why diluting them with another substance, such as a carrier oil, lotion or shampoo, is so important. Here's a way to use Essential Oils Essential oils are a great addition to any household-cleaning regimen. This spring, swap out your cleaning supplies for ones made with all-natural ingredients. All-Purpose Cleaner Ingredients: 1 c. White vinegar1 c. Distilled Water8-10 drops Lemon Essential OilPlastic spray bottle Combine all ingredients in bottle. Shake well before each use. Safety Precautions for Essential Oils As you all know, essential oils provide endless benefits to your well-being. With that being said, there are some safety precautions to take when using these beneficial oils. As with all essential oils, never use them undiluted. Do not take internally unless working with a qualified and expert practitioner. Keep away from children and pets. If applying an essential oil to your skin always perform a small patch test to an insensitive part of the body (after you have properly diluted the oil in an appropriate carrier).",

Right out of the package the soap had a strong scent, not quite the way I remember Patchouli but it's difficult to exactly remember a scent I haven't smelled in 40 years! It was a good smell, and I was eager to try it. I used it in the shower, where I have built in recesses in the tile for soap, razors, shampoo, etc. As soon as the soap got wet, the colors in the soap started to drip and run down the shower wall. The soap is good quality, but after the first shower and the colors running, I suspect that most of the scent was in the outer layer of the soap bar.However, it does still smell like Patchouli after several uses, though not nearly as strong as the first use. It is a nice soap.",
