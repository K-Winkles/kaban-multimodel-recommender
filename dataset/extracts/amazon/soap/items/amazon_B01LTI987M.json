                "reviewText": "Whether you buy this brand through Amazon or your local favorite store, I can assure you honestly that the product you're getting is exactly the same item. Some reviewers claim it seems a lot more watery when you buy it through Amazon but that's really not the case. Anti bacterial soap when applied in general is never as thick and creamy as a regular national brand hand soap because the active ingredient itself prevents that from happening in the first place. It's the active ingredient called Benzalkonium Chloride which provides the anti bacterial protection in the soap itself which tends to make the anti bacterial hand soap a lot more watery regardless of which brand you select and considerably less foamy. However, it still suds up more than adequately enough to properly clean your hands under most normal hand washing conditions. I've also used Dial Complete Anti-bacterial soap and the same active ingredient here in Soft soap is exactly the same. Absolutely no difference. The bottom line here is that it really comes down to your own personal priorities as to which product is actually better. Product features like the scent of the liquid or the ergonomic design of the container can all play heavily in on your final decision as to which product you purchase.. Another area of frequent comparison is that both products claim moisturizing ingredients which are supposed to keep your hands softer. Personally, i don't see any difference in either product when it comes to moisturizing your hands. In fact, that's probably the main downside of both products as the antibacterial ingredient regardless of which product you purchase tends to dry your skin more versus using a non antibacterial hand soap you might choose to use instead. Most importantly from a monetary standpoint Soft Soap offers it's product here in a 50 fluid ounce size container and Dial Complete offers instead a 52 fluid ounce bottle. Consequently, it may ultimately just come down to which brand offers the lower price per ounce at any given moment when you're ready to make your purchase as to which product is really the better deal. Regardless, Soft Soap makes a great anti bacterial hand soap. Personally, I'm more than pleased with the results that I get from this product and I highly recommend the purchase. Other than Dial, they have no other competition out there in the marketplace. At least that seems to be the case for me.",
