It doesn\u2019t dry my skin out but doesn\u2019t feel overly moisturized either. It cleans well, rinses off easily and a little goes a long way. Since it comes in a jug you have to use your own method for dispensing. I actually bought a small dispenser pump that I poured it into and just use a little squirt. It is virtually odorless and I like that because I do not like added ingredients on my skin that it doesn\u2019t need.",
