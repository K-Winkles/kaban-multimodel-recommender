                "reviewText": "It's entirely possible to love a bar of soap and look forward to a long hot bath or shower based on a sensory experience that this soap can give you.I have purchased numorous bars of Pre De Provence soaps and none of them have disappointed me. The rose, mint leaf, sea salt, lime zest, and ocean air being my favorites. Of these the rose and mint leaf are my top two.The lather is fantastic, the scents are just perfect, and they leave my skin soft and not dried out.I traded my normally $20.00 a bottle bath gel for this bar soap and I don't think I will ever return. It's fabulous!",

                "reviewText": "The bar of Pre de Provence soap arrived in a medium sized Amazon bubble pack and the bar was enclosed only in a clear cellophane wrapper. The bar was smashed in on all 8 corners; it wouldn't look good if it was to be given as a gift. I purchased the Milk scent and the bar lathers very well and it\u2019s a creamy lather - I do have soft water. My skin only had a very light smell of the Milk scent after my shower. The Milk scent is hard to describe - a soothing light floral and light baby powder. The 150 gram bar is a good size, a slight bit larger than a bar of soap you'd purchase at the grocery store. To get an idea of the size of this bar most boxes of grocery bar soap have the ounces and grams printed on them.",

                "reviewText": "The bar of soap itself lasts as long as the average soap bar, but the scent doesn't seem to last through the entire lifespan of the bar. That probably has something to do with the fact that it's a more natural option without all the chemicals that the big name store bought soaps have. That being the case, these are great for sensitive skin. The shea butter helps to moisturize really well too.",

                "reviewText": "We got the Pre de Provence \u201cMilk\u201d scented quad-milled bath soap in 150ml. Smells clean, pleasant, and like bursts of nostalgia for washing up before family dinner. Washes clean, rinses cleaner, and our skin seems to enjoy it, too. As our 150g bar will probably become a sliver by the end of the week, we have a 250g of the same variety waiting to take its place.If any people from Pre de Provence are peering at this, please make a shave soap with this scent. I\u2019m told the lathers of the Bergamot and Thyme and the 63 are better than the soaps I currently use, but I\u2019m not interested due to the scents. The milk scent, though, I love it! I\u2019d love to load my brush with this scent for my nightly whisker removal. Please make it happen. Also, my family loves the bath soap as is. Perfect!",
