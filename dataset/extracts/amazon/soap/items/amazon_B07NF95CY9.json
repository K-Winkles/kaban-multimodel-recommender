                "reviewText": "To be helpful to others, here is a review of all 4 bars in this bundle. Keep in mind any scent review is subjective as different people love/dislike different scents:1. Patchouli - amazing scent (can really smell patchouli, but not overpowering). Great/moisturizing on skin. It actually has mint leaves in the bar itself that provide light exfoliation. Grit is very light. NOTE - I know some hate patchouli, so obviously this one is not for those folks2. Bay Rum - 0 scent of anything resembling the scent of \u201cbay rum\u201d. As a matter of fact I can only detect the smell of oil used in this bar, nothing else. It does not smell bad, but if you are seeking a scented bar, this has none of that. It is very nice on skin and is the best moisturizer of all the bars in my opinion. Your skin feels great after shower. 0 grit smooth bar.3. Citrus - same as bay rum, there is 0 scent of anything citrus-related here. Again, I can only smell \u201coil\u201d. It is not as good as bay rum at moisturizing either, so it has nothing good going for it. Light grit.4. Pine tar and charcoal - This one does have a fragrance scent, but it is completely unrelated to pine tar - just smells like perfume. There is very little charcoal in it (which could be good if you don\u2019t want to stain your tub, but not enough for me personally). Light grit.PROS: price (comes to about 4 bucks a bar) and the patchouli bar, which is amazing.CONS: all other bars aside patchouli are bad in my opinionConclusion: I recommend buying just the patchouli bar separately as others are not worth it at all. Again, my subjective 2 cents.",

                "reviewText": "The quality of the product is great, you can definitely notice the rustic look imperfect look that is reminiscent of a home made bar of soap. This is my first bar of soap from this maker and it was the Patchouli, which is described as an earthy musky aroma reminiscent of wet soil. I personally store my soap in a ziplock back in order to prevent the water from hitting it and causing it to dissolve rapidly. Now the first day I used the bar the smell was very mild, however on the second day of use I quickly notice that the scent was very strong, probably around 6 times as much as the first day (something that people with very sensitive noses should beware of) and oh musky it was! I don\u2019t know how to put it but for a minute I thought my dog (who sleeps on my pile of dirty clothes when I shower) had some flatulence, because the scent caught me off guard. But I quickly noticed that as soon as I put the soap back in the ziplock and rinsed off the soap from my body the super strong smell dissipated. Now if you can bear through the strong smell as you shower then you\u2019ll find that the strong smell doesn\u2019t linger much and you\u2019re left with your skin smelling mildly of soil. I personally think that this aroma was not for me but I don\u2019t want to write a negative review as the soap delivered as promised, and the overall quality was outstanding. I definitely look forward to trying other scents as I was really impressed with this brand.",
