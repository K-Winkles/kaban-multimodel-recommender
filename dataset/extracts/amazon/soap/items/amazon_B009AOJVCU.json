                "reviewText": "My skin changed what feels like overnight and I spent the better part of the last 4 years moisturizing, scrubbing, changing soaps. Nothing helped. Bumps and ingrown hairs on my arms, elbows, thighs, knees. One use with this bar and my skin felt amazing and smooth the way it used to. I follow up with shower oil and find I only need to use the bar once a week. It's not messy like traditional scrubs and not a waste of goop stuck on your hands instead of scrubbing your skin.",
