The consistency is creamy and not too watery, but also not too thick to flow through the pump. Using large refillable bottles is more environmentally friendly than constantly buying single use pumps. The smell is great, it cleans well, and leaves your skin feeling moisturized also. All around pleased with this, and a good price.",

                "reviewText": "In my home, the Amazon Basics Liquid Hand Soap has found a special place, specifically in my kitchen and bathroom, where it works harmoniously with my automatic soap dispensers. These clever dispensers are preprogrammed to provide just the right amount of soap, making handwashing a breeze. With this generous 50-fluid ounce pack, I can go for extended periods without worrying about running out of soap. This not only brings me peace of mind but also reduces my trips to the supermarket or Walgreens.What sets this hand soap apart isn't just its practicality; it's also the delightful milk and honey scent that adds a touch of luxury to my daily routine. Every time I wash my hands, I'm treated to a mild, pleasant fragrance that elevates the experience.Regarding the soap's triclosan-free formula, I'll admit that the term was unfamiliar to me before purchasing this product. I decided to dig a bit deeper and discovered that triclosan is an antibacterial and antifungal agent present in some consumer products, including soap. While there's controversy surrounding its effectiveness as an antimicrobial agent, concerns exist about the risk of antimicrobial resistance and its potential impact on hormonal development. Some research also investigates its effects on organisms and environmental health. While I may not fully grasp all the nuances, I do appreciate the growing environmental and safety concerns regarding household products. Knowing that this soap is free from triclosan aligns perfectly with my commitment to safer, eco-friendly choices. It's a small but meaningful step towards a cleaner and greener home.Having used this product for quite some time now, it has become a cornerstone of my kitchen and bathroom. Not only does it keep my hands clean, but it also contributes to a more environmentally responsible household. The Amazon Basics Liquid Hand Soap combines value, a pleasing fragrance of milk & honey, and an eco-conscious approach, making it an ideal addition to my daily routine.",

                "reviewText": "I love this soap. It has a great scent, my hands feel clean when I use it, and I save money. Ever since 2020 I have been trying to build a bit of a storage closet with bulk back up items. I have reusable soap dispensers that I've just been topping off with this. Its 50 oz for like $5 and in one container instead of 10. I feel less wasteful getting this.",
