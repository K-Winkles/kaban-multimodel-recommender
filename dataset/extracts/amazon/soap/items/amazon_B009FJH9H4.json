                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Does NOT bother my allergies or dry out my skin and works. However, not much suds, and only mostly scent-free.",
                "reviewText": "This is a mixed review but overall it gets 5-stars because after buying many different brands and types of similar soaps, I can't find anything better that meets all my primary criteria, thus reasons I'm giving it 5-stars are as follows:- It did not bother my allergies at all whatsoever,- It does not have perfume of any type listed or that I can smell,- It only has 5 natural ingredients vs other brands with a long list of weird stuff,- It actually works and gets you clean,- It does not dry out my skin probably because 1 of its 5 ingredients is vegetable oil believe it or not (and no, it does NOT feel oily at all whatsoever).Okay now the not-so-great part of my \"mixed\" review:- This Unscented version is not 100% truly scent-free, but its 99%. I'm guessing this is because either the glycerine itself or one of its other 4 ingredients has a slight normal/natural smell, but it's very subtle and quickly fades away.- This Clearly Natural glycerine soap does not produce much suds or lather, but that didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. However IF this was a shampoo, the lack of lathering would probably bother me a lot.As an aside, Yes I tried several other variations of the Clearly Natural glycerine soaps, THIS Unscented is obviously what they're known for and is their best soap: Their Aloe Vera and Vitamin-E versions have more ingredients and too strong of an odd/weird odor.Overall if you have sensitive skin and bad allergies like me you should consider it, and I'm glad I gave this a try.",

                "reviewText": "I've bought two lots of these so far and shall be getting more because they are, by far, the best soaps I've ever used. For years, I'd had a really bad skin condition on my hands til I started using these and it has cleared up!I noted some people's complaints of this soap that it has no lather. Well, it does - but as I've said before in other reviews - soaps tend to lather better in soft-water areas. A glycerine soap without a foaming agent, such as this, will produce little to no lather in a hard-water area. I'm in a soft-water area so the amount of lather this produces is fine for me. Also, because it hasn't a huge amount of lather, it washes off very quickly.What you do have to be aware of, though, is that like other glycerine soaps, this needs to be kept as dry as possible in between using it, so if you can, put it in a soap dish with drainer slats. Otherwise, what happens is that it will eventually absorb moisture and go cloudy and will begin to fall apart (this is common to all glycerine soaps).Edit, on 17th November 2019. I'd love to buy more of this soap from Amazon but the price has gone up and right at the moment it's not what I'm willing to pay. Maybe again in the future as I still love the soap.",
