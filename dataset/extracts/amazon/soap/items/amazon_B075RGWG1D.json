To be fair, it is great soap and I love how it smells, and it works extremely well doing what it was designed to do, which is clean stinky dirty bodies. And I will definitely use this case and when it runs out (if that happens in my lifetime), I\u2019ll definitely buy more.

Hated it and I donated it to a shelter in my town. My daughter found the original on eBay, much more expensive, but she bought it for her dad and it is the ORIGINAL.
