Cleanses the hands, doesn\u2019t make the skin dry, and it has a nice subtle smell. I\u2019m pregnant, so I\u2019m a bit sensitive to all smells right now, but this one is pretty nice and the fact that the scent isn\u2019t too strong is a plus. It\u2019s also the middle of winter in NYC, which means hands tend to get drier and drier due to lack of moisture and frequent hand washing. I have yet to experience dryness from this soap.",

The problem is I need to use twice as much or more than the brand name I was using. This hand soap doesn\u2019t provide much lather at all. With one pump the soap amounts to little lather. I need to use extra soap to feel like my hands are cleansed. The price is great but this is a low quality hand soap I won\u2019t purchase again. I don\u2019t recommend.",
