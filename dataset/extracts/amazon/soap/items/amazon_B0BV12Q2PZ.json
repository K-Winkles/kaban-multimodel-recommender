The floral fragrance is not overpowering, but rather evokes a sense of gentle elegance. I particularly appreciate how gentle this hand soap is on my skin, as I have found that some hand soaps can be quite drying. Dove Advanced Care Hand Wash Peony & Rose Oil, on the other hand, leaves my hands feeling supple and nourished, even after multiple washes.I wholeheartedly recommend this hand soap to anyone seeking a gentle and effective product that pampers their hands with a touch of floral grace. It's a true pleasure to use, and it has become an essential part of my daily routine.",

                "reviewText": "As some others have mentioned, the tops were not secured tight enough before the item was packed and shipped. When it arrived, I opened the package and noticed the product had already leaked in the box. At the time, the scent was very strong and I thought the scent may be too overpowering. Amazon was able to provide good support regarding my concern with the product leaking. After using what was left of the product, I did not think the scent was too strong. Perhaps the strong scent was only an issue because it had spilled out in the box and was not used with water as I would when I am washing my hands. The soap lathers well and does not dry out my skin as much, which is not the case for some soaps. This particular soap lathers well with just 1 pump of product. Being that the price of everything has risen, so has my standards. With that being said, it is very problematic when product spills out because I am not getting what I paid for. I hope the seller is taking note of the reviews that mention the same issue and makes changes to ensure the tops are screwed on tightly so that customers are getting what they paid for. I do like the soap, but I will probably try to find another seller so that I do not run into this issue again. I would have continued to purchase otherwise, but will have to switch to another seller until the issue is resolved.",

Lately all I can find is Lavender (way too potent), and vanilla.They evidently Dove is changing what they offer. Gone are the Foams unless you buy refillable bottles, and the fragrances are not very feminine.Even though this is not a foaming hand soap, the smell sounded intriguing, so I decided to give it a try. I love it! It has a delicate aroma that reminds me of the Pink Lotus. I will definitely buy more of this if Dove continues to offer it! I would highly recommend it if you like a delicate, pleasant smell when washing your hands.",

Dish soap strips away the natural oils, which in a day or 2 can really dry out your hands. I ordered the 4-pack & have 1 each on the bathroom, kitchen, & soak tub sinks. The 4th is so I don't run out! If you use this hand soap for a week, instead of dipping into the dish lotion, you'll see a big difference in the skin on your hands. It won't feel a size too small & the cracks & dryness in your skin will start clearing up. Plus, it SMELLS great I have mild dermatitis on my hands &, if the product doesn't work, I don't by it again. This item has a home with me.",
