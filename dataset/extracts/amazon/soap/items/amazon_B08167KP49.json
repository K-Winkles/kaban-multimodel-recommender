I love that the viscosity is thick so it feels like a good quality soap. I even add some water if putting into a decorative dispenser to thin just a bit and it goes farther without feeling watery. I plan to keep this on my subscription list for my go-to hand soap. It's also good to use it to bathe my dog since I know it's a pure product and her skin doesn't get irritated or dry.",

Mine looks like a gel upon dispensing into hand, and doesn't really seem to foam up?Or am I just having yet another senior moment? I do have poor vision, but this doesn't seem foamy to me.I would still highly recommend the product, I normally would not pay this much for hand soaps , but they do also offer2--32 oz. Refill bottles for a very good price. Here on amazon, so you can refill your bottles and continue using the lovely lavender soap. I am also impressed with the natural oils that they put in here, that stuff is really good for my skin.Update a day later to my review. The company says they have not made a foam in years, yet the description says foam. It would appear that they did not know this, (I know, I was surprised as well),so they are looking into this.",

                "reviewText": "This has been one of my favorite hand soaps for a long time. I love the aesthetics of the bottle design, the lather is just enough, but the best part is the scent. So many lavender products are dolled up and end up smelling too feminine. This one is just a nice pure lavender, strong but not too strong, that works well in a bathroom for any gender. This will probably just stay on rotation at my house. Would have preferred not having to buy a three pack, but all is well. Ended up taking one of the bottles to work. Anyway, if you\u2019re a lavender fan, definitely recommend this.",
