It's all gone! My neck and body feel like they have been replaced; they are spotless. Soft and smooth to the touch.- I LOVE Oud. I saw reviews of this strong soap bar, but it isn't. It smells weird, yet pleasant to me (like a soothing, relaxing scent). It's like a hotel bar of soap but doesn't give you a headache afterward \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0fFirst bar is pretty good so far for a blind buy.",

                "reviewText": "Here's my situation in a nutshell: I'm a hockey goalie and regular soap isn't good enough after playing. Does this remove all forms of stink? Yes. Does this soap leave you smelling \"good\" after you get out of the shower? A little bit - does seem to fade pretty quickly. (And I'm not sure I'd say it smells \"woodsy\", more flowery/fieldy.) Does this feel like you're showing with 80 grit sandpaper? Ohhhhhh yeah. I'm not a delicate person and I wouldn't say my skin is sensitive, but this soap is a bit intense for my liking. It does what it's supposed to do, but it's unpleasant to use on like your arms and legs. This would be great for hands after painting or using grease, but not as a body soap. Going to move this from the shower to the slop sink for when I'm done in the garage.Update: So I gave this a few more go rounds in the shower and I'm a convert. I love this. It did take some time to get used to it, but this is now my go to for the shower. Again, it is super intense when you first use it so I probably wouldn't suggest this as your first step into exfoliating soap, but if you're used to rougher exfoliating soaps, give it a whirl.",

It doesn\u2019t leave the body feeling oily and doesn\u2019t dry out skin either which is good! The only complaint I have is how long the bar lasts compared to its price. I\u2019m pretty sure this bar is an American product, but the bar only lasts maybe a month? Probably less depending how much one showers. I shower every day during the week since I am a welder and need to. Continuous use like this, it lasted just about a month. It would be nice if it either lasted longer (a thicker bar) or perhaps they added a second bar considering its high price point. I would recommend it for the scent and clean skin feeling, however the price is steep for the length of use you get out of the bar.",
