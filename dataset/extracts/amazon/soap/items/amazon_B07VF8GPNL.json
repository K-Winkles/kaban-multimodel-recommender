                "reviewText": "I didn't have high hopes for this one, but I was pleasantly surprised.- The bar is larger, which is good because it doesn't have great longevity, but it certainly doesn't melt entirely after only a week or two like some of the competition. That was a surprising plus.- The scent was okay, nothing great in my opinion but I did get some compliments. I guess it just didn't feel like it had a unique scent to it and was a bit chemical-ly. But others liked it so... different strokes, I suppose. Also, the scent does stick to the body well and the fragrance is present throughout the bar, not just sprayed on the outside and that's it.- This being a moisturizing soap, I did feel my skin was getting a nice refresh. Not the best I've had, but certainly better than plenty of others. I don't have particularly dry skin, so those who do have that skin issue may have different opinions, but for me it was adequate.I guess there are 2 negatives, though neither has to do with the soap itself...- I do hate the name. \"man bar\". Wish the company would just do something like, \"SF SoCo\". Man bar just sounds really silly. I wouldn't get this as a gift for someone on that basis alone because it's that silly of a name to me. It's trying to market how some competitors do and it comes off tacky. \"No, it's not a loaf of bread, this is for manly men, so we'll call it a man loaf!\"...get it? Just unnecessary.- The packaging. While it's nice, don't get me wrong, (it has a magnetically closing box which is pretty cool...although made in china) it's really unnecessary. Let me put it this way... when you open a package of soap and use it, do you keep the packaging for any reason? I sure don't and I've never seen anyone else do that. I certainly don't put the soap back into the packaging after I've used it, yet that seems like the point of the box being so elaborate, and yet it's not... it's just for packaging. I don't get it. I only bring this up because I do feel if they simplified the packaging, they could reduce their price even more to be more competitive and the product wouldn't suffer at all.Overall- Not 'the best' soap I've used, but for the price, it's not too bad and was pleasantly surprising in a couple aspects.",
