Definitely does but more than that, I was constantly frustrated with the filmly residue it left everywhere it touched on my vanity. If it's not wiped up immediately, it hardens and is difficult to remove.So I very happily trusted reviewers that said there was no such film with Dr. Woods brand in the pretty bottle.To my delight, It's true! There is no film! I'm finally free!It does seem to need to have it's nose wiped occasionally (it gathers around the pump nozzle), but that I can handle.It also cleans every bit as good as the other brand. I recommend.",

Love that it\u2019s super mild, thick like regular soap, and nothing bad is in it! (According to Environmental Working Group - EWG - SkinDeep database, which I just discovered.) Even though I don\u2019t love the scent while I\u2019m washing them, my little ones smell pleasantly clean afterwards. The price is great compared to other Castile soaps. I\u2019m planning to use it for myself as well and replace our liquid hand soap with this.",
