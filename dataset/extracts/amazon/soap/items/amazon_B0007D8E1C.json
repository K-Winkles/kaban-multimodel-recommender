                "reviewText": "The Dove Skin Care Beauty Bar in Cucumber and Green Tea is my absolute favorite, and I can\u2019t say enough good things about it. This pack of 8 bars is not just a beauty bar; it\u2019s a refreshing treat for my skin.The scent of cucumber and green tea is simply divine. It\u2019s not overpowering but leaves a subtle, clean, and fresh fragrance on my skin that I adore. Every shower with this bar feels like a spa-like experience.What I appreciate the most is how gentle it is on the skin. Unlike regular bar soaps that can leave your skin feeling dry and tight, Dove\u2019s beauty bar is incredibly moisturizing. It doesn\u2019t strip away natural oils and leaves my skin feeling soft and supple after each use.The 3.75 oz bars last quite a while, making this pack a great value for the quality and benefits it provides. It\u2019s become a staple in my daily skincare routine, and I wouldn\u2019t want to be without it.In summary, the Dove Skin Care Beauty Bar in Cucumber and Green Tea is a true gem. It combines my favorite scent with gentle, moisturizing properties, leaving my skin feeling pampered and refreshed. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a soap that cares for their skin.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely LOVE this Dove cool moisture cucumber beauty bar! I used to use Olay, and I still like those too, but I felt like changing thing's up and had heard good things about Dove. We started with the White bars, and then the pink coconut milk bars, and really liked both of them, so I thought why not try even more. Well...I'm so glad I did because I think this one is my favorite! I love how fresh and cool it smells and feels. I think they all work the same, but this green bar's fragrance just really makes me feel extra clean and fresh, which I think is what most of us are looking for after a shower. I like the shape of the bar too, because it fits perfectly in your palm while washing and doesn't slip away easily when going over an uneven body part. I will say that this fragrance is a little stronger than the white bars, and a little more than the pink coconut bars, so for those who are sensitive to fragrances or are looking for a fragrance free bar for any reason, I would recommend the white bar over this green, and probably over the pink, as well. The white has the least fragrance of the 3 in my opinion, although it does still have a fresh smell. I personally am not sensitive to fragrances, so maybe that's why I was so excited about this particular bar. I like it so much that I literally just purchased a 4 pack of the deodorant to match. Finger's crossed I like them since I went all out and got 4! Lol...These bars really feel great for your skin. My skin never feels tight and overly dry with these Dove bars like a lot of regular bar soaps do. I used to hate bar soaps growing up because of that feeling, and turned to body wash for years as an adult. After meeting my husband, and gaining weight and health problems after my second pregnancy and always feeling hot and sweaty, I didn't feel like body wash on a loofah was enough, at least not the small amount that used to suffice. He used bar soap, so I dredgingly gave it a try after swearing against it. Surprisingly I did feel cleaner, but again, I had that icky dry feeling. I researched and found Olay at the time, which is what I have been using since my daughter was born 9yrs ago. That is until about 9mnths ago when we first switched to Dove.These are called beauty bars because they're made mostly of moisturizers, rather than \"soap.\" That's why your skin feels clean AND SOFT after washing. If you still feel like you need a \"soap\" to get fully clean, I recommend keeping one of these in the shower to use after scrubbing with the soap bar, because this will help to remoisturize your skin and prevent that icky dry and weird tight feeling when using only bar soap. That will help make these last even longer too, but of course will cost you to keep both on hand. Of course, those soap bars are usually cheaper, so it will even out some. Olay is honestly just as good, and is also considered a beauty bar, but unfortunately it's harder to find them in these bigger ounce bars, so we will probably stick to Dove for awhile. Dove bars do seem to get used up a little faster, but we're enjoying the change for now, especially if we can continue finding them at a good value on here using the subscribe and save. I recommend you giving Dove a try if you want to feel clean while still leaving your skin feeling smooth when you step out of the shower. My whole family of 4 really likes all 3 of the ones we've used, and it's usually hard to please everyone in my household. I hope my experience and my pictures help give you an idea of what to expect in person.",
