Plus the Meyer's soaps had an odd scent that was too strong.We also tried JR Watkins which on sale costs less, but it has ingredients that are questionable.The ingredients in Cleancult are much safer than most liquid soaps. The Lemon Verbena has a very nice, natural lemon smell.The consistency is fine - not to thin or too thick - and it works fine in all of our hand soap dispensers.It lathers well and cleans as well as any other liquid soap we tried.",

                "reviewText": "I enjoy using this soap because it smells great! I have very dry skin and being a former nurse, I know the importance of washing my hands thoroughly numerous times a day. Most soaps leave my hands dry and irritated. I found this soap to be mild enough that it does not irritate my skin and cleans my hands. I wash for the recommended 20 seconds every time, so it\u2019s important that I not damage my skin in the process. I actually bought this product the first time because of the packaging. I was trying to find alternatives to plastic. Fortunately I have found the soap to be an excellent product. I will continue to order this soap.",
