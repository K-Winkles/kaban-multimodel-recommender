Easy to wash with, no strong odor, feels slick while washing but leaves no detectable residue. Once dried, my skin feels completely free of everything but the skin itself. I haven't experienced any excessive dryness (but I also use a moisturizer on my face after I wash). All in all an effective, inexpensive, seemingly well made bar. Thus far I'm pleased with this company's products. I'll keep buying.",
