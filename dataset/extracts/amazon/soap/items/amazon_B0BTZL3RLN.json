I alternate between the soap & the body wash in the same line (as I've always done with Dove sensitive skin bar soaps & body wash). I would recommend the Dove body love eczema-prone bar soap. I can't use skin care products that have fragrance so this unscented soap works great for me.",

This soap has no smell at all if that\u2019s what you need. the soap lathers great and makes you feel clean and less irritated. Hope this will help someone definitely recommend.Overall- no smell for sensitive sniffers, and helps with your skin.",
