                "reviewText": "I don't know what I was fully expecting with this soap, but I believe it's fulfilled my expectations. I've been using this soap for a little over two weeks now, and I can honestly say I notice such a difference in my skin. The texture of my skin is now smoother in many areas in which I had dryness (parts of my legs, my feet, parts of my arms, a dry area on my back), and even after rinsing, I can feel the moisturizing nature of this soap. Now, considering another reviewer had said that this soap left their skin a bit dried out, I figured I should expect that, which wasn't a huge deal because I have used plenty of drying soaps before, such as Nubian Heritage's own Lemongrass and Tea Tree oil soap. That's a super drying soap right there. But I don't find that drying property to be true for this Indian Hemp soap.The smell is fantastic. It's a light, airy scent. Very fresh and clean. A tiny bit on the floral side, not much. And as much as I would honestly love for the scent to linger on and on, it really doesn't. So if you're not fond of lingering soap scents, this is good. Once I'm done my shower and dry off, it's not as strong anymore. The soap itself has little scrubbies in it. I use a wash cloth, so I don't really notice them, but if you're using this bar directly, you'll definitely feel them. It doesn't have a super rich lather, but I will say that the lather it does create lasts until I rinse out my rag.Overall, I'd recommend this soap. It's been such a treat to my skin, and I'm so glad I spent the few bucks (not the 6-something it sells for now) on this. It's also helped out tremendously with various bug bites on my legs and arms. I suppose I can credit that to the anti-inflammatory property. It's left my skin much softer and smoother, and I'm pleased with the results of using this.",
