The only thing I would recommend is that they ship it in sturdier packaging (more padding) as even though it was in shrink wrap one of the bottles had leaked a little and dripped down the bottle and underneath the bottle. I cleaned it up before I gave it to her. My positive recommendation is that things like this need to be shipped in strong boxes with plenty of padding.",
