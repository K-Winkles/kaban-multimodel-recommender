                "reviewText": "Old Review: I've been looking for a soap to replace the last bar I have from my trip to France many years ago. It's an exfoliating, hard soap. One bar lasts me months. I saw these soaps and thought they looked similar. I bought one just to try it out. I'm so disappointed. This soap is so soft. It practically melts before your eyes when water hits it. It may last a week or two. Also ... it's supposed to be exfoliating, but you could have fooled me. Yes, it smells nice, I'm sure it's nice on sensitive skin, and it's moisturizing. I just wasn't looking for that. Back to the drawing board.12/30/21. I'm re-writing my review after using this soap for a while. I apologize for that bad review. This is the soap I was looking for. I saw some reviews saying it's a knock-off. I don't think so. The other bar I had was from France because I was in France when I bought it, from a soap factory. This soap is just like that other bar of soap. It exfoliates well, foams up well, has a nice scent and has staying power. This is just what I wanted and I strongly recommend it. I will buy more. Incidentally, this bar is smaller than the one I had before. The other bar was too big and hard to hold. This one is just the right size.",

                "reviewText": "This is for the sea salt soap. I didn't know what to expect, it has a faint sea scent that could also be a mild floral so I'm guessing there's some pleasant unidentified flower contributing to the scent. I love it. It does not smell up the upstairs, this one is milder than the Linden, which scented the upstairs for a month or so, which I also enjoyed. This one you smell it when you use it and it does smell mild and with a sea impression just what I was looking for. Nothing perfumy, very natural spa like and light scent. Sometimes you're in the mood for one thing, sometimes another. This is clean.",

Just in a bag, with no bubble wrap or cushioning of any kind. Mine looked fine in the package, but when I opened it, one corner was smashed in.The scent. The soap itself smells heavenly! I put mine at the bathroom sink for hand-washing. While washing your hands, the soap feels soft and you get a mild aroma of gardenia. But once you dry your hands, the aroma and softness are gone.Will never re-order.",
