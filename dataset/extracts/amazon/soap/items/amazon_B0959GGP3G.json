Dove Men+Care understands the importance of having a simple daily routine for caring for your skin. This Dove Clean Comfort Body and Face Bar is noncomedogenic and can be used across your whole body to gently clean skin and is even mild enough for use on your face.

The smell is not like a perfume but like some type a powder. Like a baby powder. This soap does the work to keep you clean and also keeps your body so soft. This soap also can last. This soap is not easy to find it seems and it seems to be more expensive. That lets me know that people prefer this one more.I recommend using it with cold showers.\ud83e\udd76Skin defenseThe orange soap is my second favorite.It also lathers but not much as the blue one. It has a tiny bit smell of perfume. I describe it like a lotion with just a tad of perfume. It is not a bad smell. It keeps your body smooth too. It does not last as the blue one but last more than the green one. This soap was easy to find.Extra freshThe green one has a strong perfume. Smells stronger than the others. It's a really good smell also. I found this soap not last at all. It was easy to find.So, I was looking for a soap that would last, smell good, clean, and moisturize your skin. The blue one does all of that for me.",

                "reviewText": "I use a lot of Dove Men products, including their body washes. My wife came to me a few months ago because she is very concerned about plastics and our apparent inability to actually recycle them even though the symbol is there. We're phasing out as much plastic in our household goods as possible, so my body wash had to go!I originally switched to body wash because typical bar soap never felt like it did the job, and the scruntchy thingy always left my skin feeling nice. I expected to do some research and find that some over-priced appothecary company with a bearded dude as a logo was going to be all the rage. I was actually surprised to find that Dove Men reviewed quite well so I gave it a try.After a few weeks, I can report that I am happy with the experience. The soap works well both as a body and face wash, and my skin feels clean and not itchy. My wife's starting to balk a bit on getting rid of some of her favorite products, but I'm at least happy at this one.",
