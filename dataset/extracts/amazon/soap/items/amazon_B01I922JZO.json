                "reviewText": "If there\u2019s one thing that I\u2019d like you to remember after reading this review, it\u2019s this: You will see many companies use the label \u201call-natural soap,\u201d but few are TRULY all-natural. To me, this means the following:\u2022 No additives.\u2022 No hidden fragrances.\u2022 No micas.\u2022 No colorants.\u2022 No preservatives.\u2022 No chemicals.Therefore, be kind to yourself and read the ingredients before you buy a soap, and make sure that it meets YOUR definition of all-natural.I investigated Soap Haven and its products extensively, and rest assured: Soap Haven\u2019s soaps are truly ALL-NATURAL. Here are the ingredients of the Patchouli soap: Saponified Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Organic Palm Oil, Shea Butter, Patchouli Essential Oil, Kaolin Clay, and Iron Oxide. You will note that these ingredients don\u2019t include any of the undesirable ingredients that I listed above. Just pure goodness!Here are some of the benefits of patchouli:\u2022 Reducing inflammation\u2022 Healing cracked, dry skin\u2022 Helping with common skin problems (e.g., acne, eczema)\u2022 Calming and centering the nervesIf you\u2019ve never heard of Patchouli, let me warn you that people either LOVE or HATE the smell. Obviously, I liked it, or I wouldn\u2019t be recommending it! However, beware that people have very strong reactions to this scent: they either fall in love with it, or they never want to have anything to do with it ever again! Those that like it describe it as follows: earthy, musky, sweet, spicy, and woodsy. The best way to describe it is to imagine walking through the woods in the fall after a good rain; the smell of the air in the woods is somewhat akin to patchouli. On the other hand, those that hate it describe it as a dank, damp, rotten smell. I find it most amusing that people can have such opposite reactions to the same smell! Read the reviews on Amazon, and you\u2019ll see what I mean!Of the Patchouli soaps that I\u2019ve tried, this is the purest one. The scent of patchouli is strong and hasn\u2019t been watered down by combining it with other flavors.Soap Haven produces soap with heart, and they are one of the few companies that are truly and honestly 100% ALL-NATURAL, so go ahead and try all their flavors with confidence!",
