                "reviewText": "Based on the scent alone, this bar soap is one of the best. I was in search of a Harry\u2019s brand bar soap, but like the cleaning sprays of the Meyer\u2019s brand so I figured it try it out. It last good amount of time considering I used it every day. As a woman, I really enjoy subtle cologne scents that smell masculine yet clean and refreshing. This is the one.",

                "reviewText": "Perfect for the kitchen this soap lathers quickly, cleans dirty hands effectively and most importantly won't dry them out when you wash them again and again.The photo shows the size and condition of the bar after more than three months of daily use with artificially softened water. I'm chef, housekeeper and repair tech for everything in the home and make significant use of the soap carefully selected for this location. I even made rather extraordinary use of the bar for a few days while working with graphite--extraordinarily sticky stuff that does not remove easily. It's excellent hard, long-lasting nearly ideal \"hand soap.\"This is my first experience with this brand of a stash of a brand no longer made ran dry. While it does not feel as hard and dense as the previous which could last for months it is certainly was I consider to be a \"hard\" bar of soap that can be expected not to turn into mush in the soap dish and last for a good period of time.I chose \"rainwater\" or similar scent as I wanted something fairly neutral. That's what I got.I have been using this nearly arrived bar very frequently as I'm working with things that dirty my hands quickly with difficult to remove things like graphite and polish residue yet I nonetheless must keep things scrupulously clean requiring very frequent handwashing.Again, this is an excellent hand soap perfect for the kitchen sink. I wouldn't expect it to work for auto mechanic work dirty hands and have other things around for that--at least the first washing.",
