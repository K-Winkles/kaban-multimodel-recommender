It doesn't smell like fruit or other weird mango, coconut, sagebrush combos you find these days. use to clean hands before inserting contact lenses and have had no issue of soap residue on hands (causing eyes to burn).It works as a everyday housetop keeping hands clean.Very light moisturizing.Cons:The smell is strong at first, but it does go away.It's not a soap for seriously dirty hands. It struggles a bit to get grease and heavy residue of your hands.Still a little drying, but not overly so.",
