This is good quality natural soap that gets you squeaky clean without all those bad chemicals.Unfortunately this brand didn't have an unscented option, so the only scent that doesn't make me smell too unmanly is the Patchouli Rose. The scent is quite strong, but not overpowering, so I'm happy with it.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this soap to save money and have soap constantly available without having to buy a new soap every week. I use a little of this diluted with water, and lately I have been adding essential oils to it as well for variety. Clove oil is a lovely addition to the orange, and also frankincense and myrhh is fun! The soap is lovely in a foaming soap dispenser, and it can be diluted very heavily (I use only a couple of tablespoons in an 8-oz dispenser), so it is economical. But best of all, the first winter I had this soap was the first time I ever got through a whole winter with no cracked hands! I am thrilled! Castile soap seems to much healthier than others, and this one is a lovely scent and a nice bargain size. Very pleased.",

                "reviewText": "Very thin - this is already diluted - you wouldn't want to dilute it any further - that's the reason for the lost star. But the scent is very lovely on the skin. It does smell a little weird while you're washing with it, but the scent it leaves is heavenly. I feel it's a little too pricey for how thin it was - if it was like most other castile soaps that I've used and a bit thicker in viscosity/strength, it would be a 5 star product. But if you like the scents of both patchouli and rose, this really does shine in this product. I know some folks have said it's hard to smell the rose - it is a bit hard to detect it during washing, but again, where this one shines is the scent it leaves behind, and you can very definitely smell a perfect blend of rose and patchouli once you're done washing. Note: I've only used it for hand washing and as a bodywash, and it's perfect for that even if it's a bit thin.",
