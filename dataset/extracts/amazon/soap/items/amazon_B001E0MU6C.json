The soap cleans well with no harshness whatsoever. I even take it with me when I travel.",

                "reviewText": "You really do have to have patience with this soap. Other puppps sufferers I\u2019ve noted in reviews have time to bathe 3-4 times a day which I do not. I work normal 8-9 hours a day. Have 2 small kids to take care of. I can get a shower in 1-2 a day. I developed puppps after starting a daily slowfe iron supplement to treat anemia while pregnant at 31 weeks pregnant. The first week started as no more than a few itchy hives on my belly. I had no idea it would turn into 100s of hives within a week. Once I was already at the point of being overcome with hives, I bought this stuff as well as set Dr. Appointments. In a time, where monkeypox is regularly mentioned in the news, seeing that many hives is scary.To the point, the soap does smell like a campfire, the first 4 days it made my skin burn. I had a lot of open sores from scratching and rubbing the hives. By day 4 I was ready to give the soap up because other reviews were saying their puppps were COMPLETELY RESOLVED. And mine were and still very much as at the time of this post - still there. This is an unrealistic expectation. The soap does NOT resolve puppps. It does not cure puppps. You will still have puppps until the baby is born! However, it DOES cleanse the skin in a way that encourages the hives to dry up and scabs to crust over. The skin will start to peel on each and every individual hive. THEY WILL STILL ITCH. The scars from those hives will also remain. Applying this soap, is still rubbing your inflamed, irritated skin. It will also spread the hives while cleansing the skin. I\u2019ve noticed the places on my back where I can\u2019t reach - those hives are still hives in individual places where places I have scrubbed with the soap - there doesn\u2019t appear to be any spaces anymore of skin that\u2019s not affected. Majority of my hives have lost their swollen \u201craised\u201d look. The scars are still very much there and unsightly. I still itch like no other. To combat itching. I coat my skin in 100% virgin coconut oil several times a day as necessary as I need to whenever I feel the itching coming back. This is the only remedy I have found for itching after trying several others specifically for itching. The soap has not resolved itching for me. Only cleaning, drying up the hives, and helping the skin peel the scabs. I\u2019m 33 weeks now. Still a long road to birth in terms of itching for another month or 2. I hope this helps someone not have such a hard time.",

                "reviewText": "Imagine you are walking through the woods and you are surrounded by pines, tall and majestic. You decide to warm yourself with a fire. The odor that surrounds you is packaged into this bar of soap!With that little fantasy in mind, imagine you are unwrapping your first box of Grandpa Soap Pine Tar and taking your first whiff. The experience is beard growing. The soap has a very strong scent and it will instantly increase your masculinity. If you are imagining something like pine scent, this isn't it. It will likely remind you more of a Clint Eastwood western.My wife is weakened in the knees when I step out of the shower smelling of trees and campfire.The soap itself is quality unsurpassed, and the scent doesn't linger on you when you rinse off. I also find it's effective for dry or irritated skin, and any other skin. I believe it helps with acne and really does amazing job of removing oils and dirt from your body. Grandpa's soap may cause some side effects like a strong desire to buy flannel or chop down a tree.. Other than that, well,it's soap. Pretty good soap at that.",

                "reviewText": "I have super dry skin and had been using a moisturizing body wash that did not help\u2026Found a little sample bar and a 4.25 oz bar that I must have bought years ago and gave it a go, my skin LOVES IT, no more flakey dry skin, the smell was there but faint and it was gone from skin after showering (no lingering smell on your skin).Boy, new bars arrived and they are strong! So, I removed from plastic, they are airing outside to mellow. The smell is a woodsy mixed with campfire or wood stove but again the smell does not stay with you and the tradeoff for my skin is 100% well worth it and yes, I even use on my face. Though I would prefer unscented, this is the best \ud83d\ude0a",
