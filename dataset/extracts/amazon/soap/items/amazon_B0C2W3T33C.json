                "reviewText": "I have been using dove beauty bars for the last couple of months after going my entire life not having ever used them or tried them. Not to sound dramatic but I mean it when I say I feel like I won the lottery and I\u2019m never switching to another soap lol. For my entire life, I was under the (way wrong) impression that all bar soap was like dial bar soap-drying and harsh. So as a person with very very sensitive, dry, flaky, coarse/rough skin, I had never even considered trying these. My husband has always used dove bars, and in an attempt to start spending less on body/bath products, I randomly decided to try one. Much to my shock, my skin did not disintegrate. AND right away, I noticed during that few minutes after showering/drying off but before applying lotion, my skin felt cleaner and way less tight/dry/itchy compared to usual. On top of that, after a few uses my skin just looked less angry, and it is completely clear of irritation bumps and patches of dryness. I\u2019ve tried just about every single body wash out there and the dove beauty bars are so much better than anything I\u2019ve used, including my former go-to aveeno body wash that I couldn\u2019t live without. Come to find out dove beauty bars are actually the #1 derm recommended body soap lol (I know, I\u2019m late). I just feel so silly that I\u2019ve been making body soap so complicated up until now. This stuff is great, my skin has never felt better, and we now use the dove bars on our 8 month old son as well.Some reviews are saying that these bars are smaller than store bought dove bars\u2026. And\u2026. If you read what you\u2019re buying, you\u2019ll see that yes, it will be slightly smaller. The product is cadvertised as the 3.17 size which is smaller than 3.75 lol. They aren\u2019t being sneaky sending smaller bars- that size is the size you are purchasing.This variety pack was so fun to smell. These scents/varieties are all awesome in my opinion. Some are sweeter smelling than others but all smell clean, and none of them are crazy overpowering (dove beauty bars in general never seem to be OVERLY fragrant).The soap boxes and soaps themselves arrived in a shipping bag, not a box, but the entire product was perfectly intact and had not sustained any damage during shipping.These will last me for quite a while and I cant wait to try them all! This was a 10/10 purchase and I\u2019m already looking for another variety pack to buy so I can just try every single one of them. Definitely buy them if you\u2019re thinking about it!!!!!",
