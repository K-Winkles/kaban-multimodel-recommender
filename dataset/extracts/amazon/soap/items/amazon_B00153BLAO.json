Other natural/organic soaps that I have used seem to dissolve before your very eyes, but this bar is truly hard milled and comes is a lovely cardboard box as pictured. However, let's not forget how moisturizing this product is, and the mandarin choice is a very delicate, yet exotic, orange scent. And lastly--but not leastwise by any stretch of the imagination--this hard milled soap is a bargain considering its longevity; and, as my dearly deceased father would advise: \"Pay now, or pay later,\" and \"You get what you pay for\".... Thank you, and well done!",

I took a bar out and set it in my shower and a few hours later I went into the bathroom and thought \u201cwhat\u2019s that smell?\u201c and then I realized, that I was smelling the lavender from the soap! It was wonderful to be able to smell the soap as if I had sprayed air freshener in the bathroom. It has a rich, deep lavender scent that smells like you\u2019re in a lavender hot house and this was just the dry soap sitting on the soap dish in the shower.2. When I use the soap in my shower it was so soft and luxurious feeling that it was just fabulous! It lathers up so rich and creamy that it just feels very indulgent! A full 24 hours later, I was still able to smell, though faintly, the scent of lavender on my skin. It left my skin feeling soft and smooth, too.3. Also, being a vegan for over 15 years, I am so pleased that it\u2019s also vegan!This will be my bar soap going forward! I highly recommend this soap if you like the scent of lavender. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf31",

Reviews had said it was very light and they are quite right. The soap moisturizes and has a very pleasant faint orange scent that I really like. I will be purchasing this soap again.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a soap maker with no time at present. Most \"olive oil soap\" is actually pomace soap. Pomace is the remnant oil left in crushed olives. Nothing really wrong with it except that it is much cheaper to make. True castile soap is made of high quality, 100% liquid olive oil. The soap is creamy, almost white, and nothing is kinder to skin. It may not lather as much as other blends but it cleans just as well. It works as a shampoo bar, face and body bar. It's simply the best. A slight green, translucent bar is mostly olive oil with a small amount of pomace. A dark green or brownish green, with a slight odor is a pomace bar. If you care, this the absolute best. The only thing better is a home made bar like this that is a super fatted bar which a commercial bar is not.",
