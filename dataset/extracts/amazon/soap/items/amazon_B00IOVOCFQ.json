I tried using it and I absolutely love it. The smell is exactly like toasted coconut and I love the fact that it doesn\u2019t leave that horrible soap film on my skin where it feels super dry. This is very moisturizing and left my skin feel extremely soft. I wish the scent lasted a little bit longer, but this will definitely be a repurchase.",

I had a few patches of sore dry skin on the top of my arms, have done for many years, the doctor gave me steroid cream for it and I was using cerave on a daily basis, neither got rid of the problem but this soap has 99% cleared it up in a short amount of time, can't believe it \u2764 it could smell nicer but to be honest I don't care due to the above, leaves you soft and feeling squeaky clean",
