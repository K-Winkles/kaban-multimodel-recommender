                "reviewText": "I am new to natural soaps this year. What got my attention first was the price. It is around the average price for a 6 pack. As some people know, cheap may be cheap and expensive may just be expensive. Quality is what's important. This is a quality soap at a good price. Everything from the soap to the packaging is organic and recyclable. Each soap is individually boxed with a corner showing the bar of soap. All of the ingredients are natural oils. This soap is good as a moisturizing soap. There may be a slight dryness as I feel no soap that I have used makes you feel like oil. This one is great at preventing that super dry skin that I had with regular soap.I have found that the regular soaps I was using was scented and made me smell like I have not had a bath in days. This soap takes care of all that. It does not have much of a fragrance, but compared to what I was smelling like, this soap has me smelling like clean air. When you open the box, the fragrance is strong and it seems like they all smell good and will make you smell that way. The one thing that will happen when you take a shower is, the fragrance will disappear, but that's ok because you will be clean and fresh in the end. Some people's bodies cannot handle perfumes and colognes. This soap is perfect for that purpose. There is one that is exfoliating (Tango Mango). There is also the one with peppermint. Beware not to let it get in your eyes.These soaps have a decent lather, not too much, but enough to know that it is soap. That's probably the reason that it does not dry you out. I think soaps with a lot of lather tends to dry you out more. This one rinses clean so that's a signal that it moisturizes more by not leaving soap scum on you as regular soaps do. Each soap lasted me almost a week. One of the things I really like is, I can use a bar until it dissolves completely. It does not break into pieces like another brand that I used that was extremely expensive for soap. I bought it the same time that I bought Crate 61. This soap gets razor/paper thin and continues to provide lather until it disappears on your skin. Excellent job!!! I am going to buy the one with men fragrances next. I expect the same cleaning and clean fresh smell. I have been turned off by soaps that leave you smelling like roses, perfume, or cologne. I just want to smell fresh and stay fresh all day. I did not have that with regular soaps. I rather spend the money to be clean than to save the money to smell dirty. Crate 61 will be a go to soap for me as I continue to test out natural soaps. You should not be disappointed with this soap if you had the issues as I did.",

                "reviewText": "Crate 61's Vegan Natural Bar Soap for Dry Skin has truly been a game-changer in my daily skincare routine. This pack of 6 handmade soaps is specifically designed \"For Him,\" but I can confidently say that it's a universal favorite. From the moment I first tried these soaps, I was blown away by their quality and the incredible fragrance they exude.Each bar of soap is infused with premium essential oils, giving it a luxurious and refreshing scent that lingers on the skin long after the shower. The soap itself is gentle and moisturizing, making it perfect for those with dry skin. It doesn't leave my skin feeling tight or stripped of moisture like some other soaps can.What I love most about Crate 61's Vegan Natural Bar Soap is that it's cruelty-free and vegan-friendly, aligning with my values and commitment to using eco-conscious products. The fact that these soaps are handmade adds a personal touch that sets them apart from mass-produced options.Using these soaps has become a sensory delight for me, and I genuinely look forward to my daily showers now. I appreciate the thought and care that Crate 61 puts into crafting these soaps, and it's evident in the quality of the product.If you're in search of a soap that not only pampers your skin but also elevates your shower experience with its delightful aroma, I highly recommend Crate 61's Vegan Natural Bar Soap for Dry Skin. It's a small luxury that has made a big difference in my daily self-care routine, and I'm sure it will do the same for you.",

                "reviewText": "I don't personally feel strongly about what castile soaps I buy, but these feel more luxurious than Dr. Bronner's, which are what's easily accessible in my local grocery stores. These ones are nice, and I liked the scents and that they're made in Canada. Personally, I'd prefer a palm-free option, but this is fine for people who don't feel strongly about that. My main issue with these is the citronella scent. It had rough bits all the way through, like little sticks, and it hurt to use directly on my body, especially on more sensitive areas. Since I don't want to change up how I use soap and don't want to waste a whole bar, I will probably buy these individually or in the smaller sets in the future to avoid ever getting the citronella one again. I also think the brand should be more transparent and include full ingredients lists for each soap they sell on Amazon, because it comes across as very shady to not be upfront about it.",

Will last longer than others2. Smells good without artificial perfumes3. Has a rich lather with NO FILM left on your skin (a little goes a long way, use your hand to lather after applying some to your skin)4. Doesn\u2019t have any unnecessary/junk ingredients5. Costs less than competitors (with better ingredients)I\u2019m so happy with this product! I\u2019ve tried so many bar soaps and body washes, but this was the ONLY one I could find that was cost effective, had no junk ingredients, AND didn\u2019t leave a film. After a long search, I\u2019m glad I found this company. Bonus: I love their selection of scents and it\u2019s great the packaging is biodegradable/recyclable.",

I bought these mostly because I try not to buy anything in plastic. Each soap bar comes in a little box and I wish there was less packaging but I am sure they have to do that to keep the soap bars from getting damaged. I would rather just buy homemade soap from a farmers market but this is a good second option.",

Great smell, last long, all natural ingredients and form a local Canadian company.The only downside is they're just a tad less hydrating than say Dove soap but it's to be expected from a natural soap without any chemicals and/or hydrating agent added. I sometime use Argan oil after the shower especially in the winter but most of the time I don't really need it.Other natural soap company will sell their bar for more than twice the price so these Crate 61 are an amazing value.",

Firstly, the packaging is very nice: This would make a good Easter present for your mum or your sister. I could actually smell the perfume through the Amazon packaging, and it does linger after you've used the soap. The soap itself is excellent. No frills, but lathers nicely. The first one I used was the Seaweed variety, absolutely no complaints, lather and perfume both spot on, and the soap holds its shape like you'd expect a quality soap to. My only issue is with how long the perfume lasts - you can still smell it for a long time after you've used it. My only issue with that is that some of my shaving soaps do the same, so there's a bit of a competition going on there, although it might be fun in time to try and find one the perfumes os soap and a shaving soap that complement each other. In the meantime, I have absolutely no hesitation in giving this soap overall five stars - highly recommended.",
