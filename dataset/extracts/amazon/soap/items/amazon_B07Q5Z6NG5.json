I've used this bar soap for a number of years and I'm always disappointed when I can't find it in the stores any longer! I used to buy it many bars at a time when I'd find it available in a store like Bed Bath & Beyond! But they stopped carrying it when they ruined the format of their store and closed the brick and mortar. Not happy at all with the way that BBB handled the store closures by brining in all kinds of bazar inventory that the store never sold to begin with and tried to make the customers think they were getting some 'closeout' deals! It was a disgusting display of disloyalty to loyal consumers who kept their store doors open for a number of years! Now online I do not shop with them at all! If BBB does happen to carry. this soap with their online inventory I'd never trust that it was the same product anyway. That's what happens when someone gets the brilliant idea to disrespectfully deceive loyal customers.",
