                "reviewText": "Zest was recommended to me as a face soap, many years ago, by a dermatologist, when I had issues with acne. For many years, it was the only product I could use to wash my face. Zest has changed a bit since then, but I still think it is a good soap. It now has a stronger fragrance (I would prefer less), but the scent lessens as the bar is used. I would also like to see the Aqua bar soap available in an antibacterial version, as it once was. (The antibacterial liquid hand soap is way too strong, as far as fragrance, for me.)",

It also lasts a long time, doesn\u2019t melt down as fast as other bar of soap brands. It\u2019s the ONLY thing my dad will use to shower, bathe, or wash his hands. So glad Amazon still carries it, and hopefully keeping the price reasonable.",
