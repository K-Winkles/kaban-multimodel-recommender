It has an amazing lather and though I've only been using it for a few days my skin is noticeably happier. I it less dry than when using other soaps and it seems to be more clear than it has been during my normal monthly flareups. Yay! I'm very very happy and will continue to purchase more and since I'm a gift giver I'll probably buy a few as gifts too.",
