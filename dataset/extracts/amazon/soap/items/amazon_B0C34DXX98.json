                "reviewText": "Integrity. Natural ingredients. Wholesome, fragrant, flavorful. Competitive pricing. That\u2019s what comes to mind for most who are familiar with J.R. Watkins. This wonderfully aromatic lemon soap that leaves hands clean and soft is just one of their many quality products. (As another reviewer said, their vanilla is also incredible, hands down our favorite.) There are two adults in our home, one works full time away from home, the other at home. We have a small dog, do our own landscaping, cook from scratch and spend a lot of time in our workshop on DIY projects, so we wash our hands constantly. We keep a dispenser next to six sinks - 3 bathrooms, kitchen, shop and the basement snack/coffee bar, and use about 4 gallons of liquid soap a year. Out-of-town guests a few times a year and those who come for an evening use some of it. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to have soap that doesn\u2019t turn our hands into sandpaper. Anyone who uses it in our home loves the scent and the way it makes their hands feel. Without hesitation this soap gets my highest recommendation. Almost forgot - aside from the fabulous soap, the packaging saves in so many different ways and it\u2019s recyclable! ***I have no personal affiliation with Watkins, family and friends included, and receive no form of compensation for submitting this review. ***",

I was a little nervous ordering online, because I'm sensitive to smells, and you never know what you're going to get. Safe to say, this stuff is amazing! It has a lovely smell, that isn't overpowering. It feels good on my skin, and suds up easily. I also love how the refill containers are constructed. Makes it super easy to refill my soap dispensers.
