                "reviewText": "Have used Softsoap for years. Couldn't ask for a better product. Recently listened to a discussion about skin having both bacteria and fungi on it. Actually viruses are on it too. The discussion said antibacterial soap kills bacteria but not fungi. The remaining presence of fungi can promote eczema. So I decided to do a test and wash & bathe with another liquid soap brand that simply washes -- it does not kill bacteria. I ordered this product for the high quality pump bottles. They last a very long time without the pump breaking. I swapped the Softsoap into the other product's bottles and will use it once testing is done. I am a little bit skeptical of the claim killing bacteria but not fungi is such a significant contributor to eczema. Bacteria is in the air and as soon as we wash with a bacteria killing soap it begins to repopulate on our skin. Even the towel used to dry after washing likely has some bacteria even if only from exposure to air after washing. Certainly worthwhile to do the test, just not really expecting any dramatic change to eczema. Other reports have said killing bacteria tends to result in new strains forming and they suggest washing with a nonantibacterial soap. Even they don't explain the actual mechanism. Is it the small percentage of surviving bacteria that mutate to help build resistance to antibacterial soap? The subject very quickly becomes a biology geek pursuit to really understand it.",
