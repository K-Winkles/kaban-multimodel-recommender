I do wish I could melt down the tiny used bars to make a large bar again - there are videos how to do that, so maybe I'll try someday. I do not have sensitive skin, and I don't know what \"moisturizing\" even means, so i won't rate those categories.",

It smells amazing.What I like:The scent of English Lavender is charming, to use a word. It smells divine, in my opinion. The cost of the soap is a good price. I purchased for trial. I like it very much. The soap seems very pure it melts easily.What I don't like:In light of melting, it does not last very long. I would say I use a bar a week (perhaps that is standard). Some other soaps I've used last about two weeks with the same daily bathing routine.It seems that the scent wears off quickly as it sits in the air. I suppose that it could be that I am accustomed to it.The soap leaves my skin dry but no more dry that other soaps.Would I recommend:I highly recommend this soap. But if you have very dry skin this may not be for you. If you love English Lavender then this is for you.",

I like the fact it smells absolutely wonderful and also that it's a fairly hard type of soap therefore, it lasts a long time. I'm going to put a bar in some Christmas gift bags this year to introduce to family and friends that may never have used it.",
