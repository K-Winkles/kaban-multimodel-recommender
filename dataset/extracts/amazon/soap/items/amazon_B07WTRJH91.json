                "reviewText": "I've been using this soap for three weeks now. The first thing I noticed, before even opening the package, was the scent - it's so strong! I like some floral scents, but this one is... not great. While I definitely feel cleaner after using the soap, it hasn't done much for the odors I was hoping it'd eliminate. It has helped to clear up some discolored spots I've had on my torso for several years, though, so there's that.Update: Had to stop using the soap. The smell is too strong and unpleasant and it was staining my entire soap tray blue. Not worth it at all.",
