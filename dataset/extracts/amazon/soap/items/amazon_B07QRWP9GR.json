Since 1893, do-it-yourselfers, auto mechanics, coal miners, and oil rig workers have depended on the power of Lava pumice hand soap. When regular hand soaps won't cut it, you need a heavy-duty hand cleaner that gets the job done. With the power of pumice particles, Lava Bar soap scrubs away dirt and grease while leaving your hands feeling smooth. Use a little, or use a lot. Whatever the job calls for, Lava Bar pumice soap cleans you up at the end of the day.",

There is some evidence that the \"six-pack\" was a third party assembly of 3 factory 2-packs, but that's ok.The heartburn was that two packages were delivered on the same day.First came a bubble pack with smiley Primes all over it and the label gave EZBrands as the origin in Ok City, OK. However, that package was slit down the side and empty.The second package came in a brown wrapper with its own shipping label from Texas, no business name, and had the six-pack of soap in it. This USPS tracking number was the one Amazon supplied to me on the website to track my order.Each package had its own shipping label and different USPS tracking numbers and came at different times on the same day. So there was a certain amount of heartburn trying to decide what had disappeared.",
