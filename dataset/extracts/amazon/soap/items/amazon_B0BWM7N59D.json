The soap seems very good, and the citrus fragrances are especially nice. I emptied one into another pump bottle so I could use it in the kitchen with dish-washing liquid. Nice that the design is impervious to water and other soaps, etc. (Just so you know, each is quite heavy when completely filled, and the entire package weighs a ton.) (Okay, about 15 lbs. or more)",
