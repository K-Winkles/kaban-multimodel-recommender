Not for the faint of heart, but for a man who wants a manly light scent that will leave you really really clean it's amazing. It took a full month to use the whole bar. It smells like men's soap should, but the scent is barely there, and the sandpaper like texture takes some getting used to. You do feel really clean after. It did have that sticky, dry skin feel after using it. It is a good soap for hardy men who want a good scrubbing. If the scent was strong and lingered, I would love it.",
