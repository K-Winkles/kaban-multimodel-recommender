                "reviewText": "Dove bar soap its pretty self explanatory and promotory but I will say this is my favorite Dove scent and is a gentle scent that is not overpowering. The soap itself isnt hard on sensitive skin and doesn't dry me out like most bar soaps. It can be hard to find so I always buy it in bulk when I can.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using dove for over 2 years. But this now is running short. I don\u2019t like the smell. Each bar of dove have a very special sent, but this one is very very mild until it really doesn\u2019t have a scent and if it\u2019s calming it\u2019s not doing the job.. it actually remind me of Ivory and that\u2019s a very old scent. It doesn\u2019t have any bubbles. You can rub and rub rub but nothing forms. It\u2019s just not what I think should be.. If you looking for something very very mild it may do for you, but I would never purchase it again",
