Now with the Covid going on, we wash our hands 20 times a day, I noticed my 4 year old\u2019s hands are super dry, now with this soap, it greatly help with the dryness. I got sweet water smelling one, it has a really nice, light smell as well. Only thing is regular price is bit expensive, so wait until it goes on sale and get it!",
