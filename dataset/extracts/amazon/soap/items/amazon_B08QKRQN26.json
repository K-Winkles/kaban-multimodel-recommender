            "Grisi Sulfur reduces facial shine, leaving a matte effect. Our soap will help you reduce pimples and acne by removing bacteria and absorbing excess oil by unclogging the skin's pores.",

        "description": "Grisi Sulfur Soap, when used regularly, is effective in treating acne. Our product removes dirt, unclogs pores, balances oil production, and helps remove harmful bacteria from the skin, reducing irritation. We recommend using this product in conjunction with our sulfur ointment and Madre Perla whitening cream for the best results. We formulated our soap with 10% sulfur, one of the oldest known acne treatments. This soap contains lanolin to help heal and visibly improve the damaged skin from acne, reducing irritation. If you use our soap continuously, it will help you clear acne and prevent future breakouts. Our sulfur soap is widely known for its excellent skin cleansing properties. Sulfur is a mineral in the human body and is present in all living tissues. It will help you make your skin look healthier by getting rid of pimples and blackheads and removing dead cells. Remember, two gentle washes a day are enough. Too much cleaning can leave skin irritated and dry, causing the glands to produce more oil. Your face will look smoother, and it will also help reduce inflammation. Say goodbye to acne with Grisi Sulfur Soap!",

After two weeks you can barely see any of the past inflamation and all of my skin is smoother and brighter! I wish I had started using this soap 10 years ago. Also the fact that you can get three bars for less than the price of one of the other brands is a huge plus. I only noticed the scent the first two days I used it after that I don't smell it outside of the shower at all. I even asked my husband and co-worker if they could smell me and neither one of them could. Overall this soap is great and I will continue to use this brand as long as I can.",

                "reviewText": "I researched sulfur soap because I was bitten by chiggers and had itchy whelps. I'm particularly allergic to chiggers so the discomfort can last for a week with me. Researching treatment for chigger bites, the remedy is dabbing the bites with rubbing alcohol then bathing using sulfur soap to relieve the itching. I tried it and it worked. I also suffer from chronic skin itchiness on my back. I used a handheld back scratching device multiple times during the day. So, I tried it on my back too. The itching disappeared immediately and hasn't returned.In some comments, a few suggested the soap smells 'bad'. I was expecting something off-putting but that isn't the case at all. For me, it is a very pleasant smell and immediately reminded me of something I've smelled before - sandalwood. Mysore soap from India has sandalwood fragrance in it. I love the smell of Mysore soap. The fragrance in this sulfur soap is much more subtle than that of Mysore soap but I definitely detect it. Sandalwood has a very pleasant incense note. I looked at the package contents and it simply lists 'fragrance'. I'm very happy with this soap and will continue using it every other day or so. I'm concerned that using it more often may dry my skin.",
