My household uses this product for so many cleaning tasks aside from hand washing, that we go through a lot of it. This set of three 52 oz bottles will last quite a while.",

Like.. the light scent of apple when a summer breeze blows through an apple orchard. And I know, it\u2019s not supposed to be apple, but it\u2019s the best I have and it\u2019s SO light scented. I have a nose like a bloodhound so most may smell something different. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0fI just don\u2019t care for the plastic smell of most like \u201cSoftSoap\u201d brand. Ick. Oh and THIS soap doesn\u2019t leave behind any residue and no strong smell. It all washes off and it fades quickly.This is hard to find and to find 3 at this price with free Prime shipping?
