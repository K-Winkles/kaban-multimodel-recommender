                "reviewText": "I have been a fan of this hand soap for a while as it's known to be made with a combination of natural flavoring ingredients and some amount of chemicals...I feel like when it comes to the soap sometimes less chemicals is better but cleaning is also important and this hand soap fits right in.It has a very mild fragrance of citrus, lemon grass and olive oil combination which is not super empowering but at the same time you can definitely smell it all; it lingers for sometime. The soap itself is a mild cleaner and does not lather a whole lot may be because it is made with more of the natural ingredients but is easy on your hands without making it dry and rough....I actually feel my hands are softer and smoother after using it with a refreshing scent on the hands.We have 4 bathrooms in our house and kids go through a lot of hand soap especially during the COVID time where hand cleaning was at paramount...I was looking for an alternate option and came across this product in the 33 FL OZ package; so I immediately grabbed it as it was on a special. I usually refill the smaller bottles with this soap and use a little hack to limit the amount of soap dispensed from the soap pump. I use a rubber band on the neck of the pump to limit the amount of soap that is dispensed whenpumped; if I put the rubber band on the top, it dispenses very little and if you slide it down the neck, it dispenses more. This little hack comes very handy with little kids to prevent wastage as some of these soap dispensers pump too much soap and a vast majority of it ends up in the sink but little hack makes each hand soap last twice as longer.One more thing is that this soap when dispensed is like a glob and takes couple small rubs with each of your palms to dissolve and make lather; if you rub too fast, it may just slide off into the sink.Highly recommend this soap for it's natural ingredients, bio-degradable nature and the volume savings it offers.",

                "reviewText": "I have consistently chosen Mrs. Meyer's Liquid Hand Soap Refill for several years, and I must assert that it stands as the best hand soap available in the market. The fragrance is pleasing, and the rich foam enhances the overall handwashing experience. The consistently high quality of this product continues to impress me. While the price may be slightly higher compared to other soap options, the unparalleled quality it provides makes it an investment well worth considering, and one that is challenging to surpass by any competing product",
