                "reviewText": "This scent is everything! (Lemon coconut). The scent is so nice and refreshing, seriously I love it. I've used citrus scented and coconut milk soaps before, but this combo is just awesome and uniquely different and amazing. Besides the scent: this is a great price for the amount! Especially considering all the AMAZING benefits. Its hard to find inexpensive sulfate-free soap, hard to find inexpensive cruelty-free soap, hard to find gluten free and GMO free soaps (I don't really care as much about those last 2 but at least you know it really is natural!). This is all those things and a reasonable price. The soap is not thick and creamy - it is thin in a nice way (and not oily but feels moisturizing), and I personally think a little goes a long way. Some reviewers said they needed a lot for shampoo... I don't agree. I have long hair (although kind of thin) and I have no problem, but I guess that is relative. I always use sulfate-free shampoos and the fact that they are sulfate-free, by design, automatically means they lather less so you need to kind of expect that. You don't need a thick lather to get clean-it just makes people feel cleaner when its all sudsy. That being said I do think it lathers pretty well though!! You can definitely get a little suds out of it. Seriously never thought I would write such a long review for soap, but this soap is the best and perfect balance of everything! I am going to look into Everyone's other products. Pretty sure this is made in America too, so another bonus and another reason to be amazed at the price. I don't think I will ever use another soap again. Also, haven't tried the bubble bath but I bet it will work awesome because of its consistency. Can't wait to try it.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for ways to detox my life and originally tried it because it was EWG verified. I love the way this soap smells and I love the way my skins feels after using it. I am 52 years old and have always had extremely dry skin. I will always need to use a moisturizer, but on the rare occasion that I do not use one after showering with this product, my skin never feels tight or stripped. My skin feels softer than it ever has when I follow with the coconut lemon body lotion. I have used both the soap and lotion on my face as well. I am trying to reduce the amount of plastic I use, so I do use an EWG verified bar soap most of the time now for bathing. I do still use and love the lavender liquid hand soap, however. I gifted my son with a bottle of the coconut lemon body wash for Christmas last year and he will not use anything else now.",

One caveat: They were shipped wrapped in plastic, which is great, but that didn't prevent one of the bottles from leaking all over the bottom of the box. It's as if someone squeezed the pump twice during the packing process. the other bottle was fine. So don't order anything with it that could be damaged by getting wet.
