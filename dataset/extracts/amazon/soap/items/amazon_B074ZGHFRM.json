This soap is gentle yet effective, leaving me feeling clean and refreshed throughout the day. The natural scent is subtle, which I appreciate, and it's perfect for sensitive skin. Reading the reviews about feeling clean even in hot weather was spot on it truly helps combat that sweat feeling.

I\u2019ve used Cetaphil bar soap since the 90s and it\u2019s always had a light, pleasant, smell. The smell in my last shipment of 6 bars was so bad I thought my wash cloth was sour. Tried a new wash cloth, it was the Cetaphil bar soap! It smells like straight sour lye. It\u2019s awful. I canceled my subscription order for it (had it for 3 years!)Please Cetaphil.. change it back!",

My face feels so clean and soft after. The ONLY reason it gets 4 stars and not 5 is that it is wrapped in plastic inside the little cardboard soap box.",
