Well, I saw on TV an opinion from a soap seller that goat milk soap has same PH as human skin.I do not know. All I know is that this soap is so calming, moisturising I can't believe it.It also is maybe scented, but not the Clown Soap Scent, or Organic Weirdo Tryin' Too Hard scent.This soap is so good it is ridiculous.I do like pine tar soap, and tar therapeutic soaps. We don't all want to smell like a telephone pole every day. With this pandemic I am washing my hands like crazy. They are starting to crack--not me, just my hands!!

                "reviewText": "I appreciate that this soap is gentle on my skin, yet cleans very well. The fragrance is lovely and light. I had to pay more for the order as there is currently nowhere to buy it online in Canada, so I ordered from the U.S. It was well worth the extra money. I'm thankful to have this soap to help with my various skin issues.",
