                "reviewText": "This is a very nice bath soap. I read through many of these reviews before buying. Most of the reviews are positive, and I agree with most of them. Some of the negative reviews puzzle me. And it's not my intention to be derogatory toward anyone who wrote a negative review on this product. But this soap simply does NOT smell like Play-Doh, or a cheap gas station soap, in my opinion. Now, maybe this soap smells like that to those reviewers, but I have a pretty good sniffer, and it definitely has a floral scent. It smells like flowers, and the scent is reasonably strong, but not overpowering. If you check the ingredients, it claims to contain rose essence, along with essential oils from other flower species. So, it may not smell exactly like a real rose, but the scent is definitely floral and certainly not like Play-Doh. It is very pleasant. I also like the size of these bars: just shy of 5 ounces. Frankly, I'm tired of the little 3 to 4 ounces bars they have these days, and they call them \"bath bars\"! Growing up, we used to get these nice, large \"family-sized\" bars of Dial soap that were probably 6 or 7 ounces. Bath bars have clearly shrunk and the prices have inflated! Anyway, this soap comes in a good-sized bar that doesn't disolve in two showers, and it produces a nice amount of lather. Keep in mind, too, that how much lather ANY soap produces is affected by the hardness (i.e mineral content) of your water. My tap water has a medium hardness and most soap lathers well, but if your water has a higher mineral content (from a well, for example), then it's going to be harder and more difficult to get soap to lather. Finally, (I know. Sorry to make this review so long!), I'm not crazy that SO many products we buy in the U.S. these days comes from China. But at $5 or $6 for 6 bars, the price is hard to beat for a decent, pleasant-smelling bath soap! If for some reason I can't get good quality soap at a reasonable price that's made here in my country, then China it's got to be.",

I\u2019ve been really upset at bar soap manufacturers for their shrinking bar soaps from 5 oz down to 3.5 oz and charging much more for their product. When I saw this soap I had to at least try it just because of the price. It\u2019s the largest bar soap at 5 oz for the cheapest price and you get 6 bars for under 6 bucks. That\u2019s not great prices but it\u2019s 100 percent better than what these soap manufacturers are charging for their products. These bars don\u2019t smell like roses but have a pleasant floral scent and they lather nicely and rinse off without leaving any residue. I didn\u2019t notice any dry skin as I get it pretty bad in the winter months. I would prefer either a deodorant or mens bar soap but at this price point it\u2019s a no brainer. A bar soap kept at 5 oz at a decent price.",

                "reviewText": "I'm in my mid 70's and Camay soap has been around as long as I can remember. I recall my late mother used it in the '50s as it was aimed for women. Well I'm a guy and I love this soap. It has a light floral scent that I don't at all find feminine...and dissipates quickly. It's a larger 5 ounce bar that lathers well and is harder than most, so it stands up well to shower spray. I especially like that it rinses off clean without drying my skin...hate soaps and shower gels that leave a slippery film no matter how long I rinse.Not everything can endure the test of time, but generations for almost a century have used Camay. I remember the old wrapper with an ivory cameo (inspiration for \"Camay\"?) of a woman in profile. If they brought this wrapper back, it would complete the nostalgia perfectly.This is a great soap at a very great price...$5.30 for 6 large bars...less than 90 cents a bar! This will be my go-to shower bar from now.EDIT 1/2/24: After using this soap for over 3 months, I found it to be the longest lasting bar soap I've ever used. It's the slowest to wear (wash?) down...it just lasts and lasts. Combined with the fact that they are larger than most bath bars and still priced less than 90 cents, it's likely the best bar soap value on Amazon.",

I also think it is drying my skin out. On the third day of use my bar got a big crack down through the middle of the soap. Will not be buying this again. Do not recommend.Update: I threw all my other 5 bars in the trash after my son told me it smelled like old lady soap. That\u2019s not the only reason though. Besides drying my skin I felt like it left a film on my body that would rinse off. Also the fact that my soap cracked in half. Went back to body wash. Dove body wash has a rose scent that smells pretty good. Tabu has a wonderful rose perfume. It smells so good and it\u2019s not terribly expensive.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this expecting it to smell like roses. It does not smell anything like roses. More like a gas station bathroom soap. It\u2019s really unpleasant. BUT it cleans well removing any body odor and makes my skin feel like no other soap ever has. i don\u2019t understand how this soap makes my skin feel soo soft and moisturized when it\u2019s not even touted as a moisturizer soap! Love the soap but please please please give it a new fragrance. Vanilla or coconut would be nice. Thankfully the smell leaves your body soon. Unfortunately your bathroom Will smell like it after you shower. The scent is fairly strong. I\u2019m on the fence about buying again, only because it smells soooo bad.",
