                "reviewText": "Yes, the price, at the time of this writing, is now $14 a bar. That feels stupid high (but in reality isn't, as I'll explain below). However, after years of using this particular soap, I wouldn't change, and every time we stay somewhere else and have to use a different soap I wish I had this.The scent and lather are nice, and it rinses well without drying, so you don't have that greasy feel after using a body wash, for example. However, the two things that make this a good value relative to the obviously high price, in my opinion, are:1. The bar is oversized. It is nearly twice the weight of other bars. There is just a lot more soap here.2. It has the same characteristics all the way to the end. By that I mean, I've tried other bars, and it often seems like what is useful leaches out, and toward the end you have something that doesn't lather or clean well. These soaps, for me, work right until the end.Net, this will last a lot longer than other, cheaper bars.Overall, a good value and a great experience despite the up-front price, but the price is getting close to the inflection point, even for a loyal user like me...",

                "reviewText": "Yeah, it is a bit pricey, but the soap is so gentle and has only a subtle fragrance. I love it. It doesn't last long for me. I use a bar every couple of weeks but then I like to soap up good. I also use it for my hair. It leaves my hair soft and feeling clean and fresh.",

Yes, still need more moisture after shower, so apply OSEA.Also prefer ones without harmful ingredients since we all get too many toxins no matter how careful or eat organic.",

                "reviewText": "I have used l'occitaine soap for many years. I'm generally a minimalist cheapo but I like nice soap. This stuff smells like expensive soap, and that's because it is, in fact, expensive soap, and worth every penny! I like to rotate between l'occitaine soap (luxury smelling, moisturizing soap) and defense soap (antifungal, super cleansing gym bro wrestler soap). I also like to pass these around as holiday gifts, nobody ever complains about receiving a phat bar of french triple milled soap. If you go the gifting route, would recommend you get both the lemon verbenas and the lavenders---some people are sensitive to the lavender scent ( I personally love them both)",

Su f\u00f3rmula con manteca de karit\u00e9 evita la sensaci\u00f3n de sequedad que otros jabones suelen dejar.Lo m\u00e1s destacado es su compromiso ambiental, al no utilizar aceite de palma, contribuyendo a la lucha contra la deforestaci\u00f3n. Es gratificante usar un producto que cuida mi piel y al mismo tiempo es responsable con el planeta.En resumen, el Jab\u00f3n de Manteca de Karit\u00e9 y Lavanda de L'Occitane es un producto de alta calidad que ofrece beneficios para la piel y el medio ambiente.",
