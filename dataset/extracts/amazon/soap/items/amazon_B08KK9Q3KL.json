                "reviewText": "Softsoap is the best hand soap made, period. It actually cleans hands, while leaving the skin very soft, unlike most other hand soaps on the market. Warm vanilla and coconut milk is my favorite Softsoap scent. It is a very pleasant and strong scent that will remain on the hands for a long time, even if they are washed afterward with Dawn dish soap.The only drawback (and the reason for removing 1 star) about the warm vanilla and coconut milk scent is that it is only sold in the 11 ounce pump size. My other favorite Softsoap scent, milk and honey, comes in 50 ounce refill bottles, and that makes that scent much cheaper by the ounce.Colgate-Palmolive Company, if you are reading reviews, please make the warm vanilla and coconut milk Softsoap scent in the 50 ounce refill size, and I will definitely give it 5 stars. However, for anyone looking for a great smelling hand soap, that will leave your hands soft and clean, the warm vanilla and coconut milk scent is the way to go. However, it will cost a little more since it only comes in the 11 ounce pump size. That being said, I highly recommend this warm vanilla and coconut milk scented Softsoap.",
