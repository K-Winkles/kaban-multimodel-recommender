I\u2019ve only had it for 9 days and it\u2019s down to the point of breaking in half (i.e.- almost gone) and I haven\u2019t even used it all 9 days in a row. For the price, this bar of soap should definitely last more than 12-15 days total. Won\u2019t be purchasing again and will try out other brands.",

                "reviewText": "This white bar along with the oars and alps deep cleaning bar are the perfect 1, 2 combo to have in your shower. I switch between each bar every day and nothing else that I've tried comes close to the feeling I get when I step out of the shower. This soap gives a deep clean while also moisturizing your skin and to top it off, smells amazing while doing so. Worth every penny in my opinion.",
