                "reviewText": "This bar is lathers really well and doesn't bother my skin. I have been on a quest to try and use more and more natural products so I really love that this seems to be mostly natural ingredients. The original scent scores a 3 on EWG, which is a good thing as 1 is the best and 10 is the worst (consider it danger levels). The unscented kinds scores a 1. The only reason for 3 instead of a one is that fragrance is considered an iffy ingredient. The soap is wrapped in easily recyclable paper, but sadly the multipack is in plastic. The plastic wrap is the main reason why I'm debating on a switch. It doesn't dry out my skin, seems to clean well, and smells pretty normal so nothing strong or anything (it you want a really scented soap you might want to look elsewhere). I personally like this soap. It's also a normal bar size so cheaper than some since it's not uncommon to see natural soap sell for a higher price than this.",

Your people don\u2019t like bars, anything that produces foam/bulbs. That\u2019s great but I don\u2019t feel clean with liquid soap. So for people still using Bars I think you\u2019ll find this a games changer. It produces bubbles. I feel clean and my skin feels comfortable, not dry. I\u2019ve used it for years and I\u2019m sold. Won\u2019t be switching to anything else. Give it a try. You can get it online but brick and mortar stores carry it too (I get mine at Publix in Florida).

                "reviewText": "Some kind of annoying algorithm used by Amazon to be sure to charge you as much as they think they can get away with, but I digress. I find this soap to be gentle on my skin and make everything so, so soft. It's worth the extra money to get things clean or soft and prevents you from having to use products that are overburdened with chemicals.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a bar of this soap to try making laundry soap. Before I could get around to doing that, I wound up using it in the shower. The lather from this bar is different than the Oil of Olay soap I've been using for lord-only-knows how long. The lather bubbles are much smaller and there are about a bazillion more of them packed together. It makes the lather SO SOFT and it goes all over without having to use tons of the bar. I was VERY pleased when I rinsed it off and my body felt all \"squeaky clean\" like the liquid castile soaps that I have used before. It makes me not want to use a washcloth so I can get the full effect. I don't feel a residue but I want to wash with it more because I love the feel of this lather. I like the clean smell of it and the natural look and feel of the bar. I found it in 3 packs at my grocer and it is now in regular rotation with the liquid tea tree soaps. I'm getting better at going more natural in my skin care products and this was a good choice for me. Knowing how soap is made helps too, it's basically lye mixed with fat and then cured. The fat here is coconut oil which is pretty much the best fat ever for everything from cooking to lotion or hair care. A reviewer said to unwrap and store the soap so it can cure more, that is correct. Really good soap gets better when it cures longer.",
