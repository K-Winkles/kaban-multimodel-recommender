                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars As good as the huge brand names but a much better price tag",
                "reviewText": "This is one of these products that for a while we couldn't find it anywhere but now that it's much more accessible I like to keep it around and just refill the smaller bottles so I'm making a smaller gentle dent on the environment here. I noticed that this particular brand does not leave my hands half as dry as many of the other well-known brands. Also with the list of these products increasing that are actually hazardous, I cannot specifically name the brands or what makes them hazardous but I certainly do look online before buying any of these hand sanitizer products to make sure what I'm purchasing is not a danger and this certainly is not one of those. It is efficient and I just keep refilling my smaller bottles for myself and my husband and it's easy and it smells nice and you can tell it has some alcohol but not enough to burn holes through your skin but you get the feeling and the scent that is of clean Skin. The price point is so much less then the big name brands I don't understand buying one of them when they have the exact same ingredients as this one does. I actually took a photograph which I'm sorry but I erased from my phone but I did take a photograph of the ingredients of this cleaner to Target with me because I wanted to see if it was missing something that the brand names had and they're exactly the same more or less. And when I say more or less everyone uses something different for fragrance and I like whatever Amazon is using because it's extremely subtle and almost disappears and doesn't compete with perfumes and such when you use it. I'm going to continue to buy this product but it does come in a giant bottle so it's going to last a long time before I buy another. The next one will be my third and I can't even remember when I bought the first one. The good news is, when you needed it comes extremely fast and well packaged so you not going to get a damaged product and it's definitely not on the danger list of products we should not be using on our skin all the time and for me and my husband and everyone it's really important we use nothing hazardous on our skin but for us we both deal with skin allergies and this has had absolutely no negative effects on either one of us. To be really clear the second I get a chance to wash my hands in a real way with soap and water it is clearly the better way but with that being said, we have to live in a world where we have to be more careful and as much as you don't realize you do touch your face and you do touch your hair and you touch things and then you touch yourself some more. Recently somebody was filming me as a joke for something silly I was. doing. I know it wasn't Tik Tok it was just me being silly and talking but I had no idea how many times I touched my eye glasses touched my hair and even realized how much I spoke with my hands and then leaned back on a countertop and so you really can't wash your hands and you're not always at home of course it's the best way but in the meantime buy this product for the rest of the time when you're not near a sink where you can do a thorough hand-washing (like I use Uber a lot)& because it's important to do both. I don't know if I would call this giftable but I guess it could b so in the Mean Time it's highly usable I have had no allergic reaction , I know it smells good and light and clean so for your safety wash your hands and when you can't this is a great option where the great price tag that comes fast and has great availability hey. You can do what I did and take a picture of the ingredients and put it up against any of the big boys and pay tons more but I don't have the luxury of being able to afford they're really expensive Brands and I also don't see the reason to when this is just as good if not better",

By the kitchen sink, upstairs bathroom sink, the vanity sink area in the master and the half bath sink downstairs and I don\u2019t want to buy new pumps every time bc I don\u2019t want to throw them away when they work perfectly fine. I don\u2019t like to create more plastic waste if I can help it so I use this clear refill in all of them. No mess, works just fine and smells good without being too strong. Very happy with it and for the price I try to keep stocked up bc it doesn\u2019t take long to go through it around here.I keep a lotion pump by each sink too to keep my hands from looking like the crypt keeper!(Just Google it, kids!) but that\u2019s a different product for a different review.Definitely recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I've been trying different soaps, trying to find something that cleans but that also isn't too sudsy. I spend like 45 seconds running water just to get rid of all the suds in my sinks with the soaps I've been using. I know that may be a function of my stoppers and the space for water and suds to go down the drain, but without spending a bunch of money to change that, I looked to this soap for help with the issueIt's lightly scented, does the job and doesn't create so much suds that I have to waste water getting it all down the drain.",
