        "description": "Many of us suffer from acne, blemishes or problem skin at some point in our lives. Salicylic Acid and Sulphur are two ultimate powerhouse ingredients in helping to achieve healthy beautiful skin and helping us look the best version of ourselves. The magic of the soap starts with the abundant exfoliating almond and walnut shell particles which deeply cleanse pores, and stimulate cell renewal. Salicylic Acid makes light work of unclogging pores, and removing dead cells revealing clearer, renewed complexion. And to ensure problem skin doesn't return the active ingredient, Sulphur, naturally goes to work in removing bacteria and absorbing excess oil. The treatment doesn't finish there, Vitamin E one of the best moisturising ingredients in the business, leaves the skin feeling incredibly soft, nourished and ready to face the world. This is a must have treatment for all those with problem skin. 80g | Made in England",

                "reviewText": "This bar is great! It has chemically exfoliated my skin in areas that have had chronic folliculitis and generally rough or bumpy skin my whole adult life. Mostly on my butt.- I leave it on my skin (body only, no face) for about 30 minutes every OTHER day. I spray my body with water and apply the soap. I think it would be less effective in the shower if used for only a couple of minutes a day, but experiment.- I\u2019m a guy and my butt feels completely smooth and soft for the first time in my life. No raised bumps, acne or rough patches. The change is crazy!- The smell isn\u2019t awful. The sulfur is masked with a light fragrant scent. Not too bad but maybe use another soap afterwards if you\u2019re going to be around others and don\u2019t want to carry this smell.- The bar itself can be a bit scratchy so I lather up my hands and apply the soap all over. It will exfoliate chemically so no real need to endure pain.- You\u2019ll start noticing how it works after a couple uses and by week 2, your skin should feel very different than when you started.- Can be drying. I recommend lightly moisturizing afterwards.Will continue using!",

                "reviewText": "Originally bought to help remedy jock itch, which it did (thank goodness). But as I continued to use it I realized it was helping with my butt acne, KP, AND my strawberry skin on my legs. Not sure if it's intended for those uses but HOLY CROW. I've always had clear skin on my face but I have NEVER in my entire life (and I'm 33) had such clear and smooth skin on my arms and legs. And I have spent thousands of dollars over the years on SO many things (KP creams/cleansers, othery SA creams, cleansers & lotions, exfoliants, different loofahs and scrubbers, different razors etc) to try to remedy these issues. This simple bar of soap is an actual miracle product for $8. It is slightly drying so a basic moisturizer or oil -- I use an Olive Oil, Sweet Almond oil, Jojoba oil, Grape seed oil, Sunflower Oil & vitamin E blend from \"Ancient Greek Remedy\"-- will help keep you hydrated without causing issues. If you've got any or all of the following KP/strawberry legs/acne/jock itch... Give this a try. I will never be without it again in my home.",

I\u2019ve been using it on my back annd legs and wow\u2026my back and legs are soft, smooth and blemish free! I use it in conjunction with the cerave cream. Only downside is it turned my ring yellow so I\u2019d advise not to wear jewellery while showing with this soap. But it definitely works!!!",

Stinkt auch nicht so schlimm, wie ich es mir vorgestellt habe \ud83d\ude05 ich habe sie noch nicht lange, weswegen ich zur Wirkung nicht viel sagen kann. Trocknet die Haut ein wenig aus aber das ist wohl normal bei Schwefelseife.",
