The scent is a soft, subtle scent that is not strong or overwhelming. The consistency is neither runny nor overly thick, but the perfect consistency. The bottle under the cap is sealed to prevent leaking or tampering. Lastly, it\u2019s a great price when combining subscribe & save, coupon and multi-buy discount.",

It\u2019s not too thin. Really, it\u2019s perfect. Thick soap tends to be hard to come out of the decorative dispensers.The only thing I wish is that there are more variety in scents. I think a woody scent would be nice. Like cedar with a hint of vanilla. Just throwing ideas out there.",

                "reviewText": "Smell really good. Great soap. Love the Amazon essentials brand. Only problem is one of the lids came broken on one of the bottles so it spilled a little soap in the box and I had to find something to use as a makeshift lip for the open bottle. Packaging needs more protection so that doesn't happen.",
