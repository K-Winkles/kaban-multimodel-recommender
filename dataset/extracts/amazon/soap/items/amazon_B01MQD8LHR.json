The coconut scented soap is mild and there are no harsh chemicals being used. My wife has very sensitive skin when it comes to using beauty products, such as soap, but this soap is easy on her skin and effective in cleaning.",

                "reviewText": "I've now been using this bar soap as a hand and facial soap for a couple of years.Yes, on my face!I wanted something to cleanse with on a daily basis that was gentle, scent-free, and plastic-free. And relatively inexpensive! I am an older redhead, and have tried many different cleansers over many years, due to my sensitive skin.This fits my needs wonderfully! I'm happy to say that this bar soap cleanses, for me, in a non-irritating and extremely gentle fashion. I occasionally augment my routine with a pricey cleanser from L'Occitane, but that is really no longer necessary for me; this is the soap I reach for morning and night.",

It has a really good lather which I really enjoy. It also makes you feel clean but doesn't give you that \"squeaky clean\" that leaves your skin dry. After I shower I feel like my skin is moisturized and refreshed. I enjoy the packaging as well it is very minimal and better for the environment. I just wish it was a little more affordable to buy this. Each bar is about 4$ and that seems a little steep. Great soap if you can afford the luxury.",

Compared to other natural soaps I have tried this is superior. Wish I could find in store, but this is a good deal and I will continue to buy.",

                "reviewText": "I've been trying for a while now to find a soap that would not irritate my skin. I occasionally get contact dermatitis/eczema so it was quite important that I found something which would not bother my skin. If you're wonder what that means: I basically get rashes, irritations, scales, and/or bumps on my skin quite easily depending on the ingredients in the products that I use on my skin.So here's the story on this soap, I randomly stumbled onto it while in a store one day, and decided to give it a try. I was a bit hesitant as I started using it because I was cautious about some kind of reaction happening, so I used it minimally, and didn't notice any problems. I used it for about a week before deciding I would buy another bar. I eventually started using it quite liberally and it's been working great since. I've actually been buying it for a little while now and I normally buy the 6 pack on Amazon. I would suggest buying that one if you do end up buying it as I've never had a problem with it, and I see a few reviews saying the other ones are oddly sized and such. Personally, I have only used the coconut bar so I can't speak for any of the others. I personally think this soap does a pretty good job at cleansing and moisturizing your skin while not being too harsh on it. One thing I noticed is that it leaves sort of a sheen on your skin (I believe this is one of the oils in it), it dries up a little bit shortly after you dry your hands, but there's still something left behind. You can also taste it a little if you don't dry your hands properly between washing and eating something with your hand. One thing you don't want to do with this bar is leave it in water as it will melt. Make sure you put it in a dry spot after using it or in a soap dish that drains. If you have sensitive skin, I would definitely recommend that you give this soap a try. I can't make any promises but I hope this product works as well for you as it did for me. I'll still search for more products that I can use on my skin, because you never know when a company may decide to change the ingredients or your skin decides that it doesn't want to play nicely with something anymore.",
