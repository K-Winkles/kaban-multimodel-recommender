                "reviewText": "I love that the soap is made in America! The soap is made using natural ingredients. The smell is not overwhelming and is very pleasing. The lather action could be improved but with a little grind you can get a nice lather. All in all this is a nice, natural, chemical free soap. Nice size bar that will last longer than a week like most natural soaps.",

The soap itself is very cleansing. It feels moisturizing, but still squeaky clean once rinsed off This is my second time purchasing, and I will continue to in the future.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this because I had a bad PUPPs rash postpartum. I read Pine Tar soap can help relieve the itch, and this soap could arrive faster than Grandpa\u2019s. I did experience some relief, whether it was the soap or placebo effect, I\u2019m not sure, because I have nothing to compare it to. I\u2019d really give the soap 3.5 stars, but that\u2019s not an option. If you want a simple pine tar soap, I\u2019d suggest looking elsewhere- I found Grandpa's soap cheaper. If you want a \u201cformer\u201d soap that\u2019s reminiscent of pine tar, this is a good bet.PROS: The smell is there but mild. It has gentle exfoliation and is moisturizing. It looks nice- it could even be given as a gift.PRO&CON: The directions give you a way to \u201cage\u201d the soap, to make it last longer, but you have to wait a week.CONS: It is super soft- granted, I was taking really long showers to relieve my itch, but this only lasted about 5-6 showers. This was a major con, considering the price. It also left a black residue in my tub.Updated to directly compare with Grandpa\u2019s Soap:PINEY-NESS: Grandpa\u2019s has more pine. This one probably has as much or equal charcoal, creating the black color and the more mild scent.SMELL: Grandpa\u2019s smells like a fire pit after you\u2019ve burned pine. This soap smells like a black Yankee Candle.COST: I got a 3 pack of Grandpa\u2019s for $2 more than I paid for 1 bar of this soap.RESIDUE: Grandpa\u2019s leaves regular soap residue, about what I get with a regular bar of soap. This soap leaves a noticeable black residue with each use.DURABILITY/LONGEVITY: Grandpa\u2019s lasts longer, definitely.LOOK: Grandpa\u2019s looks like a light brown bar of soap. This one is definitely prettier and could be left out as a decorative soap.OVERALL: If you want a decorative soap with some pine tar qualities, go with this one. If you want a \u201ctrue\u201d pine tar soap, keep shopping.",
