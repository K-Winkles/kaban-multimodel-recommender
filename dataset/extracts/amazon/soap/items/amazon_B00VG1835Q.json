But it's more expensive now, and this is almost identical. It's nicely moisturizing, especially in cold, dry winters, and a really excellent price. I love supporting artisanal businesses as well. It lasts forever, smells clean but the scent doesn't linger to interfere w/perfume. And olive oil is really good for the skin. Can't go wrong with this.",

                "reviewText": "The soap has been wonderful to use. It cleans well, and does not clog pores or dry out my skin. I started using a bar around the New Year. It's almost April, and I'm still using the same bar. I had no idea that buying a six-pack might last me years. So, it's quite a bargain, given its longevity.As another reviewer noted, these bars are big. I wear a medium glove, just to give you an idea. For the first six weeks I had to handle it with both hands, due to its size and resistance to melting.Given its durability, and that I still have 5 unopened bars, as well as a few more weeks of use available with my first bar of soap, I'm hoping that it is still available, at such a good price, when I'm finally ready to reorder.",

                "reviewText": "The reason why this batch of soap smells smokey is because of all of the Greek fires. This was stored somewhere near a big fire. I used the bar generously and the smoke smell is almost non-existent; another shower should take care of the last bit of smoke scent. I don't mind paying this price for a beautiful soap of 100 percent pure olive oil to help with Greece's economy. The fires were devastating. (I'm in California and we are having our own fair-share of fires, smoke is everywhere).As for the soap: 100 percent pure luxurious olive oil that leaves your skin so soft. It doesn't dry or leave your skin taut. I find I don't need to use olive oil on my body after my shower but I still use it on my face. I love Olive oil, being Italian.The bar can be quite large for smaller hands so cutting it in half with wire or floss will make an easier to hold bar. It doesn't suds, it's creamy yet still cleans excellent.** *****We have a water softener.***I set the rest of the bars of soap out back under the patio to let them air out to see if it clears the smoke scent. I'll report back asap to let you know.****Took another shower and the smoke scent is still there but definitely lighter. The smoke scent doesn't linger on my skin. I use sandalwood oil for my fragrance and the smokiness isn't noticeable. In-between using this soap I use Olive Oil/Laurel soap which is my absolute favorite.***Still waiting for the other soaps outside to air out...will let you know.",

I wash my face with this and have never had a breakout. My face feels soft and smooth and is well hydrated. This is the ONLY product I use on my face other than make up. The bar is nice and large and lasts a long while. If they ever stop offering these soap bars I\u2019m going to order a lifetime supply. I am SUPER PICKY.

                "reviewText": "After reading various reviews online about this soap I decided to try it. Wow, I couldn't be happier with my purchase! If you need some soap RIGHT AWAY, then order something else because this took about 5 weeks to arrive (but I knew it would take awhile when I purchased it). It was well worth the wait though. Don't panic if you don't receive all 6 bars at once. I received 3 bars in one package and then a few days later I got a second package of 3 bars.I just noticed a review where someone said their bars were 4 oz. I went and got one of my bars and weighed it on my (very precise) kitchen scale and it weighed 8.75 ounces, so the bars are even bigger than advertised. I think a mistake was made with that reviewer's order and they probably just need to contact the company.If you have sensitive skin then THIS IS THE SOAP FOR YOU. Very few ingredients: Sodium Olivate (saponified olive oil), Aqua, Sodium Chloride, and Citric Acid (a natural pH balancer). There's nothing here that irritates my skin. I first tried Kiss My Face Olive Oil soap and that had a strong scent and got all gooey after it sat for awhile. This soap has a much milder scent and you don't lose all the soap into a gooey mess. It does get a little \"soft\" but nothing like the Kiss My Face soap. This soap is WAY better - and cheaper. I'm so glad I discovered this!",
