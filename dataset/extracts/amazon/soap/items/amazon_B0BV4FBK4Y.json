                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using this product for years. It\u2019s great for dry skin or eczema.It may not eliminate the need for body lotion after your shower, but it is much milder than most liquid body soaps. It\u2019s a great, affordable sulfate/paraben-free option.A few notes:1) It is \u201cunscented\u201d but not \u201cfragrance free.\u201d There is a very light fragrance added to mask the scent of the other ingredients. It smells pleasantly neutral & doesn\u2019t linger. But if you truly need fragrance free products for allergy reasons, this ain\u2019t it.2) It does not lather as well as other body washes, due to added moisturizers and lack of sulfates. It will still leave you feeling clean and fresh.3) Do not try to use it as a bubble bath. It won\u2019t make bubbles at all. I still take baths with it, but I find that I have to first dispense it into a dish and swish it together with a little water before adding it to the bath. Otherwise \u201cchunks\u201d of product float in the water and it\u2019s gross.",
