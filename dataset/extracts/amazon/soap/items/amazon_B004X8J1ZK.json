It is super lathering, and makes for a great shaving soap. As well as body washing soap and if need be, for my face (though usually I go for something different). It never ever irritates my sensitive skin.I absolutely adore the scent of the classic white Dove beauty bar. Reminds me of my childhood. We never actually had it in our home, but a friends house I stayed at all the time used Dove. I bathed all the time there, and used these creamy soaps that were oh so different from the harsh soaps used at home. Then a little later as a teen, I made a friend whose family also used Dove. It has a memorable scent, and I remember then it brought me back in time. It scents up the bathroom a bit, and I can always recognize it when I am near a bar. Now forward many years and I have been buying my own soap. Basically got into body washes, then fancy soaps, and eventually went back to good old Dove bar. It just brings me a little joy to smell it, and the nice soft cleansing that it has makes it a perpetual favorite. I may try other stuff, but I come back to Dove. It is just lovely.",

                "reviewText": "Our preferred brand of glycerin soap recently became harder to come by, so we decided to try out Dove brand bar soap as a replacement. We bought three scents: White, Pink (marketed for women), and Extra Fresh (marketed for men). All three performed similarly:- Lathers well- Nice tactile feel (silky)- Hair sticks to it more than glycerin soap, making it harder to wash off- Wears away faster than glycerin soap- Smells like soapThis functions well enough for our needs, but I won't be buying any of these scents again. They just smell like soap. Not NASTY soap (like at McDonald's or at hospitals) - just soap. So if you get any kind of enjoyment or aromatherapy from herbal, floral, fruity, or other botanical soap.. you aren't going to get that here. Which I only realized was important to me now that it's gone. So we'll work our way through this soap and then find another brand.",
