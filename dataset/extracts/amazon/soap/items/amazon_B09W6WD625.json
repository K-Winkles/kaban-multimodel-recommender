It\u2019s a good size: big enough to last longer, but not so oversized that you can\u2019t hang on to it easily. It\u2019s a little rough when you rub the bar directly on your skin, but I like that for knees and elbows. It also removed the dead flaky skin from my sunburned arms. If you lather it up in your hands you can wash anywhere else you don\u2019t want the abrasive effect. I\u2019m completely satisfied with this product. I would prefer a lower price, but I\u2019m willing to pay what higher quality costs.",
