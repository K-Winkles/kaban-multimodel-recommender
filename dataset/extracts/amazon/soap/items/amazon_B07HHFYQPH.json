I have been using a facial cleaner and it never got my skin completely clean feeling. This soap does exactly what it says. It gives you a deep cleaning. Like I said I have been using Cerva Ve facial cleanse for a year and it never got my face that clean. I have oil skin and I am in my 40\u2019s so I have been dealing with hormonal acne and a lot of breakouts. My skin is very sensitive and this soap did not irritate my skin at all. I started this week washing my face with this soap first and then doing a double cleanse with my facial cleaner and I notice a huge difference in my skin on the first double cleanse. I notice the texture on my face clearing up and I have not had a breakout at all and my skin glowing.My skin is very clean and does not get oil like it use to. I am so happy to found this soap and I will continue to use it. Fantastic product",
