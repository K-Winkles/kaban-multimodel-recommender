                "reviewText": "I grew up using bar soap, and realizing that very few plastic bottles ever actually get recycled, I decided it was time to return to simpler times. Although I have used some very nice liquid hand soaps, paying for a plastic bottle that will probably be around long after I\u2019m gone left me feeling guilty. Refillable hand soap bottles are a good idea, but the refill soap usually comes in fairly thick plastic pouch and unless you use a funnel you end up with soap all over the counter\u2026it just seemed like more trouble than I wanted.This bar soap is everything I wanted\u2014great lavender fragrance, lathers well, does not irritate my sensitive skin, and rinses off very easily (faster than any liquid I\u2019ve tried). It leaves my skin feeling slightly moisturized, which is a plus\u2014I have even used it on my face a couple of times with no problem. We are using it in the kitchen as well as the bath now, and it cleans greasy hands better than the liquid soap we used before. All in all, it\u2019s a high quality soap that does what it should and leaves a lovely (but not overpowering) scent.",

I do solidly like it, but there is very little scent and what scent there is, is not at all what I was hoping for. It has more of that vague beeswax-type scent, which isn\u2019t what I was looking for.However it is a very smooth soap that feels great to use, very soft on the skin, and rinses perfectly clean, and on those grounds I\u2019d absolutely buy it again, I would just wish the scent was a little different/better. The bars are smaller than our standard ones, but that\u2019s not a detriment. You won\u2019t go through it that fast, and the benefit is it won\u2019t get gross like a large bar eventually does, and it\u2019s just nicer to use. I use it for bath soap and even replaced my liquid hand soap with it because I like it better.",

It does just the job. It beautifully works on the skin and it leaves my bathroom fragrance free.In the time of allergies it is really perfect soap for those who are concerned about irritating additives and search for plain but dignified elegant products that are connected to the past simple and effective natural thechologies.This soap has a very long tradition and French People trust this brand with their daily hygiene.I have been using it for some 10 years now and never had any problems. The soap is very consistent from bar to bar. There is no variation and it always does the superb job.For those who like fragrance this soap won't deliver but this brand has other soaps in this series that do come in nice natural fragrance collection choices and if I were to seek for fragranced soap I certainly would not hesitate to trust those fragrances as they use natural ingredients.There is something magical when you hold this bar of soap and when you put it on your skin.. it takes you back to France.. to the beautiful plains, vineyards, castles, seashores and ocean side, to the Riviera and to Paris and all over the place. Mind is a magical think because you can close your eyes and imagine that you are being transported to the places that this sap has been born in.. and that's the power of the French Soap .. and your imagination :)...I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SOAP!",
