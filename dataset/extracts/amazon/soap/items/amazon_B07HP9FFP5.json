                "reviewText": "Ever since I can remember, ivory soap has stood out to me as what I could count on to wash the oils from my face, scalp, or anywhere else on my body. Other soaps either didn\u2019t clean well or left my with its residue which I don\u2019t like from a soap. Ivory doesn\u2019t have a particular \u201csmell\u201d but I use soap to get clean and not scented.The only downside is that I\u2019ve heard that ivory doesn\u2019t last like some other brands. I\u2019ve not really noticed but to the end of having it on hand and not having to repurchase too frequently, this 10 and 30 bar lots are more in line with my use and needs. One of the greatest listings I\u2019ve found is the option for 80 of the \u201cbig bars\u201d for around $36, so less than.50 each. And the 15 percent discount from subscribing gets it under $30 so it\u2019s the greatest purchase of something I regularly use and always want available for a price I\u2019d never find in any store. 80 bars is a full retail case of 8 packs of 10 bars each so it\u2019s a serious amount of soap for your money. I\u2019m so happy to have discovered another of \u201cmy\u201d products that I can get brought to my front door.",
