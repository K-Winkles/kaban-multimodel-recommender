                "reviewText": "As one poster stated, if you are not interested in \"cucumber mint melon breeze\" in your soap, this may be what you are looking for. I think it is also the best soap for brushing your teeth. It's nearly tasteless, whereas olive oil soap tastes yacky; however, if you do so, you must brush 3x/day, since your teeth will have no protection, but therefore, they will remineralize, and your gums will thank your for it. Toothpaste is very hazardous to gums and teeth, especially the fluoride kind. The glycerin in a glob of toothpaste creates a Saran Wrap-like coating that prevents remineralization, and the fluoride destroys the enzymes in the mouth that help bond the gums to the teeth. Also, it is critical to have high value nutrition with the co-dependent vitamins A/D/K if you are concerned with remineralization and gum health.This is not a \"mild hypoallergenic\" soap as some claim, it is just soap with extra glycerin and coconut oil added for anti-microbial and moisturizing effects. Which is critical, since coconut soap is the strongest soap of all oils/fats one can saponify. Coconut soap is the only soap that will lather in ocean water, and it produces loads of suds in fresh water. Many people complain that they get a burning feeling on their face or groin from the soap, but the real key to these problems may be the fact that the soap primarily irritates areas of the body with the highest microbial concentrations, which may indicate that high colonizations of susceptable microbes in the skin in those areas are the problem - and not the soap. Contrary to people that think they are allergic to glycerin, true allergies are generated by the immune system which responds to foreign proteins, not things like glycerin.I dislike the added glycerin which I believe is primarily added to lessen the cost (glycerin is almost free for the taking on the market and much cheaper than coconut oil). Also, the ingredient list has changed in the last few years from extra coconut oil > glycerin to extra glycerin > coconut oil. On the other hand, these are all products of soap mfg. But more to the point is that I believe all these complaints about rashes/burning/stinging have more to do with skin infections (yeast/fungi) and die-off than \"being sensitive\", which is really a silly term because skin cells are skin cells, and unless your whole body is burning from head to toe, you have a problem in a certain area, which is most likely due to the population of microorganisms in that particular area, as opposed to a completely different kind of skin ... Glycerin (as well as coconut oil to a degree) is strongly anti-microbial when the concentration is high enough (80% or so to the best of my memory), in fact, it's used as a microbial preservative. Therefore the extra added glycerin may be at the root of these types of problems, but it may be a good problem that eventually makes your skin healthier, as opposed to a bad product that is hurting skin. In such cases, it may be usefuI to keep using it daily even if it burns a lot, and then decide after several weeks if skin health is improving or not. When you consider the thickness of a soap film, the amount of glycerin and coconut oil on the skin is very very small, and especially considering that it is only on the skin for a few minutes. So, it may be good to reconsider the \"sensitive skin\" idea, because there really is nothing too irritating in this soap - check diet and overall skin health before claiming \"sensitive skin\".The difference between Bronner's and Kirk's is that Kirk's is super-fatted with Coconut Oil, and does not contain other essential oils, but does contain extra added Glycerin (lye + oil = soap + glycerin) on top of the 50% or so that is normal in a natural soap. While Bronner's may be slightly super-fatted with oil to ensure the lye is completely utilized in the reaction, they do not say with what oil - so possibly is slightly super-fatted with their combinations of oils. But mainly, the difference is that Bronner's contains added Essential Oils but no added Glycerin. And also, Kirk's is 100% a corporate commodity, while Bronner's is still pretty much a family affair and supports various \"green/fair trade\" business practices and lefty causes. And for those that use Bronner's for the EO effects, it is far better to mix Tea Tree + Eucalyptus 50/50 than to use either alone, at least as far as anti-microbial effect is concerned. They are really a little stupid for not just selling a single TeaTree+Eucalyptus soap. Personally, I got turned off to Bronner's when dealing with the company - it was like dealing with an ad hoc business run by a part-time employee with no business experience. I am surprised they are able to maintain any kind of serious business operations after my experience with them, but they seem to be happy serving a small loyal base.Also, you can't use coconut soap like other soaps, because a little goes a long way unlike other soaps. 2 swipes across a hand is enough to create gobs of lather, and everyone complaining that it melts fast is missing the main factor which is that this is a \"mostly glycerin\" bar of \"soap\". There is more glycerin in the bar than soap. That is why it \"decays\" faster than other soaps in water. On the other hand, that makes it useful for cleaning because you can just put the bar in a bucket, fill it with hot water, and then take the bar out, and you have a bucket with just the right amount of soap to do some cleaning. But in an honest world, this product would be labeled as \"Glycerin Bar with Soap and Coconut Oil\".Some people note that it doesn't leave hard-to-get-off-the-tub soap scum. That is true with all pure soaps ... In addition to \"chemical soaps\" containing things that may harden water, coconut oil soap, due to it's chemical nature, naturally rinses cleaner, and it probably also has to do with the fact that glycerin is part of the \"scum\", and most glycerin is removed from \"chemical soaps\".Also, for general health, it is important to understand that the shower is one of the dirtiest places in a home due to daily moisture - the mold and bacterial growth is phenomenal in a shower - just entering the shower and turning the water on releases zillions of spores into your lungs from all the invisible mold in a shower, in fact, enough to be a very serious bio/health hazard. Personally, I wash my shower every day with a powder bleach cleanser, and recommend that to everyone! Showers are filled with moisture and the substances put out from sneezing, peeing, breathing, dead skin cells, all the oils and organic substances washed off the skin and hair, and just tons of stuff that make it a super-petri dish. Really, a shower is the most unhealthy place you could ever step into. This was studied at the University of Iowa many years ago (to the best of my memory) and can be researched.If you really want a good quality soap, you must make your own. Any commercial soap is like comparing Wonder Bread to home-made bread. It's really like night and day difference. I have never found any commercial soap to even come close to the quality of a home-made soap. Not even close. But I must say, Kirk's is one of the best you can get outside of making your own.",
