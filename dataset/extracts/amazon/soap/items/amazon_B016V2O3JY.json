I just get some essential lemon oil and put a couple of drops on my wash rag with the soap. I wish the makers would start adding some essential oils to them to make them smell better! I've been using this soap for 2 years and I love it however the last batch I got smelt rotten. I mean it already kind of stinks anyway but I believe the last batch was rank. I didn't contact the company to see if they would replace it. I've just been using extra lemon oil to knock the smell out, which works.... I haven't tried any other essential oils to see if it would help the smell just because I like the lemon oil and it works so good.",
