                "reviewText": "Pros * Dense, solid soap that should last a good while. * 4.5 oz size which is same size as regular bars of soap (sometimes specialty soaps are small so I am glad this one isn't). * Draws dirt and impurities from my skin. * Noticed less redness in my skin. * Makes my skin feel moisturized because of all the healthy oils and butters in here. * All natural ingredients, nothing fake or chemical. * Has a unique smell because of the eucalyptus, lemongrass & peppermint. At first I wasn't sure I liked the smell of it because I am picky with scents. I like it pretty good now and I notice when I walk into the bathroom, my bathroom smells cleaner because I have it sitting by the sink.Cons * I love that dead sea mud was first ingredient but I wish the activated charcoal wasn't the last ingredient (except for the scented oils). I think it cleans great but just in my mind when I see one of the helpful ingredients towards the bottom, it makes me wonder exactly how much is in there.Other * I use a waterfall soap dish I bought from amazon. This keeps it drained so the soap doesn't sit in water.",

                "reviewText": "I never excepted this to be my new favorite soap but turns out I was very wrong.This soap is amazing besides using this on my face which by the way reduced the size of my pores and the last blackhead on my nose has surfaced and looks as though it should be gone very soon.I also never ever thought I would even consider using this in my hair but I took the chance after reading a review about someone using this on her child's hair and decided I would too.My hair has never looked so healthy and so shiny. I normally use high end brands of shampoo and conditioner and for a weekly detox I used Alterna detox with red clover to remove all styling products .That said this is by far the best .I will not use this daily on my hair but weekly I will and of course daily on my skin.My Husband also used this and to my surprise really liked this alot his hair looked better than I have seen it in along time.Doesn't take long at all to see the great results ,smells good and not abrasive at all.Has not dryed out my skin or caused any irritation. Also I want to mention how wonderful this company is.I order almost daily from Amazon and I have not had to many sellers email to follow up on a purchase I wish I remembered her name but I'm posting this from my cell phone and would take time for me to go back into my emails, however I wanted to say Thankyou! This is a company that actually cares if you received your order and if your satisfied. Will definitely be placing more orders and highly recommend this soap and seller!",

                "reviewText": "I started using this soap (along with apricot scrub every other day and Mederma/Vitamin E oil mixed in with 3 drops of calamine lotion as follow up daily moisturizer) as part of my cystic acne problem that I recently developed. In the first 2 weeks or so, I developed the zit-alike pimples which pops up every night/day but they disappear in the morning or by end of the day. It was irritating and discouraging at first but as the package warns it is expected. But after 2 weeks, it helped my acne. I LOVE this soap, it smells great, it doesn't leave any residual soap film and makes my skin very smooth! It does make you feel little dried out but I follow up with rose water spray which I let it dry and then use the above mentioned oil-based moisturizer. I don't know if this is the product or the other products in my acne regimen, but my pores also shrunk dramatically. I stopped using all expensive acne products and replaced it with the soap, and my skin has gotten better, and is EXTREMELY CLEAR and has a nice supple glow!!Those of you who are suffering from severe cystic/hormonal acne, I know you would want to see the result ASAP, but patience is the key... I saw a \"DRAMATIC\" improvement in my skin within a month. It's been a 2 months now, and people are amazed by how amazing my skin has turned into. I ordered their turmeric soap that i am going to use next, to get rid of remaining of tough scars.It is an expensive soap but I cut it in to 6 small pieces and use 1 at a time to avoid wasting it or develop any bacteria around it. I used 1 piece in a month, so I am anticipating this soap to last for at least 5 months! I just ordered \"Soap Sample Set\" from their actual website which has all different types of soap that they sell. I would highly recommend using this soap for those of you who are in desperate need to rid the acne.Thank you Aspen Kay! Keep up the good work that you do for people, Don't change your formulas EVER! :)",

                "reviewText": "I recently tried the Aspen Kay Naturals Handmade Dead Sea Mud Soap Bar and overall I was pleased with the product. The soap bar had a nice, earthy scent and left my skin feeling clean and refreshed. It also had a nice, creamy lather which I enjoyed. The dead sea mud in the soap is said to be good for the skin and I did notice that my skin felt more hydrated after using it. However, it is a bit pricey, and for the price, I would have liked to see the bar last a bit longer. Overall, it's a good soap bar, but not worth the premium price.",

                "reviewText": "I tried this mud soap bar for over a month now using it every day. I bought it because I wanted something with natural ingredients that would clear up my acne. It's done nothing to clear my complexion whatsoever and I am still breaking out in more spots. It dries the skin out slightly although not as badly as some other bars I have used. Considering it has done nothing for my skin what I wouldn't recommend this, and I'm really surprised that it would get so many positive reviews.",
