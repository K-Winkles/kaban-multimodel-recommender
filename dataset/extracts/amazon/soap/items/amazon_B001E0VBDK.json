                "reviewText": "I have had cracked and bleeding heels on both of my feet for over 5 years. I have been to 2 dermatologists and paid for expensive prescription creams that never completely healed my feet. The eczema started on my feet and fingers and I felt it was a chemical contact dermatitis. I tried to protect my fingers and feet but it was a major inconvenience. Finally, 3 months ago I bought the Nubian Heritage African Black Soap. I was not expecting anything but a natural soap that was NOT full of synthetic chemicals. In the past I had used Dove soap for sensitive skin and Oil of Olay for sensitive skin (which was discontinued).My heels quit bleeding and started healing while on the first bar of soap. The eczema that had started up my calves went away within 2 weeks of using the soap. Then I noticed that the cracked and bleeding on my thumb and forefinger had healed. I never use lotions, as I am lazy and just forget to do it. I had given up on the prescription as I was tired of paying $50 per tube. I did not do anything for my skin during this time. I even went on vacation and was barefoot on the boat, beach and sidewalks. The only thing that could have healed my feet and fingers was the Nubian Heritage african black soap.I switched to Dr Woods black african soap and before I was finished with that bar, my heels started cracking again. So obviously, I switched back to the Nubian Heritage. Within 1 week, my heels were looking much better and I will not switch again.The soap is black and will look black on a white wash cloth but it washes out fine. I also have a white tile shower and it did not stain the tiles. It lathers very well so a little soap goes a long way. I also like the fragrance, mild but pleasant.",

                "reviewText": "It's rare for me to write a product review, but for Nubian Heritage, I will.I've been using Nubian Heritage soaps for almost 15 years off and on. Compared to mass-produced soaps like Ivory, Dial, Coast, etc., I find that these soaps (the various Nubian Heritage soaps) provide a deeper cleansing. I feel more refreshed. It does not dry out the skin, and it certainly does not leave a soapy residue like all these body-wash gels that are glutting the market (I've tried those too). So after comparing with other soaps, I always come back to these products. They may be a bit more expensive then the mass-produced soaps, but it is worth it.I'm glad Amazon sells Nubian Heritage products. Personally, as a Harlem, New York City native I was introduced to these soaps back in the mid-90's when Nubian Heritage was starting up and selling via street vendors in Harlem and other Black neighborhoods throughout NYC; before Amazon (and most of the internet-as-we-know-it) even existed. In Black communities in NYC (and I'm assuming throughout the country-hopefully), these soaps are still often found either being sold in beauty supply stores, or by stand-alone street/mall vendors.For a short time I when I was living in North Carolina, I was wondering if I could find Nubian Heritage anywhere else (before Amazon came around), and just used regular soaps. I say this so that anyone who is interested African Black Soap and cannot find a local store/vendor who sells it, or any other soaps Nubian Heritage offers knows where they can easily get them.Also (I should've added this earlier), you can use this soap knowing that all the ingredients are natural. No undue chemicals, unnecessary perfumes, colognes, etc. added. The scent is soothing, without it smelling like your showering in aftershave.I recommend this to anyone regardless of color, creed, race, persuasion, etc., etc., who just wants a great quality NATURAL bar soap.",

                "reviewText": "I am a black woman with a chocolate complexion. I have oily, slightly sensitive skin. I've been plagued by acne ever since I was a teen and I'm now in my 30's. Throughout this time, I've tried over the counter remedies, proactive, and various other prescription topical creams from the dermotologist (which would only work for a certain length of time). What I've come to realize as an adult woman, is that these chemical \"alternatives\" do not agree with me. Herbs, natural oils, and so forth are grouped under the banner of \"alternative remedies\" but I think this is actually a very backward thinking. After deciding to stop the assault of chemicals on my body and researching and experimenting with various natural remedies, I now see that they are very powerful, effective, and work in harmony with my body chemistry. This item (African Black Soap) from Nubian Heritage combines the clarifying astringent properties of palm ash with the moisturizing, calming, and soothing properties of shea butter and oats. I love it! I still need to moisturize my skin after using it but I expected that. Over time, I've noticed my complexion become more even toned and clear. The smell is delightful and not overpowering at all. I know this may sound a bit loopy but when I use it, I feel connected to ancestors before me. I feel like I'm using something that's not only beautifying my skin but making my skin healthier from the inside out. I would just ask the company to keep the product the way it is and not betray the integrity of the product. If so, I will remain a loyal and recurrent customer.",
