The activated charcoal helps to deeply cleanse and detoxify, leaving my skin feeling refreshed and revitalized. I love how it lathers up nicely and has a pleasant, subtle scent. Plus, it's gentle enough for daily use, and I've noticed a significant improvement in the clarity and smoothness of my skin since I started using it. Overall, I highly recommend this activated charcoal black bar soap for anyone looking to achieve a clearer and healthier complexion. It's a game-changer!",

                "reviewText": "I'm pleased that I was able to find a collection of natural soaps for such a reasonable price. I'm in love with the short ingredients list on the soap sleeves. I used one for the first time today--I picked the Bergamot bar--and was also pleased with the smooth lather it made. It was good enough to shave with, and my skin did not feel dried out after using. (which, yay. bar soaps do that to me more often than not, so I love that these didn't).To nitpick, I'd been under the impression that they were scented with real essential oils, but they are not. The soap sleeve clearly indicates that they are scented with \"parfum\" (perfume). They smell pleasant, but they do smell like perfumed scents (not the real essential oils), and they smell mostly the same (except the lemon and grapefruit). To be fair, this is my misunderstanding, as the Amazon ad in no way indicates that they DO include essential oils. I just happened to click over from another one of their sets that actually does, then didn't bother verifying that this one did, too. To others like me who are sensitive to manufactured scents, though, please take this into account. However, I can't fault the actual product--the soaps are great quality, and I'm sure 98% of people won't care one way or another and will find the scents pleasant, cheerful, and mild.Last note: I love the packaging. They come in a cute little orange box, and the illustrations on the individual soap sleeves are beautiful. I feel like this would make a great gift for someone.",
