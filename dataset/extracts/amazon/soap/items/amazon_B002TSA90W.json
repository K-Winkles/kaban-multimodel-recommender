                "reviewText": "Great, overall... it is soap and we don't think about that too much.I used to get by with the more classic harsh soaps like Dial and Irish Spring.This Dove soap simply is less harsh and better for your skin. I can get flaky so a smoother soap like this has helped a lot. It also smells great but is not fruity or anything. It lathers up really well too. Which also makes it a great hand soap.The charcoal bits are a gimmick for sure and will cause it to run little dark as if you're washing away grease or dirt. It's not really going to reliably exfoliate or anything but it gives a little feedback I guess. It's better to use a wash cloth and/or an exfoliating cloth (Korean thing) anyway.It will totally fall apart if left in a pool of water, so don't do that.We run through these faster than the other soaps I mentioned but nothing extreme. Worth it in my opinion.",

                "reviewText": "I've used a ton of different soaps over my life, bar, and liquid. This has been my go-to and favorite body soap since I first tried it. Each bar has some grit in it for exfoliation and does a great job of cleaning and moisturizing, especially in winter months when it can get very dry in my location (North East US).I've found this not only to work extremely well but is both affordable and each bar tends to last me quite a long time. I also enjoy the scent.Overall, I've continued to come back and purchase this whenever I'm running low and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. One of the best name-brand bar soap I've used in my life; smells great, cleans, moisturizes, exfoliates, and each bar goes a long way. I'll continue to keep stock of this and certainly recommend it.",

I don't use this on my face (I use sanex zero). This smells so good, you could open up a bar, and the room will smell of the soap.Great cleaning soap, great smell, and great for cleaning up after manual working jobs.",
