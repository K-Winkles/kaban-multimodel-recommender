                "reviewText": "In the warmer months, I like to keep up with shaving my legs and often do a quick round in the shower every morning. Shaving cream/gel is a process because it takes some extra time to cover the legs and then you have to rinse your razor several times, so it takes up precious time in the morning. I started to use regular soap in the shower and found that it kind of worked, but I needed a soap that was more emollient, and I was hoping for a nice, but not overpowering, scent.I tried a couple of different soaps labeled specifically as 'shave' soaps, and one was quite nice but didn't last long and was almost $9 a bar (Kitsch Smoothing Shave Butter: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BV841TJ2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1, and another (Van Der Hagen Men's Luxury Scented Shave Soap: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004L4AMIG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) was more reasonably priced but had such a strong, overpowering scent that I literally tasted it and that was super disgusting.I came upon this soap when doing a search for soap with shea butter (for the emollients) and it was so reasonably priced that it was worth the experiment. I bought the \"shea buttermilk\" version and when I unpackaged it, the smell was fairly strong. It wasn't unpleasant, but I was worried that I'd end up hating it because of overpowering smell. Thankfully it didn't last or linger much past that first night, so it became a non-issue. I obviously smell it when I'm using it in the shower, but it's not super strong and the scent doesn't last or carry through with me into the day, so it's no problem. I then bought the \"cocoa butter\" version, which didn't arrive with that same strong smell and smells even more pleasant, so that's my new go-to.The soap lasts a good long while. I have used it for countless leg shaves at this point, and the first bar is still going strong. It lasts way longer than the Kitsch Smoothing Shave Butter, which smells nice but is $9 a bar! And it doesn't have the insanely overpowering smell I found with the Van Der Hagen Men's Luxury Scented Shave Soap.I'd say that this Yardley's soap would be great as a straight-up soap for anyone who wants an emollient soap with a scent. And I'd highly recommend it for anyone looking to use soap to facilitate quick shaves in the shower. Smells good, works well, and is very reasonably priced!",

I had to change to Dove Shea Butter Soap when my skin became dryer, so I've been buying 2 different soaps for a couple years. When the discontinued Tone, I scrambled to find a replacement and found this one. We love it! I'm dropping the Dove and am back to 1 kind of soap to purchase again...yay!! It smells stronger than Tone but we've all adjusted easily. It lathers really well, is moisturizing but not greasy and rinses off cleanly. I have sensitive dry skin and it is working out really well...no itching! Hope they continue making their line of bar soaps, much more environmentally friendly than all of the chemicals and plastics in the body washes. Stores better, too!(P.S. The oatmeal soap is a good one too.)",

                "reviewText": "It doesn't really smell like shea butter, but the scent isn't unpleasant. It cleans and rinses off well. I bought this on the recommendation of my friend because she said to try shea butter soap to moisturize my skin. It gets dry in the winter. Unfortunately, this soap doesn't really moisturize, and my skin is still dry. I think it may actually be more dry than it was before I tried this soap, but I think that's because the soap I was using before was better at moisturizing more than anything else.This soap is definitely great for sensitive skin. I'm VERY prone to blemishes, and it's a constant struggle, so I have to be careful about what I use on my skin. This soap actually cleared up my skin, and I haven't had any new blemishes appear. I was pleasantly surprised. Even though it doesn't moisturize my skin like I want, clearing up my skin like it did is something I appreciate so much that I'm going to continue using it. I'll just be sure to apply lotion after I shower.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this soap because it claims to have Cocoa Butter and Shea Butter in it, which it does. However, if you look at the ingredients list both of those come AFTER the perfume portion. This means it has more perfume than either of these ingredients.I used it and my skin actually feels very dry compared to my last soap, so it doesn't seem to do much in regards to moisturizing your skin. Considering it has more perfume than moisturizer I am not surprised.At this point I'm thinking I might just take the loss and toss this bar in the can. I mean, I can use any old cheap soap if I want my skin to be dry, so why not order something where I get three bars for the price I paid for only one of these.I do not recommend this, especially if you already have dry skin. Also, I don't like the smell either. It is too strong and lingers way too long.",

It retains it\u2019s solidity perfectly and does not go soft and slimy like numerous other soaps I have used. Also very long lasting. I normally use liquid soaps but won\u2019t be in future. Have just ordered two further tablets in the Lavender fragrance and will certainly be using more in the future. Cannot recommend highly enough.",
