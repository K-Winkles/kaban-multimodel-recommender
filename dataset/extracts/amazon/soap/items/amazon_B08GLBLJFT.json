I used it when hand washing a load of panties and discovered not only does it resolve stains and odors, but also has a fresh, clean scent. I decided to add a little bit to a regular load of laundry in my washer and it worked just as great! Be careful not to put too big of a slice in with your clothes so that it dissolves.",
