                "reviewText": "Let me tell you something there are many products which have let me down over the years from Neutrogena to Nivea even the soaps sold in mom stores like Avon. The only thing that has ever really helped me with my skin issues are aloe soaps and drinking huge quantities of water. I've been hearing about black soap for about a decade now but I never really made the effort to find it and purchase it. Now as a bearded man my face is prone to ingrown hair and huge razor bumps at a time which have caused hair to grow in patches. I said there has to be something out there that can help me with this because the aloe soap, shea butter body wash, beard wash and lavender soap was not doing it. I decided to give this soap a try after much research because regular African black soap has a reputation on its own and so does Shea so I said both of them combined something has to work. I received this product on Friday April 13th and today on April 17th I can truly say to you all the razor bumps and rough skin on my face that I was use to is cleared up. It does not leave the skin irritated, ashy, cracked or dry but it leaves it with a nice smooth and oily finish. The soap allows new growth to grow in as well as give you a nice organic cocoa and shea smell. THIS SOAP HYDRATES, EXFOLIATES, CLEARS UP AND MOISTURIZES all in one. If you purchase go ahead and purchase 2 and make sure you don't run through it quickly.",

                "reviewText": "I switched over to this soap when I was coming off a really bad full-body contact dermatitis rash. Before using this soap, I was using Dove and when I got out of the shower, the calamine lotion had been washed off and I needed to reapply immediately. After using this soap, I'm not sure if it was because the calamine lotion was still there or because the black soap offered itch relief but I could go over halfway through my day without reapplying calamine lotion.I am a male and the scent smells awesome. I would not describe it as masculine or feminine. Unfortunately, it doesn't stick around long after the shower.I am also Black. Before using this soap, if I didn't use lotion, I would be ashy all day. With this soap, I don't need lotion. My skin isn't as moisturized as it is when I use lotion but it isn't ashy either and that's all that I care about.It lathers up really good.It seems to last a while considering the size. I'm about halfway through and I've been using it once or twice a day for 2 weeks. This isn't a very large bar of soap. If you are comparing this to a big box brand like Irish Springs, it's a pretty small bar of soap for 5 bucks. You can probably get three irish springs bars that are almost twice as big for the same price. But when you factor in quality, I think it's worth it and I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "Let me just say this stuff is awesome. I suffer from HS and cystic acne. I also get hormonal break outs on my face and large painful cysts. I have tried so many products. I use this on my face every time I shower and all over my body especially areas that are prone to HS flares such as my underarms and inner thighs. My scars are starting to heal and the dark areas are starting to lighten. My face is the clearest I've seen it in years and I currently have zero, active cystic lesions. This hasn't happened since I was a teen and even then my face was oily and broken out. I will admit the smell is different, not bad just smells medicinal and it does slightly dry my skin. But considering that I can wear a lightweight moisturizer and the scent is minimal, I couldn't expect more from this product. I am sold, 100%. I am so very grateful to have found something that provides me relief from HS as well as being affordable and is only an extra step to my shower routine. I'm over the moon!!! Hope it helps someone else as much as it has helped me!",

I also have acne on my back that has kept me from so many experiences like a pool or beach day and issues with intimacy. I have literally tried everything. I finally am under a dermatolgist care and my acne has subsided not ended. I saw the Makeup Guru Mykala on TikTok rave about this soap. Let me tell you, I'm almost in tears, it works so well. I have been using it for about 2 weeks and can see a HUGE improvement on my face and back. This is a dying soap (I'm dry but have not experienced peeling like other soaps or medications). Please use moisturizer.Truly so happy and honestly grateful.For reference I am on spiralatone and perviously on minocycline. The products my derm put me on are the posey line. This soap works better than that. I still use the posey moisturizer.Keywords:AcneBacnePCOSSpiralatoneMinocycline",
