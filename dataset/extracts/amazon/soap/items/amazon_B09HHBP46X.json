It seems very runny and almost like it is watered-down \u2014 not like most of the other antibacterial soaps I\u2019ve gotten in the past.The scent is nice, and it eventually lathers up well, but as a consequence of how watery it is, I also feel I need to use two pumps of soap to get the same clean as I did with one pump of other products.While I would like to think this funniness is a fluke, I don\u2019t think this thickness issue is only affecting my one bottle; I therefore do not think I will purchase it again, and will instead go back to a slightly more expensive soap that I do not have to use as much of at one time.",

                "reviewText": "In my girlfriend's home, the Amazon Basics Liquid Hand Soap has secured a special place, primarily in her kitchen and bathroom, where it seamlessly complements her soap dispensers. With its generous 50-fluid ounce pack, she can enjoy extended periods without the worry of running out of soap. This not only provides peace of mind but also trims down her visits to the supermarket or Walgreens.What sets this hand soap apart extends beyond practicality; it's also the delightful citrus scent that bestows a touch of luxury upon her daily routine. Each time she indulges in handwashing, a mild and pleasant fragrance enhances the experience. Moreover, this soap goes the extra mile by offering moisturizing support to her skin, leaving it soft, smooth, and becoming an integral part of her skincare regimen.As for the triclosan-free formula, I admit the term was unfamiliar to me before this purchase. Delving deeper, I found that triclosan is an antibacterial and antifungal agent present in some consumer products, including soap. While its effectiveness as an antimicrobial agent remains controversial, concerns revolve around the risks of antimicrobial resistance and its potential effects on hormonal development. Research also explores its impact on organisms and environmental health. Though the intricacies might not be entirely clear, we both appreciate the mounting environmental and safety concerns surrounding household products. Knowing that this soap is free from triclosan aligns perfectly with our commitment to safer, eco-friendly choices. It's a small yet meaningful stride toward a cleaner and greener home.Having used this product for a considerable duration, it has become a staple in her kitchen and bathroom. Not only does it uphold cleanliness, but it also contributes to a more environmentally responsible household. The Amazon Basics Liquid Hand Soap seamlessly blends value, a refreshing citrus scent, and an eco-conscious approach, making it a perfect addition to her daily routine and during my visits.",
