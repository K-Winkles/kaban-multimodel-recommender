                "reviewText": "Basically method is a company you most likely can trust their quality. And I got the foam hand soap at a discount. I've tried their sea mineral flavor before from department store purchases so I'm not surprised at all with what I received.For those who's also transferring from regular hand soap to foaming hand soap, below are some of my feelings:1. the liquid content inside a foaming hand soap bottle feels more watery. while in contrast regular hand soap will be more sticky2. this foaming soap's foam itself is more \"flat\" than some other foaming hand soap you may have used (see picture 2 where the foam flattens on my hand). Don't be surprised if it turned out to be like that. Not very foamy.3. but it still washes well and smells nice.I got a package of 6 at a pretty discounted price from amazon. Therefore I've nothing to complain!Update: after two days of usage the foam from each pump increased. I guess how fully the tubes are filled also affects the foam production. Don\u2019t get surprised if the first few pumps don\u2019t give enough foams.",

I feel like it otherwise leaves a tiny bit of some sort of cleaning or hydration agent that you can feel on your dry hands.The bottles came undamaged; no leakage occurred.The real reason why I bought these is because they're the cheapest way to get a few refillable foaming soap bottles, whilst also getting some product with it. Empty foaming soap dispensers are crazy expensive on Amazon! I bought these with a huge jug of refillable foaming soap and I anticipate that these will be great for them.",
