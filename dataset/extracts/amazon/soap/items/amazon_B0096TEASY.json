Old School!\u00a8 Let me tell you something - the lovely elderly women in your family had it right!Pears is amazing! And yes, I'm talking to my fellow Instagrammers, YouTubers and TikTokers. When it comes to facial cleansers, you don't need the high-priced facial cleansers from Sephora or Ulta. Pears is not just as good, but better! Simple ingredients like glycerine to add moisture and glow, lathers beautifully and leaves your face feeling super soft without feeling tight and, at a fraction of what those \u00a8influencer cleanser of the month\u00a8 must-haves cost!Also, if you have sensitive skin, Pears will give you the foam you long for while also gently and thoroughly cleansing your face. You'll love the way your face feels so much, you'll use it for the rest of your body as well. One bar lasts a very long time.And, if having a super cute looking vanity or bathroom counter is your thing (like me,) then you'll be love the oval shape and translucent amber glow of this soap! Get an adorable porcelain soap dish from Ebay or Etsy and you're good to go. Classy AND cute!Stop being \u00a8influenced\u00a8 into purchasing facial cleansers that cost more than a tiny Gucci purse! Save your $$$ and THEN you can get that Gucci - if you absolutely have to.",
