It lathers very well, has a decent scent, and best of all it is not made by Unilever. Dial soap is much cheaper than Unilever products and it is just as good. This soap does not leave a film in one shower or tub. I recommend it.",

But it smells good on your body and the deodorant element works.Also, Dial started scooping out 20% of the bar many years ago. from the top it looks like a full sized bar. Flip it over and it is concave. If they could make a hollow bar of soap I am certain they would. It is misleading and outright theft but I like the scent so I buy it anyway.",
