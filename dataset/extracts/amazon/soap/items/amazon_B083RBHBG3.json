Personally I just use it for my face and beard so it lasts a long time. All natural ingredients and essential oils. My skin and beard feel great. Not overly dry and not oily at all. Best stuff I've found yet and I've tried a ton of products. No residue or dry skin in beard at all. Very high quality. Most of the scents are amazing. There's 1 or 2 I wasn't as big a fan of but they were still good. Can't remember which. The new Coconut Castaway is very good. Love the pine tar one. Honestly they're all really good. 10 pack is by far the best deal. If you're looking for some great soap you've found it. Highly recommend.",

More eco-friends, no plastic waste and it\u2019s literally better than anything you can find in store. Smells amazing and it\u2019s incredible for sensitive skin. If you have dry skin, guarantee your body wash is a good place to start.The only cons in my opinion are1) They don\u2019t sell 6 packs of the golden moss scent2) The sage scent smells my drywall dust. Buy any combo pack that does not contain it. It\u2019s really that bad.",

I\u2019m pretty sensitive to smells and a lot of men\u2019s soap is overpowering for me, but this stuff is perfect. It\u2019s super fragrant but not chemically and smacking you in the face. They all smell very fresh, I think there was maybe one soap I\u2019ve smelled out of the 15+ we have used over the years that I don\u2019t like, and it was only because it was a super manly smell that just wasn\u2019t my cup of tea. It was still a good smell and I could see how others would enjoy it. Bottom line is this soap is awesome!! Please make a line of scents for women!!!!! PLEAAAASE!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Hey, guys. In June of 2022, I set out on a mission to find an economical, all natural soap for men. I tried over 20 sets of soaps. If you\u2019re interested in reading a comprehensive review of these soaps, look up my review under Crate 61-For Him. Then come back to this review to read more about Dr. Squatch.PricingBefore I begin, you should know that I scratched Dr. Squatch from my list because it didn\u2019t meet my price requirement ($1.00/ounce or less). Dr. Squatch is not an economical soap; however, given its popularity, and given that it was one of the only soaps that met my strict definition of all natural, I wanted to post a review.Since Dr. Squatch is one of the pricier men\u2019s soaps posted on Amazon, let\u2019s be upfront about what you\u2019re going to pay for this soap. If you decide that it\u2019s too expensive for you, I provide many affordable alternatives in my review for Crate 61-For Him. By the way, Crate 61 ended up being my #1 choice for an all natural soap brand. I evaluated over 10 brands of soap; eight met my price requirement. However, in terms of being all natural, only Crate 61, Varina, and Dr. Squatch qualified by my strict definition. At the time of purchase, Crate 61 cost $0.83/ounce, as compared to $1.26/ounce for Dr. Squatch (10-pack).You can buy Dr. Squatch soap by the bar, in a three-pack of a single flavor, in a five-pack of a single flavor, or in variety packs of four, five, or ten flavors. You can also purchase the soap bars in combination packs that include other products (e.g., with deodorants in the same flavors as the soaps). There are so many listings for this soap on Amazon that I couldn\u2019t possibly look at all of them, so the following information is provided just to give you an idea of how the price can vary. I suggest that you explore Amazon and look for the best price.PRICING INFORMATION UPDATED AS OF 7/14/23Single Flavors\u2022 Single pack: $11.49-$24.95 ($2.30-$4.99/ounce)\u2022 Three-pack: $29.21-$32.45 ($1.95-$2.16/ounce)\u2022 Five-pack: $46.45 ($1.86/ounce)Variety Packs\u2022 Four-pack: $39.95 ($2.00/ounce)\u2022 Five-pack: $46.45 ($1.86/ounce)\u2022 Ten-pack: $62.46-$74.95 ($1.25-$1.50/ounce)Just to give you an idea, the soaps that I bought for my study of economical, all natural men\u2019s soaps cost me between $0.71 and $1.06/ounce (at the time of purchase). I took advantage of a sale and bought a Dr. Squatch 10-pack when it was on sale for $1.12/ounce so that I could evaluate it. For reference, the set I purchased would cost me $74.95 today ($1.50/ounce).If you read the questions posted for Dr. Squatch on Amazon, a common question goes something like this, \u201cWhy does Dr. Squatch soap cost so much?\u201d And the response, in turn, goes something like this, \u201cWhat you pay for a product is a personal choice.\u201d In other words, if you want to pay the price, you will pay the price; and, if you don\u2019t, you won\u2019t. The sentiment seems to be, \u201cNobody is forcing you to pay this price.\u201dThe response, while true, presents a rather cold line of logic, and I\u2019d respond to Dr. Squatch as follows. Soap is basically saponified oil. I\u2019m probably oversimplifying things here, but I\u2019m not an expert soap maker: Through the process of saponification, oil and lye are combined to produce soap. Everything else is just icing on the cake. For example, producers often add shea butter to make the soap better for the skin.Now I\u2019m going to give you a bit of homework. Compare the ingredients of Crate 61 soaps with the ingredients of Dr. Squatch soaps. You will find that they are quite similar. Then exercise your freedom of choice and decide if you\u2019d rather pay $0.83/ounce for Crate 61 or between $1.25 and $4.99 an ounce for Dr. Squatch. If you still decide to purchase Dr. Squatch, \"Nobody is forcing you to pay 2-6 times as much for a similar product!\"Aside from my issue with the price, if you\u2019re willing to pay it, Dr. Squatch is a good soap. Read on to learn more.The BasicsHere are some basic stats on Dr. Squatch (UPDATED AS OF 7/14/23). This brand offers an incredible number of purchase options, so the following is specifically for the 10 Bar Set 3 listing, which is the one that I bought for my study.\u2022 Price/pack: $74.95\u2022 Soaps/pack: 10\u2022 Ounces/bar: 5 ounces\u2022 Price/bar: $7.50 (Since soaps come in all sizes, you should really look at the price/ounce to compare different soap brands.)\u2022 Price/ounce: $1.50 (This is about 50% greater than my $1.00/ounce max for my study.)\u2022 Scents (my descriptors): Masculine, Earthy, Fruity, and Fresh\u2022 4-5 Star Rating: 93% (Combines the percentage of people giving the soap a four- or five-star rating. I only considered soaps that rated over 80% on this criterion.)\u2022 # Ratings: 7,466 (The total number of ratings received. I only considered soaps with hundreds of ratings.)The number of ratings is for the 10-pack set that I purchased. If, however, you look at the five-pack sets, some have over 20,000 ratings, which shows that Dr. Squatch is a popular brand of men\u2019s soaps.What is natural?In my review for Crate 61-For Him, I explain in detail my definition of \u201call natural.\u201d In a nutshell, an all natural soap should contain essential oils, other natural ingredients like shea butter, and nothing else. No additives, no fragrances, no micas, no colorants, and, of course, no unpronounceable chemicals. I stand to be corrected, but, by this definition, I believe that the only soaps in my study that would make the cut are Crate 61, Varina, and Dr. Squatch. All others would fail on one account or another.You\u2019ll have to decide what you\u2019re willing to live with; for, if you use the same strict definition that I do, you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find many options.UPDATE (7/14/23): Since I first posted this review, I've had an opportunity to test a few more brands that I would consider 100% all natural. The one that seems to be the closest match to Dr. Squatch is Varina. This brand offers an equally dizzying array of purchase options. For comparison, the 10-bar Varina set for men that I purchased (Mens 2 Variety) cost $44.99 ($1.00/ounce). I highly recommend that Dr. Squatch fans try this brand and compare the two. In short, I preferred Varina because it's less expensive, higher in quality, more fragrant, and better for your skin. Compare the two and decide for yourself.More on Dr. Squatch 10 Bar Set 3One of the things that I appreciated about Dr. Squatch is that it takes away the guesswork of looking for a soap that would appeal to men, for 100% of their soaps are for men. Of course, whether a scent is appealing or not is very much a question of personal taste. There\u2019s nothing I could write that could tell you if you would like a particular scent or not. You just have to try it. Fortunately, shopping for Dr. Squatch soaps is like going into a Baskin Robbins Ice Cream shop. There are so many flavors that you\u2019re bound to find one that you like!Here's how I would group the soaps in the set that I bought:\u2022 Earthy: Eucalyptus Greek Yogurt*, Pine Tar*, Alpine Sage, and Spearmint Basil*\u2022 Fruity: Grapefruit IPA*\u2022 Fresh: Cool Fresh Aloe\u2022 Combination Bars: Cedar Citrus* (could have gone in Earthy or Fruity category as well)\u2022 Neutral (very mild scent): Deep Sea Goat\u2019s Milk, Bay Rum, Gold Moss*These were some of my favorite scents. One of the fun things about trying out different soaps is that you\u2019ll discover what you like and what you don\u2019t. For example, I clearly prefer earthy, minty, and fruity scents (particularly those of the citrus variety). On the other hand, others might prefer fresh-smelling soaps or soaps with a more neutral scent. You\u2019ll have to figure this out for yourself.Overall, the scents of Dr. Squatch soaps are mild, so you don\u2019t have to worry about your partner or co-workers finding the scents overpowering or offensive. I tried soap brands that resulted in others having a very definite negative reaction to the scents; thus, if you have a partner, it might be good to get their reaction. You become blind to how you smell, so getting a second opinion is always a good idea. If, on the other hand, you think you might prefer stronger scents, I offer some suggestions in another section.A Word on GritKudos to Dr. Squatch for listing how much grit is in each soap. This is something that I\u2019ve seen few brands do. The grit helps to exfoliate your skin; however, some men like grit and some men don\u2019t. Dr. Squatch soaps may have zero, medium, or heavy grit. Personally, I didn\u2019t mind the grit even in the soap with heavy grit, but you\u2019ll have to see if you like it or not.If you explore reviews of other brands on Amazon, some people have been injured (scratched or cut) by the exfoliating ingredients in natural soaps. I don\u2019t think this is a concern with Dr. Squatch, for it seems like the grit is refined enough that this isn\u2019t a danger. In any case, be cautious and use a gentle touch with the soaps with grit until you find the amount of pressure that feels good to you. Of course, examine your body in the mirror after your shower to make sure that the grit hasn\u2019t caused any cuts or scratches, for you won\u2019t necessarily feel it if you get scratched.In the following sections, I compare Dr. Squatch to other soaps and brands. As I share this information, remember that these rankings are subjective and represent my preferences. Your preferences might be very different. As I go along, I\u2019ll try and explain why you might rank Dr. Squatch higher or lower.Dr. Squatch Versus Sets of Other Brands (RATINGS UPDATED 7/14/23)Here\u2019s how Dr. Squatch stacks up to other sets of soap that I tried. Herein I include sets that weren\u2019t marketed specifically to men but, in my opinion, are quite appropriate for men. I would recommend any of the sets on this list, and I would rebuy any of these with pleasure.1. Age of Sage-Masculine (87%)2. Varina (87%)3. 360 Feel-Men\u2019s (84%)4. Crate 61-Citrus (83%)5. Crate 61-For Him (83%)6. Age of Sage-Fruity (81%)7. Crate 61-Popular (81%)8. Crate 61-Dry Skin (80%)9. Dr. Squatch (79%)10. Age of Sage-Galactic (79%)11. Age of Sage-Macho (77%)12. 360 Feel-Fresh (77%)I prefer strong, bold scents that are earthy or fruity, and my rankings reflect this. Dr. Squatch\u2019s scents are mild. If you prefer mild scents, you may well have ranked Dr. Squatch higher on this list.Here\u2019s some general advice:\u2022 If you prefer earthy scents that are strong and bold, try Age of Sage-Masculine or Varina.\u2022 If you prefer earthy and fruity scents that are moderate, try 360 Feel-Men\u2019s.\u2022 If you prefer earthy and fruity scents that are mild-moderate, try Crate 61-For Him.\u2022 If you prefer earthy and fruity scents that are mild, try Dr. Squatch.\u2022 If you prefer fresh scents, Age of Sage-Macho and 360 Feel-Fresh are your best options.\u2022 If you have sensitive skin or don\u2019t like scented soaps, Crate 61-Dry Skin is an excellent option.Dr. Squatch Versus Sets of Other Brands for Men (RATINGS UPDATED 7/14/23)Here\u2019s how Dr. Squatch stacks up to other sets marketed to men. Dr. Squatch took fifth place. Seventy-five percent was my cutoff for sets that I would rebuy.1. Age of Sage-Masculine (87%)2. Varina-Men's Set (87%)3. 360 Feel-Men\u2019s (84%)4. Crate 61-For Him (83%)5. Dr. Squatch (79%)6. Age of Sage-Macho (77%)7. Bali-Men\u2019s (74%)8. Purelis-Men\u2019s (73%)9. Natural American-Soldier (72%)10. Natural American-Elements (71%)Again, you may well have ranked Dr. Squatch higher if you prefer milder scents. If you prefer bolder scents, you\u2019d probably agree with my rankings.Dr. Squatch Versus Other Brands (RATINGS UPDATED 7/14/23)Here\u2019s how Dr. Squatch stacks up as a brand. Again, 75% was my cutoff for brands I would rebuy.1. Crate 61 (82%)2. Varina (82%)3. Dr. Squatch (82%)4. Age of Sage (81%)5. 360 Feel (80%)6. Bali (74%)7. Dr. Bronner (73%)8. Purelis (73%)9. Natural American (71%)On this list, the rankings reflect my preference for a 100% all natural soap. Only three brands, Crate 61, Varina, and Dr. Squatch met my strict requirement for all natural. (For more on this topic, see my review for Crate 61-For Him.) All three are an excellent choice, but here's how I would distinguish them:1. Crate 61: Best overall value. Highly popular brand with strong reputation.2. Varina: New brand. Similar to Dr. Squatch but more economical, more fragrant, and more moisturizing.3. Dr. Squatch: Most expensive. Well established brand. Highly popular. Mild scents.Strengths and Weaknesses of Dr. SquatchHere are the strengths of Dr. Squatch:\u2022 Met my strict definition of all natural! Honest ingredients!\u2022 Extensive assortment of flavors \u2026 all for men!\u2022 Lists the grit factor on the box (zero, medium, and heavy).The first factor is the most important one to me. It\u2019s why I spent six months testing over 10 brands of soap and over 20 sets of soap.Here are the weaknesses of Dr. Squatch:\u2022 It is one of the most expensive all natural soaps for men that you can buy. The price/bar for the single bar ranges from $11-$25. They really gouge you if you buy it individually rather than in a pack.\u2022 Since my study focused on men\u2019s soaps in the lower price bracket, I didn\u2019t compare Dr. Squatch to other expensive men\u2019s soaps. However, I invite you to explore the reviews on Amazon. Some state that, with Dr. Squatch, you\u2019re paying for the brand and that there are better men\u2019s soaps in its price range.\u2022 The scents are weak. This could be an advantage if you prefer weak scents, but I prefer moderate to strong scents.Would I Buy Dr. Squatch Soaps Again?I would only buy them again if they were on sale. Dr. Squatch gets kudos for being truly all natural; thus, even though it\u2019s pricier, I might buy it again if the price were right.My Recommendations for Dr. Squatch\u2022 Lower the price! At least use more honest pricing with the single packs. There\u2019s no excuse for charging more than double for a single bar versus the packs! This is price gouging!\u2022 I liked the variety packs, but you have so many flavors in your collection that you could probably afford to sell them in variety packs that are themed. Here are some ideas:o Fruity/Citrus Packo Earthy/Woodsy Packo Unscented/Sensitive Skin Packo Fresh Scent Pack\u2022 You could probably repackage these very same soaps and sell them to women under another brand name. I would guess that the following would probably appeal to women:o Fruity/citrus soapso Fresh scent soapso Unscented soaps/soaps for sensitive skinTo end on a positive note, I congratulate Dr. Squatch for being a truly all natural soap. Read your labels! Many soaps claim to be all natural; but, when you read the list of ingredients, you find all kinds of unexpected surprises!Want More?Look for my individual reviews of these soaps:\u2022 360 Feel-Men\u2019s\u2022 Age of Sage-Masculine\u2022 Bali-Men\u2019s\u2022 Crate 61-For Him\u2022 Dr. Bronner (8-pack variety set)\u2022 Dr. Squatch (10-bar, Set 3) (this review)\u2022 Natural American-Soldier\u2022 Purelis-Men\u2019sCOMING SOON: Look for reviews on Varina, Verdacura, Fabulous Frannie, and Aurial.Extra for ExpertsI\u2019m going to end each of my reviews with a different tip. These are lessons that I learned along the way. I hope these tips will help you as you continue your journey to find the perfect soap for you!Tip #3Look for soaps with honest scents and ingredients.An honest scent is one that is clearly identifiable by the name of the soap and its ingredients. Dr. Squatch qualifies in this regard. What you read is what you get. Here\u2019s an example. If I try the Eucalyptus Greek Yogurt soap, I expect to smell hints of eucalyptus in the soap, and I expect to see eucalyptus and Greek yogurt in the ingredients. Indeed, here\u2019s the list of ingredients for that soap:Olive oil, sustainable palm oil, coconut oil, GREEK YOGURT, shea butter, EUCALYPTUS essential oil, oatmeal, kaolin clay, and sea salt.To be sincere, I don\u2019t know what Greek yogurt is supposed to smell like (or if it even has a scent); however, if it does, the Greek yogurt in the ingredients will contribute to the scent of the soap. I know what eucalyptus smells like; eucalyptus is listed in the ingredients; and I could smell the eucalyptus in the soap! Life is good!Now let\u2019s look at a counterexample. Age of Sage-Macho, for example, includes a soap called Mountain Air in that set. Do you know what Mountain Air is supposed to smell like? I don\u2019t! Here\u2019s a list of the ingredients for that soap:Coconut oil, canola oil, soybean oil, shea butter, water, sodium hydroxide (lye), olive pomace oil, sunflower oil, and fragrance.Just a quick side note: Some manufacturers list lye in the ingredients; others don\u2019t. Either way, rest assured: lye is used to make soap, but there\u2019s no lye in the final product.I\u2019m being a little tongue-in-cheek here, but I see neither MOUNTAINS nor AIR in the ingredients. What I do see is fragrance, and this fragrance gives the soap a fresh, clean scent. This is a common practice by many soaps manufacturers that annoys me to no end! What exactly did you add to the soap to give it its scent? I want to know because it may make a difference to me.In my view, an all natural soap should derive its scent, not from some generic and unspecified fragrance, but from the essential oils (or other ingredients) that it contains. Dr. Squatch\u2019s Eucalyptus Greek Yogurt soap, as you might expect, contains both eucalyptus and Greek yogurt, and it smells like eucalyptus. On the other hand, I have no idea what Age of Sage-Macho added to its soap to give it its scent, and I have no idea what Mountain Air is supposed to smell like. If you buy it, you are gambling on whether you\u2019ll like it because you don\u2019t know what to expect based on its name or its ingredients.In sum, this may not be an issue for others, but it really pushes my buttons whenever I see \u201cfragrance\u201d in the ingredients, and this is reflected in my rankings. Brands for which there is a clear correlation between the ingredients, the name of the soap, and the scent score higher in my book.In the end, three brands qualified as being 100% all natural and having honest scents and ingredients: Crate 61, Varina, and Dr. Squatch. Thus, if honest scents and ingredients are important to you, give these brands a try.A Final NoteNow go out there and find the soap that\u2019s right for you!",
