While it fights off germs, it also creates a healthier environment for your skin overall, which is important for longterm health. Lavender Oil Lavender oil is an essential oil derived from flowers of the lavender plant. Research shows that it has protective skin benefits and helps reduce inflammation. Activated Charcoal Researchers have found that activated charcoal can draw germs, chemicals, dirt, and other micro-particles to the surface of the skin, making it easier to remove them from your body.

Wash up before, during, and after your gym visit to prevent issues. Washing your hands makes a bigger difference than you probably thought possible. It not only keeps your hands clean, it keeps the overall environment clean. This should go without saying, but if you have a skin issue, don\u2019t train. Covering it up doesn\u2019t count - keep everyone safe by waiting until you are all clear. Make sure any cuts are covered before you hit the gym to reduce the chance of skin trouble.",

                "reviewText": "I just tried this soap, and it is a WONDERFUL! This is great for those who don't want to use soaps with chemicals but still feel clean and protected. I have discovered being diabetic, that, skincare needs change. I get acne now, and I'm almost 60! I break out so easily and my go to soaps don't seem to work for me anymore. And the smell: let me tell you, it makes the bathroom smell naturally nice and that was before I used it. Honestly, I really like the herbal fresh scent and I can still smell it after I get out of the shower. It smells like homemade herbal soap. I have made soap from scratch in the past and this soap is special. For those who cannot smell it after they use it, they may be a little nose blind, because this is a scented soap. I could smell it outside the bathroom door after the shower. It's really pleasant. I will definitely buy again and stock up when I can afford to. It's a great minimalist soap for someone who doesn't want to wear perfume or cologne, but they want to smell nice. It's a great unisex soap. My son didn't like the smell but that only means it will be there waiting for me when I need it. Thank you SPAR! \u263a",

                "reviewText": "Bought this to wash a bacterial wound while healing. Some itchiness and lite burning sensation was present. Hoped the tree tea oil in addition to other advertised components would help reducing the symptoms, unfortunately did not. The soap does lather well, has a good scent, but not much of a calming or soothing effect as expected. Still giving it a high rating as it does have a good cleaning effect.",

                "reviewText": "I chose to buy Spar because it was a bit less expensive than Defense. It is my guess that the folks at Spar were able to save money by using a mold for producing their soap that is totally angular. So that resulting shape may take a bit getting use to until the bar \"wears down\" to a more rounded shape. Just something to be aware of. The most important thing is the effectiveness of the product. And Spar seems to be effective from my experience.",

                "reviewText": "SPAR soap has proven to be just as effective as Defense for my wrestler. He prefers the SPAR scent and these are 3 generously sized bars of soap and a value comparatively. My son would like to see this available in a travel size to more easily take to away meets and to keep in his school athletic locker, but we managed to cut these bars in half and in thirds to fit more easily into travel soap containers. He is on bar #4 bar so far this season and we'll buy again as needed for off season training.",

So I buy the soaps in packages of 3, and my only complaint is that the packaging for the 3 pack is absolutely terrible. I\u2019ve bought two three packs so far and both of them I had to use duct tape so the soap doesn\u2019t fall out the bottom of the box. I\u2019m only giving three stars due to the poor packaging, otherwise it\u2019s a 5!",
