One of them had broken pusher valve probably due to a serious jolt sometime during shipping and had leaked during shipping.Method ships these in inadequate boxes that allows the dispensers to bounce around and damage each other. Until Method changes their packaging this will continue to happen.I will keep this shipment becaue I can simply refill the one that is undamaged.",

While it is possible to use the pump in this condition, it will leak out the soap from the top during each use and create a mess and will not allow the user to use all of the soap throughout the product lifespan.",

It wreaks of bad cologne, I have asked several guests and family members their opinion and all say it\u2019s terrible. If you like bad smelling cologne this is the stuff, otherwise stick to a different scent. I even tried completely washing it out and putting in a different type of soap, and it still smelled like the old terrible smelling soap.",
