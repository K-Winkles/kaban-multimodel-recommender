I've tried a ton of soaps in the last few years and found that peppermint is just the best overall. You get a nice squeaky clean, minty fresh feel, and if there's some tea tree in there, extra great for skin.I wanted a cheaper alternative to my preferred brand as they've doubled in price. So I tried these. They smelled GREAT. Same minty fresh action as any other mint soap. But they used up so super fast. A bar barely lasted a week. One of them was done in four days. So for that reason, I won't be repurchasing but biting the bullet and paying the beefier price for my favorite brand.These would make a nice stocking stuffer type of gift at least. And they may last longer as hand soaps.",
