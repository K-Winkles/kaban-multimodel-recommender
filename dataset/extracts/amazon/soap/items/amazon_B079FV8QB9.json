I wash my hands around 10-20 times a day with most being at 20 seconds, before and after I eat. I also made it a habit to wash my hands if I touch a common area. This is because I have roommates with children and it's flu/cold season. So you would think my hands would get pretty dry with all this washing but they're actually not and I'm not sick either! I also don't need to apply hand lotion as often as I would need with another soap brand.My only con is the condition of the products upon arrival. One of the bottles leaked and the other has a cracked spout so I would need to transfer them to another bottle that is safe to use. Other than that, it's the best bang for your buck!",

Normally I get the foaming kind, so this soap you do have to lather it up to foam yourself. It has a nice luxurious feeling and rinses off well without feeling slimey. After towel drying it left a nice mild scent and there was no need to put lotion on but you can for extra mousturizing.Overall would buy again, lost a star mainly since it wasn't self foaming which I prefer.",
