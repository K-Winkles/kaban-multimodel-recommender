He loves it because it works well, has a nice smell, and he feels like it really gets in there and cleans well and the nubs do feel nice on his skin. And I love it because it makes him smell INCREDIBLE and makes his skin SO FREAKING SOFT! So far he has taken several showers with it and it seems to be lasting pretty well. Only complaint is that it is kind of expensive for a daily/weekly use product but it is high quality and worth the price as long as we can afford to keep buying it haha.",

This isn\u2019t a soap that will make you feel silky smooth after a shower. It clears all the oil off your skin. The soap rinses off easier than any soap I\u2019ve seen before. It leaves you feeling like the grime, oil, and clogged skin is completely gone. You\u2019ll notice a big difference in the feel of your skin after using it once. If your skin ever feels rough because you have a bunch of little hidden blackheads, well after scrubbing with this soap bar you won\u2019t feel them anymore.",

It's great on the skin, it feels good, it smells good, it exfoliates extremely well. The problem is, I've only used it 5 or 6 times and it's 2/3 gone already. I understand because of the makeup of it, it could deteriorate quickly, but at $16 a bar! That's just too much. It is more economical if I were to buy 3, and I may do that. But it is really expensive for the life it has. I don't know, it's a tough call. I really do like it. But man... You can't just charge that kind of money and expect a great response.

Perfect amount of roughness to wake you up, clean the skin and leave you feeling refreshed. I don\u2019t use everyday as the cone shaped side wears down very quickly (3-4 washes) and the other side or what is left over isn\u2019t quite as rough/brisk. At $15-$20 per bar, I don\u2019t want to be going through 3-4 bars a month, so I use like every 3rd day etc.Amazing scent.Wish it lasted a bit longer on the cone side, or the cones were deeper etc.",
