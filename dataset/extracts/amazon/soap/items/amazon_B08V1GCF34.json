I feel my toner is better absorbed after using this soap. Every day I wake up in the morning, my face is still moist. Sometimes my wife used this soap after removing the makeup. She feels like this soap clear up the residue makeup very well. I highly recommend this soap! It's really nice!",

This popped up in amazon so it seemed good all because of the skin comparison they advertised.By the second time I used I realized I itch all over. Not bad...but I get some annoying little pricks...Annoying right!? So I helped that with a spray bottle alcohol and some eucalyptus/peppermint oil. DoneMy face did clear up. It wasnt bad but I was getting small dark spots.I also am sensitive down there when it comes to soap. No oil no fragrance can pass near that area\u263a\ufe0f.This one did good just like the Dead sea warehouse brand. Definitely adding this to my pile of options.Hope this review helps.Uh yeah shipping was find...blah",

                "reviewText": "Update: The soap has a nice scent and it doesn\u2019t dry your skin like some soaps on market. Originally, I stated that the soap did not show a drastic difference after 3 weeks and that was true. However, after 5 weeks my skin started to have a much smoother appearance. My pores are not as pronounced and I use the soap in the mesh sack to help with exfoliation. I will buy it again. Just be prepared to wait for at least 5 weeks to see a difference.",

                "reviewText": "Got for face soap, did not disappoint. Wet your face, rub the soap on skin then lather. Makes a very creamy lather, smells nice, and leaves skin clean but not dry or stripped, great for oily, combination and older skin. Love the ingredients. I keep it on a wood soap dish, and hint, you can cut it, so just use half and the save the rest for another time, keeps better, lasts longer.",
