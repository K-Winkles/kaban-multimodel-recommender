                "reviewText": "The soap itself looks fine. It's a nice shape, short of like an 8, so is less likely to slip out of your hand. It's as described, yellowish color, faint pleasant odor, and very soapy indeed. A little bit goes a long way. Whether it is effective or not, I cannot give an informed opinion yet. It certainly doesn't make the skin rash disappear within one day! What I am annoyed about is that Amazon (or the seller) has posted an image clearly showing the soap wrap written in English. The 3 soaps I received come from Indonesia, and are written in Indonesian. Therefore I have no idea about instructions or cautions. I researched the two main chemicals, and it appears that both are skin irritants. So...should I scrub briskly, or should I be gentle? How many times a day can I use it? Should I watch out for side-effects? I should have posted these questions on the buyers' forum before I bought it. So far, it doesn't seem to have done any harm, and my rash is slowly fading, so I will continue using it. But I took one star off for the misleading image. Seller should include country of origin, and take the trouble to translate what is written on the soap wrap!",

                "reviewText": "So, I recently picked up this soap because I was on the hunt for an antibacterial option specifically for my armpits. I made the mistake of trying out a \"natural deodorant\" which didn't work out so well for me, as my body just didn't agree with it and my armpits ended up being a bit smelly. It was quite a struggle when my allergies acted up and I couldn't even smell properly. But once my sense of smell returned, I knew I had to do something about the situation and get back to using regular deodorant because hygiene is really important to me. I tried washing my pits with regular soap, but it just wasn't cutting it. That's when I stumbled upon this product and decided to give it a go. And let me tell you, after just one use, I instantly noticed a difference. It really does a great job of killing the bacteria in your armpits that's causing the odor. The only thing to note is that the scent of the soap is a bit strong, so it might not be the best choice for someone who's sensitive to smells. But other than that, I think it's a fantastic option for tackling the bacteria issue.",
