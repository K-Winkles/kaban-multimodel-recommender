It's gentle enough to wash my hair, which comes out incredibly clean and shiny. So much so that it's hard to do an up do because it's so silky. The glycerin strip on the end is great for shaving, I only wish there was more of it. It's altogether a good lasting bar of soap considering it's size. If you haven't tried zum products yet, definitely do so.",
