I keep a nice selection of brand new goodies someone may have forgotten or simply just need. This one friend enjoys a bath. Doesn't like today's shower gel soaps in their array of greatness. Nope. Just Ivory. Why? It is the only soap that floats and always has. I was unaware. I couldn't find it locally. Of course, Amazon, was not going to let us down. If you want old school, very old school floating soap, look no further, Ivory has you covered. I now keep plenty on hand and have a feeling the littles might like it since it floats. This is what a silly soap review is. Ivory, it's safe, been around forever and floats.",
