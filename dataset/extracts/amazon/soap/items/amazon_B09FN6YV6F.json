So far my skin has loved this brand of soap (I typically buy Shea Moisture) and I really love the lather and the SIZE of the bar. It's nice and big and will last longer than typical bars. I'm a goth at heart so I love the black bar.I'm starting to try this on my face, as well, to see how my skin handles it. It gives me a bit too much of a squeaky clean feel but it's more affordable than my facewash I've been using so hopefully my skin adjusts.Update: my skin hs adjusted and my face is taking to this soap rather well.
