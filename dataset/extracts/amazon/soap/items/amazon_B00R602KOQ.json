What has worked for me is using this soap at night. This soap does dry your skin out a little so remember to apply lots of moisturizer and does tingle the first couple days of using but it works. When I first started I did break out a little as I thought it was a new, harsher product for my sensitive skin but the breakout eventually went away.I use this soap whenever I shower, I first wash my face with CeraVe gentle face wash, rinse, and then follow up with this soap but after I apply I let it sit on my face for the remainder of my shower and wash it off before I get out. I apply my toner which is witch hazel or Ordinary glycolic acid toner (depending on the night), Aveeno skin relief moisturizer, tretinoin cream (prescribed by my dermatologist), and La Roche double repair face moisturizer with SPF. My skin last looked this good a while ago. I highly recommend it.",

My marks are much lighter and less noticeable even though I\u2019ve used it less than 8 times in the past 3 weeks. It is very drying (along with my prescription products) so I can\u2019t use it frequently. Moisture well afterwards.Tip: if you\u2019re going to use it for areas on the body (inner thighs, underarms etc and even your face), use it while dry in the shower. Lather with water on your hands, rub on the trouble spots, wait and then turn on the water to rinse off (that way it doesn\u2019t travel to the lady bits and cause ph balance issues).",
