                "reviewText": "After using many different cleansing products, including First Botany a few times, I decided to write a review since finding quality products can be a challenge. This product used to have a pump and I am someone who like NO pump since all of them turn out to be problematical so the new NO pump works fine for me! I use the First Botany for hand cleansing only in the kitchen and bathroom. I have sensitive, dry skin and am in my 70s so have had lots of \"hand washing days\"! This product goes on easily, lathers just the right amount ... not all foamy bubbles ... just enough to wash your hands the recommended 20-30 seconds since covid came into our lives. What I especially like is that my hands feel moisturized after using ... I do NOT need to put on hand cream afterwards which has been so with other products ... meaning my hands were being dried out from washing ... not so with First Botany. I am sensitive to scents and am delighted that the combination of essential oils smells fresh, clean and peppermint might be the stronger of the scents, yet is not overpowering. My old hands feel great ... softer, moisturized and clean ... that means something good in daily living! I use another product in the shower because I have eczema on my back and legs and am not sure that the First Botany would be the best approach ... same with my face ... so I am using First Botany for hands only and am quite satisfied and have bought it more than once. Give it a try and find out for yourself. I just wanted to leave a positive review to encourage a small business and let people know.",

                "reviewText": "My Mrs. Meyers soaps were drying my hands out. I purchased this because I love the smell of peppermint. The tea tree smell had me slightly worried. It came fast. I LOVE the scent! This is really nice soap! I would purchase this again. It went up to my bathroom, where I wash my hands the most. I love to inhale the scent after pumping it onto my hands, before washing it off. If there is tea tree, the mint is stronger. Very nice. UPDATE: I ordered this 2 months ago, and put it in my bathroom, where I wash my hands a LOT. I have gone through 1 bottle and ADORE the scent. It does NOT dry out my hands. It's not really peppermint, more wintergreen. I have used scads of bottled hand soaps, and this is just excellent if you like minty smells. I'm ordering more. Highly recommend. Better than the aforementioned brand.",

As I read a couple other reviews I realized they were right. This soap really does make your hands feel better- softer, and more hydrated. It\u2019s almost like I hit the refresh button! Also smells very soothing and a small squirt goes a long way. I used to buy the big refills of antibacterial but as another review mentioned, hard to find now! I don\u2019t think I will go back. I really like this soap! It\u2019s obviously a little more expensive but sometimes you get what you pay for, and in this case it\u2019s worth the extra money.",

After using the product for a few days, I noticed a difference in my hands- they no longer felt so dry but rather moisturized most likely because the product contains Aloe Vera.

                "reviewText": "Update 12/2020: The product only came once in the white creamy form. Then it switched to a clear gel type that didn't lather as well and left my hands dry. After two more orders that way no longer purchase this item.Original review 4/2020: Ordered this soap and got it the next day w/regular shipping, very rare in our area. I like the traditional creamy soap texture, better than slimy gels that feel weird and leave a trail from the dispenser. It's smooth and lathers well with a small amount. It seems like a quality bottle and pump (includes flip-top dispenser as well). I really like the smell and it's not as overwhelming as some others. Living in Colorado's dry air and having rough blue collar hands leaves me qualified to say there is something in the soap that's leaving my hands moisturized. I'm ordering a little more for the other sinks around the house. It's a simple way to indulge myself and help relax doing a task that never seems to stop, these days especially... washing my hands.",

                "reviewText": "In this season of hand-washing until it hurts I've been looking for something that smells good, suds up nicely, and cleans well. Bonus: it doesn't make your hands fall off.So, I looked all over the place, and finally set my eyes on this one. It seemed a little pricy, but it looked better than the alternative.It smells great, a little goes a loooooong way, and it's made in the USA by a small company in my hometown, Denver, CO. Seriously. Don't buy this stuff, so I can continue to get it easily and use it in my house.",
