                "reviewText": "This soap produces a really generous amount of creamy lather even in cold water. I mean the lather is luxurious! The size of these bars of soap are a generous hand full ...nothing skimpy here. These bars of soap are firm enough that I know they are going to last for a long time. The soap is definitely moisturizing and leaves me feeling fresh and clean with no hint of greasiness. There is no soap scum left in the shower. It rinses cleanly and completely. The scent is totally neutral .. almost no smell at all. Nothing but a clean smell. The feeling of fresh and clean lasts for hours after a shower. I am thrilled with this soap. Absolutely sold! It is so gentle. I feel it is far more than 99 percent pure. I recommend this to anyone even those with sensitive skin. Washing my face in this soap before lathering up for a shave softens my beard making it much easier to shave very closely. The price is super reasonable for all the wonderful elements of experiencing this all natural soap. I will buy it again and again.",
