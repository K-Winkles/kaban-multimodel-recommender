                "reviewText": "That hasn't already been said and experienced? I have used this soap since waaaay back in the day when I was small. I remember then, it was pure like they said, and it was fun to watch it float, but boy! did it make your skin dry and itchy!!! They thankfully went back to the drawing board in the meantime, and I am happy to report that the formula they came up with is fantastic!!! They managed to keep the same integrity, the pureness, the \"float-a-bility\", but it seems they added ingredients to moisturize instead of dry out. I love the smell of Ivory, and cannot believe that was able to stay the same! For decades I forgot about this soap because I kept remembering how tight and itchy it made my skin feel, and one day I saw it in a store, and got curious and bought some. I am SO GLAD I did because that's how I found out the dryness and itchiness was gone. I don't know what they did, and I'm just going to leave well enough alone.",

Despite extensive rinsing that smell remained on my body a long time and so I\u2019m not keen. Keep it in the garage or kitchen not the bathroom.",
