                "reviewText": "Great soap to have for camping!I used it for a whole camping trip. Used it to bathe, wash hands, and do dishes.For bucket & washcloth bathing, it works pretty well! I liked it a lot. Prior to this, I would do those bath wipes in a bag. But I hated the residue/sticky feeling you get from those wipes. I just never felt clean. With this, I just use a quart of water, maybe a teaspoon of the soap and then wipe down with a washcloth. The key is to make it so the soap isn't sudsy or slippery between your fingers when you dip your fingers in the water. It is plenty strong to remove dirt and oils from your body. It left me feeling fresh and clean.For hands, you really just need the tiniest of drops. It is a very strong soap so a little bit goes a long way.Dishes cleaned just fine with this. For being in the back country and trying our best to keep the environment safe and clean, I feel okay about using this. I've tried CampSuds before and it just does not have the cleaning power for dishes. You would end up with greasy plates and pans even after washing and scrubbing. Dr. Bronners is a good alternative. Has some decent cleaning power while being less polluting than actual dishsoap. I am sold.",

                "reviewText": "\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50I recently tried Dr. Bronner's Pure-Castile Liquid Soap in the Baby Unscented variant, and while I found the product to be of high quality with its organic ingredients and versatile uses, I'm providing a four-star review due to the relatively high price point. Here's a breakdown of my experience:1. **High-Quality Ingredients:** Dr. Bronner's commitment to using organic oils is evident in the product's quality. The soap is gentle, suitable for sensitive skin, and versatile in its 18-in-1 uses.2. **Multi-Purpose Use:** The versatility of this soap is a standout feature. I appreciate that I can use it for various purposes such as face wash, hair care, laundry, and even dishwashing. It's a convenient all-in-one solution for daily cleaning needs.3. **Gentle for Sensitive Skin:** The Baby Unscented variant, with no added fragrance, is gentle and suitable for sensitive skin. It doesn't cause irritation, making it a great option for individuals with skin sensitivities, including babies.4. **Vegan and Non-GMO:** The commitment to being vegan and non-GMO aligns with my preferences for ethical and sustainable products. It's reassuring to know that the soap is produced with these considerations in mind.5. **Effective Cleaning:** The soap effectively cleans and lathers well, providing a satisfying cleaning experience. Whether used for personal care or household tasks, it delivers on its promise of cleanliness.6. **Slight Concerns About Price:** The main concern is the relatively high price. While I understand the value of organic and ethically sourced ingredients, the cost may be a factor for some consumers, especially when comparing it to other multi-purpose soaps in the market.7. **Packaging and Size:** The 8-ounce size is convenient for various uses, but for some users, especially those who use the product regularly, a larger size might be preferred to enhance value for money.8. **Eco-Friendly Initiatives:** It's worth noting that Dr. Bronner's has a strong commitment to environmental sustainability and fair trade practices, contributing to the overall positive perception of the brand.In conclusion, Dr. Bronner's Pure-Castile Liquid Soap is a high-quality and versatile product that aligns with ethical and environmental values. I rate it four stars, with the main consideration being the price, which may impact its accessibility for a broader audience. If price is not a deterrent, this soap offers a reliable and eco-friendly option for various cleaning needs.",

This is absolutely amazing. It is soft, cleanses your skin, and leaves no scent. FYI: I use this as liquid body soap in the shower, but it has many uses and it definitely met my standards.
