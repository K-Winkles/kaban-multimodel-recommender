                "reviewText": "I just got this in Monday, I ordered it on Sat, wasn't expecting it until Wed. So that is awesome, keep up the good work amazon.I cannot speak on it to much as I just started using it, though so far it's nice. I can say, from using other soaps, to this one...its different. It's going great, feels moisturizing, leaves me all tingly. Once it's rinsed off, it's just that, gone. My skin doesn't feel any drier, but I can say it's feels hydrated either?! I smell good, feel good so it's doing what it's supposed to, lol. I'll see how it is after the first week, maybe month just be sure. I bought this in hopes of clearing up some random acne that popped up on my back and on my body, as well as be good to my skin. Nothing has disappeared overnight, but I can say it's definitely clearing up. I am also VERY glad it's not overly minty scented, nothing against peppermint, just don't want to be overwhelmed by it. I do like the scent of this soap, mild, earthy and lifts my mood everytime I take a shower.Late update:I used this for a month and was pleased. It didn't clear my skin up sadly, it did help tame it so I am blaming hormones or blisters from sunburn. Either way, this calmed my skin down considerably, definitely helped with BO, working out, eating crazy..I'll just leave it there, lol.The one downside I will say is the soap residue that left over. From this and my shampoo and conditioner bars, was CRAZY! So do try it out, you won't be too disappointed, but also beware of soap scum build up.",

I\u2019ve used it for at least ten years and use nothing else. It would break my heart if I could not find it any longer, so I buy extra. You don\u2019t have to use much, it works that good and smells subtle but oh so good. Highly, highly recommended this bar of soap from Paul Mitchell tea tree line. I use the shampoo in this line too. It won\u2019t dry out your skin either. Best wishes.",

                "reviewText": "Seifen zur K\u00f6rperpflege verwende ich schon lange. Ich mag das angenehm saubere und reine Gef\u00fchl, welches sie auf der haut hinterlassen. R\u00fcckfettendes Duschgel hinterl\u00e4sst dagegen bei mir immer ein Gef\u00fchl, was ich nicht mag.Bei der Seife von Paul Mitchell handelt es sich um ein 150 Gramm schweres St\u00fcck. Das sind 50 % als bei vielen anderen Seifen. Dies relativiert ein wenig den doch sehr hohen Preis.Das erste, was mich an dieser Seife begeistert, ist das wunderbare Schaumverm\u00f6gen. Der Schaum ist sehr weich und fein. Der zweite wichtige Punkt: Der Glyceringehalt (entsteht nat\u00fcrlicherweise bei der Verseifung von Fetten und \u00d6len) scheint sehr hoch zu sein. Jedenfalls war nach meinem Empfinden bisher noch keine von mir genutzte Seife derart hautpflegend und angenehm. Wirklich phantastisch!Der Duft ist ebenfalls beeindruckend. Man riecht und sp\u00fcrt die leicht k\u00fchlende Minze. Aber auch Rosmarin und Teebaum sind zu riechen. Insgesamt ergibt sich ein nicht zu schwerer m\u00e4nnlicher Geruch.Die Inhaltsstoffe sind f\u00fcr ein Produkt einer gro\u00dfen Kette ebenfalls toll. Neben Palm- und Kokos\u00f6l finden sich acht verschiedene Kr\u00e4uter- und Pflanzenextrakte in dieser Seife.Ja, geringe Mengen EDTA sind ebenfalls enthalten und verbessern das Schaumverm\u00f6gen und verringern die Kalkseifenbildung. Wer EDTA nicht nutzen m\u00f6chte, f\u00fcr den ist diese Seife leider nichts. Aber dies kann jeder selbst entscheiden. EDTA ist ein zugelassener kosmetischer Inhaltsstoff.Fazit: Super toller Duft, hervorragend hautpflegend. Mit einer Ausnahme nur nat\u00fcrliche Inhaltsstoffe, wie man sie in einer Seife erwartet. F\u00fcr mich sind das f\u00fcnf Sterne. Einzig der Preis ist arg hoch, daf\u00fcr gibt es aber auch eine Seife mit 150 Gramm.",
