Almost feels like you're putting on lotion, lol. The few different scents I've tried all have smelled quite nice. This one smells lovely. My husband and I both like this scent too.I first found the website for SoapBox on Grove .com buying a coconut hair conditioner of theirs, and feel in love with it. I've since also begun using both their coconut bar shampoo and bar conditioner, and really love that too. It was then I found their hand soaps.The company makes amazing more natural, clean products. But they also are dedicated to donating soaps for people in need all around the world, one for each item sold. I think that's awesome, and I like helping to support that as well.",

This scent is fairly feminine though so might not be the best for \"manly\" men; but I love it and this is going to be my go-to soap in my bathrooms and kitchen from here on out. I did find that one of the bottles was impossible to open which other reviewers have said was an issue; I will have to use another bottle pump in the one I can't get open.

                "reviewText": "I love the scent, but for me, it actually has too much fragrance, and irritated my sensitive skin. I washed my hands with it, and was excited because it doesn't smell like most other soaps. It has a creamy, musky scent. The vanilla is in the background, and the musk is on top. The consistency and look is similar to some Softsoap handsoaps. Thick, slimy, pearlescent. It's not a transparent gel looking soap. I rinsed my hands and realized that the scent was still heavily left behind. My palms began to hurt, and itch immediately. It stripped what little moisture I had on my hands. Keep in mind, I have very dry, sensitive skin, so this likely won't be the case for everyone. I'm deducting a star not because of how it made my skin feel, but because I think the scent left behind was far too much. I washed my hands three times with my regular hand soap, and could still smell this soap on my hands. I actually love fragrance, and wouldn't mind smelling like this, but yeah, just too much for my skin to tolerate, sadly. I wish this scent were available in some sort of other product. Perfume/body spray, room spray, etc. because I really do love how it smells.",
