Like I said in the headline, Costco which sold it for slightly less quit...why no one seems to know.. maybe some new manager thought he'd push some other smelly soap. Value is comparable so don't let that be the determining factor....there are 20 bars in this. I don't have sensitive skin so it is fine. If you do you might buy a singe bar and try. I just know I appreciate the smell when I sweating up a storm at work. The original bars years ago had more residual scent but I like in the shower. There will be soap scum in the tub over time so you are not getting a break there.",
