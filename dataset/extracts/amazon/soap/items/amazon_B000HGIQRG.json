                "reviewText": "I've been using Basis Sensitive Skin Bar Soap for a few weeks now, and I can confidently say that it has completely transformed my skincare routine. A well-formulated product that is gentle enough for even the most sensitive skin, it delicately cleanses without stripping away essential moisture.What sets this soap apart is its balanced formulation. Enriched with calming chamomile and hydrating aloe vera, this soap not only cleanses but also soothes the skin. The natural ingredients lend it a therapeutic feel, making each bath akin to a mini spa session right in the comfort of my home. As someone with skin that tends to react to harsher formulations, this bar soap was a breath of fresh air.Moreover, Basis Sensitive Skin Bar Soap isn't just limited to body wash - it doubles as an excellent facial cleanser too. The bar is gentle enough to use on the face, removing dirt and oil without causing any irritation or dryness. After each use, my skin feels clean, refreshed, and not tight or overly dry, as is the case with many other bar soaps.The fragrance-free formulation is another major plus, especially for those of us with sensitive skin prone to irritation from added perfumes or fragrances. Even without an artificial scent, this soap maintains a clean and refreshing feel, thanks to its natural ingredients.In terms of practicality, the bar lasts for a considerable amount of time, making it a cost-effective option for daily skincare. The size and shape of the soap are also comfortable to hold, with the bar lathering up well to deliver a luxurious washing experience.In summary, Basis Sensitive Skin Bar Soap is a fantastic choice for anyone seeking a gentle yet effective skincare solution. It is a product that truly lives up to its promise, providing a cleanse that not only leaves skin clean but also soothed and nourished. Whether you're using it as a body wash or a facial cleanser, you can't go wrong with this soap. I wholeheartedly recommend this product to all, especially those with sensitive skin like me.As I continue to use this soap, I look forward to experiencing more of the positive effects it has on my skin. Kudos to Basis for developing such a high-quality product.",

                "reviewText": "Let's face it, rating a bar of soap is probably the most subjective review anyone can write because people's tastes vary so much. So I'll keep this short. It has a slight scent. Feels dense. Lathers very well. Advertised as good for sensitive skin (I've had no issues with it). I bought this brand for its quality value per dollar. I believe it is a high quality, dense bar that is reasonably priced which means its a good value. I have reordered the six pack so many times over the years, I've lost count. You just have to try it and see if you like it.",

I wanted NO FRAGRANCE and that's what I got!The soap is easy to handle in the shower because of its unique shape and 4 oz size. Packaging is much more than I expected; I truly LOVE these! I can see me using these for the next century of my life - I highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I once thought this soap was only for faces. Then, I got lazy and started using it as my regular bar soap. Turns out, being lazy paid dividends 10x over ... because this soap is excellent as a one-bar for all solution.The thing is; Most of us have sensitive skin, whether we know it or not. I get minor irritations from fragrances in soaps, harsh detergents, and a variety of allergy-induced issues. This soap removes most of those issues from the scene since it's gentle, fragrance-free, and doesn't over-degrease your skin.And yeah, I'm a dude ... but I'm a dude who cares about the largest and most important organ in my body (i.e., skin). Over-cleaning skin causes problems. Under-cleaning skin causes problems. Over-fragranced soaps cause problems. But this one doesn't. It's also rightly priced, which is weird in today's marketplace.Soaps are surprisingly personal, but I've found that this one leaves my skin cleanest, healthiest, and doesn't over-dry my skin, as some heavier detergent-laced soaps can. I live by these bars, and since they're not reliably available in my area, I'm glad that I can get a large pack like this from Amazon. Definitely recommend this to anyone who finds other soaps to be over-drying, or who is prone to allergies or rashes. Perfect for face and body.",
