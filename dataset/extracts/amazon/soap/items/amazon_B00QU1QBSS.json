I love how much you get in one bar, it\u2019s incredibly moisturizing, smells AMAZING, didn\u2019t irritate my sensitive skin, and its ingredients are Yuka approved. Someone asked what the lovely scent was and if they could borrow some (I ended up giving them a bar because of how much they loved it)",
