It's really meant to be replaced often in high-traffic public bathrooms but I bought it for home use and it works just as well if you have the right dispenser.One thing I think is left to be desired is the smell - I didn't particularly like the scent before but have gotten used to it now. But I've used the pink foam cleanser (non-antibacterial) and that smelled wonderfully. I stuck with this soap because it's antibacterial.",
