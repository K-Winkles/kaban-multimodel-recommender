Cleans well and skin feels soft and hydrated after. I have sensitive skin and this stuff is great! Really like the scents too, they\u2019re nice but not overpowering at all.I love the coconut one and the alpine spices. I recently got the mango one that has exfoliating stuff in it, and won\u2019t be getting it again. It tore my skin up like I washed with broken glass. Smelled great, but took a week for my skin to recover. The other ones are fabulous for me though. I\u2019ll use the exfoliating mango one on my legs before I shave, but not on any sensitive skin again.",

                "reviewText": "TL/DR: 3.5 stars. Great lather, fragrance disappears quickly. Much smaller than expected.I really wanted to love this soap. I love the company and what they stand for, and frankly it is good soap. It does a great job lathering up and cleaning, and doesn't contain any nasty stuff. It's good soap. I just wish the cedar and pine smell would have hung around a little longer. It starts off smelling great, But just ends up smelling soapy after a week or so of use. The smell definitely changes over time and loses a lot of its initial potency. In fact at the outset it's a little too strong, kind of overwhelming, makes your whole bathroom smell like this stuff. But when it mellows and the fragrance becomes less aggressive, it's different. It doesn't smell like a forest anymore. It's almost like synthetic pine air freshener. Also, these are really small. I was kind of surprised how small they are. Definitely not a shower soap--far too small. More of a hand soap for a soap dish by the sink. I'm going to try a different scent next time, perhaps that one will stick around. Also the sharp corners of a new bar make it difficult to hold on to, and if you try to use this in the shower it's going to fly everywhere.",

                "reviewText": "My skin is extremely sensitive and I'm allergic to many of the commonly used ingredients in soaps/body washes plus I'm vegan. With that said, it's hard for me to find a product that I like and that works well for me. I switched from another natural brand that worked ok but I was bored with to this one. I was really enticed by the scent combinations as the other brand was unscented. I loved it so much I just recently ordered it again in another scent! This soap lathers very nicely, is moisturizing and smells wonderful. I was expecting a creamsicle like scent, which isn't quite it, but it genuinely does smell of vanilla and citrus. Like a more clean/sophisticated scent without being too strong or overwhelming. I keep my soap bars just outside of the shower and they seemed to last pretty long. I average about a bar every two months. It seems to help prevent the itchy dry skin I normally struggle with every winter. I really have no complaints about these at all and will continue to use them :)",

                "reviewText": "I was on the search to upgrade my bar soap as the one I would get at the local pharmacy just wasn't cutting it anymore. I bought this soap set while it was on sale and do not regret it. so much so that it prompted me to go to the company's website and buy their gift box set!Now, Im the type that showers twice a day so morning and night. I also use a washcloth and lather it once. 1 bar of soap within this set will last half a month with the frequency of daily showering will last me three weeks so that means the 3 bar set last 2 months and 3 weeks. Yup, I like to see what Im getting for my money so I had to do all of that math.With that said, it is so moisturizing and deep cleansing. I truly feel cleansed by the end of my shower especially in the pit area as I suffer from Hyperhidrosis under my arms so I use heavy deodorants as a result and this thing still manages to remove the build up and is so strong that it replaces it with the scent of the bar. Love it!Now for the scent, it is so FRAGRANT and to me that is a great thing! When I first opened the bar and placed in my shower it took up to 5 minutes for the whole bathroom to smell like it and 3 more minutes for the smell to reach my living room....MY GOODNESS! Even my maintenance people who came on my apartment made a comment on it and I giggled to myself, haha! So needless to say if you're one who likes to wear perfume, you may be able to skip it some days as this soap will be all the perfume you need if you want. The smell from the bar doesn't smell artificial either which I am pleased about.With the nature of how this soap is comprised, you will have to wash your shower more frequently to remove the build up. For me I have to wash my shower like 2 to 3 times a week but that's because I also use a body lotion that is natural as well so its just builds times 2 when it comes to shower time, sigh. But hey, the quality of the ingredients makes it all worth it for me. As nothing feels better than being able to step out of the shower feeling a deep sense of cleanliness..Affordable self-care.I will be sticking to this brand for some time and hope that they do not change the ingredient list. Its good as it is! Just maybe increase the bar size or lessen the degradation time of the bars so it can last longer?",
