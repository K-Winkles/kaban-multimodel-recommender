J'ai command\u00e9 3 fois le m\u00eame produits Deep Action Scrub avec les billes, tel qu'affich\u00e9 sur le site (2 paquets de 3 barres et 1 paquet de 6 barres) mais je n'ai re\u00e7u qu'un seul paquet de 3 barres avec les billes. Celui de 6 barres est le Active Scub sans billes et l'autre de 3 barres est le Active Scrub sans billes aussi, ils sont donc diff\u00e9rent et beaucoup moins cher que ce que j'ai pay\u00e9? C'est de la fausse publicit\u00e9.Murielle, Canada",
