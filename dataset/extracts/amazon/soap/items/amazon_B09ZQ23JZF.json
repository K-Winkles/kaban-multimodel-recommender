The soap lathers up nicely and has a pleasant, refreshing scent that isn't overpowering. What sets this soap apart is how it leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized, without any dryness or residue.The ingredients in this soap are all natural, which is a big plus for me. I appreciate that the product is free from harsh chemicals and artificial fragrances. It's gentle enough for daily use and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin.Another thing I love about this soap is its durability. It doesn't dissolve quickly like some other bar soaps I've used, so I know it will last me a while.Overall, I highly recommend Dr. Jekyll Bar Soap. It's a quality product that delivers on its promises. If you're looking for a natural, effective, and long-lasting soap, this one is definitely worth trying out.",

It quite powerful on the nose, my whole bathroom smells like the soap so there\u2019s that. Not bad for price, if you\u2019re looking for something that has some sort of grit this soap is not what you want however it is slightly more cost effective than dr Squatch soaps. So if money is the factor that determines which one you go with than this soap could be a viable alternative. As for me I\u2019m going to keep looking for another soap",
