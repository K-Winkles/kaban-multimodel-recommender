I was extremely frustrating to me when every retail store I went to in Edmonton Alberta for at least the past 2 years looking for this product decided not to put this soap in its shelves. Why they decided to do this is a complete mystery. It could not be because there were no customers looking for this soap bar. I found others looking for it at the same time. It is an excellent bar soap, and I hope it remains available to customers like me for many years to come on Amazon.",
