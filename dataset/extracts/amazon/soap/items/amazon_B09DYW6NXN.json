                "reviewText": "My go to shampoo bar doubled in price, so I decided to try something new. I was a bit skeptical that this was a 2-in-1 body wash and shampoo, as I have fine textured southeast Asian hair and a lot of it. It lathered super easily and I was like oh no, this is going to be so drying. Imagine my surprise when my hair looked normal. It wasn't dry at all. It felt like my hair should!Other shampoo bars don't lather well, and when you get your hair lathered, the amount of bubbles drastically melts over time until it just gets watery and starts dripping. I don't have that problem with this one. It lathers and stays bubbly for a good amount of time.And it smells so good! I love the smell of this and it actually stays in my hair!! I have to braid my hair to manage it, and when I let it out, it smells so heavenly. Even with it out and not concentrated with the braids, it smells so good. Multiple people have told me I smell good when I hug them. Even if I skip a couple days of washing, it smells good! I'm going to try out more scents!I love that this is military member affiliated/owned and that a portion is donated to support vets and their families. I have a lot of military members in my family and it's nice that I can support others out there.",

                "reviewText": "Update January 2024:Even though I love this soap, I\u2019m knocking off one star because Bravo Sierra has stopped offering the unscented version, and the price has increased from $9.99 to $12 (actually $14 on their website) within the last 3 months. I loved this soap for its value and quality. Don\u2019t lose loyal customers. Find another way to deal with inflation. A bar of soap shouldn\u2019t be $12\u2026 Also, since my initial review, I\u2019ve tried some of the scented versions, and love them just as much. I used it on my hair too, and it works just as well as natural shampoos I\u2019ve tried. The Fig & Sandalwood scent smells exactly like a classic barbershop (or Pinaud-Clubman After Shave, IYKYK). But again, with all of that, I\u2019d love to see the unscented version come back and for the price to be more reasonable.Original Review:When I first opened the box, I was a little concerned by the hairline fractures you can see in this photo because of another review that mentions the soap falling apart. So I purposely tried to break it\u2026 and it\u2019s fine. These fractures are clearly a result of the way the soap is made but don\u2019t affect its durability at all. I\u2019ve been using the soap for about a week now, and it\u2019s holding up. As far as smell, I wouldn\u2019t call it scent-free (but there is no fragrance added). The ingredients it\u2019s made with have their own subtle, pleasant scent that is kind of powdery. This soap lathers really nicely, and I don\u2019t need to rub it all over my body to get it to spread. I just wet the bar and rub it between my hands, and it makes a ton of lather that I can use all over. I would describe the lather and the feeling of the soap as milky. It feel luxurious. The soap also doesn\u2019t leave that classic soapy film or tacky feeling on my skin. After my shower, I feel refreshed, clean, and natural. The subtle scent lingers just long enough without being intrusive. I haven\u2019t tried it on my hair (and probably won\u2019t), but I\u2019m satisfied with the soap so far!",

Excellent scent, lather, longevity, etc. Since then the price has gone up to $14 listed on their website but they haven't changed a thing about it and their products have become scarcer on amazon. They don't even sell their hair paste anywhere any more despite how great it was and all the glowing reviews it got. Not sure what is going on but it's a real shame. May end up swapping to a different brand before long.",

                "reviewText": "Like many people I\u2019ve been searching for that one perfect sudsy, lathery, great smelling, bar of soap. I\u2019m happy to say my search has ended with the Bravo Sierra Cleansing Bar.First let me start by saying this isn\u2019t even a bar of \u201csoap\u201d\u2026it has all natural ingredients that won\u2019t get irritating chemicals onto or into your body\u2026or waste water (the fishes of the world thank you). It\u2019s all natural ingredients have won it the \u201ccradle to cradle\u201d certification meaning it\u2019s ingredients are either naturally occurring in the environment or they mimic naturally occurring elements in the environment.Second\u2026Let me assure you this cleansing bar works on your whole body. It is designed to be a complete shampoo and body bar\u2026and it leaves my hair, beard and body squeaky clean and with its scent of cedar wood and lavender leaves you smelling super clean and refreshed.Lastly\u2026This Cleansing bar comes in a 7.0 Ounce bar! It\u2019s much larger than an ordinary bar of soap. I shower daily and each bar lasts me 30-40 washes!..so you\u2019re getting a lot more use from just one bar vs ordinary bar soap.I only use Bravo Sierra Cleansing Bars for my showering. They also have a great line of deodorants that are superb. But that\u2019s for another review.Hope this was helpful.",

Combined with a soap bag I'll never use body wash again. Rinses clean and doesn't leave a ridiculously strong scent. The brick is a generous size and will last you for a good long while. I'm really impressed by their products.",
