This is not an in-depth book but is a good reference book, has a nice overview of equipment and procedures plus it does have a couple of recipes in it. The bad things are that when she talks about lye she explains that there are two types. Sodium hydroxide for solid soaps and Potassium hydroxide for liquid soap. BUT then says \"For the purpose of this book, make sure you get a lye made of potassium hydroxide, since you will be learning how to make solid soaps\". WHAT??! She just said potassium hydroxide is for liquid soap but she wants to use it for solid soaps now? Which is it? On a couple of the recipes in the list of ingredients, for example, it says \"9.815 ounces lye (5 percent super fatted), 16 ounces coconut oil, 18 ounces olive oil, 16 ounces palm oil, 4 ounces Shea butter, 16 ounces tallow, 70 ounces totals, 23 ounces water.\" What does \"super fatted\" mean? What is \"totals\"? Neither of these were covered in the book. For a newbie this isn't the book you want. For someone that just wants to brush up on things this might work for your if you write in the margins correcting and defining the issues.",
