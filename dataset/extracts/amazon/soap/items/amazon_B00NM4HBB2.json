                "reviewText": "I can't say enough good stuff about this bar soap from Baxter of California. I have very dry skin and have always had a hard time finding a soap that left my skin feeling moisturized and left me NOT looking like Ashy Larry. I was a very loyal Dr. Squatch user, but was frustrated by how quickly the bars were gone. After seeing how many positive reviews there were for this soap, I decided to give it a try. It's been almost a year since I switched and I am never using another soap.The bars last almost exactly 30 days, so while the price tag seems high, it actually ends up being cheaper than using a $7 bar of Dr. Squatch every week. I am 6' 4\" and have a bigger frame, so I would imagine it will last even longer on someone who is of more average size!The smell is masculine and smells like cedar and kind of musky. I get compliments regularly for the scent and my wife enjoys the smell as well. The lather is creamy, and the exfoliating particles are not too abrasive, they are just right. I use this on my entire body and have never experienced any adverse effects.I highly recommend this soap for dudes with dry skin who like to smell good!",

                "reviewText": "THIS... is Baxter's Cedarwood and Oak Moss Essence bar of soap (2 pack) and I have fallen in love with it. I don't usually use bar soap, but was recently convinced to try it out and I am glad I did!This bar of soap smells amazing, and while I would say it is generally a male-leaning scent... my fiance uses it before her bodywash because it smells so good, and the cleaning beads work really well. It suds up quite well, but not too much. I find that this bar of soap does congeal up slightly between uses like other high-end bars of soap from water being left on it, so I recommend putting it in a container between washes to keep it from washing away.I thought that this was expensive for a bar of soap, however, it is well worth the extra money and I can tell a difference from my old dove and irish spring bars of soap that I kept around. I really feel that the beads and soap clean and scrub well! Will be returning to buy more for me and my fiance now and am hooked on Baxter soap!",

Very rich and thick lather. Lathers up very quickly and washes off easily. I do a double lather and double rinse and the soap smell lasts on me for hours. Very noticeable. You get what you pay for. This one bar is worth more than 12 bars of dove or any other generic soap. Your body and nose will love you. I will be reviewing this on my youtube as well. Enjoy gentlemen!",
