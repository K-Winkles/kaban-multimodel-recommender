                "reviewText": "Love the scent of this soap. I got it previously in an autumn-themed multipack and then ordered a full 3-pack of the Acorn Spice, as it was my favorite. Sweet, spicy, and vanilla-y. It also feels nice on your hands. Only issue was that one of the bottles leaked quite a bit in the packaging. Seemed like the top had become unscrewed a bit\u2026 wish it had been secured better. But otherwise the product was great, only the packaging was lacking.",
