        "description": "For skin that looks soft, smooth and radiant, turn to the Dove Beauty Bar. With 1/4 moisturizing cream, it goes beyond cleansing, nourishing skin as it washes away the day, The secret to beautiful skin is moisture, and no ordinary bar hydrates like Dove. That\u2019s because Dove isn\u2019t soap, it\u2019s a Beauty Bar. While ordinary soaps can strip skin of essential moisture, Dove Beauty Bar has mild cleansers to effectively wash away dirt and germs and care beautifully. Made with our 1/4 moisturizing cream, Dove Beauty Bar leaves your body, face and hands feeling soft, smooth, and radiant. You can see why we call it a Beauty Bar. If you\u2019re a fan of the Dove Original Beauty Bar, why not try them all? We have a Dove Beauty Bar to suit any need. Our Winter Care Beauty Bar is perfect for nourishing dry winter skin. For some pampering, choose our Restoring Beauty Bar with a rich, invigorating scent or reveal more radiant-looking skin with our Gentle Exfoliating Beauty Bar.",
