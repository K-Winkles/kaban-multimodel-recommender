I get bad face dandruff, aka Seborrhea and other soaps don't help at all to treat it. I need a good anti fungal that does the job and is also kind to my skin and this stuff is amazing. My dermatologist just said today that my skin is perfect, smooth and looks like a twenty year old when I'm a few years/decades older than that, so I love this soap!Pros. A little bit goes a long way.It works very well.It smells like tea tree and though some don't enjoy that smell, I really like it.Cons, it's a bit pricey but considering the pros it's okay. I have tried to find other products for less that work for what I want and they don't work. This makes it well worth the price. I will definitely continue to buy.",
