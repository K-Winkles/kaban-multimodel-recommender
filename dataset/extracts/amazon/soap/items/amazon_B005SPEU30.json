                "reviewText": "Some reviews are difficult to write,especially when I'm unhappy with a product.However that's not the case here.Using Dove white bar cleanser for many years with better than amazing results,as it has kept my skin as young looking as possible for being in my early 50s. Concurrently I'd never consider switching even if I was being paid to do so.However when Dove introduced this new bar,infused with the essence of pomegranate,hibiscus tea,and lemon verbena I decided to give it a shot.Happily I wasn't disappointed and know others won't be.Functioning just as well or even a bit better in my opinion,than the original white.This bar will leave your skin refreshed and rejuvenated.Also I can guarantee that if you commit to using it twice daily,you will experience equally amazing results.The intoxicating combined scents of the pomegranate,hibiscus and lemon verbena will keep you wanting more,taking you on a trip to a tropical paridise.As for my brothers out there,if your gonna be hung up about using a pink cleanser on your face,your missing out.Men have skin too and if you wanna stay in the game,you gotta look your best.A good facial care routine is vital for everyone,women and men alike,and it's never too early to start.There's so many reasons to love this product including its affordable price.However what I like and appreciate most is that this product is PETA certified,so no animals were harmed when making it,which is huge plus.As stated earlier some reviews are difficult to write,however this was extremely easy.My words in this review,easily flowed with speed and sincerity,indicating just how much I like and recommend this product.",
