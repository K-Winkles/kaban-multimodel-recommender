When the pandemic hit, we were washing our hands more, doing more cooking, cleaning in general, and shopping at the grocery stores less often (more carts, fewer trips). Seemed like we were always running low on soaps (I don't like to use dish soap on my hands because it is usually too drying). Honestly, I expected this soap to be about the same scenario because the price point was low for the amount you get in bulk. I was pleasantly surprised that it was creamy and not drying with a pleasant scent.",

The bright pink in most dispensers are similar but with a citrus fragrance. Lots of hand soaps cause my hands to itch but my hands have felt just fine, I also the rose smell is almost like smelling a rose so its nice, not super manly but it does not stick around after you rinse it off. I use a 30oz pump dispenser mounted in my bathroom, you can pick them up for about $10-15 and will dispense any liquid soaps. The price must fluctuate on this product, I paid $8.53, the day it arrived it cost $13.30, a week later when I write this is now $12.32.",

                "reviewText": "I have been ordering this \"all purpose skin cleanser soap\" for 1 yr+ for my business, and recently they have started sending a different soap product: \"pink lotion soap.\" Which is basically water, with a very small amount of soap in it. I thought it was a fluke the first time, but I've ordered it twice now and both times received this incorrect cheap soap. Pink Lotion Soap is actually another Geniune Joe product with product number 02107. But now it looks like they have relabeled the \"All Purpose Skin Cleanser\" 02105, as Pink Lotion Soap. Just take a look at the photos here to see. So Buyer Beware, you'll be receiving watery bright pink soap, instead of the listed product. 1/10 would not recommend this anymore.***update: the photo with two soap bottles shows the original product on left, and then on the right it shows the new product they are sending, with the same item number there on both bottles, but NOT the same product. ***",
