                "reviewText": "I was introduced to this brand of soap by my husband who gave me one of the bars of charcoal soap of the same brand. I very much liked this soap, but decided to explore some of the different soaps made by this company. I decided on this lemon sage soap because I thought the lemon scent would smell fresh.I absolutely love this soap. My previous brand was supposed to be a moisturizing soap, but every winter, I had to put moisturizing cream on my legs after a bath or they would itch like crazy by the next day from dryness. After taking a bath with this soap, my legs feel soft and moisturized, and there is no itching. Other things that I like about this soap is that it's a large bar and lasts me quite a while; the lemon scent is not strong, but has a delicate fresh smell; it provides so much lather with very little effort. In the time I have been using this soap, my skins is softer and not dry at all. I have also noticed that it rinses off easily and leaves no soap residue on my skin.This is a soap that I will continue buying. It may cost a little more than some soaps, but the large bar lasts so much longer, you get more for your money. So, it ends up being more economical than the less expensive soaps, and it is much better for your skin.UPDATE 11/21/20:I initially bought 2 3-packs of this soap in lemon and shea butter formulas about 1 1/2 years ago. I have been using it for both my mother and I, and still have two bars left. So, it really does last a long time. I just re-ordered 2 3-packs of the lemon/sage and lavender formulas. I love the rich, thick lather that these soaps produce with very little rubbing of the bars. I am 74 and my Mom is over 100, and this soap has truly helped to keep our skin moisturized. The dried scabbing skin I had on my elbows is non-existent now. In some lighting, the skin on my forearms used to look somewhat dried and scaly , but it hasn't looked like that since using this soap. Even at over 100, my Mom's skin looks healthy and people have commented on how good her skin looks. I do tend to favor the lemon and lavender scents just because they smell so good. This is the only bath soap I will use from now on, and highly recommend it.I hope this review is helpful for you. I will update this review if my opinion changes or if I have additional information.",

                "reviewText": "This activated charcoal soap is a great soap! I absolutely love and recommend it for its natural cleanliness, skin softening effects, and deodorizing effects! I read about a natural deodorant and soap in an article that I stumbled onto while reading about old time home products and remedies that are still superior to today's products but unheard of by today's consumers. I read about charcoal soaps, and remembered hearing my mother tell about my grandmother making lurch soaps when she was a child. I saw an ad for an activated charcoal soap, and I decided to purchase one and try it. First, it made the soap dish gray, but that soap was AWESOME! My skin became softer, I found that this soap evidently had a deodorizing effect, as I was still without odor after being unable to bathe for 48 hours, my skin was always so soft after washing using this activated charcoal soap, and I always feel so clean after bathing with it. However, if you use only white washcloths. you will have to bleach them to remove all of the gray color residue. I use a few older blue washcloths and bleach them. This soap is definitely worth the extra work doing the laundry! After the first charcoal bar that I used. I was hooked on charcoal soap. I have looked for it in local stores, but I haven't been able to locate any, so I will continue to order this from Amazon! GREAT SOAP!!!",

                "reviewText": "I've used several formulas of the One With Nature brand bar soaps and have found them all to work well for my skin. But my favorite is this argan oil & shea butter bar. My skin tends toward dryness and I've tried several types of soap to combat this, while also wanting my skin to feel clean without greasiness. This soap does the job very well for me. I've even gotten my husband and son to start using them and they are very satisfied with the results as well...both have dry skin, like me. The fragrance is pleasant, with no noticeable added scent. I highly recommend this brand and this seller. Packaged well and timely delivery.",
