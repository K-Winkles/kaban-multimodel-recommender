                "reviewText": "Seriously, one of the most wondrous smells you will ever come across.First off, let me just get the functionality of the soap out of the way. It will get you squeaky clean. Literally. Made with the finest ingredients and moisturizers. And the best part is that soap bars always go a long way.Now to the true effects of the soap (after you come out of the shower). I've tried several body washes and soaps which smell great but as soon as I wipe myself with the towel, I don't sense the scent linger on my skin/body. When you have a high quality product like this Turbo Bar, trust me when I say hours later this amazing scent will linger on your skin and really ravel people's senses around you.Now to my favorite and the best part: the scent, fragrance, smell, whatever you want to call it. I'm a very outdoorsy person. I'm talking adventurous.. campfires, mountain hiking, cabins, wild explorations in the forest, etc. This scent gives me the same rush. It smells like nature. But not the annoying nature smell. The GREAT one. Smells like fresh pine forests at the top of a mountain with a hint of firewood and neroli after you've just come out of a dip in a pool filled with the best essential oils. The perfect word is FRESH.Seriously, the freshest smell there is. Girls will go crazy over this smell. I get compliments all the time from people thinking it's the cologne I'm wearing but really in my mind I know the secret. And it's this: Jack Black Turbo Body Bar.Become one with nature with this stuff. Smell like a millionaire.***UPDATE***This is an update just to inform potential buyers how long this soap bar lasts. I first bought this bar in late September/early October of 2013. I just bought my second bar a few weeks ago. The fact that one bar lasts half a year is beyond my imagination. So people claim that it's \"expensive\". Well, first, realize that you're investing in a quality soap (investing in the well being of your body, rather). And besides that, you're spending a measly 30 bucks on soap for 365 days. Even if you buy 3 bars, ok so $45 bucks, no biggie compared to those liquid body washes that you have to buy every 2 or 3 months that don't even last. There's a reason guys in the 60's were getting laid left and right (like in Mad Men)... they used soap bars. Trust me when I recommend this product. It lasts forever. My only recommendation is to buy a body sponge/loofah (google it). It's the most effective way to use a soap bar. Wet the bar, rub it a few times against the sponge to form a lather, and you're good to go. If you're using the bar and physically rubbing it all over your body, you're doing it wrong. And on a side note, it lasted me almost 6 months, and I take showers about 5 out of 7 days, so clearly the situation proves that if done right, this bar can last you a long time and it's a high quality product.Also, just to add I may sound crazy but I also bought their body wash liquid version (10 oz.) of this and I just top off and end my wash with some of this. I really just wanted to try it rather and it smells like this amazing Bengay/aroma scent that really clears your nasal passageway. BUT I'm sticking to this soap bar. Smells better, lasts longer.

The bar has what I think is like ground gritty type exfoliate in it. It feels nice on my skin and cleans well. Hubby's skin is definitely looking better, not his normal dry elbows anymore. We have hard water so it's hard on the skin. My hubby hates the feel of left over moisturizer that body wash leaves but he really likes this bar. He likes it so much its on auto ship. It does last well and he showers twice a day. It sounds pricey but not for what you get.",

                "reviewText": "I bought 5 different soap bars, from Jack Black Turbo Exfoliating Bar, Squatch Exfoliating Cedar, Anthony Soap Bar Exfoliating and Southern Natural Charcoal soap.Turbo bar is great overall - good exfoliating, good smell, good lather, just doesn't last too long for the amount it cost.I would say Marlowe and Jack Black are by far the best exfoliating bars and also probably the most expensive.Marlowe leaves you feeling of squeaky clean, not as good as the Jack Black, and gives you the best exfoliating like using a almost sandpaper.Anthony soap bar gives you the moisturizing and probably the gentlest exfoliating, just a bit better than the Dr. Squatch brand.Sent wise, they are all very light and not strong or long lasting. Again overall Marlowe and Jack Black stood out for me. Dr. Squatch smelt the worst in my opinion.Southern Natural Charcoal bar was interesting.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this soap bar and it arrived quickly. I absolutely love the scent of it and like other reviewers have been saying, this soap bar seems like its going to last for a long time. I have not used a soap bar that ever matches the quality of this. I primarily was using men's dove soap bars or AXE body wash (Never buying AXE again by the way). It creates a rich and somewhat thick lather especially when rubbed against hair (I have pretty hairy legs). It cleans very well. I would recommend the use of a loofah since it not only will increase the life of the bar, but it seems to work very well with the loofah, it creates the same thickness of lather. The reason I did not rate this 5 stars is because when I received the bar one of the corners had a pretty large dent in it. This most likely isn't the fault of Jack Black, it probably occurred while shipping.Pros:Long lifeSmells greatRich latherCons:Price (But the price seems to be well worth it)I plan on buying this again in the future and I would recommend it to everybody.",

But everyone is writing like it's the greatest thing since sliced bread.Come on guys! - It's good - the smell (like all Jack Black products) is awesome - BUT it doesn't stay with you - NOR should it (unless you just really want to smell like a bar of soap - NOT!). It's a perfect compliment to the liquid TurboWash. If you shower at the gym and you don't want to mess with liquid soap - this is a viable option.Pluses: It doesn't break down in a soap dish like other soaps do. It lathers great It has a great smell Its a hard version of the liquid soapMinuses: Its expensive (but then, how much is your body worth to you???) It's big and cumbersome to hold (ok, I don't have huge hands so i'm wondering how people with smaller hands deal with this) I'm good with the liquid",
