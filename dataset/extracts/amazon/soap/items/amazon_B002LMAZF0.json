But after making a batch and testing it out, I didn\u2019t continue using that homemade stuff (I also learned about the potential harms this kind of soap can do to a washing machine.)That being said, I have put the rest to good use, putting 1 bar in my shower, and another in the guest bathroom for hand soap. This is a super gentle soap that lathers nicely and doesn\u2019t have any scent so it\u2019s great for those looking to ditch the toxins.Normally I don\u2019t really use soap in my house or routine, but when things are extra dirty it\u2019s definitely nice to have soap for those instances.I would definitely buy this soap again, as it really is a clean and safe option for using in a multitude of ways.",
