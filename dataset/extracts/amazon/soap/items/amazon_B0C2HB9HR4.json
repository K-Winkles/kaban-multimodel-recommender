The only drawback is the size of the bars which is small for daily body use, but what can you do? And each bar has been sealed to within an inch of its life; as if the codes to enter Fort Knox were contained in each bar. I'm comforted knowing my soap is so heavily protected and secured.",

I'm wondering if I got a bad batch because people are on here raving about the scent, but I smelled nothing. It does lather nicely and didn't dry my skin out, I'll try one more time with this brand. Fingers crossed.",

                "reviewText": "Really liked it and it's mesh bag. It is gentle and has a beautiful light lemony fragrance.Weird & true story: I could not leave it out hanging to dry. This summer, I discovered that ants like it too. I thought it odd that I suddenly saw some ants around it where before I had not seen any anywhere else. I moved it to another location and there they were again. I then put it in a transparent plastic container and a few more showed up and were so drawn that some would go all around it trying to get in. I've read that ants don't like tumeric, lemongrass, nor lemon. What was making them so crazy about this soap? We still do not know.Anyway, since they liked it so much, we decided to leave a little piece of soap out surrounded by ant bait (Terro Ant Killer). They swarmed, ate it all & then disappeared. Did not see any more ants. It was much more effective than just using the Terro which we tried before putting out some of the soap. Highly recommend this if you want to get rid of intruder ants.BTW, thank goodness it doesn't attract them to your person when you bath with it. May buy again, but dare not gift it :-)",
