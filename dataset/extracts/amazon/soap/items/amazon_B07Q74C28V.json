                "reviewText": "Picture 1 is my skin a few months ago. You can see some of the oiliness on my nose and cheeks, a breakout on my chin, and overall just not a great skin tone. I don\u2019t ever use foundation or anything on my skin, so I thought this was just the skin I had to live with! Then last week, picture #2 happens all over my WHOLE BODY so I was desperately seeking some relief!I ordered this soap and have now been using it for one week, and I feel like my skin is entirely different! Picture #3 was taken at 11 pm after I just worked, I hadn\u2019t even washed or wiped my face, yet I had no oily buildup! It even had my partner questioning if I had started wearing a foundation.I finally pressured my partner to try the boar soap, and as soon as he came out of the shower he was hollering for me. His skin, beard, and body hair are so incredibly soft that we have both sworn to keep using this soap forever. I don\u2019t know what the magic ingredients are, but I cannot recommend it enough!",

                "reviewText": "I love the scent and lather of the soap, but it is definitely not good for seborrheic dermatitis. I\u2019d purchased a plain black soap by Ambi from the local hair store and loved the effects on my face when I incorporated it into my routine. Ambi has been trusted by my family for generations so I\u2019m never concerned about trying their products, this one just didn\u2019t work for me as a face soap. I think it might be the perfume used in this soap that irritates my skin, but immediately after using it I had a flare up. I tried it a couple more times to be sure, and it definitely is the soap causing the reaction. I will keep it as a body bar because I absolutely love the scent, but I\u2019ll have to keep looking for a face soap unfortunately.",
