                "reviewText": "I bought the 150g bar of the \u201cMilk\u201d scented PdP Bath Soap and my family loved. Smells awesome and washes well.I wrote to Pre de Provence\u2019s American distributor begging them to use the same scent in their shave soap. Naturally, I heard nothing and it was only a few weeks ago, but asking doesn\u2019t necessarily hurt.Flash forward to bath time and this 250g is being used and its creamy, shea goodness is just so rich and slick that I couldn\u2019t help thinking it would make a most excellent shave soap.It does! And it\u2019s very nice. No brush needed.More importantly, it\u2019s a great bath soap that triggers memories of cherished grandparents and I enjoy it more than any body wash or bath soap I\u2019ve ever used before. And my family likes it, too.",
