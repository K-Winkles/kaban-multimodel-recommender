Anyway at home we all use it, I keep one always aside my kitchen sink and we wash hands after coming back home, before eating, after gardening, etc.My hands don't get dry, it smells fine and it is a great brand used also in Europe as disinfectant where in its liquid form has been used for ages. The soap doesn't smell like the liquid dettol.Always get ONE and check if any ingredient can cause you allergy.",

Use of your really sticky and sweaty. But you can use it daily for armpit, butttt and feet... This is a great soap for ladies experience their monthly for both the privacy and of you have a spill on your clothes this neutralize the red color and make it dissappear like it never happened guaranteed.. This soap is definitely not for your face as it will dry out your pores. Best soap for washing hands to fight germs.. Keep one in you're shower along with your other soap of prefer. You'll know when you need to use it \ud83d\ude0e. this is definitely not a soap to use in winter. Unless it's for the touch up areas. You can also use it on the baby clothes, rub them up and soak for a few then toss in the washing machine and wash like normal. They'll smell fresh and look cleaner. And germ free. Thank you \ud83d\ude0ethis thing is magical",

                "reviewText": "The Dettol Anti-Bacterial Bar Soap, specifically the Re-Energize Fresh variant, is more than just a cleansing bar \u2013 it's a trusted companion that has been a part of my skincare journey since my youth. The impact of this soap on my skin's health is profound, and I have the evidence from the few years I temporarily discontinued its use.During the period when Dettol wasn't readily available in the U.S., my skin experienced an unwelcome shift. Acne breakouts and a general sense of skin unhealthiness became apparent. It was a revelation \u2013 a testament to the unique effectiveness of Dettol. Fortunately, discovering its availability on Amazon marked a return to the clear, healthy skin I had always known.Dettol's Anti-Bacterial Bar Soap has become a staple in my skincare routine, earning its place among my frequently bought items. The trust I place in this soap surpasses that of any other easily available anti-bacterial bar soap. For those seeking not just cleanliness but a proven ally in maintaining clear and healthy skin, Dettol stands head and shoulders above the rest. Embrace the time-tested purity, and let your skin thank you for choosing excellence.",

Great price, long lasting and no more skin issues.The smell of it a fantastic extra. For a few days, the bathroom smells very very nice.As a downside, the feel it leaves on the skin is strange for a few minutes. It feels \"not smooth\". It goes away in a couple minutes, though, so not an issue.I already bought a bunch.Will keep buying as my stock depletes.",
