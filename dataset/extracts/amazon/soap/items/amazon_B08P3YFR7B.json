                "reviewText": "I've had melasma and sun damage that popped up about 6 years ago (I'm 46 years old). It just seemed to get worse with every year and I never felt confident without makeup. Furthermore when I wore makeup, it barely covered my dark patches. I found this and took the advice to cut the soap in smaller pieces. I go through a small piece in about a month. I use this nightly however, I make sure my makeup is thoroughly removed and my skin is cleansed. I use this as a treatment. I suds it up in my hands and put it on my face, targeting my bad areas. I let it sit about 30 seconds to a full minute then I rinse. I do not use it in the morning, only at night. I've probably been at this about 6 months, using that routine consistently every night. This has completely gotten rid of almost all of my darkness. I have been able to leave the house without make and I feel my skin us the best it's ever been. When I do wear makeup, one light layer works fine as I do not have to cover anything anymore. I won't be without this soap. I have one small wedge left and I just reordered. If my story sounds like yours, give this a try and be consistent.",

After the first wash, I think my skin got used to it because it either didn't burn or was not as bad as the first time. Also, this soap dried out my skin but I just use a moisturizer after use. It does smell good/ok. No complaints about how it smells. Does it work? I only use this once in a while, i honestly don't know.",

I continued using because I though it was normal, but then my skin started burning, every night while applying my moisturizer, i had to put ice on my face to not feel the burn. if i get under the sun at any point, i feel like my face is on fire. I really wasn't able to continue using the soap anymore. but it really started helping. my face color started to even out. but unfortunately it's a no for me",
