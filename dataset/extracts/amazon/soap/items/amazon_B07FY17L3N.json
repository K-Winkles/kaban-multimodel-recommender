                "reviewText": "I have used this soap since I was a kid. Now this isn't nearly as strong of a fragrance than in yesteryear. But I don't mind. My only issue is the flaxseed oil. I don't like it. I don't like oil in my soap when I'm trying to remove my own oils on my body!! Plus that stuff leaches out of the soap, and makes the bars super slippery to hold on to. It lathers up well, still stings your eyes, and still cleans. The old recipe is gone, as I will be one day.....but I'll still remember the days of smelling \"Spring\" fresh all day, not a couple hrs.",

                "reviewText": "I've been a loyal user of this soap since childhood. Over the years, I've noticed the fragrance isn't as potent as it used to be, which is actually fine by me. However, I do have a gripe with the inclusion of flaxseed oil in the formula. It seems counterintuitive to have oil in a product meant to remove body oils, and this ingredient makes the bars quite slippery.Despite these points, the soap still lathers well and retains its effectiveness in cleaning, even if it does sting the eyes a bit. While the original recipe has changed, much like many things do over time, it still brings back memories of feeling fresh for hours, an experience that's now a bit more fleeting.",

The exfoliating version of this soap has little rough bits in it - almost like small grit from sandpaper. Its hard to tell if it really exfoliates, but I can report that it doesn't feel too rough on my skin.",
