Just don't drop it on your toe.The scent is great, and smells somewhat similar to Old Spice aftershave.The bar lasts a long time. Look at picture number 3 to see what it looks like after a month of use. Still pretty big.Finally, the box it came in was unexpected. It is a solid thick box with a magnetic clasp. See pictures #1 and #2. The box is so nice, I'm saving it to put coins in.Overall, I am very happy with the soap and will be ordering again.",
