Initially found it in an ethnic grocer and discovered I can buy online now that I do not live near that grocer any longer for many years. The quality is consistent and the scent is fresh and clean. Not like perfume, this is a clean scent. Somewhat moisturizing although I always wear moisturizer now living in southwest. I use on entire body, including face. It will dry face which may be good thing if you have oily skin and clogged pores. My current residence has very hard water and this soap rinses off with no residue. I will continue to purchase for many years. A single bar can last a very long time both as hand soap and in shower so you won't spend a lot of money reordering. The shape is easy to hold in hand.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this soap on a whim after seeing a YouTube video on how it's made. Sure enough, clicked on Amazon and there was the same soap. Couldn't remember what sandalwood smells like so took the chance to try this. It arrived today and when I smelled it my eyes went to the back of my head...the scent is amazing. Took it into the bathroom and opened the bar, set it on the edge of the tub and one of my kitties (who's into incense and scents) took to sniffing it, big long sniffs and she gave me a delightful look like she enjoyed it. Took my shower, let the soap sit on all pits and creases to trap the scent and kept smelling the bar. Kitty sat on the edge of the tub sniffing the soap when ever I set the bar down. Not too sudsy, you're not going to lather into a bubble cloud, rinsed fast and no after slime but the scent rinsed away way too quickly.I hope we will be able to buy a perfume made with this same oil. This scent is heavenly. Glad I have 12 bars and it seems like not much got used on this one so it may last quite a while. Would buy again.Rose used to be my favorite scent, now it's Sandalwood.**Hold the fort -- just took another shower (2 hours later) and boy-oh-boy, the sandal scent is even stronger and lingers on my skin afterwards. No dryness at all, just smooth soft silky skin. Rinsed clean. This time instead of a loofa I applied the soap bar to my skin and that seemed to work better for me. It was like a creamy slightly lathering foam. This time my other kittie walked right up to me to sniff me and sniffed a long time, then rubbed his face against my hand. They are loving the wood oil. I may look for real sandalwood stick so they can play with it. This is my absolute favorite scent. I just ordered the talc and the incense sticks. And the bathroom smelled amazing when I walked in for my second shower.Please make a body spray with sandal oil.This batch was manufactured on Oct 2017 and it's best used by 3 years from that date. *like it will last that long*P.S. - We have a water softener. May make a difference to some users.",
