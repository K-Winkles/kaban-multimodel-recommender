I have had problems with back acne for years and I started having issues with acne in my 20's on my face. So far i haven't been experiencing any skin problems since using this product. Lately it doesn't matter what soap product I use, it has been causing my skin to get irritated to the point some people have been asking if I have eczema. I don't know what happened but I never had that experience before until recently. But so far since using this product my skin feels exfoliated and soft. It smells realllyyyyyyyyy good and I haven't had any issues with my skin experiencing break outs or irritations . ***after full use update. after a week or so of using this people noticed a difference in my skin tone which seemed more even and it was clearing up my acne. After I received the compliments..i started looking at my skin more in detail and noticed a major difference. If you are having acne problems then this products will be good to purchase and if you need help with evening your skin tone. You want to make sure you put it in a plastic bag so that they black suds don't get every where while its drying or if you can find a bigger soap holder then that will work too because this is bigger than normal sized soap and worth the price. Just bought some more from Walmart but for some reason the product I purchased from there seems of so I will be buying more from this vendor just to compare and see if there is a difference or if just she moisture changed the product all together. Went back to regular products for a little bit and my skin went back to breaking out so I'm def sticking with this black soap because it did wonders for my skin.",

                "reviewText": "If you\u2019re acne-prone, have dry, and/or sensitive skin, this is the soap for you! I always keep a bar of African black soap in my shower ever since I first tried it and was wowed by its benefits three years ago. Compared to other brands of African black soap, this Shea Moisture brand is my favorite by far; I love this soap! I was suffering from mild-moderate acne on my back, as well as severe cystic acne on my face and this cleared it all right up within a few weeks of use. This soap is also incredibly moisturizing, so just because it gets rid of facial and body acne doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to dry out your skin. This is a perfect choice of soap to use in the winter time especially when skin is typically dryer due to the dry air. Obviously this soap maybe isn\u2019t a miracle, it does take some time to see results acne-wise, but you\u2019ll notice the moisturizing effects right away\u2014so much so you won\u2019t even feel the need to put lotion on after your shower! This soap lasts quite a long time as well; it\u2019s an 8oz bar, which is the same size as regular bar soap, so you don\u2019t have to worry just because it\u2019s \u201cspecial soap\u201d it\u2019s going to be smaller than normal. Additionally, the price point for being \u201cspecial soap\u201d is very reasonable at just over $3 per bar. I do still break out sometimes, but it\u2019s just hormonal, rather than every single day like it was before. Additionally, when I do breakout, it\u2019s not anywhere near as bad as before, and that\u2019s because this soap prevents inflammation, which stops breakouts from becoming as big, but also soothes existing breakouts, and also any zits that are in the healing stage. If you\u2019re getting desperate looking for something that finally gives your skin the results you\u2019re looking for, try Shea Moisture\u2019s African black soap. This stuff is so amazing, I promise you won\u2019t regret buying it! I can\u2019t recommend this soap enough!",

                "reviewText": "Word of warning, this is not real African black soap. So if you're looking for the real deal, move on elsewhere.I've gone to the dermatologist regularly for \"typical\" acne that was always kept under control by prescription products. In my early 20s, I developed cystic acne around my jawline due to my hormones going out of whack. I was prescribed some pills and sulfuric-based facial wash. That face wash made me gag and tear up, literally, every time I used it. And it seemed to have been making my acne worse!On a whim, I bought this product. I've seen people rave about it online so I decided to try it. The first time I used it, my face felt very soft and clean. I used it twice a day, along with witch hazel, and I would say that within 4-5 months, the cystic acne went away. I still get the occasional pimple and I wouldn't say that my skin is now super clear. But I don't get any big pimples anymore, just a small one here and there. I can't say that this soap helps much with dark spots though, unfortunately. But aside from that, I think this soap is wonderful! Based on other reviews, it's clear that it's not for everyone though. So use at your own risk.I do have a couple of tips.Sometimes when I wear heavy makeup, I feel like this soap doesn't do as good of a job of cleaning my face if I use solely my hands to clean. That's when a facial cleansing brush comes into play.I use a big knife to cut the soap up into 6 pieces. I find the small pieces easier to use and more hygienic. I wrap up the pieces I'm not using yet with parchment or wax paper and place it inside a Ziploc bag.I place the soap on top of a soap saver to keep it dry and not slimy-feeling. It can leave a black residue but just wipe it away with water and it goes away.Overall, I am a fan of this product. After about 1.5 years of use of simple soap and witch hazel, my skin is looking really pretty darn good! So great job, Shea Moisture!I am still a big proponent of going to a dermatologist and letting them handle whatever skin issues ails you though... Haha.",

But within a few weeks of using this bar consistently every day, I noticed my acne cleared up ALOT. Now it\u2019s been a year of using it and my face has cleared up 100%. Every night I use it and pair it up with a CeraVe moisturizer before going to bed.",
