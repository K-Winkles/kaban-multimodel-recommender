            "ALL NATURAL - Most big-name soap, isn\u2019t even soap at all, it\u2019s classified as synthetic detergent by the FDA. These detergents have little to no benefit to your skin, and can have negative effects on the environment. Swanky Badger Soaps are all natural GMO-Free and organic and sustainable as possible.",
            "SUSTAINABLE PALM OIL - The rise in bio-diesel & the need for edible non-hydrogenated oils has created a huge demand for palm oil. Palm oil is only harvested significantly in tropical rain forest regions & the potential for deforestation is the root of the problem. We use an organic palm oil which is a renewable & sustainable resource. Our palm oil is not as likely to contribute to the deforestation industry & our palm oil is farmed organically thus not polluting the land.",
            "GMO-FREE, VEGAN, & ORGANIC - Natural soap uses the best the earth has to offer, to nourish your skin and keep it healthy and hydrated. Our soap is GMO free, Cruelty Free and contains zero harsh chemicals. Compare our four primary ingredients (Olive Oil, Organic Sustainable Palm Oil, Coconut Oil & Shea Butter), to those of a leading body wash, and come to your own conclusions about what is best for your skin.",
            "MOISTURIZING - Swanky Badger Soaps don't leave the skin stripped of its natural oils, leaving it dry and ashy like the synthetic competitors. No need to have to buy moisturizer made with the glycerin the synthetic competitors extract from their cleaning products. Natural Soap retains its glycerin, to give a luscious moisturizing wash, big-brands strip this out of their products and replace it with synthetic lathering agents, creating an artificial lather, which dries out the skin.",
            "AVOID TOXIC CHEMICALS - Synthetic lathering agents aren\u2019t the only chemicals you should be aware of. Commercial soaps contain other toxic chemicals such as surfactants, parabens, artificial coloring agents and dyes. These chemicals can be toxic for people as they are absorbed through your skin and can cause diseases in the long run. One toxic chemical in particular, triclosan, has been shown to disrupt hormones and damage the reproductive system."

However, it has a rich lather and left my skin feeling really clean, but moisturized. Quality ingredients that nourish, not dry out skin. The heavenly scent filled the shower and it was like having my own little spa experience. So happy to have found my favorite scent in the perfect bar. I will definitely be ordering this soap again\u2026and most likely again after that!",

                "reviewText": "The texture of the soap is really nice and a little rough in a good way so I was able to really exfoliate my dry ass skin. On top of that the lather is really rich and instantly moisturizes your skin leaving you with a fresh feeling and the menthol gives you a little extra added comfort if you\u2019re one of those people that naturally is always hot, I personally used this soap on a really hot day and mind you I wasn\u2019t taking a cold shower either but the bone the less I felt nice and cool instantly after lathering it all over. My only complaint is the packaging it came in fell apart during the shipment so I would recommend the company make a stronger material for containing the soap.",

                "reviewText": "It has been a long time since I reviewed anything on here after nearly 800 reviews. I don't change soap or body wash a lot. I have tried Dr. Squatch and like it. I have tried the Mountain Ocean coconut soap and really liked it. I thought I would try something different. I was mainly looking at the scent. Anymore, I don't feel like most soaps or body washes get me that clean. I work outside most of the time. I have to get creative with the cleansing routine and usually use a non-scented antibacterial body wash or bar to get me clean. I then use one that smells good. I felt the cleanliness and moisturizing with the soap was similar to others I have used. I do recommend that Dove antibacterial body wash for extra dirty days. Then you can use one of these really nice smelling soaps. People, especially men, too often don't realize the bacteria on you is what causes the bad smells. If you don't get rid of the bacteria, you're just masking the filth on you.I always go for the aquatic or bluer scents. This one surprised me a lot. It is the Coral Reef scent. Years ago, I worked for Creed Boutique, I have a very strong olfactory (smell) sense. The scent this reminded me of was Creed Aventus in the older formulations of Aventus. That's a big compliment. Aventus soap is about forty to fifty dollars a bar. It doesn't have the longevity of Aventus soap or cologne. But for under ten dollars, this is a very good scent if you like the more sophisticated, but fresh scent. I really like this scent. It even has decent projection. I smelled it when I opened the shipping box. As a soap, I would give around a 4 star. As a scent it's a 5 star for me. It does have good exfoliating feel without being too rough. I always thought that was the best way to review soaps and body wash. Try to give you an idea of what it's going to smell like. Soap is soap. It lathers. It washes off. It scrubs you. That scent will put it on a regular rotation for me. I will buy more of this scent.",
