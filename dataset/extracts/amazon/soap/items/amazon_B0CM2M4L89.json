                "reviewText": "I don't use bar soap often when showering but liked the natural ingredients so, i figured I'd give them a try.They all smell nice, but have a slightly similar scent probably from being packed together. Some are more pungent than others, like the rose & oud soap.I have been using the laurel flavored soap for the last month and I have been impressed with how moisturizing these are. The soap does not disintegrate like others, and still is not even half gone. So these definitely have better longevity.The smell stays on the skin for a while and is quite strong while not extremely overpowering. I prefer less fragrance in soaps as I get headaches easily but great for most people that like smelly soaps.The design on the wrapping of each bar is really nice and unique. I like how each bar has a different Mediterranean design and color.I have not used these in my hair so I can't comment on how effective these are as a shampoo. The listing photo claims this is good for thinning hair and the scalp, but I am picky about my shampoos so I will probably not use these for that.These are lovely soaps and I do think the pricing is good considering you get 6 handcrafted, natural soaps. I know individually these type of soaps are a lot spendier.Maybe the only thing I'm not sure about is the color. These look cream colored/pale in the photos, but mine have color. Not a huge deal but I would rather these be colorless and plain since the soap scum is much more noticable when it's green or reddish. And yes, like all soaps these do leave soapy, slimey residue. Also if you look at the photo I took, there are splotchy colors on the green bars and discoloration around the edges of a few others. This might be from sitting in storage since the production date shows 10/2021. Or the olive oil could be the cause of the splotches.... Not sure, but otherwise they lather nicely and are definitely not dried out.Would I buy these in the future? To be 100% honest, probably not. The scents are nice but a bit too much for me. I prefer fruitier smelling soaps and I am used to the convenience of shower gels.Last thing is I wanted to find out where these were produced. Unfortunately the listing or wrapping does not say but I suspect these are from Turkey. I just wish this was listed. If anything I think that the company mentioning the soaps are made in Turkey is a selling point as it's a lot more exotic sounding than other places.",

                "reviewText": "These soaps remind me of something that you would find in a specialty boutique, making them stand out from your standard mainstream brands.You get 8 bars in the box in different fragrances - Rose & Oud, Pine Tar, Chamomile, Coconut & Seaweed, Peppermint & Eucalyptus, Laurel, Sandalwood, and Lavender.The soap is VERY strongly fragranced. I could smell the soap through the cardboard box, lol. So, if you like a lot of scent, you should be pleased with these. The scent is strong while washing but doesn't linger on your skin long after drying off. I found the scents to be very natural/herbal smelling which may not appeal to everyone. Since the soap is all packaged in the same box, a lot of the scents kind of meld together so I didn't find that they smelled the way they were probably intended to.The bars are dense and lather up nicely.I was pleased with how my skin felt after washing with this soap. It was left feeling clean, soft, smooth, and moisturized. It didn't leave behind any slimy residue nor did it leave my skin feeling dried out. (which happens when using many mainstream brands of bar soap)The bars of soap are each individually packaged making them suitable for breaking up into individual gift bags or baskets.",

                "reviewText": "I recently had the pleasure of purchasing this pack of artisanal soaps, and I must say, I was thoroughly impressed with every aspect of it. The pack contains so many bars of soap, each with a unique scent that was both different from the others and quite impressive. I loved the fact that they were all made from natural ingredients that are both suitable for sensitive skin, but can be used by everyone. This generous pack would make an excellent gift as the packaging is better than most!Although the pack contained some scents that are clearly geared more towards men, I was surprised to find that most of them worked well for women too, making this pack ideal for a household with both sexes. The wide variety of scents was truly impressive, and I could tell that the company had put a lot of thought and effort into the making of each bar.Each bar was a generous size, and using just one has lasted me at least a few weeks. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the company had integrated superior ingredients in each bar of soap, making them not only great for cleansing, but also great for nourishing for the skin.Using these soaps has created a spa-like experience for me, and I am excited to have made this purchase. While some of the scents were more subtle, they were still natural and well thought out. I appreciated that the company had taken the time to create a pack that was both practical and luxurious at the same time.Overall, I believe this pack would work well in a household with both men and women of different ages. It is quite evident that the company has put a lot of effort into creating an exceptional product that can be enjoyed by all.",
