                "reviewText": "Best Purchase! NO LIES! For 20+ years my husband has been battling psoriasis all over his body. From his head to his knees and everywhere in between. Poor guy!! He's tried everything from otc ointments to prescription. Don't get me wrong.......the prescription ointments worked but they were VERY oily and greasy. He endured it for many many years to control his breakout. It would be a constant battle.THEN......one night while cruising Amazon i (wifey) came across this soap. I read many many reviews and compared other products too. But decided to take a chance with this brand.Well.....BEST DECISION AND PURCHASE EVER!!Told my husband \"hey try out this new soap and let me know how you like it\"WELL, he just started like 2 weeks ago AND BOY WHAT AN IMPROVEMENT! Really NO JOKE! He just said \"hey what do think\" Man im so amazed. Skin looks great. No bright skin, less crust and most all breakout areas fading! AMAZING!!!If its this easy to clear psoriasis....why dont the Doctors reccomend this product!! Go figure!!!If your battling psoriasis and tried everything like we did. Take a chance and purchase this product. Just try it. He hasnt tried it on his head yet.....not sure why. But im sure he will. It is a little pricey for a bar of soap but you know what....its $$ well spent. I subscribed to this item and im VERY VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE. Too bad i didnt see it sooner.Also, he only uses it 1x a day.....mornings. Sometimes 2x. Easy peasy.....no greasy or oily ointments. Oh also, no smell.Delivery was awesome with Prime. Thank you Amazon!!",
