So far so good in regards to the horrible dry scalp & skin my 15 year old son has suffered from since he was a baby. The tea tree and eucalyptus scents are noticeable/ not offensive and seems to be the reason along with the black soap as to why I feel it works best for my son's skin type. Despite it being dark from the African black soap, it will rinse out of your wash clothe. I use white wash clothes and it rinses out very well leaving no dark residue on the wash clothe. . It is concentrated, which I like. This is based on my opinion. I will continue to buy this product. So far, I'm very pleased with using this soap that my family can use from head to toe..",

I prefer this texture over castille soap. This soap is more moisturizing than your traditional castille soap. My only issue is the smell. It is not tangerine it is lemongrass. I actually love lemongrass scent I\u2019m not too concerned but it is extremely strong. I mean it smells like a whole bottle of it was dumped into this. So it more on the multipurpose cleaner side of smell. I gave it 4 stars due to the smell. But for now I really like it and use it mainly in the bath",

The main disappointment was it highly lacked lather and it was like in order to get some lather (which doesn't last long at all especially when added to a soft loofa in regards to this product) you have to apply alot and it's thin despite it appearing like a creamy texture that gave off an impression \"a little goes a long way\" & was going to have a rich lather that made nice bubbles that lasted long on the body etc that wasn't the case at all. Another thing was it did clean & rinse off of the body & face etc but you must litterly rinse throughouly. Overall I'll use it until I run out it wasn't for me.",
