Bars of soap have been shrinking over the years as the liquid soaps have taken over, and when I held this bar up to a bar of Lever that I had, there's a noticeable size difference.This soap builds a really good lather and one bar lasts quite a while. I like the eucalyptus smell of the bar and the soap doesn't leave an oily film on you but it doesn't completely dry your skin out like some of the mainstream soaps can.This is now going to be main go-to soap.

Look it up if you don't believe me or correct me if I'm wrong about that study. Anyways this is all natural which is good. Only thing that sucks...a bar doesn't last that long.
