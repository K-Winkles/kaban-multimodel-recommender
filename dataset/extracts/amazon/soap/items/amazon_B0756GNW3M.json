I had don't everything over the counter I could, and everything else I knew to do to my stuff at home..hot water to wash, changing socks frequently, cLysoled my work shoes...it was just getting worse. I started using this God send, and in two days I could already feel a difference. This soap is lightly scented, lathers very well, but needs to be allowed to dry in bw uses. After almost two weeks of using, it's all but gone. My feet look 10000% better thanks to this soap. It probably literally saved my feet. Buy it!!",

That being, I stopped using the product because of my situation, but the product might be good for someone else. I couldn't give the product 5 stars, but I didn't want to give it 1 star either; so I stayed in the middle.",

Its is an exceptional product. I'm onto my second bar of soap and have already ordered another 6 (panicked for a moment when it was showing as no longer available on both the Amazon and Solar sites) - but the new stock is in and all is good in the World :-). The product has a great smell, it really, really lathers up, and I just feel so totally clean after I shower. The soap bar is very \"soft\" so it can seem to vanish - recommend you keep it away from the shower stream. Others recommend cutting it up into smaller pieces to make it last longer... either way, this is an exceptional soap, and it will significantly reduce any general BO or other athlete related \"issues\".",

I really hated using oily, smelly creams; so this was a fantastic find! There\u2019s no gross residue, and it actually smells quite good. I keep my soap in a standard plastic soap box when I\u2019m not using it, and I\u2019ve used less than 1/3 of the bar in the last month, so I\u2019m very happy with the value and the overall result!",
