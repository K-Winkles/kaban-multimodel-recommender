                "reviewText": "I've been using a natural soap made by another company, I wont name names but lets just use an alias: Big Foot, MD. Their soaps are nice, smell great BUT they generally cost over $8/bar and last a week (im 6ft 200lb man). I needed to make a switch so I found Australian Botanicals, read about their soaps, they offer a variety of real natural soaps I purchased an 8 pack of hefty bars (I think weigh 3x's as much as Big Foots) for $22! I've been on my first bar for over a month! Do the math, waaaay cheaper than Big Foots. The goats milk bar has a creamy, milky, somewhat vanilla sent. Not \"manly\" like big foots but smells great. I haven't tried their others (yet). This soap lathers great, it feels like you're rubbing a smooth, creamy lather of whipped cream on you. My skin feels great throughout the day too. A+++ for this company making a great product at a fair price!",

                "reviewText": "I have a hard time finding a soap I can use on my face that will not only remove makeup, but will also not make my face break out. I have used Dr B\u2019s peppermint bar soap for years, but lately it\u2019s just too expensive. Five dollars a bar for soap! It\u2019s too pricey for me.I had to find a new soap that I could afford. So, the search was on. I read through so many reviews for so many different soaps \ud83e\uddfc I ordered a few different brands and types, but they just didn\u2019t do what I needed. There was one that smelled lovely and made my skin soft, but I\u2019d have to scrub my face nearly raw to get it to take off my makeup\ud83d\udc84, particularly mascara. I don\u2019t use much makeup when I do apply it, so it was disappointing. And that must mean the soap didn\u2019t get the rest of the stuff off my face and body that I collect throughout the day.I saw this Australian soap and the reviews were promising, so I took another chance at another new soap. The bars are very large and I still haven\u2019t even gotten the first bar I used halfway down. This box is going to last a very long time. It leaves my skin feeling soft. There isn\u2019t very much of a scent and I\u2019m glad about that because I\u2019m sensitive to strong aromas.I have oily skin on my face on my T-Zone and this soap actually makes my skin a bit dry, but I use a facial moisturizer so that solves that. The one day I didn\u2019t use the moisturizer, my face quickly softened and the dryness disappeared. I haven\u2019t broken out from it and since I\u2019ve been using this every day for a few weeks, I know I won\u2019t break out.It removes my makeup with minimal \u201cscrubbing\u201d and it was so inexpensive! And there were a lot of bars in the box! Doesn\u2019t get any better than that. Hopefully in the case you order this it\u2019ll work well for you too.",

I don't notice the scent lingering on my skin. I like this because it doesn't clash with any other scents, like deodorant or whatever I'm using to moisturize my skin.It worked great on my summer skin, and was wonderful through the change in season. My skin usually gets dry patches when it starts getting cold, but I didn't get any this year.The bar is long lasting and holds its shape well. Stays right on its little soap dish and doesn't make a mess.It's a great price and a great product. I definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not sure if it is just me. I may have really dry skin. These soaps are good, but I was expecting more moisture, and that it would last longer. I'm not sure what the quantity of goat milk used on this. But to me, it seems almost like a regular soap. The soaps are a very good size, for the price, I think it is a good deal. But again, I guess it is just that my skin is very sensitive and dry. I would recommend it, if you're only looking for a regular soap. Their scent is very nice.",

That tells me they also care for the environment. Best part no harsh chemicals and not tested on animals.I ordered 8 soaps. Upon opening the box immediately a very beautiful, unique aroma was noticed. The soaps are smooth coated with their brand company letters on top, the back says made in Australia and have flower pattern designs on the sides. Definitely well made! It\u2019s not cheap. However, you do get what you pay for. I would say it\u2019s affordable and fair at the current price of $25.99. I wouldn\u2019t buy if it were higher than that. Only if they included more soaps. Anyway, I would recommend buying and trying it out for yourself.",

Best to stock up on it when you can. On the plus side, the bars are large and dense, not pumped full of air. They last quite a long time. And they don't overpower with strong odors either.",
