What I like most about it is the non-cloying fragrance. So many hand soaps contain fragrance that is far too strong. This soap does contain fragrance (I selected the Pacific Eucalyptus) but it\u2019s understated and pleasant. When you\u2019re preparing meals and washing hands frequently, that\u2019s a real plus. And the essential oils and natural ingredients are a plus, too! Very pleased with this purchase. Thinking about putting this on Subscribe and Save. Check it out!",
