It\u2019s tough to know which size is best sometimes, but the larger ones will work fine for smaller coils.I will probably buy another set as I am getting better organized.

I recommend going for the all 16\" pack for a more straightforward and effective cord organization solution. Overall, a sturdy and reliable choice.",

They are good for water hoses and long air hoses though.Would buy again",
