                "reviewText": "So, I got these two new super-bright LED lights for my place. Installing them was a bit tricky, not gonna lie, but once I got them up, it felt like I'd unlocked a whole new level of lighting.These lights are like the superheroes of brightness \u2013 they light up my shop like it's daytime even when it's pitch dark outside.And the best part? They're like the overachievers of light bulbs. They do their job flawlessly, no flickering or weird stuff. It's like having your own personal lighting crew making sure everything looks awesome.Yeah, setting them up was a bit of a puzzle, had to rewire my shop a little, but now that they're shining bright, it's clear they're the MVPs of my home lighting situation. Bright, hassle-free, and making my place look way cooler than before.",

                "reviewText": "I was a little hesitant to buy something cheap from China, but a friend had bought a pair of these and liked them. There really was no installation to speak of. It's just like screwing in a light bulb. The light output is great, and the light is a very bright white, which throws distinct shadows. Perfect for my garage work. I also like the adjustable arms that allow me to direct the majority of the light where I need it most in the garage. Hard to comment on the longevity at this early stage, but so far I'm very pleased, and the price was certainly reasonable.",

                "reviewText": "Longevity remains to be seen.Very bright, white light.The listed numbers for wattage, 160w and 16k lumens are not very useful.Not even for the 2 fixtures combined.A watt meter tells me one of these is pulling about 53w at the wall which means it could have the lighting capability of 2 or more 150w Incandescent bulbs.I don't have any way to measure lumens, but a 5.2k number does not seem out of line based on the wattage comparison for incandescent bulbs.There is not a lot of heat based on the amount of light I am seeing. 10w incandescent bulbs are hotter than this.The panels are made from very heavy gauge plastic and are well put together.Pay attention to the measurements. They are no where near the size they appear to be in the garage and shop illustrations. I don't see that as a problem, as the performance is still very good for the size.",

The included light sockets didn\u2019t work for me because I needed something that would mount to an existing electrical box, the included ones did not so I had to purchase ones that did. Also be careful screwing them in the socket, the threads are very thin/soft and easily damaged but they are bright!! Longevity remains to be seen.",
