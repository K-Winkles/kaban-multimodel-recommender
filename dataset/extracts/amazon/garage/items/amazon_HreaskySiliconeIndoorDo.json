                "reviewText": "I bought this to use as a doormat, but then I got thinking it might make a good litterbox mat and it does! I had to work a bit with my cats to get them to walk on it but they accepted it pretty quickly. It does the best job of anything I've ever tried of trapping the litter that gets out of the box so that it can't scatter across the floor. Then it's easy to shake it out. You need to be careful picking it up because it's so floppy but the debris shakes right out of it. Now and again I hose it off. Super easy to clean. The only thing is that it's a bit narrow as a litter mat. I use it with the narrow end at the box opening. For now I have a real litter mat under it as a backup but I barely need to shake that one off since this works so well. It would be great if the manufacturers would consider making a wider version. But even as it is it's good and I most likely will buy more.",

                "reviewText": "Hreasky Silicone Indoor Door MatWe have been looking for an indoor mat that we could also use for the snowy days in Illinois. This door mat is perfect for that.It looks good, is easy to clean, and even the dirt from the bottom of our shoes gets caught in the little nubs of the rug.This has decreased the amount of clean-up time I have to spend in the sun room, and I really appreciate that.I love, love this mat and will purchase again, if I have to.",
