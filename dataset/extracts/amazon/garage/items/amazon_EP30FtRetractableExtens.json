Instructions say you can install as is or cut the plug to wire direct. i installed this in a 30 minutes though to be fair i do have difficulty getting around and cant climb ladders so you might be able to install this much faster if you are in better shape that i am. All you need to do is screw the bracket into a stud in the ceiling and then use the included pin to hang the cord roll. i did substitute a cotter pin for what they provided since it would make installing it easier and removal just as fast if needed. Cable is a bit difficult, initially, to roll back up until you get the hang of it then it does so easily. Even a small red status light on it to indicate if it has power so you can always tell it is working. My only suggestions for future revisions is to make the ball stopper is to make it easier to move back down again if desired. i need to get it to move up a bit as i keep bopping my head on the cable. LOL. Recommend to al for the price!",

I was extremely impressed with this extension cord. It does exactly what I needed it to do. I mounted it to the ceiling and attached it to a fabric cutting saw. Before I had the ceiling mount there was always the danger of cutting the cord. Now that the cord is retracted towards the ceiling it always keeps the cord away from the cutting blade. Much safer for the operator, and prevents damaging the cutting tool. Definitely recommend this product.",
