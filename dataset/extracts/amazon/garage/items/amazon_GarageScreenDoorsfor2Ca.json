                "reviewText": "We set up a ping pong area in our basement and I didn't want a lot of blue tarps blocking the circulation of air causing a musty condition. This screen door is the perfect solution. It is lightly weighted at the bottom and the magnetic \"door\" works well. The magnet door sticks to a nearby lolly column when not in use making it easy to walk around without having to roll it up. That said, rolling a side up and clipping it up out of the way with the three straps actually works well too.I installed it with the provided tacks and that was simple and quick.",

It takes quite a bit of force to get through the center as the magnets are very strong.That being said, the magnets constantly stick to the garage door if a light breeze blows up against it. We had to get a magnetic strip for the bottom to keep the net from floating back on to the garage door.",
