                "reviewText": "I have purchased, installed and used seven different magnetic screens over the last five years, and I can honestly say that THIS IS THE BEST MAGNETIC SCREEN DOOR FOR YOUR 2 CAR GARAGE!!The screen is made from very sturdy and strong material -it doesn\u2019t rip easily! The Velcro is pre-sewn into the screen, and the Velcro that comes with the kit that attaches to the door surround is easy to work with, of very high quality, and lasts for YEARS! I\u2019m replacing my old screen, but not the Velcro around my door! The original Velcro is still going and holding strong!The Velcro that goes across the top of the door frame is thicker than the Velcro along the sides! This is a great feature as it allows you to hang the dead-center (where the screen opens) an inch or two higher than the rest of the top, without having to try to arch the Velcro! It also gives it even better staying power! This screen is the perfect size for use around a 2 car garage! It is listed as being 16\u2019 by 7\u2019, but actually even the one listed as such, is actually 16.3\u2019 by 7.15\u2019, -which is great, as the extra inches are often needed to get a proper fit! (A 16\u2019 panel will not cover a 16\u2019 opening! U need an extra inch or two on each side to reach the sides where the Velcro goes)!I just ordered my second one of this same screen last night, and it arrived this morning before noon! I couldn\u2019t believe the price it is selling for right now- under $50!!! I paid $85 for my original screen, and felt it was a great deal for that price! For the current sale price of $47, I\u2019m half tempted to order 10 more! They really are the best available -trust me, I tried several others before finally finding this one, the best of all! I ordered this second screen because the original eventually got too many little rips in it from my husband being careless, and catching it with sharp tools! I sewed each the rips up, and that worked just fine, but I decided I wanted a nice new one for when guests come over! This screen turns our garage into an enjoyable bonus room! It keeps ALL bugs outside!!!There are more magnets in this screen than any of the others I\u2019ve tried, and these magnets are bigger, stronger, and sewn the fabric! It closes tightly and completely! NO BUGS CAN GET IN! This screen also has several little weights sewn into the bottom, which help to hold it in place -I\u2019ve found that moving one weight to each far side, and one right at the opening of each side, really helps everything stay in place and close quickly/immediately behind you!This screen also has several little clip ties on the top of the screen that allow u to roll the screen door up and secure it, when you need it out of the way! It\u2019s a nice feature that many other brands do not have!If you are shopping for the best magnetic screen door for your 2 care garage, (or equivalent size opening), search no further!THIS IS THE ONE U WANT!",

                "reviewText": "I was skeptical after reading so many reviews on different products. I was purchasing this for my elderly parents who would not be comfortable bending down to unzip a door every time they came in and out. They live in myrtle beach and have a constant breeze so I was also concerned about it being blown open all the time. I am happy to say that overall we were very satisfied with this screen. My parents have a standard 2 car garage. Fit was perfect. All the pieces expected were in the package when it arrived. Installation took about 30 min, with two people. The Velcro included is of good quality and worked appropriately. Due to how often they go in and out of their garage and their breezes, we did choose to buy the U shared nails just to add additional security. The adhesive of the Velcro seemed appropriate but we wanted to play it safe. The magnets for the door opening worked very well. Closing by themselves after walking through. I have to say my only complaint is that once they close their garage door, if the wind blows the magnets stick to the garage door, and when they push the button to raise the door they are often fearful the screen will rip down, but so far so good. Still trying to think of a solution to keep it from magnetizing to their garage door. My sister and I installed this two weeks before Christmas ,so its been up almost a month now and we are still happy with this purchase. For the money we paid I felt this was a very well made product.",

                "reviewText": "This screen is great and easy to install. There's a part I skipped over, as the directions are picture-less and very short and simple, about where on the frame to install the velcro. I initially installed the velcro on the wrong part, so the magnets stuck to the door every time it would open or close. It became a pain, but the screen was worth it. When I realized I thought something was amiss, i read the directions again and realized I installed them wrong. I did have to read it several more times to realize what it was saying.Great product, but more clarity in the directions would be helpful.",
