                "reviewText": "This is a well designed and well manufactured product. Particularly impressive is how well the bolt holes and threaded holes line up (it is all too common in many products that holes are misaligned, which requires you to enlarge them by drilling or filing - none of that with this shelving.) Having a ratchet wrench with a 13 mm socket made it a lot easier to attach the mounting brackets to the ceiling. Also, having a second person makes the job go 2-3 times faster. The instructions are reasonably clear overall; as others have noted, the layout and positioning of support brackets on the ceiling is the most time-consuming. After that, the installation proceeded smoothly. One minor glitch for 22 inch high shelving: I found a slight interference between the 2 pieces of the vertical support brackets. While they probably could be bolted together to function OK (or trimmed to fit), I used a 23 inch height, which worked perfectly. The shelving is very sturdy and has cleared a lot of \"stuff\" from our garage floor. I worried that the area might feel claustrophobic, but with the white finish and overhead clearance, that has not been a problem. We should have done this years ago!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Know your garage before you buy",
                "reviewText": "I just recently installed the 8' x 4' Fleximount storage rack. What I liked: (1) the product appears to be of good quality, nice looking black finish. (2) it\u2019s packaged nicely, with all parts numbered and in separated plastic bags, (3) there is an ability to vary rack height to 40\" maximum; (4) the storage is large and spacious. What I disliked: (1) no washers included for use between the mounting racks and lag screws (I ended up using my own); (2) somewhat vague instructions; (3) overall installation difficulty.The rack is mounted to the ceiling via six provided mounting brackets. You can mount these in parallel (three brackets each into two joists that are 48\u201d apart) or perpendicularly (six brackets mounted across three pairs of joists that are 24\u201d apart). I highly recommend you understand where your joists are in your garage before purchasing. It might be the orientation you want may not be possible given the orientation and spacing of your joists.Like most DIY projects, measurement is critical to success. Installation of the ceiling mounts is straightforward- finding the joists occupied more of my time than actually installing the brackets. My ceiling is textured and painted so it wasn\u2019t obvious. In my case, I installed perpendicularly. Installation of the vertical mounts was a snap- though you have to make sure all mounts are 48\u201d apart. The absolute hardest thing to do was to get the floor of the rack installed. The manual suggests assembling the pieces into the 8\u2019 x 4\u2019 length, lifting it onto the support arms, and then tightening the screws. This was not possible for me as I was working alone. The fully assembled rack flooring is super heavy and awkward. Furthermore, the dangling vertical arms are not stable enough to hold the platform while you are moving a ladder around tightening screws. I think this would be hard even with two people (as the manual recommends). What I ended up doing was mounting the first 4\u2019 x 4\u2019 segment of the flooring into place. Once this was secure, I added the second 4\u2019 x 4\u2019 segment into place and secured it to the first with the provided screws. This was not easy either! Lifting the 4\u2019 x 4\u2019 flooring while on a ladder was definitely precarious. I had to utilize bungee cords to attach to the vertical arms and the flooring to hold the platform in place while I moved the ladder around tightening all the screws.There is a little bit of wobble in the platform but not necessarily anything that worries me. Overall, I am happy with the way it looks and the storage volume is definitely spacious. One last note. A lot of people prefer to install storage in the area just above where the garage door rolls up. Keep in mind this may limit your storage volume. I decided against this because I only had something like 15 inches to the ceiling.",

However, I was pleasantly surprised at how straightforward it was. With clear and concise instructions provided, it took me about 4 hours to set up the entire system. The instructions were easy to follow, making the assembly a hassle-free experience even for someone like me who doesn't have much DIY expertise.One of the standout features of this storage rack is the material quality. The rack is sturdy and well-built, ensuring durability and reliability. I felt confident storing my belongings on it without worrying about the rack's stability. The adjustable design allowed me to customize the rack according to my garage height, providing ample space to organize various items in my garage.",

                "reviewText": "Installation was not necessarily easy, but that was likely due to the configuration of our joists. Took a couple hours with an assistant, but once up it works great! I am hoping it holds everything up there, but it tends to sway a little when adding items, and that makes me less than confident . But I went through and verified each bolt is correctly installed to a joist and all other fasteners are tight. It is installed correctly, but still has some sway and crackling sounds to it. Likely just some paranoia on my part, but so far so good. I may wedge a 2x4 under it to give extra support, but probably not necessary. Overall, I recommend this product as it has really helped clear space on the floor of our garage!",

This also makes it vulnerable if your are in an area prone to earthquakes.For installation I couldn't trust the stud finder to locate the studs as the insulation in the ceiling causes the stud finder get confused. The main anchors that are connected to the ceiling joists are large and they must be installed exactly on the centerline of the joists otherwise their load capacity could be compromised.
