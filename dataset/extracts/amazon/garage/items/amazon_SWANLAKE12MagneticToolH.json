                "reviewText": "These magnetic tool holders worked well for me. They replaced some that I had for years, that didn't have nearly the same holding power as these do. I use them to hold drill bits, saw blades and some larger items. For those reviewers that said they don't hold heavier tools, they weren't supposed to. You can't put a hammer or a pipe wrench on these and expect it to hold. It's a magnet... a pretty strong magnet, but not effective for large tools. I have a lot of my drill bits on these and it takes a little pull to get the bit off the magnet... and that's a good thing. On my old magnetic holder, if I brushed against the bits, two or three or more would fall off. I'd be searching for them in the pile of stuff on my workbench. These magnets hold. I also used them in my basement where I keep my sets of keys for doors and my cars. They hold easily and don't fall off. I bought four of these. I probably will buy four more. Don't take the plastic covering off the magnetic. The magnets are strong enough to hold whatever you put on, providing you're not trying to hold a drill or pipe wrench. These are five star holders, if used in the way they were meant for. I bought these... I didn't receive them for free in order to write a positive review. I wrote a positive review because that is what i experienced with these.",
