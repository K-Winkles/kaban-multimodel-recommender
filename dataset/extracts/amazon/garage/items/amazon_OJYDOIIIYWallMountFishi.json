The band system makes it so easy to put the rods up and secure them! One thing I will say is to measure all the rods so that the eye hooks clear the top or bottom of the holder with the band. We had to move one bottom stand higher for the shorter poles and we had to adjust the stand with the longer poles to avoid one of the eye hooks but it was really simple to do. I hope you sell the o-rings as I am sure in time they will wear out due to heat and cold. I am grateful you put extra O-rings in for emergencies too! Great product!! Thanks!",

                "reviewText": "Very cheap and flimsy. The hardware included was not long enough for the product. Space between rods is too small. Realistically, you can fit 3 \"adult sized\" rods.Tip: mount the device to a board so that it moves farther away from the wall. It will prevent the reels from banging the wall.",
