                "reviewText": "I love velcro and carabiners for hanging things usually, but this is a nice design with the large rings (for hanging on hooks) and the wide strap. I don't love that the rings are plastic, but they are thick and sturdy with NO flex to them. The product description says they hold 50 pounds so I expect them to hold up well. The straps are thick and probably over-engineered a bit, that's a good thing! There's a lot of hook-and-loop (Velcro) material on the strap so they hold together really well and are fairly adjustable. I do wish the straps were a little longer, so you could wrap a larger item and still use all of the velcro.On a final positive note, the price is great! I have some single straps that cost as much as this heavy-duty 3 pack.Note I'm reviewing \"Aokeyee Extension Cord Holder(3Pack),Heavy Duty Straps Fit Easily on Hooks, Hook and Loop Storage Straps for Garden Hose Storage and Garage Wall Organization\" - not the wall-mounted rack that seems to be currently mixed up with this item.",
