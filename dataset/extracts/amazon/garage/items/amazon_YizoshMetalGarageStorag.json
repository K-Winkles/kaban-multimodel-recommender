                "reviewText": "I ordered these to start getting a handle on my amazingly messy garage. They come in a very heavy package - 90lbs. But they are very, very well packed - there are even stainless steel metal ends. The handyman I hired to help put it together was impressed too. Once together, they're really sturdy and can handle most anything you throw at them. There was still minor shipping damage but I didn't buy these to show off, so it worked out fine, they're still fit for purpose. The locks also use bars that go into the top and bottom (as opposed to a lip that goes into the opposing door), so that's pretty well designed as well. The lock has a green and red indicator that shows whether it's locked or not, which was a nice touch.Only a couple minor issues - the lock itself is very cheap and not very secure, though that really isn't too important. Could probably be very easily picked. It's in my garage so I don't care about that. It also would be nice if it came with casters, but there are screw on feet so that would be an easy modification. And the instructions, while comprehensive, are still a tiny bit confusing and could be a little clearer in places.I'm pretty happy with these, and the price is right, especially considering free shipping.",

                "reviewText": "For the price, I would definitely recommend buying this product. I bought this and was so satisified with it that I later bought a second one. Both times the item was delivered earlier than the date given at checkout. Both boxes were packed with special metal inserts in the ends of the boxes to keep the edges from being damaged during shipping. Everything was packed well and clearly marked. The instructions were very well thought out and very easy to read and understand. It only took me around 30 minutes to assemble the first one and then 20 minutes to assemble the second one. I like that the product comes with special feet that allow you to adjust the height on all four corners. This came in handy because the floor in the area I was placing these was uneven in one spot which made one of the doors not want to close properly, once it was moved into place. A simple turn of a screwdriver to lower the foot fixed the problem and the door latched perfectly. These are very sturdy, well made, and hold a large amount of items. The pieces that hold the shelves are very easy to remove and adjust if you need more space. My only suggestion would be not purchase this product if your going to be placing them in a high traffic area where children may be playing and throwing things. That is because the metal on the doors is not very thick and could possibly dent easily if hit with something. But if your placing them in an area where there isn't a ton of foot traffic, you won't have any issues with this.",

                "reviewText": "Nearly everything about this cabinet is good - really well packaged, very clear assembly instructions, assembly is easy, final product is sturdy, the doors stay closed when closed and open when open, and it looks nice, too. The locks are pretty basic and will just barely keep honest people honest, but I didn\u2019t buy it for lockable doors anyway. I am totally happy and would (might soon) buy it again without reservation.So, why 4 stars, you ask? Well now, there are a few things that could be better, so grab a cup of whatever tastes good and let me explain.First, despite excellent packaging and no damage to the exterior box, several panels had dents and scuffs on them. I believe this happened at the factory since some panels were interior ones. Nothing so bad that you\u2019d notice it from 5 feet away but it\u2019s there. I\u2019m using this in my workshop so it doesn\u2019t bother me enough to send back. But they\u2019re present.Second, this particular package lacked the four small metric nuts required to assemble the back panels. Thankfully I have a good stock of fasteners and just grabbed my own, but it would have been frustrating to be stymied on step #1 if I didn\u2019t.Next, all the doors have magnets to hold them closed (I like!) but the left doors have a lip so that they are locked closed by the right side doors. Fine, but it means you have to open the right side to open the left side. Not a huge thing, just not what I would prefer. I\u2019d rather have no locks and be able to open any door independently.Finally, it does come with four rubberized adjustable feet, but I had the feet all the way screwed in (raised) when I stood the cabinet up for the first time. This meant the exposed steel screws in the bottom of the cabinet were the first things to touch down and immediately scratched my flooring. That sucked. You can blame me for it - I do - but learn from my booboo and make sure the rubber feet extend down below the bottom of the steel screws before you upright it.Holds a lot, completely stable so far, looks good. Happy man here!",

                "reviewText": "Bought this for our garage to keep extra kitchen gadgets. Previously we just had all this stuff sitting on open shelving, but the garage gets dusty from the garage door being open during the day. Decided a closed cabinet would be a better solution. Thought about the cheapy Rubbermaid plastic cabinets, but they're not too sturdy. Saw this when browsing Amazon for cabinets --- the price was right and it arrived quickly and was well packaged with no dents! Putting it together was fairly simply. Lock mechanism is not going to be utilized, but certainly a \"plus\" factor for some other folks. Overall, I am extremely pleased with this cabinet. Looks great in the garage and the closed doors make for a tidy look, as well as keeping our pots and pans, etc. clean.",
