                "reviewText": "Purchased this parking laser guide knowing it would be a simple and uncomplicated product. I found the unit to be made very lightweight, however very sturdy. I mounted the unit onto the bottom of my garage door opener, since I wanted a cleaner install. We only have one car, so I mounted the unit sideways and use one laser for when I drive straight in and the other laser the other direction in case we back in. Both are aimed for a spot on the dashboard. The red laser is very bright and large enough even on the dark dashboard. I took a picture of it on the floor which is approximately 20 feet away from where it is mounted on the opener. Another reason I mounted the unit sideways was so that the sensor would be more sensitive on one side of the garage than on the other side, so I could go along my workbench area without activating it. The unit shuts off after approximately 30 seconds just as described. Definitely would buy this unit again. It wasn\u2019t the least expensive and they all looked the same, but I figured you get what you pay for and this particular laser had lots of purchases with great reviews.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this unit because it looks like a very good idea, but it did not work as well as I expected and a much simpler and cheaper solution works better for us.First, despite the \"wide angle upgrade\", the laser is not wide enough for two cars parked at a reasonable distance (e.g. 3 feet). It took me a great deal of time to try different locations, different angles but the best I could do is for the laser to aim at the center of one car, and the passenger side of another. The problem is that there is a center console in the car so I would sometime miss the small dot if it lands at the side of the console.Second, we need to turn the car to part park our second car in the garage so the front of the car will not stay at the same place, and not quite in parallel with the front of the garage. This makes it difficult for us to judge the distance when the red dot lands at different locations each time. I suppose with time we should be able to learn the good stopping points though.I was not quite happy with the product so I bought a \"Camco AccuPark Vehicle Parking Aid\" and I realized that I was solving a simple problem with a complex solution since that simple piece of plastic works way better than the laser. The biggest difference is that you do not have to look for the laser dot and the car will stop by itself when it reaches the \"parking aid\", so whereas you could bump into something when you are not paying attention to the laser, you will definitely not bump into the wall as long as you are not accelerating in the garage.... There is really no need for a catching the red dot game each time when you park.",
