The only issue was with a smaller rake with a thin metal handle that would slide down. Also the racks come in 17\u201d lengths so if you have a wall with wider studs you may need to add some backing to hang them.",

Heavy tools like a big shovel or sledge hammer will sometimes pull themselves free and slide down. It's a novel idea and works well enough for what it is.If it were made a little more heavy duty I probably would have given it a 6. Still works well enough for the money.",

I wasn\u2019t sure how the hooks would work but they work very well. I hung a sledge hammer, brooms, rakes and other gardening tools. The grip on the hooks hold the tools in place nicely. Overall a great design. Be sure to screw them into a stud and they will stay in place. Really happy with the purchase. Things are much better organized.",

The price was good but I'm replacing with a heavier duty unit that will meet all my needs... not just a subset. The until comes in multiple 17\" sections which must be mounted individually. Perhaps flexible but more work to install. Comes with plastic anchors which require larger holes in sheet rock (16ea). This unit is NOT good for hanging larger items like hedge trimmers, leaf blowers, etc.",

Great that you can use it to latch rakes, shovels, or to hang tools directly on the hooks.

Hopefully, with some care we can make this last because it really makes my shed so tidy!",
