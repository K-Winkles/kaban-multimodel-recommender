                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Product",
                "reviewText": "I bought this hoist to store two kayaks (a Liquidlogic XP-9 and an XP-10) which are relatively short (9 and 10 feet, respectively) and wide (28 inches) in the living room of my apartment.Installation was extremely easy. Each system comes with two easy to install mounting plates on which the rest of the system is mounted. It takes two anchor points per plate, so I had to drill four holes per system on my concrete roof with a hammer drill and install sturdy anchors. As long as you measure correctly and align the holes properly, you will have a very nice looking system in place. I installed two hoists parallel to each other over my living room, one over the couch and the other over the coffee table. Then you mount the rest of the system on the plates and the entire process should take no longer than half an hour. Measure twice carefully (remember to consider a six inch clearance if mounting against a side wall) and drill once!After passing the lines through the pulleys there will be two lines, one for the back pulley and one for the front. I have had single rope systems which in theory should work, but in reality they do not because the friction on all the pulleys would have to be equal and it rarely is, which causes the load to tilt when raising or lowering. Yes, handling two independent ropes can be a little hard, but it is better than lowering a tilted 30 pound boat. Two lines guarantee horizontal lifting and, more importantly, a perfectly horizontal storing position.Lifting and lowering the kayaks is an easy operation. Once the webbing is tightly wrapped around the kayak you just pull the lines and it goes up. If you pull from behind the break it will go up with minor effort; once the kayak has reached its height you walk to the front of the break and it locks in place. Pass the lines through a cleat and that thing is not going anywhere.The cord that comes with the system is very low quality and it will have to be replaced as it frays easily with the friction from the break. I changed it for seven strand paracord (yes, it is a little expensive but well worth it) which is light, narrow, has a 500lb load capacity, works well with pulleys, and also looks good. This thing is in my living room and I like things to look nice. It looks very nice.If you mount this right, the kayaks will go as high up against the ceiling as you could possibly want. The tallest point in my kayaks is six inches from the ceiling, which means there is as much clearance as possible under the boats. I have standard height ceilings and it does not look crowded in there. The living room is perfectly usable and someone up to about 5'9\" will be able to stand under the boats.Excellent solution for an extremely low price. High quality materials except for the rope. Definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased two sets of hoists. We have 2 Hurricane Santee 12' kayaks, that have been stored at my brother's place for years. We wall-mounted them in his enormous garage. Ours is not as large and I value my wall space, so I went the hoist route. The kayaks weigh about 35 lbs each, so they are well within the weight limits of the hoist. I had entertained the possibility of constructing my own hoist using pulleys from the hardware store, but once you see this kit, you'll realized that $25 is not a lot to pay for the engineering and solid build of this product.Assembly:First, the instructions are not that bad. I had no problem visualizing the different options for mounting the hoists. The photos and diagrams were helpful. The joists of my garage are exposed and 9' off the floor. So I had hoped to raise the kayaks with enough clearance to walk under them without stooping. Mission accomplished. I am 71\" tall and the bottom of the kayaks were 76\" above the floor.You must decided whether to mount the hoist along the joists or perpendicular to them. I chose the perpendicular option, although it requires you to get an additional 2x4 for mounting the pulleys and some lag bolts and washers. This is all spelled out in the instructions. It took me a few hours to install each hoist. But I'm not a 'Mr Handyman'. Still, I had the tools and managed to do a pretty fine job, if I must say so myself.Once you install the mounts and pulleys, you must thread the rope between them. The diagram spells it out very clearly. The only area that might raise some questions is how to thread the ropes thru the locking mechanism. The diagram does show how to do it, but it might take a few tries to get it right. Make sure you know how to tie some good knots, because you need to tie two of them, and if they aren't secure, your kayak isn't either.Operation:I like the way the kayak raises. You pull two ropes together, and both ends of the kayak raise together, on the level. When you lower the kayak, you hold one of ropes and pull the other to release the lock. One end of the kayak lowers. Then you hold the other rope, pull the other, and the other end of the kayak lowers. This ensures that you lower the kayak slowly, and with control. Very clever. Like I said, it's worth $25 for this stuff.The rope quality has gotten a lot of mention in the reviews. I have not noticed significant fraying. It is not as bad quality as I was lead to believe. It is a lightly woven polyester or nylon rope. We'll see what it looks like in a few years.The one thing I do worry about is the quality of the plastic snaps on the straps that lift the kayak. If these snaps fail, look out! I played with one and thought is was fully snapped. It wasn't, and pulled apart with a little force. To me, this is the weakest link of the system.Also, the straps are adjustable so you can cinch them up and raise the kayak closer to the ceiling.It sure was nice to get the kayaks up in the air and out of the way. Now I have a lot more space in my garage to store some junk!",
