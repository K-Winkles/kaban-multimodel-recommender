                "reviewText": "These things are bright! They are nice and small, with adjustable \"fins\", allowing you to adjust the angle of the light. I have a two car garage, (with one large door for size reference). Previously I had two 75w bulbs in light sockets. These things are a lot brighter, but not so bright as to hurt your eyes if you look into them. The light they throw off covers about 85% of my garage extremely well, and the other 15% is pretty good (still better than the old incandescents). I can now look for tools in my tool chests and cabinets without the need for a flashlight. They are compact in size and screw in. Install took less than five minutes.Only negative is that they are so bright that from the curb of my driveway everyone can see into my garage and see what's in there with more clarity. Time will tell how long they last.",

The 5 light panels move easily but don't feel cheap and they stay in position where you put them making them very customizable for your space. The lights are very bright, I found one is enough to light up an entire two stall garage no problem. I ended up buying another pack for my basement and am very happy with my purchase. No complaints at all!",

And at least in my case, was much cheaper than replacing the old hardware and dead bulbs with new fluorescents.Keep in mind these screw into a standard light socket. I have included a pic that hints of how I went about this. Also, these are very bright, and not a soft white. Boy, do they really light up a space. They are also much brighter than the fluorescents they replaced. Very happy with my decision and choice.One pic is showing with the entry light off, the other with both lights on.",

                "reviewText": "We got these because we wanted BRIGHT in our cave-like garage that has high celings. It took a pole extension and a fancy light installation kit to get these in (we did pre-test the light bulbs before mounting them on a 15 ft ceiling, all good). We used a light bulb installation kit with 4 prongs, which took some jiggling to make work, but a kit with just the spring I don't think would have worked at all. It was able to install just fine, but removal may be more difficult, so hoping this lasts a while. I'll update if they don't.",
