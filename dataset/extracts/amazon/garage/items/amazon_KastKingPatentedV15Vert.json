            "STORE 15 RODS OR COMBOS \u2013 The KastKing V15 vertical fishing rod rack can store up to 15 rods or combos in less than 18 inches of horizontal wall space. Most other brands only store 6 combos in the same amount of space. Rods and combos can be mounted virtually anywhere along the length of the rod, permitting reels to be staggered at different heights for minimum storage space.",
            "INNOVATIVE DESIGN \u2013 This innovative fishing pole rack is simple and easy to use. Simply push the rod firmly into either the large or small v-grooves until the polymer grip material grabs the rod. For additional stability, hang the rod with the thread wrapped line guides just above the v-groove. The tapered v-grooves can accommodate up to a \u00bd\u201d diameter rod with a reel attached. To remove your combo from the fishing rod rack simply grab the rod near the rod rack and pull straight out.",
            "DURABLE MATERIAL \u2013 The KastKing V15 fishing rod holder is molded with tough amorphous polymer material which is resistant to heat, chemicals, and impact. The v-grooves are co-injected with a tacky thermoplastic polymer material to ensure rods and combos are held securely in your rack and doesn\u2019t damage or mar your rods.",
            "SIMPLE INSTALLATION \u2013 KastKing V15 fishing pole racks have 3 mounting holes. 2 outside holes are 16\u201d on center for secure installation on standard-spaced wall studs. To install the rack, determine the correct mounting height for your poles, install one of the outer screws into a stud, level the rack and mark mounting holes, install anchor for center mounting hole, re-level rod rack, install and tighten all screws. The KastKing V15 fishing rod rack will organize your fishing gear and save space."

The V15 fishing rod rack is made with durable non-rusting amorphous polymer material, which is chemical and heat resistant. KastKing co-injects a tacky thermoplastic polymer material into the v-grooves which holds your fishing rods securely place and will not damage the finish. This unique patented design (U.S. Patent No.7,237,685) fishing pole holder allows you to store as many as 15 rods or combos in a very small amount of space, less than 18 inches. The key feature is the tacky polymer v-grooves which can grab and hold any size rod up to 1/2\u201d in diameter. This allows you to stagger the height of the reels in the fishing pole rack thus reducing the amount of wall space used to store rods and combos. Most other brand rod racks only store 6 combos in the same amount of space.",

                "reviewText": "Had to give this product a full 5-stars all the way across even though I had to return due to it not working for my purposes. Inexpensive, sturdy, easy to install, innovative, space-saving and best of all- it actually held the rods very securely. I live in San Francisco with constant possibility of earthquakes, so holding power was first and foremost in my mind. To test I put a rod in the holder and shook it vertically, horizontally, and all over the place. It didn't even budge from its position. I wasnt able to test long-term vibration forces but overall i am very, very impressed with the holding power.Unfortunately, the V-shape isn't wide enough to hold my surf rods (main reason I tried it) so I had to return and purchase the orange/black KastKing vertical rack. If you install the V15 higher up on the wall and hang a thicker rod from further up it might work, but i have a low ceiling. My surf rods are St Croix Mojo Surf with a 70/30 split so the butt section has no thinner point to use. If I get into more lake fishing or similar and buy more rods, you can bet I will buy this V15 style again!Pros-Securely holds rods, will most likely hold up in earthquakesEasy to installGreat quality materials, high-impact plasticSaves a TON of wall and floor spaceCons-Won't fit thicker rods very well",
