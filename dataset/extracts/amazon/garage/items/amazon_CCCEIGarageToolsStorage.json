                "reviewText": "This rack organizes all of my power tools and makes it easier to have all of my rechargeable batteries charged and or charging at the same time. Before this I was always switching out batteries and chargers with the two outlets near my tool bench, which worked, but I would always forget to go back after one was charged and plug in another one. Now I have this rack up, all the power tools hang from the sides and all the charging stations sit on the shelves and are each plugged into the power strip that comes with the rack, just needs to be assembled when you get it. This rack has made the biggest difference of all my garage organization efforts, love it.",

                "reviewText": "I got this to help clean up my workbench/garage chaos and it did just that. I have multiple drills, chargers, bits, etc, you name it and they were all in different spots. I love that you can wall mount this, which frees up bench or shelving space right off the batt. The 8 outlet power strip means you can have everything in one spot, near one outlet without wire spaghetti all over the place. I placed everything where I wanted it and used zip ties to consolidate the wire mess.The unit itself was easy to put together. Couldn't have taken more than 20 min. Simple picture instructions were included. If you tighten the first few screws really well, you will likely have to loosen them to fit the shelf when it comes time. It's a tight fit, but that's not a bad thing.For drills and chargers, the strength/durability is adequate. I don't think it would hold up to any real weight, but that's not what it's meant for. The metal looks like it is powder coated, I don't think it will scratch easily. Hopefully, I will get some milage out of this.My only complaint is the dinky mounting hardware included, but that's true of most shelves, etc these days. Do yourself a favor and mount over a stud or have better mounting hardware available. The little allen key and baby wrench are also funny, but I guess if you don't have the grown up size on hand, they're a good addition.The 2 side racks for screw drivers and the like are also a little silly in my opinion. They kind of clutter things up. Tools would have to be on the shorter side to make it work. If you only have a couple screw drivers or pliers it's probably fine, but for anyone with any real variety, just skip in and use a tool box or drawer.The shelves are nice to have. Again, not for any real weight, but if you want to keep a bit case or two there, it's a nice feature.For the average homeowner, this is definitely adequate.",
