Thick and in very good quality. It is very easy to attach together. I am the only one installing this with no help and it took me about 2 hours, with no experience whatsoever. I just followed the manual that comes with it. I still have a lot of extra LED light in the box after I used up the hexagons for my design. I love how it lit up my garage. It is super bright even if I didn\u2019t use all of it. The hexagons are the right size for my design. I get a lot of great comments from friends, neighbors, and families when they see my garage. I would definitely recommend this.",

                "reviewText": "Had just moved in with my Fianc\u00e9 and she gave me free rein in the garage. Lights needed upgrading. Always thought the \u2018Hex Lights\u2019 were an overhyped trend but after calculating out quality shop lights and price per lumen, I decided to try these out. Also didn\u2019t want to deal with the attic running Romex and installing tons of Light Fixtures. These being plug and play made it easy!Long story short, these things are quality! Easy to install overall! Super bright! Lite enough to use drywall screws! They legit thought of the details with these. The recessed plug ins, the solid snap you feel when they are connected properly, the rigidity of each light and connector. Plus they give you at least 1 extra light just in case (I got 1 extra with the first pack and 2 with the other), plus extra connectors for multiple designs!With installation, I made sure to measure since I knew these would be a show piece. Once you install the first Hex, the rest are easy. Again, they are super lite, enough that I just used quality drywall screws (not the included anchor screws) and made sure not to strip them. Trust me, they are solid! I also left the protective film on each lite and pulled the ends back enough to plug the connector in, then I folded the film over the connector for that extra hold. But, they snap in very well, enough that while I had 2 sides of a hex screwed up, I plugged in the other 4 sides as a whole and they held up enough while I reached for the screw gun. I also bought a Light Socket Adapter that gave me 2 plugs so that they\u2019d work with the lite switch without having to rewire anything!Overall, well worth the money. I\u2019d by more just for additional design appeal, but these things are bright enough as it is!",

They are so bright I have two 6 foot led bars in the ceiling that are 10000 lumens each. After installing the hex lights I can\u2019t even notice the light bars. They make even my cluttered garage look pretty. I have 3 sets to give me that full range across the ceiling and it comes with everything you need to keep linking more together. Customer service is very helpful and replies quickly over email. Installing all 3 sets took only an hour or 2 it\u2019s really easy for a one person job. Once you get your first measurement in to make it all aligned they don\u2019t have much flex so you will stay on mark. When I went to expand later it was as easy as disconnecting the 2 way adding a 3 way and connecting more. I would highly recommend this to any car guy or wood workers.",

Only minor complaint is that the screws provided were cheap and stripped almost instantly. It didn't matter because I used strip ties to finish the install. Looks great and provides a bunch of light. I have shared the link and probably gotten three other people to buy this light in the two weeks that it has been installed.",

                "reviewText": "I always found my garage dark. Bought one of these and installed it. Man did it brighten everything up. This first one was a difficult install, because the ceiling was only rafters and I had to add crossbeams to secure it properly. Anyway after seeing how nice it brightened everything up, I bought two more (one for each of the remaining garage bays)These next two were really easy to install because I could anchor them into drywall (took a little over an hour each) and didn't have to add a bunch of crossbeam supports. Easily did this by myself these parts are incredibly light. I have the central garage bay direct wired into the ceiling lights, and the left and right wings connected to their garage door opener (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B24TX1QG?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) Very happy with the final outcome.One warning the design is expected to be mounted flush to the rafters or drywall (they provide simple anchors) directly. Because I had to work around the garage opener supports, I ended up getting 3 1/4 inch #8 screws and 2\" spacers to suspend this below the supports.So be aware of this when you order. Don't get one too big or you will encounter the same issue. I could have gone smaller, but in the winter I do a lot of projects and wanted the light.",
