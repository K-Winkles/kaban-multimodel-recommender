It heats up the entire room in about 8-10 minutes, very sleek looking and the app is great, the Alexa compatibility is a plus for me since I can ask her to prep the office room and it gets it to a nice warm temp. Very accurate temperature sensor and the mounting is very straightforward and even brings a mini level to make sure it\u2019s straight.Definitely recommend, looks amazing and functions amazingly.",

S set it for the temperature you want and it keeps it there. Easy Peezy. Open door or window feature is really handy. Wi-Fi set up with Alexa is the easiest of any device I\u2019ve ever used. Awesome design and on and on great little heater. Use it in a 500 square-foot Hospice room by the way. Very quiet at first and second speed. Reasonably white noise at speed H3. It don\u2019t look back..",

                "reviewText": "It's only been a week, but I have to say, I'm very impressed so far. I'll get the bad(or at least, the not great things) out of the wag first. The touch controls are a little off putting. I do appreciate the simplicity and minimalist look, but cramming that many functions into so few controls gets a little confusing. I'm also a not a big fan of the fact that Alexa won't let me group this with my nest thermostat to match the temperature in the house. And while that's more of a knock on Amazon and Alexa than it is dreo, it still needs to be noted.That said! I'm really into this thing. Our stairway to the second floor has no heat, and a GIANT old window. So it's very cold. On top of that, the two bedrooms up there are very big, and only have 1 vent each. So the cold stairway only makes it harder to hest those rooms. Ever since we added this to the stairway though, both the stairways and bedrooms have become noticeably warmer and more comfortable. The oscillating blower is perfect for what we need. I have it mounted over the stairs on the ledge and it's able to blow heat down the stairs and to the hall at the top at the same time.The app is great, and makes up for the clunky and complicated controls. Setting a schedule for the week to match the one we have for the house only took about 5 minutes. And while I am a little bummed about the grouping issue in Alexa, I'm very impressed by how much control over this Alexa DOES have. Most 3rd party devices have only very basic controls, this gives much more(though not as much as the dreo app does).Like I said, it's only been a week. But so far in beyond satisfied with the product. Absolutely recommend",

                "reviewText": "Ordered this Dreo wall heater through Amazon instead of their website (Dreo.com; Which if you order through Dreos website you can get 18% off which Amazon doesn\u2019t offer; as of today of this review). Works amazing for my 250 sq ft room. Was having problems with the internal dreo thermostat matching the ambient temperature, which you can calibrate it, and getting the unit to update. I reached out to customer support(Spoke to Tina and Jennifer through email; very wonderful and helpful) and not only did they give amazing support to help solve my problems, they sent a replacement dreo wall heater, and one of their Dreo air circulator fans for my troubles. Instead of them just throwing out random answers for support, they took the time to ask questions and verify your problems with pictures and videos if possible, so they can accurately give you the correct support needed, so their not wasting your time. I would recommend this wall heater to anyone. Able to set schedules, use your phone anywhere, any time to operate or adjust your heater. The heater doesn\u2019t use a lot of energy either, I check my electric app everyday and haven\u2019t noticed a huge increase in power consumption (KWH). In ECO mode, the unit will turn on and off once reaching set temperature to save you power. It\u2019s small but mighty! Super safe around kids and pets and way lower chances for a fire. Best heater purchase. Attached are pictures of the heater and the problem i was having with the thermostat. THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE IVE EVER EXPERIENCED WITH A COMPANY. I highly recommend this company to everyone for their products.",

                "reviewText": "We've purchased three of these, two for ourselves and a third for a family member because we liked them so much. We have a split level house, and despite central heat, the lower level is always quite a bit colder. Our main bedroom and my office/family room and on the lower level and it's always fairly chilly down there in the winter. We put one in each of the two large rooms downstairs, and they heat the rooms up quickly. The remote is great, but the app has many more programming options. The display lights are can be set to turn mostly off, it still puts out a little light but not enough to really bother us at night. They're much lighter than anticipated and easy to hang on the wall.",
