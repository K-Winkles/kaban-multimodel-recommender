TRULY not a huge deal, I should just be more careful with the leaf blower and rinse these out with a hose every now and then.",

When vacuuming it will lift the mat off of the floor on the ends be very careful, attempted to use a broom it will roll off the material in clumps like cotton drifting in the air. Keep garage doors closed any debris blowing in the air will find the mat. I had cut mine in half for two vehicles it looks nice on the floor and my vehicle have no oil leaks, knock on wood!!",
