The cord is durable and flexible, and it retracts smoothly and automatically with no kinks or tangles. The cord reel also has three outlets that can power multiple tools and devices at the same time. The circuit breaker switch protects the cord reel from overloading and short circuits, and the metal plate makes it sturdy and stable. The cord reel is easy to mount on the ceiling or wall, and it swivels 180 degrees for convenient access. I am very happy with this product and I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a reliable and versatile power source.",
