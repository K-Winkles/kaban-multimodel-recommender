                "reviewText": "I used 2 3\u201d toggle bolts (screws with anchors) for the install holes. Hung up my brooms, swiffer, dust pans etc getting things off the floor inside a standard coat closet in a laundry room. It arrived without damage, is durable and looks modern. Snug fit for each item too so nothing falls out of the grips. Ours was brushed nickel and gray tones. Great quality and a breeze to install.",

I wasn't sure if the vacuum was going to be too heavy for it but it has held it with no problems. There are some hooks that are handy for other lightweight things like rags, brushes, etc.",
