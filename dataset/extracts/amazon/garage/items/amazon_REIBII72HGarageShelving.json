                "reviewText": "I've got about 1000 Lego sets stored in my basement, I keep on buying new ones, and my shelving needs keep growing. I just redid the entire basement with some new shelving units similar to this, and while they work fine, and hold everything without issue, they were more cheaply made. I may have saved 5 or 10 bucks per 5 shelf set, and you could tell the difference trying to get the shelving suports in their little tabs.THESE, on the other hand, are MUCH easier to assemble. None of this tab into slot junk. Their assembly process is so much easier and quicker. I had one of these done in half the time the same sized other set took me, simply due to the ease of placing the supports and thumping them in place with my rubber mallet.I only needed one of these, and I had assembled it, not as a single 5 shelf unit, but two units, with 2 shelves and 3 shelves respectively, and came back upstairs to write my review, and saw they're on a 13% discount. I don't really NEED more right now, but I bought two more sets anyway while they were on sale, since I know at SOME point I'm going to want more shelves again. May as well get these while they're costing less.Definitely will be my go-to for inexpensive shelving moving forward.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these for indoor storage and eventually use in the garage. They are ok for indoor closet area and I like the solid shelf but I don't know that I'll use them in the garage. They are not as heavy duty as I anticipated. Putting them together is easy but the railings kept wanting to pop back out even after hitting them with the hammer. After getting it together it sways a little so I think if you want to use them in the lower configuration for heavier items they might be better but I am afraid of these suckers getting bumped in the wrong way and one of those railings coming back out. I almost wish they had some type of latch or bolt setup even though it's more to put together.",

It took me about 40 minutes during which time the cross bars came loose at the slightest movement. It is definitely better to have someone to hold pieces in place as you continue to add parts. Secondly the shelf boards are listed as heavy duty, extra thick. They are maybe 1/4 inch thick but probably more like 1/8 inch. I put it together 3 days ago and it is still sitting there empty because I am so disappointed.",

Made of high-quality metal frame+high-quality thicker MDF boards(Density 760kg/m\u00b3),so each shelf can hold up to 400 lbs, with a total bearing capacity of 2000 lbs, which makes 5-tier garage shelving unit more stable, solid and more stuff can be stored.\"The supplied MDF board are not \"thicker\" at all at a 1/4\" and too flexible. I do not think it will last 1-2 years without visible warping. There is no visible coating so if it gets wet, the board will deterioate quickly.The metal frame itself easily bends and twists! I would say it's probably 18-16 gauge metal. Overall, it well packaged but I would only target it for light use.",

First and foremost, these racks are junk, flimsy, and not durable....you get what you pay for here...Chinese pricing and clearly Chinese made... In addition, upon receiving the order and preparing for assembly I noticed one of the vertical metal pieces was missing (should have 8 total and I only received 7 - see picture). With that being said, I went to return the one rack, which was missing a vertical piece, and UPS wanted $72 for shipping the package back, based on size and total weight of box, I paid $75.75 for the item to begin with. Ultimately, with the cost to ship the incomplete item back, I decided to keep for spare parts (knowing the other complete one was cheap enough that it'll need to be replaced before it's a year old).",

The material seemed thin and flimsy, but against my better judgement I decided to assemble it. Once it was put together, it is actually quite strong, though not as strong as retail shelving, but still adequate enough for home use. I've got it fully loaded and on a level floor, it has no need for the wall attachments. I was surprised. I thought this was going to be a returned item, but I was wrong.",
