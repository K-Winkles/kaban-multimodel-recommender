Some of the wood was new pressure treated wood too so it was quite heavy.",

What I received from Ultrawall was two racks. That was half of my order. I contacted Ultrawall and they responded the same day. Ultrawall simply refunded my purchase and advised me to purchase more if I still needed the extra racks. This was quick and acceptable solution.The racks are of decent quality. They look like they will support the weight of the lumber I intend to store in them. Time will tell if the paint holds up to the abuse of lumber sliding on and off of the racks.",

                "reviewText": "I find that the room in between shelves is not a good enough amount for stacking the wood on. I was only able to use two of the bars for my garage because the distance between shelves was too small, so I could only use two of them for my wood. I now have a set of bars that need a bracket to fit it up on the wall. I\u2019m unable to use it without the wall bracket to mount it to. It\u2019s frustrating because I need to use the third shelf for my lumber and I can\u2019t do that without the wall mounting. Otherwise it is a great idea for storing the wood up off the floor. I\u2019m willing to pay for the mounting rack and if the seller is willing to send me a couple more and I suggest that they change it to a longer mounting rack for allowing more room for the wood than the six inch space that you would have to use or not use it, if you want to be able to put your hand on your wood to choose a board. 2 2x4\u2019s and a hand isn\u2019t much room. I\u2019m willing to pay for the extra two pieces if the seller is willing to sell me another set of mounting frames. You must use their frame to attach the shelves to it for them to attach. So make sure you understand what space you\u2019re going to have and what space you\u2019re going to need because the frame is only about 16-18\u201d tall so divide that by 3 and then you will have the dimensions for your own space and how much room you want to have for your wood to use.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this lumber rack to better organize my woodworking shop. There are pros and cons to this lumber rack. First the cons... doesn't have spacers to put between the wall and brackets causing the racking to mark up the wall, the hardware for mounting the brackets to the wall are insufficient, too short and I needed to go buy 12- 4\" hex bolts to secure to my wall property. Lastly, I was missing two bolts in my order and had to purchase two bolts to attach the lumber supports to the wall support. Pros- the value is fair as long as all the hardware is included, the quality of the product is good, and the powder coating is nice. Once I installed my own hardware to secure it to my wall, I can say I'm happy with it. Buyers just beware of the insufficient hardware included, I recommend you purchase better hardware.",
