                "reviewText": "I have a lot of things to hang in my house, that way I can be more organized, and these look like they'll do the trick for more than half of the things I need to take care of. There's a pair of smaller hooks, and just one of them works perfectly for my ironing board which used to have to sit on the floor. The size range of these hooks, plus the anchors that come with them mean you can hang a large variety of objects, from bicycles, to yard tools (weed eaters as example) and many other items. I do find that many of these have narrow spaces between the hooks but that's why they come in pairs, so they can be utilized to lay items across if necessary. The narrowness of some of the hooks is why I took down one star, I'd like a larger variety of hooks that have a wider space for items to fit into when hung up.",

Hubby was very adept at fixing nearly everything himself and building whatever we might need. We have a lot of miscellaneous tools that these brackets handle quite well. The large variety of shapes and sizes of the hooks and brackets lend themselves to versatile use. Every thing is easy to see, so there is no digging through cupboards, boxes or bins to find what is needed. The brackets are very easy to attach to studs or a wall.",

                "reviewText": "I like the look of these hooks. They look premium. I can't speak to how well the rubber coating will stand up over time, but they look great out of the box.As usual, the mounting hardware is useless. At the very least, the screws have the wrong type of head on them. I always use better quality hardware that I keep on hand for these sorts of things.The variety of hooks is a bit repetitive. You basically get two sizes of the one shape and three sizes of the other shape. They are not bad selections, but they are pretty basic. I didn't take any stars off for this, but I thought about it.(I've never used this style of broom hooks. I'm more than leery of them and doubt I'll end up hanging them on the wall.)",

                "reviewText": "I really like how this comes with a bunch of different hooks. It gives a lot of options of what you can hang, how you can hang it and where. Adds tons of flexibility. The hooks are sold when installed and comes with tons of screws and drywall anchors. Hooks seem good quality tooWill say that having a variety of hooks leaves a couple unused and not sure where Im going to put them. But am not going to take it against the product as in the future I may install them when need arise",
