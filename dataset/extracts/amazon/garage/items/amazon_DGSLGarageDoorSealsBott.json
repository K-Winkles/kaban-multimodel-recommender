Whatever you use your garage for, you want to make sure it stays dry. Otherwise, what\u2019s the point? However, the last few times you\u2019ve been out there, you\u2019ve noticed that it\u2019s colder than usual. Or hotter. It also seems really dirty, even though you sweep it regularly. And, suddenly, it seems brighter in there than usual. That\u2019s why you need garage door weather stripping. Typically it is advisable to remove the existing retainer from the bottom of the garage door. In some instances it will be okay to install the new retainer over the existing retainer however, and it is imperative that the new retainer is mounted securely to the bottom of the garage door.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars I had none of the problems mentioned by other reviews. Well-made product and easy installation.",
                "reviewText": "Review date: August, 20, 2023 -Other reviews mentioned things such as this being a flimsy product and easy to rip or tear it even by hand, and about it being difficult to install. I found neither of those things to be true with the product I received. It was exactly as advertised and pictured. The rubber is heavy duty, supple, easy to work with, and feels durable for the long term. I tried to tear it by hand (as shown in one review with a video) and I couldn't begin to tear it. The quality seems plenty good to last for many years, even here in Wisconsin where we have temperatures as high as 100F above zero in the summer to as low as 35F below zero in the winter.Still other reviewers mentioned that it was difficult to install and that they had a lot of problems. I ordered a 20-foot piece of this product to use on a pair of 9-foot-wide garage doors. I pulled out the old door seals which had seen many, many better days and were in terrible shape, brittle, broken, flattened, missing big chunks, and being at least 25 years old, origin unknown. I then used a broom to sweep the dirt and cobwebs off the bottom of the doors that had been hidden under the old seals. Then, I lubed the T-slots that this product slides into, all the way across the door using a product I had on hand called Fluid Film spray (great, useful product in its own right and available here on Amazon).I was able to replace the seals on both doors in about 30 minutes by myself, including gathering materials before and cleanup after. With one hand, I formed the new seal into a cup-shape (it ships flat and rolled up) and fed it into the door seal mounting slots, and with the other hand I pushed it along the bottom of the door until it reached the other side. I did it all while standing in one spot at one end of the door, and did not utter one cuss word the whole time. Then I used a good shop scissors I have to cut off at the proper length. Easy-peasy! The process of feeding the new seal through the slots took less than five minutes per door.Because of some of the reviews that said installation could be a headache and took them a long, frustrating time, I almost didn't do it today because it was a bit hot outside and I didn't want to get into problems in the heat. But on the spur of the moment this morning I decided to do the installation and it went great. I couldn't have asked for better if I had designed the garage doors and the seal myself.If I notice any undue or early wear on this product that shouldn't be happening I will come back to update this review, but thus far I'm very happy with the product, the installation and how much better the new seals look from both inside and outside of the garage. Much less light comes through compared to the old, worn-out seals, which means more of old man winter will stay outside where he belongs, and we heat our garage to about 60F in the winter, so that is a good thing.TL/DR : Great product. Heavy-duty, easy to work with, easy install went great, and I'm a happy customer.",

                "reviewText": "Ok I bought this to replace my garage door seal that had been chewed through by rats or mice. I\u2019ve been paying an official garage door guy $100 to replace this once every two years on average. Guy always claims it\u2019s tough to do. I never paid attention since he\u2019s the \u201cpro\u201d what could I do. Well the mouse chewed through another gasket so it was time for a replacement. I checked this replacement and read the reviews. It said high quality fit great etc. reviews said if you want this to go smooth and easy get a second person to feed the gasket into the track as the other person slowly pulls it. I got my son to help me. Reviews also said clean out the track first so it slides easier. I got a can of garage door spray and cleaned the tracks then sprayed them to make sliding this gasket a little easier. It all worked perfectly! The gasket is high quality, better than what I had and all the prep work made it an easy install. It was slightly longer than my door so I trimmed maybe an inch and it\u2019s perfect. Last thing I did was adjust my garage door travel so my door didn\u2019t squish this new taller gasket. I just looked my model up on the internet and there are a ton of videos how to do this. I was done in maybe a minute. I\u2019ve been paying a dude $100 a pop to do what we just did for barely nothing. You can do it too. Just get things ready go slow and get an assistant. My sons total time helping me once I got all the pre work steps done was maybe 4 minutes tops. This gasket is sturdy, well made, thicker than original, and a little longer which is great for me. I\u2019m pumped and couldn\u2019t be happier!",

This seems to have enough flex to seal our slightly uneven surface and provide a good seal. The 20ft length easily spanned the 2 8ft doors we have. Easy to trim. 4 stars only due to no information on durability over time.",

                "reviewText": "I can agree with several reviewer comments. This a two-person job. You should roll the stripping out leaving it in the sun for several minutes before attempting to install. Also, a utility knife works well removing existing weather stripping. WD40 does ease the installation but don't use too much as it makes the rubber overly pliable and slips out of the door bottom channel. I had to make several passes to remove the excess WD40 because the back edge kept popping out. Eventually, I got it to stay in place with the help of a flat-head screwdriver and carefully reinserting into the channel. Just over an hour later everything was complete. BTW, I did check and WD40 does not harm the rubber. This weather stripping is superior to the original which was a somewhat too stiff / hardened and failed to completely seal my garage door. I gave 5 stars because it works so well, albeit being a bit difficult to install (maybe my fault for using too much WD40).",

The old seal slides out easily because its old and stiff, but the new seal is soft and rubbery so it doesn't slide in so easy. I would recommend taking the time to clean and lubericate the tracks after you remove the old seal. Give the new seal time to conform to the shape of the floor as it will have gaps if the floor isn't even.",
