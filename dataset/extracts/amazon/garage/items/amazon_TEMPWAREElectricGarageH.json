I first hooked up the ground wire thinking it would be addaqit but the heater did not put out a lot of heat\ud83d\ude14. I thought about it and hooked up the black and red to L1 and L2 and the neutral (white) to the ground lug. WOW, it works awesome! I installed it at 1 end of a 20X60 room that is insulated with spray foam. I can play pool in a t shirt. Worth every penny. In the second picture of the length of the room I took the picture from about 45' away from the heater, I can hear it but it sounds like a box fan running. Great heater!!!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Mighty little heater! Didnt work out well with our 13ft ceilings",
                "reviewText": "FIRST IMPRESSIONThe unit seems fairly well constructed although the sticker on the front with all the buttons/labels was half peeling off but easily stuck on again. The unit it shockingly light and small for what I expected a 220V 7,500 watt heater to be. The terminals on the connection block don't feel extremely sturdy although they did the job. One of the heating element grates were bent but didn't seem to affect safety/functionality. We connected a 50 amp range cord to the unit that would connect to the NEMA14-50 outlet we had installed by our home builder for this very purpose. As recommended, we popped in a 40 amp breaker and flipped the switch. Worked great.CONDITIONSBecause a heater's performance can be dramatically affected by the environment, I'll spell out the conditions in our garage. We mounted it in a 13ft tall, 26x26 partially (attached to home) insulated garage that has a doorway left open to a standard 9ft 22x22 partially insulated garage. The primary garage to heat is 676sqft and the other garage is 484sqft for a total of 1160sqft of garage. The unit is mounted roughly 9ft off the ground in the 13ft garage. Ambient temps outside are 37 degrees today and we ran the unit on high for 2 hours. By the 1 hour mark it had taken the garage from 41 degrees to 50. By the end of hour 2, it was only 55. (Please note - the temperature was taken on the opposite side of the garage, roughly 5ft off the ground) The thermostat on the heater never read above 67, which tells us it was struggling with the size of the garage.When standing on a ladder, it became immediately obvious that all the heat was sitting about 7 to 8 feet off the ground, and a ceiling fan in the garage would do wonders for pushing that heat down. Still, I'm questioning if this unit will be enough with an uninsulated garage this size. I'm sure that insulating it would definitely make a difference but I'm not out in the garage enough to need that. I just want to keep the garage at 45 to keep everything from freezing and simply need some heat blasting in the half hour I'm doing any projects outside. I'm not a fan of turning on a heater for 2 hours before i'm gonna be out there to get into the mid 50s, plus in Ohio, high 30s outside is pretty warm for winter. Usually we're close to single digits to teens this time of year, and that has me much more concerned how this would perform under those colder conditions.FUNCTIONALITYThe very best part about electric heaters is that you immediately get very hot heat. Within 15 seconds it was blowing nearly 200 degrees. 2 minutes later it was in the high 300s. This heater makes quick work of spitting out that heat.It has 4 modes, Fan only, Low, High and Eco. It might be a stretch calling Eco a mode as it more or less switches between the other 3 modes depending on the conditions in the room. I found it a little useless personally, so I stuck to low and high. Fan mode does just that, blows only the fan without any heat, Low mode turns on most of the heating elements and high turns them all on. As I'll explain down in the cost section, low mode only uses 15% less energy than high, so it might simply leave one of the heating elements off. I found that pointless as it barely saves any money but somehow feels like it's putting out A LOT less heat. I would have preferred a low mode that were closer to half the cost to run. To no surprise, High worked best of all, but of course costs the most to run.Of note, the fan does NOT change speeds on any of the modes, it just uses less/more heating elements which make up for the cost difference. If I'm being picky, I feel like it's a little on the weak side. Would have been nice to have seen a little more oomph to push all that heat farther out in the room.When turning off, the unit, it will run for 90 more seconds to cool off the elements enough to shut down. It even counts this 90 seconds down on the temp display, which I thought was a pretty cool touch. Most manufacturers do NOT recommend cutting power to heaters immediately (via an external power cut-off) except for emergencies for this reason, as cooling the elements off both affects longevity as well as safety of red hot elements.The remote is simple and not confusing at all to useEFFICIENCY/RUNNING COSTEveryone keeps asking how much this unit costs to run so I've decided to post some cold-hard, no BS numbers captured with our energy monitoring software we use. Your own cost to run may vary wildly depending on your electricity rate, but I've included pictures of the wattage/cost for all 3 modes. These are based off our electric rate of $0.16 per kW. Fan only mode draws 38 watts and barely costs $0.01/hr. Low runs about 6,350 watts and costs roughly $0.92/hr. Lastly, High will pull the full 7,500 watts and will be around $1.09/hr. Low mode only draws about 15% less energy than high, so I found the savings to be moot when the heat put out feels like about half. In the 2 hours we ran it, the cost averaged out to about $0.15 per degree raised from 41 degrees. That number can grown very quickly as you get below freezing and into the single digits/zero.SUMMARYI was very happy with the performance of this heater, although I've spelled out quite a few reasons why it isn't what I was hoping for in our situation. We're presented with a couple of options to solve our issue with this unit under-producing for our needs (A) We can either buy a ceiling fan for the garage that will push a lot of that hot air down making it much more efficient and likely much closer to the size we need, (B) We could insulate the garage (which would be substantial cost) or lastly (C) we can just try the 10,000 watt unit, which will run roughly $0.38 (or 25% more) per hour more. Given that Amazon gives your free returns for 30 days, we will likely try the 10,000 watt model and compare their performance, then return whichever we don't feel like keeping.Granted we only used this heater for one day, but my initial impression is 5 stars for anyone with a smaller garage/workshop with lower ceilings and/or insulated walls. If you've gotta overcome 1 or both of those issues, you may need a bigger unit or a ceiling fan to make it work for you.",

Based on internet research, a 5,000 watt heater would do for my space but and I was concerned about the high ceiling (12 ft)-- so I went to the 7,500 watt.This heater has mixed reviews, but I have not had one minute of trouble. I got it when the weather was much nicer so I waited until I could give it a real test. I'm in the south so I know we can't do a \"real\" test but today I am at a 35 degree temperature differential and it took about 20 minutes to get here. The heater cycles on and off about every 10 minutes.I put a fan under the heater to blow room temperature air on it to keep the entire shop around the same temperature. It is about 9 feet above the floor.I also got it on sale on Black Friday for about $140 so this was totally a no brainer for me.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars It's a 10,000 watt resistor",
                "reviewText": "Pro: Cheap, light weight (relatively), simple to install and operate.Con: The fan is fairly noisy, the thermostat does not work (not as big a deal as it might sound because the thermostat can only measure the heater's internal temperature, not the temperature of the room). Also, its hard for a single person to lift it up into its arms and bolt it on.All room heaters are the same. They are resistors. They are 100% efficient at converting current to heat and therefore they all cost the same to run (per unit of heat generated). I got the 10 kw model. At off-peak we pay about 6 cents per kilowatt hour so this heater costs 60 cents per hour to operate. During peak rate, the cost more than doubles to about 15 cents per kwh and so then it costs about $1.50 per hour to run the heater. If you translate this into 10 hours per day, the heater burns between $180 and $450 per month to operate.This is why electric resistive heat is rarely used for whole-house heating. But, for a workshop like mine that I might use 10 hours per week, the heater is ideal. Just be sure to have a second fan to mix the air in your space or all the hot air will just hug the ceiling while you freeze below.",

Overall, it\u2019s a nice little heater and seems to be working as designed in my 900sq ft garage with 9ft ceiling. I bought the 7500w because it said it was rated up to 1250 sq ft. It takes about an hour+ to heat up the space by 30 degrees on low (from 40 to a comfy 70 degrees). Might be quicker if I added a ceiling fan to circulate the air better.The first unit I had, the fan rattled on startup. When I pointed it down on the last set of holes it would rattle constantly. The seller provided instructions to tighten up the fan and brackets but that didn\u2019t fix it. They eventually sent me a replacement which works great! No rattle and it runs pretty quiet too. Seller was very helpful and it shows that they care. I would definitely do business with them again.",
