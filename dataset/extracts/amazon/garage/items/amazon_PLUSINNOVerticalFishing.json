Just hope it keeps the grip strength over time (fingers crossed) but so far it seems like a good quality product at a reasonable price point.",

I have never had any of them fall off. It was simple enough to mount. You basically have two options. First you can mount the rack on studs. Or you can use heavy duty wall anchors. Mounting on studs is a bit more time consuming but much more secure. I went with the stud option when I mounted mine. You can use a level to make sure that it is straight. I just eyeballed it and it worked fine for me though.You will have to stagger your rods to make the most of the racks space and get as many rods on there as you can. That was no big deal. This is a nice rod hanger and I really like its color and how secure it holds the rods. They are in there tight.",

I don\u2019t know the first thing about fishing so asked our friend to help me sort and organize (and thin out) all the fishing stuff at our family cottage. These fishing-rod holders helped us tidy and more safely store the fishing rods in a logical way. Honestly I learned so much about reels etc. and love how much all these lovely rods now look all lined up and wiped off that now I\u2019m a little bit interested in getting some fresh line and trying a little bit of catch and release fishing of some little bass next year. What a wonderful high-quality product.These rod holders grasp everything from the lightest rods to super-heavy lines with giant reels loaded with weighty steel lines.",
