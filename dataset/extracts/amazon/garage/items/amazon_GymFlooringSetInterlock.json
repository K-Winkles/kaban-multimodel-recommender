It offers good cushion and support for my feet and back, while protecting the wood floors underneath. If I have a spill, I\u2019ve been able to clean it up easily, depending on the product.I haven\u2019t had a totally liquid spill yet, to see if it seeps between the seams. However, because it\u2019s in pieces I can always pull up the effected tiles and dry it out underneath, I\u2019m sure.I didn\u2019t create the exact dimensions that it\u2019s sold as. I created a smaller area for my largest section and created a small covering to fit next to it, under my desk. There\u2019s a small link in the corner that doesn\u2019t quite make a seamless square, when it\u2019s only one tile deep, but it\u2019s not noticeable under the desk chair.I\u2019m very happy I purchased this particular product. I searched through every type and review and like the thickness and versatility of this one. Plus, overall the price was great. I also liked that it came in light grey, which matched the bedding and decor in the rest of the room.",

I have hard tile over concrete in a rented apartment. I mistakenly thought this would be better than buying new anti fatigue mats. If you are looking for something to soften the floor, this isn\u2019t it. Make sure you pay attention the amount and dimensions too, they are very small, same size as the small kids ones. It covers under a 5ft by 3ft area, that\u2019s it. So a very small strip.",

The pattern is great. So far they are lasting well. My son has started to pull some up and bite them and they don\u2019t break. The thickness is good also (not too thin). They also come with plenty extra side pieces so that you can make different designs and seal up the serrated edges! Highly recommend!",
