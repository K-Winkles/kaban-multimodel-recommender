                "reviewText": "This drive is great once you get your cloning done, and that's the rub. Th package shows a link to download Acronis True Image HD but that product has been discontinued. I was directed to another Acronis product to download but it then could not use the supplied activation key, because it was the wrong software. Somehow I managed to get the correct software, Acronis True Image OEM and activate it. The super slow cloning produced a non booting image three times before I was able to find software that actually was free and worked (Disk Genius). Once my boot drive was successfully cloned, the computer booted in record time. Nice and fast, exactly twice as fast as my previous sata SSD.",

                "reviewText": "The hardest part was finding tiny screws, not Kingston's fault. Each motherboard may be different. I bought it to copy everything from a 1TB drive (not the boot drive), because it was about 75% full. It was so fast copying I couldn't believe it. I checked to see if the drives matched. But the new drive looked like it was missing 400MB. It took me a while to find out and why I couldn't switch the drive letters. I used part of the older drive as virtual memory and the boot drive, and that's where the extra used space was. I turned off the virtual memory and now the sizes match, and only about 48MB was being used. I wouldn't have bought it if I remembered I had virtual memory on it. I had to use a program I bought to transfer the stuff to the newer SSD M.2, which is fast and works great.",
