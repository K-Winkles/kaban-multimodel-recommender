So there's only two things that matter: Speed & longevity. There are hundreds of SSD brands out there, but most I wouldn't trust my temp files to, least of all my pictures, game files, music & more.

                "reviewText": "I use laptops/notebooks pretty much exclusively since around 2008. Never had SSD temperature issues before, but my MSI GT77 Titan was cooking my SSDs, so I went looking for the coolest SSD I could find. The WD Black SN850X had incredible performance for the price, but it would get over 70\u00b0 C and be disconnected in the middle of large transfers. The factory Samsung 980 Pro already has bad blocks, and it had only been half a year before they started showing up. Pretty much every SSD I tried would idle around 45\u00b0 C and get up to at least 60\u00b0 C while gaming (no load on the SSDs, just temps inside the laptop). I assumed that the Crucial P3 Plus would have better temps since it's a slower drive, but it was actually one of the worst of the bunch in terms of temperatures (it's an incredibly good deal for the money aside from the temps though). The Sabrent Rocket Q4 has decent temps, a bit above the 980 Pro. The SK Hynix P31 and P41 have temps that are at least as good as the 980 Pro, and while they use very little power, they still weren't the coolest.I even purchased a second laptop with - I kid you not - a liquid cooling loop. This definitely helped the overall temps, and the Tongfang bottom plate helped because it's metal and not plastic like the MSI (so the bottom plate is like a big heatsink). Still, SSDs could hit 60\u00b0C.I lucked out only when someone on the XMG Discord server mentioned how cool the older Firecuda 520 and 510 were for them.I am completely blown away with how low the temps are while the performance is excellent. The performance is not quite as good as the SN850X, but this is comparing a drag racer with a formula 1 car; they are both so much faster than anyone realistically will ever need, so the speed differences don't really matter at all in real life. Far more important is the fact that the Seagate runs about 20\u00b0 cooler than the WD... Yes, it's seriously that much.The Firecuda tends to idle in the 30 to 40 range, and I've only seen it hit 60 or even the upper 50s when under extreme load. When I say extreme, I mean something like installing about a terabyte of Native Instruments software in a single go, nonstop reads and writes.You definitely pay a premium for the cool temps as well as the performance and brand name, but when you're talking about potentially destroying several terabytes of data with hotter SSDs, it's worth every penny.Right now I am only running Firecuda 530s in every M.2 slot, and the temps are both consistent and cool. Everything else is in an external enclosure that acts like a big heat sink as well. I never would have gotten my issues resolved without switching to this specific SSD.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect match for the PS5",
                "reviewText": "After researching various PCIe Gen4 SSDs for the PS5 (and discovering this drive had the most votes for \"best performance\" across multiple review/analysis sites) I decided to give it a shot, making sure to get the one with the included heatsink (important!) I was not disappointed, like WOW...For full disclosure, I purchased the 2TB SSD with the included heatsink.# Easy to install:Sony gets points for this category as well for making it so simple to open and add/upgrade the SSD inside the PS5. We simply slid off the white cover, removed the SSD expansion door/shield, and used the already included (with the PS5) hardware to fasten the SSD into the slot. The dimensions of the SSD (including the heatsink it comes with) are a perfect match for the SSD expansion slot on the PS5. It fits like a glove (see pictures). Then it was simply a matter of closing the expansion slot, replacing the cover, and booting up the PS5!# Setup:As soon as the PS5 booted up, it recognized the new SSD and gave me the option to \"format\" it (required to set it up to recognize the PS5's file system). The formatting process took about 20 seconds and then it was done! It was ready to use. You must make sure you go into the PS5's 'Storage' settings to make sure you designate your new drive as the installation location for new games, or specific content (if you want to use it that way, of course). Or you can simply transfer files to and from the SSD expansion at your leisure.# Performance:While this drive claims read speeds of around 7,300MB/s your mileage may vary on the PS5. The PS5 reported around 5,700MBs - but keep in mind this is not a limitation of the SSD but the data transfer subsystem of the PS5 itself. Rest assured, it's most likely the drive is capable of up 7,300MB/s on compatible hardware, and you can sleep easy knowing that its bandwidth capabilities are well in excess of what the PS5 needs to run at peak performance.I ran a test by copying Uncharted 4: A Thief's End (57GB of data) from the PS5 local storage to the new SSD. It took around ONE MINUTE to transfer! That's insane.I then installed the new Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection to this storage and benchmarked the performance/load times of the game, and they were on par with the PS5's local storage, loading up an entire level in just under 2 seconds!I've read that high performance SSDs like this one can even perform a little faster than the on-board SSD that came with the PS5, but, the performance of either drive (internal or expansion) is so fast already, the differences will be too subtle to notice. Especially on PS5 optimized games that load faster than the time it probably takes to start your stopwatch and benchmark.# Final ThoughtsThis SSD (with the included heatsink) is clearly designed with PS5 expansion in mind. If that is why you're looking at this SSD then I can strongly recommend it. It's easy to install, fits like a glove, and performs well in excess of what the PS5 requires. It has been going strong in my PS5 for 6 weeks now and I am extremely happy with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Works perfect. No delays what's soever. easy install really simple just 5 screws but you might be tempted to keep going deeper into the ps5 because of how much dust can accumulate inside, def use this time to quickly vacuum up or use air to blow dust out of your system. At least for me it was crazy how much dust was there. But really happy with the prpduct finally can have all my games for my ps5 ready to play when I choose which was really frustrating having a digital version . Only problem is I only got a 2 tb and it's almost full already should of got 4 or 8 so keep in mind how many games you plan on having.",

Despu\u00e9s solo reemplace el disco en la Rog Ally, y al encender estaba mi sistema operativo y todos los juegos tal cual como en el disco anterior, pero ahora con mucho espacio libre adicional para continuar instalando m\u00e1s juegos.En resumen estoy totalmente satisfecho con la compra, sin complicaciones ni necesidad de buscar software de terceros.",
