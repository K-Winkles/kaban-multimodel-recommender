                "reviewText": "A good SSD for external storage, if you put it in a drive case. Seems fast enough, but I haven't tested it for speed. It worked right away and has not failed in several months of occasional use. I wouldn't expect it to fail, but new brands don't have a track record yet. I did not comparison shop, however I remember the price of name brands to be only about 20% more than this drive, so if you want to save some money with an SSD that is not for a critical use, give this a try.",

All i had to do was plug it in, format it and it was ready to go. it maintained a 580 MB/s write speed while downloading a 300gb game. for this price, it's a fantastic SSD. i will definitely come back to buy RAOYI SSDs again. great product, great price, great performance.",
