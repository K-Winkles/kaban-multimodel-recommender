                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Speed - This is a fast hard drive",
                "reviewText": "I bought this drive for my ~9 year old laptop which still is fast and reliable because I was concerned about the existing hard drive wearing out and having a problem. I decided to go with a mechanical hard drive rather than an SSD (Solid State Drive) because the mechanical hard drives last longer. I wanted as fast a drive as I could get which means that I wanted a 7200 RPM drive (RPM = spin rate and most hard drives are 5400) and a SATA 6 (data transfer rate). Amazon delivered the drive last night and this AM I swapped out my old hard drive and loaded my backup image that I made last night and everything worked out perfectly.I just found out that some Amazon products including this drive offer chat technical support (it appears to be free). On your order page which shows the order detail you will see a button to the right labelled GET HELP.If you are buying a new drive to replace your C drive which would be the case if your current C drive failed or if you need a larger capacity drive, you will need to have the ability to install Windows, the apps you installed on your current drive and your data on the new drive. Some PCs came with Windows recovery DVDs but most PCs require that you run a utility to create the recovery media. A couple of quick points;1) Create your disc image or recovery media on a USB rather than a DVD.2) Be sure to USB 3.0 flash drives rather than the slightly cheaper USB 2.0 flash drives. Disc images are large and the USB 3.0 standard is about 10 times faster than a USB 2.0. It would typically take about a minimum of 2 hours to create an image of a Win 10 system with your apps & files using a USB 3 flash drive or about 20 hours with a USB 2. USB 3, 3.1 and 3.2 are about the same speed.3) When creating your image, look at the options in the utility you are using and select any options that have the word 'legacy' support. If you have an older PC, you will need it and if you have a newer PC it won't hurt.4) Since my old drive was working, I used some free software from Macrium Software to create the image. At least I thought it was free and it was free to create the image but I must have missed some fine print that you have to buy a $70 license to restore the image made for free. I could have manually reinstalled all of the apps I had added (Thunderbird, Firefox, etc.) and my personal file backups and customize the system which would have taken 5 or 6 hours.Some of the terminology used by utilities that create disc backups is confusing. A clone is an exact disc to disc copy of the entire drive. To clone a drive, you need a 2nd hard drive (mechanical or SSD) installed in the PC or on the network. An image (vs a clone) is an exact copy of the entire disc written to another hard disc or a flash drive but not in a bootable format. An image copy is an intermediate format somewhat in the same sense that a ZIP file is an intermediate format.As an FYI, it is very easy to remove and replace a laptop from most if not all laptops made in the last 10 years or so. However, you will need a very small Philips head screw driver to physically make the change. Don't try using a larger screw drive and pushing hard as is you strip the slot you are screwed.As an FYI, the image of my Window 10 system with about 6g of personal files used 34g on my flash drive.12/12/2022 : Correction (possibly) - My comment about there being a charge to use Macrium Reflect to restore an image might be incorrect. There is an cost to \"redeploy\" an image but apparently not to \"restore\" an image. Redeploy is what would be required to restore an image to a different system or different hardware. I don't think that restoring an image to a different hard drive in the same system would be a redeploy so probably would be no charge. You could try doing the restore without paying a license charge and then only paying if required.",
