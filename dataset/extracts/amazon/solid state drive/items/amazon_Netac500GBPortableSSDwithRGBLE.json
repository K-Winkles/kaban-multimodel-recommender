It\u2019s been working perfect for that, and I really love the small, convenient size of it. It comes with a nice little leather (or fake leather -I\u2019m not sure) case that seems pretty protective. I actually use the case to cover the hardrive up with Lee using it when I don\u2019t want to be distracted by the flashing lights. It works for that, too. My teenage son, who is a gamer, ly likes the look of it and wants one for himself. It would fit right in with his keyboard with colored backlighting and other various computer parts and accessories with colored chasing lights.",

However, I most likely will not be using the leather case because it defeats the rgb lighting which is the sole purpose to purchasing this product. The speed of transferring/managing files to & from will more than just suffice due to the type c connectivity. If it weren't for the rgb lighting, this would be as basic as it gets to accomplishing storage tasks. Nonetheless, I'd recommend.",

My favorite thing about the product is the small form factor which makes it easy to carry every day in case I have some free time to back-up my machine.",
