        "description": "Incredible speeds plus rock-solid reliability - Kingston's A400 solid-state drive dramatically improves the responsiveness of your existing system with incredible boot, loading and file transfer times compared to mechanical hard drives. Powered by a latest gen controller for read and write speeds up to 500MB/s and 450MB/s, this SSD is 10x faster than a traditional hard drive for higher performance, ultra-responsive multi-tasking and an overall faster system. Also more reliable and durable than a hard drive, A400 is built with Flash memory. There are no moving parts, making it less likely to fail than a mechanical hard drive. It's also cooler and quieter, and its shock and vibration resistance makes it ideal for notebooks and other mobile computing devices. A400 is available in multiple capacities from 120GB-480GB to give you all the space you need for applications, videos, photos and other important documents. You can also replace your hard drive or a smaller SSD with a drive big enough to hold all your files. Backwards compatibility to SATA Rev. 2.0 (3Gb/s) Product contains drive only; cloning software not included. The Vibration operating of this product is 2.17G Peak (7\u2013800Hz) and the Vibration non-operating of this product is 20G Peak (10\u20132000Hz).",

                "reviewText": "PRODUCT: Kingston A400 120GB SSDSUMMARY:This drive is a great deal for improved performance if you don't need a whole lot of space. It\u2019s top-notch for an entry-level SSD, but because of how bare-bones it is, you might need to be prepared for a very slightly more difficult process to set this up than with some other popular SSD choices.MY SITUATION:I\u2019m not precisely an IT professional, but I do deal with all the tech for the small business I work for, and I\u2019d rank my IT skills as medium-high. I'm working on updating the computers in an office with 16 employees, and with most of the computers needing a boost in speed, it's great to be able to buy several of these for a good price. The vast majority of our work documents are stored in shared locations, so none of our computers need a whole lot of space\u2014our staff are generally only using 50-70GB on their drives for the OS and a pretty standard array of programs, so 120GB is the perfect size for us.Because most of our computers are at least three years old, the hardware only supports SATA II, so we're not seeing the huge improvement in speed that we might if we were going from HDDs to upper-limit SATA III speeds, but regardless, speeds have more than doubled in the four computers I've swapped these into so far, and users are seeing improvements, particularly in startup speeds for the computer (from more than 3 minutes down to 30 seconds) and for individual programs. See images for CrystalDisk comparison before and after on one of the machines. I'll post an update once I put together the brand new build I'm about to do with one of these.ISSUES IN THE PROCESS:I did run into a couple of issues that threw me off while installing these. The first was that the drive would not show up after hooking it up in the case and rebooting. It didn\u2019t show in This PC or in Computer Management. The solution was to run Windows Memory Diagnostic, which is easily found through the start menu and took maybe 5-10 minutes to run on the two computers that had this issue. After that, I was able to see the disk in Computer Management, and I GPT partitioned each of the drives from there. See pieced together image for visuals on the process for getting this settled.The other slight hiccup I had was the computer refusing to boot from the drive once I removed the old HDD; this was easily resolved by changing the boot mode in the BIOS from Legacy to UEFI, which was necessary because I had partitioned them all as GPT.OTHER NOTES:I planned on mounting all of these with some heavy-duty Velcro we have lying around the office, which I\u2019ve heard several places is fine because SSDs don\u2019t have moving parts, so they don\u2019t need to be held super-steady, and skipping a mounting bracket saved about $6 per drive (which is nice when buying several). The Velcro is doing just fine for three of the drives, and the fourth computer, conveniently, had a hot-swap bay with a 3.5 slot on one side (where the old HDD was), and a 2.5 spot on the other side that worked perfectly with some spare screws from the last case I bought.",

                "reviewText": "Using it for lubuntu currently for the last few months in an old 2010ish acer aspire one 533, works well with write cache enabled, pretty fast for what it is, very cool running even when loaded down. Seems to be very well made for the money, no cheap plastic case, uses real Kingston flash memory too and more incredibly a phison nand flash controller, most cheap SSD's use some cheap junk from some unknown hongkong special but not this one. Very good value, buy this over that other junk from TeamGroup, pny or even sandisk \"excluding their top of the line SanDisk Ultra series, those are actually good\" But yes, A Samsung Evo 870 will cream both this in terms of specs and speed, but for the price, it's better than anything else cheaper or the same cost, it is certainly better than an overpriced wd blue ssd drive too and CHEAPER by about 40 bucks. I just got another A400 480gb model on the way to use in another 2009ish netbook, this time, a Compaq c110 mini which has windows 7 on it, tho to get it to run as efficiently and reliably as possible, much like with Linux, you do have to tweak some things if you really wanna be picky like I am., Even without doing anything, I know this drive will still last forever pretty much. These are one of the drives a recommend to all the people I know who want a real product.",

The speed of this SSD is truly remarkable, and it has transformed my computing experience. The improvement is so significant that my laptop now operates at least 10 times faster than before.The most noticeable change is in the speed at which files load and applications open. Tasks that used to take minutes are now completed in a matter of seconds. The overall responsiveness of my laptop has seen a dramatic boost, making multitasking a breeze. I no longer find myself waiting impatiently for files to load or applications to start.One of the most impressive aspects of this Kingston SSD is its lightning-fast boot time. My laptop now starts up in a mere 7 seconds, providing me with instant access to my work and reducing downtime substantially. This has been a game-changer for my productivity, especially when time is of the essence.Beyond the incredible speed, the installation process was straightforward, even for someone with limited technical expertise. The durability and reliability of Kingston as a brand have always been commendable, and this SSD lives up to those standards. In conclusion, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase, and I would highly recommend the Kingston SSD to anyone looking to enhance the performance of their laptop.
