                "reviewText": "The Crucial P5 Plus is quite a fast Gen 4 SSD. Unfortunately I only have a board with Gen 3 PCI-e so I can't unlock it's full speed but there's hardly a reason to. It easily saturates 3,300MB/s that my current mainboard is capable of doing.For me this is plenty. File transfers, video recording & editing, gaming & modding, 2D art, multitasking, compiling, unpacking & repacking and desktop environment are all lightning fast and Windows environment responds nearly instantly. I appreciate the pre-installed heatsink which is quite heavy for its small size, but still easily fits in the M.2 slot which is directly beneath my video card. During a CrystalDiskMark bench it barely reached 70-80C during stress test. Under normal operation it's more like 25-50C.Installation was super easy, no issues detecting or getting Windows to install on it and it comes pre-partitioned for your convenience.All in all, a fantastic drive for PC or consoles.",

When exporting large quantities of photos, I notice no difference in the write speeds between my internal SSD and this Crucial drive. When I copy/share large files via secondary attached USB memory, it also seems highly responsive. I basically use this device for large temporary projects/files, including photo and video editing. I am not using it for gaming. Overall, I'm quite pleased with the choice -- it was a great value, worked as advertised, and so far, I have not had any issues whatsoever.",
