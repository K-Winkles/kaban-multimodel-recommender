From power on to full Windows boot up took right around 5 minutes on the old drive, and now that time has been slashed to less than 40 seconds. I mean....wow. It feels like I brand new PC. Chrome loads in 3 or 4 seconds vs. 20+. Even software updates are incredibly quicker. Should have done this a long time ago, but finally made the switch when the price dropped below $50",
