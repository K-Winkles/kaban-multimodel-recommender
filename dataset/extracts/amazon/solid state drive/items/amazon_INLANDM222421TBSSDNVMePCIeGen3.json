                "reviewText": "Looking to upgrade from Samsung 950Pro 256gb to larger NVMe. Found this Inland Premium 1tb for such a good price, went ahead and pulled the trigger. Was skeptical due to the few reviews, however, they were all positive. The worst case would send back.Pros1. Price/size: Very affordable NVMe 1TB for about a Benjemin2. Performance: The performance is up there near the Samsung range at half the cost or better. CrystalDiskMark snapshot added. This is after installing 55gbs on 1tb drive.Unknowns1. Longevity: This remains to be seen. Will definitely report back should I have any early failuresIssuesHad an issue booting after clone. I believe this might have been due to the Samsung 950Pro running on Samsung proprietary driver which would be incompatible with the Inland Premium as it would use standard Win10 box driver. Tried Recovery of the clone without resolution. Ended up installing from scratch. Not a huge issue with the exception of time involved. However, I believe the Samsung 950Pro NVMe was cloned from a Standard SSD, which was upgraded from WinXP to Win10. Clean install was probably the right way to go in the end.Update 12/15/2021 - So this SSD is still working flawlessly on my rig. Granted I am not doing Raid or anything of that sort, so mileage may vary. But I have had ZERO issues and no drop in performance. I have just purchased another 1Tb of this make and model for a laptop. Feeling pretty good about it as long as the manufacturers have not changed the build on it to a lesser design. Often some manufactures do this without advertising or communicating it. But, I will certainly let you all know should I run into any issues.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Fast and Inexpensive NVME",
                "reviewText": "I held off buying NVME drives for a long time because SATA SSDs were cheaper and were still hugely faster than older HDDs. But now some NVME SSDs are the same price as SATA SSDs and are faster, so it was time to upgrade. I use my Inland (Microcenter) NVME as my boot drive with a separate partition for gaming and it is flawless.Pros:+ PRICE! Why buy a SATA drive when an NVME is faster, costs the same, and has no cables?+ Fast! Phison E12 controller has similar performance to Samsung NVMEs that cost more than twice as much as Inland.+ Uses 512e sector size for easy cloning with other SSDs/HDDs if you need to. (The Sabrent Rocket uses 4K sector size, which may cause problems with cloning depending on your software. If you clean install, this doesn't matter!)+ Runs cool. It's usually around 35C when doing basic computing and jumps to a whole ~40C when loading a game. I maxed out at 66C benching with CrystalDiskMark. When copying game files from one SSD to my Inland, I maxed out at 64C. When copying game files from an HDD, it was under 60C. Unless you're working with HUGE files or copying lots of files back and forth constantly, it's not going to overheat on you. I'm using a Ryzen 1500X with a tower cooler, and my NVME slot is located between the CPU and GPU. I have a Meshify C case with 2 140mm intake fans and 2 120mm exhaust fans, so it has plenty of airflow.+ If you do install an aftermarket heatsink, the drive is mostly bare. You won't have to worry about voiding a warranty by removing stickers. More manufacturers should do this!Cons- Most other Phison E12 controller NVME drives have 5 year warranties. Inland's is only 3 years.- Doesn't come with any software for upgrading firmware or monitoring drive health and such. Not a big deal. I use HWiNFO64 for monitoring drive health anyway.",

I installed it on my legion Go, I haven't actually measured the performance so I cant say for sure but immediately after installing it my Legion was running faster. It felt more snappy, it booted faster, it boots games faster. I cant say for sure but it felt faster.I have 2 major complaints, the price is the first one. 160 is so expensive for an SSD but at the same time there's so few 2242 SSDs that I cant really complain. I should be mad at lenovo but I digress. 2nd I cant comment on the longevity of the product. Ive used it for a month now and its fine but many of the 1 star reviews on amazon are about the inland drive failing and on reddit people have been complaining about their microcenter 2tb legion go failing. (the drive swap with this SSD)4 star for price but I am cautious",
