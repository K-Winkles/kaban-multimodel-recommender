                "reviewText": "UPDATE: They removed the word \"shield\" from the item description which is great. I can confirm if you remove the rubber from the T7 Shield, it actually fits perfectly. They are a little taller than the T7 which actually makes them a bit easier to take out. Bumping up from 2 stars to 4 for removing the word shield from the description, it works as designed. Now I'd love to see one made for the shield specifically!Original Review: I've been using these Hermit Shells for years and love them with the Samsung T5's and T7's. I was super excited to see one \"made for the T7 Shield\" and this my friends is not it. I threw a T7 in to show how they are supposed to fit, snug and flat, Would love if they could make this just a tiny bit bigger to fit the shield as advertised.",
