                "reviewText": "TL;dr \u2013 it works great. Treat it with respect, be prepared to toss the cable it comes with (because they fail) and enjoy a huge amount of storage for a reasonable amount of money.You\u2019ve probably read a ton of reviews on external drives and have arrived here. I\u2019ve been in the tech biz over 44 years and was there when 128Kbyte 8\u201d floppy disks were considered advanced. I\u2019ve used a LOT of different drives.Let\u2019s put this drive into perspective: it is NOT a \u201cportable drive\u201d, it\u2019s an external drive that you can choose to move from place to place. AS WITH ALL SUCH DRIVES, it contains precision moving parts; if you drop it, it will likely break. If you move it around when it\u2019s operating, it probably won\u2019t like it. If you drop your laptop, it will likely break. If you want an external drive that you can really move around, get an SSD.I purchased one of these drives for cloud-storage and archival purposes. Simply put, I needed somewhere to dump large data collections for essentially read-only access as well as having a buffer area for cloud storage synchronization purposes (lots of r/w access to the drive). It worked so well I purchased another and might even get a 3rd.Cloud storage is great for frequently accessed data, but for your video collection, your vast music collection or the 130GB of pictures your spouse took last month, you might want off-line storage. This is a great choice.Is it fast? Slower than an SSD but faster than many external hard drives out there. If you want speed, use the local SSD in your device or get an external SSD drive. If you don\u2019t want that expense, this is still a great drive.In operation the drive is whisper quiet and runs slightly warm. You may have read about the \u201cclick of death\u201d, well, yeah, it happened to me too. It won\u2019t run on an overloaded unpowered USB hub (click, click due to lack of power). The cable it comes with is frankly troublesome and honestly you should invest in a replacement. Yup, click, click, click because the cable failed (fortunately I had another to hand, doesn\u2019t everyone?). All that will happen with other drives too, so it\u2019s nothing unusual.My system: Win10 Pro and Win10 Home on Lenovo, Surface Books and Surface Pro; works out of the box just fine.For those complaining that the drive doesn\u2019t work with some backup software; that\u2019s not the drives fault. For those complaining about the speed for gaming purposes, that\u2019s not the drives\u2019 fault either, you should have purchased an SSD.Yes, it will work with Onedrive; just create a junction from your Onedrive folder to the required folder in the external drive.mklink /J srcFolder destFolderSince you have a large capacity drive for large data sets, robocopy (part of Windows) will be your friend as well as mklink to create junctions from your main drive to connection points in external drives filesystems.What happens if the drive goes down? As with any other drive, you might have lost your data. The solution is to (gasp) purchase two drives and sync one with the other.Pro\u2019s: 5TB of storage for <$100. Quiet, fast and gets the job done. It\u2019s a disk drive, it\u2019s not there to be exciting.Con\u2019s: I didn\u2019t like the cable; invest $6 on a better one. As with ALL DRIVES, you need to treat it nicely.",

This thing is quite small, about the size of 6 gerbal tails or 15 mice tails in width. You say thats a strange way of measuring? I got my system, you go have yours! It weighs next to nothing. About the weight of 4 trix crackers or half a pen. Its super fast (thats what she said) and it has worked perfectly since I got it, unlike my uncle Gerrard that can keep work if his life depended on it. Its priced well, and is super compact. Its NOT waterproof or water resistant as I found out trying to load home movies onto it while showering. Ruined both my computer and this...I thought...but I let it dry to a fortnight and it worked just fine. If you are looking for something small, capable and priced well, my uncle gerrard is available. This also fits that description.",
