The capacity you get in such a small size is extremely useful for storing tons of data in something you can toss in a pocket or bag easily. I haven't really hammered it, but performance seems fine.I'm using one on a Raspberry Pi 4 in lieu of an SD card. These are better than SD cards and even regular thumb drives because they have a controller on them which allows you to support functions like garbage collection and TRIM. If you just need something for carrying files then you may not care about things like that, but this will work in those cases as well.",

                "reviewText": "I mostly use this to edit video off of. Store the files on it, and it feels about as fast as my internal SSD. Highly recommend.Purchasing another!(250gb version)---update---The above purchases were great, so i gave them to friends and bought the bigger version for myself.As soon as I plugged it into the computer, I've been having issues. Froze up my computer, crashed it. Super weird, because that's never happened by plugging in an external drive. I reinstalled my version of windows after, because everything got a little funny.I exchanged it for another 1tb version, and I'd say it works about half the time.I don't know if it's quality control, or the smaller sizes just work better, but really confusing.------------------update again----------------After getting into contact with the manufacturer, I believe issues are resolved! Bonus points added back for customer service, and day 1 of testing replacement drive things seem to be working as they should. Pretty stoked again!",

                "reviewText": "I bought 2 of these SSD drive. A 150Gb and 1T. They work well and write fast enough for my needs. The only flaw both have is that they disconnect after a while, specially when copying a lot of files. It may be due to overheating but I\u2019m not sure. I had to restart large transfers many times because of that issue. Overall satisfied for the price still.",

                "reviewText": "This drive is pretty speedy! I'm running my Raspberry Pi 4 from it, and I'm quite happy.Note that you can't BOOT the pi from it, but you can have the next best thing.... You can run your RPi from it, but you do have to do the initial boot from the SDCard. Once booted, though, all the disk access is on the SDCard.A couple of things to be aware of:1) This drive is a 4k sector drive. This means just burning an sdcard image with RPI Imager or Win32 disk imager WILL FAIL. They seem to expect 512 byte blocks. It just writes a corrupted filesystem to the drive.2) It works fine after boot.3) I tried everything I could think of, but the RPI4 will NOT boot from this device for some reason.4) Not all is lost - you can move your / filesystem to the SSD and gain the speed and durability advantages. You will have to book from the sdcard, however.I tried every way possible to boot from it, but could not get it to work. I even manually created a FAT32 boot partition and a copy of a root ext4 filesystem by hand, and it would not boot.Here's how I got it to work.Steps taken on the Raspberry Pi:delete original partition on the SSD and create new ext4 partition with gparted (gparted usually needs to be installed)mount the SSD ext4 partition (I used /mnt/target)copy the current OS partition to the newly created on on the SSD. (I used \"sudo rsync -axv / /mnt/target\"). This takes about 5 minutes on my pi4Bget the PARTUUID of the SSD ext 4 partition you just copied. (I used \"sudo blkid\" and found the PARTUUID for the partion on /dev/sda)backup /boot/cmdline.txt to cmdline.sdedit the /boot/cmdline.txt, replacing the PARTUUID with the one you just found for the partition you created on /dev/sdaXedit the fstab **ON THE SSD** and replace the PARTUUID for / with the SSID you just put in cmdline.txt. (I used \"sudo vi /mnt/target/etc/fstab\") Don't edit the regular /dev/fstab! Because of the change above, it will never bee seen. Again! Edit the fstab ON THE SSD filesystem you just created.reboot.You can confirm the device is running on the new SSD by using \"findmnt -o -n SOURCE /\" and it should show a partition on /dev/sdaHas been running OK for me for a while. Search raspberry Pi Forums for more information and detailed instructions.",
