                "reviewText": "I used this to replace the 500 GB 5400 RPM hard drive on an old Toshiba C55t laptop. I normally go with the major brand names on hard drives, but this one had a low price and it wasn't for my primary computer so I figured I would give them a chance. The old drive it was replacing had acceptable sequential read/write scores around 100 MB/s, but the random access sustained speeds were an abysmal 1 MB/s. Queue the upgrade.I ran CrystalDiskMark before and after the upgrade. My final scores were a modest 2.5x the original speed for sequential reads, but a 20x-75x improvement on the random access score. Yeah! This computer boots up much more quickly now.For anyone else tackling this and has some experience doing things like this, here's the process I used. I was cloning a Windows 10 drive. First, note that this is a 480 GB drive and the original one was a little larger at 500 GB. This requires some extra work to shrink things down before cloning. I used some open source tools to handle this, but there are probably commercial copy programs that would handle this. The first step was that I shrunk my C: drive by about 30GB using Disk Management. Next, I booted up to GParted and shrunk the C: partition and scooted the hidden partitions after it over into the gap that was left. The end result is 30GB of unallocated space at the end of the drive. Next, I booted a Clonezilla disk to perform the copy, with my new drive in an enclosure. Expert mode has a setting which allows copying to a smaller drive. Other than that, the default settings worked for me. At the end, I put the new drive in the computer and it booted right up.",

It greatly improved the speed of my 2016 laptop, although, looking at the XG500 SSD critically, it\u2019s not a fast drive. To test it, I connected it to the 12th generation motherboard of my recently upgraded desktop. Its read and write speeds using the CrystalDiskMark testing software were just OK at 558 mb/s for the highest read score and 470 mb/s for the highest write score. As a comparison, the M2 boot drive in the same computer, which itself is not a particularly fast drive, easily surpassed it at 1,841 mb/s read and 953 mb/s write. The LinkMore drive is best suited for exactly the purpose I\u2019ve put it to, boosting the speed of an older laptop and thus giving it new life.",
