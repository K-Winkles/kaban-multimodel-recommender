                "reviewText": "I initially bought a slightly cheaper drive by a brand I don\u2019t know. Totally didn\u2019t work. Tried various things but it was just a bad drive. Read a bit and found good info on hp drives, and this worked perfectly on an older MacBook Pro from 2009, 2011, and another 2012. Works internally or externally with usb-to-sata adapter- no troubles at all. Speedy, good space, just overall a superior experience. I think it\u2019s worth that extra $5-10. Very solid. Nicely put together. Is it the ultimate speed? I can\u2019t say but far faster than sata hard drives. It\u2019s running on an older machine but is a great upgrade, and really improved overall usability on those laptops. I\u2019ve only used a month but so far it\u2019s great. Zero complaints. Even arrived next morning 7am.",

Copying data is easy and it booted right up.If you have a slow computer (with a Sata interface) replacing a mechanical drive with an SSD wil increase your performance. Mechanical drives required condensing as files were added and deleted, leaving files on faster or slower accessable parts of the disk. SSDs don't have that issue as all sections are accessed at the same speed. They can also reduce the internal heat in the computer.",
