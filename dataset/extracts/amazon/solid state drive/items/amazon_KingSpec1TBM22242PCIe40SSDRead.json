You can use \"Disk Management Tool\" to format and partition the SSD and then use it in \"Windows Explorer\". Why is the product capacity shown on my computer not 1TB or 2TB? Because the manufacturer's calculation method is 1TB=1000MB=1,000,000KB=1,000,000,000B, while the computer system's calculation method is 1TB=1024MB=1024*1024KB=1024*1024*1024B, so the capacity is 1TB=(1000*1000*1000)/(1024* 1024*1024)TB\u22480.93TB. Why does the KingSpec XG7000 NVMe Gen 4x4 SSD not reach the tested speed of 7200MB/s? The nominal speed is tested when connected to the PCIe Gen 4x4 interface. If connected to PCIe Gen 3x4 interface, the speed will be limited to around 3500MB/s. If tested in an SSD chassis, the speed will be limited by the chassis. Can the KingSpec XG7000 NVMe Gen 4x4 SSD 2242 support Legion go? NO, the KingSpec XG7000 NVMe Gen 4x4 SSD 2242 uses double-sided modules and cannot be installed into Legion Go because Legion Go requires single-sided modules.",

I\u2019ll update this review if/when I do. Regardless, the SSD claims 3.4 GB/s speed, the enclosure I have claims 10Gb/s (1.25GB/s) speed as does the USB 3.2G2 c port. My results 1GB/s (8Gb/s). Plenty fast for my needs as a external drive, but my SSD enclosure/USB is likely the limiting factor.You will likely fare better price-per-GB with the larger 2280 form factor if you can install it in your system, but the smaller 2242 drive may be required for certain smaller devices (e.g. mini-PCs).Bottom Line:Good NVME M.2 Drive.",

                "reviewText": "The 2230 form factor is for small devices such as the SteamDeck, and small laptops. Before you even consider this item make sure that your intended device is \"M\" key and supports 2230. These are even smaller than the small 2240 drives that have sparse support to begin with.Being an \"M\" key, these are strictly NVMe devices. This limits your device/enclosure compatibility. That said, these are special purpose drives. I'm not going to post benchmarks because I cannot test this one at full speed. I did install it on an older laptop and it has made a huge performance difference above the OEM provided drive.I did not read the fine print, but the 15 year warranty will likely outlive the device you install this to. I have purchased other KingSpec 3D NAND devices previously and they have been running 24/7 for years with no issues. I have confidence in them among the budget brands. You can find other brands cheaper, but this is a brand I trust.",

Skepticism aside, I decided to give it a shot, and boy, am I glad I did! The drive not only turned out to be real, but it exceeded my expectations.Firstly, the packaging was solid and well-protected, ensuring the NVMe drive arrived in pristine condition. It's always a relief when you order a tech component, and it's delivered with care.Installation was a breeze. I was a bit apprehensive about compatibility, especially since I was installing it on my 64GB Steam Deck. However, the NVMe drive slid into place seamlessly, and within minutes, I had expanded my storage to a whopping 1TB. Talk about a game-changer!The speed and performance of this drive are remarkable. Games load faster, and the increased storage space allows me to carry an extensive library on my Steam Deck without worrying about running out of room. It's like having a portable gaming powerhouse in the palm of my hands.What truly sets this NVMe drive apart is its unbeatable price. While I initially questioned whether it was too good to be true, the product delivered on all fronts. It's a testament to the fact that quality tech doesn't always have to come with a hefty price tag.In conclusion, if you're in need of additional storage for your gaming setup and come across this NVMe drive, don't hesitate. It's a fantastic investment that won't break the bank. My Steam Deck has never been happier, and neither have I. Kudos to the makers of this incredible product!",
