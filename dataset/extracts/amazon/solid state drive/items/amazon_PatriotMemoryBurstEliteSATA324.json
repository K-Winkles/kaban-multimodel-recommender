Not bad for use in a USB3 enclosure.PRO: Decent price point for a 240 GB SSD at time of purchase ($27 in March 2022) Brand is recognizable from PC RAMCONS: None at this time.Overall, a decent small SSD.

Its random read rate isn't as good, but it can read sequential files very fast.This is a SATA 3 SSD. I have tested this on an older machine and does work fine with SATA 2 ports. However, the data transfer rate is limited to that of the older SATA 2 bus. If you aren't getting full speed on your data transfer, your computer or adapter might have an older SATA bus.I would buy it again.",

                "reviewText": "Same issue as other reviewers. After some time, access and write speeds will slow to nearly zero (less than one MB, yes, 1 megabyte). Good luck trying to get all your data off if this happens. Windows shows the drive is at 100% utilization, but access only happens in short bursts. The drive will lock up your system, crash applications that try to access it, take down other USB devices if using over USB, and prevent your system from doing a clean shutdown. The same problem was observable whether on a direct SATA connection or using a SATA to USB 3.0 adapter. Checking S.M.A.R.T. data shows the SSD getting very hot despite being out in the open. There is likely a critical issue with the controller firmware (which there are no updates for). I have attached images showing the issues. Don't let the read speeds in my image fool you, when trying to transfer my large files off the SSD speeds look like the write speeds in the image. Stay away from these Patriot SATA SSDs.",
