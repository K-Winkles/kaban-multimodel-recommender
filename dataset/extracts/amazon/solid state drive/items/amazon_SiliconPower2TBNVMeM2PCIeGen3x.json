                "reviewText": "I bought this SSD to upgrade my laptop's storage and I'm very happy with the performance and price. It was easy to install and recognized by Windows 10 without any issues. The drive is very fast, especially for sequential reads and writes, and it handles most tasks without slowing down. It also has a black PCB and a 5-year warranty, which are nice bonuses.The only drawbacks are that it doesn't have a software toolbox for monitoring or updating the firmware and that it has lower endurance than some of its competitors. However, these are minor issues for me, as I don't plan to use the drive heavily or for a long time. For the price, this SSD is hard to beat, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a budget-friendly NVMe SSD with TLC NAND.",

                "reviewText": "For a M.2 NVMe drive, I like that the packaging is very small & lightweight.It's also a plus that relevant technical info is displayed on the package rather than drawings of racing cars and rockets for example.This shows that the product is also made with power-users in mind thus a simple, clear package print.For the SMART capability it's somehow not seen by all Windows programs, some can get it and some can't.Perhaps the drive must be physically plugged into the real motherboard to get it everywhere (I plugged it into a USB adapter).For the details it's a 512-bytes physical sector size, so it's best to also make sure that your partitions match it (512-bytes chunk/cluster-size), and I don't think that 512-bytes is at all a problem for any M.2 drive anyway.The packaging also says Supports NVMe 1.3, but the drive appears to support the newer NVMe 1.4 as well.So it supports both NVMe 1.3 & NVMe 1.4 (it's still Gen3x4, but NVMe 1.4 itself cans still be used).The drive supports SMART, TRIM & VolatileWriteCache.Another thing worth knowing about is that for another drive model the shipments were sometimes shipped without temperature sensor so a static value was returned always.There were two versions and either of the two were selected at random for shipping.I don't know if it's the case for this NVMe model, but it would be much better to just always ship the temperature sensor-enabled versions always.Otherwise it's hard to know when the drive needs to take a break due to heat (which cans happen while doing I/O-heavy stuff, like mass-copying or intensive random reads for gaming).For the price it's a rare find, this product is priced neutrally, neither too low nor too high.Perfect price-match for getting hold of a 1TB NVMe drive nowadays.More (basic) drive info: Disk geometry: Cylinders: 124519 Tracks/Cylinder: 255 Sectors/Track: 63 Bytes/Sector: 512 Total disk sectors: 0 Logical sector size: 512 Physical sector size: 512 Media rotation rate: N/A Buffer size: N/A ECC size: N/AThe rest wasn't able to be reliably acquired over my USB adapter.However it's worth noting that 'Trusted Computing' is unsupported - good news, it was rather 'anti-user computing' anyway.Therefore this NVMe drive won't agree to work against you for 'trusted' purposes.This product is one the cheaper 1TB NVMe drives, and yet it matches a pretty good quality alike any higher-priced one.",

I\u2019m pretty IT savvy and it took a lot of work to figure out it simply wasn\u2019t going to do the job. Several times it rendered my computer unable to boot without first utilizing a recovery disk and some more advanced commands than the average user would likely be comfortable with.TL;DR good drive, use other software to clone your drive.",
