                "reviewText": "About 8 months ago I tried a couple of the 1TB Thumb Drives out there for storing large video files on. Quickly I found myself with corrupted files, lost file, having to reformat, etc., and vowed NEVER AGAIN. Upon purchasing a new tablet to replace my old one, I was shocked to find no microSD slot so I was extremely short on memory. I figured I'd give the 1 TB SSK SSD a shot. I've used it over a week now, writing, rewriting, erasing, editing, and transferring files plugged into my Win11 tablet, my Fire tablet, my Win11 laptop and my Win 10 desktop with absolutely no problems! Not a single write error, corrupted file, missing file, etc. This gets a solid 5 star for me for stability. I haven't been paying attention to the speed as the heaviest use is on my desktop which is not USB 3.x so that would be unfair, and tell you the truth, that's a moot point to me. I wanted something stable that could be successfully plugged into multiple machines and this fits that ticket perfectly!!",
