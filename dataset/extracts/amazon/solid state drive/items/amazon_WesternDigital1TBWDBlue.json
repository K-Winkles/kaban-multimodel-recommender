                "reviewText": "I wanted to add a second SSD to my system as my original Samsung SSD is almost 10 years old. Black Friday sealed the deal. As my home build only had two bays and they were both in use, I bought the Corsair Dual SSD Mounting Bracket which allowed me to put the old SSD and new SSD in the same bay (they stack on top of each other). I also planned to clone the new drive as a boot drive. When I ran the Arconis program (that you download off the WD website) and waited two hours I got a warning from Windows (when I tried to boot) that the new drive was corrupted when I tried to boot from it. I made two attempts. It just wouldn't work. A YouTuber had recommended the trial version of Macrium Reflect cloning software. I downloaded that and followed along on the provided video on their website. Super easy. I did have to go into the BIOS to change the boot order as I left the Samsung in place as a backup drive. Overall the WD drive works perfect but I recommend using Macrium to clone the drive.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m new to SSD tech, and my laptop is about 6 years old and was terribly bogged down by Windows 11 background processes \u2014 chiefly Windows Search Indexer. So, I thought maybe said I switch out the drives, I won\u2019t have to get an all new computer in these tough economic times.Short story is that it worked eventually, and the drive is much quicker. When I run chkdsk on it, it does stop and say a couple of error were found, so I\u2019m not exactly feeling totally secure in it, but it does seem to function now that I have it installed.It wasn\u2019t till after I opened the Dell laptop that I saw that it has a slot for the other type of SSD that doesn\u2019t have this traditional shape and SATA connector \u2014 and I read that those are even faster, the ones that look like a skinny motherboard and.plug into a slot. I would have gone with that style had I known. Oh well.This drive comes with nothing but the drive. So, you\u2019d need a separate USB connector if your laptop only has one drive interface. And then you also have to go to the WD website to download software to do any cloning and backup \u2014 it\u2019s called Acronis. And it was tough to work with.If you are trying to clone via USB, then you have to pull out the original drive and hook that up to the USB cable. And then you have to put the new SSD inside the laptop. If you have two slots none of this matters. But the new drive has to be inside of the computer for it to be made bootable on that computer. Allegedly, it will not boot up if you use any exterior cloning devices. The main problem was that it kept saying it was unable to \u201clock\u201d the new drive. I tried a bunch of stuff and pulled out an ancient PC to try and get it going. I must\u2019ve tried fitty \u2018leven different times, but eventually I did hit the correct combination of elements. Pain in the behind, but it is possible.Does not make up for a slow processor or display that doesn\u2019t look very good, and battery that won\u2019t hold a charge \u2014 but it has refreshed my ability to get work done. Also, turn off Windows Search Indexer. Stupid waste of resources.",

                "reviewText": "Reliability of SSDs has been sketchy since 2021. Samsung is no exception and they have one of the worst RMA service ever in Canada. In this context, I chose the next best with a decent RMA service in Canada: Western Digital.So far, I am quite happy with my purchase. It came in perfect health and is still at perfect health after cloning my old Toshiba HDD on it. So far, so good. My SSD is of the newest generation and was manufactured May 23rd 2023. Speed is as advertised. My computer gets to the log in screen much faster and all the background apps load super fast. Games are impacted too, of course. Initial game launch, loading saved games and loading between levels takes half the time it used to take with my old 7200 rpm HDD. Even the graphics are impacted because textures load much quicker.One thing I am not so sure about, though, is the Acronis True Image software that is provided. It is rather clunky and people have had problems cloning with it (errors, having to wipe the SSD and try again), so I decided not to use it, especially after I saw that it would hang for over a minute just when I clicked to bring up the cloning tool. That is NOT normal. If it hangs so much on that step, imagine how it will struggle when doing the actual cloning. I wanted to go with the free version of AOMEI, but apparently they have put their cloning tool behind a paywall. I ended up using Macrium True Reflect (free trial), but there are plenty others which would have done just as nicely. I was able to adjust my partitions exactly to my liking.I hope I got one of the reliable ones and that it will not fail before several years. I will update my review if anything happens.",

Porque dentro de la torre no sufre golpes ni nada por el estilo.Es m\u00e1s... dentro est\u00e1 seguro y bien ventilado. Va sujeto con sus 4 tornillos.Antes de que me falle el sistema y pierda mis archivos decid\u00ed comprar uno y jubilar mi antiguo disco que es de la misma marca.Me lanc\u00e9 por un producto de segunda mano. Mi experiencia con estos productos es muy buena, ya que siempre los compro si hay en estado \"como nuevo\" y \"muy bueno\". Realmente vienen con alg\u00fan desperfecto en la caja original y poco m\u00e1s. Algo que no me importa, es recibir la caja un poco doblada o rota por alg\u00fan lado. Ya que el interior est\u00e1 bien y no afecta en su funcionamiento y much\u00edsimas veces no son usados. Lo mejor de todo es que siempre me ahorro un buen dinero.Voviendo al tema del disco duro... He de decir que no pesa mucho, es muy liviano.La verdad es que es buena marca y tengo buena experiencia con estos discos duros.La velocidad de cargar el sistema operativo es buena, bastante r\u00e1pida. El abrir carpetas y dem\u00e1s tambi\u00e9n. Todo muy fluido.Espero que me dure otros 7 a\u00f1os como me dur\u00f3 el otro disco duro. Recomiendo la marca y estos modelos en s\u00ed.",

                "reviewText": "I successfully used this 1TB WD SSD to increase the storage capacity inside my Eufy HomeBase 3.The drive is silent, generates no heat and handles the video disk transfer needs of seven 4K security cameras.Excellent price compared to other options, but more importantly, it works in the Eufy HomeBase 3 without any issues.The SSD\u2019s case has screw positions in exactly the same locations as a traditional 2.5\u201d disk drive, so the SSD can be used in most situations to replace one eg. a laptop.Very highly recommended.",
