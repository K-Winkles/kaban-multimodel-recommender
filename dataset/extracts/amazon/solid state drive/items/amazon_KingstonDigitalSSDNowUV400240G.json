                "reviewText": "This was my first SSD, and it's a really solid product. I just want to mention some points:1. Acronis didn't work - I ended up having to download AOMEI Backupper instead.The imaging software that was included did not work (Acronis). I just might be a massive idiot, but I installed Acronis on 3 different computers and tried to copy files onto the SSD. Every time it failed. I was told I would have to restart my computer and let the program copy files over once the computer booted up, but every time I restarted I was just thrown into the log in screen. I ended up using a 3rd party program called AOMEI Backupper. I got my files copied over without an issue in about 1.5 hours. If you're having trouble with Acronis, just download AOMEI, it's free and it works.2. Some large programs still load slowly.I want to be very clear about this - 95% of the programs people use will load quickly. My windows starts up in under 15 seconds. I can load Photoshop and Lightroom in about 15 seconds each. And smaller programs like word editors open within 1 second. So for most of the work I do, this SSD speeds me along. However, the SSD is still slow for some larger games on my computer. Shogun 2 Total War loads in 1 minute and 5 seconds. On my HDD it took about 2 minutes to boot up the game, so it is much faster on an SSD. However, it's not 15 seconds fast like other large applications on your computer. There are a ton of games that I can boot up in under 15 seconds. I'm not picking Shogun 2 to say that the SSD is bad, I'm just using it as an example to indicate that not everything you throw onto this SSD is going to boot in the blink of an eye.3. Working with large files is easierI can now save (export/write to disk) photos from my photo editing programs much faster. The main issue with HDDs is that they are slow, so you can store tons of photos on them but exporting and importing them is painfully slow. With this SSD I can move through photos fairly quickly, which is also a very safe thing because the less time my photos spend exporting the less of a chance something will happen that will screw up the export.Overall, I'm really happy with the purchase. For $100.00 you can update any old laptop and give it new life. The external enclosure is also quite nice because I can now carry around my old 1TB HDD in the case to store stuff I don't access that much. I'm almost tempted to go out and get another hard drive to use as a backup just because I have the enclosure and now know how to copy my computer for backup.",

                "reviewText": "No, it's not the fastest SSD you can buy, but it is certainly several times faster than a traditional hard drive, and at a great price. I used it in an older computer-- it makes it feel brand new! If you've never used an SSD, you don't know what you are missing. It is the most effective way I've ever seen to speed up a computer. And, it's cheaper than trying to upgrade the RAM, processor, motherboard, etc.In my tests, I found that it increased my computers boot time from about 60 seconds down to about 20 seconds. Programs open and close much faster, too. I found that it was about 5 times faster than my original hard drive in certain benchmarks, 100 times faster in others.If installing in a normal computer (not a laptop), you will probably need an extra bracket to make it fit into a normal hard drive slot. I used this product, but there are several others: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G57BN1M/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_15Since there are no moving parts, you don't technically need the bracket-- you can just jury-rig it into place, maybe even use zip ties if you want. But the bracket is more professional ;)",

                "reviewText": "I am dazzled by the speed, energy efficiency, reliability and low cost of solid state drives. They have been an unexpected delight. I used the current purchase to update a relatively old computer, and the improvement in time required to finish tasks is impressive. The only tricky part of this component installation was transferring information from a larger drive to a smaller drive. I used Acronis True Image Home to back up the (C:) partition, Recovery partition and EFI partition from the old C drive, and this information eventually filled about one-third of the new 120 GB SSD. I disconnected the old hard disk drive, re-booted the computer into the Acronis Rescue Environment using a previously-prepared CD-ROM and restored the backup information from the old boot drive to the new boot drive. To avoid competing boot drives on the same machine, I promptly renamed the Windows folder on the old hard drive to Windows.OLD, and there was no difficulty associated with this (but I used an old laptop with and external USB caddy for this step). I will probably wipe the old hard disk C partition when I am satisfied that the new configuration is hardy.",

So you can plug the ssd into the case, and basically use it like a giant thumb drive. Picture attached. (I put my old ssd in the case, so I have a nice big portable usb drive now.) It also came with spare cables that could be needed if you're installing on a standard pc motherboard.)Pro: Install process followed the standard ssd install, no weird quirks or anything. Just google your computer or laptop model with \"how to replace ssd in my <blah>\", you'll find a video that will teach you how to do it.Pro: I like the little kingston logo, the face. I told my kids that we have to put this person inside our computers to make them work. They ate it up.Maybe a con: It was shipped in a floppy manilla envelope... not exactly how I'd want my precious hard drive to be shipped. But I'm not deducting any points against it because the drives are apparently durable enough to have not been damaged at all. And if they were damaged, I could have just sent them back to Amazon.",

No s\u00f3lo inicia m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido el sistema operativo, sino que todas las aplicaciones se ejecutan m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido.Yo en mi port\u00e1til pude conservar mi disco duro original y ten\u00eda espacio para otro disco. No todos los port\u00e1tiles tienen espacio para dos discos. De ah\u00ed que si s\u00f3lo tienes sitio para uno, te asegures de coger uno de una capacidad m\u00e1s alta. Yo cog\u00ed uno de poca capacidad, ya que s\u00f3lo tengo el sistema operativo instalado en \u00e9l.Lo malo de aplicar en port\u00e1til con un SSD, es que tienes que volver a instalar el sistema operativo.\ud83d\udccd DIFERENCIA ENTRE DISCO HDD Y SDD\ud83d\udcbe DISCOS HDDLos discos HDD est\u00e1n compuestos de piezas mec\u00e1nicas, de ah\u00ed que a veces se le llame discos duros mec\u00e1nicos, y utilizan el magnetismo para grabar tus datos y archivos. Se compone de uno o varios discos r\u00edgidos unidos por un mismo eje y que giran a gran velocidad dentro de una caja met\u00e1lica. En cada plato y en cada una de sus caras, un cabezal de lectura/escritura lee o graba tus datos sobre los discos.De ah\u00ed viene el ruido que escuchas en algunos discos que producen al girar loe discos tan deprisa. Tambi\u00e9n producen otros ruidos como el t\u00edpico: clac, clac.Al ser f\u00edsica discos mec\u00e1nicos, con una aguja que va leyendo la informaci\u00f3n, pues el tiempo de lectura es m\u00e1s alto que un SSD. De ah\u00ed tambi\u00e9n, el no darle golpes al Pc, ya que un golpe fuerte pod\u00eda estropear el disco, por un impacto de la aguja.\ud83d\udcbd DISCOS SSDLos SSD son discos que utilizan memorias que mantienen la informaci\u00f3n almacenada cuando el disco se desconecta. No tienen cabezales f\u00edsicos para grabar los datos, en su lugar incluyen un procesador integrado para realizar operaciones relacionadas con la lectura y escritura de datos.Son discos que no dependen del giro de un componente f\u00edsico, por lo que se consigue que la una unidad sea m\u00e1s silenciosa que los discos mec\u00e1nicos. De echo, no producen ruido. Los discos SSD, con como una memoria USB, pero m\u00e1s grande y con m\u00e1s capacidad.Una similitud entre los discos HDD y SSD, es como escuchar m\u00fasica a trav\u00e9s de un CD o escuchar m\u00fasica en MP3 con un iPod. El acceso a la canci\u00f3n es mucho m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido en el iPod.\ud83d\udfe2 PROS* M\u00e1s silencioso que un disco HDD* M\u00e1s peque\u00f1o que un HDD. Suelen ser discos de 2,5\u201d por los 3,5 de un HDD* No producen vibraciones* Acceso a la informaci\u00f3n el doble de r\u00e1pido.* Transferencia de datos m\u00e1s elevada.* No le afectan los golpes.* Menor consumo.\ud83d\udd34 CONTRAS* M\u00e1s caros* Menor capacidad de almacenamiento\ud83d\udc4d CONCLUSI\u00d3NUn excelente SSD con un buen rendimiento y precio justo. Para ser una gama media cumple con todas las exigencias de un equipo de uso personal Muy buen rendimiento en relaci\u00f3n al costo/beneficio.",
