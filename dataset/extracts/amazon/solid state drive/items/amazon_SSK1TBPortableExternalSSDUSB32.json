I even tested another USB drive and it worked so idk why this one doesn't.Anyway, aside from that one quirk, the drive works like a dream. It's super small and ultraportable, doesn't overheat even when transferring 50+ gigabytes of files to it, and the included USB to USB-C adapter is a nice touch to take advantage of C's greater transfer speed. There is literally nothing like it I could find on amazon in the same price point, and it works really well so I'd 100% recommend to everyone except iPhone users, but it does work fine with Macs so idk what's up with that.",

I didn't time it exactly, but it's USB C speed for sure.Compare that to an alleged USB C flash drive -> 45 gb took hours. Excruciating,The drive comes in an enclosure at the price of a bare drive. That's key, because I am so tired of having to break out the tiny screwdrivers when I'm looking for files. The enclosure itself is good quality and stays cool. It also comes with a USBC to USB 3 cable with an adapter back to USBC.Would definitely buy again.",
