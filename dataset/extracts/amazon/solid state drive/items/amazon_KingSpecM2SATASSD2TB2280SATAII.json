I didn\u2019t have enough space so it was slowing my computer down and I bought this 256 GB SSD drive. It was very affordable and for a name brand. I don\u2019t want to buy a Chinese brand where it might fail and you lose everything. I haven\u2019t tested the speed but it\u2019s fast and works with no issues. I got only 239 GB even though it stated 256 GB on package. I suspect they meant bytes as seen in my first photo. I have no regrets purchasing this.",

I got this in late January and it worked well enough in my laptop for a couple months. In the middle of summer, though, it started displaying odd behavior, like randomly taking ages to load regular applications like Firefox. By the end of August, it became worse and worse to the point where it took 5 minutes to boot and even locked up my laptop in the middle of class. Unacceptable, even if cheap. Avoid.[The below is an addendum after going through the RMA process]RMA process went smoothly - you'll want to go through their email from your personal inbox rather than their website, though, if you want a faster reply. Emailing them directly got me a response in less than two days, going through their website took until I sent the SSD back to the first response.",
