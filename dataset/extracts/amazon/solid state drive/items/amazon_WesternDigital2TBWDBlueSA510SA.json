                "reviewText": "Short versionPros:Has a DRAM CacheDecent performance and price for a midrange SSD5-year WarrantyCons:Non-discounted pricing is atrocious250G version is not the best dealLong VersionAs someone who frequently refurbishes old hardware others throw out, I tend to ignore the \"midrange\" of SSDs. Either I'll buy something ridiculously cheap (like that time when a 128G ADATA SU650 was at $16), or spend <$50 on a 256G NVMe and throw in a budget 500G SSD when they dip under $50 or an old hard drive. Generally I would stay away from the more \"premium\" SSDs since smaller capacities aren't that good of a deal, and as a student I would prefer to spend less on hardware that I'm not going to use daily. If it is hardware that I either care about or something I use heavily, I'll probably just go for something from Samsung, Micron, or a SK Hynix Gold when Woot puts it on a discount again.This time however, I had a 2012 Macbook Air where the original drive it came with was really showing its age, especially an unresponsive keyboard during login, so I decided I would swap out the drive while doing some overdue maintenance, using a SSD adapter for the 2012 Macbook Air. Compared to the original drive (which I forgot to take a screenshot of the test results), the sequential read performed better, from ~430MB/s to ~490MB/s with little change for sequential write. However, the system was quite smoother (less stutter that was caused by the drive), and even though it doesn't hit the advertised speeds, I'm still very happy with the upgrade.Generally the WD Blue is actually an SSD that I would recommend my friends to buy if they're on a bit more of a budget, just because it's not outrageously priced, the warranty and performance is pretty good from past experience, and it has a DRAM cache which makes it excellent for a boot drive. It's just not something I would buy normally because of the use scenarios I have. Would I recommend it? Yes, as long as you're not paying for more than ~$70 for the 500G version and you're not considering the smaller capacities. >$40 for a 250G SSD is a bit steep, and the only time when the 250G version became a good deal was when one of my friends bought it at $45 each on somewhere that's not Amazon (which is a horrible price), but they accidentally shipped him two drives and they got to keep both.",
