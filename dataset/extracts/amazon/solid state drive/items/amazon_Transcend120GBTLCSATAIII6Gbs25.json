                "reviewText": "While it's not the fastest or the cheapest among the SSDs, it is still way faster than any conventional HD, even the 7,200 RPM models. I chose the 480GB unit over 512GB model because it was significantly cheaper.I cringe whenever people move about with the laptop in their hands while it's on and not in sleep or off mode. A sure way to potentially damage the HD. One of the main advantages of SSD besides the increased speed is no moving parts, thus it gives you the freedom to lug the laptop around without damaging it while it's on. When you've gone SSD, it's hard to go back to using conventional HD. I must have over dozen laptop HDs sitting in the drawer, merely serving as a backup drive in case SSD crashes and burns. I have installed about two dozen SSDs in laptops past four years. Luckily, none have failed thus far. I keep the original HDs because SSDs can and do fail from time to time.This 480 GB Transcend unit is performing admirably thus far in a Dell unit. I've used couple other Transcend SSDs in the past without any problems.",

The SSD Scope software included from transcend failed to image my old drive correctly and I had to manually install windows and all of my software. After that, everything worked perfectly.Performance is excellent for the price point of this drive (got it for $70ish for 480gb version on black Friday).So far been using for 6 months with zero issues, no studders, lockups and very fast load times for games like Forza Horizon 3, Witcher 3 and others.Very happy with purchase! Avoid relying on SSD scope to image your old drive!",

                "reviewText": "I have been buying Transcend disks for several years now, solid state, flash memory and spinners. I have found them to be reliable, less expensive than the big name brands, but also somewhat slower, so I buy them when speed is not that important to me. When speed is important I usually buy Samsung, but expect to pay a noticeable premium for that extra speed.I bought this drive as an external usb3 drive for a MacBook Air and enclosed it in a UASP optimized enclosure to use it to store digital photos when I travel. I have run speed tests on it and confirmed that it is somewhat slower (about 25% for writing, about the same for reading) than a similar Samsung SSD that I use on my main desktop for photo processing, but fast enough for what I want to do, and considerably less expensive than the Samsung. I have not noticed any of my Transcend drives becoming hot when used and, being solid state, they can be moved even when data is being written to or read from them.I use Transcend products in my digital camera, as auxiliary memory (the Transcend JetDrive) in my MacBook Pro and now as added memory to my traveling laptop and have never had an issue with any of the Transcend products. As I mentioned, they are not as fast as some of the more expensive products, but fast enough for use when the load is not too heavy and speed is not that important.",

I work as a computer repair/upgrade tech from home and I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality and speed of Transcend SSD drives.In the past 18 months I have replaced 5 or 6 old laptop and desktop hard drives with these SSD drives.Their reliability rating rivals Samsung for a fraction of the price. Speed tests usually show 550MBps read and 400+MBps write. Most laptop drives have a hard time pushing anything over 100MBps read and write.This helps for fast boot times and quicker launching programs. I have replaced these drives on everything from a low-end AMD E3 processor to an Intel Core i7. Obviously the better the processor the quicker the system.I have had zero problems or failures of these drives to date.I highly recommend this product!",

It went into an older but still very usable Gateway Core i7 desktop, 8GB RAM that is used for CS4 programs, mostly Photoshop and Premiere Pro. Cloned 290GB of system drive and data from a 1TB 7200 RPM Barracuda using the free version of EaseUs. Boot time dropped from 3 - 5 minutes to about 30 seconds, and program opening times are slashed. This computer is almost 5 years old and barring any major failures may well be usable for another 5. It's a better workstation than it was when it was new. Photoshop editing is quicker than any hardware I've ever worked on. I have yet to render video, but expect those times to be a third or less than in the past. I'm very pleased, this is my best computer technology purchase in years.",
