                "reviewText": "I got this product to replace the old 1TB SSD in my ASUS Rog Zephyrus G14. I'm a software programmer and was consistently running out of space on my laptop. However, I didn't exactly want to pay a lot of money for a Samsung SSD, and this SSD was on sale for $160 for 4TB. I thought it could be a bit fishy, but considering the feedback that was already received, I thought this SSD was worth the investment. I went for the 7350MB/s model because paying extra for +50MB/s seemed pointless, and my laptop would probably not see a big difference between the two models. Upon receiving the SSD, I thought cloning would be hard. I used a simple M.2 enclosure from best buy to facilitate the transfer, along with some online software I found.Installing was as simple as discharging my hands, opening up the laptop, and plugging the new SSD in. Upon rebooting my laptop, the bit-level clone on this new SSD worked first-try, so I didn't need to reinstall Windows or any other programs. Unity now builds my projects about 3x faster and programs that took a couple seconds to open up now open instantly. The SSD is even at 2% usage maximum when playing a game. I loaded up World of Warcraft and saw a drastic increase in my FPS, and cranked up the textures in Fortnite to \"Epic\" and still saw an increase in performance from when I previously ran the game on \"Medium\" textures.In conclusion, this SSD is a lot better than other M.2s on the market and didn't require extra drivers. To clone my data, I opened up the disk partitioner and initialized the disk in partition-table format, then created a single new volume on it. From there, I was able to identify the disk in the downloaded cloning software, which made more partitions on the drive and then cloned it. Cloning 1TB (minus 156gb) of data took about 30 minutes, then I shut down the computer and replaced the drive. Upon installation, the PC immediately booted up normally and I didn't have to install any software. A driver prompt appeared at first which I accepted, and after 1 restart, the only thing different with my PC was the new storage space and some crazy speed from this new SSD.I definitely recommend this, solid 10+1 out of 10.",

After looking at many different options (with quite a range of prices), I settled on this one given other positive reviews and the very favorable price for this size of drive. It's now been running in my PC daily for several weeks without any issues. The I/O specs on this drive were better than many out there in this price range. It has worked great for games and all other programs that I use daily.",

The heat sink doesn't come attached but that was a non-issue as it was very easy to do. Installed in the PS5 per Sony's instructions. Powered it back up and the drive was recognized immediately, prompting to be formatted for use. That was it. This drive is also faster then the internal drive (particularly on writes it seems), so moving games onto it can give you a slight performance boost.",
