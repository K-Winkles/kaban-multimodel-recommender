I am getting read and write speeds very close to what is given in the description, which are about 10 times what the original HDD did, and about as high as any SATA II SSD I've seen. Where it took a particular Linux distro over a minute to load before, it now only takes about 12 seconds and, of course, part of that time is the BIOS loading.I don't know how long this drive will last, but it sure lives up to it's speed specs and at an excellent price.",
