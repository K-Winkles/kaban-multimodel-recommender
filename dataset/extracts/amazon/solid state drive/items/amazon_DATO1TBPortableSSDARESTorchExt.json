                "reviewText": "this little drive is incredibly small and lightweight, but packs a serious performance punch. Over USB-C (using my own cable, rather than the USB-A -> USB-C cable it came with) I was able to pretty closely match the listing claims of 1000MB/sec in transfer speeds. I loaded this drive up with a bunch of 4K footage for a video project, and had no difficulty at all editing everything in real time.At the price point, this is also a good value. If you need a small, lightweight, large capacity and really fast external USB drive, this is a great option!",

                "reviewText": "In the digital age, we all need a reliable storage solution to keep our data safe and accessible, and the DATO ARES Torch 500GB Portable External Solid State Drive is here to meet that need. Designed for speed and durability, this sleek external SSD promises to safeguard your data while providing fast, convenient access when you need it.Blazing Fast Speeds:One of the key selling points of the DATO ARES Torch SSD is its impressive speed. With read and write speeds of up to 1050/1000 MB/s, this drive is built for efficiency, making tasks like data transfers, backups, and even running applications feel like a breeze. It connects via USB 3.2 Gen 2x1 Type C for super-fast data transfer rates.Durability and Portability:Built with a solid-state design, the ARES Torch is shock-resistant, protecting your data from accidental drops. Its compact form factor makes it an ideal companion for travelers and professionals who need to take their data with them on the go. The sleek, modern design is not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional, with a heat-dissipating aluminum surface.A Note on Speed:The read and write speeds of around 450MB/s when using the USB 3 connection falls short of the advertised 1050/1000 MB/s.
