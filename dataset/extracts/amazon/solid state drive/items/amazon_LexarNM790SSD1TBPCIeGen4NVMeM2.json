                "reviewText": "I purchased the Lexar NM790 SSD with Heatsink 1TB PCIe Gen4 NVMe M.2 2280 for my budget PC build, and I'm quite satisfied with its performance.The inclusion of the heatsink is a nice touch, as it helps keep the drive cool during heavy usage, ensuring consistent performance. The product's build quality appears to be decent, which is essential for long-term durability.The SSD has worked flawlessly for my needs, and I've experienced noticeable improvements in load times and overall system responsiveness. It offers good value for the price, making it an excellent choice for those on a budget.I'm pleased with my purchase and would definitely consider buying another Lexar NM790 SSD in the future.",

                "reviewText": "I'm using this for a data drive in a newly purchased computer. Access to the drive is very fast. The drive come unformatted, so, if using Windows, you must access the drive and format it through the Device Manager. It's an easy process (look it up on the web, if you don't know how) and everything works great. Very dependable. Since I've had this less than a month, I cannot say anything about its longevity, but I have used Lexar memory cards with no failures. I purchased this with the heat sink for added protection, although the other drive in the computer does not have one. Extra protection is always a better choice. I am pleased with the drive and am sure I will get many years of flawless performance.",

                "reviewText": "I've been looking at getting a larger NVMe SSD for a year or so now but prices have largely remained steady up until Fall off this year when they really started to get more affordable.This is replacing an older Gen 3 MP510 960GB. I was getting rather tired of having to pick and choose what I wanted installed on the drive.I picked the Lexar after reading numerous reviews and seeing nothing but positives.It's TLC based drive unlike most of the others around this price point for 4TB models. QLC drives have their own issues, the most concerning being longevity, as their NAND is much more easily worn out and typically do have any DRAM so in heavy or intense workloads they can drop to speeds like that of normal mechanical hard drive.It's got a rather high endurance rating, over twice the 1400 TBW of the drive out replaced. This was another reason for getting this as I don't have to worry about the drive failing due to exhausting the endurance. I'm sure I'll be looking gone before the drive would fail.One incredible thing is that Lexar managed to get all 4TB on a single side of the NVMe. Most drives they're on both sides making it harder to cool.My only con is that it does run quite warm. It does sit under my GPU and in general, idling on the desktop it can sit in the 50's. If your motherboard doesn't have a heatsink, you'll want to pick one up. I can't imagine how much worse it could be if I didn't have 2 140mm intakes on the side above the GPU blowing air down onto the board. I did buy a heatsink but have not yet installed it so I'll likely be looking at around a drop off 10-15C or more. If the extra $15-20 for the heatsink model didn't bother you, go that route.I will say I am hampering the drive as the m.2 slot it occupied is only a PCIE Gen 3 so it won't ever hit it's true speeds, but when I tested it, it was hitting the limit of the maximum bandwidth. I was getting identical read and write speeds capping out around 3500MB/s, a little less than half what the drive is capable of.If you're looking for speed, endurance, size options and a good price, the Lexar is the way to go. They've been in the storage game for a long time and have always been reliable for flash based storage",

                "reviewText": "I purchased a portable ORICO M.2 NVMe USB SSD enclosure to clone the almost full 128GB NVMe SSD that came in my Lenovo IdeaPad-3 14IIL05 laptop. I installed this new Lexar 2TB NVMe SSD in the portable USB enclosure, and used EaseUS Disk Copy Pro to clone the 128GB SSD to this Lexar 2TB NVMe SSD via the laptop USB port. The whole cloning process took about ten minutes. I then safely ejected the ORICO M.2 NVMe SSD USB enclosure containing the Lexar 2TB NVMe SSD. After removing the bottom of the Lenovo IdeaPad-3 14IIL05 laptop, I disconnected the small battery plug from the motherboard and removed the 128GB NVMe SSD from its slot and replaced it with the new Lexar 2TB NVMe SSD that I had removed from the ORICO M.2 NVMe SSD USB enclosure after the cloning process. I applied the longer thermal sticky pad that came with the new Lexar 2TB NVMe SSD, reconnected the battery plug on the motherboard, and reinstalled the bottom panel of the laptop. I plugged in the laptop power adapter and booted up the laptop. Everything is working perfectly. My Lenovo laptop now boots up much faster than before, and I now have a ton of extra drive space for music and videos. I'm 100% happy with this purchase!",
