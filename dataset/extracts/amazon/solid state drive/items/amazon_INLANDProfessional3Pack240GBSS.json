                "reviewText": "Are you a person who doesn't have a lot of money? Do you have a laptop that's almost 3 years old, and has had two drive replacements, both of which failed? Do you want to restore your laptop to its former glory? Then this drive is for you!Even if I've only had this SSD in for less than a week, I can say that it has made my laptop faster than ever. It also removed a very noticeable \"bulge\" from the last hard drive in here, which was a bit too thick for this laptop, even though it was 2.5in form factor. The laptop's boot time is much faster, it is overall much snappier than it has ever been, and it's also much quieter because of not having a 5,400RPM disc spinning inside it during its uptime.I might update this post way into the future, and I'll see if it fails really quickly or not. For now though, it's doing it's job very well, and I'm even tempted to buy it for my next PC build!EDIT 12/20/2018 -- It's still holding up, after a few months of every day continuous use. I have started to notice a faint buzzing noise while using it in bed...EDIT 5/29/2019 -- Almost a year now, and we've only experienced a few occasional total freezes. However, it is still as fast, and still as reliable as when I bought it.EDIT 5/6/2021 -- Still going strong. I have installed linux on the machine and even when this drive is used as swap, nothing fails. Still very fast and responsive, and even more so not that I am using Linux as opposed to Windows.EDIT 4/9/2022 -- First failure! Some files mysteriously disappeared from the drive and were unable to be caught bt e2fsck. The drive is still as fast, though.",

                "reviewText": "Now before you go impulsively hit the buy button, there are some caveats. My clients are mostly older, very light computer users. That being said, I mostly sell these and Samsung EVOs and the failure rate of these Inland drives is only slightly higher than that of the EVO. I've installed literally hundreds of these drives and have only had 2-3 come back within the 5 years I've been using them. The write endurance of these drives is higher than most manufacturers and they use the more reliable TLC memory. They're an EXCELLENT value for the money if you're not a heavy computer user.That being said, if you're into video editing, I wouldn't recommend using one of these as a scratch disk / temporary drive. Don't use it in other write intensive applications either. That's not what these drives are designed for. If you're going to be moving files around on a regular basis then know that the performance of these drives is lackluster compared to something like the Samsung EVO. These drives are a HUGE upgrade coming from a hard drive, but they're not meant for people who actually use their computer. There are two types of computer users; those who consume (i.e. watch movies, use social media, browse the internet, etc.) and those who produce (i.e. photo/video editing, music production, CAD design, developer, gaming, storing/organizing large amounts of data, etc.).This is a CONSUMER drive. So long as you use it for its intended purpose, you'll be happy with this drive. If you do more than consume on your computer though, you should really look for something else. I highly recommend the Samsung EVO series for power users and the Samsung PRO series for people who actually create things on their computer. To compare, these Inland drives have a write endurance of 170TBW for the 240GB version. The Samsung EVO 250GB version has a write endurance of 150TBW, but it has DRAM and is significantly faster for power users. The Samsung PRO 250GB version has a write endurance of 600TBW. More expensive computer parts cost more for a reason. You're getting a better quality part that will last longer and perform better. If you're a basic user who just uses their computer to consume, you won't notice a difference between any of these three drives, but if you're a power user and/or creator, then go with the EVO or the PRO. The extra $20 isn't going to break you.",

                "reviewText": "I picked up the 480gb model for ~$60 as that appeared to be a good deal. The first drive I got was basically DOA. It would work for 30 mins to an hour then would freeze. I kept task manager open under Performance task and I noticed that the drive would max out at 100% even when nothing was happening on the computer, no programs open, not doing anything, 100% disk activity for the SSD. So I returned that and purchased a new one and have just installed it.So far the disk appears to be working good. I've only been using it for a couple of hours though so I'll update this review if anything changes. The issue on the drive appeared almost immediately so.. so far so good!As for this disk's performance, I'm not getting 550mb read but I am getting close to 490mb for the write which is cool -- this is for the easiest sequential R/W test. See my own accurate CrystalDisk results above for this drive. The main review on this product seems to have a false report, IMO.I still think it's a good deal if the drive holds up but with this being my second unit I've backed everything up and braced for the worst! I recommend you do the same. QA/QC seems to be a little lacking on these units.",
