                "reviewText": "I recently acquired a ps5 and wanted an extra storage option to suppplement the onboard storage. I did not want to invest a whole lot in this but I wanted something that would be clean looking and get the job done. This SSD fulfills that need.This is to play ps4 gemas on my ps5 so I knew that I would transfer them over to this drive. I wanted decent speeds which this SSD does reach. Keep in mind this is not NVME type speeds more in line with the old SSD drive speeds. The portablility of this drive is a plus because rather than having to connect a cord and lay this device next to the ps5 it just plugs into the back. You will have to format the drive, but once formatted games can be downloaded. The drive does feel flismy and I did get a coople of read errors initially but they have settled since using it for a bit.My favorite part about using this device is that it looks hidden in my setup since it is on the back of the ps5. I will update this review if I have any further problems. My main grip is it just has feel alittle more sturdy and since I did have the inital errors I will monitor if any further issues.",

As an additional driver, it can communicate well with the universal serial bus, and it will be operational soon. I can back up my system completely and have enough storage space. I am not a speed tester, but it seems to copy quickly. This motivation exceeded my expectations. After filling a large number of larger external drives for my photography work, I now store all my new data in it.",

The OS did not recognize the device.I plugged it into my USB3.0 hub with its USB plug and it was recognized and worked, but only at USB2.0 speed, less than .5G/second. Why it didn't work full speed I can't guess. I reformatted it to APFS, rebooted, and tried everything in the book.Everything else I own works find on these ports--but not this gizmo. I don't know if it was defective or what and no longer care.[ After requesting return I found I could get it to work in the thunderbolt port if I turned the USB-C plug upside down! It apparently has a \"top\" and \"bottom\". At that point it worked at USB 2.0 speed only. ]Sent it back.",

They deserve 10 stars.Amazon, if you are listening, can you change this review to 10 stars please?",
