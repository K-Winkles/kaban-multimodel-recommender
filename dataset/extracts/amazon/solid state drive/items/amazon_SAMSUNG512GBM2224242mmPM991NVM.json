I had to scrounge an m2x3 screw from a kit that I have, maybe a little too long and the head is not really wide enough (barely grabs and hold the board) but it's the best I had on hand. Does this seller not know HOW HARD it can be to find the exact size and type of screw needed to mount this type of card inside a laptop?? Or maybe that's the problem, it was too much trouble for the seller to think about. Not to mention the uber-cheap package. Pathetic. The makeshift screw is holding and the drive is working, so far. But I really should've sent it back for a refund.",
