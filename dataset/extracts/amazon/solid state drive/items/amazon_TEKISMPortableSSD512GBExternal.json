It came with a USB-C cable, as well as an adapter for a standard size USB three connection. Also included is a little case that you can put the drive in. My only gripe with the case is that there\u2019s no place to put the cable and the drive is useless without the cable, so it kind of causes a little problem there.The drive was recognized immediately on my computer, and I ran test and confirmed that it had a true 512 gigs of storage. Performance was not quite as advertised, but it worked well enough that I didn\u2019t feel like I was waiting unnecessarily.The indicator light on the side is helpful, but honestly becomes a little annoying if you\u2019re writing and reading because it\u2019s so bright. I just flipped the drive over so that it was not flashing in my face.Temperature wise the drive did heat up with prolonged use, but it didn\u2019t get uncomfortably hot. So far I\u2019ve used it on two separate operating systems without issue and I\u2019ve even used it as a buildable drive and it has worked great.",
