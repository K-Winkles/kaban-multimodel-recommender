                "reviewText": "I honestly didn't need this. But it was giving me serious zip disk nostalgia just looking at it, and the price was right.Things I like:1. It's smaller than I thought it would be. Looked chonkier in the photos.2. Seems very stable. Very sturdy construction.3. Love that i can mount it, should I get a camera that can actually use it.Things I don't like:1. The flimsy rubber dust seal. It can be removed easily. But it should have had an opening like, well, a zip drive... self-retracting and self-sealing. Not something that actually matters - it just would have been so much cooler.2. Doesn't appear to be hot-swappable (on a Mac, at least). You may not realize it, but generally speaking, SATA is hot-swappable - even internal drives. Not in this enclosure, though. You'll need to remove the USB-C cable before plugging in another drive after ejecting. Not a big deal, but also not ideal. I do not know if this is true for cameras as well, but be sure to check if this matters to you!3. Doesn't work with my Samsung 870 QVO 8TB SSD. This is NOT Oyen's fault, though. There's a known bug using QVO SSDs with external enclosures / docks. I was just hoping I'd get lucky with this enclosure. Again, this isn't a knock against Oyen. Samsung needs to release new firmware (currently on SVQ02B6Q).Overall impression:Fast, sturdy, built like a tank (minus that rubber flap), super portable, and camera mountable. Definitely get one!",

Once an SSD is inserted, you're prone to dust and moisture getting inside.The rubber flap is removable via taking out the screw holding it on. I highly recommend doing this, as it would be easy to tear off.If you're doing a lot of indoor shooting, this is perfect, but I'm not using it outside until I can 3D print and mold a silicone cap for the end with a drive inserted.",
