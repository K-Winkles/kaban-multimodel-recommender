Optimized to handle high-end graphics and videos, the X300 Pro hard drive delivers a fast 7200 RPM rotational speed and large cache size to help shorten response time. Toshiba\u2019s cache technology helps optimize cache allocation during read/write cycles to help provide high drive performance in real time. Plus, the X300 Pro\u2019s innovative actuator designs help optimize positioning accuracy and read/write performance for quick access to data. [Note]: (1) One Terabyte (1TB) means 10{12] = 1,000,000,000,000 bytes using powers of 10. Actual formatted storage capacity may vary. For details, please visit Toshiba's Consumer HDD website. (2) Compatibility may vary depending on user\u2019s hardware configuration & operating system. (3) Product specifications, colors, configurations and components are subject to change without notice. (4) \"2.5-inch\" & \"3.5-inch\" mean the form factor of HDDs. They do not indicate drive's physical size. (5) For \"Drive Bays Supported\", please contact your Solutions Provider as compatibility with host device will vary based on the system. (6) Workload is a measure of the data throughput of the year, and it is defined as the amount of data written, read or verified by commands from the host system. (7) MTTF (Mean Time to Failure) is not a guarantee or estimate of product life; it is a statistical value related to mean failure rates for a large number of products which may not accurately reflect actual operation. Actual operating life of the product may be different from the MTTF. (8) Read and write speed may vary depending on the host device, read and write conditions, and file size. (9) Drive life may vary depending on usage and workload. (10) Standard limited warranty terms apply. The warranty brochure can be viewed at Toshiba's Consumer HDD website.",

I mostly just read from it, but I do have some ongoing projects on it as well. Read/Write speeds are quite good, I reckon the 7200 RPM and 512 MB cache help with that. I've only had the drive for a few weeks, so I can't attest to its reliability. If something should happen, I'll update this review.",

So it's first use was dealing with 24 TB of data! And the read/write performance is surprising: I'm getting upwards of 280 MB/s, I'm very surprised... and happy!",

The warranty is not provided by Toshiba itself, but by a third party.

First hard drive I have ever bought (and I have bought hundreds) that did not work out of the box. I mean a lot of people are saying this quits working after a few months or what not, but this one never worked to begin with, just made clicking noises from the very beginning. Not sure how it is even possible that it made it out of the factory. Another reason not to buy, there is no warranty on these because they were sold through a 3rd party, so I did not read the reviews prior to buying but others have mentioned it too, if you go to Toshiba's website and plug in the Serial Number it will tell you its out of warranty. Oh, and its even a hassle to return now, had to wait for days to get a label, and the return address is in Canada. Stay away from this seller, far far AWAY!",

                "reviewText": "Got it for 135 cad on around black friday. 33.75 dollars per tb of 7200 rpm storage .The pro version seemingly provides exactly the same stats except an explaination that its \"built to last\" coupled with I believe a 4 year warranty compared to the 2 year warranty of the original model.The thing is that toshiba makes some of the most reliable drives out there with an average 1 percent annual failure rate average across their drives according to the stats on the cloud storage provider backblaze and is only outclassed by hitachi with a 0.42 annual failure rate.So to have something created for reliability by a company that already makes reliable drives makes a very pleasant combination with enough speed to do anything you want. I'm looking forward to this drive serving me well for years and years.Lastly, even though this drive is \"reliable\" as in way more reliable than others no drive is reliable and you should always back up your data onto low rpm cheap storage.Tldr: Great value for great speed, and insane reliability. Recomended for active storage of programs and games with a small ssd for the operating system.",
