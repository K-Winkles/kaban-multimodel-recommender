Ex: samsung 970 evo, crucicial T700, etc. These are for x4 bus lanesif you are using M.2 cards that run sata protocal and not nvme protocal, this adapter will not work(using b+M key or b key)The item itself:Good quality, fit slot well and locked in without to much or to little resistance.Came w a heat sink and thermal pads (didn't use since not perminant install) but looked like they would do the job just fine.It's thinner than most (doesn't pertrude too far from mobo so doesn't need mounting brackets and saves space in the tool kit.It's passive, so your pc only sees the drive you connect and doesnt need additional drivers (perfect)Would I use it for an every day adapter, yeah, it seems pretty stout.",

It works great, and I like the fact that I don't need to remove a case knockout to use it. Might get another to add an extra storage drive to my computer rathern than having extra cables running all over.Also thinking about using one to get NVME drive into an older pre M.2 computer. With a thumb drive and some bootloader trickery I might be able to breathe some life into an older system. Be fun to try anyway.",
