The A55 offers improved endurance and longer battery life that you're able to work longer without frequently recharge your laptop. High Transfer Speeds for Fast Start Up Powered by high quality controller and original synchronous NAND flash, the A55 delivers incredibly high transfer speeds that enable short boot time, fast application loading and quick file processing. SLC Cache Technology for Performance Boost and Longer Lifespan The A55 especially applies the \u201dSLC Cache technology\u201d that allows all data to be written in the SLC portion first and leads to higher peak writing performance. In addition, the technology can reduce write amplification and thus offer better endurance and longer lifespan of the SSD. Free-download SSD Health Monitor Tool - SP Toolbox Software The A55 comes with a free-download SSD health monitor tool - SP Toolbox Software, which is especially designed for you to easily monitor the current health status of a SSD. By such, you can run a performance test, get an overall health evaluation and check detailed information about your SSD, including used space on device, device temperature, total bytes written, S.M.A.R.T. status, erase count status and block numbers. *Please download the software at SP Official Website. Absolutely Reliable with Bad Block Management The A55 is built with Bad Block Management, which can continually monitor and replace bad blocks to keep your system in good condition with prolonged lifespan of a SSD. Multiple Techniques Supported The A55 is one of the lightest and thinnest SSD of its kind yet it is shock- and vibration-proof since it contains no moving parts. Furthermore, S.M.A.R.T. monitoring system and ECC technology are equipped to promise higher data transmission safety.",

                "reviewText": "My wife discovered one of our kid's old ASUS Q200e laptop sitting in a drawer. While it had been updated from Windows 8 (the last Vista/Me Microsoft unleashed) to WIN 10 it ran quite slow. Having recently been gathering old boxes around the house and repurposing them for narrow tasks, I thought I'd try an SSD in the ASUS. It had a 500 GB spinner originally and I had no real need for more room so I saved the $30 and got another 500 instead of a 1 TB. It got delivered quickly and is working well; not much else to say. The box will work fine for traveling and watching movies and listening to music. This way I don't have to worry too much about it and my better laptop stays safe at home.",

We were ready to throw this laptop against the wall until this SSD was installed. Now, Windows updates run in a reasonable amount of time and overall system performance is very good. For the price, we couldn't be happier! Installation was very easy and Windows 11 didn't have any issues with the SSD at all.",

TBW (total terabytes written before drive goes bad) for this drive is good at this price range i.e 250 TBW.5. The drive is made of metal and good quality plastic and feels sturdy but is still lightweight.Crucial drives are also of the same price range and Crucial's quality is also good but TBW is significantly less for BX500 for 512 GB drive i.e 120 TBW. Even Crucial MX500 at a higher price range gives 180 TBW for 512 GB drive.Recommended purchase.",
