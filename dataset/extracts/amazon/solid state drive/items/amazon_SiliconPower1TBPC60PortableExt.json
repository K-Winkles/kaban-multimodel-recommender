        "description": "Square In Shape, But Not So Square In Design At just 80mm square, the PC60 is one of our most portable-friendly portable SSDs yet. It fits snugly in the palm of a hand and comfortably slides into a pocket, unnoticed, thanks to its slim 11mm profile. The polished frame accentuates its square shape, while the unique ripple design symbollically conveys memories like ripples, momentary fluctuations in life that are recorded on to this device. This Portable SSD Was Made For Walkin' The PC60's shock-resistant design can withstand minor drops and bumps. The convenient keyhole design allows it to easily attach to keychains or bags. These features complement its intent to be an on-the-go back-up storage solution. USB 3.2 Gen 2: The Pace That Keeps Up With You With its USB 3.2 Gen 2 interface, the PC60 can transfer data at lightning speeds, up to 10Gbps, while its Type-C port is both convenient and on-trend with the majority of new devices. Blazing read and write speeds up to 540MB/s and 500MB/s, respectively, get the job done faster \u2013 perfect for on-the-go tasks. More Space Than Meets The Eye Despite its ultra compact size, the PC60 contains massive storage space. 3D NAND Flash technology allows it to store a deceptively large amount of data, up to 4TB. At averages of 4MB per song or 6MB per photo, that's enough space for up to 480,000 songs or 320,000 photos.",

                "reviewText": "I admit I was a bit skeptical at first but after using dd to write to the drive first I zeroed the drive before using it and it does slow down after 1.8TB of zeroing non-stop to the drive but it does work fairly fast as advertised. This is not a scam drive, the space is there. This is a good drive for the price, its a good backup drive for your drive images. I would buy again and may do that, hopefully they make a 8TB version. From a drive recovery perspective, this drive is good because its SATA in a aluminum case and you can take it out if the USB becomes faulty. Overall the drive can be mounted, taken out of the case and put into a docking station for cloning or imaging. So even though its larger than most drives the 2.5 inch SATA legacy form factor is the perfect size for storing in a safe location. I will buy again in the future as it has a small enough form factor. Sure its not waterproof like other rugged drives but its good for backups, if you can wait a bit longer to copy. SATA is a more rugged versatile hardware configuration in my opinion but its slower but more versatile and durable and is not prone to damage like NVME. So Silicon Power is one of the best drives made in Taiwan, I do recommend it for backups.",

                "reviewText": "SP Bolt B75 ProI bought this in October 2022, but decided not to write a review until I have used it for sometime and now is the right time to do the needful.Shipping was extremely fast and the drive arrived in a couple of days to my address in Covin. Packaging was intact and undamaged. The drive itself was packed in a clear plastic enclosure which contained the USB cables and the instructions manual. This was in turn packed in a cardboard box making the packaging attractive and safe.The size of the device is somewhat akin to a smart phone, slightly shorter in length, but wider and thicker than my \u201cGalaxy S23 Ultra\u201d cell phone. It weighed less than the phone and could be carried in my trouser pocket without any issue. The casing is metal, probably aluminum and is slate black in colour and the build quality is surprisingly good and does not look cheap or fragile.There were two USB cables, one type-C to type-C and the other type-C to USB. These are also of very good quality and fits snuggly into the corresponding ports in the drive as well as the computer.The capacity is as suggested (2TB in my case) and the data transfer rates are quick. I used mine to store music and movies and in the six months of usage did not have any issues such as data loss or getting stuck.All in all I can say that this drive is of very good quality and can be considered akin to more expensive and well known brands although very reasonably priced. Bought a second unit in August 2023",

This one is hard quality and it is NICE (even nice to look at). I wish they'd offer this case separately, as a SATA SSD Enclosure, I buy a box full.Heat Dissipation is excellent and performance is as claimed. No, this does not have the fastest read / write specs, if you're looking for blazing speeds or gaming, spend a hundred dollars more & buy something else. For routine file backup though, it's fast enough. Crystal Disk test showed it to be slightly above the stated speeds. I'm using this for non-critical, routine backup of video and music files, the 2TB version was less than 90 bucks WOW.After my experience with this, I bought a second one, this time the 4TB version. For what you pay and what you get, this drive and deal is Outstanding!...",

                "reviewText": "I am copying files from an older Seagate external harddrive to my Surface Go laptop and then to the Bolt75 external harddrive. The speed is very good. It takes few minutes to copy and paste 35GB in the process. No problems so far adding 300 GB to the Bolt75. My Surface Go is the hold-up with time and space. I was hoping everything be OK and it is. First I could not copy. I changed the format and everything works fine. I have Samsung S23 Ultra, Windows Surface Go (1st generation?). I formatted Bolt75 using my Surface Go.I have decades of files processing. Seems as if so far it does exactly as I hoped for.So far \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc. My old Seagate is only 320 GB and just a lil bit smaller in physical size and heavier - it still.woeks fine. The Bolt75 is capable to deal with the newest plug types but, not sure about all available file extensions. Haven't tried it on my Samsung tv yet. The Bolt75 is much much faster than my 7 or, 8 year old 2.0/3.? usb Seagate external hard drive.I would try this product.Remember that stuff today feels lighter in weight and seems flimsy in comparison. However, this Bolt75 is only a storage facility and not see much action. For the money - so far, so \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc.",
