                "reviewText": "I purchased several of these drives - some in 1TB and one in 2TB. These are extremely easy to install and a quick set up in Disk Management and the drives perform perfectly. Are they the fastest there is? No, but they are much faster than HDD or typical SSD. My boot up times are extremely fast. I was able to easily clone my OS onto the new drive and it has been working flawlessly. I am using the 2TB version for my gaming PC to store games which has worked out really well as the games load super fast. For the gaming PC I am using a heatsink given that the drive is used much more heavily.",

Not fast enough for a main drive in my opinion, the WD black is a better choice if you\u2019re looking for a drive for your OS. Still seeing speeds up to 500mb/s peak and 200mb/s sustained, which isn\u2019t bad for real world numbers. Gets a bit warm under extended use, but I haven\u2019t noticed any thermal throttling using a heat pad and small heat sink.",

The fact that this holds 1000x more than that and only costs 13% of what I paid is amazing.Drive came well packaged and was easy to install. Good value for the money and helped refurbish an old laptop.",

                "reviewText": "I use this for an external enclosure that caps out around 1200 mbps sequential read over USB 3.2. Thats twice as fast as an internal SATA SSD but nowhere near the capability of PCIE 4 M.2 drives. This was cheap and had solid capacity and runs my external enclosure at around 800 mbps sequential read, more or less capping it out. I've had no issues with load times on this drive as of yet.I'm docking this a star because it is a gen 3 drive, and it won't be able to utilize the full bandwidth of a gen 4 slot if that is what you are aiming for. This is definitely a slower drive then some other m.2 drives, but for my use case it is more then siffucient.",

The Acronis failed to clone the old drive first try this time, but I just backed up my files to external storage and made a recovery 8GB Usb drive created with the Windows 11 OS, and put the files back afterwards, no problem. I've never had a problem with WD drives and until now the free Acronis has cloned my old drives first try, but this method does have the advantage of being a fresh start on the OS, so don't avoid WD because of that.",
