It even has DDR3 memory!I decided to try making it useful on the cheap, so I bought this 1TB drive. The results are more than worth it.CrystalDiskMark has it as 10 times as fast as my old hard drive.The difference is amazing.It went from \"Hit power button, go make cup of coffee, come back and log in\" to \"Hit power button, *blip* Log in\".Every program loads faster, as well.So now it's been dusted and cleaned up and sits on my desk again, ready for daily use. I'm going to add more RAM, and will probably buy a larger FikWot drive for it, maybe a 2TB this time.Also, the SATA connector is pretty solid and doesn't flex like that expensive Crucial SSD did before it broke.Don't know how long it will last, but it's already lasted longer than that Crucial did.",

                "reviewText": "When looking to upgrade an old Lenovo Ideapad with a built-in 32GB storage it required an older technology M.2. The M/.2 would not accept the current NVME so I chose this and the 1TB NAND / NGFF fir perfectly and allowed me to replace the onboard storage with this as the primary device. I was unable to add this as a logical extension to the existing HDD, but that's a lenovo fault for soldering memory to the board instead of making it modular.With this unit installed, we are now able to boot from a 1 TB drive and able to install Windows updates that were required simply to operate the machine. by using this NAND M.2, it is breathing new life into a machine that had become unusable and out of the most basic storage capabilities.BOTTOM LINE: If you need an older NGFF to upgrade an older laptop - this has proven to be a great solution.Reviewed:Fikwot FN203 1TB M.2 SATA SSD - SLC Cache 3D NAND TLC SATA III 6Gb/s M.2 2280 NGFF Internal Solid State Drive, Up to 550MB/s, Compatible with Ultrabooks, Tablet Computers and Mini PCs",
