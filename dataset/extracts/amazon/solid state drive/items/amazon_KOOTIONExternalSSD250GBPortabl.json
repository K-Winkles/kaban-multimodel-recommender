                "reviewText": "I wasn't really expecting much from this. Vendors always overhype their product. I figured it'd just be another flash drive, to transfer pictures and stuff around.I was wrong.I friend called and asked for some help doing some things on my local VMs. Sometimes I do things like that. I didn't really want them working on the good running VM, so I cloned. I thought, \"this will be a good test of the drive\". It wasn't terribly important that it was fast, and if the drive died, we'd just redo it.The clone time was 1/4 of the clone time on the HDD. I assumed I just remembered wrong.I decided to start up both VMs at the same time. While the original on the HDD was starting, the clone on the SSD had already started, and I logged in, put TeamViewer on, set the credentials, and emailed them off. The one on the HDD was still booting.So I had to measure it. These aren't really clean measurements. The normal Windows stuff is running on C:, my internal NVMe M.2 storage.D: is this USB SSD in this listing, and the VM was still running.G: is my bulk storage for games and VMs. The original VM was still running from there.As you can see, the actual measurements are way better than the advertised claims. I'm guessing when they benchmarked them, they used a slower USB port, or maybe just on a slower machine. My machine is a nice new(ish) Asus RoG machine.In summary, get this. It may speed up your slow old machine. Boot from it, or install games to it, you'll likely appreciate the increased performance.I did open it up to see what's inside. It's a nice little MSATA to USB adapter, and the MSATA SSD. If/when this SSD goes, because all electronics eventually go, you can swap another MSATA SSD into it's place. There are adhesive covers on each end, with two screws under each.",

                "reviewText": "I don't know if you can purchase a jump/thumb drive to 60 GB, but I'm thinking you can't unless you spend a ton of money. This little SSD external drive is amazingly small and light-weight and for an extra 60 GB of space, a very reasonable price. I have both a larger laptop, a small and very portable laptop (to use with my portable keyboard) and a tablet that I can also use with my portable keyboard. Having this SSD drive with 60 GB is so helpful as both my portable laptop and tablet have very limited space to save stuff. I am not a fan of clouds as most cost money to maintain a certain amount of space and because it is a cloud, it can become vulnerable to hacking. Call me paranoid, but I would rather have my stuff with me. I have a large 3 terrabyte external hard drive to save my stuff on at the house. This little portable one can go with me when I am out and about. What would I do without my electronics?!? :)",

                "reviewText": "Summary: I have recently started upgrading to USB-C and USB 3.1, so I wanted to try this drive to see if the speeds were faster. The advertised speeds are: 350MB/s Read and 200 MB/s Write. I am comparing this to a SEKC 256GB 3.1 thumb drive.Details: Main desktop computer is a Dell XPS 8920. System drive is a 250GB SSD. Two other HDDs for data, 1.0TB and 6.0TB. External USB connections are: USB-C 3.1 (rear), USB-A 3.1 (rear), USB-A 3.0 (front). THe transfer speed difference between the front (3.0) and back (3.1) was negligible.Test Method: The test program I use is ATTO Disk Benchmark (freeware). I tried a few different ones, and settled on this one because the result picture was relatively easy to compare to other results. When evaluating results, I mainly looked at the transfer speeds for files size 1 MB or larger.Observations: Between the front (3.0) and back (3.1) ports, I saw slightly better Write speeds (255 vs. 295 MB/s) on the back port (expected). Read was 440 MB/s on both ports.Recommendation: Get a good freeware speed test program.Pros: Good fit & finish; speeds as advertised; blue activity indicator led.Cons: None.Conclusion: Going to use this instead of my USB stick drives, since the size is pretty close, and transfer speeds are 2 times, and the write speeds are 4-5 times faster.Related Products:SEKC 256GB USB 3.1 Flash Drive - SDA20256Ghttps://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07PM9D3T7",
