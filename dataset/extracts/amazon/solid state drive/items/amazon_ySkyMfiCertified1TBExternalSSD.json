                "reviewText": "This external hard drive does a good job of covering all the bases. It has ports for USB C and USB A for data transfer, as well as a micro USB port for power. I'm honestly not sure what the need for external power is for; after all this is a SSD, not spinning disk, so it's power requirements are minimal. I used this attached to my PC via USB C and no power, without issue. Maybe it is necessary for use with mobile? There are a ton of instructions, mostly having to do with using this with an Apple device. I don't have those, so cannot comment on its utility when it comes to that. For me, I am using this as a simple external hard drive, but love the fact it is solid state. No moving parts usually means much longer life. This is limited to exfat formatting, which is a bit of a downer. It says so in multiple locations, even on the drive itself. I guess it will give issues if formatted differently. Either way, this is a good pickup for what it does. I would imagine it works even better for Apple, as that is what it's marketed for and there are tons of instructions on how to integrate it into that ecosystem. Either way I like this drive!",

                "reviewText": "This thing looks like an old makeup compact. I say old because it was covered in fingerprints and scratches right out of the box. It looks like the last part of QA at the factory is handled by toddlers eating Cheetos.I went to test this and I noticed some odd things. First, my CrystalDiskMark had an anime girl on it, and second, this was only giving me USB 2.0 speeds. It's connected to a Thunderbolt 4 compatible USB-C port via what should have been a Thunderbolt 4 cable. It sure looked like the right cable, until I looked at the plug end and noticed it said 240w. That's not my Thunderbolt 4 cable. Hmm...anime girl...yep. My daughter stole my cable. So, if you get USB 2.0 (40MB/s) speed out of this, blame my daughter. Or your USB-C cable. One of the two. Remember, there are lots of USB-C cables out there that are USB 2.0. Those are typically charging cables. They may say 480Mbps somewhere on the packaging or on the listing. That's USB 2.0. Real world, it'll be 40MB/s....ish.After I recovered my good cable from my daughter's room (why she stole my Thunderbolt 4 cable to charge her phone, I'll never know) I set about testing this. The numbers aren't terrible. They aren't amazing, but they aren't terrible.This thing whines. I have no idea what's whining in there, but it's quite high pitched. I can hear it, but not as well as the kids in the house, who all heard it from across the room. I am become old, destroyer of La-Z-Boys.It gets pretty warm. It's not blazing hot, but it is warm when in use. Also, it's not super portable, considering you need to plug it into your device and into power. It doesn't have any kind of power pass through. Meaning, it won't charge your phone.I tested this on Windows 10 and Android 13. It worked just fine on both. I didn't have to do a thing to it on either. I just plugged it in and both immediately recognized it. I don't use Apple products. I have literally never owned anything made by Apple and I never will.It seems to be getting quieter with use. No idea why this thing was whining out of the box. Maybe it was angry about the greasy fingerprints from the factory.",

I simply hooked it up to my Windows Laptop with the included USB cable and I was up and running. I could not do the same with my Android table and phone. Also, I could not evaluate the in or out transfer rates on the device. I can only evaluate it as a non-techy reviewer. The size and weight of this device is a huge selling point for me.
