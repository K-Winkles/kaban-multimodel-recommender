                "reviewText": "Embarking on numerous SSD upgrades, my journey with TeamGroup has been nothing short of exceptional. From enhancing the performance of budget laptops to optimizing my wife's PS4, TeamGroup's EX2 2TB 3D NAND TLC SSD has proven to be a versatile and affordable solution. Serving as an efficient boot drive, I reserve the faster NVMe counterparts for gaming.In the realm of SSDs, TeamGroup stands out as the epitome of reliability and affordability. Having explored alternatives, I found that other brands often fell short, succumbing to premature failures or pricing themselves out of practicality. TeamGroup, however, strikes the perfect equilibrium between cost-effectiveness and premium quality.Choosing TeamGroup is not just a purchase; it's a commitment to consistent satisfaction and peace of mind. Their products have never failed to meet, and often exceed, my expectations. TeamGroup remains my go-to choice for SSDs, embodying the essence of affordability without compromising on the paramount factor of quality. A decision to trust TeamGroup is, unequivocally, a wise investment in both performance and value.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this 2tb SATA III internal SSD for $72. Amazing value. I was a little worried that the performance would be poor but I am getting sustained writes just below 500MB/s and sustained reads just over 500MB/s. Very, very large writes eventually slow down but I was able to get decent speeds even when writing 500gb consisting of several hundred thousand of files for a big backup task \u2013 took about 30 minutes or an average of half the smaller sustained write speed which isn't spectacular but perfectly fine. And completely expected. Reads never slow down, it's only writes that eventually get slower. In normal operation where you are writing only small amounts to the drive at any one time even if you're reading very large amounts, you will never see the speeds drop below about 500MB/s.This is a great archive, backup, and general storage drive. It can't compete with really fast modern SSDs with faster interfaces but the performance is right in line with other inexpensive SSDs using a SATA III interface. Most of those other inexpensive SSDs are more expensive than this one, sometimes a lot more expensive. I have it in a USB 3 gen1 enclosure and I can boot my computer with it just fine. It's certainly not the best boot drive but you'd pay quite a bit more for a better boot drive let alone a \"best\" one.Just got it today so I can't speak about longevity. The TBW specified by the manufacturer for the 2tb version which I got is pretty good. I don't plan to ever fill it up more than just a bit past halfway and it's for incremental backups so after today the writes will be pretty small and therefore I expect it will last me for as long as I care to keep it in service.",
