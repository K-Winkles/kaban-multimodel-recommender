You can use \"Disk Management Tool\" to format and partition the SSD, and then use it in \"Windows Explorer\". Why is the actual capacity of SSD smaller than the advertised capacity? Because the manufacturer's calculation method is 1TB=1000MB=1000000KB=1000000000B, and the computer system's calculation method is 1TB=1024MB=1024*1024KB=1024*1024*1024B, so the capacity you see is 1TB=(1000*1000*1000)/(1024*1024*1024)TB\u22480.93TB. How to copy data to a new SSD? We have launched the latest FANXIANG SSD Toolbox, which can read the running status of SSDs. At the same time, it also has disk cloning and system migration functions (Note: this operation will delete all data on the target hard drive). What does the product packaging contain? \"After purchasing the product you will receive: 1 * 2.5-inch SATA SSD, 1 * product box Note: The product does not include a SATA cable. If needed, please purchase separately. Thank you.\" How can I know if this product is compatible with my computer? For a 2.5\" SATA SSD, as long as your computer has a SATA interface or previously used either a mechanical hard drive or a solid-state drive, you can use this SSD",

                "reviewText": "This HD is less expensive, and for that reason I felt nervous purchasing it. After arrival, I plug it into a Video Recorder and it formats and records OK. Sigh of relief.HOWEVER, I attach it to my computer via a Sabrent USB 3.1 2.5\" SSD Cable Adapter - EC-SS31 purchased elsewhere, and the computer did NOT FULLY RECOGNIZE IT. Additionally, I can't initialize via MMC in Windows 11 because a terse error appears leaving me hanging. When I check the Windows systray, it shows the device for detaching but does not assign a drive letter. So I boot into Ubuntu 22.04 Linux and similar issue. GParted does not even recognize the drive. Attaching the drive to the computer is critical for transferring files from the Video Recorder so that I can edit them on the computer.Luckily I also have a Wavlink USB 3 2.5\" HD case. Trying the drive with this will possibly eliminate any issue with the Sabrent adapter.The drive immediately is recognized with the Wavlink, fully initialized, formatted and pops up in the operating system and transfers files.Just because the device is inexpensive does not mean it is no good. If possible, properly check and eliminate all other variables before calling support or returning.",

I dropped in a Samsung EVO drive into the slot and benchmarked with Win11 internal app \"winsat disk\", and happiness with a 25% drive full and 250GB test file. When the FanXiang S102 Pro SATA III was dropped in, it tested to be 18% faster writing, same read, than the Samsung EVO, the Samsung supposed to be the fastest drive sold. BUT the FanXiang S102 Pro tested to be faster and is less than half the price. Given limited testing only 0.25TB file an 25% full. Didn't find the ability to to hardware encrypt but don't care as I use software OS encryption. It's used to store Virtual OS and containers and years of network log files so it doesn't get used a lot. The FanXiang S102 uses SLC as core and cache and some 25% TLC as long term store and Samsung uses DRAM as cache and TLC for store. Understand why Samsung runs hotter but it also should be faster but is not. Buy the 102 Pro over the 101 because it is just slightly more expensive but faster than the best rated Samsung in my application. I'm a silicon design engineer and fascinated by design choices. I really like the FanXiang S102 Pro design implementation. Save money and buy this design. Sometimes good designs need to be rewarded even if they come from a smaller company.",
