                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Dont let 5000 MB/s fool you this drive is great for a few reasons",
                "reviewText": "First, PCI-E gen 4 and 5 support in one drive mean it can do the same speed in 2 5.0 lanes as it does in 4 4.0 lanes, meaning as we go forward to newer CPUs and chipsets, this type of drive will transition well and use less resources to do it.The 5000 MB/s seems low given 10K+ drives exist, but that's the Sequential read speed, rated using ideal conditions. The GREAT majority of stuff we actually DO with computers uses far more Random Access, and those numbers are much lower pretty much across the board. This drive is in the top 3 fastest, hitting over 5000 MB/s in RANDOM reads.The practical upshot of this is - if you are moving a lot of big files, this drive will be fairly average and get toasted by the fastest drives out there, no question. It wont be SLOW, but it wont be able to move stuff around your PS5 at 7GB/s either.On the other hand, this will feel like the snappiest drive ever for an OS/data/programs drive. The random read and Overall System numbers in PC Mark are in the top 5 of all consumer M.2 drives out today, in the top 3 for pure random reads. This metric has traditionally been played down if its mentioned at all, because it is SO much lower than the Sequential Read numbers, but it is probably a far better indicator of how a system will \"feel\" when using the drive for actual work/play/GPs, and this one is extremely good at this.I have run the PC Mark suite a few times each on Intel 460, 570, and 790, with the 790 using PCI-E 5.0x2, with extremely consistent results.Easily the best system/general data drive for the price, and its not even a question at this point.

                "reviewText": "I ordered this for my PS5, I wasn't sure it was going to work well because it doesn't have DRAM therefore it won't be able to take advantage of the gen 5 capabilities without the PS5 being able to use HMB like PC's otherwise would. But to my surprise once it was installed in the PS5, it identified and formatted the drive with zero issues.The only issue is that it doesn't have a heatsink, and therefore suffered from some throttling, this is just a small storage drive, and won't be played on too much, so I'm fine without having a heatsink for now, but will order one shortly.I was able to transfer the New COD Modern Warfare III's massive 177GBs to the new drive in about 65 seconds. And it did throttle towards the end of the transfer, but not by a lot. I also played the game for about an hour after the install, and suffered no performance loss, nor was I able to detect any sort of stuttering.This isn't the fastest m.2 out there but it is very efficient, and affordable. I see a lot of pre-built PC's coming stock with this, which is nice because normal stock capacity of pre-built m.2's range from 256-500gb, and the 990 EVO's lowest capacity is 1tb.I would recommend this for the OS on mini pc's and other compatible consoles for storage.I genuinely like this hard drive and think it's going to have staying power in the PC market for awhile.",

                "reviewText": "... but wait, it's advertised as a PCIe gen 5.0 NVME. It sadly sticks to Gen 4.0 speeds so it's not much better than what you'd get with mid-range PCIe Gen 4.0 NVMEs. If I were you, I would spend the money towards a high-end Gen 4.0 NVME until Gen 5.0 matures and gets us closer to the theoretical, 14,000MB/s speeds.That said, if your purposes is purely gaming, then I'd save even more money and stick to Gen 3.0 and higher capacities. You can get a 4TB Gen 3 for about 200 bucks. Sometimes you can find a 2TB Gen 4.0 for around $110. The WD SN770 is currently 107 (3 Feb 2024) and performs slightly better.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this drive to add to my gaming desktop computer. I wanted both extra storage and faster speeds over my current Samsung 970 EVO drive. I didn't think I'd notice much of a difference, but I did. I only use this drive for my Steam Library and specifically for Starfield. There is a lot of loading in this game, so having a dedicated drive made a difference. The game loads several seconds faster then when it was on my 970 EVO, and that includes the in-game loading too. I'm able to move large files between the two drives at lightning speeds. Overall this drive performs very well. I'm getting Performance Benchmarks on Sequential Read of 3216 MB/s, Sequential Write of 2616 MB/s, Random Read 257567 IOPS, Random Write 196044 IOPS. Compared to my older 970 EVO which was Sequential Read 3060 MB/s, Sequential Write 1926 MB/s, Random Read 246582 IOPS, and 187988 IOPS. Overall, I'm super happy with this drive and it comes from a major name brand that I can trust for my data storage. Great job Samsung!",

I\u2019ve been using a 980 Evo in a similar scenario for a couple years now and I expect this one to perform just as well in the new/secondary system I just built with it.In terms of longevity, we will see, but Samsung SSDs are among the best. My aforementioned 980 hasn\u2019t even shown 1% degradation after all this time being used as a game drive in my primary system.",
