                "reviewText": "This thing is amazing in the Steamdeck. Installation is about as easy as it can get and it speeds it up drastically compared to the 64gb emmc. Just a heads up though.. If you have a somewhat newer Steamdeck, your buttons and triggers will not work during the reinstallation of the os. The only thing that works is the touch screen. But, once you update the os, all of your buttons will work again. It was a sketchy 10 minutes or so after I put the thing back together and the buttons didn't work. So I wanted to give you all a heads up. I got this for $12.50 for the 256gb mainly to speed up boot times. It's probably the best $12.50 I ever spent and I'll probably upgrade to a bigger one when the prices come down a bit.",

It's cheaper to just put in a new drive, image it, and get the laptop up and running than it is to wipe a drive, re-image it, etc.One big factor in choosing these SK Hynix drives is that these are the same ones that ship with DELL Latitude laptops.

                "reviewText": "Bought a 64gb Steamdeck. Got this for under $30. Only took about 30 minutes to install and then just reloaded the Steam OS. \"Deck Ready\" on YouTube has a great tutorial on his channel. Just be aware that all of your game saves are on your original drive, and if you don't want to lose them clone your old drive first. You'll need an M2 drive enclosure if you decide to go that route. If you're not worried about those than this, a small Phillips screwdriver, and a guitar pic are all you'll need to do the upgrade. My Steamdeck runs and loads way faster now with this drive in.",

                "reviewText": "$30 for 256GB NVMe is good value. No idea if these were be pulled from other systems but they're new enough for me. HWiNFO showed <90 power cycles. Can't remember how many GB were written but it was little enough to not concern me. A full format found no bad sectors. Note the sequential performance in my screenshot is limited by the USB bus and this will definitely perform better when installed directly on the mainboard. Performance is as expected for USB 3.2 gen2. Very happy for the price",
