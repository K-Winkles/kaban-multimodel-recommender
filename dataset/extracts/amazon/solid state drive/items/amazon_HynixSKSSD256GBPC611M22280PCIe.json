So all of this is fine.However I could not recommend this drive for gaming. These drives I bought are going in work PCs. The speed is adequate, even impressive, for an inexpensive drive. But these things all run HOT if you copy any decent sized volume of files!!! As in you will leave skin behind if you touch the controller chip. I had to buy additional heat sinks so I would feel more comfortable. At first I thought something was wrong but I loaded two more with the same results.So far I haven\u2019t had any failures or problems but if I could turn back time I\u2019d buy a few different types to test.",
