                "reviewText": "Bought for a PS5, 4TBtl;dr troubling read speed @ 5,900 MB/s, durable & decent design, easy installINSTALL***Install was very easy.. getting the PS5 cover off is a sinch, watch a video if you've never done it.The drive does not come with any spacers or screws, but lucky enough the PS5 comes with an M.2 spacer and screw pre installed. They're inside the M.2 housing compartment, at the top. Unscrew and remove, set aside. Plug in the drive, and secure it using Sony's spacer and screw. The spacer is used to fill the gap between the M.2 drive and the console, and the screw holds it all to the console. It's simple and self explanatory once you get in there.SPEED***The PS5 formats the drive once you turn it on, and runs a read/write test. Mine came back as 5,900 MB/s read.. not even close to the 7,200 MB/s it advertises... I expected better.. but for the 4TB storage, I guess it's alright. I'm really not sure how I feel about this, yet. I've only tested one game since installation, Genshin Impact, and I couldn't tell a difference from the internal storage. Although I only started the game, I did not run around or teleport or engage in any combat. Genshin has a fairly heavy startup, so I figured this would be a good test, and it seemed okay.. but still, 5,900 MB/s is what the console says the read speed is at.STORAGE***After formatting, the drive displayed 4.09TB available in the sotrage settings. This was impressive and pleasing. I've already installed many games. It's great to have the space to install all your favorites and work-in-progress platinum trophy titles, without having the juggle the very limited 1TB of internal storage.. which is really only aoout 600GB after saves and media.. you're lucky to get 7 full AAA games installed on the internal storage, so this 4TB is a real game changer.CONCLUSION***Good purchase, could be falsely advertised read speed.. I don't want to remove it from the console to run more tests so I'll just leave it as is. All in all I'm happy with the buy and product, but wish the read speed was advertised honestly, as this thought will probably irritate me for quite some time, until I run many heavy load games and determine it's speed through natural perception.",

                "reviewText": "I briefly measured the speeds with CrystalDisk and they appear to be as advertised. Great value at this time for an increasingly competitive space for 4TB SSDs.The main issue that comes up when researching this SSD is the controller. There was a report of Innogrit controller failures over a year ago, and that gave enough reason for people to avoid any product with controllers made by Innogrit. Given the amount of time since those reports, I suspect Innogrit has resolved those catastrophic issues. If I encounter a failure, I will update this review.",

It is as many other buyers have stated, the speed of this ssd is not as stated on the packaging. It is roughly 5500mb per sec. Still, wasn't enough to deter me from the price and the performance wasn't too bad. For now, I'd highly recommend getting it when it is on a sale of some sort.",
