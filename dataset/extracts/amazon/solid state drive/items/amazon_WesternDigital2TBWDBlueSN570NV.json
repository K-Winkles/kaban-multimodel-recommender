                "reviewText": "Installed these in a Mac Mini and a MacBook Air. Installed and reformatted for MacOS, been cranking along for months no issues.As a typical Mac user, these drives are way faster than Mac OWM drives. Transfer large and many, many small files without a hitch.Sorry not a big numbers guy. Just is it; working well, no issues better than what I had before in my everyday working environment? For me the answer is yes.I move rather large (240gb to 700gb) files around more than I like, and they chug a long quite nicely.I also move a few to hundreds of smaller files around as well. Again not blazing, but waaaay better than what I had before.When I bought these I was trying to balance price, speed and reliability. And I feel I accomplished that.When the spirit moves me, and I upgrade to a system that supports a way, way faster drive I will upgrade. As it stands, the next Mac I get will still be able to use these drives and maybe, just maybe exceed their capabilities. But probably not.So I have a few years of very nice speeds and most in my pocket. Sounds like a win to me.",

                "reviewText": "I upgraded my Mac Mini (late 2014 model) including a new PNY 1TB SSD hard drive and this NVMe. The NVMe requires an adapter, which I purchased on Amazon as well. (Sintech M.2 NGFF NVMe SSD Card for Upgrade Mac Mini Late 2014 Year A1347 MEG Series). You will need a #6 and #8 Torx SECURITY screwdrivers to get into the Mac mini and to install the new parts. I had a Torx set, but they weren't \"security\" so I had to make a dash to the store before they closed so I could use the computer the next day.The NVMe fit perfectly into the adapter with one provided screw. The adapter was easy to slid inside the computer and snap the wires to the computer. My son-in-law recommended this set up for me and I'm so glad he did. My computer was dying and was taking forever to just turn a page or open an email. It was like dial-up if you're old enough to remember that. My computer is faster than it was when I first got it. I'm really happy with the upgraded guts and am proud of my 70 year old self for tackling this job and getting it right. The hardest part for me was reattaching the fan connection. IT IS a TINY snap on connector. found out after the install and update that Monterey is the last OS upgrade that my late 2014 Mac Mini will accept, even with the new hardware. I think that'll be fine for a couple years as long as Lightroom doesn't require newer than that before then. Hopefully I can save up for a new computer. This is a good \"tide me over fix\". Good luck with your own upgrade.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:Fast performance: Significant speed improvements over SATA SSDs and older NVMe drives.Affordable: SN570 is a good value for the price.Low power consumption: This is particularly beneficial for laptops and small form factor PCs. I was able to reduce my TrueNas power consumption by moving apps/ixSystem to this drive.Easy installation: Installation process to be straightforward. Just plug and play.WD Dashboard software is helpful for monitoring drive health and firmware updates. I have used only on Windows.Acronis True Image: You can clone your older drive using Acronis True Image for Western Digital. It's a free cloning software. Once cloning is complete, remove your older drive and plug in your new SN570 drive. All your licenses, softwares, bookmarks are right there in your system. Used only on windows.Cons:WD Dashboard software: Screen could go blank or white sometimes appearing to be stuck.Cloning software: There could be errors if other softwares are running during cloning. You might have to do it couple of times.Compatibility: Might have compatibility issues with certain systems. Please check your MoBo/system specs.Write speed drops: when transferring large amounts of data, you may notice a significant drop in write speeds due to limited cache size. I have used on my desktop and NAS which has 40TB of data and a total of 80(copy on both).Heat sink: heat sink is a must if living in a hot region. Generally, it runs around 40s.Wish list:Users should able to check the compatibility of the SN570 with their system before purchasing using some WD software.If you plan on transferring large amounts of data, you may want to consider a different SSD. I personally have Samsung and WD both.A heat sink may be necessary to prevent the SSD from overheating.Overall, the WD Blue SN570 is a good value for the price and offers excellent performance for an average user. However, you might want to consider compatibility and limitations with the WD Dashboard software.",
