If your IOS device is with a lightning port, It is not compatible with our SD301. If your IOS device is with type C port, our SD301 can compatible with it well directly. You can first connect the C port of your phone, find and open the \"Files\" App, and then click \"Browse\", \"SSK SD301\" will appear so that you can start to use it. Is it normal for the product to heat up during use? This memory stick is a portable solid state flash drive, the speed is faster a lot than ordinary flash drive, and it is made of metal material, which has better thermal conductivity, so that the heat will be much more than the ordinary flash drive. Your hands may feel a little hot, but this is normal. This situation will not affect your use, nor will it damage the data. Our products have gone through a series of sophisticated tests, which is safety enough in normal using. Why can't SD301 be recognized on a smartphone? How to solve it? First, please go to check the flash drive\u2019s format, please make sure it is EXFAT, if it is not EXFAT, please format it first (Before formatting, please backup all your data);Second, please go to check whether the OTG function is enabled, most of OPPO's mobile phones need to manually open the OTG function. Only when the OTG function is enabled, the data transmission of external devices can be carried out. So you need to turn on the OTG function of your phone. The details can be found on Youtube. You can search for \"How to Enable OTG Connection on OPPO Developer Options\" on Youtube. Why does the write speed of SD301 drop when I write to large files at once? Writing large-capacity files at one time,the write speed will decline is a common problem of most solid-state drives. Even solid state drives produced by well-known companies also have this problem, which is a technical problem, not a problem of our product itself. If you want to maintain a high write speed, it is recommended that you do not write more than 1/4 of the remaining usable capacity at one time. For example, when the USB SSD drive has 600GB available capacity left, you can transfer data less than 150GB at a time, the speed will not drop.

It gets hot while you are saving large amounts of data to it, but cools off quickly and it does not get hot while you are playing music or a movie from it. I highly recommend it. (Beware of sellers offering 2TB drives for $20 to $50 they are fake drives and are extremely slow and will not hold a legitimate 2TB of data. They will fail and become corrupt. I have had to send two of them back for a refund.) However, I heartily recommend this drive, it is legitimate and the price was right.",

The SSD is fast and I'm able to plug it into my phone and it instantly recognizes it. I do have to say that because it is an SSD it will get hot to the touch. This is pretty normal since it doesn't have anything to cool it down like a heat sink. But if you're going to use it to store files you should be good. Everything is metal and it feels high quality and strong and a bit heavy. Which makes it feel premium. I really enjoy this SSD.",

I hate having to pay for wifi on the airlines which is spotty at best just so I can watch a movie I have bought already. It's like having to buy my videos and music twice. This 1TB stick holds almost 100 videos (movies) and 500 songs in my play list. I'm no longer at the mercy of the airlines and I can enjoy MY movies and MY music MY way.I'm now entering the area of \"end of the line\" on my SSK 1TB stick. I've had this USB SSD for less than a month and I'm noticing a lag in my response time and loading time for videos and music play lists. No worries, I'm going to upgrade to the 2 TB version to put nearly my entire video and music play lists on file. I didn't think my data would take up so much room so fast, but it's putting a strain on the 1TB stick pretty quickly. My advice....Get the 2TB stick in the first place. That way you'll never have to transfer all your videos and music play lists over (which is a pain the a**). Both sticks are of superior quality and will serve me well for another year or two. They don't get hot (like some people stated in their reviews) maybe they are just touch sensitive. Get the 2TB version and you can't go wrong. I trust my entire video library and music play lists to these sticks. Get the 2 or 3 year back-up warrantee just in case (for reference).",
