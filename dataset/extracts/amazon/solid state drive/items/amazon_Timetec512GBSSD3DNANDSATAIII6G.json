Great SSD, and very much recommended",

                "reviewText": "Picked this SATA SDD for testing and development in the Linux environment and needed several storage drives that are least expensive and somewhat faster/reliable. Used KDiskMark to run speed benchmarks (539MB/s sequential read and 479MB/s sequential write). It's no Samsung Evo or Crucial MX SSD where they have faster speeds, DRAM cache, proven reliability, better warranty (5 vs 3 years), and firmware updates but they also cost a lot more. Overall very happy with what you get especially for the price and not having to leave the house with Amazon prime shipping. Customer support even reached out to me to make sure I'm 100% satisfied or if I have any issues. Only time will tell on performance when the drive fills up and if it manages to last.Item ordered is listed as \"Timetec 256GB SSD 3D NAND SATA III 6Gb/s 2.5 Inch 7mm (0.28\") Read Speed Up to 550 MB/s SLC Cache Performance Boost Internal Solid State Drive for PC Computer Desktop and Laptop (256GB)\" with an ASIN of \"\u200eB08GJBTXZK\" in case there is confusion with other listings.",

Laptops should be just as fast as their desktop equivalent but ive never found that to be true. Turns out hard drive performance has a major impact on a laptops overall performance.Ive replaced HDDs in three older laptops now with newer SSDs (of varying brands) and they have all greatly increased performance of the laptop. I installed this SSD (and went from 2gb ram to 4gb ram) in a first gen dual core intel laptop and it greatly improved its speed. I was then able to install Win10 on it and the laptop is running just fine for everyday internet browsing and document use.Cheap SSDs are worth an investment for older laptops or desktops. All are maxed out for speed now so any newer SSD would be good.+ Increases laptop speed more so than ram (in my experience).+ SATA interface makes it backwards compatible for older systems.+ Can help rejuvenate older laptops and desktops.+ Helps reduce gaming lag.+ Easy to replace in laptops. Only a screwdriver required. (unless youre missing screws).+ Cheap in price.+ Havent personally had any issues with Timetec products.- Possible to lose all data as SSDs cannot restore damaged files as well as HDDs can.- Would not want to use as a secondary storage device (unless just for games) or for important files. (backups important).",
