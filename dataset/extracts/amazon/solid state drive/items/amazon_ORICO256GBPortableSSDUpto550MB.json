It helps you switch from your laptop to the desktop while working on the same job and keep editing the photos on my desktops Big screen and faster processor. Great for photographers, videographers, gamers, DJs, and other users who need a backup. Warm Tips: 1. Unlike most portable SSDs, it arrives unformatted. In Windows, you'd need to go Start-->Computer Management-->Disk Management to \"see\" the unformatted drive; from there you can right click and format it. Until you do that, it won't show up as a drive. 2. Once you format the SSD it works fine (Windows users will probably want either exFAT or NTFS\u2014exFAT is more compatible with macOS and other operating systems) .",
