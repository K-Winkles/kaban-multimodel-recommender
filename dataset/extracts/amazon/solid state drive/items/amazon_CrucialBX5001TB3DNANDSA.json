                "reviewText": "A Timely Upgrade from Traditional Hard Drives:The Crucial BX500 1TB 3D NAND SATA SSD is a stellar choice for those looking to upgrade from older SSDs or move away from traditional hard disk drives (HDDs). As a user who has experienced the disappointment of a HDD failure, the switch to this SSD was not just an upgrade, but a necessity.Rapid Performance and Vast Storage:One of the most noticeable improvements is the boot time. The BX500 SSD offers a significant boost in speed, reducing the time it takes for your system to start up. Additionally, the 1TB storage capacity is a substantial upgrade, especially for those transitioning from lower-capacity drives. This ample space is ideal for storing a large array of files, applications, and games without worrying about running out of room.The Benefits of SSD over HDD:It's important to highlight the advantages of SSDs over traditional HDDs. SSDs, like the Crucial BX500, offer faster data access speeds, which means quicker boot times, faster file transfers, and overall snappier system performance. They are also more reliable due to their lack of moving parts, reducing the risk of mechanical failures. The energy efficiency of SSDs is another plus, as they consume less power, which can be particularly beneficial for laptops by extending battery life.Durability and Longevity:SSDs are generally more durable and can withstand physical shocks better than HDDs. This makes them a safer option for mobile devices and for users who are on the move.Ideal for New Builds and Upgrades Alike:Whether you're assembling a new PC or upgrading an existing one, the Crucial BX500 1TB SSD is an excellent choice. It's suitable for a wide range of uses, from casual computing to more demanding tasks like gaming and content creation.Verdict:In conclusion, the Crucial BX500 1TB SSD is a highly recommended upgrade. Its combination of speed, storage capacity, and reliability, along with the inherent benefits of SSD technology, make it a wise investment for both new builds and upgrades. The peace of mind that comes from using a more reliable and efficient storage solution is invaluable, especially for those who have endured the frustration of HDD failures.",

A SATA to USB adapter is needed; I picked up one via Amazon for less than $10. Taking my time, it took me a bit over an hour to complete the process of original HDD cloning to the new SSD & hardware changeout on my Asus K55A 2012 version laptop. With Windows 10 Home previously installed & an upgrade from 6GB to 16GB of RAM, the Crucial BX500 1TB SSD upgrade reduced boot time from 1 minute 10 seconds to 25 seconds! General speed has improved significantly; the laptop now performs like a newer & faster machine. Very pleased!",

                "reviewText": "I installed a 1TB BX500 in my Mid-2011 Mac Mini and used OCLP to install Monterey (the last MacOS optimized for Intel processors). Despite its lack of DRAM, performance initially was on par with that of the 240GB PNY it replaced, but after several weeks (of heavy use as the Photos app processed my large collection 24/7 - this context is key!) the WRITE speed plummeted to about 7 MB/s (per the excellent Blackmagic Disk Speed Test which can be downloaded for free). This behavior is reflected in myriad negative reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere for this drive, other Crucial models, and SSDs from other manufacturers. The MacOS Disk Utility app (even when booted into recovery mode) reported no problems, and moving the drive to the other bay with its separate SATA ribbon cable made no difference. I spent too long in chat with Tech Support at Crucial answering frustrating questions before giving up and exclaiming that I would exchange it for a drive from a different manufacturer, but later received an insightful follow-up Email with a link (referenced below if permitted) to a page explaining the situation and how to restore full performance. It makes sense (for all SSDs, not just this one) and proved effective! Here are the key excerpts that worked for my drive after weeks of continuous use: \"On a Mac, hold down the Options key while powering on to enter the Startup Manager screen. Leaving the Mac on that screen provides the SSD with power but keeps it in an idle state so Garbage Collection can function,\" and \"To prevent the SSD performance from degrading again in the future you can adjust your power settings to ensure the SSD stays powered on when your computer goes into sleep mode, which will allow Garbage Collection to run.\" To avoid any potential risk, I opted against issuing the Terminal command \"sudo trimforce enable\" as idle time should become adequate for routine garbage collection once my photos finish processing. I suspect many others are encountering this same issue so hope this helps.crucial.com/support/articles-faq-ssd/ssd-used-to-be-faster-but-has-slowed-down",
