                "reviewText": "If you\u2019re looking to upgrade or just replace your Mac hard drive\u2026buy this! It was so easy and it\u2019s been worth every penny!I love everything about my 2015 Mac\u2026except it came with only a tiny128GB :( This was enough while I was in school, but over time I filled it up rather quickly. I thought I was going to have to upgrade to a newer model, until I found out I could just swap out and upgrade my hard drive! I love that my Mac still has the light up apple logo, and it still works like the day I bought it, so I wasn\u2019t looking to spend $1,000+ to upgrade. Luckily I found this and tried it, and it worked flawlessly!I was a little nervous since I know apple doesn\u2019t play well with 3rd party anything. But the more I researched OWC, the more I saw they were basically as close to OEM as you could get and had fantastic reviews, so I gave it a shot. For 1TB for $120 it seemed too good to be true, but I\u2019m super impressed and super happy with this!Shipping was fast and the ssd was packaged very well. The OWC helps you very easily find your model and associated help videos/guides. The install videos are very clear and super easy to follow, and made changing it out a breeze! They sell toolkits as well, but I only saw this after ordering one from Amazon, but that worked just fine as well for the proprietary screws.The swap was so much easier than I had anticipated, I\u2019ve never done this before and expected apple to block it or be a pain, but no issues! Here\u2019s what I did in case you are doing this upgrade as well:1) Make a Time Machine backup on an external drive2) Make sure your Mac has the newest software updates3) Shut down and swap out your drive4) Power up and hold Command + Option + R while the Apple logo shows. Keep holding until you get prompted for a Wi-if network5) Enter your Wi-if details and follow the prompts6) On the next screen, go to Disk Utility and make sure your new drive shows and is formatted the way you want (I did AFPS)7) Save and return to the previous screen. Next, choose \u2018Reinstall Mac OS Monetery\u2019 (or whatever yours shows)8) When it\u2019s done installing the OS, boot up and choose \u2018Import from Time Machine Backup\u2019. Select everything you want to bring back9) That\u2019s it! My new drive works perfectly and Time Machine even saved all my downloads and browsers with the windows I had open!Some people said they had to make an external USB drive? I didn\u2019t have to do anything like that, but maybe some newer Macs require it. Mines pretty old (2015) so I\u2019m sure a lot has changed.I also got some awesome speed increases, my write speed increased by almost 80% and my read spread by almost 30%! For $120 to get much better speeds and a normal amount of storage (1TB) which Macs should come with nowadays anyway, I\u2019m more than happy! I wish I would\u2019ve done this long ago, I\u2019ve been deleting things so often just to make room for Mac OS updates due to the tiny drive hahaNext step, my super old batteries have been slowly swelling, time to see if they offer an upgrade there too! Definitely recommend OWC for any apple upgrades!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m so glad I got this, I\u2019ll get a few more years of use out of my laptop (Macbook Pro 15\u201d retina late 2013). Installed easily, but the disk utility was having trouble locating it. I\u2019m nowhere near any in-person Mac repair, holding a baby, needing my laptop for work, not sure what to do. I saw the phone number on the box and thought, what else am I gonna do? I was totally unprepared to get a REAL person, right away, no long phone queues, who walked me through the issue with ease. Took 10 minutes to resolve the issue and get my new drive on its way. I am so happy I called that number!! Thank you for your help, my new drive is now up and working great. I finally had enough disk space to upgrade my OS and all the software that couldn\u2019t be upgraded until I got the newer OS!",

                "reviewText": "My OEM SSD failed (folder icon with \"?\") so ordered the OWC 1.0TB Aura Pro X2 for my Mid-2015 MBP 15 Retina. Installation was simple. However, the drive didn't show up initially on Disk Utility. A call to OWC tech support solved the issue.Restart Mac with Comm + Option + R and then format In Disk Utilities, one must \"view all volumes\" (see photo) to see the drive and then it goes normally. Drive speed is 50% faster than OEM ssd, 2300 Read/ 2700 Write and it's 1TB not the 512mb OEM.Mac boots & runs perceptively faster. This is a great upgrade for $110. It also saved me having to get a newer Mac. Thanks OWC for another great Mac upgrade product! ....I did not get paid for this review btw. just happy to keep my current MBP.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to upgrade a 2015 MacBook Air. At first it would not recognize the ssd when I tried to install a fresh os. I took the ssd and put it in an external enclosure (that I already had) put the factory ssd back in the MacBook. Then I booted the MacBook and connected the ssd with the enclosure through usb. It recognized it immediately so I then installed the os to it and powered down the Mac. Next I took the ssd out of the enclosure and installed it into the Mac and it booted up and everything worked well. Little slow and tedious to have to do it like I did but it works so overall I\u2019m happy",
