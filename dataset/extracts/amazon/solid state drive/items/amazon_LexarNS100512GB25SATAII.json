I'll just zip down to Best Buy and get one! Did that. No problem, only when I tried to install it, the computer wouldn't recognize it! After fiddling with the cable setup, I decided to swap the new cable over to my working SSD. Sure enough, didn't recognize and wouldn't boot the computer. Bad cable... Replaced that, and now everything is just fine. Works well, data transfer speeds were identical to my Samsung SSD. No complaints so far!",
