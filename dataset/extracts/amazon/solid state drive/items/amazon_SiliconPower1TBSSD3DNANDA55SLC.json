SLC Cache Technology for Performance Boost and Longer Lifespan The A55 especially applies the \u201dSLC Cache technology\u201d that allows all data to be written in the SLC portion first and leads to higher peak writing performance. In addition, the technology can reduce write amplification and thus offer better endurance and longer lifespan of the SSD. Free-download SSD Health Monitor Tool - SP Toolbox Software The A55 comes with a free-download SSD health monitor tool - SP Toolbox Software, which is especially designed for you to easily monitor the current health status of a SSD. By such, you can run a performance test, get an overall health evaluation and check detailed information about your SSD, including used space on device, device temperature, total bytes written, S.M.A.R.T. status, erase count status and block numbers. *Please download the software at SP Official Website. Absolutely Reliable with Bad Block Management The A55 is built with Bad Block Management, which can continually monitor and replace bad blocks to keep your system in good condition with prolonged lifespan of a SSD.
