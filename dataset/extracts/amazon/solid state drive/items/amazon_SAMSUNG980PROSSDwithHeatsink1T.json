                "reviewText": "TL;DR I give this a 9/10 with only one point off because it's more expensive than other options, although it's also faster than said options.I chose this drive because I wanted excellent performance and capacity without any compromises. This was my first M.2 NVMe drive and boy am I impressed! Installation was easy with the only issues being related to the mount and heat sink on the motherboard. Once installation was done, installation of the OS onto this drive was easy and identical to the process to installation for a SATA drive.I primarily use this in a PC I've built for gaming using an Intel 13700K and a GeForce GTX 1080Ti. Loading times of games is absolutely impressive. Playing Diablo 4 the loading time is about 1 second to get from the game menu to moving around in-game. Not all games load instantly though, but every game certainly loads much faster than when played off of a SATA drive. Forza Horizon 5 still takes about 5-10 seconds which is only about half as long as it took to load on my previous SATA3 SSD.The Samsung Magician software that manages these drives and updates firmware is simple and unobtrusive. I do recommend installing the software as it not only ensures you get timely firmware updates, but also that your drive is optimized properly for your OS. The app also allows you to benchmark your drive to ensure you're getting the speed that you paid for.Pricing is always the challenge with Samsung NVMe drives. Other drives may be slightly slower, but cost significantly less. My recommendation is that if you're looking for the top speed and price is no option, take a look at this drive. If you are more price sensitive but can wait for a sale, watch for a bigger discount. I purchased this on Black Friday or Cyber Monday and saved $100. Regardless, you can't get a better drive!This drive gets a 9/10 with only one point off for the high price point. If it was cheaper I'd have bought two - one for a backup!",
