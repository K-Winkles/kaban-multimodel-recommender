                "reviewText": "BOTTOM LINE:1. I recommend this KingSpec Z5 512GB Portable External SSD with RGB Light.2. The current price of ~$56 is reasonable.LIKES:- It's fast. I was only able to test is on a USB 3.1 Generation 2 port with a maximum speed of 10 Gbps or 1250 MB/s instead of a USB 3.2 2x2 port with a maximum speed of 20 Gbps or 2500 MB/s. Using Crystal Disk Mark software, I tested it at 1000.85 MB/s read speed, and 815 MB/s write speed. I used a 16GiB test file. Now this is no where near the theoretical limit using my USB 3.1 port of 1250 MB/s. I'm going to cry \"foul\" on their advertised speeds. Perhaps I could find a small file size that would match the claimed specs if I tried hard enough. With that said, this is a speedy drive that will help me quickly transfer files of decent multi-gigabyte size between machines.- Works even through a hub. I did notice speed degradation, most likely because my hub is only USB 3.1 Generation 1 with 5MB/s limitation. I didn't choose to dive into this much. I'm more interested in practical usage versus theoretical usage. This drive serves my purposes. 4TB is the claimed maximum but as for now, only 2TB is available. I suspect that an M.2 NVMe drive is packed inside this case based on the shape, size, and performance specs. I can always use and adapter and a spare M.2 drive to do the same thing, but this package is strong, durable, and heavy. In other words, well protected.- LED lights are fun. Breathing effect is my favorite effect due to the limited distraction.DISLIKES:- I would like an optional USB-A connector instead of only a USB-C connector. I realize that will reduce speeds when using such a port, but I had to opt for either a spare USB-C port, or a USB-C port running through a USB-C attached hub on one of my computers. I won't be able to use this on one of my older machines with no USB-C ports. Quite irritating for portability purposes.- LED lights are not optional. Blue is disruptive to my sleep at night at there is no way to avoid blue in the color cycling.",

                "reviewText": "This new wave of high volume portable storage is great. These are just a little bigger in size than a flash drive but have a lot more storage. They are smaller in size than a portable 2.5\u201d SSD drive but you can\u2019t change out the drive for a different storage size, although you can get one of these with a lot of space (2TB). They are a lot more durable than an external drive since the storage and case are formed together. It really is a good compromise between a flash drive and an external drive.The drive I got has 512GB of storage space in a small, very solid package. It feels like you could throw this around and it would not harm the drive at all. It is super-fast if you have a decent cable and machine to connect it to. On first connection to a PC, it connected instantly and transfers between the system drive and this portable drive were very fast.The drive came formatted in NTFS, which is good for PCs but not so good for Apple products. I reformatted it to exFAT so I could use this to transfer between PC and Apple. As the product description notes, this does not work with an iPhone. I connected it to an iPad and that worked just fine, copying between the iPad and device. I\u2019m sure t will work just as well with Macs.One of the things I do is review and edit video files and occasionally we need to transfer the files from person to person. With the really large ones, up to 500GB, pushing them up to a cloud server and dragging them back down takes a lot of time. This little portable drive will save us a ton of time when we need to transfer these large files around.",

                "reviewText": "It's an external hard drive basically... NVMe/SSD actually, I guess. Basically a bigger, faster, more stable and resiliant thumb drive. It's great. It's been able to plug and play with both my Windows and Linux PCs and Raspberry Pi's (also linux). The read and write speeds both seem very good. Better than any of my previous external SSDs. I haven't run any benchmarks, but I it's performing better than I expected and don't really want to waste the time to prove to myself that yes, it is fast... it's apparent just by using it.I've never heard of this company before, but they seem to make a good product. Since money seems to be getting a bit tight with the economy lately, I've started buying generic and store brand things... I see something like this as much the same. And like with most store brands I've found that the quality meets or exceeds that of the bigger more expensive name brands. I guess time will tell with this if it holds up. But I'm impressed enough with it that I bought an internal NVMe SSD to install directly into my computer. Been wanting to build a NAS lately, and I think I might just go with this brand for the storage since it seems to be pretty high quality at a good price.The red LED can be a little annoying as it doesn't seem to have an off switch... if you work in the dark a lot with your computer, that can get a bit annoying... But I've got enough other LEDs going with my computer setup that it doesn't really phase me.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to like this external NVME (not SSD, as in the description) drive. It's built like a tank and has some weight to it and was instantly detected and \"just worked\" on both Windows and Linux, but after realizing it came pre-formatted with an NTFS file system and very bright RGB settings that can't be disabled or even changed, it just annoyed me with how UN-user friendly it is apparently this company never heard of / doesn't care about user preferences.For whatever reason, there is also a bright LED of their brand name displayed constantly instead of it being printed on the case/device like every other company. It seems like a waste of power and resources, especially when there is supposedly a worldwide shortage of computer components.I've never heard of this company before and there's a probably a good reason so lesson learned and I'll stick to brand names I've heard of before.",
