The enclosure is very cheap feeling, though I can get past that and may actually help with heat.It did have an autorun BAT file and an icon file. I'm assuming the BAT file was to tell your system to pull the icon, though I have that stuff disabled and didn't care to check before doing a full initial wipe.Posting with a picture of CrystalDiskMark with the same settings as some others. I had it plugged into a USB 3.2 (Gen2) port. I noticed those that ran slower were on pots (like 3.0) that realistically are much slower than the advertised theoretical speeds for the standard.",

However, I had to backup manually, chunks at a time, because this drive has ZERO head dissipation ability. I.e., after just a few multi-gigabyte multi-file backups TO it, its speed (on my modern PC0 kept thottling back from 400-450 mbps, down to the 20s (!!!). The good news? This gadget DOES protect itself from burning up BY so drastically throttling back. The bad news? Whenever this \"throttling\" does happen, the drive's measured temperature has quickly soared from 30 degrees C to over 65. Weirdly, the case gets barely warm, which tells me all that heat just SITS INSIDE, until it is removed and allowed to cool for an hour. HOWEVER, after one finally GETS such big chunks of files ON this drive, it will be GREAT for portability, fast RETRIEVAL of files and reliability.",

Really good hard drives too that don't give me issues anywhere else. I bought this because it looked really cool. This hard drive never disconnects. Speeds are nowhere as fast as advertised, could be many factors in play but a lot faster than spinning hard drives. I don't have large files or transfer much. This thing is perfect.",

                "reviewText": "Good, convenient drive. The listing says it reaches 600MB/s. CrystalDiskMark says otherwise. This drive gets to 460MB/s, and I've already made sure the firmware was up-to-date. I'm also using USB 3.0, obviously given that USB 2.0 is 480mbps, or 60MB/s and I'm getting ~3.7gbps, or 460MB/s. The drive feels cheaply built, but it seems like it'd last a long time if taken care of. I'm kind of concerned the performance won't last long. Considering its price and size, it's probably a really good USB drive for someone who needs 2TB for whatever reason.",
