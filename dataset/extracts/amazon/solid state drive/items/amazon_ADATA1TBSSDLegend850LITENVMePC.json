ADATA SSDs are designed in accordance with the Serial ATA International Organization standards and have undergone rigorous testing to ensure they work with various operating systems. If my computer only supports PCIe Gen3, can it still work with a PCIe Gen4 SSD? PCs that do not support PCIe Gen4 SSDs can still use the said SSDs. However, the SSDs performance will be limited to PCIe Gen3 Levels. Why is my SSDs capacity less than indicated on the packaging? Your PCs operating system and the SSD used different calculation methods. SSDs calculate capacity based on the decimal system, your PCs operating system uses the binary system. Capacity on packaging x 0.93 = SSD for approximate capacity. Why does my SSD's read/write not match the speed that was advertised? Is there something wrong with the product? Speeds may vary because different test software use different parameter settings and test methods, and the different testing environments and PC configurations may also have an influence. Besides, lack of free space will also affect writing speeds. Do I need to defragment my SSD? Since SSDs don't have mechanical drives, so there is no need for defragmentation. SSDs are designed to write data evenly on the entire drive as much as possible, thereby reducing excessive wear on any one location.",

The out-of-box experience was great, seems to be working as advertised (in my case the speed is limited by the Gen3 interface) but I will soon use it in a new device that will take advantage of the Gen4 speeds. Temps are kept under control during everyday use and even while gaming.So far I have been completely satisfied with the product and the software tools ADATA provides are a great plus. I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for decent performance on a budget.",
