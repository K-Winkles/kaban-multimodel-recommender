I live in a remote part of the U.S. (southern N.M., up in the mountains - GOD's country, to say the least). Most Amazon deliveries have been taking a week to 12 days - we NEVER get 2nd day, nor overnight from Amazon any more. But this seller shipped the M.2 drive overnight! Yes, this cost me a few more bucks, but it was worth it.I installed in my new Samsung Pro Book 360 (i7 with 15\" screen) as a 2nd internal drive, and was up and running with minutes.Good Job, and ATTA Boy to the seller.FYI, I've been placing 90% of my recent purchases with B&H Photo, due to Amazon's terrible delivery service to our area. Until we get more great sellers like this one, B&H will be getting most of my purchases (B&H was out of stock on this drive). As a business owner & Amazon business customer we spent over $20,000 with B&H since Thanksgiving, due to their great delivery service...",

However, I wanted to clone my existing install and got it accomplished. I thought I might be able to help the next guy a little. I used a free, open source program called Clonezilla (after several attempts and work around attempts with Acronis to no avail). Side note, for larger replacement drives, you'll need to run the software in \"advance\" mode and set an optional switch for proportional imaging, otherwise you'll end up having to create a second drive for the extra space left on the new hard drive (ask me how I know, lol). There are some easy to follow guides on the internet, I think on the clonezilla website. Oh, the Clonezilla program boots off a usb thumb drive (there are easy guides on how to access boot options on the Surface) into a simple program so Windows isn't running while cloning, which is a good thing. You just copy the files to the thumb drive and boot to it.",

                "reviewText": "This Samsung drive blows away other 2230 at speeds of read and write. The most important part however is the IOPS. This is most crucial for gaming and it\u2019s more or less random reading and writing which is where games come into. So anything with a high iops will load games super fast. I put this into my steamdeck and man games load so quick. Also steam can save games super fast to the deck when downloading. It will literally out write what you download.. meaning even if you could download at 500gbs on the steamdeck this nvme would keep up and not take any extra time to write the game onto the drive. Highly recommend for a steamdeck nvme upgrade. Took 10 min to install and never looked back. They are expensive but you pay for what you get. Samsung has the best nvmes hand down. I only run Samsung nvmes in my computers. Their speeds are unrivaled and so is the quality of their products. I have Samsung TVs, washer and dryer and many other things by them. However I refuse to give my iPhone up since my purchases would not transfer.",
