                "reviewText": "I installed the PNY 4 TB NVMe into the PCIe x4 slot next to the NVIDIA 3060 Ti card slot on the Dell 8940 motherboard. I used a Bejavr M.2 NVME to PCIe 3.0/4.0 x4 Adapter, NVME/AHCI SSD to PCIe Expansion Card that I also ordered from Amazon. At first, I was only able to attain read speeds of 845 Mib/Sec and write speeds of 816 Mib/Sec. I updated to the latest BIOS from Dell and rebooted without improvement. After scouring the Dell forum for solutions, I was able to locate a thread that recommended resetting the BIOS to DEFAULT settings. After resetting the BIOS to Default, Read & Write speeds improved to 3245 Mib/Sec and 3280 Mib/Sec respectively. Very happy with this PNY 4TB NVME drive.",
