I plugged it in, and Windows recognized it as a USB 4 device. Like nearly all computers, I do not have any USB 4 ports yet. However, I plugged it into my fastest port which is a USB 3.1 gen 1 port. I transferred a 250GB folder to the disk and it took a few minutes. I ran a benchmark on the disk to determine how fast it could transfer files. The fastest speed I was able to accomplish was 468.7 MB/s. That is equivalent to around 3.8 Gbs. That speed is about 80% of the port's max bandwidth.Overall, it does what it claims to do and there is plenty of space on this disk.",
