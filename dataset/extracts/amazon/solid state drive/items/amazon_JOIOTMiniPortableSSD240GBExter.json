Replaced a unit costing four times as much, as did not need that much capacity. Occasionally dump the contests to a USB Thumbdrive for backup. Now have two of these for backups.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased 2 of these SSDs hoping that I could back-up to them. They do create a back-up of my data but when it came to the drive image it failed on both drives each one connected to two different computers, so it isn't the computers. I researched the the error message, I/O device error (0x8007045d), and found a Microsoft support page that described the error as a start up program being the problem. I disabled start up programs as the article described and found there weren't any programs that were affecting the drive. I can't find the manufacturers website for support, made in China. I called Amazon and they would replace the drive, refund, or give me courtesy credit, I took the credit and keep the drives as they did work. I have another SSD of a difference manufacturer and that drive will create an image, so I used the credit to purchase another Crucial drive from Amazon.Cables are an issue with both drive manufactures. JOIOT has a USB a to USB c and a USB c to USB a adapter, the cables are just a few inches long. I purchased 3 new 1.5 foot cables adding another 10 dollars to the cost of the drives.",

And it works as OTG connected to my phone. Fits easily in the pocket. It does heat up with continuous use, so I won't leave it permanently plugged in. Very happy with this one.",
