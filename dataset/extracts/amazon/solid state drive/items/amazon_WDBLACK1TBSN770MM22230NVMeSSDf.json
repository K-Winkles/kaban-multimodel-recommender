It is the first 2230 form factor NVMe SSD and is an easy way to increase your storage. As it is a Western Digital SSD I feel comfortable using it as I have several WD SSD's that work flawlessly.You can use an adapter if you want to use it in other devices such as a desktop or even a laptop in an external adapter. It has fast read and write speeds as well. I am currently using it in an external SSD adapter to test it with my desktop and laptop but plan on using it with the ASUS ROG Ally that I am planning on getting in the very near future. So far, it has worked perfectly with no issues at all. As with all of my WD products, I absolutely recommend the WD BLACK 500GB SN770M M.2 2230 NVMe SSD!",

                "reviewText": "The WD_Black SSD was exactly what I needed. I had some limited space for a 7\" Mini Monitor and needed to overlap some of my PCIE connection so I needed the smallest SSD I could get. I used a 2242 adapter and I was able to run my mini monitor without it overlapping the SSD and potentially causing any heat issues.To install this it's the same as any other SSD, you will need to format the drive, name it, and partitiion the drive (if you want to but it's not necessary to partiition the drive). I've head less heat when temping it with a thermal infared thermometer in comparison to a full size SSD. It's worked perfect for me and I have MW3 installed and some other GPU/MEMORY hungry titles like Lost Ark, GRID, and BF2042.This is marketed for smaller portable units, but with an adapter you can run this on any PC you want, and have a cool talking point. The size of the SSD is impressive. It's tiny, and it's well constructed. I've had fun talking to other builders and they actually really like the idea. I can see more people using these on their full size RIGS as well.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Works Perfect for Devices with Limited Expansion Options",
                "reviewText": "This is a blazing fast NVMe that is more than good enough to expand the storage in devices with more limited expansion options such as the Steam Deck, various laptops, and more. I personally tested this drive with my Steam Deck, and it ran flawlessly. The drive was detected without issue and I was able install and load games off of it in no time at all. This is great as the Steam Deck only uses smaller drives like this, so I was more than happy that it suited my needs. However, this drive could also be used for other applications such as in a PS5, which also supports this 2230 size (speeds are under the PS5 recommended spec, but it will still work in the console.) This drive could also be used in a Desktop PC environment as well, but you would have to make sure your motherboard has mounting support for this size option or you may need to use an extender. Overall, for its primary use case as faster expansion storage for devices that can only use these smaller NVMe drives, it is an excellent option that will work without issue. The SSD also includes a 5 year warranty for peace of mind in the event of a defect or hardware failure. I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "In a word of cheap no-name SSD's on Amazon, this is a refreshing change. I'm a Micron Shareholder so I typically buy Crucial products, but I figured I'd give this WD a try when I saw it in the Vine program. I also use SanDisk products exclusively so I trust WD products. After roughly 1 month of use as a scratch drive for my photography workflow, I'm pretty impressed. I can't comment on direct storage because I'm using it externally but it's been reliable without noticeable slowdown during 30-40gb transfers.My sample from Vine is only 500Gb so I'm not planning on using it as an OS drive but I would absolutely consider one in the future.",

I still ran the drive in my system long enough to benchmark it, and it seems to be right on par with my other primary drives once I take the RAID speed increase into account- so it's very fast.Because I can't use it like I had hoped, I'm going to be using it for now in an enclosure for a very fast 500GB external drive. I uploaded a screenshot of a file transfer (read), and it's more than twice as fast as my otherwise fastest external drive. Blazing fast. File transfers while installed internally were approximately the same on average, but had more variation to the speed.",

The 2230 form factor is rather rare, especially for high speed drives like this, so this drive works great for applications where size is the limiting factor.",
