                "reviewText": "This thing is so compact it can probably fit into a card slot in my wallet, yet it holds 4tb of data in solid state with near instant access!The read and write speed says \"up to\" 1000+ mb, but after transferring roughly 3tb of data from my MSI gaming rig to this drive, I never achieved greater than ~600mb transfer speeds using my USB 3.2 type-C port and the cable that comes in the package with the drive.Speaking of cables, the cable that comes with the drive is only a few inches long, although it did manage to transfer data to this drive faster than my 6ft high speed data cable I use for charging my phone and tablet did. It would be nice to receive at least a couple of feet of data cable with this drive, however, given it's compact size, such a lengthy cable might increase the risk of misplacing this little thing.So far, I have not experienced any data corruption or loss, despite pausing a transfer and swapping out data cables before resuming, despite testing for shock damage during load/transfer, and despite having dropped the drive 3 times back-to-back from exactly 6ft 2in above the hardwood floor when not in use. The price is pretty competitive for the 4tb model that I got, and given the apparent durability, reliability and portability of this drive, I'd say it was worth every penny.I can actually see myself walking around with a pocket full of these things, one day.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to replace a couple of SanDisk SDDs that evidently have been failing a lot. I read several reviews on line about the Crucial drives and bought the 2TB version. The first thing you notice is this is tiny. See my picture. The Amazon pic makes it look larger than it is. It's not much bigger than a matchbook. It's well made, sturdy feeling, and has a metal top with rubberized bottom. It also has a lanyard hole in one corner. The cable is a USB C at both ends. That same cable, to support the high data rates, is pretty thick and stiff. But it's short so not an issue for me. My guess is you could use a quality Anker high throughput cable and get more flexibility. Minor issue. Data rate seems to be very good. Slightly slower in download than upload, but might be my imagination. I don't have a reliable way to measure speed, but one of my benchmarks is backing up very large raw photo files. It is indeed speedy. Great product if a bit pricey - but any good high capacity SDD is. I'm using it on a MacBook Air and MacBook Pro with zero compatibility issues.",

                "reviewText": "This drive is mainly used for file exchange between systems- one TB capacity, and transfer speeds up to 1GB per second. Small and compact, easy for travel, and no apparent issues with thermal throttling with high speed large file transfers- the package design with a metal case (good thermals) is probably a factor in that.The pricing is very attractive for the quality of construction and performance delivered- that was a factor in selecting this drive. The value proposition is very good, in my opinion. I expect to get more of these to use with dedicated test systems in my home lab.",

In Crystal Disk Info 8.12, no smart data is available if GPT is used, but disk health and temp data shows up if MBR is used.Disk comes formatted in xFAT, but reformatted to NTFS with no issues. Decent data transfer (400+ MBps data transfer rate in Crystal Disk Mark 8.01, USB-C 3.1 port, T470 Lenovo, win 10 pro / I7 / 16GB ram).No adapter included from USB C to USB A (as expected per description), and the included USB C to USB C cable is very thick and rigid. Included cable is almost as big as half the drive.Very nice form factor, and decent data transfer speed, but with SMART compatibility issues I have to knock off one star.Micron CT2000X9PROSSD9 per DiskGenius, Win 10 is seeing this as a SCSI device.Latest Beta of HD Sentinel (6.10.5d) added support for this SSD. None of the NVMe features are supported (one less \"*\" rating) but general health and temp are now showing up correctly.",

I will say that it didn't play those files from the drive easily but I could edit work with those files from the drive when it came to trying to play a file from it things got a little weird and I'm not totally sure if that's because I recorded something on one device and put it on the drive and then it was trying to edit it on the iPad or what but it definitely was able to work with those via iMovie and that was super super handy and helped me not have to break out a laptop",
