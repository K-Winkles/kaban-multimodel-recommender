                "reviewText": "This drive works great and is amazing for the price but be warned that you can't do a fresh install of Windows 10 on it without initializing the drive first. I bought this for a Dell Latitude 7490 as an upgrade and I tried to install Windows 10 from USB and the computer would just keep boot looping never getting past the Dell logo. This was never an issue with other drives like Samsung so I found it odd and in my research I found out this is a common issue with this drive on Dell computers. So I had to put the drive into an enclosure and plug it into another computer to format it and initialize it before it worked. From there a fresh install of Windows 10 could be done. Maybe it's Crucial's specific firmware but I've never had this happen with other brands of drives. Would be a 5 star rating otherwise since it works great and is crazy fast.",

                "reviewText": "There are something like 10,000 reviews on this Crucial P3 Plus 4TB PCIe Gen4 3D NAND NVMe M.2 SSD, so I doubt I have too much to add. After reviewing a seemingly innumerable number of reviews on this m.2 and other drives, it seemed that this was the best value for the money.My desktop has a number of older (like 10 years old) platter hard drives and I wanted to surplus them and increase speed at the same time. This device boasts 4tb of data and will handle my primary needs, allowing the HDD drives to act as backups. I didn't make this drive the boot drive as I intended it for storage, but I am reconsidering that (although the boot drive is a Samsung EVO SSD). Not sure which I'll do.Overall, after a couple of months, I'm very happy with this drive. The Black Friday sale of less than $200 out the door was a bonus.",
