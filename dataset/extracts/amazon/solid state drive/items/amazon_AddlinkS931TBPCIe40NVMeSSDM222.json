                "reviewText": "First off, this is a great price to performance option for upgradeable storage for your PS5, it's on par with the bigger brands in performance and undercuts the competition by quite a bit (anywhere from $30-$50). So, that's definitely a major plus, as well the fact that you don't have the hassle of having to add a heatsink since it's already preinstalled (though it's really not overly complicated, I've done so before with my previous 1TB SSD I had installed before).Nothing too crazy, you go through the steps and everything goes together without a hitch, works perfectly fine and I've successfully tripled my storage. Definitely not running out of space anytime soon, thank god! Now, to address previous reviews docking it for not reaching the \"up to 7200mb read speeds\" in the PS5, just as a heads up, Sony has the PS5 bottleneck the read and write speeds with ANY SSD that can exceed the minimum 5500mb requirements to whatever the current allowable read and write speeds are. So, don't go expecting to get that 7200mb speeds at this point. It's NOT the fault of the SSD and the manufacturer, that's on Sony and the PS5 at this moment in time. The SSD works plenty fine as is regardless.Just a heads up to anyone letting that one detail hold you up on whether to get this SSD upgrade for your PS5, it doesn't matter what speeds you can get up to it, it's what the current maximum speed is set for with the PS5 at this given moment. Highly recommend this one, especially at this price point, the convenience of use and performance. Definitely grab when you have the chance, prices have never been better for M.2 NVME SSD storage and this one trumps the majority of the competition! \ud83d\udc4d",

Ich muss gestehen ich merke nicht wirklich einen unterschied ob das System jetzt auf einer SSD oder M.2 Turbo ist aber ich habs gemessen und da ist auf jeden Fall ein Unterschied sichtbar.Aber ich muss auch sagen seit ich die M.2 habe habe ich nicht viel kopiert oder Daten verschoben wie ich das fr\u00fcher \u00f6fter gemacht habe, vielleicht w\u00fcrde ich da was merken. Wenn man einen ganzen Terrabite kopieren muss wird das schon auffallen denk ich mal. Und im moment habe ich im in meinem PC alles m\u00f6gliche, HDD SDD und M.2. Ich plane aber als n\u00e4chster einen neuen Rig zusammenzustellen und da werd ich mal schauen wie alles nur mit M.2 l\u00e4uft. Falls genug aussagekr\u00e4ftige Erfahrungen bzw. Daten vorliegen werd ich vielleicht noch was schreiben und euch daran teilhaben lassen =)Bis dahin kann ich mal sagen TOP Produkt! L\u00e4uft ohne Probleme, schnelle Lieferung und die Daten so ziemlich wie versprochen.( zumindest die Schreibgeschwindigkeit, Die Lesegeschwindigkeit nicht sie ist fast genauso wie schreibg. = 3029.88 MB/S (siehe Bild)).F\u00fcr alle die nicht wissen was sie da sehen, es wurde Lesegeschwindigkeit sequentiell und random gemessen und Schreibgeschwindigkeit seq. u. rand.((f\u00fcr alle was interessiert sind dar\u00fcber \u00fcber den roten K\u00e4stchen steht noch eine ca. 5 Jahre alte SSD wo die seq. Lesegeschwindigkeit gemessen wurde mit 520,96 mb/sec. ein Unterschied ist auf jeden Fall da von M.2 SSD und normaler SSD))Wer sowieso einen Speicher kaufen m\u00f6chte und Speicherpl\u00e4tze f\u00fcr M.2 frei hat dem empfehle ich sie auf jeden Fall, ausser ihr findet f\u00fcr den Preis andere noch bessere.....schauen kostet nichts sag ich mal",
