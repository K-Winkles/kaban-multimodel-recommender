It has an included heatsink to keep thermals low and it feels just as high quality as all the rest of my Corsair stuff.

                "reviewText": "Let's face it, storage struggles are the bane of any gamer's existence. Laggy load times, sluggish responsiveness \u2013 they can turn even the most epic game into a frustrating slog. That's why I decided to unleash the speed demon within with the Corsair MP600 Elite 1TB, a PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSD promising blistering-fast performance and enough storage to house my ever-growing game library. But did it live up to the hype, or was it just another storage wannabe? Buckle up, fellow gamers, for a review that'll have you loading screens begging for mercy!**First Impressions:** This sleek black drive arrived looking like a stealthy upgrade for my rig. The included heatsink hinted at its performance potential, and the compact M.2 form factor promised easy installation. From the get-go, it exuded an aura of power and efficiency.**From Lag to Lightspeed:** Booting up with the MP600 Elite was like hitting the nitrous button on my system. Gone were the days of staring at loading screens in frustration. Games launched in a blink, open-world maps streamed seamlessly, and even the most demanding applications felt buttery smooth. It was like I'd ripped out the bottlenecks and replaced them with pure speed channels.**Built for the Long Haul:** But speed isn't everything, especially when it comes to your precious game saves. The MP600 Elite boasts high-density 3D TLC NAND, promising endurance and reliability. While I haven't put it through years of hardcore use yet, knowing it can handle the long haul gives me peace of mind. Plus, the included heatsink kept temps in check, ensuring sustained performance even during intense gaming sessions.**Not Without Its Quirks:** The DRAM-less design is potentially impacting certain tasks, and I noticed slightly slower speeds in heavy workloads compared to some high-end DRAM-enabled drives. Additionally, the heatsink, while effective, might require some case clearance considerations.**The Verdict:** If you're a performance-hungry gamer seeking lightning-fast speeds, ample storage, and reliable endurance, the Corsair MP600 Elite 1TB is a serious contender. Sure, there are minor trade-offs in terms of raw performance under extreme loads and heatsink size, but for the price, overall speed boost, and peace of mind, it's a true game-changer. So, ditch the storage lag and unleash your inner speed demon \u2013 the MP600 Elite awaits! Now, excuse me while I go conquer some digital worlds at warp speed \u2013 thanks, Corsair, for the upgrade!",
