You can use \"Disk Management Tool\" to format and partition the SSD, and then use it in \"Windows Explorer\". Why is the product capacity displayed on the computer not 1TB or 2TB? Because the manufacturer's calculation method is 1TB=1000MB=1000000KB=1000000000B, and the computer system's calculation method is 1TB=1024MB=1024*1024KB=1024*1024*1024B, so the capacity you see is 1TB=(1000*1000*1000)/(1024*1024*1024)TB\u22480.93TB. Why does the test speed of Fanxiang S660 NVMe SSD fail to reach 5000MB/s? The nominal speed is tested when connected to the PCIe Gen 4x4 interface. If connected to a PCIe Gen 3x4 interface, speed will be limited to 3500MB/s. If you use it in an SSD enclosure, the speed will be limited by the speed of the enclosure. Why do I need to install the heatsink of the S660 M.2 SSD myself? Considering that some buyers install it inside a laptop or desktop, we distinguish the M.2 SSD from the heatsink. In the future, we will install heatsinks on all products and then send them to Amazon.",

                "reviewText": "I am always upgrading my system and am very picky about the parts I use. They have to perform well and be at a decent price for the performance. This drive was already on my short list and it was on sale during the latest prime days so I picked it up. My system is setup where I have the fastest drive for my OS, then I have a fast drive for my working files and then I have a larger area for larger file/archiving. For reference, The 7119 bench above is actually my c drive and the nvme three is way faster than my mobo can handle, so that bench shows the fastest my computer can go for accessing an pcie4 m2 nvme slot. The other 3 benchmarks are where this item clocked in at. Very awesome speeds! I wanted to consolidate my 1 tb and 2tb nvme drives that I already had into this 4tb drive to minimize parts and give an upgrade in performance across the board which I was able to accomplish. When I did partition this into 2 drives, there was a small performance hit on the write speeds for the smaller 1.5TB partition whereas the larger partition maintained the bench above. The write speed went down to 6100 on the smaller partition. The overall actual size of this drive is 3.76 TB. I am very happy with the performance of this drive even though I have never heard of or used this brand before. I will be getting another one of these in the upcoming months. Performance and price are fantastic for this.",

PS5 on boot formatted the SSD and it read at 5036r/w speed. (I forgot the units the speed is measured in but the P5 said it was the right speed)",

As soon as I booted it up it formatted the drive and ran a read test on it. 6308 MB/S is quite amazing. I ordered a separate heat sink but this drive doesn't really need one on its own.
