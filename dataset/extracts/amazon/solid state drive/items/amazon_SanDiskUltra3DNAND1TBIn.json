                "reviewText": "Firstly, I want to go ahead and state the following:While everyone moves to M.2 and PCI-E based NVME storage, I still recommend SATA based SSDs as the best bang for your buck. If you look at synthetic or simulated test scores from software like crystal disk mark, you may be easily swayed to pay the premium for NVME, however, real world usages still shows that SATA SSDs are still very close in terms of game / application loading speeds. Yes, the NVME is faster, there is no denying it, but at this juncture if you are looking to keep costs low, you can feel confident in still buying a standard SSD.With that out of the way, I particularly want to state that I have had really good luck with Sandisk drives, with zero failures to date. This 2TB drive is still fresh so I can't comment on its longevity, but it booted fine and is not showing signs of early failure. To be perfectly honest, you can likely even go for the lower tier variant and not notice any real world difference in performance, but I chose the extreme because the price difference is small and when I build for someone else I tend toward slightly more premium options.",
