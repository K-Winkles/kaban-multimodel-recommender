                "reviewText": "This adapter is very easy to use, you just seat your mSATA drive, screw it down, and install this like a normal 2.5\" SSD. The side and bottom holes are present for mounting however your case or laptop require, and the mSATA is kept in place while still being able to breathe. The blue power light on this shows when there is power, I did not see a blinking activity light. Speeds were good, mind you they are pretty much entirely dependent on what drive you're actually using with this, but my old Samsung PM851 did just fine, I was pleased.For anyone looking to reuse a spare mSATA in a laptop or desktop that wasn't built with a slot for one, this is a great way to get it done, it basically turns the mSATA into a proper universal 2.5\" SSD. It was very easy to install, and the quality of materials seems very sturdy, real metal and not plastic, very nice. I am perfectly satisfied with this and would gladly choose it again- 5-stars!",

                "reviewText": "I like that this adapter has a frame so it\u2019s a drop-in replacement for a regular 2.5\u201d drive without letting it sit loose or having to print my own 3D bracket, with mount holes on the sides and bottom. I would say it\u2019s closer to a 9.5mm height, and one of the little power regulators does stick up a little above the frame, possibly a concern if you\u2019re trying to use it in a super-tight laptop bay, but I had no issues and I\u2019m overall very happy with it.",
