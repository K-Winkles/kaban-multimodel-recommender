The best part of this SSD is that comes with a screw which is necessary for install it. It was very easy to install; actually my 15 years old son installed it with no time.I have installed this SSD just 10 days ago; amazingly it work great and perfect. This is really worth for money.Lesson learnt: It is not necessary that the unknown brads should be low in quality and performance than the known brands. I'm so happy that I have decided to buy this and feel its a wide decision. Time has to tell how well it would work.I would recommend to buy this SSD with confidence.",

Well, it works just fine on the games I have tried. Rumor is that Ratchet and Clank needs full speed. I will keep that one on the main board. I think most everything else can go onto this.One thing. When assembling there are no instructions. Put the thick white pad on top of the square chips, and the thing grey pad on the flat bottom. Then align the two metal halves together on one side, and snap the other side together. I tried sliding it on, and no way that would ever work because of the exposed adhesive, hah. Works perfectly as best I can tell in ps5. If I had to do it over again, would have gotten the faster speed, but I guess I saved a few bucks and it hasnt seemed to matter.",

                "reviewText": "Il est livr\u00e9 avec quatre bandes thermocollantes, deux blanches, deux argent\u00e9es, celle argent\u00e9e va sur la base m\u00e9tallique en bas car elle est plus fine que la blanche, puis la blanche va sur le chipset du SSD, puis vous fixez le dissipateur thermique uniquement. il faut en utiliser un de chaque. Lorsque vous fixez le SSD, ne le forcez pas ou vous cassez les petites broches tr\u00e8s rapidement et facilement. La PS 5 lit le SSD rapidement apr\u00e8s red\u00e9marrage c'est un tr\u00e8s bon produit que je recommande.It comes with four thermo past strips two white two silver, the silver one goes on the metal base at the bottom as this is thinner than the white, then the white goes on top of the SSD's chip set then you afix the heat sink you only need to use one of each. When you afix the SSD it's self don't force it or your break the small pins it very quick and easy. The PS 5 reads the SSD quickly after you reboot it's a very good product I recommend.",
