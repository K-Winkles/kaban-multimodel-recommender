                "reviewText": "I was updating an old PC from Gen 3 intel cpu and motherboard to a Gen 8 for my kids (gen8 cpu and motherboard were much less than $200 total). I had added decent amount of ddr4 memory, more aggressive cpu cooling, and a much better video card as well (I had upgraded my video card in my rig so had a spare available). But it still was bogged down. Finally figured out it was constantly hitting the old hdd. Pretty much 100% disk usage constantly.This M.2 was under $60 even when adding sales tax in my area. Installed this M.2 drive in the computer. Did a clean windows install on the M.2 drive and then set the bios to boot from it. Works great now, runs fast on everything they need. The 1TB is more than sufficient. Old hdd is bulk storage if need more space for things like pics. Overall the system is now overkill for running stuff my kids like such as Roblox and Minecraft. Plus with Gen 8 hardware I can run windows 11 if I want to upgrade from windows 10 when it isn't supported (upgrade is currently free).With a grand total of less than $300 in upgrades (not counting the donated parts from my rig upgrades) it works easily as well as a prebuilt gen 10 system for what my kids do. It wouldn't do that without this M.2 ssd drive, and the <$60 cost is great.",
