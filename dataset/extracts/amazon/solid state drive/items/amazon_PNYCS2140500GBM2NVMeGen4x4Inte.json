The original SSD is a Gen 3, but comes installed in the Gen 4 slot, so it's advantageous to move it and install this PNY Gen 4 SSD in the Gen 4 slot of the computer. After installing it it's necessary to use the hard disk tools to initialize and format the new SSD, then the computer will recognize it. After that it started up and ran slow at first while the computer reloaded the cache and recognized the new hardware. Once this was done it runs very fast and I'm happy with the new storage.",

                "reviewText": "Our son's SSD was only 512GB and with all his games and other stuff he was running low. We got him this one which should last for a good amount of time. For less critical data he can have one of the unused 3TB HDDs. Supposedly the gen4 NVMe in combination with Windows 11 has a significant advantage via DirectStorage, i.e. instead of decompressing gaming data on the CPU it loads them compressed onto the GPU where they will be decompressed. With the NVidia 3080 in the system this should be fairly quick. However, not many games support it yet. But at least with this SSD it should work fine. Btw, it's not the fastest Gen4 on the market but still really fast.",
