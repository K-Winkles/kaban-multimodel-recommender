                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars An absolute must if you require true sustained large capacity speeds",
                "reviewText": "TL;DR: This drive personally verified capable of large, sustained reads for hours if needed and had no problem transferring 500GB+ of data (both read and write) without slowing down at all. If you're tired of external SSDs that slow down due to cache outs and/or overheating, this drive will take care of those issues.-------I've gone through several Samsung and Crucial external SSDs and one common thing is they all \"cache out\" sooner than later or even overheat and transfer speeds quickly plummet (sub 50-75MB/sec in some instances) when you're doing large (>100GB) transfers or if you're using the drive as an attached active media for real time use like using a replicated database or photo editing. If the job ends up R/W > 75-100GB+ I will always see drive slow downs consistently on those Samsung and Crucial models. They are good for small, quick transfers especially sub 25GB but anything remotely large and sustained and the slowdown happens.After doing a lot of research and reading along with personal recommendation from some fellow developers and editors, I gave the SanDisk 2TB Extreme PRO (you know it's serious when \"PRO\" is all in caps) a try.It is very compact and nicely built. Excellent external texture with even a corner clip hole. It comes with both USB-A and USB-C USB 3.2 2x2 cables and is ready for data transfers up to 2000MB/s.So how did it fair? I plugged it into my 1000MB/s rated USB-C port to backup over 500GB of data in one sitting and sat there and watched it transfer the entire set of data with zero slowdowns sometimes peaking OVER 1000MB/sec on large contiguous data asset transfers. This is a first among the pile of external drives I've used over the last 10 years.When it came time to copy the information back, the sustained speeds were still there during the entire transfer.I used it even to run some games for testing and it had no problems for Steam or Blizzard games albeit for normal use I use internal storage. I also did a couple of dev projects externally and it worked absolutely fantastic.As with most external drives, it does get warm during heavy use but nothing that is worrisome. I was able to pick up and hold the drive no problem.I tested it on both Windows 10 and 11 and Windows 11 is slightly slower than Windows 10 in data transfers under the same conditions but still peaked over 900MB/sec. It isn't the Sandisk's fault but the OS.Overall, I can't recommend this drive highly enough. It fixed all the issues I had grown used to accepting with my previous Samsung and Crucial models with expected slowdowns (it wasn't an issue of \"if\" but \"when\") and 2TB is spacious enough for now. If I end up needing more capacity I will pick up the 4TB version if needed but as for the 2TB model specifically? Highly recommended.5/5",

                "reviewText": "So was going through the install process on my PC, and not thrilled to see the notice on the SanDisk Firmware site that there have been failures with this drive lately. UGH! So I punched in my SSN# and luckily my device was not affected - I have the current Firmware.That scare aside, so far the drive has been working out fine. I'm using it as a backup for my 2tb home PC.I have it connected via a USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 20Gbps Type-C port on my PC to run weekly backups. The drive is not super fast, but it's fine for what I need. It's super light and portable - the size of my Android phone, so ideal if you need an external drive for your laptop or whatever. And it's 4tb so should be enough for whatever you need to do.Keeping my fingers crossed that the Firmware fix does the job!",
