        "description": "GET THE PERFORMANCE OF INDUSTRYLEADING NAND AND PCIe GEN4 FOR DATAINTENSIVE APPLICATIONS The performance from industry-leading 176-layer NAND and PCIe Gen4 with the capacity to manage expanding workstation, gaming and corporate PC applications The Micron 3400 SSD is a future-proof solution that will harness the mammoth I/O loads needed to manage today's 4K (and tomorrow's 8K) double- or triple-monitor, work-from-home setups that have blurred the lines between personal and work-related tasks. The Micron 3400 SSD is ready for higher-resolution work and personal videos. Its speed and capacity make creating and saving additional copies of projects easy. It thrives on complex accounting and active asset and security management applications. Users need the high-performance, high-capacity storage that professional applications like real-time 3D rendering, computer-aided design (CAD), and animation require. MICRON 3400 SSD KEY BENEFITS Innovative Industry-First 176-Layer NAND on PCIe Gen4 to Tame the Most Demanding Use Cases Micron was the first in the industry with 176-layer massproduction NAND, enabling low-power, high-speed, dense storage solutions. This amazing technology brings 35percent better die-level read and write latency. Combining its 1,600 MT/s bus with PCIe Gen4, the Micron 3400 SSD offers 2x the read throughput and up to 85percent higher write throughput, while also delivering up to 67percent faster random read and 40percent faster random write performance than our prior-generation SSD with NVMe. The Capacity to Unleash the Most Data-Intensive Applications The Micron 3400 is available in capacities up to 2TB to accommodate client applications' growing footprint. Harness mammoth data to manage today's 4K (and tomorrow's 8K) video-editing challenges. Get the high-capacity storage that professional applications like real-time 3D rendering, CAD, genomic sequencing, and animation require. Power-Efficiency for All-Day Computing Due to its advanced power efficiency, the Micron 3400 SSD is listed on the Intelandreg; Modern Standby Partner Portal Platform Component list and meets open labs' SSD test requirements of Intel's Project Athena. This is a critical proof point for achieving client power efficiency (the Micron 3400 SSD offers 25percent lower idle power than our prior generation).",
