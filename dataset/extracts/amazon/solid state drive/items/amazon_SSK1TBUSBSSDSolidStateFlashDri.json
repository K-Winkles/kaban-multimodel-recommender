Can easily load tons of material for a road trip or to go over to a friend's houseI've used some flash drives that were large, but awful. I had a TeamGroup USB that copied only slightly faster than a floppy disk despite having 256GB storage. This is the complete opposite and for the price you are getting a wonderful product. It is durable, it runs cool, and it is -FAST-. Don't waste your money on one of the cheaper drives that will take a year to copy files -- this is what you want",

This one definitely gets warm after use, but it is so blazing fast. I have been using it for months now and have transferred so many files. I am extremely happy with it. The solid metal feel is sturdy and resistant while also protecting your fingers from the heat when you reach for it.It managed to make it through a hectic move across the country and I love the USB-C that comes with it. My Dad only has USB-C ports so it's perfect when he asks me for my videos. It transfers Gigabytes of data in seconds! Don't go for the ultra cheap ones, they don't store as much as advertised, are unreliable, and slow. My Dad lost Gigabytes of data because of this. Get this so you don't waste your time, and start enjoying blazing fast and reliable file transfers!",

                "reviewText": "I have purchased multiple high capacity jump drives recently looking for one that has large storage capacity, works for PC / Mac, and does not die or have issues when the data stored reaches some modest percentage of the total available space, and does not have mechanical issues. This solid state drive meets most of those requirements.......but only has a USB-A connector, so they provide an adapter for USB-c. Seems reasonable enough, I have lots of adapters to pick from already, but they send one with the product so I thought it would be a good fit. Not so, both the USB-A and USB-c sides of the adapter are not good mechanical matches so the drive droops when plugged in via USB-A or USB-c. Can't just let the drive hang out of the socket, so some care is required is using it. It does get hot, as some other reviewers have said, but as long as the case gets hot, hopefully the devices inside are not being stressed. A few weeks of use should tell us if there is an issue there. Four stars because of the mechanical issues, but otherwise it seems to be a reasonable product, which it should be for the premium price.",

                "reviewText": "2023-09-23 UPDATE:Do not buy this drive because it falls apart. See the attached photo.This happened to me soon after I bought my first drive, but at that time, SSK answered my email and sent me a free replacement.The exact same defect happened with the replacement several month later. When I emailed SSK recently, they refused to reply.The company clearly has deep quality problems. This is a shame, because the drive has potential.Also, the #1 feature that I used to like about this drive was that it had sustained good transfer speeds (see original review below). But lately I have noticed that its transfer speed seems to oscillate. (Well, it could be caused by the source SATA SSD that I am copying files from that is the culprit, but I think that it is more like the SSK thumb drive that I am copying to.)--------------------------------------------------ORIGINAL review:I am hungry for a high performance flash drive. I want an SSD on a small stick.The number 1 defect in every flash drive that I have owned up till now is that you get their rated speeds for maybe10-30 seconds, and then, due to crap thermal designs, the controller detects over heating and throttles the speed down by 3-5X. Disaster when you want to do serious file transfers.This drive, however, is the first that I have ever owned which seems to maintain its speed over long time periods. Writing a 20 GB file to it sees no diminishment in speed over the minute or so that that takes.I also love how the width and depth of this drive are minimal.My main complaint about this drive is that I do not like its flip cap. I would prefer a traditional cap. SSK: just make sure that you can put the cap on the non port end when you have the drive inserted, so that you do not lose the cap.SSK: you also need to revise this product to have a USBC-C version that gets the speeds of the Kingston DataTraveler Max. I would have bought the Kingston, but a) it is way too wide (causes port crowding) and b) it thermally throttles.",
