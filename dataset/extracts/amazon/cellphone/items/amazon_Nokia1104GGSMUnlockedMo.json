                "reviewText": "As one who is looking to 'disconnect' to the outside and 'reconnect' with the inside, this phone is the best that I've tried so far.It has no wifi capacity - a big plus. If you want a bit of data for I don't know what, you can get that through your SIM provider.The buttons are solid and do not jump, skip, or 'double press' as is the case with the other basic Nokia phones. Even typing messages is easy despite the limited keypad.It is responsive and fast.It is small, easy to hold (and could even be called appealing) and easy to read.An excellent choice for getting back to what a phone was meant for, making and receiving calls and, as needed, texts.",

But the problem is this only she can connect me , but I can\u2019t connect her. No matter how our cell how closer. If I call her ,she phone never ever rings. But if she call me .work !! So this is good phone if you don\u2019t like people call you no one can find you and you can find anyone and price reasonable. But I think I have to return because I can\u2018t connect my kid.",

                "reviewText": "Got this as I wanted a dumb phone. It apparently has internet but I haven't tried to use it, nor will I be doing so in the future.It's good for its simplicity. It comes with some games, none of which I will be playing.My one criticism is that it somehow started to forward calls to voicemail on its own. Not sure how this happened as I certainly did not select this option, and the phone was receiving calls a few days ago! I had to reset all the call forwarding, call barring settings and turn them all off, but since I never turned them on to begin with; this was rather puzzling.Another odd thing was that it had 3 alarm calls, all set for 8am. None were ever set up by me so that is also rather puzzling.The sound quality is okay, not as good as a smart phone, but that's to be expected.Battery life is pretty good. When the battery gets low, it will start beeping at you.Overall, I think it's good for what it does, a simple phone for phone calls and texts which is why I bought it instead of some fancy smart phone.UPDATE 17 Feb: Have noticed that sometimes, no calls are received and go straight to voicemail. Someone else had commented on this on another review. It's very frustrating.",
