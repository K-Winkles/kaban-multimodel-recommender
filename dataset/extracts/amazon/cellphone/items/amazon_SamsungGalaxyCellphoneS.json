It doesn't have 5g but is literally just as fast as my previous phone with 5g. Don't worry about the smaller size, graphics are still sharp as a razor. At first I didn't think the battery would be enough but I leave the house fully charged and do my 8 hour shift and watch netflix on lunch break and occasionally send messages while working and still come home with around 50% battery.

I bought this phone for my son who was leaving for college. He kept telling us that he can only use it on WiFi. I picked him up and saw exactly what he was saying. Couldn't make or receive calls and WiFi calling won't work. Turns out after calls and a trip to AT&T that they can't help me. Called Samsung and they told me it's locked to T-Mobile. Notified the Amazon who said I needed to take it up with the seller. Contacted the seller and they said I should have returned within the return period. So, I've got a phone I can't use and ended up buying another. Save yourself the hassle",

They just keep getting bigger, but Samsung got it right with this model. Enough features to make most users happy, and at a reasonable size and price. I put off upgrading for a long time because I just couldn't find the perfect combination of size, features, and price. I'm so glad I finally found this one. No complaints. Wish I had found it sooner!",
