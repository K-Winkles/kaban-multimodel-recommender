                "reviewText": "I'm coming from a pixel 3xl, so a big brand but a nearly 6 year old phone at this point. Even with its issues, that phone worked smoother (up until it died lol).The video playback on this phone seems to freeze/crash at least every 2 minutes, usually closer to 30 seconds. Audio is laughably bad. Even using wireless headphones, the audio quality is mediocre.Photo quality is mediocre, and the proprietary camera app needs access to your contacts to work for some corrupt reason. Power button and finger print reader combo is in the perfect spot to hit all the time. About the only good thing I can say about this phone is that it technically works, and the purple color is pretty.",

Came with Android 13. The wi-fi radio seems weak and somewhat intermittent. The 50MP camera, when selected as an option, does not zoom (just greater pixels in a shot?). Normal camera mode lets you zoom. Comes with the clear case.",
