                "reviewText": "Okay, so, let's talk about this phone. I really needed a mid tier phone with a good quality camera. I take pictures of products for work and need stunning images, so this was the #1 most important feature to me... and I'm blown away. These are near-flagship quality images for a fraction of the price. Here are some images I took with it:1. A comparison between my older Moto G Stylus 5G (left) and the A54 (right). I consider the Moto G to have a pretty decent camera and I've taken some stunning shots with it, but this is a level up. Notice that the Moto G really struggles with underexposure of the subject when trying to compensate for the brightly lit window behind it. The A54 photo is definitely overexposed in that spot too, but the main subject doesn't lose any detail.2. Same 2 pictures but zoomed in. The loss of fine detail and underexposure is even more apparent in the Moto G Stylus photo. The A54 photo is crisp and retains some fine details here which is impressive.3. 3:4 50MP mode.4. Same photo, zoomed in. The resolution here is phenomenal. If you zoom in even further, you can see the individual pixels on the can label.5. Macro mode. Again the fine detail here is stunning.6-8: 3:4 50MP mode. Notice the clarity, fine detail, vividness and crispness of these images. I love how vivid the colors are.9. 32MP selfie camera. This camera is powerful and picks up details I'm not sure I even want it to, to be honest. Thankfully, though, it also has the skin smoothing effect to mitigate this. 32MP on a selfie camera in general is new to me and very impressive.Overall I give this phone's camera a 9.5/10. The only thing it lacks is a telephoto lens, but I wouldn't expect this in a $325 phone. Also, some of the images do come out slightly oversaturated which could be a problem if you want \"natural\" looking, slightly less vivid photos. Personally, though, I actually prefer this vibrant, enhanced look, so for my needs it's a straight up 10/10.Now that I've written an entire novel on this phone's camera, which is probably the most underrated aspect of anything in the world of consumer electronics today, let's talk briefly about the phone itself.1. I love that it's IP67 water resistant. I do not plan to test this, but I've ruined many phones by dropping them in the toilet or taking them in the rain so I like that I don't have to worry as much about that.2. Battery life is decent. Today, I charged it overnight to 100%. I had a video call with my therapist and after that I've been editing images on full brightness for a few hours. Then I wrote this review, which took like 45 minutes. I have not plugged it in again and at 4:30pm, I still have 68%. This is impressive.3. Love the size. My Moto G Stylus 5G was a bit too big to hold comfortably in my hand. This phone is just a tad bit smaller and easier to hold, but still has a big beautiful display.4. The awesome purple color is just the cherry on top of an amazing phone.Overall: Vastly underrated phone for a phenomenal price.",

                "reviewText": "First I tried a Pixel 7a, because I liked the typical Google enhancements. The fingerprint sensor, and modem were supposed to be improved over my old Pixel 6, but sadly, I didn't see it. That is when I decided to try this A54. While it may not be quite as fast as the Pixel, and it doesn't have voice type, or phone monitoring, it is an extremely well-balanced phone. It feels premium, and the software has a very smooth fluid feel to it. Also, the fingerprint scan has never failed me, and the cell signal is about 10% better than both the Pixel 6, and 7a. The bonus is that I got it on Prime Day and saved about $130. Features are nice, but reliable unlocking, and great cell signal with a smooth OS are priceless.Update 8/26/23: I've had this phone for a tad over 5 weeks now, and it is getting to be my favorite phone I've had. It is very smooth, super reliable, and does everything I need. On paper, this phone is no powerhouse compared to flagships, but I don't miss the extra power one bit. I'm not a gamer but I play games and I'm not a photographer but I shoot very nice pictures. Not once have I missed the extra power. That said, my biggest complaint with Pixels was the biometric security. Fingerprint sensors, and face recognition for me was 85%. This A54 has never failed to open on the first try since I've had it. Like I said, if you want the fastest phone this isn't it, but pleasingly fast everyday use doesn't always mean the latest processors.",

                "reviewText": "The A54 phone is a good middle of the road phone for those who do not want all the bells and whistles of the more expensive models. I have used the 5G functionality when it is available. The phone is much faster than my previous phone and takes better pictures. I can easily get though the day on a single charge (maybe 2 days if the phone is not used a lot).There are a couple of negatives. One being that it takes a much longer time for the phone to power on if I turn it off or restart it.The other negative (a major one for me) is the swipe functionality when sending a text. The phone almost always picks up the wrong word that I am trying to type. It also does not seem to \"learn\" (that is remember the words that I have type before). It is so bad that at times, I just manually type the text letter by letter.So great for phone calls and pictures, but a lot to be desired for texting (my previous Motorola model was much better with the texting functionality).",
