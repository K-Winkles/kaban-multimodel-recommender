                "reviewText": "Bottom line is, if you need a phone that works (and not much more), this is a great value. It's got some small annoyances, but it beats out paying 4-6 times as much if you don't need anything fancy.Runs Netflix, YouTube, and Maps mostly without issue. Camera is decent if you give it a few seconds to adjust. Came with a screen protector pre-installed. Positive(?) slogan on the backside for comedic effect brightens your day.Hardware is definitely underpowered- there's a bit of stuttering and lag with apps, so you'll need to be patient, and forget playing any kind of 3D game or application. Unusual audio/video stuttering during streaming can be an annoyance, but pausing for a second or two usually resolves it. Screen protector works, but is cheap and bubbles up a little where you get a scratch or ding on it; definitely recommend replacing with a higher-quality protector if you're rough with your phone. Speaker isn't quite as loud as other phones I've had, but it's usually loud enough. Battery life is enough to get you through a couple days, even with a few hours of streaming video, but it's risky not to charge it every night.Small annoyances with the OS: Dark Mode doesn't apply to some apps. Location is usually kept off, but the icon keeps popping up on the notification bar, which is worrisome. The interface has way more padding than it should regardless of font size chosen, making the whole interface seem crowded or zoomed-in. Alarms kept getting silenced because the Clock app kept getting its battery usage restricted no matter what permissions or settings were applied- finally stopped after messing with some things, but not sure what did it. Can't mute notifications for, or disable, proprietary hardware management app DuraSpeed. Can't get rid of or move the Google Search bar, though I think that one's Android's fault.What's not Android's fault though is the watermark on the camera which has to be manually turned off.",

If you have thin patience, definitely do not buy this phone lol.It takes a second for it to register me tapping the screen and also took a million years to download any apps when I first started up the phone. (Again, I've only had this phone for two days.) You also can not watch videos without restarting them because the FPS is always super glitchy until you restart it. The phone also gets overwhelmed (?) and sometimes closes out of apps randomly, even if it's the only app I have open. And it's not my wifi/data because both worked perfectly fine on my other phone.Battery life is also not amazing. I've only been on it for two hours and it's dropped 30%. However, it did come with a Type-C cord which is nice because I know some companies aren't doing that anymore lol. So if you want to pay $100 for a type-c charger and a crappy phone then this product is perfect for you. <3",

                "reviewTitle": "The mini manual just contained a few basic things .",
                "reviewText": "After a more thorough review of capabilities (involving dedicating some time to learn how to use it properly), I am now giving this smartphone a 5-star rating. The preliminary complaints were due to my unfamiliarity with a more sophisticated phone compared to my last Android 7 dinosaur.See my revised and additional comments at the bottom of this review. The existing positive comments till apply.There is no manual online for this model. However, there is a general G1 setup manual online. The display keeps dimming and going black within seconds. Then I have to go through the unlock process again. I have set it to stay on for 30 minutes, but it still keeps dimming and going black.After 3 weeks, I am still trying to sort out how to operate this model.I am using a pin on setup instructions. There is a face print reader, but have not found it yet.My above previous review was heavily redacted, admittedly written with some extraneous material.I must confess to wanting an Umidigi to work. Internet reviews range from zero to very good technologically. Owner Johnny Zhang has accomplished miracles in tech advances in his 15 years since its startup. Umidigi is one of the top 10 such companies in China. The phones are attractive, feel good to hold, colours are great, cameras are pretty good. I have been dealing back and forth with a support person since day 3. The English email responses can be confusing. A major concern is the CPU overheating (if it burns out, then I just have a paperweight left. I have constant CPU overheating on startup and have to run the cooler, and if left on for an hour, the same overheating notice appears and I run the cooler each time. I set up a separate monitor which indicates the actual temperature on the main menu.I do not have a phone service provider, but find it works O.K. with a sim and TF/SD card.I was kindly offered a new G1 model to test and keep if I would fill out a satisfactory survey. The model turned out to be an Android 11 vs the current Android 12. It lacks a few features that the 12, but it costs twice as much, is heavier, thicker, and longer, has a better quality screen, and 4 GB ram and 64 GB ROM vs the 12 with 2 GB ram and 32 GB ROM. With each new model, you have to go through a setup process, : language, Wi-Fi connection, etc. This one would not go past the Wi-Fi, even though connecting, it just keeps authenticating and save in a loop. So I have to advise support again. Admittedly, electronics and I do not make good bedfellows.I reiterate, I think Umidigi phones are great technologically, and I want to have a working one. I am slowly working my way through and finding interesting and amazing built-in applications within and easy to set up. They have a complete one-year warranty.Despite the problems listed above, I would recommend their products.As of this date (1/9/2023), I am giving a rating of 5-stars. After spending some time using the Google Assistant, I was able to set up many options. I know that there are more things that this phone can do, and will dig them out. I currently have 40 apps (Google and some others come already installed (and cannot be removed) and Google Play Store is protected). I set up a powerful cleaner that has 7 functions, and an antivirus, phone locator, etc., plus others of interest. I have since learned that Android phones can heat up to 65* C without damage to the CPU, etc. This one runs from 26 to 45*C. The cameras are quite good, but do not always capture the true colours, but there are various options to edit photos. I have used the music option and the sound is balanced stereo. At first, I thought the Assistant was deaf, but the issue is that this phone has only 1.5 Ghz speed, so it needs a few minutes to load apps and run smoothly. You will hear chimes as each of the main apps load at the top of the main menu screen. I use it several times a day, from 3 to 5 hours, with no problems. Battery life is good. I only charge every 4 or days or so, and only to 85% to extend battery life. The clear thick plastic bottom cover is a good safety feature. I did find a small chip at the top of the screen, previously unnoticed in the black rim around the outside of the screen. I have dropped it a few times.As well, there are system updates periodically to install. It is important to familiarize yourself with the settings app (a lot of hidden information treasures there).The pop out sim and TF/SD tray is triggered by a tiny tool which may be hidden anywhere in the product box.Support is available 24/7.Initially, I bought this phone primarily for emergency situations. But due to Covid, I have not signed with a carrier as yet. The good thing abut these phones is that they come unlocked and can theoretically be signed with any carrier in Canada (apparently not so much in the USA).After a frustrating period getting to know this phone, I would highly recommend it. For an inexpensive price, you are getting a gem to work with.",

                "reviewText": "La verdad es que me ha sorprendido este m\u00f3vil por el precio que tiene. El material es pl\u00e1stico pero tiene un acabado metalizado que hace que parezca metal. La pantalla se ve bastante bien y es grande, no tiene mucho notch. El peso me sorprendi\u00f3 porque pesa poco aunque tenga 5150mAh de bater\u00eda. Viene con una funda transparente de silicona y tiene puesto un protector de pantalla. Tiene radio FM y entrada de auriculares que casi ning\u00fan m\u00f3vil tiene.De los 32GB viene ocupado 5,5GB, que est\u00e1 bien porque viene bastante limpio de aplicaciones preinstaladas, trae las de google y poco m\u00e1s.La c\u00e1mara es de 13MP y adjunto fotos para que se vea la calidad.Se carga con un cable usb tipo C. Tiene para dos tarjetas sim o para una sim y una de memoria. Las pegas que le he encontrado es que le falta un poco m\u00e1s de fluidez, cuando se abre una aplicaci\u00f3n tarda un poco en cargar pero luego va bien. Tampoco tiene lector de huellas pero normal por este precio.Yo lo recomendar\u00eda para alguien que no tenga m\u00f3vil y necesite uno a buen precio o como segundo m\u00f3vil para trabajar.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Il cellulare si presenta piacevole al tatto e responsivo per quello che \u00e8 l'hardware con cui \u00e8 carrozzato (2 GB di RAM e processore Cortex A53) grazie all'impiego di Android 12 GO (la versione pi\u00f9 leggera di Android dedicata a dispositivi con hardware dedicato).Per 99 Euro (il prezzo attuale al momento della recensione) \u00e8 un telefono onesto che fa quello che deve.WhatsApp, Messenger, Teelegram, Facebook, YouTube e gli altri social funzionano bene e sono responsivi. Poco usabile TikTok perch\u00e9 risulta troppo pesante da gestire.Utilizzabile con tutte le app Google ed il PlayStore \u00e8 presente senza alcuna limitazione.Lo schermo \u00e8 responsivo al tocco e non ha problemi di fluidit\u00e0.Non \u00e8 presente il riconoscimento delle impronte digitali n\u00e9 il riconoscimento facciale, scelta positiva perch\u00e9 in hardware limitati creano solo appesantimento inutile.Come applicativi di utilit\u00e0 ho provato anche lo SPID di Poste Italiane (PosteID) e le applicazioni bancarie e non hanno avuto alcun problema.Buono il reparto audio (dal video allegato alla recensione si sente che ha una buona potenza).Meno performante per i videogiochi recenti ma questo non \u00e8 uno smartphone creato per il gioco.In generale un buon prodotto che merita 5 stelle per il rapporto qualit\u00e0/prezzo, ottimo come smartphone entry level da dare ai propri figli come primo dispositivo ed ottimo come secondo telefono da affiancare al dispositivo principale (io lo uso come telefono per le comunicazioni personali quando spengo il telefono dedicato al business).",
