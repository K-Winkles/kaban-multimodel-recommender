Shortly after receiving it, I noticed that it was doing the same things as the other one. Although the most recent LG G5 phone I ordered was supposed to be new, I believe that it was refurbished. It would restart by itself, in the middle of me using it. The screen would freeze and black out. I had a hard time even getting the home screen to come on. Whenever the phone did come on, it just did whatever it wanted to. This is exactly what happened to my other LG G5 phone. The screen was hard to turn on until it just stopped coming on one day. Overall, this is one of the worst cell phones ever, and I definitely won't order another one from Amazon.",

One of the main reasons I chose the carrier that I did was because they help their customers save money by utilizing wifi calling. I did not see anywhere until after I purchased and received this phone that AT&T did not unlock wifi calling. There are also a couple of other features that do not work. In my opinion, these phones should not be described as \"Unlocked\". They should be called \"Partially Unlocked\", or something like that. I'm only giving two stars because I am now unable to take advantage of wifi calling and save money with my new wireless provider.",
