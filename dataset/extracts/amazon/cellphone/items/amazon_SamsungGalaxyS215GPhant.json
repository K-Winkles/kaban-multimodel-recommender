Everything is much better than you can expect from a 220-dollar phone: incredible camera (I had an s21 ultra before, and the pictures are almost the same if zoom is not that important to you), 120 hz display is buttery smooth, excellent speed, and most importantly fantastic battery life. It is probably the best value phone in the market. You will have a premium experience with an entry-level price tag. If used or renewed does not bother you much, go for it, you will not regret it. And as Amazon allows a 90-day return policy, you can rest assured.Extra note: avoid buying from GreenTech Refurbished, the first one I bought from them, it was cosmetically very poor with super deep scratches on the screen even sometimes visible while the screen is onMANY THANKS, Seller Cellmigo, they are amazing, sent me almost like a new product even though I ordered good condition. So buy from them if available",

Battery life isn't great. I usually have to charge it in the afternoon. Body has some pretty sever scuffs. Looks like it was dropped pretty hard on concrete There was a sticker covering the damage, but once removed it is very obvious. And screen has some deep scratches. Wouldn't say the body is in excellent condition, but operation on the phone is. Charger that came with phone works very well, not a Samsung charger though, I'm okay with it. Takes the phone roughly 2 and a half hours to fully charge. Switched from an iPhone 11 pro max, and wow is this phone an upgrade! I selected the sliver color, but received the purple. Doesn't matter to me because it will always have a case on it. Phone was fully unlocked and I had no issues connecting it to cricket.",

I looked around town at local sellers but they all wanted outrageous prices, and you never really know what you're gonna yet. Especially where I live. I decided to check Amazon renewed phones just for my trip and I'm glad I did. This phone came in faster than I could get my s22 ultra replaced, and was in perfect condition when it arrived. Not a single scratch on it. The battery life was still good, and didn't drain quickly. It was also factory unlocked like it said, so I popped my sim in (xfinity mobile) and it worked perfectly. It even had the xfinity loading screen now at the beginning. I guess I got the luck of the draw compared to some of the comments on here. I have zero complaints. I just got my new s22 ultra back today, but I haven't transfered anything or swapped it back. I'm thinking I'm just gonna roll with this one for now, and keep my ultra for backup.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this product which is expensive thinking that it would work, however after receiving it, I have been having nonstop problems with the battery malfunctioning. I did have a warranty of 90 days, however I didn't know the extreme of the condition of the phone until later on. I noticed that the battery would drain fast, the device couldn't hold a charge, charged very slow and I always have to be around a charger just to use the device. The seller claims that the battery has a certain capacity but when i go into my battery setting it tells me that my battery has more power than the advertised power the seller claims - but why is my device malfunctioning the way it is? Because it's defective. If I had known what I know now I wouldn't have tried solving the problem and I would've returned it within the time-frame required. I tried everything to solve this issue such as trying all different types of chargers with different watts and I've tried all different types of charging wall ports... device when not in use for less than 10 minutes drops over 10%. I'm very upset with this purchase and the lost of my money into a defective item that barely works. I don't have much income at all so this is really frustrating. The seller is not compassionate and doesn't care about my concerns. I have asked respectfully for a refund or exchange, however seller wants to enforce their warranty policy instead of making a customer satisfied. I RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER!!!!!!!!! SHADY BUSINESS!!!!!!",

I know multiple sellers sell these phones and you never know what quality you'll get from which seller but my phone was in perfect condition from this seller and if I ever repurchase one I will look for them specifically! Shipped fast and had absolutely nothing wrong with it. No scratches, great camera, and great sound and love everything about it!",

                "reviewText": "I was very doubtful if buying a refurbished phone, because I never had one before, but I took the risks and decided to do it, and now I'm very grateful I did. The shipping was really fast, arriving on the next laboral day after I ordered it, and now that I have had it for a week, I have no complaints, beyond I had to buy a charger because the one I had before was charging very slow the phone, and the one in the box was not good as well. Beside that, everything is perfect, it had just one little scratch that's almost imperceptible, the camera is amazing, the ram and the processor is super fast, the screen is perfect, the battery lasts all day and it came fully unlocked, even I can use it in Colombia. Probably the best decision I made buying a phone.",
