                "reviewText": "this is probably my first Amazon review in 10+ years, that's how much this phone makes me angry on a daily basis. I had a super old iPhone that was okay, but I heard Android had the ability to block unknown callers plus some other things that made me think I should switch. I've had it about 9 or 10 months and I've completely given up on most of the \"features\" like the fingerprint reader so I've probably forgotten half of what I hate about this phone.First off, in the first week the screen got visible scratches from just using it. Somehow it's become the norm to get a thousand dollar phone then have to spend another $100 on accessories that are not optional.I'm not sure if this is my specific phone, I seriously doubt it is, but apps crash all the time, not buggy apps from small time developers, apps like Twitter and Amazon.As I said, the fingerprint reader doesn't work maybe 60-70% of the time. My girlfriend just unlocked her iPhone with her thumb on the first try holding her phone upside-down. This phone just \"bzz bzz. bzz bzz. bzz bzz. bzz bzz. Too many failed attempts, please enter code\" more than half the time. I just quit trying and now only use the pattern to unlock it.THE AUTOCORRECT. It is AWFUL. It doesn't auto-correct when I think it should, like typing something like \"e ertthing\" instead of changing it to \"everything\", it just says 'yup, that's good enough'. Then it auto-corrects when it shouldn't, either because it thinks I have a typo or it just $#%ing feels like it. If I type \"damn\" it changes it to \"darn\". That's not a mistake, you'd think that was some profanity filter but I can't find where to turn stuff like that off. Then there are the times where it auto-corrects a word it doesn't recognize, that's fine on occasion, but when I backspace, it doesn't give me the option to revert back to what I typed. Imagine typing a really long word, correctly, then it just overwrites it with something random and you have to delete the entire thing, re-type it, then go up and click the checkmark before it tries to do exactly what it just did again. Typing on this phone is SO AGGRAVATING.Do not disturb doesn't work with wireless headphones. If I'm listening to music over bluetooth and a call or text comes in, it just shuts my sound off. And if I turn on airplane mode and turn bluetooth on to get around that, music just stutters and skips like it's streaming over a bad network connection.I won't get into all the \"share all my info with Google\" settings that are all on by default that I spent a week individually shutting off after going into each app separately which get reset every month with the OS updates that \"add features\".Oh, and the \"block unknown callers\" feature? The big reason I got this phone? It doesn't work. I still get spam phone calls regularly",

                "reviewText": "I previously have S9 for work and iPhone XS Max for personal, here are my thoughts:The Good:- Speakers... wow... I am speechless- OneUI is wow, Samsung finally got the UI right, very user friendly and fluid- Feels very comfortable to hold, much better than S9 and iPhone- Screen is gorgeous, but a little too bright at night- Bixby Routine eliminated my need for Tasker- Headphone jack, although I didn't use it once, but it is nice to know it is there- Samsung Health is very very useful- All hail 8GB of RAM, all of my apps opened within the hour are still there!- Battery life is good (not excellent, pretty on-par with iPhone XS Max)The meh:- Power button is a bit too high, need to adjust grip when turning off screen- Back camera is good, but pretty much feels the same as S9 and iPhone (disclaimer: I am a dummy photo taker, pretty much point-and-shoot)- Samsung still nags too much on \"Here is what you can do on...\" and \"High volume can damage your hearing...\"- Micro stutter during animation, rare, but still noticeable during app switch- Fingerprint unlock to home is slow, and it is much lower than I expected, but once I got the position, it unlocks 9/10 times (move your fingers around during scanning, it helps a lot), and I didn't even remove the original screen protector- Microphone is sub-par... especially during call, other side can hear their own echo, not the same experience on S9 or iPhoneThe wtf were they thinking:- Proximity sensor, it is waking up in my pocket ALL THE DAMN TIME (turned off double tap to wake helps, turning off life to wake and AOD solved the issue, but I need to features)- Still very convoluted to pick pictures from Google Photo if I need to send pictures or upload pictures from other apps- Samsung Smart Switch is still a very miss, transferring to S9 to S10 Plus made the phone very buggy, have to start fresh and redo every thing- Samsung Keyboard... sigh... back to Gboard- Front camera... I want to see my face without looking like a 12 year-old damn it- Curved screen, I felt like it is even worse than the S9 (maybe it is the size), a case helped with accidental touches, but my god it is still happening- OneUI is awesome, but the way they treat folders... If I created a folder in the app drawer and put apps there, then put that same folder to home screen, why are they not synced? Why I must add the same app to folder twice? (I don't want to use another launcher, I used Nova Launcher for 6 years and just want to use the built-in launcher for the sake of simplicity)- On the few occasions that I cannot use the fingerprint scanner (enough to be a nuisance), I really miss the iris scanner... this was the #1 reason why I did not pick iPhone to be the work phone before- Samsung Cloud... still cannot see SD Card... just give up already Samsung...- Motion Photo is still not compatible with Google Photo (this has more to do with Google than Samsung, but Samsung uses their own format to save Motion Photo, so I am blaming both)- Power Optimization still sucks (again, Android's problem, not Samsung's fault)So in summary, I feel like each functionality of the phone works very well, but the unify experience is still somewhat lacking",
