                "reviewText": "I purchased this phone a few months ago since i needed one quick and it is definetly worth not picking up. I loved it at first, the screen was great the storage was large and battery is superb for my use. But as time went on the phone felt like it was slowing down. The UI is buggy and the phone cant keep up at times with what im doing. There are times where taps are delayed by seconds or it stutters. Also have had times where the UI just freezes on me for a while before i can continue. Im a driver so I use this phone for music, streaming, gps, etc quite often. I got it on sale with a gift card and I still think I got ripped off. Definetly worth skipping this one",
