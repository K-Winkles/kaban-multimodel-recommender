                "reviewText": "More generic Android phone and doesn't have a ton of custom apps preinstalled. I really wanted to purchase the Galaxy S23 Ultra, but out of my price range right now. This phone has the same CPU and more RAM and higher resolution screen. I've only had this phone two days and I'm still on the first charge at 72%!! I've never had a phone charge last that long with normal use. The screen on this One Plus 11 is gorgeous. Clear and sharp. There are tons of settings that help increase battery life too.Very impressed with 5G performance. I live in small rural town in East TN using T-Mobile service. All I had to do was insert my T-Mobile SIM card and turn it on. Using Ookla Speedtest app, I am getting 533mbps download on 5G. Even my Spectrum cable internet isn't that fast! The OnePlus also has WIFI 7. I only have WIFI 6 at the moment at home. The phone connects to my wifi at full speed.Love the cameras too. Not the 200MP of the S23 Ultra, but the One Plus 50MP main camera is still impressive and it has 48MP wide angle and 32MP telephoto. It also automatically switches to macro. Scanning barcodes is very quick. My previous Pixel 6 usually had a focus issue when taking pics up close. I'm still experimenting with camera settings and features. I really wanted something with a 'pro' setting. I have a professional Sony camera and sometime miss having the control. Most phone cameras do a OK job with point n shoot. But sometimes are too blue or green for my taste. I can edit in my PC, but much easier to do that adjustment before you take the image. Granted phone cameras still can't compare to a professional camera, but this One Plus 11 with the Hasselblad 3rd gen camera for mobile comes close.Also surprised this phone comes with its own charger. Battery Health Engine improves health and longevity, while still delivering ultra-fast charging speeds with 80W SUPERVOOC. Thought that was just marketing hype, but the charging brick does seem to be heavier than most chargers. If I had to complain, the included cable is fairly short. I prefer 6.5 to 8ft. Not sure if the 'red cable' is special, but will see if I can purchase a longer one. So far very impressed with battery life as I pointed out earlier.Seems like phones are shrinking. Although it is suppose to be 6.7\" screen, this phone seems small to me. I'm an older guy with small hands and still find this phone 'skinny'. I know they can't please everyone though. I just like something I grab more securely. It doesn't come with a case. Fortunately, there are many different cases on Amazon available. Simple silicon cases to heavier duty military grade. Hopefully the case I ordered will add some gripping width.So far I love this phone and highly recommend it if you can't afford the other flag ship phones.",

                "reviewText": "I was convinced to buy this phone after seeing the photos my daughter got with hers.what i dont like is no SD card for extra storage.256GB is OK BUT migrating from a well used established phone with its files doesnt leave me a lot for the photos i will be generating with this.it appears the phone DOES come with a screen protector on it. i didn't realize that and installed a second party screen protector, which caused a lot of issues which was quite frustrating, for instance the phone was near impossible to catch a phone call as the screen was not awakened on a incoming call. the touch sensitivity was not responsive and always misspelling and changing my typing, I spent a lot of time correcting the spelling of my work.... again extremely frustrating. after i observed the dirt that had collected under the protector, i decided to change it. and then is when i observed that there seemed to be a second one i did not know existed. ......... soooo......after installing a new protector all these issues went away. it has caused me to retract all the bad things i had murmured about this fine cellphone/camera with a poor interface.I still wish it had Micro SD capability a TB of extra memory, that would make me contented to a high level.when i initially set it up and transferred the old phone to new, i was surprised at the speed of which all the data i wanted was moved. photos, videos, all other documents. However it lacked the bookmarks of my preferred browser.i like the way it manages the battery usage, notifies me when an app is using too much and sends me to the settings to tweek its permission and usage the phone / system Shuts down apps that have not been used in a few months and removing permissions. I am not sure if it is the new version of android but, it is keeping things controlled instead of snowballing into a big mess that is hard to resolve later and running the devise into high inefficiency.as for charging it is screaming fast. it has a setting that will take its time also I believe it is good to avoid baking the battery every time you charge. and there are several times i have gone 2 days of use before running the battery low.as for the camera. i love the interface and the optical quality for a cell phone is astounding. even zoomed in the pictures maintain a fair level of quality. as opposed to my past phones that would zoom but produced images that resembled impressionist paintings. the portraits of people and snapshots of random things always please. I cannot wait till the northern lights are visible here in the Alaskan skies.I will however retain my dslr equipment for the money shots....I caught this on sale for $699 which is the most i have paid for a cell phone ever.I love the freedom I have from the control of the famous fruit company phone, and the huge cost they sell their new model for... ouchfor me it was a big step up from the Blu phones, which I last bought the F91 5G is no slouch the camera couldnt do well in low light, but to its advantage it was fast, and i have a 512GB Mico SD on top of the 256 internal. at $199 (Sale price ) but the camera sucked. so i GEEKED out and use both cell phones for different uses.Thats all I can say for now.all the best to you and good luck",

                "reviewText": "It is an amazing device. I liked the back part material since it does not leave fingerprints marked. It runs properly and android version up-to-date. Battery works just fine; it will last for a whole day without any problem. In around 25 minutes is completely charged, so it is really good in case of an emergency. I love the camera, really good quality and pictures are outstanding. The only negative part is that it doesn't bring a case, so make sure you order one once you buy the device. I bought the 16 GB version, and totally worth it!",

                "reviewText": "This is a great phone overall. The hardware is well built and the screen resolution is excellent QHD quality. My user experience is so far very smooth and phone is very fast with no lag or glitches at all . The software is light yet feature packed with near stock android experienceThe fast charging is the main selling point and I found it very helpful and saves my time when I need to go out I plug it and go take shower , dress up and by the time I'm ready it's fully charged.Some falks talk about their need of wireless charging! And I really don't understand the hype . I would rather have super fast wire charge than throwing the phone on charging mat and watching it slowly charge.The Snapdragon Gen 2 processor is a real performer and 16gb ram which is extendable helped with excellent multitasking.The 256 GB storage is okay, If I want more space I can just store my files on cloud.The design is nice and different, I got the matte black color and used a Tudia case which fitted very nice and is very protective. This is my first curved edge phone so I am trying to get used to the feel of it.The phone has nice size and easy to hold in the hand . The rear camera delivers nice photos but the front-facing cam adds this unnatural tone to faces and it's 1080p so that is something I didn't like .Some reported issues with the Android Auto app and I was concerned but I didn't experience any of that , it connected to my car with full functionality.Overall this phone provides the best value for your money and I am happy with my purchase.",
