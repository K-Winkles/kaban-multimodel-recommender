                "reviewText": "I bought two phones from this company at the same time and both don't work properly. I wanted a Galaxy S 2. No one was selling this phone. So, I upgraded to the Galaxy S 4. I specifically was looking for a T-Mobile device that was unlocked. This seller said this phone was unlocked for all carriers. When the phone arrived it was an AT&T phone. This was a bummer. I waited for the phone to arrive only to see it was an AT&T phone. The seller did not list this on Amazon as an AT&T phone. Usually if the phone is an AT&T phone or Verizon or T-Mobile or whomever the seller will list that so the buyer will know. This seller deliberately hid the brand type of this phone.I thought since the seller listed the phone as unlocked and said that it would work with any carrier it still might work. Nope. I promptly took it to a T-Mobile store, and they said it would not work with T-Mobile only AT&T. They went on to say the phone was not unlocked. Now this is the second phone that I have bought from Warehouse Wireless and they are both paper weights. I could not even get on the google playstore or google one drive on this Galaxy s4! Regardless of the carrier one should still be able to connect to the internet and get on google play or one drive. It kept saying I couldn't sign in. All you need is an internet connection to sign in which I had. It did allow me to go to other websites but not log into any accounts. I have only had this phone a week and it is trash unusable. The seller really should have been honest and let the buyer know that this was a AT&T phone. Who wants to send it back look all over again and have to buy another phone and hope they don't get burned by a different seller. I have already been burned twice by buying two different phones from this seller.",

                "reviewText": "Ordered 2 of these phones. One works perfectly, the other not so much. It tells me constantly that it cannot detect the sim card and has to restart. 5 minutes later, at the most, it does the same thing. It repeats this over and over until I remove the sim card and put it back in. It loses signal constantly while my husband, who has the other phone I ordered and the same service, works just fine. Then last night I plug it into the charger and it tells me disconnected battery. It did this over and over until I took the battery out and put it back in. I've contacted them today about returning it. I want to exchange the phone but all they offer is for you to get a refund. So I'm going to have to mail it back to them, wait at least 3 days for them to process the refund, then turn around and order a new phone and wait for it to be shipped. I hope I'm also refunded for the expedite shipping I paid!",
