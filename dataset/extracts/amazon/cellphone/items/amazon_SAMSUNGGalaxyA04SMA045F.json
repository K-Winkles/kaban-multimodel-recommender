                "reviewText": "I've always used a Samsung Galaxy as a primary cellphone and have been through about 5. I needed a new phone immediately after being cut off unexpectedly from the Lifeline phone program. The Galaxy I've been using (an A01) is 3 1/2 years old, has always been a bit glitchy, only has a 3000mAh battery, and has left me scrambling for app space.This is a large phone that's almost an inch longer and several millimeters wider than my current A01 - and that's without a case. As a woman with small hands I'm often struggling to hold onto it. Its size makes it awkward to carry and to fit in a pocket or purse but it needs a case so a kickstand type will at least allow me to slip the back ring on a finger for better security when using it. This is an international phone so it comes with a European plug for charging and the seller includes a separate standard plug for U.S. outlets.I've been using a spare Samsung plug with the cable, and it's a lot slower to charge than my A01. The standard 5000mAh battery works well. The buttons on the phone to turn it on and adjust the volume are both on the right hand side and take a bit of getting used to. It updates quickly and doesn't appear to install too much junk but I have had to uninstall the Spotify app (which it comes with) at least 3 times, so there are some glitches. Glitches are a Galaxy phone issue and to be expected.I turned off notifications for weather and still get them. Some of the bells and whistles include features which allow a child to use it with restrictions, facial recognition, the ability to save while you edit a photo, a radio feature that can be used with headphones, etc... The phone takes good photos and there's not been any gaming issues with apps. You can't beat the price for the features. I wouldn't buy this gigantic phone again, but would buy from this seller again.",
