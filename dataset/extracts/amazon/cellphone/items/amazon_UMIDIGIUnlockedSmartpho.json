                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I was in the market for a new budget phone to use as a back up to my daily driver, and just general use from time to time (I like to move between two or three phones during any given week). It often happens that my back up phone will eventually end up as the daily driver for my wife or one of my kids (my wife took my UMIDIGI Bison GT2 5G from me and used it until her recent upgrade. lol). Given this path of events, I've had the opportunity to use many phones including a few Umidigi ones, and I've really liked most of them in general, but I have a soft spot for Umidigi products as they tend to offer good value for money. At least that has been my experience. As such, the coupon that was available at my time of purchase was the clincher in my final decision to buy the Umidigi G3 Plus, well that and the lavender color. lol. I'm happy I did.I've been using it for about a month now and while it isn't as great as my Sony Xperia 1 IV (my daily driver most of the time), it also is about $1,300 dollars cheaper. Given the difference in price, you'd think I would just be running back to my Sony and leaving the G3 Plus in the drawer awaiting the call as a back up phone should catastrophe occur, but that wasn't the case. The G3 Plus is very impressive for it's price ($120 bucks, give or take), and I've not really had any issues doing everything I generally do, so it has taken it's place in my phone rotation and I use it two or three days a week. If it was the only phone I could afford, I would be very happy to use it as a daily driver.Pros are a solid build quality, competent performance in video playback, web browsing and gaming. Love the lavender color and the nice, heavy feel of the phone. It feels like it should cost much more than it does. The back is a faux leather like texture. Sure, it is plastic, but it doesn't feel like it's cheap. It feels very high quality. No issues with web browsing or watching youtube or streaming apps. I used Netflix, Prime and Crunchyroll without any issues. I do some gaming from time to time and was able to run all my usual games (Asphalt 9, Final Fantasy, etc) at a competent frame rate and graphical level. Had some issues with Retro Bowl Football but I also have some issues running that on my Motorola Razr 5G too so that may have more to do with the game than anything else. The G3 Plus comes with Android 13, and includes a clear phone case and a charging cable and charging brick in the box, unlike other companies like Apple and Samsung that over charge and under deliver. Following in that vein, the G3 Plus also has other features you don't find much anymore, like a 3.5 mm headphone jack and expandable memory (up to 1TB). This makes up for the limited amount of onboard memory that it comes with (128 GB). The 6.5\" screen is competent, if not amazing. It is only 60 hz refresh rate, but again, this is a budget phone, so that's not a negative by any means and the screen handles everything it needs to do just fine. The battery is large, 5150 mAH, so it goes a long time between charges, which is good since it doesn't set any speed records while charging. When the battery lasts this long, charge speed being a little slow is kind of irrelevant though. I also like the pictures that are produced by the 16 megapixel main camera. They are not the best money can buy, but for the price this cell phone costs, they are impressive. There is also an 8 megapixel selfie camera that does a good job. It also has a side mounted fingerprint sensor like my Sony Xperia 1 IV. I love that implementation of the fingerprint sensor.As for complaints, it is hard to have many given the price. I'd have preferred it have more the 4GB of memory, but I understand why this is the amount the G3 Plus has. Battery charge speed could be a little faster, especially given the huge size of the battery.So after one month of substantial use, I'm really happy with the Umidigi G3 Plus. It's way too early to comment on long term quality, but as of right now it really feels much more expense than it actually is. Great build quality, surprisingly good performance and increasing rare features like expandable memory and a headphone jack really make the G3 Plus a strong contender for bank for your buck king. This one will be in phone rotation for the foreseeable future and I feel confident it recommending it to anyone looking for a phone in this price range. It is definitely one of the best budget phones, if not the absolute best budget phone, that I've used recently. Highly recommended! Especially the lavender one.",

                "reviewText": "I used this phone for a few days and while it\u2019s it the highest of quality. For a spare phone, a phone for your parents who aren\u2019t used to technology, or even a kids first phone this will work for you. The phone is reasonably responsive I didn\u2019t feel like it was stuttering while using it. Now while this it not a phone worth 1k or more there are a lot of things going for it. The battery is huge and lasts for days on end as a simple user for messages, web browsing, etc. now I would not recommend this to the heavy user for gaming and other things. But for what you\u2019re paying this phone is a good grab. I\u2019d highly recommend this phone for the quality and price you are paying plus you even get a screen protector and a case included and installed. No having to fuss over going out to purchase those right away or raven worrying if the screen protector will go on correctly. This phone is a must if you just need something cheap and reasonable for you to use daily for a little while. I\u2019m not sure how the support would go for this over time but already having android 13is great with the new customization options and full features from android it\u2019s a great grab for someone not looking to break the bank. While this phone doesn\u2019t compete with high end models you are getting a way bigger battery for the phone and pretty much the same software features if you\u2019re looking for a phone to play the newest games or take the best pictures I\u2019d say this isn\u2019t for you and spend more money on a different phone but if you need a phone just for daily use calling text and the basics this could be the one for a small price.",

                "reviewText": "A few weeks back, I was looking for an inexpensive unlocked phone for travel. Pressed for time and options, I landed on the Umidigi G3 Plus. I\u2019m very glad I did. At roughly $120, the G3 Plus is an excellent value for the money, and dare I say enough phone for most people.Unboxing ImpressionsThe UMIDIGI G3 is made out of a hard plastic with a subtle leather pattern on the back. I found the included TPU case to be nice and grippy. Speaking of accessories, the G3 comes with a 5W charger and cable, a SIM removal tool, and a pre-installed screen protector. As everyone knows, Apple, Samsung, or Google don\u2019t go in for creature comforts like these nowadays. The fact that UMIDIGI did at this price point is nothing short of amazing.Hardware FeaturesLet\u2019s be honest \u2013 the UMIDIGI G3 is a substantial phone. The screen is a massive 6.52\u2019\u2019 IPS HD+ affair. It caps out at 720 x 1600 pixels with an immersive 20:9 aspect ratio. It isn\u2019t the brightest, but I found it to be visible enough in direct sunlight with good viewing angles. Up top is the endangered 3.5mm jack, which plays nicely with low impedance IEM\u2019s. There is a single down firing speaker on the base of the phone, next to a USB-C port with USB 2.0 speeds that provides 10W charging. On the right are the traditional volume buttons and a power button which doubles as a fingerprint reader. The fingerprint reader, I\u2019m happy to say, is splendidly fast and accurate. Seriously. It\u2019s my favorite part of the phone.Daily UseIn day to day use, this phone shines. Many of the services we take for granted in the US, from Google\u2019s suite of apps to T-Mobile\u2019s VoLTE protocol work perfectly. In my testing, Netflix, Prime, and Criterion all played in full HD and looked good doing it. The phone is free of bloatware, and applications can be easily changed to suit your fancy. I found that the G3\u2019s Unisoc T606 breezed through emails, web searches, and a quick game of Minecraft. While there are certainly faster chips out there, the T606 struck me as surprisingly capable. The only thing this phone doesn\u2019t have is NFC or wireless charging, though I confess that I haven\u2019t missed it very much at all.CamerasThe cameras are about what you\u2019d expect for a phone of this caliber. The main camera system consists of a 16 megapixel camera which is reinforced by a 2 megapixel camera for depth detection. The portrait mode works well enough, even with curly hair, though it can be a bit aggressive. The camera app also features a fairly comprehensive Pro mode, which gives you access to a host of manual settings. On the face of the G3, you\u2019ll find a single droplet style camera which easily bests the upper-tier laptop camera of my M2 MacBook Pro. If the camera is important to you, the UMIDIGI G3 Max might be your best bet at just $10 more.Conclusion and Final ThoughtsIt must be said \u2013 the UMIDIGI G3 Plus seriously impressed me. If you need an inexpensive phone for whatever reason, this is a great choice. Here are a couple of quick thoughts that I couldn't jam elsewhere in the review:- The G3 has the ability to use 4GB of the ROM as swap for the memory. I didn't really notice a difference in performance, but it's nice to have it as an option.- WiFi, cellular, and Bluetooth (tested with my Qudelix 5k) worked well.- Umidigi seems to have built their own updater which lives in the About Phone section in the Android settings.- I scratched the screen protector fairly quickly, so be careful with keys in your pocket.TL,DRPros:Unbelievable price to performance ratioStock Android 13 with no bloatwareGood enough cameraFast fingerprint readerCons:No NFC or wireless chargingThe G3 Max offers a better screen and camera for just $10 more",

For the price, you can't expect a flagship phone. But I am really impressed at what you get. First thing that I like the most is that it is pure stock Android 13 with no bloatware whatsoever. The screen is large and bright. It's very lightweight but seems sturdy enough to stand up to day to day use. It comes with a large 5150mah battery that easily got me through a full day of pretty heavy use. It even comes with the charging adapter in the box. Another nice touch is it also comes with a clear protective case. It even has a fingerprint reader and face ID that is quite responsive. 4gb of RAM helps keep it speedy enough, but as I mentioned, for the price you shouldn't expect state of the art ultra rapid responsiveness. It even has the ability to either use a dual SIM or to expand the storage up to 1TB. I also appreciate that it comes with the latest Bluetooth 5.0 technology. One more bonus I was not expecting is that it also comes with Google Personal Safety, which is fantastic because my mom can use this to let me and or my brother know where she is and if she should ever need any help in an emergency. For a budget phone, the camera is more than adequate in bright light. I think this is going to be the ideal budget phone for my mom's needs.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I would say this is a 4.5 star phone. I also note that I have not spent weeks with it yet, these are initial impressions.Overall this is a solid phone and performs very well for the price point. This is not top of the line ~$1000+ flagship phone, but performs well and lives up to its specifications. Importantly, the Android on it seems to be vanilla, there does not seem to be any extra bloat software from the manufacturer as sometimes happens with Android phones in this category (I have had a few different brands of Android phone and some were much much worse in this respect).I ordered this phone on Amazon Prime day so it had a good sale price. These are thoughts after first opening it up and testing it out a bit.The phone comes with a screen protector pre-installed, which is great. It also includes a clear plastic protective case, also very much appreciated. My main phone is an LG G8X ThinQ, so my main comparison point is against this phone.The phone is about the same size and feel as my LG smartphone. The construction feels solid. Both my main phone and this one are a bit on the heavier side, but you get that with most of the phones with a 6.5\" screen I expect. This G3 is 192g in spec and that feels about right.The startup happens smooth and quick. Initial setup took place fairly quickly and seemed intuitive. The phone comes pre-installed with the April 2023 version of Android 13, and quickly asked to download a more current update (all standard experience so far on that front). It will pull your apps and data from your google account when you do the initial setup. My other phone is Android 12 so I am not sure if some of the differences are just because of Android versions. It seems to have vanilla Android, so no bloatware that I could see.The fingerprint scanner works well. It lets me in on the first try easily.I use Public Mobile in Alberta, Canada, and it handles my SIM card fine. There is space for 1 SIM and one SD card, or two SIM cards. Test calls in sending and receiving worked well. I have not tested 2 sim cards yet, but the instructions cover this so I expect it to work fine (you can choose one, or have a dual receiving mode where calls to both sims will work but you need to change the setting to make an outgoing call)I have not yet really tested the battery life out. It came charged at 98%, quickly charged to 100% and is still at 100% after playing around with it for a while. It is rated to have a 5150 mAh battery and I expect that will be quite functional for most people. The compromise on this is that the phone is a bit heavier because it has this large battery in it.The settings and main operation all seem normal.The front and rear cameras both are very nice. Pictures are high quality and the camera has several features (I imagine all Android phones have this now).There are some features I haven't really tested much yet but overall this is a solid phone for the price and I am very happy with it.",
