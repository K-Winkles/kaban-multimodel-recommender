Carbon fiber is a good material choice for the back & sides of a smartphone. carbon fiber is a strong material.conveniencelike the convenience of dual sim & micro-SD card slot in the SIM tray. I am surprised to see a Chinese/UK smartphone in the u.s.a,the phones of that kind are usually built in a chinese sim reader in to a modular sim reader phone (like the iPhone 10 & 12), or found in China & and regions they are sharing with. on the note of that...i am considering swapping in the example models referenced above swapping in a chinese sim reader in place of a u.s one. the convenience of software upgrades by Samsung helps also. The A03 core has a lot of helpful features and loads of screen brightness for the phone it is. My favorite features being adaptive standby. The android 12 upgrade keeps user data conveniently, just adds the traditional samsung software to the phone. The phone also has a headphone jack, that is also a really helpful feat i found, though also very helpful it does run better on the cellular connection, WIFI is well worn.downsidesdoesn't have screen casting software preinstalled even in the android 12 upgrade. heats up ALOT in a case, don't recommend the phone in a case. connection does tend to degrade over time on newer samsung phones, I think it is just their design because my s20 has degrading cell connection also. why did they ditch the old antenna design on samsung phones? The older antenna design was so much more reliable.if you are getting worse issues than me, then it is a bad batch from the sellerexpected issues with newer samsung phones (it is still usable w/these issues)-slower Wi-Fi/cellularother problems that are worse-not doing POST (power on self-test)-locked to a SIM carrier-not running on battery power-app crashesissues that can be worked around (any repair associated step requires the correct tools)-phone in download modefix:1.set it out of download mode or2.flash the OS on the phone (recommend this route for security & mindfulness of the previous owner)steps for option 1-follow on screen instructions to reboot the phone out of download modesteps for option 2-connect your phone to a windows or macOS computer-download the right OS version for the phone (make sure the binary version is correct or it will not flash)-find a software to flash the phone with (you don't have to populate the user data section)-select the option to flash the OS-load the correspondent folders to the sections they belong-flash the OS & wait for a setup screen-set up the phone & test functionalityno POST-repair a short (the screen can sometimes cause this, sometimes a shorted a part on the board)locked to SIM carrier-find a website or carrier to unlock the phone-put a SIM card in it-enter a code given or let the carrier do itnot running on battery power1.replace the batterysteps-remove the screen/midframe (use repair guide to assist in this step and further ones)-locate & disconnect the battery (if one in there)-find a working battery replacement (I wouldn't trust eBay on this unless you have sellers there you trust)-install the battery-test the phone without sticking in any parts (if it doesn't work, repeat steps starting from locating and disconnecting the battery)-install the parts w/ adhesive-test the battery long term-use the phoneapp crashes-remove the screen/midframe (use repair guide to assist in this step and other ones)-disconnect all connectors from the motherboard (start w/ the battery)-remove all screws fastening the motherboard in place-remove the motherboard-find working replacement (I wouldn't trust eBay on this unless you have sellers there you trust)-install motherboard screws (know what screw goes where to prevent long screw damage)-plug in all connectors (ending with the battery)-test all parts of the device (try reseating connectors first (make sure there is no dirt or misalignment in the connection, unplug battery first, and plug in battery last) if issue occurs then, remove & replace motherboard if any part isn't working)-use the device",

FreedomPop which is also merged with red pocket Just a little bit of information freedompop and red pocket are the same company that are piggybacking on AT&t' network which is a GSM network. This phone claimed that it was internationally unlocked and was a GSM phone but for some reason I'm seeing complaints that it's not working for every GSM Sim network.Please Amazon get your sellers to give the proper information it's very frustrating when supposedly something supposed to work and it doesn't. So just to make this statement clear I am not shopping on Amazon for cell phones ever again it is not worth it's better to walking to any cell phone store and buy it from them because this is ridiculous.",
