She can barely operate the house phone and there are too many telemarketers calling. It was too much money every month just to be harrassed by spammers. After looking all over the place, this phone seemed good with less features and big easy to use buttons for simplicity when calling. Everything else I looked at was too complicated for her. What ever happened to simple phones for elderly people? Well, this phone really turned out to be way too small. The big buttons aren't that big when you realize how small the phone is. After a few weeks, the thing just stopped working. When powered all the way up, just unplug it and it is dead as a door nail. It is garbage. Useless garbage. Why can't anyone just make a simple, easy to use cell phone for seniors? Stop with all the bells and whistles.",

The battery life does last pretty long, but one drop and it will stop working properly. I did not find any phone case for this phone to prevent this issue. I tried to contact tech support but I did not receive any reply, so I bought a second phone, and find my Aunt hit the wrong button and the SOS feature sent off. I would say overall its a cheap phone in cost, but my Aunt did get 6 months out of the phone and for me that was a win.",
