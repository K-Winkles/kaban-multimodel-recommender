There is no wireless charging, but that isn't a big deal. There's no SD card slot. I think you get around 300 gigs built in. Picture quality is good! I don't use it right now, Other than to test my Gimble an done. So I do not know about the sound (talk) quality or signal strengths. Wireless and everything else has been working fine!
