Seller was attentive, sending product information for start up and phone is easy to use. If you need a cheap phone that will do the job as well as your current android but won't be heartbroken if you lose it, this is your product. The phone is completely customizable, from home screen, to navigation bar, screen gestures, apps, and quick search. Camera quality is great, including different picture modes. Battery is long lasting, set up is simple and the phone itself feels sturdy and well made. Screen sensitivity is very good and there is no touch delay or glitching. I haven't had it long, so I can't say much on long term wear and tear, but overall I'll still give this 5 stars until something goes wrong.",

A tech support from the network says the phone has a voice restriction since I was able to send texts and get data but unable to make calls. I'm not sure if this applies to other companies but for Hello Mobile, it certainly did not work. If you're buying this, be cautious about making a full transition of apps and personal info before verifying it works. I wasted two days with this. Returned.",

If I could SEE a tree it would drop connection ect. I wanted to like it. I wanted to buy it as a spare phone to be replaced in less than 6 months. The connection issues suck on this phone. The battery life was amazing. I understand its just a cheap phone but I honestly think on the hardware side they cheaped out on the modem/transmitter. Now this could be just my experience with this specific phone but I got a feeling its not just me. My plan was to buy this phone and then upgrade to the new F3 5G in a few months making this a spare for just in case. Having to deal with Umidigi Was not a fun experience. From only getting emails between 4-5:30 AM to wanting me to provide a video of dropped connections to only wanting me to email them directly and not involve Amazon this just all put a bad taste in my mouth. Umidigi you let me down and I had no choice than to but a phone from someone else. Do better Umidigi",

I made sure to download all updates to the operating system of the phone and the apps(google translate, Whats App, etc) that I would need using Wi-Fi.The picture/video quality seemed good but in my opinion iPhone 14 seems to take a better picture/video.Not sure if this is normal but when turning on the phone took a long time to get to the main screen. Once it\u2019s on though it operated fairly quick and smooth.I would recommended this to a friend.",
