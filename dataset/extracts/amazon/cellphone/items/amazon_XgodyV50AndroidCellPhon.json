                "reviewText": "Considering the low cost, those phone seems really good value! I am actually quite impressed. The camera in particular is quite decent - it won't great Google, iPhone or Sony of course but for the price it is better than I expected - crisp, clear photos with decent stabilization on both front and rear cam. It does not have the same level of processing that branded phones do though of course, so the digital zoom is pretty terrible and photos in low light conditions are grainy, dark and blurry.Connectivity is not bad, I've had a stable phone connection so far with no issues in call dropping or interference. It only has 4G connectivity though, no 5G.Overall, if you're between phones right now or are looking for a cheaper alternative phone to take with you to festivals and concerts save risking your brand new flagship phone, this one would be a great option as the camera is pretty decent, the battery life is good and you can't beat the value",

                "reviewText": "For much of the UK 5g is not an option, so why not just use a great value 4g phone? This is great as a backup phone. I often go out walking in horrible conditions and wouldn't want to lose or damage my up to date branded phone. Using this as a backup is reassuring. It isn't the fastest phone, but for maps, social networking, and taking pictures it is fine. Good battery life, not overly large or heavy, this phone is great to take outside, or for a messy night out. The screen is bright, crisp, and very clear. The camera is great for everyday photos. For under 70 this sim free unlocked phone is a no brainer choice. Impressed and very pleased with it.",

                "reviewText": "The Xgody V50 piqued my interest primarily because of its enticingly competitive price, especially when compared to other flagship models. Given its price bracket, my expectations were modest. Upon receiving the phone, the design and build were eerily reminiscent of my Samsung Galaxy S21. It's undeniable that Xgody has taken design cues from premium phones, a move that elevates the V50\u2019s aesthetic appeal, making it look more upscale than its price suggests.Delving deeper into its features, I was generally pleased. The camera functionality, particularly the clarity of the pictures and videos, was a standout. The photos captured were crisp, and videos maintained a decent level of stability. Call quality was consistent with clear audibility, and messaging was seamless. The internet connectivity was swift, enabling smooth browsing and streaming, a feature often compromised in budget smartphones.However, the V50 wasn\u2019t without its minor hitches. While the design mimicked premium phones, the feel in hand did betray its budget nature. The body, though sleek, felt a tad plasticky, lacking the heft and premium touch of its more expensive counterparts. Moreover, while the Android 10 system offered a stable experience, occasional lags were noticeable, especially when multitasking or running heavy apps.The battery performance, on the other hand, was commendable. Even with rigorous usage, it consistently lasted more than a day, putting some flagship models to shame. The charging, though not the fastest, was adequately quick, ensuring you're not tethered to the charger for too long.In conclusion, the Xgody V50 is a mixed bag of impressive features and some shortcomings. For its price, it's undeniably a steal, offering functionalities that are usually reserved for higher-priced phones. It's an ideal choice for those who want a decent smartphone experience without breaking the bank. While it might not replace a flagship for those accustomed to premium experiences, it's a worthy contender in the budget segment.Thank you for reading my honest review, I hope you found it helpful! :)",

                "reviewText": "At first glance, this is a nice-looking Android phone with a stylish finish and reasonable screen. For the money - I think it was \u00a369 when I received it - it certainly represents good value, but don't expect anything more than adequate performance.The screen quality and brightness are reasonable (7/10), and it's certainly good enough to watch YouTube, play undemanding games on, browse the internet/read emails, etc.The phone is sluggish when you try to carry out certain tasks - trying to take a photo is nothing short of painful, and the quality of the photos - even in good light - is poor compared to high-end phones, but at as much as 1/20th of the price, you should expect that - see example photo, attached.More demanding games are unplayable on this, but slower games are okay - Candy Crush performs pretty well, for example.The battery life is good - it will last about 3 or 4 days on standby.The phone appears to be stuck on Android 10, which is 4 years old and is now considered \"end of life\", with the final update being released in February 2023, so I wouldn't recommend using this as your primary phone with all your personal details on it, but it's probably okay as a backup phone in emergencies or as a phone for a younger child who won't have any personal data stored on it.Speaking of security, since setting up this phone, I've had a few text message one-time password verifications relating to resetting Telegram, Microsoft, Freelancer, Amazon and Paypal accounts (one in Italian) - and I don't even have accounts for all of these services, but I'm not sure if that relates to the phone number I'm using - a separate number on a basic package or the accounts I've connected to the phone - again, not my main email account, to be safe, so I will reserve judgement for the time being. I've installed MalwareBytes Pro and done a full scan, which has brought up nothing. Though I confess, I did wonder if this related to the phone itself, but I can't see anything to indicate that's the cause of this issue.Overall, it's a basic phone, fine for a non-power user, as it will carry out non-demanding tasks adequately, but it wouldn't be my first choice of phone unless I was on a restricted budget.",

Huge screen, Android 10 OS, 13MP camera, 2 sim cards, 4GB internal memory and you can still expand it.Yes, of course, it is not as fast as the latest smartphones in \u00a3300+ range but common - that's a very unfair comparison.I am actually quite impressed and also angry at the same time since I started realizing how much we pay for the brand name only.Anyway, I won't be using it myself but as said before - great first smartphone and not huge loss if say broken, lost or stolen.",
