The battery health was at 84%, better than I had expected and definitely more than enough for me to work a whole day on one charge. Some slight wear on the camera but to be expected of a renewed device. You do have to keep in mind that every phone's condition is different. From my experience, even with Excellent quality, you can get significantly lower battery health (mid 70s), and it's all essentially up to chance. All in all it was a great purchase, I still use the phone, and the price and other benefits from Amazon make it a better idea than purchasing from some other refurbishing websites.",

                "reviewText": "This was was an upgrade purchase for my daughter. We don't believe in buying $1,000+ phones for teenagers. Amazon's Refurbished was a welcomed gift! The phone comes well packaged and is in great shape. It works like new, as promised! But, it took us MANY HOURS to finally get this phone set-up and info transfered over. Here are some learned tips for set-up: First, fully charge the new phone and your old phone. If possible, leave them both plugged in during the process. We learned that your old phone needs to be at least 50% charged before it will even start the transfer process. Don't bother backing up your old phone to the iCloud beforehand. It's much faster to wait and do that with the new phone after all is said and done. Your first step, go into the new phone and in Settings, go into General, then update the software to the latest version. We had many issues with the process stalling and then we would finally get an error message? This wasted a lot of time! It's so much quicker to update that software first, though it will take awhile (not lying). Once the software on the new phone is updated, then start the transfer process with your old phone. It will take a while (maybe 30 minutes). Once the whole thing transfers, your new phone will work and everything on the screen will look like your old phone. Here's the one thing we did not think about, you will still need a new SIM card from your Carrier. They are free. Simply go to your Carrier's store and explain that you bought a used phone and they will give you one. After everything is all set-up, call your carrier with your old phone and they will talk you through the process of installing the new SIM into the new phone. They will even test it out with you online until it works. Amazon Refurbished is guarranteed and definitally cheaper than other sites. The phone arrives fast too! After all is said and done, wipe the old phone to factory settings and remove the SIM card. Then you are all set! Newer phone at a cheaper price, it's guarranteed, and my daughter is totally happy with it!",

                "reviewText": "Update: May 23,2023I received the device in mid-November 2022 and by mid-May 2023, the device no longer works. During a phone call, my phone randomly reset and has not turned back on since. It is stuck on a reset loop. I have tried hard-resetting, letting the battery drain and charge back up, and upgrading the software through a computer, but nothing has worked.Buyer be cautious! The device may work during the 90 days you have eligible for return, but beyond the 3 months the seller and Amazon will not refund or replace the device.Do not purchase if you want a reliable and fully functional device with a warranty.--------------------------------------April 24, 20235 MONTH REVIEW:At first glance this was a good deal on an affordable refurbished iPhone 11 Pro. The device I received arrived in good packaging and no visible wear marks on the phone. Unfortunately, it quickly began to decline as far as the internal quality.The begin, the battery arrived at 85% max capacity, which is a measure of the battery capacity relative to when it was new. About 2 weeks into having the device, I noticed my phone wasn\u2019t retaining charge like my previous iPhone 11 Pro. I decided to disregard the issue as I believed it was just one small issue.About a month in, I began to have glitches in my device such as my screen freezing, my touch screen response being very delayed, and even audio issues. I would be on a phone call and people would say they couldn't hear me. This issue would persist until I reset my device. My phone also began to reset on its own. These issues occurred very little at first but now 5 months in they happen too often and it is frustrating to deal with. I sometimes have to force reset my device, which is really inconvenient when I\u2019m on a call or relying on GPS.I\u2019m only 5 months into owning the device and to add on to my list: I am now having issues with my front facing camera. I am getting an error saying my TrueDepth camera is having issues, and because of these issues I am unable to use the Face ID feature to unlock my phone or to log into certain apps.I have a quality case on my device, it has not been abused/dropped/exposed to harsh temperatures-just normal basic use. I use an official Apple charger and I\u2019m far from meeting storage capacity. The phone itself looks new, but I was sold a faulty phone.THINK TWICE about purchasing!!! The phone may look like it is good but the quality quickly declines. If you still decide to purchase the phone, return it in the first sign of an issue.",
