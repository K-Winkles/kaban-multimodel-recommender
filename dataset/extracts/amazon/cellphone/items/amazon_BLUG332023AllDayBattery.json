But less than 24 hours later, the thing crashes and requires a factory reset. GO through all those hoops Again and... it crashes asking for a factory reset. Nope, I had read the bad reviews on other sites and didn't listen. And my son had only downloaded YT for kids, so not anything complicated. Any smartphone on the market now in 2023 should easily be able to handle YT kids. I actually went to a different company and got a refurbished iPhone 7 (which is also what I use) and I am happy with that. But the Blu is terrible. ANd the company website has nothing to help with this phone at all, and ther ewere no YT videos to help either.",
