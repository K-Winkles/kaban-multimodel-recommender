The camera and display aren't that of a 1000 dollar phone but they are better than most phones at this price. If you want a phone with 2023 features and performance for under 200 This phone is perfect for you. The only downside is there was no USB charging block included but that is just the norm these days , so if you want a fast 20w charger you have to buy it separately.",

Uncomfortable to carry in shirt pocket. It also was unable to send or receive pictures within text messages. I did some research and I am not the only one that has had the texting problem. I was able to return the phone to Amazon for a refund. Do yourself a favor don't buy this model.",

                "reviewText": "I bought 2 to replace our galaxy A51's. Probably easy to operate because these are our 3rd galaxy phones. The camera & video recorder are superlative. To me it's worth it just for that. There are many more good features, but yeah, there is the bloatware. Over 400 apps are pre-installed. 2 things about that. 1. There are other apps superior to some of Samsung's I prefer & that I'm used to. 2. You can't get rid of the ones you don't like/won't use. That raises another problem because the A14 has only half the storage capacity of the A51. At the same time it irritates me that it's forever trying to put my non Samsung apps into deep sleep. It's crucial that some of them stay enabled. I play zero games, but whenever sam updates my phone they like to throw a couple in. Most of them are system apps otherwise.It threw me off to see it required a USBC to USBC cable and the special charging block didn't come with it. Fortunately my brother had an extra.",
