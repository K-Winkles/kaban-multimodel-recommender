Know this is a under average phone, and is by no means advanced. Camera quality is old, but functional and usable. Flashlight is bright. One thing that's funny is that the battery is literally heavier than the phone. Battery life is great. I bought this for my dad because he's unable to learn how to use a smartphone. I'll try to make a clip of it if I get around to it maybe during my Christmas vacation (2023). It's mostly a cheap plastic, but durable enough to bend and withstand a little careless use which is why i bought it.",

                "reviewText": "I was advised to purchase this specific phone by a T Mobile supervisor in Washington who was trying to get me NOT to leave T MObile. I had been searching for a very simple flip or brick style phone for my 85 year old parents. This BLU phone arrived with a lot of good press but NO INTRUCTION MANUAL. There was NOTHING online and I searched extensively, even going to the company website. No user manual existed anywhere for this phone. My poor elderly parents got so frustrated with the phone and the speaker, which was advertised as \"hearing aid compatible\" and oversized for seniors did not perform as promised. They could not hear well on it and between the 3 of us, we never located the speaker function, which would have at least allowed them to hear better. The phone indeed linked perfectly to T Mobile and it LOOKED good. However, it's ridiculous to sell any kind of electronic device without a user's manual. Even though the customer service folks at T MObile almost laugh at you if you ask about a flip phone, I'd like to say, for the record, that the elderly population in this country is huge and my parents are not unique. A smart phone is not what many folks want. And for manufacturers, as well as cell phone companies, to offer little or no decent products for these folks is simply bad business.",
