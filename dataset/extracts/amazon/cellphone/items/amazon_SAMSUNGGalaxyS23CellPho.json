                "reviewText": "I like both iPhones and Android phones for different reasons and keep both in the family. The Samsung S23 is the best Android phone I've ever used, and that includes recent offerings from OnePlus, Google, Motorola and LG.Having used both phablet-style phones and smaller devices, I find myself gravitating toward the smaller S23. For me, it's just easier to grip, lighter and much easier to put in a pocket.Usually you have to sacrifice something between either speed or battery life. I'm happy to say this phone is both super speedy and has fabulous battery life despite the smaller size of the battery compared to the phablets. I can easily get through a day of moderate to heavy use, up to two days if my usage is a bit lighter.The screen is the best I've used on any phone, including the latest iPhone 15 Pro. It just has a pop to it with vibrant colors that don't feel overdone. Samsung's Android customizations are excellent and very helpful overall. Some complain about software bloat on Samsung phones, but this unlocked version doesn't seem to be loaded down.I'm not a camera expert, but in casual use, I find the camera on the Samsung S23 to be right up there with the iPhone 15 Pro. They are both very high quality cameras. You won't be disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "I work in I.T. support and see too many issues with Apple products. I have had Samsung phones since around 2014. I have an S5, an S7 and S9. The S5 & S7 are retired now but still work. The S9 is still active on another line. All these have had \"normal\" lives, dropped now and then, survived spills and weather. It only made sense to move to the S23 series and I got this Ultra model mainly for the large screen to help with my old shaky hands. I used the Smart Switch app to move files from the S9 to this phone and it saved a ton of time. There are many manual things that need to be done to complete the switch but this worked well. This phone is awesome. The cameras are better than most of my stand alone digital cameras. The phone itself has great clarity and the cell and WiFi connections are very stable. 5G speeds are awesome but I normally don't play games or watch much video with this phone. All but a couple apps still work that transferred from the S9. A feature that I miss is the standard audio jack for headphones. Battery life on this phone is better than the S9, the wireless charging stations I already have work great and the display size is a major improvement for me and my clumsy hands. I highly recommend this phone.",

It is completely reliable and a great daily driver. Battery & charging was excellent, performance was superb, and One UI is now better than the stock Pixel launcher. I never had battery anxiety. It's a great phone to travel with or use for work. It's an overall excellent phone.I just exchanged it for a Pixel 8 Pro. The only reason that I switched is because I can't get behind Samsungs idea of picture quality. Many people like how they process pictures which is why I gave the phone a perfect score. I just like the Pixel's toned down and natural look better.",

                "reviewText": "Firstly I was pretty skeptical of purchasing an unlocked phone never owning one before but so far this device has been nothing but first class performance. The only issue I have had so far is with getting this masterpiece to do wifi calling, but I have this same problem with my Galaxy S20 Plus and was able to figure out how to get it working and I have high hopes that the same will happen here. I have tried the moon zoom and it was spectacular. I love the size of this phone though I wish Samsung had at least made it the same size as the Galaxy S22 Ultra which is 6.9 inches, but however I can still work with 6.8 inches. I love the bigger screen phones because they are better for conducting business on the go and of course videos, movies and photography. Love the brightness of the screen and need I not mention the S Pen which I always wanted. Though it's true that this phone is pretty expensive, still, all in all it's worth every single penny for everything thing that has been put into it including hours of labor and time. I didn't want to upgrade my Galaxy S20 Plus this soon, but after seeing the moon zoom and the fact that this phone featured the popular S Pen, I have no other choice but to dive in, besides life is too short to not have the things we work hard for, so with that said I pampered myself to this device that I hope to have for many years to come. I seen in the reviews where someone stated that the phone will not charge past 85 percent. Go to settings, battery and device care followed by battery and then more battery setting and turn off the protect battery setting if you want your device to charge the entire 100 percent. However keep in mind that keeping this setting turned on increase the life of your battery when it only charges to 85 percent. Sound quality has also improved once again in this device and that is something that I love as well. I guess the even better part is the updates that is going to hopefully follow to put the icing on the cake because, as far as the hardware..... it's all there. Samsung has even stepped up their game and threw in McAfee on this one, so with that said, I stepped mine's up as well and bought the package deal from McAfee that will protect up to 10 devices. People, you ain't going to get better than this. This phone is super fast. I'm going to miss the memory card slot but just like the headphones port, I'll get over it quickly for all that this phone packs, I say so long memory card slot, welcome home Galaxy S23 Ultra.Update: 5/28/23.After having this phone longer, I've discovered more about it. The Bluetooth feature in this device is much faster than the one on my S20 Plus. My Galaxy Watch now connects instantly, where in my S20 Plus it took a few seconds to connect. I have been loving this phone so much that I have decided to replace the original plastic S Pen that came with it with the aluminum one to do my own part of keeping high-end products matched up with high-end products as I did with the case, going with the Otterbox Defender series pro case for this baby. I've heard people mention having dropped calls on Samsung phones, however I have not experienced that in this device this far into ownership. The photo of the Cellular Tower I took using the camera on this phone was taken from about a mile and some change away and I was zoomed to around 30mm out of 100, just to give you a better idea of what the camera on this device can do. I am very tickle with the benchmark results of this device, very, very beautiful results. Still waiting to see what it will do with a full moon not to mention the very popular \"Super Moon\". After using this phone for nearly two months now I still must say that it has been an amazing experience. I have also noticed where some are unfairly reviewing the phone, either you have a defective device or is not doing something right. The battery should be no less than 5 stars, and I personally would give it 10 stars if I could for being a perfect 10. I have gotten at least 4 days out of my phone off a single charge, I have also noticed where the fingerprint scanner got an unfair low rating, again if you use it right it will work right. Since setting this area of the phone up I have not once had any problems with the fingerprint scanner picking up my fingerprint, even when I have done it snappy it has never failed to work. So far on this device, I have not experienced any of the dropped calls that I hear about since the very moment I inserted my sim card into this phone. At last, I was able to take a few photos of the popular supermoon. Wasn't that clear of an evening here but I still must say that the camera on this phone did an awesome job capturing it at 230mm and around 7mp.",

La c\u00e1mara toma fotos muy r\u00e1pidas.El tama\u00f1o compacto hace que quepa en cualquier lugar.El ecosistema Samsung es ideal.El celular lleg\u00f3 en su caja nueva sin violaci\u00f3n de los sellos.No se compren iPhone, es mejor este peque\u00f1o Samsung.",
