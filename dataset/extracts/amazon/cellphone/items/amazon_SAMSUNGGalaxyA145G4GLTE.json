                "reviewText": "This is the phone I really wanted! It has much better specs than the made for USA 64gb model; mainly the Exynos 1330 Chipset and the 128gb of internal storage. Long lasting 5000ma battery. This phone also includes a radio which the USA 64gb model does not. I added a 1tb microsd card for an awesome amount of storage. I also love the fact that it has a 3.5mm headphone jack to which I am able to insert and use a Shure SM58 dynamic microphone for recording videos. In order to use a dynamic microphone with your phone you have to purchase a Startech MUYHSMFF Headset Adapter W/ Microphone and Headphone Splitter. Best to order the Startech from someplace other than here because they sent the wrong cable three times in a row. Special thanks to unitblocks for their review of this particular Samsung A14 5G here on Amazon because the company that is listing the phone, MVD Mobile, has the wrong specs in their listing. Without the review of unitblocks I never would have found this phone here in the USA though I searched the internet extensively for this model which is Model SM-A146M. This model is made for Latin America. When you begin to set-up the phone it is set for Spanish but simply select English United States and you're good to go. Now for sale here on Amazon for $179.00 (as of July 3, 2023). I LOVE THIS PHONE! It has saved me hundreds of dollars over those mid-range phone offerings and provides features that some more expensive phones do not (headphone jack, radio, 128gb internal storage, microsd expansion).",

                "reviewText": "One of the biggest differences between this phone and the next few higher price phone from Samsung is the amount of memory. It is much cheaper to buy a micro SD memory card and put it right next to your SIM card than buy higher priced phones. It is easy to set high memory item like photos to go direct to the SD card. Plus when you want to print special photos it easier to do at home or at office supply stores and drug stores.",

                "reviewText": "The item arrived today and I spent hours configuring the phone.When I realized I need to charge the phone, I noticed that the USB-C cable (on both ends) doesn't work with the USB-A Charger that came with it.I am now stuck with a phone and no way to charge it.Amazon on offered me to return the product for a refund.I was hoping the seller can send me a proper charger for the phone. I hate to see the many hours spent setting up the phone wasted.The Good:-- Screen size pretty big, for those that like big screens.-- Display is sharp and nice on the eyes.-- SD card expansion is very nice, I can store all of the photos and music on it.-- Phone is fast enough for daily use, feels pretty smooth.The Bad:-- The Samsung brand charger that came with it feels very hot when charging the phone.-- The speaker is NOT LOUD enough. I was using the speaker to answer a call while driving and I cannot hear clearly what the person was saying.The camera quality is NOT as good as one might think from a 50 MP camera. It looks blurry in many photos I have taken. That is pretty much expected for a phone in this price range, that's why I didn't list it under \"The Bad\". For normal phone quality picture, I think it's ok.",
