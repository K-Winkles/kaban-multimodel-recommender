                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The description from the manufacturer make this phone out to be the miracle of all phones, but this is what they DON'T TELL YOU.1. Device does NOT ask for Google account when first starting to give you access to setting up the device.2. Device contains 512GB + 8GB, and an SD card slot upto 1T; however, you can use the SD card slot to store apps, app data, or photos, music, or videos, etc. automatically. You have to manually transfer your photos, videos, and other media to the SD card AND you CAN NOT use the SD card to store any apps or data from the apps. Basically, the SD Card slot is useless. That's why the device has 512GB internal.3. I have had to do 3 Factory Resets before figuring out a way to transfer some apps, some data, and very few settings to this device.4. You can NOT use Google 1 to setup your device.5. You can NOT use Samsung Smart Switch to setup the device since Smart Switch doesn't even recognize the device even if you have installed Smart Switch to the device.6. You can NOT setup the device from a backup from Google Drive or Samsung Cloud.7. The device says Android 13; however, it has icons from Apple's ITunes Application as the icon for the Google Play Store.8. Does NOT have new Google icons or Android settings such as GMail icon, Device Care to help you diagnose any problems with the device.9. I have found that if you do not live in a major city, your T-Mobile SIM card probably will not work; however, if you service through Tracfone but your service is using the GSM network for AT&T, it will connect to the AT&T network. It WILL NOT connect to the AT&T network if you have a SIM card & active service with AT&T since AT&T has blocked the use of unlocked devices from registering on their network. Contracts between Tracfone, its subsidiaries, & AT&T allow for service through Tracfone to connect with unlocked devices.10. After speaking at lengths with both Google & Samsung, both were at a loss of explanations as to why the device does not operate according to Android standards.11. To have 512GB + 8GB + OctaCore Snapdragon processor, this device is not fast at all. It moves very slowly.12. The ONLY way that I was able to transfer some data from my Samsung Android Galaxy was to download the AT&T Mobile Transfer app to the device; however, due to security settings by Google & AT&T certain apps and settings could not be transferred. I had to go into Google Play with ITunes Application icon and manually download my other apps.13. As you can see from the video in my review, this device is NOT worth the hard earned needed to buy it since the device is nowhere near a stable or decently working device.14. I have to do ANOTHER factory reset to get the device work semi-correctly, which means that I will lose ALL of the apps, app data, settings, and media that I was finally able to get onto the device. And trust me, it was a royal pain in the (guess where) to get all of the stuff onto the device in the first place.15. Save yourself some headaches and lots of stress and aggravation by purchasing a phone that does not sound like the \"can do it all\" device at a basement price. You will thank me for that advice because this device belongs underneath the basement in the foundation buried deeply in the cement or thrown off a bridge into a lake.16. But by all means, if you want to get back at someone or get even, then purchase this device for them. You'll love knowing they are miserable trying to get it to function.",

                "reviewText": "So it looks really good for what it is and for the price. It's a bit slow and the finger print sensor doesn't distinguish against different prints. One time it was not plugged in but said it was charging and the battery percentage actually went up until I restarted the phone. Really the only thing this phone is good for is a kid who wants an iPhone and a parent smart enough not to waste the money in an iPhone. It has a lot of storage (actually is there), the app store looks like the apple store until you click it and then it's Android. Overall not a bad device, didn't seem to over heat and didn't get so full of cache that it was at a snail speed unlike the real name brand phones I have given my kids in the past. We ended up switching providers to spectrum mobile and it was not compatible so it's just a gaming toy now.",

After investigating these imei are not registered with the fcc and cannot be activated on the t-mobile or metro pcs companies. Ad states it will work but doesn't. Refund process is horribly slow I sent it back right away and it's taken almost a month to get my refund. Do not buy this phone to use on t-mobile or metro and hope you don't need to return it. Very bad customer service policies or something",

I gave it a try based on the specs, and It was a HUGE mistake!Don't even know where to begin.....Right out of the box, it was horribly laggy, froze up three times in an hour. Thought maybe it was just updates slowing it down, but it never got better.It would only link up to old phone for a couple seconds, then disconnect every single time while trying to transfer data.The sound quality is crap! Sounds like a phone in a tin can and that's with the useless boost turned on.The flashlight/camera light is by far the dimmest, most useless light I've ever seen. Low light photos would never happen.You can't even get phone cases for it and the one they send is a thin piece of clear junk that wouldn't protect your phone if dropped on carpet let alone a hard surface.Even the sim/sd card tray didn't work properly.Save your money and time and purchase something better. I am returning this immediately!Amazon should pull this item!!",
