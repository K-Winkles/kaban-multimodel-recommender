                "reviewText": "This is an excellent phone. It just takes getting used to when you want to take a screenshot because when I use my Android 11, when I want to take a screenshot, the command to take a picture is right there. With Android 13, you have to press the power and Volume down button at the same time. Also, when you want to call someone, sometimes, the choice for the wrong phone number comes up. The fingerprint scanner takes longer to detect your fingerprint and is located very near the swipe up area so it keeps getting confused between the two. Also, the8x8 Work app doesn\u2019t work in this phone. One feature that is very hard to find that this phone has is it has room for 2 sims AND 1 TF card. Most phones say they have 2 sims but the 2nd sim is used for either a sim or a TF card. And the TF card can have a capacity of 1TB. It was those 2 features plus the price and the fact that it was Android 13 that convinced me to get this phone.Product Update: If you plug in a USB C adapter to use with a 3.5mm earphone, it won't work. If you plug in a USB C adapter that has charging and 3.5mm outlet for earphones only the charging part will work.",
