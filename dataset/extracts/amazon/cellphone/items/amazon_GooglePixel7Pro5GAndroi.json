It features the best Pixel camera yet, with a telephoto lens and pro-level features like Macro Focus, Cinematic Blur, and more. Plus, it\u2019s Pixel\u2019s most refined design, made with recycled materials.[20] LEGAL [1]Compared to Pixel 6. Speed and power efficiency claims based on internal testing on pre-production devices. [2]Works with all major carriers. 5G service is carrier dependent. Requires a 5G data plan (sold separately). 5G service not available on all carrier networks or in all areas. Contact carrier for details. 5G service, speed, and performance depend on many factors, including carrier network capabilities and signal strength. Actual results may vary. Some features not available in all areas. Data rates may apply. See g.co/pixel/networkinfo for info. [3]For \u201cover 24 hours\u201d: Estimated battery life based on testing using a median Pixel user battery usage profile across a mix of talk, data, standby, and use of other features. Average battery life during testing was approximately 31 hours. Battery testing conducted on a major carrier network. For \u201cUp to 72 hours\u201d: Estimated battery life based on testing using a median Pixel user battery usage profile across a mix of talk, data, standby, and use of limited other features that are default in Extreme Battery Saver mode (which disables various features including 5G connectivity). Battery testing conducted on a major carrier network. For both claims: Battery testing conducted in California in mid 2022 on pre-production hardware and software using default settings, except that, for the \u201cup to 72 hours\u201d claim only, Extreme Battery Saver mode was enabled. Battery life depends upon many factors and usage of certain features will decrease battery life. Actual battery life may be lower. [4]Measured diagonally; dimension may vary by configuration and manufacturing process. Not available for all apps or content. [5]Not available for all camera apps or modes. [6]Coming soon. Restrictions apply. Some data is not transmitted through VPN. Not available in all countries. All other Google One membership benefits sold separately.

[8]Designed to comply with dust and water protection rating IP68 under IEC standard 60529 when each device leaves the factory but the device is not water or dust proof. The accessories are not water or dust resistant. Water resistance and dust resistance are not permanent conditions and will diminish or be lost over time due to normal wear and tear, device repair, disassembly or damage. Dropping your device may result in loss of water/dust resistance. Liquid damage voids the warranty. See g.co/pixel/water for details. [9]Maximum resolution and field of view with RAW image files setting turned on. Setting is turned off by default. See g.co/pixel/photoediting for more information.

                "reviewText": "I've been with Verizon for years and always bought new phones through Verizon. This is my first unlocked phone purchase. I'm on a Verizon Family Plan and the plan for all lines was upgraded to a 5G Unlimited Data plan not long after 5G went live. I stuck with my 4G-LTE Moto Z2 Play until now when I pulled the trigger on this Google Pixel 7 Pro (512GB). The phone arrived at my door delivered by Amazon Prime next day. After I first turned on and set up the new Pixel 7 Pro I turned it off then I took the SIM card out of my old beat up Verizon Moto Z2 Play and I dropped it into the SIM slot of my new Google Pixel 7 Pro phone, turned the phone back on, and voil\u00e0! The phone immediately connected to 4G-LTE initially and I got frowny face, but about 3 minutes later it automatically switched and connected to 5G with 5 bars and I got big smiley face. It's been a solid 5G connection ever since. It was just that easy-peazy for me. The phone is snappy and responsive. Phone calls are crystal clear and sound amazing. The screen resolution and picture is fantastic. Super HD quality when watching 1080P or 4K. The speakers of the phone on speaker-phone sound fantastic, and the speakers sound fantastic even when listening to music or watching a video. The volume goes up very loud and it still sounds very good with little to no volume distortion (depending on the source audio). Bluetooth devices are pairing perfectly and without issues. So far, all the features of the phone work great. Security seems tight and the facial recognition and fingerprints work flawlessly thus far. The camera takes extremely good photos and video and even in very low light they come out very good. I'm trying to think of negatives and I can't really come up with any right now\u2014except maybe that there are a whole heckuva lot of settings of all kinds that you can adjust, which isn't really a negative at all, but it takes a long time to get it all dialed in on an unfamiliar phone. Security options are many which is a good thing. I'm very happy I pulled the trigger on this so far and I'm not quite sure what to make of the 'verified purchase' negative reviews because this Google Pixel 7 Pro rocks. I'll come back and change my rating if that changes.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars The smartest of the smartphones that you can get your hands on in 2023 so far",
                "reviewText": "\"I don't write many reviews, especially on Amazon, and I was initially skeptical about this phone. However, after using it for 14 days and learning how to make smart changes, I truly love it. I can confidently say that it is the smartest smartphone so far this year for the price you are paying.You may be wondering what excites me about this phone. First of all, you should expect some bugs, but Google is good at fixing them. There are always new features being introduced, and with new features come new bugs. So, what do I love and dislike about this phone?One of the things I love is the incredibly accurate dictation through speech, even with my accent. I have used Samsung phones for several years, and while they have a much sharper and darker contrast ratio than other Android phones, their software experience is not as good as Google's. In my opinion, the Pixel 7 Pro is self-learning and adapts to you. It also emphasizes the most important features of a phone - the phone and texting functions - which is something I missed with all the extra features and bloatware on Samsung phones. For example, even after just 10 days of learning how to optimize this phone, I have never been happier with a phone and it is such a joy to take with me everywhere. I have been dictating texts with no errors so far.The only things I don't like about this phone are the not as sharp screen compared to Samsung, and the Bluetooth quality is not as good. However, if you use adaptive sound, it improves the Bluetooth quality through your headset. Despite these minor issues, the additional features and ongoing support from Google make this phone well worth the price I paid. I did purchase a Samsung Z Fold 4, but now I have to sell it because this phone is so much more intuitive.When you buy this phone, make sure to spend an hour learning how to use it and making important changes before deciding if it is right for you. If you are looking for a simple phone with amazing functionality at a basic level - just phone and text - this is, in my opinion, the the best choice.\"",

The device is beautiful, I've been a Huawei user till the P30 pro that had Google services, and was terrified that this one wouldn't fit my needs but it delivered beyond expectations, two of the features I used the most are not in the operative system, the App lock and replicate app, which is sad because I love those features, aside that... a massive, incredible and resourceful device.I didn't rate de face recognition because I haven't even try it, it's just a feature I'm not a big fan of.",
