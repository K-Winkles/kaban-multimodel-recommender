Don't work with support or your service provider, just keep having them replace phones until things work. Trying to be nice and understanding got us burnt on this one.",

Lo prob\u00e9 con 2 SIM Movistar y no realiza ni recibe llamadas. Lo prob\u00e9 con SIM Telcel y funcion\u00f3 muy bien. Quiz\u00e1s sea incompatible con la red Movistar.",
