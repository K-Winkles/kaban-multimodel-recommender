I wish there was a way to contact the seller. I'll try to unlock it over the internet and see if it works for me. In any event, the A10E is the best IMHO. The more modern phones are like little suitcases and you can hardly take them anywhere. The A10E fits into any pocket and basically disappears there. UPDATE - I'm not paying to unlock the phone. Already bought a SIM card that won't activate.",

                "reviewText": "The Phone was in a factory package but upon opening it would not charge after many attempts it finally began to charge. So I began setting up the phone . Initially I was on WiFi so setup proceeded as expected, then I switched off WiFi and discovered that the phone was locked from att Sim use. I noticed that the phone was a tracphone so I contacted tfunlock and after 24 Hrs was able to unlock. But the phone would not work on data plan so I researched how to setup the APN settings to look like my other phone but they were greyed out. There were four options before a factory reset and on the forth I was able to force APN settings that worked with att but it was still using the VMNO setting that are forced on tracfone which delivers way weaker signal than my other phones about 20 dbm's which is significant signal loss. So thought ID contact the manufacturer. I connected the charger and attempted to continue setting up the next day but the phone has not recharged since and I have tried two different chargers and 3 different cords all of which work on my other phones.",

At first I was wary because of some reviews. finally it arrived with its charger and I put it directly to charge. as I hoped it was at 0% so I waited for 100% before turning it on and it worked normally until then. Im giving 3 stars cause I\u2019m just using it since 2days. hope it lasts long time.",

El celular es bueno para un uso muy tranquilo, ya que intentar jugar un juego o hacer algo que no sea usar redes sociales, hace que se vuelva muy lento, se atore e incluso llegue a crashear, es bueno para una emergencia pero no para un celular que se necesite para mucho uso constante. La pila le dura aproximadamente 13 horas considerando un uso moderado.",
