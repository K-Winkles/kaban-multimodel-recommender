The only things I find irritating is that the fingerprint sensor is right below the on/off button and the volume buttons right above that. If you're right handed, this sensor gets tripped all of the time, to the point where it gets disabled quite a few bit. Also, the comma is super close the the emoji button. Instead of commas when I'm typing, I'll open up the emoji screen. Oh, and it's hard to change screens from maps to anything else. Good phone, just little irritants.",

Just go ahead and buy this phone. What\u2019s more than that? Just the phone has four cameras and it even has a night mode. You can take any picture you want, any angel, under any circumstances. I just used this phone to play a game for a while, and what shocks me is that the gaming mode would give me a fantastic gaming experience. Please I never thought one day I would love one android phone better than any other android phone! For the first time, I thought my money is worth it!",

Don't need to worry the storage any more. The face ID, fingerprint function well, can unlock the phone very fast. Almost no waiting. The figureprint is on the right side of the phone, not under screen. But easy to use. It comes with a plastic screen protector (I did not install it very well), in case can not find fitted glass protector.",
