The screen was spotless. The hardware and software work seamlessly together. The processing power is very impressive. The camera is unbeatable for any phone manufactured up to the point this one was manufactured. This phone by far out does the newer Moto g I had purchased and was using this phone to replace.The only thing I do miss is the SD card slot, however, I have developed some understanding as to why a phone manufacturer might prefer not to have it. I have gotten used to managing my photos and videos using Google photos more effectively.I am 100% satisfied. I will continue to use this phone for quite some time so long as I can avoid damaging it of course. Anyone looking for an excellent quality phone with an amazing camera for a great price will definitely find it here.",

If I didn't know better, I thought it was brand new phone. Not a single scratch on the front screen, camera Lens, sides, corners or back. 100% perfect condition. Came with 65% charge. Brand new fast charger and USB-C cable and no directions but Samsung has the PDF file (G998U). Well packaged and protected in a generic cardboard box. For $392 bucks it was a good buy. My Excellent condition (Refurbished) was actually in Premium condition.Remember to NOT remove your OLD sim card from your OLD phone before calling to activate the new phone. It will delay the activation and you will have to start over if you chose to go that route.If I have any issues in the future I will update this review.I almost forgot. My phone came with 98% battery life remaining vise the 80% minimum promised as measured using the android AccuBattery app. You have to charge your phone to 100% and let it run down below 15% a few times for an accurate reading.Am very, very satisfied. Oh, was delivered 5 days early also. (insert smiley face here :)",

                "reviewText": "There were no pictures of the actual phone had a ding in the bottom corner and scratches on the screen! I started using it, I love the Samsung S21 Ultras, so I wanted to use it and keep, I noticed that it gets heat up in the warm weather and in my pocket sometimes, I did not think of it much then it started echoing and I did not notice this right away because I mostly used it on Bluetooth in my car or at home, when reached out to the seller for warranty, he said I have to send the phone back, I asked for a replacement not money back, I explained I can't because I need my phone for my work and I cannot be without a phone for 3 or 4 days why does not he do what other sellers do send the new phone and then I can send this one back, they refused, Amazon said no problem will get you a replacement or money back but they just stalled till Warranty was over now they deny the claim! This is horrible customer service!",
