                "reviewText": "Note that I don't have a use for NFC, which I *think* it doesn't have, and I don't use facial recognition, so I can't speak to that. And I don't play games on it. But everything I have used works great.Besides working fine, what else is there to say?First, the battery life is great -- I put it on a shelf to just be an alarm clock for 24 hours, and it used about 15% of the battery. Even with some web browsing and a lot of podcast listening during the day, I have never seen the battery below 45%, charging it once a day.The screen is bright and clear and big (for the phone's size), with refresh rate of 60Hz normally and 120Hz while scrolling (you can tell w/developer tools). There are better phone screens, but I never find myself wishing it were better. There is a black dot where the selfie camera is, but that's the price you pay for a wall-to-wall screen.The rear camera is 48M pixels, like the new Google Pixel phones. I don't know if it's actually as good, but if I want to do art photography, I don't use a phone. It has a separate macro lens that you can select easily with the camera app, and I have never had trouble getting a sharp photo of anything, yet. Like the screen, I've never wished it was better.The built-in speakers are unexpectedly good: there's one at each end, and, yeah, they do stereo as well as you can expect for speakers 4\" apart, I guess, but the sound quality and volume are significantly better than typical for reasonably-priced phones.The cell reception is better than the Pixel phones I've used, but, surprisingly, not as good as some Samsungs (cell reception used to be a real strong point for Moto).Unlike most top-tier phones, it has an SD card holder (as well as a physical micro-SIM holder). So you can add another half a terabyte (512GB) of storage for $20, if you like. Eat your heart out, iPhone users. According to Moto, it can take up to 1 TB (1024 GB).TL/DR: I would say this phone does everything well (of the things it does), without doing anything brilliantly, except battery life. For its middle-of-the road price, it's a VERY good choice.",

But I'm getting used to it now and really do like the larger screen size. For a sub $200 phone it is hard to beat.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this phone to upgrade from a moto play. This phone boasts a long battery life, but that simply isn't true. It last just as long, or short that is, as any other phone. So don't buy this phone if you think the battery is going to last two days, because it doesn't. With basic usage, sending text messages, talking on the phone, the average amount of web surfing, you'll find yourself plugging this phone in for a charge around 2PM. But what I REALLY don't like about thos phone is the volume. As far as phone's ringer and conversation volume, this phone has excellent volume. The volume for music too is good. But the volume for your notifications such as email, text messages, etc are EXTREMELY low. Even with the notifications tab turned up as high as it goes it's extremely soft. With my phone in my pocket I can't hear when I get a message. This is super annoying and have no idea why it's so low. I'm going to call Motorola to see what the deal is with this issue as none of my other moto phones has had this issue. If they tell me that's just how it is on the moto g 5g, I'll just have to send this phone back as it's a deal breaker for sure.",

The charging power cord that was included, doesn't work. It also didn't come with a plug either. He had to use a different USB-C cord that he uses for another device, to charge it up. I would just like to have the cord replaced with a better one. It would be nice to get a fast charging plug with it too.The only thing that he reported about the phone so far ( besides the power cord ), was that when he swipes to the 2nd screen, it makes a weird streak on the screen, which disappears. He is also disappointed in the lack of accessibility features, such as making the light flash when there's a text message, or phone call, there are other accessibility features that he said are missing, or not very easy to navigate.He's a bit disappointed in the fact that there's no dedicated e-mail app, except for Gmail.",
