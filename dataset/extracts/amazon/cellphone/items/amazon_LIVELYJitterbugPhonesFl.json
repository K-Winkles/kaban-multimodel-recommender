With buttons this big, even an accidental tap becomes a bold declaration. It's the touch of drama every phone call needs.The big, bold '0' button is practically an invitation for Grandma to press it whenever she wants to chat with someone. It's the 'Dial 0 for Sass' feature \u2013 because why wait for someone to call when you can take matters into your own hands?The Jitterbug keeps things simple \u2013 no confusing apps or fancy widgets. It's like a phone that went to a minimalist spa retreat. Want to make a call? There's a button for that. Want to send a text? There's a button for that too. It's like the Zen master of cell phones \u2013 serene and straightforward.The volume on this thing can wake the dead \u2013 or at least your neighbor three houses down. The 'Get Loud' feature ensures that Grandma won't miss a single word, even if she's in the midst of a bustling bingo game or a heated discussion about the good old days.",

Battery life reads 16 hours at full charge. Reached out to Lively for assistance, awaiting their response. Will update...As for the phone itself, it's replacing a \"rugged\" flip, so it seems a bit flimsy in comparison but may be fine for the light usage it'll receive. Can't expect too much for something at this price point. Wish there were models designed for seniors.",

                "reviewText": "The phone in general is fairly easy to use, which is why we purchased it for an elderly person. Unfortunately, the phone would not complete the initial update and installation.Customer service worked with us and when it could not be resolved over the Phone ordered a replacement phone and had it updated and sent to us. It worked fine out of the box and included a pre-paid return envelope for the original phone that did not work.This version of Jitterbug does not have a Touch Screen, so the rating of 1 Star.",

                "reviewText": "Total redesign - old EASY functionality gone.My dad has had a Jitterbug phone for years. He uses it to make PHONE CALLS. It is a flip phone!!! Some brilliant person decided this phone needed bells and whistles. After researching phones, we purchased the Jitterbug Flip Phone for my dad about 6-7 yrs ago.It had big buttons easy to see and dial.It was loud, call volume and ringtone.Super easy to use - extremely intuitive.Perfect for a senior - arthritis, neuropathy and hearing loss. (SENIORS this was their target market)NEW JITTERBUGSmaller buttons, but slightly raised. Volume seems ok so far. That for the most part is primarily what has stayed the same.I was assured the phone has speed dial it does not, Set-up info is in the manual but not a function the phone supports. The contact list is in alphabetical order- an improvement for some.All of the functionality of the original jitterbug is gone.Well, lots of info about texting from the phone; however, you are still texting from a flip phone.Connect to WIFI -you now have the ability to play \"wack-a-mole\".And the final waste of time and space ALEXA. Great for a home - not a flip phone.By the time you finish pairing Alexa with Lively and use the phrase \"Alexa ask Lively too...\"She can't text of make calls. Maybe I can use the combo of Alexa/Bluetooth for hands free calling while. driving. Looked at many combos - the answer is NO.This phone was fully charged 4 hrs ago - I have not made a call or done anything except scroll thru screens and the battery is at 91%. I had to put my glasses on to read that.And the promised coverage is 3 bars. I hope one of the perks they added is wifi calling.To wrap it up, I now have to teach my 80 yr old dad how to use this foolish phone so he can call the 7 people in his old \"speed dial\" list. Going shopping for a new phone. As for Lively - they are not GreatCall. The direct questions I asked where either incorrect or I was sent on a wild goose chase for an answer.I honestly don't mean this to offend anyone but give me the dumb old flip phone back. Anyone interested in the 1/2 ass feature put in this phone would by a simple smart phone.",

                "reviewText": "To start when I googled jitterbug phone I read two different statements saying the cheapest package was $14.99, so i ordered the phone which was $99.99. After receiving it it turns out that offer is no longer available and they wouldn\u2019t honor it and the cheapest package is $19.99. Then they add a $25.00 activation fee, $35.00 if u cant figure it out and they have to do it, and a monthly fee for taxes, fees and surcharges of $8.32 so the bill is actually $28.31. Also Everything is extra, you cant even use the big red emergency button without the upgraded package. I found it very complicated to set up the app, account and lively. The good thing is my dad is hard of hearing and he can hear pretty good on it so for that I\u2019ll give it 3 stars.",
