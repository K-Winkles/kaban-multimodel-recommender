                "reviewText": "While I do plan to go back to Google Pixel in the future, I will say I have mostly very positive things to say about the phone. I will go into detail about the flaws I noticed. I am using the Google Pixel 3 as reference as that was my last phone before I had to rush to buy this one due to having it stolen.First off, let's start with the pros:PROSGreat Battery life - way better than on the Google Pixel (3).Has a solid build and feel to it - Not quite rugged phone level (unless you get the right case for it.) but it has a sleek design that looks simple but very appealing.Able to uninstall pre loaded apps with no issues.Works with the listed carriers, including way more as long as they fit the requirements. (I am on US mobile and it works fine on there.)Options to save the battery - My pixel had battery saving mode but the one on this phone is extreme and if you keep it on there, it's similar to having a rugged phone with a large battery size. It's pretty nice.Transitions are smooth unless a LOT of apps are running - a tiny (And I mean tiny) bit of lag here and there, but it's to be expected.Headphone jacks - you can use an SD card on this phone - the camera is almost as good as the Google Pixel 3 or 4 (HDR mode) - And of course it comes unlocked.Now we will go to the cons. Keep in mind that I have been rocking the google pixel series phone for almost 4 years. I always compare any phone that I need short term or considering for long term before making a choice. As of this time, I will keep this phone long term until I can afford the latest Google Pixel phone.CONSGames (Raid is one example) must either be set to MED. or below settings or (Like Pokemon Go) the game assets (basically EVERYTHING in the game) would need to be pre-downloaded beforehand. I am only pointing this out because there are a number of gamers that due game on the android platform. From what I notice, sometimes the FPS dips a bit when there are too many things on screen. Very noticeable animation lag. On 2D or simple games, this is NOT an issue. But keep this in mind.Slower download/upload speeds - You will notice it when trying to load a page with a lot of content, or say the reddit app. Even on Wifi, while loads faster, still slower.SLOW CHARGING - I am putting this in caps so that way people know. So this does NOT have fast charging. This is something that I actually miss from my pixel. Now, I do not know if I would need to get a different type of charger or cable but from what I read and have seen, it does not fast charge. It charges a bit slowly, it could be due to the larger battery. But just something to be aware of.Speakers are at the bottom of the phone - This is a con for me. But something to be aware of.Only a year of updates.BOTTOM LINE: If you need an new phone, with *almost* the same performance as a google pixel 3 or 4 if it's just to get you by until you buy your main phone, your kid, your parents, etc I highly recommend this phone. With a good hybrid case, you have yourself a rugged phone that is better than 90% of the \"rugged phones\" that are out there. With a normal thin case, it feels light and slim. It's a very solid option. I just hope they can put in a more powerful chip or even throw on more ram so that way it runs games and apps a lot faster.",

                "reviewText": "This phone replaced my older LG phone and I am so glad I bought it. This phone's newer Android version supports all the apps I need unlike my old phone that was running an older version of Android. It has a great battery life and not a lot of bloatware installed (I was able to easily uninstall most preinstalled apps that I didn't want).It has several options available to unlock the screen including pattern, face recognition, and fingerprint (face recognition and fingerprint are optional, they do not have to be enabled to use this phone).I like that many of the standard apps (messaging, contacts, call, etc.) are Google apps. I am not a hardcore gamer, so I basically needed a phone that could make calls, text message, web surfing, and watching YouTube videos, this phone does all this without a problem. This phone is plenty of fast for my needs. I love the amount of emojis and GIFS available on the messaging app, I might be over doing it with the emojis now.Do Not Disturb feature can be found under Settings and then under Sound & Vibration. Do Not Disturb can be customized to not receive calls on a certain days of the week and time. Also allows you to pick who you receive text messaging and calls from during times that you enable the Do Not Disturb feature (you can allow calls and/or messages from: Anyone, From Contacts Only, From Starred Contacts Only, or from None).There are plenty of instructional videos on YouTube which help you customize this phone to your liking (removing or adding any phone feature is very easy).I enabled the Battery percentage display next to the battery icon (my preference). Here are the steps: Go to your Settings, click on Display, scroll down to Status Bar & Notch, click Battery Percentage, and then it gives you three options (Do Not Show, Inside Battery Icon, or Next To Battery Icon).I did have an issue with not receiving notifications from some apps like several News apps. This was easily remedied by going into the Smart Manager app, clicking Auto-Start, and then clicking off Automatically Manage.Overall extremely happy with this phone, I was hesitant of buying a TCL branded phone because I had never had any experience with them but so far I am very satisfied. Thanks TCL, keep up the good work!!!p.s. For just a little more money, I would definitely go with the 128GB version of this phone instead of the 64GB. Much better storage space with the 128GB version.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I set up the phone and immediately I noticed it wasn't working. The keyboard force closes & the apps do, too. It's frustrating when you need to type a quick text and all you keep seeing is the keyboard force closing itself as well as the whole app, without saving texts/comments/messages.Google assistant doesn't work on lock screen or on unlocked screen. Alexa doesn't work on it. Basically, not a single application works properly on this phone.All of the apps load way too slow; try 2+ min for 1 app. It doesn't have NFC & they didn't list that on their description of the phone. What phone doesn't have NFC tags? I use tap to pay everywhere.The WiFi is so slow, that it doesn't work. The network itself has never been worse than with this phone.I used to have service in my home, no problem, until i bought this awful phone. Best part is I Tried to contact seller. They didn't care that they sold me a *very* defective phone. They wanted me to send extra $45 for a \"better\" phone. They said, \"Just pay the difference and we'll send you another phone.I tried to tell them that I have a few apps that are sensitive to being moved from phone to phone. I only have 3 times to switch phones before they close out my account.Camera is great, battery is great. BUT!Customer service doesn't care. Worst phone, ever!",
