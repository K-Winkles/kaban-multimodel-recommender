I was also hung up on after complaining about needing to buy a new one. No one has these SIM cards so I basically just can\u2019t get the phone to work after I already paid for service.

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Samsung A03, lured by its attractive price tag. As they say, \"You get what you pay for,\" and this phone perfectly embodies that sentiment. If you're looking for a budget-friendly device that covers the basics, the A03 might be an option to consider. However, be prepared to deal with its frustratingly sluggish performance.Pros:\u2705 Budget-Friendly: One of the most appealing aspects of the Samsung A03 is undoubtedly its price. It's a wallet-friendly option for those who need a smartphone but don't want to break the bank.\u2705 Decent Display: The display is adequate for everyday tasks such as checking emails, browsing social media, and watching videos. The colors are decent, and the screen size is comfortable.Cons:\u274c Sluggish Performance: The most significant drawback of the A03 is its painfully slow performance. Apps take forever to open, switching between tasks is a test of patience, and even simple actions like typing can lead to frustrating delays. This sluggishness significantly hampers the overall user experience.\u274c Limited Storage: The internal storage on the A03 is quite limited, leaving you with minimal space for apps, photos, and other files. You'll likely find yourself constantly juggling storage to make room for new content.\u274c Mediocre Camera: While I didn't expect flagship-level camera quality from a budget phone, the A03's camera still falls short. Photos lack detail and tend to look washed out, especially in low-light conditions.\u274c Outdated Software: The A03 comes with an older version of Samsung's software, and updates are infrequent. This not only means missing out on the latest features but also leaves you vulnerable to security risks.Overall Impression:The Samsung A03 is a prime example of the trade-off between price and performance. If you're on a tight budget and need a device for the bare minimum tasks like calls, texts, and occasional browsing, the A03 might serve its purpose. However, if you're looking for a smoother experience, even for basic tasks, I'd recommend saving up a bit more for a more capable phone. The sluggishness and limited features of the A03 can quickly become frustrating, overshadowing its affordable price point. Consider your priorities carefully before making a decision.",
