It showed up with heavy scuffs on the back and all four sides. I sent it back the same day it arrived and got a refund but I still needed a phone asap. So I did a little seller feedback research and read a ton a customer comments. I ended up asking the seller GreenTech, a few questions about their phones after they were the quickest to respond and extremely helpful and polite. Felt good about our conversation and ordered a Note 20 from them. Showed up on time and in Like New condition and holds a charge wonderfully. Totally recommend those guys. They may have a little lower rating but clearly they're trying to better their company. Im extremely happy with my \"new\" phone and the seller. Order from these guys and reach out to them if you have concerns. They actually respond and seem to actually care.",

                "reviewText": "This is the FIRST restored/refurbished phone I have ever purchased and owned. I've always been skeptical of the possible quality issues associated with a used device, but I was beyond pleased with the product I received. I ordered the mystic grey. The phone itself came in a standard small cardboard box, obviously not an original box, but despite the generic packaging, the phone inside looked BRAND NEW. There wasn't a single scratch or knick on the device anywhere. It came with the original stylus, and so far has been functioning like a brand new phone. The only complaint I can make, is they sent me a general c-type charger for it, they did not provide a block for it, which is fine considering I have several extras, but the cord itself is in no way any type of fast charger, so it estimated taking 10 hours to charge my phone. So I had to invest in a faster charger, but aside from that, this device came in perfect condition.",

                "reviewText": "Ordered this after I had to return my S21 Ultra due to my phone glitching after I dropped it. I would say it works pretty well. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is it had quite a bit scuffing on the corner and for me to have paid more for the best option in wear it was a bit disappointing.The packaging was great and secure. It also came with a charger. I would still recommend them as I think the phone works as it should and the scuffing was not anywhere I could see once the case was on and the screen was perfect.Battery is okay. Thats my biggest complaint compared to the S21 Ultra. I know I'm probably grading pretty harshly as this is a used phone and battery life isn't going to be like new. You just have to charge every night.Camera is okay. There are better cameras out there, but to take pictures of a night out it or on the go it does the job.Love the pen. I had an S pen before so with the note having it built in is really cool as my last case was super wide/bulky to accommodate storing it. It does pop out when I drop my phone, but seems to work as it should.Basically this phone gets the job done for basic necessities of scrolling socials, making calls, texting, and etc. Works as a phone should.When ordering I didn't realize there were different versions so a little bummed I didn't know there was an Ultra. The back being plastic was a little cringe for me and definitely not what I am used to with Samsung.",
