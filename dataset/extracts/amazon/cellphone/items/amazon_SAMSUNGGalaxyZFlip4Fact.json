It came with no scratches or anything that suggested that it had been used prior to me getting it. The screen is working great (knock on wood).

                "reviewText": "So I ordered another EXCELLENT CONDITION flip4 from Bayshine, the 256GB version this time, hoping it'd be flawless like the 128GB one I got back in December (ended up giving it to my mother) but the one I got today, after a week, was in like \"good enough condition\" HUH? I was really hoping Bayshine would be consistent in it's excellent condition lines but I guess not because this one came with tiny but MANY scratches on the cover screen and VERY noticeable scratch/dent on the hinge and a slight popping/scratchy sound on the right side of the hinge where the sratches are so I will be returning and trying ElGeo fingers crossed-PREVIOUS REVIEW 128GB EXCELLENT CONDITION-(5/5 stars) First of all, shipping was SO QUICK took like 3 days to get to me and I've only had it for 3 days and I really really like it! Works great and came in truly excellent condition, but I'm not sure if it had a screen protector or not, no where in the description did it say it comes with one so I have place one on and was doing a bit of a closing and opening test and it all seems fine, gonna leave it open for a while just incase \ud83d\ude05",
