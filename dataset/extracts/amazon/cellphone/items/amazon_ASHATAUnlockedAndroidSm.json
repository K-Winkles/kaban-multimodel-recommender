This phone has been hollowed out so much that it has none of the apps or programs that you need to do really anything. I can't play games, make calls, send messages or use apps. The phone routinely opens things and then shuts them down within a few seconds and tells you your missing the background programs you need to run. It's completely frustrating. Unless you know how to reprogram a phone it's not worth your time. Which bites since it's really a pretty phone. But that it's only redeeming qualitiy.",
