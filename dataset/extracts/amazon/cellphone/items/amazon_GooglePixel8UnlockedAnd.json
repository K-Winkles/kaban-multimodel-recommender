The only thing i feel like a downgrade in this phone is the under display fingerprint read, it's very slow and sometime it does not even detect my finger. Luckily the face unlock is fast and reliable even under low light situation and can be use on banking app.Overall i am verry satisfied with my Pixel 8",

                "reviewText": "I'm coming from a Pixel 5 which unfortunately got damaged. Over the years I've been hesitant to upgrade because phones are getting bigger/heavier, and the Pixel 5 had the perfect form factor. However, I was in need of a new phone right away and got this through overnight shipping. Here's my experience using the 8 compared to the 5.PROS-The smoothest experience I've ever had transferring data to a new phone; within five minutes my 8 looked identical to my 5, including the home screen, apps, camera photos, etc.-Better speaker quality, making my Pixel 5 speakers sound \"tinny\" by comparison.-It fixed two software bugs that my Pixel 5 had (Always On Display not working, and camera lag when deleting/swiping through photos).-Face unlock is a nice, convenient new feature (for me) and works great.-The display is beautiful as always, and I get decent battery life.CONS-The fingerprint reader is finicky and usually takes 2-3 taps to get in. On the Pixel 5, the sensor is on the back and only needs 1 tap. Much prefer it on the back.Aside from that, I don't have any major complaints. The Pixel 8 feels very much like the Pixel 5 with some minor changes here and there. I only wish it was a smaller phone in weight/size because I can't text one-handed anymore. If Google ever releases another small one, I'd buy it in a heartbeat!",

                "reviewText": "After 2 full months of use and plenty of hours enjoying this phone, I can say it has been one of the best purchases I've made in my life. I spent almost 5 years with a Xiaomi Mi 8 that unfortunately died on my mid-year vacation in 2023, it drowned in a pool, lol, and after that, I was forced to switch to a Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 (the worst cellphone of my life). When I started looking for options I found out the Pixel had almost all the features I was looking for in a replacement for my Mi 8 (fluid system, good camera, compact, elegant, among many others). The only downside I can say about this phone is maybe the battery, even though gets to complete the day, sometimes it can be a bit short, and also the \"quick charge\" is not top-notch for the price we paid, and that is disappointing. After that, I'm super super happy with my Pixel 8!",

                "reviewText": "This smartphone feels amazing in hands and coming from a 6.55\" block, it is like a day and night in weight and size. It fits very well my pockets. The screen is pretty smooth, Pixel UI is very clean and minimalistic, without all the nonsense and infinite options that characterize chinese Ui like Miui or ColorOs. Color otherwise is kind of dull, not vivid and there isn't too much options to change. Camera is Amazing and I see why Pixels compete hand to hand with Iphone; my device basically saved our Christmas diner photo since the Iphone couldn't so much back lighting while the Pixel got an outstanding photo with just one click. Everything feels smooth, especially at 120 Hz but even at 60, it feels greats. Google photo AI editor, magic eraser and noise eraser are amazing tools, I could even use magic editor to erase some numbers from an image for a University project. Now the bad parts about this phone: Chip isn't the most efficient, sometimes it even gets hot easily with minimal tasks, and even worse when using LTE (not 5g since in my country that technology isn't working). I can easily see the difference in battery health when using data instead wifi. without battery saver,this device will lasts like 4 or 5 hours. It is so underwhelming since this is the only way to e joy the 120 Hz refresh rate. With battery saver, things get better and you can accomplish like 6 to 8 hours, but by dimming the phone capabilities.finally the worst part of this phone is the lacking 27w to charge which basically take between 1.5 hours to 2. It is so disappointing that a 2023 Smartphone charges so slowly and with a horrible barrery management your battery depletes like water ins hands. Just to look at the screen You've already lost 1%. So I would recommended this device just to people who prioritizes camera over battery and performance and those who can live with a charger 24/7 (charger not included \ud83e\udd74).",

And it fits in my pocket much easier than the bigger Moto X I came from.The setup blew me away. As soon as I turned on the Pixel 8, and started the set up, my old phone immediately connected to transfer files and apps without my going to some app.The first thing I noticed was how responsive the screen is from my old phone. The fingerprint reader is on the front screen, but that is no issue with me. It seems to work fine.Everything about this phone is great. The camera is top notch. When I clicked the shutter, it takes a picture right now with no delay. The focus, clarity, and resolution, are very good. The 256 GBs of memory is huge too. There is no memory card slot, but you don't need one.I was able to swap my sim card to the new phone, and voila', up and running.Well done Google.",

And although I recognize it is a personal user effect. I have yet to find any adjustment to achieve consumption that allows for all day usage. But still better than my s21+5g.

                "reviewText": "The transfer from my Pixel 3 was a smooth process with the exception of WhatsApp where I lost all my history - because I had no backup? Maybe. Anyway, the phone itself seems fine; fast and smooth and unlike some brands not filled with own-brand alternatives. No hardware problems that I have encountered. The device itself seems slightly taller and maybe just a smidge narrower than the Pixel 3.The camera takes excellent pictures. Detail is great, including in the shadows and highlights.I have decided that I don't like the gesture based interface and have gone back to the three buttons at the bottom of the screen. Other than that, the latest Android seems a logical continuation of the operating system - no big surprises.In sum - it was time to move on from my old P3 and this seems to have been a solid choice. No buyer remorse here, especially given the great Black Friday pricing!",

                "reviewText": "This phone is filled with bugs and seemingly zero support from the manufacturer. Here are some of the reasons why I returned my device.- Bluetooth did not work. This device constantly dropped the Bluetooth connection in my vehicle, this is a common and known issue with Pixel devices and all Bluetooth devices. Google does not have a solution.- Software limitations. Google takes a page from Apple and iOS in limiting the features available to owners for no other reason than trying to shift you to purchase the higher-end model. Why do I not have full camera control on a $1000.00 device? Why can I not customize my home screen and remove any widget that I choose?- Battery life. It's bad.- AI features are buried or not available in my region.",
