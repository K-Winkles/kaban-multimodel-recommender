I only ever upgrade for large technical advantages. Since we hit a standstill in basic cellphone tech capabilities, cellphone companies are forced to play up their differences in between each cell version. They tweak things just a little so it feels different but at the core it is fundamentally the same. If you're looking for a sweet spot between \"enough capablilty to keep up with culture\" and \"but don't want to keep paying more money for the same capabilities each new phone release\" then this is perfect. Has every normal function a better than average smart phone does. Thick in hand, good grip, can take A LOT of damage and still be fine, puddles? You're good. Are you someone who has never grace and constantly fumbles things like me? No worries, your new s8 active has you",

But the screen was in pristine shape as if it was replaced, the battery overall health was estimated at 88% as per accubattery, an app for android to help track battery capacity. All in all it came to me in better shape than Amazon's slcertified renewed guarentee and for 170$ this was a steal. Just wanna thank the seller as I just can't find a new s8 active anywhere anymore so near pristine used was the next best thing. One thing I recommend is to get a high quality charger once the phones gets to you as 3rd party chargers are unpredictable and can kill your battery over time if it's not a reputable company.",
