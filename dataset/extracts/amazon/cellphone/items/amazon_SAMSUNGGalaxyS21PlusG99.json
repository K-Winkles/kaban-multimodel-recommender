                "reviewText": "So i bought the phone cause i have had my note 9+ for years, and it's been through a lot of fights with floors and concrete. Let's just put it that way, so from reading all the reviews i was really really worried and didn't even buy a case yet. Going hey if it doesn't work, i didn't waste money on a good case and i send it back.Nothing was wrong with the case, Though i did realize that the finger scanner was having issues. Why? cause there was a screen protector on it, assumingly to make sure it didn't break on the way here. Then took it off and boom was working fine, i kinda wish i saw a note about that but i didn't, or at least i didn't see it. Getting my phone company to let me use the phone, Quick.Testing all features i knew about, even faster.Smallest thing about the phone: Buttons were a little dinted but not badlyI would suggest getting this phone, 10/10 would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I like the phone and decent price, but the charge cord was weird requiring hard pressure to connect and only certain cords of the same type would work, sometimes it got very hot. I now charge only with wireless.I beleive its a repair phone and in ALL these phones the charge plug is the weak link and fails leaving the phone useless. We need some way to repair/replace this simple hardware and not require new phones when a $2 part fails.",
