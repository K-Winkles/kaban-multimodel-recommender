It doesn't have the best processor or the most memory but it does have an SD card slot which is perfect Since most phones don't have that feature anymore. The screen is amazing the build quality is top notch and I'm thinking about getting one for myself because I got this one for my girlfriend",

Phone feels very premium, and AMOLED screen is great! I worried that the curved edges would make it feel lesss solid in my grip, but its not an issue.FYI: this phone DOES come with a clear TPU case. I was confused about this, and ordered a case that now will cost be half of its price to return... I used to purchase BLU branded phones for their great spec/price ratio but last year Straight Talk switched to VoLTE for its GSM service and did not whitelist BLU. Straight Talk ended up sending my wife and I the LOWEST of low end phones as \" free\" replacements, but these were unusably crappy. TCL to the rescue! Got this model for $119 on sale, but if I had paid the full price of $159, I dont think id have been disappointed. If only the product description more clearly explained the inclusion of a case... :-)",
