It's my third cell phone, and the only one that I may have to return or throw into the trash. First of all, to set it up, you're supposed to call a certain phone number. But when you dial that number, all you get is a recording that says the number is out of service. Then, somewhere in the instruction booklet, I found a second phone number, but that number gave the same result as the first one. So I called their Customer Service. That person managed, after about an hour, and with some difficulty, to connect me to a \"set-up specialist\" with whom I spent two or three hours on the phone. Finally she said my phone was ready to go. But it wasn't. It still won't receive incoming calls. It's advertised as \"simple,\" but it's by far the most ridiculously complicated and impossible to use of any phone I've tried. I will be either returning it or tossing it into the trash.",
