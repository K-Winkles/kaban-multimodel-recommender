I just took pics of the blizzard, Gerri in Michigan and they are really nice! I wanted reliable and a good camera and I got both. I have plenty of storage, fast game play, really cool wallpaper icon, display, font, theme, color personalization. I'm really enjoying this phone. I have had all Iphones, S23 ultra and many androids in my life. This is a good and solid phone. I wanted less of a price tag than the Iphone and highest price flagships, so I chose this one. It updated just fine. I'm at Android 13. If you want a great phone and still want to keep some money... buy this one!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this phone to replace an older 4G phone. It's quite a bit slimmer and lighter. While I wasn't prepared for how much smaller overall the screen is, I am pleased with how nice it is. Video and screen quality is great. Brightness is sufficient, even outdoors. The phone fits a hand or pocket nicely, and the curved edges are just pleasing. It hasn't gotten warm to the touch like my old phone, even when using data and GPS to navigate.The GPS for some reason is SO much more accurate than that on my old phone (which may have to do with Android 13 instead of 9). I love having accurate location information when using the map applications.When resting on its back on a surface like a tabletop, due to the camera lenses on the back it rocks annoyingly when you touch the screen. I used a small rubber foot with Gorilla Glue to even it out on the back. With this mod, the phone is easy to use one-handed on a hard surface but still slips easily into and out of a pocket without snagging.The camera is much better than my old phone's, and the Android 13 and Motorola software makes it easier to take good pictures (I am no great photographer).Sound quality is good from such tiny speakers, and using the phone as ... well ... a phone is just fine. When I listen to music it's with Bluetooth headphones, and they connect easily. Speaking of networking, WiFi just works without histrionics, and the 5G cell data is just fine.I uninstalled quite a few applications after the first setup. I believe this, coupled with using the battery saver feature and restricting apps background data use, helps with battery life. The battery lasts all day; I'm typically at 40-50% by bedtime, but I don't do gaming or movies besides the occasional YouTube clip. You must buy your own charge - the phone does not come with one. Motorola recommends a 68W fast charger, so I bought an Amazon Basics one off this site, which charges it from 80% to 100% in less than 1/2 hour.I haven't dropped it (yet) so I can't tell you about durability ;) .",

                "reviewText": "I'm really loving this phone!Everything works smoother and faster compared to previous Motorola phones that I've had.I'll write more about it after I've used it for a week or 2. Maybe. I already agree with the reviewers that spelled out what they like about this phone.My main purpose of writing this review is to let you know that I found a nice case that fits except for 1 minor adjustment that it needs.The black case I found called 'Aikcks for Motorola Edge 40 5G' (as far as dimensions and snug fit) is a perfect fit and actually quite stylish. It's not just a nice black, it's sweet looking.However, you will need to make a very small opening for the proximity sensor. The new opening will need to be made on the top/left/upper side of the *case*.Note: The case already has an opening on the top/right/upper side. Probably for a slightly different Edge phone... obviously.I used a very small drill bit 1/32\" (I think that was the size) and increased the size of the new opening gradually until I got it approx 1/8\" round. I don't know what material this case is made of, but it's strong, flexible & durable.Just under $7. A great price for sure and if you mess it up by not being careful creating the new opening, you won't mind ordering another. \ud83d\ude0e",

After hours of research, I found that the Motorola Edge 40 is the exact same size as this phone. I purchased 3 different cases that are for the Edge 40 and they fit Motorola Edge 2023 perfectly. The screen protector is also a good fit. Hope this helps others feel less stressed about finding accessories.",
