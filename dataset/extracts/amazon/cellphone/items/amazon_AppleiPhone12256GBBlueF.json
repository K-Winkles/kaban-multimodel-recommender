The battery works great! The screen and back look brand new. All the device functions work as they should. All the buttons, face recognition, sound, and display work as expected. They have no scratches or cracks. I honestly would\u2019ve thought this phone was brand new if it was listed as brand new. I was skeptical at first, but I am so glad I decided to purchase this phone. I saved a lot of money going with this option. I will be recommending this product to any friends who are looking for a new phone.",

                "reviewText": "When buying a second hand device, the ratings: Used Like New, Used Very Good, Used Good and Used Acceptable are important. Your device will look a certain way depending on what you choose. With that said, different suppliers may have a subjective take on what each of these means.Pros: Having never owned an iPhone before, this thing blew me away in spite the slight cosmetic imperfections. Its beautiful and I love it. And it was affordable!-Every thing works well. I got the 128gb version. Great sound, great screen, great experienceCons: The learning curve if this is your first time using iOS. Granted, you will experience this no matter what version iPhone you get. Things work differently here. Not so much that you cant adapt but enough to frustrate.-Battery life was at 86% which though good, was scary. 14% is a lot were I come from.-Those cosmetic scratches took me aback, then I remembered I chose USED: ACCEPTABLE. That humbled me real quick. With that said, still love it, bought a case already.-If you have already experienced a device with 120Hz refresh rate, this will throw you off. You might get disappointed. If you haven't, then great!-Also, if you are stepping down from a more advanced iPhone and short on cash, buying second hand is as you have more choices. But, you will always be reminded someone used it before you so make sure you are already comfortable buying on the second hand market.-Still haven't gotten rid of my android. Was going to but after the learning curve on iPhone, I think having both phones is the better choice. Sorry Tim Cook...",

                "reviewText": "My iPhone SE 2nd gen very suddenly bit the dust after 3 years and I needed a new device FAST! I didn\u2019t want to drop close to $1K on a new phone but still wanted to upgrade from my much older previous phone. My iPhone 12 arrived within a few business days. My only complaints are that the third party charger that was sent along did not work, but thankfully I already had several iPhone compatible chargers in my home. The battery health is at 80% but I expected about that much as it is a used device. So far a full charge with moderate use (listening to music, checking social media and texts) lasts me a whole workday anyways. Besides, even getting a new battery eventually would still be a lot cheaper than buying new from Apple and I felt really confident in Amazon to give me a refund in the event the phone was not in working order. Thankfully, everything functions fantastic! I ordered a T-mobile locked one and then just swapped over my SIM, and it updated on my plan immediately to reflect the new phone. Overall I would absolutely buy from Amazon renewed again!",

It works perfectly fine and it also came with 100 max battery life which is amazing. The speaker for the phone is perfect no static. It does come a little dirty but you can just easily wipe it off. For the price of this phone and the excellent condition which is like brand new is amazing. I would totally recommend purchasing from this seller.",

We got a protector for it to prevent scratches, as well as a phone cover. I consider those standard accessories for any phone.Overall battery life is fair. It is a reconditioned phone, and for a price you can get a new battery installed by someone else, or do it yourself. I've done both. Thankfully Apple has a way for you to tell if the battery is shot. This one was about 20% used, and won't go above that.Easy enough to have an external battery with you.As my friend is new to the iPhone world, he had some questions. Most things he figured out himself, even though he's not technically apt. At all.Facial recognition works really well. I like that it allows you to put in (2) faces. Either one of you without a mask, and one with ... or another person. It doesn't really care.I also like that Apple doesn't send that facial data anywhere. It stays in the phone.",
