                "reviewText": "I have the 8g ram 128g storage. The ram can be expanded from storage +5g. The processor is snappy, and screen is bright. The battery lasts very long and charges ridiculously fast (0-100 in 20min. I literally charge the phone 10 min a day on average). One plus guarantees the battery still have 80% capacity after 1,600 cycles, so battery scenario is arguably best in the business.The cameras are a compromise, passable, but only just. However, to keep the processing and functionality accessable, justifiable.Very well done, Oneplus.",

                "reviewText": "When you first consider the price of the OnePlus10t you might be thinking it is overvalued, but when you unbox it and feel that monster charger and incredibly thick charging cable and remember what \u201cother\u201d companies give you in the box, you begin to see it is a really good deal. The charger and cable are worth $125 alone. Great screen, solid build quality, fastest charger ever and good quality cameras make for a good package. Switching from IPhone is dead simple with the included usb-c to usb-a adapter included in the box. If you have an iPhone, make sure you turn off \u201coptimize photos\u201d a day or two in advance so all your full resolution photos download to the phone. I was able to transfer all my photos and all of my messages from iMessage to the Google messages app. This was important to me because I have a lot of saved conversations I want to keep. All apps from your iPhone will download once Android is booted up. Overall, I really like this phone and the best part: this thing charges faster then any electronic device I\u2019ve ever had, it\u2019s unbelievable. Plus, it charged my sons 4th Gen iPad Air super fast, he thought that was pretty cool. It\u2019s just a matter of time before Apple has to start using RCS in iMessage making for a much better texting experience between iOS and Android and you\u2019ll be ahead of the curve. This is a solid buy, get it.FYI: This phone was activated on Verizon by swapping the SIM card from my iPhone 12 Pro Max and putting it in the OnePlus 10t. I was able to get both 4G LTE and 5G, coverage is improved over the iPhone.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:1) powerful / fast2) a good camera3) the selfie cam is better than the S223) swipe music controls for any music app4) customizable swipe controls to open your favorite apps when the screen is off5) ability to sign into WiFi from the tray instead of going to settings every time6) ability to connect to Bluetooth from the tray7) Zen modeCons:1) the camera is lacking for a flagship. The macro lense never takes quite crisp enough pictures. The main cameras zoom is grainy and pixelated. The main cameras video doesn't have good stabilization software2) trying to change media output is a pain compared to other phones, leaving you swiping the tray down twice, clicking a menu, clicking media output, and finally able to change it3) you can't change the shortcuts on the lock screen for some reason4) it is hard to disable the Google feed screen which I personally find useless. You have to disable the entire Google app. This was an issue on the N100 as well.5) after the last system update their \"red cable club\" app, is no longer in the app menu and cannot be uninstalled or disabled, and thus it is requesting updates when I will NEVER use it.6) after the same update, the Shelf (a secondary tray essentially) which was useful at first due to the pedometer and ability to add extra widgets like Wundergrounds weather, suddenly you can't use any custom widgets and the remaining options all suck, so it's an entire tray with one useful app... Aka, as good as useless.7) No MicroSD slot for the sole purpose of trying to force you to pay more for the next level sub-model. This is becoming a common practice, but it remains a BS one. It would be like a new TV not coming with any inputs, to try and force you to buy the higher model that has a built in Xbox console. You upgrade and get the Xbox and streaming apps, but you better hope you never want a blu-ray player or PS2. In this case it makes it a complete pain in the ass to transfer videos and photos or to clean them up on a larger screen, as the cable connection on phones has always been clunky compared to swapping a MicroSD.1+ OxygenOS is a love hate thing. There are features other phones lack like customizable and music swipe commands, and then there are usually features that work on other phones but for no reason seem to be missing or inaccessible on a 1+.2020 vs 2022:I wasn't overly impressed with my last 1+. It was somewhat glitchy. I've had this phone for about a month so far and it seems to be working great. No major issues or glitchiness happening so far.What I will say is this is a big step up from the N100 I had previously, which seemed quite glitchy.",
