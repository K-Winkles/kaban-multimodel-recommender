My husband's been using this Nord phone for a year now and really likes it. He assured me it's easy to use and has a long battery life. His prior phone was a Samsung too.I like this Nord phone as much as my old Samsung, but the Nord is a lot cheaper. The screen is a good size but not too large. It does everything I want it to do, takes good pics, and there was very little down time learning to use it because it's intuitive. It's got a lot of memory for the price, twice what my Motorola had.I've used Apple for work, and I much prefer Android. This Nord fills the bill nicely. If you like Android and don't want to pay a ton of money to finance a cell phone purchase, this might be the phone for you.Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased these in \"used like new\" condition at a very good price and after receiving phone, description was spot on.I have found the camera to be ok to good and certainly not terrible. You simply need to know what kind of lighting works in your photo. You can't really expect this phone at this price to deliver good photos in poor lighting. Yes, I did try other camera software but eventually went back to the OEM camera software. If you know how to take a good photo, you shouldn't have any problems with the camera delivering more than acceptable results.As per complaints regarding \"finger print reader\", I hear you. I have gotten it to work much better by tweaking a couple of settings. In settings option, I turned off \"auto-rotate\", this seemed to improve reader greatly. Still, you need to take your time and have a clean finger and clean reader. It still doesn't work 100% of the time. Sometimes it works seamlessly and other times just stubborn :-(It updated OS to Android 11 along with a couple of security updates with the last coming on 12/01/21. Additionally, I do not use the stock launcher. Phone, WIFI and DATA connection are great and has not disappointed. Using Mint Mobile which uses T-Mobile.All in all, at this price, the Nord N100 is a decent phone. I would say it delivers as expected 90% of the time. My biggest complaint is still the finger-print reader, other than that, I'm actually pleased with the phone.",

                "reviewText": "1. FIRST PROBLEM: One of the updates duplicated all my apps which ultimately resulted in me losing my contacts, call history, messages, pictures and videos.Final response from the OnePlus tech regarding the loss was: \"That is unfortunate. Is there anything else I can help you with?\" The supervisor advised me to \u201cSeek help somewhere else.\u201d2. MOST RECENT PROBLEM: I\u2019ve just discovered that this is a \"DEMO PHONE\" which means it was made with LIMITED FEATURES and supposed to be displayed in a store, not sold to a customer.*The LIMITED FEATURES APPEAR TO BE PRESENT BUT THEY DON'T WORK*OnePlus did not divulge on their product page nor did they divulge during our MANY early conversations that this was a DEMO PHONE.DEMO PHONES are manufactured with limited functionality but this OnePlus Nord was advertised as, and sold as, a fully functioning phone intended for customers.I suspect that the DEMO issue is what kept it from properly backing up, which caused me to lose everything. I can\u2019t be sure that it\u2019s properly backing up now.*ONEPLUS LET ME BELIEVE THE ISSUES COULD BE RESOLVED*All along, I assumed that I was the problem and that I just needed to figure out how to use the features. I did not know the features were not designed to function on this phone nor did I know that my time trying to resolve issues was a waste of time.Some of the features I learned to live without but not being able to change the notification sound has become quite problematic as I have one app that sounds several times per hour. I have to check my phone every time the phone sounds to see if it's an actual message or that other app.Imagine having to check your phone several times per minute.BOTTOM LINE: Don't buy this phone.",

                "reviewText": "I've used just about every low end smart phone sold in the US over the years. I finally got smart and bought a Nord N100. I absolutely LOVE this phone.The battery life is one of the longest lasting batteries I've seen. I usually have Lubetube music playing 4-8 hours a day at work or some other form of streaming program. End of the day, phone is at ~65%. So two full days of non stop use 8 hours a day and still have battery left, cant beat itWhile it does have google programs on it, its not filled with crap like a lot of the other cheap phones out there. I have not rooted this phone, dont know if I will even look into rooting it as the phone does everything I want it to. Even has a sensor kill button that shuts off every sensor on the phone (which is nice for the times I need to wear my tinfoil hat)Hoping they make a 2022 variant of the N100 otherwise I'll be buying another one of these if/when it dies",

The camera is ok in good light but is poor in low light situations. Phone isn't fast for intensive games but its plenty fast enough for using chrome, gmail, and netflix.I'd give it 4 stars if not for fact that you can't disable notifications for the OnePlus Store. You can't delete it which would be fine if you could hide it. You can put the notifications in silent mode so they won't make noise but they still show in the notification banner. The OnePlus Store notifications happen about once a week or so and they're to advertise that things are on sale. I did not know I would be getting ads when I bought the phone.",
