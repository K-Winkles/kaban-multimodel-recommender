Other basic phones often also come preloaded with its YouTube or Facebook apps that cannot be removed. Tricky!I added a line to my phone plan, and my local AT&T store installed a SIM card for me, free of charge, and it connects to 4G. It\u2019s like a candy bar phone from 1997. Feels like a toy in your hand, but the battery lasts a long time, and NO internet access of any kind. It\u2019s not even capable of running apps.",

                "reviewText": "At first it seemed like a decent, easy to use phone, but it didn't take look for it to show full bars but 'Emergency calls only'. The provider can see and ping the phone, but the phone can't be used. Tested with different SIM cards but with the same result. Also, there are several spelling mistakes in the OS. When it does work, the call quality was awful.It's a shame, because the phone is very easy to use for elderly people, such as my mother in law and the charging cradle is handy because you don't have to fiddle with plugging in a cord. For such a simple phone, the battery life is also relatively short (less than two days with no usage). There was a second battery in the box, but as hard as it is to open the back cover, I can't see my mother in law figuring that out. The bad part of that is also that when you remove the battery (or it dies), the phone loses settings like time and date, which it should get from the network anyway!Needless to say, i'm sending it back and I would NOT recommend this phone.",

Of course, I dispute this broad brush generalization. With that I will say that the phone is easy to use and easy to read for anyone. It has a strong signal and very good reception of weak incoming signals. Fact is that I hate carrying a heavy, oversized so-called \"smart phone around all day. The EasyPhone is light weight, attractive and compact, all of which are the reasons I like it. It's one significant drawback is that it does not have a camera. But then I'm not Ansel Adams or Steven Spielberg, so I don't make my livelihood shooting pictures. All in all, I like the phone and recommend it.",

The charge cradle is good and charges up the phone well, but the cradle is light and the cord could have been somewhat longer. I like how perfectly it fits in the palm of my hand. It came with slots where you could put it on a lanyard. It does come with one but I have a feeling it won't be long enough. Whenever I buy something, I try to find the PDF manual for it. It's quite hard unless you pay for it online OR find it where it's greatly stretched out. It's quite hard to figure out how to do certain parts I caps. The EASIEST is to put your contacts in ALL caps or have one cap only with small letters forthcoming. Yes, it does have a hard copy of the manual but even that can't help you figure it out. You can email them in INDIA. Oh yes, India. I myself will use it with a carrier I want as it's unlocked. The infinitesimal wallpapers and choice of ringtones are limited. Lastly, you may be able to get online with it but I wouldn't get it for that in case it doesn't work. I kept trying to figure out how to use the phone, and I ran into problems trying to install the SIM card. The chosen carrier I chose sent me SIM cards, but based on the pictures in the manual weren\u2019t true to how the compartment opened up for it to be loaded. I am sending it back. I had two types of SIM cards and neither seemingly worked.",

                "reviewText": "This phone is built of flimsy material and the battery compartment lid actually bends as you push to slide it out. I got the red version and discovered that red is not the colour of the plastic, but instead, was sprayed on top of the black colour and the imperfect overspray is visible on the inside of the lid cover (but not the outside where it looks perfect|).Having said this, the features and ease of use of this phone is exactly what my elderly mother needed. The screen display could be magnified for easy viewing with the huge numbers, and when combined with the audio reading of each number pressed (if set for this), makes if it impossible for seniors to make a mistake when dialing numbers. The phone is also light and comes with a neckstap so that you can wear the phone like a necklace which prevents seniors from dropping the phone or misplacing it. Overall, extremely easy for senors to use, and very easy to set using the simple menu list.However, there are two horrible features, both of which can be deactivated from the phone's menau. First, the phone comes with a flashlight feature which is switched on (and drains the battery) far too easily by inadvertently touching the on/off button located on the side of the phone. Second, there is an FM radio feature which you need to switch off in the menu otherwise it'll cause you massive grief. Not sure why such a retarded feature which nobody on earth will ever use was added to the phone,Apart from these two features, the phone is absolutely phenominal, my mother loves it, and I would highly recommend it",

                "reviewText": "--and contemplate the probability of three defective Easy phones in quick succession, in light of dozens of positive reviews: \" ... super easy ...happy with ... real bargain ... perfect phone ... best money that I have ever spent\". Jeez! Not having purchased, or even used, any cell phone before venturing on this one, our approach was both punctilious and, in retrospect, lamentably authoritarian. The first one could not be programmed; we struggled with it ...\"must be our fault ... actually, not ...\" before sending it back, happily within the return time. The second one (I did say authoritarian) continually would not switch on; for a while we thought that having to push buttons all over the place to activate the damn thing was normal operation -- but finally both we, and it, quit altogether. Having returned this one, we ordered a third (yes...), which lasted longer than the second, and then conveniently died in the same way, just outside the return window.During this finally expensive, admittedly educational saga, this deceptively fine-looking phone -- always a sucker for red -- let us down, crucially, on two emergency calls, and one other important enough to be a significant inconvenience. We make no claim to being techies, in the contemporary sense, but do expect that putting a fair amount of time and effort into learning how to use an unfamiliar unit will yield something reliable in operation. This parade of shoddy phones was an unsettling let-down.Having contemplated whether it was actually worth it to us to try again (...\"couldn't we figure out something with the laptop, dear?\"), we have -- with a Ushining cell phone, also from Amazon. Appearances can always be deceptive, it appears -- this model looks very much like the uneasy phone (red!), but is conveniently a tad bigger, works in the same putative way, is less expensive and, most salient, has been one hundred percent reliable in operation for over two months now.I rarely give only one star in a review, but this one for the uneasy phone should be halved. At the same time, I salute the many who seem to have had success with it; I just hope this continues for them. Marcus W.",

Great for anyone who does not want hi-tech, who wants that simple convenience , and what's better than a flip-phone to carry around ???? Reduced stars for battery life because not yet fully tested - BUT NOTE Easyphone came with extra battery; and it does not have a touch screen, and this might be the greatest downside as reaching some of the phones extras requires using buttons and arrows and might be detrimental for the seniors the phone is aimed at.
