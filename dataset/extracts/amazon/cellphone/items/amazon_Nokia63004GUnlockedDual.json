How can I ensure other people hear me on my microphone? If you are experiencing microphone issues with your device and your product has a Google Assistant button, please ensure that the Google Assistant button is not stuck or dirty as this will cause the microphone to not function as intended. If the Google Assistant button is not obstructed, please ensure that there is no dirt or debris in the headphone port of your product. How can I turn up the volume to my speaker? Please ensure that there is no dirt or debris in the headphone port of your product. Why is my phone feeling warm, closing apps or occasionally slowing down? During extended operation, the device may feel warm. In most cases, this is normal. To avoid getting too warm, the device may automatically slow down, close apps, switch off charging, and if necessary, switch itself off. If the device is not working properly, please visit Nokia\u2019s customer support website. They may recommend that you take your device to the nearest authorized service facility. My phone won\u2019t charge. What should I do? First ensure the issue isn't with the power source or socket you're using - you can quickly check this by plugging your phone into a different outlet, then checking if it charges. If the socket is not the issue, try taking a closer look at the power cable or charging port on your phone, ensuring everything appears as it should. Then, try turning your phone off completely and plugging it into the socket - bear in mind if the battery is completely drained, it might take up to 2 or 3 minutes to start charging. How can I contact support? Our customer support page offers a number of ways that you can contact support. Please visit the Nokia website for further assistance. How do I fix button issues on my phone?

It mailed fine when I transferred it to my computer.Surprising that a phone with a 4 GB internal memory can not email a 6.4 MB attachmentBuild a leather case with a magnetic catch for my new Nokia :-)* Very good voice quality* Very good battery live for what it offers* Very easy to set up email with your email provider* Confusing instructions \"Avoid touching the antenna area while the antenna is in use. Contact with antennas affects the communication quality and may reduce battery life due to higher power level during operation.\" ..but the Instruction manual has not indication WHERE the antenna is. The OS , too, is not intuitive* Annoying for texting, if you like to use predictive mode. Every time you have to use the # key to insert, e.g. @, it falls out of it.* Can NOT handle message from my daughter that includes pictures of my grandchildren taken with her smart phone. Too high resolution for the phone to handle it. Will tell you to \"download\" than sends error message* Google Maps includes \"your location\" but this a) takes around 3+ minutes, and b) then shows me seven miles off from where I am* Camera is 0.3 MP , that's ok for me, but white balance is good only for outdoor shots* Games can NOT be removed. Have zero interest in playing those, but they can not be unloaded* Nowhere CLOSE to the build quality of my previous Nokia..Overall, more than needed for people who only want to talk, text, and read email but not enough for people wishing to use Google Maps and Directions.",

                "reviewText": "Nokia missed the ability to hit a home-run with this phone. The 4G support on multiple bands, available memory and reasonable processor means that this phone has the ability to support a lot of features. However, the KaiOS operating system is buggy, poorly supported, and clumsy. I've tried contacting Nokia and Kaitech directly about issues that I've had and the customer support is almost non-existent.The phone features the ability to sync calendars and e-mail with built in google support. ActiveSync is also a featured protocol but doesn't appear to be supported. According to Nokia KaiOS doesn't support it at all, but the option is available in the phone, so that's confusing. Trying to sync with my Office365 account, with the correct settings and credentials, the phone returns an \"incorrect username or password\" error. I have confirmed with my company's IT department that the settings are correct and features enabled-it's an OS issue. Google sync with Gmail seems flawless and reasonable quick. Syncing with Google Calendar is a miserable fail. After multiple attempts to sync my calendar with the status bar showing that a sync was occurring, but nothing ever happened, I finally resorted to deleting my calendar and manually entering events one-by-one. This seemed to correct the problem, but I have to wonder at what point will the sync decide to stop working again.Alarms do not activate on time. They are consistently 6 hours off from the set time. Nokia's response was that I was either setting them up wrong, or I needed to reset the phone to factory settings and try again. A solution that works most of the time is to set the phone to not automatically sync the date and time. Setting the time zone manually fixes the problem. Usually. If an alarm goes off at the wrong time I can delete it and re-add it and it will usually work correctly. Not knowing if an alarm is going to go off at the correct time is a big issue for anyone who relies on the alarms.The screen is difficult to view in direct sunlight unless the brightness is turned all the way up. Which you then need to reduce when you're indoors unless you want to go blind. Having a TFT display would improve that, and improve battery life. Speaking of which, battery life really isn't that great. If you want a phone that will last a week or so without charging, look somewhere else. I find myself charging this phone every night with very little usage.Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi calling are great. The hand-off from Wi-Fi calling to cellular can be a bit rough at time and has resulted in a few dropped calls, but I've found that as long as I have good LTE service there isn't a problem.You can only reassign one button. The left button will always be for notices and the right one will always be for camera, unless I've been unable to find a setting to change that anyway.The KaiOs store is a joke. There are a few useful apps, but far and away the majority of them are ad-filled games that are just reskins of other games in the marketplace.The phone is larger than you would think a feature phone would be. If you're looking for a small pocket phone you might want to look elsewhere. It's not nearly as large as a smartphone, but it's still tall.Google Assistant works well, which is good since it's about the only efficient want to use texting or email. Predictive text works better than some other feature phones, but it's really nothing to brag about. You can quickly type out messages if you're aware of the quirks, but the biggest complaint I have is that you cannot set it as the default input method. Even though you have it turned on in the settings, you still need to press the # key four times in order to switch to predictive input. It's more annoying than you'd think something like that should be.If Nokia would ditch KaiOs, revamp their Series30 or Series40 operating systems and go back to their roots, they would be a lot more competitive in the feature phone market. Instead of trying to rebrand nostalgic devices, either re-issue the legacy device with 4G and WiFi support, or build something better from the ground up. There are plenty of \"dumb phones\" on the market, but to have a candybar style phone that supports wifi calling, Office integration, a useable app store, and still be a reasonable size seems a bit of a unicorn. If there's anyone familiar with a Nokia 301, that would be just about the perfect phone to add newer features to and re-release.",

It has WiFi Calling and voLTE which is nice, but because the operating system for this phone is rather obsolete (KaiOS 2.5 which is based on an older version of Mozilla Firefox), it is pretty slow and the web browser and other apps don't work too well. The performance is okay-ish. Lately I've noticed that it hangs around for about 5 seconds before loading the apps or my text messages. Also, I've noticed that if you want to switch between speaker and ear during a call, the option will disappear if you don't turn the screen back on, and then you won't be able to switch again until you hang up. Also, although you can open texts during a call, you can't click on any links. If you want a dumbphone without any bells and whistles, this phone is okay for that, but there's better ones out there.",

Was not fit for purpose- so Im returning it for refund.Furthermore after my previous 3G Nokia which used Symbian OS- I found the 6300 4G KaiOS operating system very user unfriendly. Bundled games & other bloatware could not be uninstalled, Hot keys could not be assigned, Couldn't work out how to put calls on speaker- just a pain in the ass.
