                "reviewText": "I needed an unlocked phone to use in Italy and Austria. I bought this S21+ along with an \"Orange Holiday Europe\" SIM card.The phone arrived in excellent condition, with no scratches or dents. The screen appeared to have been replaced. After setting it up, I tested it by installing SIM cards from AT&T and TELLO, both worked perfectly - it's definitely unlocked.Right before the trip, I installed the \"Orange\" SIM card with the phone powered down. Upon arrival in Italy I powered it up, and it immediately connected to the local service. We used Google Maps to get from the airport to our hotel some 50km's away, no problems at all.Photos taken on the trip were excellent. We installed Google Translate and Microsoft Translator which worked perfectly and were a real asset in helping us navigate the foreign signs, menus, etc. We also set up Hot Spot and Tethering, and used that along with wireless calling on our US SIM based phones to make and receive free calls and texts to/from US numbers. It all worked as expected with no issues.There are two minor issues to report.The battery life was OK, I would start each day at 100% but by end of day it typically had around 30% remaining. My new (locked) S23+ easily gets two days on a single charge.I did notice a minor blemish on the screen after a week of using it. At first I thought it was just a greasy smear, but no amount of cleaning has managed to remove it. I didn't notice this when I first received the phone so it most likely manifested after use. It would seem to be a flaw with the screen itself. I did not use a screen protector, which may or may not have helped to prevent it from occurring. Fortunately it's close to the bottom of the screen and has not really affected the viewing area, nor has it affected the touch screen in the area of the blemish.All-in-all I am happy with this phone. I plan to use it for future international trips as it can do what I need without having to pay the $10-a-day AT&T International Roaming plan - that soon gets very expensive with 2 or more phones.",

So far so good... phone is in great condition, with minimal sign of use. It activated on Verizon on first try with no store visit or phone calls to CS.

                "reviewText": "Just be aware that when setting up the phone the Software is likely extremely outdated so expect an hour to set it up after downloading 2 years of updates which will eat up around another 20-30GB of the 128GB you get,aside from transferring your own data to the device.Other than that the phone itself is good. Few minor scrapes and scratches around the camera,not original box,bare bones packaging,no interior padding or light bubble wrap.Came with pre-installed screen protector (which I changed anyway),can confirm it came with a generic charger that I didn't even bother to open,would not recommend you risk damaging the phone plugging it up with it,buy a higher quality one for a few extra bucks.receipt and return slip in the box. No headphones.Battery life shoots down by 10-15%fast but may just be an analysis flaw based on aging, it still lasts plenty long about 5 or 6 hours with heavy use. Fingerprint,screen,everything is fine no issues with the phone itself. Wireless charging is a bit slow for me, super fast charging works.Cameras functional.That's about it.",

                "reviewText": "I'll start saying my phone disappeared after delivery for almost 2 days.. I know this is not on seller but UPS didn't have me sign and after shooting the picture probably moved the package cause I found it in a totally different location. Luckily I found it because seller told me I had to wait 10 days before taking action on the phone and I bought this one cause my older phone is dead. I believe when you pick up a delivery service you should be responsible for it and I don't want to spend twice the money to get a product.Phone looks great, from 12 inches you can see some minor scratches here and there but I don't mind and those are very very minimal. However, BATTERY LIFE is trash. Charged to 100% in the morning the phone cannot reach the end of the day, usually by 3pm it is under 20% and I have not even installed half of the app I usually use.Microphone is broken, I tried all the software solution recommended from samsung, soft reset, factory reset, permissions, cache wiping etc...During phone calls or recording volume and quality goes up and down so much that people cannot understand what I am saying.Screen, Camera, overall look and sound are pretty good. I would def recommend the model but experience with this seller so far is very low.",
