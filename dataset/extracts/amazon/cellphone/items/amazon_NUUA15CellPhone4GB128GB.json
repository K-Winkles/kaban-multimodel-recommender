I like everything about it with the possible exception of how hard it was for me to figure out how to turn it off. You have to use the pull down quick menu, and then it's in the lower right hand corner. The battery life is long, the charge time is pretty fast, the sound is decent, as is the call quality. It was very easy to set up, too. I don't think you can go wrong with this one.",
