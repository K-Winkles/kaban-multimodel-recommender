Actually lighter than my previous Galaxy Nexus i9250 which was smaller than it. Talking alarm clock, bigger screen, clean pictures at high focus all big pluses. Pedometer helping me to keep focused on burning the calories. Wasn\u2019t able to install Samsung Switch on my previous device but all my apps were installed automatically. Another big plus\u2026the battery life. Currently running the device on power saving mode and I do not have to walk to work with my charger again, even on busy days, meaning lots of calls, short videos and using apps that rely on either WiFi or data services. My one negative so far is that on trying to unlock my screen with password it almost always locks back after entering the first letter. Also cannot find where to adjust settings so that phone can say name of person calling. Found it at first and now for some reason cannot find it back again. Great phone overall. I look forward to learning more and using it more to manage my life. Also hoping to see Lollipop on it soon.",

I'm not a technologically inclined person, but its easy to use. I'll be going to get it added to the Tmobile plan later this week, but without the SIMs card so far its picking up full bars where I live. Waiting on the SIMs and I'll update on the 4GLTE. The charger is a bit different than what I'm use to, but probably cause its a international version. It has three pieces. One is the normal US plug in, one is the usb, and the other is this prong thing I've not seen before. But again could be cause its an international. Either way its charging really well. Straight from the box, the battery had 50% power. I played with it for several hours last night and several hours today before could get the battery down enough to charge for first time. So I'm expecting great battery life.",

                "reviewText": "Instead of offered international model SM-G900F, I have received a chinese SM-G9006V re-flashed with G900F firmware. All labels on the phone and on the box say it is G900F (fake labels I guess), but when you boot it into the download mode it shows that it is actually SM-G9006V with Knox counter ticked (which means it was re-flashed).There are a lot of fake Galaxy S5 phones on the grey market and one of the only few good ways to check if the phone is genuine is to boot it into the download mode and see the real model number.And the charger that is included with the phone is not powerful enough to charge it. The phone see the charger connected, but it doesn't charge at all.Seller: BlutekUSA.Update:More problems discovered:1. This phone can't connect to the secured wireless network when MAC Address Filtering is turned on (phone's MAC is registered in the list of allowed devices). At the same time Galaxy 4 mini, Galaxy Ace, iPad-2 Mini and HP Touchpad connect with no problems.2. The first screen of download mode is all in Chinese symbols. When you get past that it shows the model number SM-G9006V. It also shows that Knox Counter was tripped (0x1 (4)), and that the system installed is a custom system, not official. At the same time it shows official G900FXXU1POEC system in the \"about the device\" tab in \"Settings\".3. The recovery mode is not accessible, so there is no way to restore this device to the factory settings. When booting into the recovery mode, it shows the following message: \"Recovery Booting.... Set Warranty Bit: recovery\" and after a little bit reboots into the normal user mode.My guess is that in attempt to sell cheap SM-G9006V as a G900F, the phone was flashed with partially modified G900FXXU1POEC firmware, as there is no way genuine G900F firmware can be flashed into the wrong device).4. There is a half millimeter gap between the bezel and the glass on the left side of the phone.I'm looking into returning this item before it is too late.",

                "reviewText": "I love this phone and this is the second time I purchase it; this time as a gift to my father who also loved it and could feel a big difference with the S3 that he was using before.Even though Samsung released the S6, I will stick to my S5 as it still has support for MicroSD (which is a big deal for me) and the fact that I can change the battery with higher capacity whenever I want to. I purchased a 7200 mAh battery that I sometimes use when I know I am going to be hammering the phone for a couple of days without a change to charge it.But going back to what's on the box on the purchase, it has everything I want, the differences with capacity in camera, screen, processor in comparison with S6 are not that great, so I would stick to this cheaper model. It it light, comfortable, screen size is great.This particular model (SM-G900F) does support 4G (not all S5 do support it, but I think it is important for you to know in case you need it). Yes, I do my homework before investing in a phone.Hope this review helps someone make a decision.",
