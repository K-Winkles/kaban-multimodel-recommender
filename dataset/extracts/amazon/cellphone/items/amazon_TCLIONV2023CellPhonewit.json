                "reviewText": "I purchased the TCL 20 Pro in Moondust Gray to replace my TCL 10 Pro. Although specs alone won't suggest a major leap forward, I can attest this generation is truly an upgrade.First thing to note is the screen. It's a little taller than the TCL 10 Pro and I really like the extra real estate. TCL's known for making excellent TVs and that display expertise is evident in the 20 Pro. The display is bright, colorful, and is easy on the eyes, no matter what I'm watching or reading. Improved processing also makes it smoother while jumping between apps or scrolling through long pages.The camera is much improved over the 10 Pro. Again, on paper it doesn't seem like much. However, clearly TCL made key improvements in all the right places, most notably with the Sony-sourced lenses and updated camera software. Not sure what else they tweaked, but it's a big improvement over the 10 Pro and it takes pics that are vibrant and clear, regardless of lighting conditions.One of my favorite features is carried over from the 10 Series and that's the SmartKey. It's an extra button on the side that can be programmed to do quick tasks. Unlike other manufacturers, TCL makes it so easy to quick launch just about anything with SmartKey. It's a little higher up on the body than on the 10 Pro so it's placement doesn't feel quite right yet, but I'm sure I'll get used to it.Processing is greatly improved. So far the phone is fast, smooth, and shows no signs of sluggishness moving between apps or while browsing the web. Even the camera processing for Portrait and Super Night photos seems quicker than in the 10 Series.Something that might get lost in other reviews, but that I really appreciate as a former Pixel user, is the lack of bloatware. Beyond some basic software like TCL's excellent NXTVISION, or theme improvements, the phone isn't too far off from stock Android. VERY big plus.TCL is known for creating products that punch above their respective weight classes, with performance that belies their price tags. I can attest that the phone's performance (not to mention the incredible build quality) stays true to that reputation. In some ways it naturally isn't going to rival flagship phones from other brands that cost twice as much, but trust me it punches far above its weight class.",

                "reviewText": "I was concerned getting this phone since I had Straight Talk that ran off Verizon towers, and everything I've read about this phone said it's iffy with Verizon. But I bought it.It arrived, I plugged it in, turned it on and it said to insert SIM card. I took the one from my old phone and put it in. (One thing though, the SIM card tray wouldn't open with a push pin, a paperclip, or a sewing needle. After rummaging through the box it came in I found the tiny pin that came with phone. It was the only thing that opened the tray. So don't lose this 1/2 in pin or you'll never get tray open again!) After too long, I figured out how to put my micro SD card in. You have have to put it in upside down with the metal facing up.Everything worked fine, I was able to download Straight Talk app. Then phone said it had to restart to install updates. So I restarted the phone. Then the trouble began. My phone had no bars. No internet. Straight Talk app wouldn't open. It was basically like my phone data plan wasn't working. My email still strangely worked, though texts and calls didn't. Then I had to go to work.After work, I sat in the parking lot for 25 min connected to Starbucks wifi trying to get my $45 data plan I had to connect. After much despair, thinking this phone wouldn't work with Verizon towers or straight Talk after all, I happened on the solution by pure luck. I was in settings > SIM card & cellular network > Cellular Network > Access Point Names, and I clicked on the 3 dots in top right corner. It said \"Restore to Default\". So I clicked it. The Access Point name changed from VZWINTERNET to WENTP. Internet still didn't work. So I restarted phone. VOILA! I had bars! I could make calls! Internet!!! I don't know why they had to make it so condiluted and hard to figure out what to do, just to connect.I was so happy. Everything ran smooth. My games were smooth, hardly a lost frame the whole time I played Ulala Idle Adventure. YouTube ran without buffering.This phone has 256 GB of storage! The most I've ever had and I LOVE it! Perfect for gaming, storing videos and photos. I haven't had much chance to use camera yet.The one thing I think is garbage so far is the speaker. It's on the bottom of the phone and makes calls sound muffled. Lying in bed with it sitting on chest watching videos, leaves something to be desired. I have to hold phone with a finger wedged under it so speaker isn't smothered in blanket.That, and the difficulty of getting my plan to connect are the only 2 gripes with this TCL 20 Pro 5g as of now.Update: I had a chance to use cameras, and they are the best! I recorded some chickadees at my feeder in slow mo, and \ud83e\udd2f. Well worth it. I've noticed sometimes when I take macro photos, it's blurry around the edges, but otherwise great. The phones flashlight is pretty good; better than any other phones I've had. On the left side of phone, there is one button. You can disable it, or program it. I have mine set up 1 press for camera, 2 presses for flashlight, and you can also set it up for a 3rd long press. Headphone jack is on top of phone, which is wonderful for putting phone in pocket and going on a walk while wearing wired headphones. One last tiny gripe I've found is the charging cord that came with it is kinda hard to push into phone. I have to use a tiny bit of actual muscle strength. I tried with my old phones cord and it went in easy. Both charge it the same speed, so it works out.",

                "reviewText": "Is it a premium flagship phone, no. But who cares. The TCL Pro 5g delivers solid performance and value. I have had mine for about 2 weeks and am very pleased. Battery life is great, just remember to allow for a couple of discharges. After that you will begin to see battery perform very well. After all day normal use I still have 50% battery left. That's with listening to some music, podcasts, texts, online shopping, etc. For those of you that live on your phone, there will never be a battery big enough for you. It feels good in the hand, smooth UI, speaker is loud enough, 5G does not drain battery down that much as I've read others say. Screen is clear and bright. In screen finger print reader works, just not the fastest response time. It also has a headphone jack and capable of 24 bit audio playback, which if your into higher audio quality will be a great . Has an IR remote built in for TV's, soundbars etc. It has NFC, wireless charging, FM Radio, Multi Lens camera, and you can make a phone call should you choose to do so. It works and that matters. So if you want a phone that looks good and actually does everything it should and more. Forget about what someone else has, TCL has hit the ground running with affordable high quality devices. and I bet they will be giving the big guys a run for their money in the future as they did with their TV's.",
