                "reviewText": "I purchased the Ulefone Note 16 Pro, lured by its affordable price point and the promise of solid performance for an entry-level smartphone. However, my experience with this device has been incredibly negative even for someone used to buying inexpensive devices.The most glaring issue is the battery's inability to charge beyond 30%. Despite my best troubleshooting efforts, including restarting the phone, experimenting with different chargers and cables, and even performing a factory reset, the problem persists.It's troubling that a device, barely two months old, exhibits such a fundamental flaw. This experience has shattered my confidence in the Ulefone brand and highlights a broader issue within the smartphone market, where consumers seeking affordable options are often left with substandard products. The fact that this device without suffering exposure to water or being dropped or any other external factor can fail so quickly is not just unacceptable; it feels like an offense and a betrayal.Even for entry level devices this is unacceptable. Since we are all directly or indirectly forced to rely on these devices there should be regulations in place to ensure that all products, regardless of price, meet a minimum standard of quality and reliability. Consumers who dont care about fancy features deserve better than to gamble on the core basic functionality of what has become essential technology.I understand that i might have lost my money and most importantly my time. However, i can still help you save yours. If you need a basic phone for texting, calling, or checking your email look elsewhere",

                "reviewText": "The phone itself is good. I cannot get my data to work even though I have 15GB. I live on a border city and noticed it worked when I got close to the USA. Has anyone else had this problem? I though these were supposed to be Canadian phone's that worked with Canadian towers. I have already put in a ACN for Koodo, it says it is connected but will not pull up any webpage. I'm at a loss. I really want to keep this phone but the main reason I need it is for the data! I live 45 minutes from work and I really need to be able to use maps ect.",

It does not have all the bells and whistles that an expensive phone has., it does have a few features that most mid range phones do have. Android 13 installed is a plus. Camera is good, not excellent.Good value!",
