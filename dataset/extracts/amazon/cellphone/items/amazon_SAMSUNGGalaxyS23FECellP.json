Don't worry that it's not the absolute newest processor. It is the same one used in last years flagships. This device functions exceptionally well. Super responsive and handles all video and multitasking with ease. Everything works great and the battery lasted all day which I haven't been able to enjoy in a long time. I also had no issue with the fingerprint scanner after applying a glass screen protector and toggling the switch in settings letting the device know that it has a screen protector. For those of you with AT&T, I was able to pop in my existing sim from family plan and the phone started thinking for a minute and then stated that it was configuring the network. After that it restarted and boom, connected with 5g and all. I got this phone for $599 and it also had a $100 Amazon gift card included as well. Just buy it, you won't regret it.",

                "reviewText": "It's heavier and a bit thicker than my Moto G which I had to replace due to broken screen. Wasn't worth fixing. It feels solid, dropped a couple of times and it survived, thankfully. Picture quality is awesome.Be warned, it does not have a headphone jack. Wish it did so that I could connect it to radios which do not have Bluetooth.Also, could not get the provider I wanted because their system did not have this on approved list yet. Had to choose another provider (Visible by Verizon.) ATT & Verizon recognized it with no issues. But, Spectrum did not (that's the one I wanted), neither did Metro PCS (T-Mobile), which both companies did sell the exact phone at a higher price, weird.Definitely faster than my old Moto G Stylus (2020), I can browse much easier and faster. And, the apps load up faster. I just think it's a bit too expensive for what it is.I maybe expecting too much, but battery life seems wanting. I really didn't put it to a formal test, but during the first days of setting up the phone I had to charge it a lot. Even now, I have to charge it once a day, and I mainly use it for using the apps to do minimal work. So, take my rating on battery life with a grain of a salt.",

                "reviewText": "Update; Received refund the day after I posted my review. Changed from 3 stars to an 5 star.Ordered this new phone as hubster's replacement phone. We had been searching for a while for just the right one, has great reviews and a fantastic price. We received the original order quickly, charged it and started the set up. The phone needed a PIN to log in and set up. We thought this was unusual for a new phone. Started a chat session w/Amazon Help Desk and w/in 5 minutes was told that it appeared to have been used by a customer, returned the item and we ended up receiving it in error. We were offered the return option so that we could purchase another one. We initiated the return process and mailed it out the next day. The return message on my Amazon account stated that we would be refunded when they received the device. I have been monitoring my emails and still have not received any notice or tracking info. I checked the tracking number thru UPS and it shows that the device was received 2 days ago. I logged into my Amazon account and the Refund Status shows the same info but I am not scheduled for my $500+ refund until more than 2 weeks away. Why would it take that long and why would they indicate that my refund would be issued upon their receipt? Very frustrating! The new device was easy to set up, long lasting battery, superb camera.",

                "reviewText": "Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because it doesn't come with a block, and the charger it comes with could be significantly better otherwise; it seems to be an amazing phone off the rip. I just switched back to android after years of being with Apple I got tired of my phone being outdated so quickly and the lack of user customization. I was looking at this phone for a bit because I wanted a galaxy and in the past my old androids when I was young would slow down and lag after a week of use. I haven't had this one for even a week yet but it's clearing all my worries thus far. My first worry was will it really be \"unlocked\" or will I have to go through a series of emails and returns to get one that accepts my Sim. Nope, popped my Sim in from my iPhone xr (I use cricket) it prompted me to restart the device so it could configure to it and boom. It even auto went to 5g shortly after (xr doesn't support 5g). There's that, I was also worried it would lag or skip like the cheaper androids I assume I had when I was younger but, man, this thing is smooth! I did a bit of extensive research and I was debating between this and a used s23 at the same price but after much debate and the risks of buying a used phone no matter who the seller is I landed back here and I don't regret it. All the good features as the flagships and none of the useless ones at half the price. Battery seems great thus far, just know that with every phone if you treat the battery with no care it will degrade so do a little research. Condition was amazing. Came packed in a loose box kind of but the phones packaging itself that was inside the box won't let anything happen to it. My only tip is buy a case when you buy the phone, it's very smooth and nice but also slippery and will fall out your pocket very easily between motions so keep that in mind. Hope I helped!
