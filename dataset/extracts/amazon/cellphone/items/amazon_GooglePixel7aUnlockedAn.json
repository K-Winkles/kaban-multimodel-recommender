                "reviewText": "I got this to replace my Samsung S10+. While this phone offers higher performance, better camera, etc., I don't care about (and haven't tested) those features.The primary reason I got this phone was Google offering automatic call screening for Pixel phones. I get about 20-30 scam calls a day, all from forged numbers. Yet I need to receive valid work or health-related calls, sometime from unknown numbers, so cannot simply block all unknown #s. Google's call screening is a lifesaver in allowing legit callers to get through or leave a message, but preventing 95%+ of the scam calls from interrupting my day. I estimate 15-20 minutes of time saved per day avoiding the interruptions.Otherwise I'm mostly happy with the phone, with a couple minor gripes.Positives:- Automatic call screening!- Generally good resolution, performance, etc.- Wifi - great Wifi 6 (802.11ax) throughput- Rooting - good standardized tools available (e.g. to allow advanced backup, call recording, etc.)Negatives:- Charging - slow relative to battery life. Easily takes 6-8 hours to charge to 100% from ~10% using wall charger (and much slower on PC or other USB)- GPS - surprisingly poor accuracy. Maps often beeps and reroutes, mistakenly thinking I took a turn that I didn't, or am on an adjacent road",

                "reviewText": "I have made it a habit to purchase every other Pixel \"A\" series phones, and each and every time I get great quality. Most people do not need a flagship phone, and this is one of the best phones out there. $499 + and Amazon gift card for $50? I'm there! Fast, very easy to set up from my old Pixel phone. From beginning to end, and installing a new E-Sim from Mint Mobile took about 90 minutes. Most of that time, I was reading a book. The process set my phone up exactly as my old phone was set up. All of the icons exactly where they were, the wallpaper exactly the same, settings the same. Bigger camera sensor and Google's famous computational photography means unparalleled photos. I only have two complaints about this phone: like all other phones, they are abandoning the earphone plug. Sad. If you're looking for great audio quality, Bluetooth isn't there yet. The second thing that I will miss is the fingerprint reader on the back. That was incredibly convenient. But now at least there is face unlock, and so far it seems to be working great! Not to mention it is stock Android - something that you don't get anywhere else! No unnecessary BS from a phone manufacturer like Samsung. Do not hesitate to purchase this phone- it is fantastic!",
