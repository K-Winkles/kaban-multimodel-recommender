This phone (only) takes a GSM SIM card because it is ATT and T mobile compatible. I went through 4 different SIM Cards with no activation luck so instead of going without a phone for 1 more day I went to Cricket Communications and they were able to activate this phone. I was able to keep my old phone number witch was surprising. Do your research before you spend your money and roll the dice on this item. GSM SiM card only. There are 3 Different types of SIM cards, make sure your carrier has one compatible that will work on this phone, has to be ( ATT & T-Mobile compatible.) This is a GSM phone.

                "reviewText": "I purchased this phone a bout a week ago. In my effort to move to this new phone I experienced a couple of issues. (1). The phone I received has a problem with the camera. Whenever I start to take pictures, I may be able to take one, maybe even two then I start getting a message about camera failure and I'm not able to take any pictures for a while and then somehow it clears up and I can can take maybe 1 or 2 pics again then the error happens again. Based on internet research, camera failure on this model seems to be a known problem. (2). I have my service with Verizon, when I switched to this phone, I could not use Verizon's visual voicemail service. I had to live with basic voice mail by dialing *86 and listening to my voice mails. This may be a Verizon issue, but I thought I should share it. Because of these two problems I have returned my phone for a refund.",

                "reviewText": "Bought a Used - Like New from Amazon Warehouse but instead got a renewed phone you find from a third party seller. it came in a brown box not in the original packaging like the description said and the phone upon inspection have scratches, really dirty charging port and speakers were dirty too having something like ear wax inside, camera have small scratches. And it's funny I got a Motorola brand wall charger and one of those cheap charging cables. Totally not the phone I bought and neither a renewed like it claims",
