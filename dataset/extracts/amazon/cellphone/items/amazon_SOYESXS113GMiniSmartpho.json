We wanted no games, no internet, no *nothin*, JUST access to one downloaded Spotify playlist offline and this thing is SO SMALL that nobody would ever look at it in her little hands and assume that it was once a real phone haha.I'm sure it's very fun and silly to use as an actual phone but it was the perfect thing for us to strip down to the bare minimum!",

It was smaller and lighter than I was expecting, really easy to jog with.I installed the music programs I liked and I put music on a 200gb micro SD card.I just went out for a 30 minute run and the battery went from 96% to 76%. I think I can keep this phone on standby for days provided it's on airplane mode; when it wasn't on airplane mode the battery went down quickly.The blutooth works great. I also paired it to a keyboard and that worked well too.Probably won't use it as a phone, especially since does not do 4g and battery would run out too quickly",

I put nova launcher, chrome, outlook, and microsoft teams. Works just fine. Keep in mind its battery and size make it impossible to be a daily driver. I don't have a sim in it so I can't talk about reception in this review. I use it for google voice and it's good enough but the phone speaker its self is quiet. So either use speakerphone, bluetooth for calls, or be in a quiet area. Video calls work just fine too. The camera on the back is kinda hilarious in the sense you can tell only 1 of the 3 cameras has a real lens over it but I didn't buy this phone expecting incredible pictures or anything, has functional front camera. It looks clean and pretty, does all basic functions. Also recommend you download the google keyboard instead of the stock one so you can type more accurately using the swipe function. Definitely gonna keep since I only need to answer phone calls on it, plays gameboy games great. Oh also hilariously enough it has hotspot capabilities as well if anyone needed to know lol.",

A lot of people complained about how hard the buttons are to press but what did you expect? Honestly.

                "reviewText": "Confession: I don't like smart phones, and I will never give up my flip phone for as long as I can.BUT. MP3 players just don't make sense these days when all the music is streaming, neither does carrying my laptop everywhere to listen to Spotify. So I needed something the size of an MP3 player but let me download my streaming services.And I found this. And a few others, but in price/review comparisons, I decided to go for this one.First, the screen protector was hard to get on, and I ended up trapping dust and air bubbles underneath. It does bug me a lot to at it, but I'm dealing.Second, as you can guess the buttons are TINY so it takes a lot of patience to type anything out, and sometimes I bring up the phone when I'm just trying to unlock it. Entering my Spotify and Wi-Fi passwords were a test in patience.But once I had everything I wanted set up, I was really happy with it. It connects to my Bluetooth headset without an issue, and I use everything with Wi-Fi. It's so small that everyone assumes it's a music player, and I can even fit in my tiny girl pockets. I read some reviews that the battery life is only 3 active hours, but I listened to music for almost two hours straight with it only being at 70%. But that's probably because I don't have the phone features or other apps up to drain the power.For someone who is smart-tech adverse, I really like this for the purpose I bought it. I hope that the brand selling will offer accessories soon, such as replacement screen protectors or various cases.",
