I had the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE prior to this one, but was ready to upgrade a little bit and this has been an amazing phone so far. It's very fast and runs great. I have noticed that it can run a little hot at times but not anything I'm super worried about. And it did come with a teeny tiny little chip in the top right corner but it is super hard to notice. It actually took me two days to realize it was even there so nothing to really complain about considering it is a used phone. Other than that one small tiny tiny blemish there are no others. No scratches on the screen or even the back. I'd definitely recommend buying this! It's definitely worth the price.",

Just need to get used to looking at the big red T-Mobile screen every time you reboot your phone. Being an apple user for many years there's a learning curve and some annoyances with the android apps but nothing that would deter me from getting it.",

But this time with this s21 fe it is a complete jackpot, man i got almost new phone with 99% battery health and there is no scratch or anything complete new, no problems with camera,mic,audio and whatsoever, the only thing i ask to be aware of before buying renewed phones is just strictly read rewiews carefully from sellers, there are different sellers for same phones and dont be sold for less price, there was 235 and 240 bucks option , i went with 240 and hit the jackpot cause i liked 240's seller reputation and will never regret that i didnt save some money before buying, the former one had like average rating, always go for top rating sellers",

                "reviewText": "Needed an upgraded phone for my son before he leaves for college. Phone arrived on time. It was packaged relatively well. Was able to activate it with our carrier (Verizon) with no issue. It did come unlocked (noticed in some of the reviews left that it didn't come unlocked). Reasons I give 4 stars instead of 5 is: I paid a little extra for a refurbished phone in 'excellent condition'. I would say this phone is closer to 'good condition'). It came with a noticeable scratch going across the top of the screen and some blemishes on the side of phone where the power/volume buttons are located. It leaves me wondering what a 'good condition' phone would've looked like and if it would've been worth getting instead for the extra savings. The package came only with the wall charger but no cable. Fortunately, he was able to use his cable from his old device. I was pleased to see that the key to unlock the SIM card slot was in the box. Overall, pleased with the purchase and would more than likely do this again when ready to upgrade device.",
