                "reviewText": "I purchased this phone for my 10 yr old kid as a \"TESTER\" phone.Positive: The phone looks/feel good and sturdy considering the price point, it came in a nice box with charging cable, power brick and a nice protective case for the phone.Negative: I have never had SO many issues trying to set up a phone. I recived it last night (1/17) and began what normally is a few minutes of set up. All seemed to be going ok until the phone shut down and restarted its self about 75% into the setup, and gave me the image(s) in this post. I assume it was user error so decided to donit all-over again. 4 more time; later, at approximately the same completion percentage, it did the same thing - I tried one final time and finally it worked! Let the phone rest over night, and today when setting up some apps for my kid, the phone froze in the middle of logging into Spotify, it restarted and gave me the same erro message I received 4 time yesterday.Maybe we go a Lemon, but regardless I will be returning it first thing to morning.Again, it appears to be a pretty good phone (if it works) but I also have to realize and taken into consideration what I paid for it.Please be cautious, and if you purchase this phone, I hope it works as intended for you.-Mike",
