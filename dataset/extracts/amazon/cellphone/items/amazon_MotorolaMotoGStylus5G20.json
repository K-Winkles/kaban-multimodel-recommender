                "reviewText": "After a few days, 5 stars!! Finally got rid of a used Samsung cause I hate Samsung phones. This Moto is just like the two Pixels I've had. Easy to use. Contact editing same as any Android. No sluggishness. Install all Android apps. Fingerprint reader on back. Stylus. Camera quality is awesome. I don't use Google to transfer data cause it seems to take too long and miss stuff. I used sms backup for my call and text data. I used a laptop to do my media and file transfer. I must note, at first I couldn't drag n drop data from old phone to new phone. In my case, I had to copy from old phone to the desktop, then cut and paste to new phone. Battery life quite good. Most phones will lose their battery life quality after a few charges. I have no complaints about this phone. $135 too!! I got the emerald green because I ordered a tough phone case which is blue for $10 which has a camera cover to prevent scratches. I will say, it takes a while for software updates to run it's course. I had 3 updates which went out 6 hours apart but it allows you to decide when to restart the phone. Great size screen. Audio even sounds good. I'm still a little old school so I love the headphone jack for headphones or plugging into an audio system without Bluetooth lag. If you're an Android lover, this phone is a steal of a deal.",

                "reviewText": "The information below still holds true. However, after several weeks with this phone, I actually like it better than my Samsung A54. When the screen is locked and off, you get these little information dots. Based on the dot symbol, I can tell whether it is a text from someone, or just a notification from an app.I can touch the little dot symbol, it will give me a little bit of information. I can swipe from that dot, to dismiss, close out or respond. I like that. Lastly, I have noticed the battery life is better than the Samsung A54. Not fantastic like my old Moto G Power, that would last three days easily, without needing a charge. But, this one last about 20% longer than the Samsung A54. Other than that, both phones (the Samsung A54 works just fine), are pretty good for the price.-------------This is an early review of the Moto G Power 5g-2023 model. Just got it yesterday.First, I have a Samsung A54, that I purchased least Christmas season and it works fine. No broken screen, no scratches. But the battery life on it (the A54) did not impress my at all. Felt the same about the Nord 10, which also is in perfect working condition.Realized that I had been spoiled. By my 4 or 5 year old, Moto G Power 2019 or 2020 phone. I could easily go three days, without having to worry about constantly looking at the battery state, with normal use.Yes, it still works, too! Oh yes, I wanted a headphone jack again, which the Samsung doesn't have.Yes, I have blue tooth headphones (not earbuds), but a set of good corded earbuds, is easy to take out of your pocket and pop into your eye, when you are mobile.So getting the new Moto G Power 5g 2023, at $200 was what I was waiting for. Here's what I have noticed:a. The screen is cleaner and brighter than my Samsung A54, at a lower setting.b. It is actually a little taller and thinner than my Samsung A54, and not at wide. So it is easier to hold in my hands.c. Charging time is similar when I put them on two chargers of the same brand, type and wattage.d. The front facing camera lens hole is definitely wider on the Moto G, I barely notice it on the Samsung.e. Setup was very easy. I connected a USB-C, cord between the Samsung and Moto G, and all of my account information was transferred. I could select NOT to transfer media from the old phone to the new one, since I had inserted, a micro sd slot into the new phone, with what media I always wanted to keep.f. The fingerprint reader is on the side of the phone, vs, in the screen like the Samsung. Which I actually prefer.Here are the disappointments:1. This phone is newer than the Samsung A54. Yet, when I did the Geek bench Test series on it, the final results were that the Moto G Power 2023 is about 20% 'slower' than the Samsung. Oh, according to Geek Bench, they have the same processor.2. I'm only seeing a slightly better battery performance than the Samsung, which is very disappointing, because of the POWER name, that is slapped on it. Definitely no where close to the battery longevity of my old Moto G Power 4g.3. When I tested the wifi speed, the Samsung A54, downloaded faster, by about 20%.4. This might be user error. But I can't figure out how to get 5 app icons in a row, compared to my other phones. The Samsung gives me a grid option, in home screen settings. But I do not see that in the menu of the Moto G Power 2023, even though they 'both' have Android 13.Yes, I know 5g drains the battery faster than 4g, when all things are the same. I didn't expect it to quite match my old Moto G Power. But I was extrapolating that it would be at least 30% better than the competing Samsung A54, which last about a day, before I have to recharge it. It seems 10% at best of an improvement.So if you have a Samsung A54, and you are looking for performance improvement, I would not buy this phone.BUT, if you have an older phone, like the Samsung A52 (which I had traded in for the Samsung A54), this is definitely a good upgrade at this price, since it was originally about $299. Especially, if you don't want to have to be bothered with wireless headphones, or fancy 'tiny' wireless earbuds, whose batteries, barely last a few hours.Perception-Someone with 'wired' earbuds walking around in public, are because of industry image, perceived as cheap. That is the image that I want.Will I return them? Nope, too much hassle and they do give me the headphone jack, that I wanted. But I know that POWER meaning of the past phones, is not the POWER meaning of the newer ones.Attached photo, sorry about it being sideway. The Nord plus phone is at the top (different wallpaper), the Samsung is in the middle and the Moto G Power at the bottom. Same wallpaper because it copied over in the transfer.That's it.",

                "reviewText": "I got this for WiFi use only and it\u2019s working well. I don\u2019t feel my daughter is old enough/mature enough for a phone. But I believe everyone should have access to music. We tried a mp3 player but it was annoying to put music on. And a really good mp3 player is hundreds of dollars. This was a cheap option and has parental controls. Unfortunately she can turn them off, luckily I would be notified. Proved it to her so she knows. It\u2019s working great so far with Apple Music family plan. When she\u2019s home she can download and look for new songs. On her walk to school or youth programs or doing chores or whatever she can easily listen to music. Slight issue with paring her head phones but that was a headphones issue. So all in all. I recommend if other parents are like me and looking for a easy cheaper way to get their kids music.I did have to make her a google account and then go into parent controls and link it to mine via her phone and then mine. And then downloaded an app on my phone(iPhone) to remotely control. Once I figured that out it was easy.Only small issue was setting her time to the right time zone. It lagged so I spent an hour trying to fix it. And then finally gave up but a few hours later it was magically on the right time zone.Happy with the purchase I got her a screen protector and an otterbox that came in the recommended add ons. Everything fits. So I recommend those products too.Oh and the apps and internet and everything else works well too without a SIM card when hooked only to WiFi. She get 30-1hr a day to surf the web bc she likes googling things. Animals, geology, astronomy, toys, when her shows and movies are going to release, her favorite characters to phone back grounds.She says the camera works really good and she already has a million pictures of our dogs. Next step is printing some.She also researched about the phone it\u2019s self and how to do things. Like we can put in her thump print and mine to access the phone. I guess next she\u2019s gonna research my iPhone to help me lolHer storage is filling up fast so we will be coming to that bridge when soon. Personally I think she needs to delete some photos and videos she made of her tv shows lol. But we have a lot of cloud storage through apple but idk yet how compatible that will be. I\u2019m sure she will research it.Good buy for a WiFi only option! I\u2019m thinking about getting one to keep in my purse for planning rather than my big planner that takes up so much space. And for music so I can not be interrupted during workouts. Bc I miss those days when people knew I was going to be unreachable and understood patience and not everything is an emergency lol. But we shall see. Lol",

I've never owed a \"high end\" phone and I'm really not sure what I'm missing. These so called budget phones work for me with speed and reliability. When I see an \"uptime\" of over 2000 hours, I know it's a rock solid phone. Really, the only time I re-boot is on an OS/security upgrade.The phone works well on Canada's Rogers network. I've had no issues crossing the border into the US. The camera works for my purposes and the Moto gestures are a great feature. The hatchet move to turn the flashlight on is used often as well as the rotate to start the camera.The only reason I replace these phones is the battery, like all phones they tend to lose their staying power after 3 years. I see no reason to replace batteries in old phones.I will continue to purchase Moto phones in the future.",
