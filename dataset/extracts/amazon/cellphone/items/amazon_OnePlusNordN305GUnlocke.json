                "reviewText": "Update:I no longer close myself out of apps (except just now, bc this phone has a twisted sense of humor). Like any new setup, it just took as little getting used to. I don't expect to upgrade for quite a while, but when I do, I probably won't even bother looking at other brands. OnePlus is the way to go - the Nord n30 feels and acts like a much more expensive device than it is.Original:I had never heard of the OnePlus brand until recently, but they seem to have a very good reputation. The Nord n30 kept topping the list of best lower-cost phones, so I took a chance and I'm so glad. My old phone was glitching a lot, basically acting like it was on the verge of total failure. I wanted to get something of reasonable quality, and fortunately, Amazon lets you pay in installments with no interest. That makes a big difference when money is tight, and at the holidays in particular.It's thin and light, and the screen is about as big as it can get without being ridiculous. That's perfect if you're 40+ and don't see as well anymore. The downside is that if you happen to have small hands, it may take some getting used to - it's just the slightest bit of a reach. The display is bright and beautiful, and it's super quick with no lagging. If you watch videos or listen to music you'll notice that the sound quality is amazing, particularly with earphones.I take a lot of photos, so the camera was important too. This one is very nice and I've gotten some excellent pics of the cat (and really, what else are cameras for?). I tested it on notoriously difficult holiday lights at night, and it did very well. Looking forward to landscapes and snow scenes. And more cat. The only thing that bugs me is I keep accidentally minimizing apps by swiping too close to the bottom where the functions are. That's something you have to acclimate to, but hopefully I'll get there soon.Overall this is an excellent choice if you want a high quality phone that doesn't cost half a month's rent.",

                "reviewText": "I'm conflicted even writing this but here goes.... This thing is impressive for the price paid.I am a HUGE Samsung fan. I HATE Apple. I always spend the most money for the newest phone with as much memory as offered. My thought being it will last until the next time I need a phone. It will remain relevant, the tech won't be obsolete, and presumably I'm buying a quality product.That mentality has served me well... Until it didn't. My S22 Ultra is having connectivity problems. We'll it really isn't that old and I owe $700+ on it still. So I was in a tough spot, fixing it means a bill probably North of $300(maybe more) and then I would still owe the money on top of it. I didn't thi k either option was right. Paying it off seemed too expensive. Fixing it seemed silly, and ultimately too expensive.So in the short term I went and found the cheapest phone I could stomach. A Motorola something or other for $150. It had 4G of RAM which caused Microsoft Teams to not even start on my phone. It just instantly crashed. So for awhile I just used that as my Hotspot for my Samsung (which had its drawbacks for sure).That isn't working. Alright I can still return this Motorola. What else for a little more money might be better? A refurb? Nope... Still $300+ in anything I would accept. I read. I researched. I finally come to the One Plus. Lots of nice things are said about the phone and fresh of my recent \"cheap phone\" experience, let's just say I was dubious.It goes on sale for $230. Alright for $230 I'll bite.I got to tell you... For a $230 it's hard to gripe. Is it perfect? NOPE. is it a flagship Samsung phone. NOPE. For $230,I give it some grace. RAM 8G which is so so, it supports virtual RAM up to 16G. Not as good as real RAM but MORE than serviceable. 128G of memory alright that's not great but guess what... It supports an SD card. Boom. Doesn't matter. The OS is largely free of anything I hate. It's functional. Some quirks here and there... But I adjusted pretty darn quick. The quick charge battery may be worth it alone. This thing just amazes me how quickly it charges. Is it good for the batteries longevity? I doubt it. However at $230, I don't really care. I am a POWER USER, a 5,000ma battery is good. Still not good enough for me. I figure I'd need a 10,000ma battery maybe a little more to meet my demands. The fast charge though, it gets lower than I like, blast it with the supercharger, 20 minutes later and I'm back in the game. The finger print scanner, I didn't think that it would be natural or useful where it is on the side. Not true. Dang thing works flawlessly always.True downsides. The camera... It surely isn't a Samsung. Now, I'll give it props, in full light and still photos it's adequate. Not great, but it does the job. In the dark though... Oi oi oi.... Hot garbage. The screen gets bright, it really does, but it needs to be brighter, by... Shoot I don't know: 25-35%. It's manageable though. I honestly think those are my only gripes.Its responsive and plenty fast at running the things I need it to do. I'm kind of shaken up about it because I'm not sure at this point I'll maintain my same theory about phone ownership. At $230 for.... 70% of the goodness let's say, I have a hard time thinking that $1400 for a new phone makes a lot of sense. Bravo One Plus. This is impressive.",
