You know when u put ur ID in that see through part of your wallet and BAM it\u2019s stuck??? NOT ANYMORE. You got those long beautiful nails(acrylic or other)?? EASY AS HELL to get your card now! They are easily removable, so if u go to a one of those atms that takes your card into the machine, you can take it off and put it right back on. I have bought several as gifts and I get ALOT of compliments from anyone who sees them. If you are pondering if you should buy it, I\u2019m the angel on your shoulder saying DO IT 1000/10 recommend \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
