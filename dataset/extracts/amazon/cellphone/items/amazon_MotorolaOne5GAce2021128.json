I should\u2019ve left it alone but I tried to program it and one of the first options was to upgrade the operating system from 10 to operating system 11 which we did. It appears that whoever serviced and boxed and shipped this particular phone tried to install Samsung operating system and the phone was a nightmare from the get-go. The second phone was wonderful, easy to set up, loved it and then suddenly \u2014 without warning \u2014 it had connectivity issues with the telephone, couldn\u2019t make phone calls, wouldn\u2019t receive phone calls, wouldn\u2019t acknowledge phone calls. T-Mobile techs had no solutions whatsoever for us. We are in the process of returning these two Refurbished phones and we have ordered two brand new Motorola One 5G Ace phones. We trust Motorola but if we ever find out who Refurbished and sent us those phones, we will never trust them again.",
