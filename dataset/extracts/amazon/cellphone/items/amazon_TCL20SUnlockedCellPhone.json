Good luck using a navigation app. Can't pinpoint your location (seems to be above 50mph is the worst). But unless I find a solution to this quick, the phone will be going back. As someone who uses navigation apps very frequently, not being able to has caused a lot of issues",

I called the support center and I received a return authorization for the phone. The phone was repaired and returned to me eight days after I sent it in for service, which I consider excellent response.",

However, I still regret my purchase, because this is definitely the worst Android implementation I've ever used. There are all kinds of little annoyances that make the phone difficult to use. I think some of them are caused by the phone's every aggressive limitation on processes running in the background. This means that it randomly disconnects from my home wifi network several times a day, and it's impossible to have a weather app that auto-starts and updates the temperature for you, and that none of the shake-flashlight apps will work. I wanted this phone to last a while but I think it's going to drive me nuts sooner or later.",
