                "reviewText": "Wanting to change service providers, since the previous never notifies me when minutes, texts, or air time are getting low or are about to expire, I looked for something that was compatible with Mint Mobile and this phone works very well for it. Unlike most, I'm not much of a phone user. I do everything on my desktop for several reasons whenever possible. Still, I use the phone solely for communication purposes, mainly just for calling and occasional text messages and very rarely anything else.Normally, for photos, I use my DSLR as it's greatly superior to just about everything for photos. I've used the camera on this phone a few times, and it's of grade C quality. There are some modest strong points but also some modest weak points. It only goes to 1/15 second for the longest shutter and performs very poorly in low light conditions, also having low contrast. For daylight stuff, it performs quite well though I can see some odd blurring effects even when setting the self timer and resting the phone up against a rock for perfect stability. It's probably the image compression though I'm unsure (JPG using 2x1 subsampling may explain it, instead of the very sharp 1x1). Strangely, there's no control for adjusting the aperture on it (nearly every lens has aperture adjustment, often something like f/3.5 to f/16 or f/22). It may be a software limitation for what's built in. The autofocus is of high quality in daylight settings and bright indoor settings and I love the panorama mode (though it doesn't work for moving scenes such as water waves).",

                "reviewText": "I got this smartphone to replace my old iPhone 6s since I wanted to try an Android Smartphone this time. I found several brand new phones from TCL news and eventually chose the A30 one.The phone and its battery were seperately placed in the package box when it was delivered. It was quite easy to assemble the battery into the phone. You can even do that without the quick start guide. The package is also pretty which does not look like just a $100 phone.The cellphone's processing and operations run really smoothly and quickly. You can open multiple apps one time and it will not affect its speed. I downloaded several newly released games such as Diablo Immortal and Genshin Impact, and all of them operated smoothly. The only concern is that the smartphone does not come with an additional RAM disk and it only has 32GB storage. So if you would like to download a lot of games or large apps, I would recommend you to buy another disk and insert it into the phone. A30 does provide a place to insert another memory disk.In addition, it supports multiple Google apps which had been pre-installed on the phone. You don't need to spend a lot of time to find the apps and install them. The battery is also very long-lasting. I used it to play Genshin Impact for several hours with all best graphic setting, it still had much power left.Overall, it's worthy with only $100 to get this impressive phone. If you have a budget plan for your smartphone, I would strongly recommend this TCL A30.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for my daughter who was 13 at the time. It is definitely a cheaply made phone. We have always purchased Samsung Galaxy phones until this one. We purchased because it was a smaller smartphone and my daughter liked that.The phone feels plastic-y and flimsy. The entire time she used it, it was a little glitchy and didn't always connect to the cellular network very well (to be fair, though, she only had 500MB 4g data each month, that then dropped to 2g for the remainder of the month). Her sister's hand-me-down 2016 iPhone has faster connections. The glitchiness was mostly annoying, so we managed it. The battery life was good. Until it wasn't.A few days ago, the phone stopped charging - it was giving a \"low battery temperature\" warning and wouldn't charge. If plugged in while turned off, the phone would say \"Error! Please plug out charger!\" Clearly, they are missing some quality control if their grammar is not correct.It was easy to get a hold of tech support at TCL, after doing a factory reset, the issue persisted. They offered to warranty it because it was within a year of purchase, but wanted me to pay $20 for the shipping. That is 25% of what I paid for it.I learned my lesson: TCL = Bad. Stick with Samsung.",

                "reviewText": "Let's start with what I like about this item.The cost is first, the lowest cost wins.The phone does work and runs all apps.Now for the dislike of the phoneSlow, like I'm not a flagship phone snob but this is stupid slow. Also need to mention that it may not happen often but apps will quite often simply close when using. Like it starts a task inside the app (open keyboard, microphone, tab switch, that type of thing) will simply cause it to close.Any app that you open will take at minimum 3 seconds to load and about 10 seconds longer if it is a bulky app. Once in an app you do any action and you must wait 1-2 seconds while it processes.If you restart it takes almost 3-5 minutes to load upTheir branding throughout the software resulting in many features being removed such as theme colors and settings.Good thing this is simply a backup phone and would recommend doubling your price and simply getting a phone worth the money. I've been using a Pixel 6a the last few years and refurbished they are around $200 and are snappy and have 128GBs of space dwarfing what you get with this flimsy phone.Overall - If this is a daily use, I would recommend saving your money and saving up for a better one. If it is simply to replace a phone or for a Kid, this would be ideal.",
