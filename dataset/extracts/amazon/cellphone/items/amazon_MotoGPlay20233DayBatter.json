                "reviewText": "The best part of this phone is it gets workable signal when others seem not to be able to do so.Any phone can run apps but most have lousy RF performance. The RF performance of this phone seems to allow it to get a workable signal where other phones do not. I was often in areas which seemed to have no to marginal coverage. Now with this phone they all seem workable. Casually comparing its performance to other kinds of phones in use in the same area by others on various networks, this phone will typically be able to make calls when others cannot. It is clearly better than the phone it replaced. Perhaps it is realted to Motorola being an old line radio company. Who knows. But it is a superior RF performer.I tested using different SIM cards and it works with both Verizon and T-Mobile (a GSM carrier) networks. This is pretty unusual because most phones are either Verizon or GSM but not both. The phone is advertised as working with ALL US carriers and this seems to be a good claim. Maybe the thing is an SDR? Wouldn't that be nice.The wifi section has both 2.4 and 5 Ghz bands. Both work very well. Using a directional beam as the access point I was able to get a workable 2.4 link at about a half mile. If you want to play with this I used a Ubiquiti Powerbeam PBE M2 400 which you can get on Amazon.The phone is also very stable, having not yet crashed after a few months of use. The phone comes with Android 11, which is very good and it will ask you to upgrade to 12. Both versions are excellent and stable on this phone. There are no hangs or crashes.The memory holds all the apps I need and is only about 60% used. Battery life can go way past two days if you are just on standby and have all the saver features turned on. The two days is with \"normal\" use as in my kind of normal use versus playing games or watching video all day. Charging is quite fast and considering you can run a day with far less than 100% battery, the time to refresh the battery is quite quick.The camera is average, which in my case is good enough, but keep in mind it's a cell phone. If you want to do real photography get a DSLR.For the money you will not find a better deal. There is no way I would pay $1200 for a phone especially when I can get 90% of the way there for 5% of the cost.Mot has really done a great job. I hope they keep up the great work because we need solid, good performing phones at this cost level.If you want a phone that just works and does so very well and don't care about fashion, get this.",

                "reviewText": "Good phone, all is good once you figure out what bogs it down. I know this phone doesn't have much ram and I wasn't wanting to pay a huge price for a phone with huge amounts of ram. Onboard storage I'm not crazy about, it is a bit short in that area, but even that can be controlled by using a SD card for all other storage and is fairly easy to change where any downloads or pictures go. This phone does bog down some but it's not so much a phone issue as it is a android issue, app ram hogs. I would highly recommend going to app settings and eliminating as much app permissions as possible and force stop apps you more likely won't use. It's what I did and once I did it, it made a huge difference. This is a Android 12 issue, not a phone problem. Today's apps love that memory, once you reduce the apps usage you spare more ram for loading apps you do use. Phone is nice, works great, finger print reader works really well and side buttons are easy. It doesn't have all the bells I'd like to have but it's also not expensive so I can deal with it for the price. One thing I don't like that it should have is a charging light, so to check it the screen must be on. I can't give it 5 stars as I just got it, but 4 should work as it's a Motorola, a brand that has a good reputation so at least it's worth 4 stars anyways, and hopefully I can keep it at 4 at minimum.",

                "reviewText": "Moto G Stylus 2023: Terrible DisappointmentI recently purchased the Motorola Moto G Stylus 2023, and I must say, it has been a complete disappointment in every aspect. This phone fails to deliver on its promises and falls short in terms of performance, design, and functionality. Here's why I strongly advise you to avoid this device:Lackluster Performance: The Moto G Stylus 2023 is painfully slow and sluggish. It struggles to handle even basic tasks like opening apps or browsing the internet. The overall user experience is frustrating, and you'll find yourself waiting for ages just for simple actions to complete. It's as if the phone is stuck in the Stone Age!Inferior Build Quality: The build quality of this phone is subpar at best. It feels cheap and flimsy in hand, lacking the premium touch you'd expect from a modern device. The materials used are of low quality, making it vulnerable to scratches and damage. Moreover, the design is uninspired and outdated, making the Moto G Stylus 2023 look like a relic from the past.Mediocre Camera Performance: Despite the marketing hype surrounding its camera capabilities, the Moto G Stylus 2023 fails to deliver impressive results. The photos captured are often grainy, lack detail, and suffer from poor color accuracy. The supposed \"stunning\" low-light performance is nothing but a marketing gimmick, as the images turn out noisy and unusable. If you're looking for a phone with a good camera, this is definitely not the one.Frustrating Software Experience: Motorola's software experience on the Moto G Stylus 2023 is a nightmare. The device is loaded with bloatware, which not only eats up valuable storage space but also slows down the phone even further. The user interface is cluttered and unintuitive, making it difficult to navigate through the menus. Updates are infrequent, leaving users stuck with outdated features and security patches.Lack of Display Quality: The display on the Moto G Stylus 2023 is a letdown. It lacks vibrancy, and colors appear washed out. The resolution is mediocre at best, resulting in a pixelated viewing experience. Whether you're watching videos, playing games, or simply browsing the web, the display fails to provide an immersive visual experience.In conclusion, the Motorola Moto G Stylus 2023 is an absolute disappointment in every aspect. From its poor performance and inferior build quality to its underwhelming camera and frustrating software experience, this phone simply falls short of the competition. There are far better options available in the market at similar price points. Save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere for a reliable and feature-rich smartphone.",
