So going live you look decent if you want to look more clearer. Find a phone with similar specs. That has a better MP front camera. For gaming and streaming. The phone doesn't get hot or lag. I Highly recommend these phones. I have 2 and buying 5 more soon.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to write this review because there are entirely too many reviews from people who seem to have no clue how an Android smart phone works.This is a budget Android device, capable of providing at least some level of 4G service on all US Carriers (search for this phone model on kimovil.com). I can\u2019t speak for service in other countries, but that site provides data on that, as well.It is not a high-end smart phone, so if you\u2019re expecting performance on par with the latest iPhone or Samsung device, increase your budget several hundred dollars.That said, at this price point, it\u2019s a very nice phone. The fingerprint sensor on the power button is a surprisingly unexpected delight, as you can easily make your unlock finger your thumb, which would naturally sit on this button in most situations. As this was a new number for me, the setup was very quick (no importing files from a previous device), but I\u2019ve found the device to be snappy as a whole. The double sim threw me off and I didn\u2019t immediately recognize the nano sim slot was exactly that. Once I looked over this product again and realized that it was there, I put my sim (GoogleFi) in with no issues, and GoogleFi pretty quickly put my phone online (just their normal start up stuff). Speaking of, that \u201ctiny wire\u201d another reviewer complained about is the standard sim removal tool, and the phone did come with a manual but...If you have a need for a very inexpensive Android phone that just works, I would definitely be comfortable recommending this one.",
