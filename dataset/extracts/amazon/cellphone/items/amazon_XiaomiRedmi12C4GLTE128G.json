                "reviewText": "Phone: was fast and nice.Screen is very sensitive and the camera good, but not as good as the 9C.The camera had a very different tone of color, more gray than the 9C Xiaomi,Same speed as the 9C.The only thing that was suposed to make this model better was the camera, but it didn't.Seller:I ordered the Xiaomi 12C phone from this seller with the confidence that it would work with my mobile carrier, as guaranteed in the listing. However, when I received the phone, I discovered that it was not compatible with my SIM card. I immediately contacted the seller to request a product return.The seller accepted the return but attempted to charge me restock fees, justifying them by claiming that the phone had been opened. I can't help but notice that the phone had to be opened for testing, as the seller had advertised compatibility that turned out to be false. I contested these fees and repeatedly asked the seller to remove them, but I was ignored.After numerous unsuccessful attempts, I contacted Amazon customer service to report this scam. Despite Amazon making several inquiries to the seller, they ignored the requests and charged an unjustified fee.Ultimately, Amazon had to step in and offer me insurance to cover the costs of this fraud. This experience was extremely frustrating and cost me both time and money.I want to emphasize in the strongest terms possible how vital it is to steer clear of this seller. Their actions are nothing short of deceitful and fraudulent. I hope my review can help other buyers avoid similar issues and choose more honest sellers.",
