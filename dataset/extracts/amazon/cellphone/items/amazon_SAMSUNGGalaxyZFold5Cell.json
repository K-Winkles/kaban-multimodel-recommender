                "reviewText": "So I've been using Motorola phones the past five or so years, buying a new one every 18 months or so to get an extra 2gb of ram to boost the speed of the android operating system. These phones were mid tier at best phones bought for 200-300 dollars each time. They always got the job done but I was never impressed by the speed of the phone, often times running Facebook by itself would run slow let alone multiple apps would stall the phones a ton.So over 4-5 years I bought 4 phones for about $1,2000 total, figuring each time I was owning a phone almost as fast as a Samsung for 1/5 the price. I run an Etsy and Ebay business now and my phone is my life. On my Motorola everything was average, the camera, the processor, the ram, the battery, etc.So I had been researching these new Samsung phones, especially the S23+ Ultra and this Z Fold 5, and feel in love with everything I saw, including the reviews. After owning mid tier phones for half a decade I guess I simply forgot there's a reason why if you love Android over IOS you go with Samsung.Pricey, sure it is. But my God, the display is a thing of beauty to start. The speed is also so incredible I forgot what it was like to multi task on a phone in Nana seconds with absolutely no lag. Samsung truly knows how to build a superior product and it's worth every penny!!12 gb of ram make this thing run multiple applications at once without any problem. In settings there's even an extra mouse that takes 8gb of your internal memory and turns it into more ram, which is icing in the cake.The phone itself is extremely solid and hard to break or Crack. I bought the case with the s pen built into it and love the features and case. Folding it out to watch you tube videos feels like in using a tablet whenever I want, as well as running multiple apps side by side flawlessly.The camera is super impressive with the 50mp option that really helps me take great photos of my vintage products I sell. Couldn't be happier.The only, single complaint, if I dare call it that, would be the battery life is very similar to the moto phones I owned before. Even if I only use the front screen it doesn't last as long as I expected. Luckily it comes with a special charger that literally takes it from 20% to 100% in line 40 minutes, so I'm satisfied as a whole with the battery, not enough of a problem to not give it 5 stars.Thanks Samsung, I now remember what is like to have lightning fast operating system, to get every actual notification correctly, a screen to watch movies and videos that's amazing, a Samsung one OS that makes the fold out screen work flawlessly with multiple apps, and settings for every tiny thing possible.I spent $1,500 instead of $300 on a moto, but I'm sure this phone will last me 3-5 years easily. Definitely recommend this product.5 of 5",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect phone for me",
                "reviewText": "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, as they say. For this phone, I believe it is especially true. If you have an use case that fits it's form factor and specs, then you'll be the happiest camper. In case contrary, you might find yourself with a phone that is more annoying than helpful.I travel quite a bit, need to work on the go, and love to read comics and books. For many years, I've traveled with a tablet (for reading), a laptop (for working), and a phone. I've switched in the airport waiting room and on my seat from one to the other, scrambling to put things away, and having more devices than I'd like going through security. This phone absolutely solves that. I haven't practically used my tablet since I got it and the laptop stays in my bag at the airport and on the plane.By the way, the unfolded phone surface is very similar to a Kindle, so it is a superb replacement for one, especially with the dark theme, that causes less strain to the eyes.Additionally, I used to carry my tablet to the table to watch Netflix while I eat, I colored and drew on my tablet to relax, and I played games on the bigger tablet screen rather than the phone. This phone solves for all that.I like that is narrow, it's easy to hold. When I run outside, I typically carry my phone in my hand so it doesn't bounce in my pockets. This is a very comfortable phone to do that. I had an iPhone 8 Plus before, and it got uncomfortable after a certain time.There is only one drawback that I've found so far. I also go to a climbing gym a couple of times per week. I used to bring my old phone with me and listen to podcasts while I climbed. I didn't care because it was an old iPhone 8. This phone stays in the locker when I go climbing because a) it's not a cheap/old phone, and b) I am concerned the chalk I use for climbing might damage the interior screen.Typing in the narrower screen might take some getting used to, but it is not too annoying, to be frank.I've only had the phone for a few weeks, and I am still learning all there is to it, but for now, it really seemed to have been designed for me. Super happy with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Samsung Care+ is allowed to be purchased within 60 days of a new phone purhcase from any vendor. Right after I received the phone, I went through their ridiculous process to take special angle photos of the phone and paid for a warranty.A week later (they promise 24 hours but couldn't do that), they email they cannot warranty the phone. No reason. After some calls and digging, they claim the phone is damaged.The photos from out of the box are crystal clear, not fuzzy, and have no odd reflections or elements. Some person who can't do their job well has blocked me from getting a warranty on something so expensive. It may be discriminatory from my name. Regardless, there is no recourse.Lifelong Samsung purchaser of all types of devices - done. Selling them off over time and no more of my money to an unethical company. No such thing as customer service nor customer loyalty these days.",
