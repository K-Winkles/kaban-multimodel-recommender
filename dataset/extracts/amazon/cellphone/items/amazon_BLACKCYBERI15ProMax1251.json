First you get everything included- charger, earphones, and a clear phone case for this insane price. It is much more sleek than the picture they advertised with. Performance and sound quality is top notch better than my known brand android. Storage is 5 times my old phone and this would have cost x4 for me to upgrade to with my android. I highly recommend this phone!",

I went to a store to get a case and the guy there said, I don't know what this is but it is NOT an i15 PM. I bought a case online for an i15PM and it was a 1/4\" to short. I have been to 2 other stores trying to find a case but they are all the same, too small. Now I know why it comes with a case. It is nothing fancy, just a clear rubber case but it's a case",
