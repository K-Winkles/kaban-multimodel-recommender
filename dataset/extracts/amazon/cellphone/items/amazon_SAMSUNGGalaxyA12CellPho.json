                "reviewText": "So I had to get this phone due to my last one dying, this one had AMAZING reviews and stats so I ordered it.It was great in the beginning, camera wasnt all as great as it claimed to be, but then suddenly my screen would turn off and never come back on.Digging I found that these phones are known to have issues where the internal hardware for the screen is buggy and you literally have to massage your phone to get it working again, it got annoying taking it out of it's case just to massage it every time it bumped on anythingIt's been a lil over a year since I've had the phone and the issue has gotten way way worse. To the poibt where not even that helps anymore, it now affects the fingerprint sensor and overall the phone is very very buggy due to the screen issueI figured giving it a full year test run would be fair to the phone so I knew how to handle quirks and stuff when it came time to review so I could be helpful and still praise up the phoneBut I simply HAVE NO praise for this phone, anything that is appraisable is just because it's simply an android feature, the phone isn't that special and the camera is only half good, you can get phones cheaper with better quality and without the hardwiring issuesBest to just simply avoid buying this phone and buy something else imo",

                "reviewText": "I researched before I purchased, having found that Samsung phones supported Wifi calling - although not listed in the product description of this particular phone. Well, I wish I could remember what sight that info was on, because it's the farthest thing from the truth! I even went into the At&T Store and asked which models support it --- they didn't even have any..... I ended up finding a Google Pixel 3 - which per Amazon's \"Ask and Answer\" was reported to have supported WiFi calling. I work from home, in my basement..... and access to WiFi calling is essential. I can't believe how hard it was to find a new cell phone with this feature. I am thankful that Amazon has an amazing return policy - as this phone and the case I purchased are headed back.",
