The guy at cricket did something in settings..not sure if that did it or not. But he said he put it on \"text only\" this disabled the internet. Either way I did not want my 10 y.o. to have internet and whatever he did...it worked. My dtr is able to call, text, take pics and text them. We haven't tried uploading music from our computer yet, but that will be next. For her little use, the battery lasts a long time. Great phone for anyone like me who wants access to your kid without the worry of the internet. Hope this helps. Oh, and she LOVES the keyboard feature.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this phone for my mother who had trouble adapting to her new touch screen only Android smartphone. She really missed her physical qwerty keyboard, and only uses her phone for texting and voice calls. This was the only phone, other than a Blackberry, that had the required physical qwerty keyboard. It was a pain to transfer her contacts and photos (apparently she uses the camera too). The contacts had to be exported from the Android phone in a csv format. Then imported, INDIVIDUALLY, on this phone. It took about an hour to import her 260 contacts! When importing, this phone truncated the names, making some of them hard to identify. Camera quality is poor. The proprietary OS is clunky and going between the touch screen and physical keyboard to do things is far from intuitive or even natural. I think mom will adapt, but don't think she is very happy with this phone. Maybe i'll check out a blackberry for her.",

It worked fine and I hope it stays working. To all of you that are not phone savvy be-careful with your phone purchase online some are no longer compatible with 4G and you will end up returning the phone.

It was difficult to tell from the picture, but I had to try it out, nevertheless. Perhaps this phone would fit a teenager's fingers? The main reason I wanted to have this phone was for the actual keyboard instead of a touch screen keyboard. I returned this phone due to the small keyboard, so I honestly didn't bother with testing out the touch screen or picture quality features. The actual phone was very comfortable (except for the keyboard), compact, lightweight, but solidly constructed. My experience with LG phones have been excellent. They are built to last. My current phone is an LG. Slider phones are cool anyway. I guess it brings out the \"geeky\" side of my personality ;-)",

However, after two weeks, it developed a strange pixalation problem in the form of black dots and lines, like a tatoo across the screen. It was within the 30 day return window, so I sent it back, fearing the problem would get even worse over time.ProsSeemed well-made; nice size; good keyboard.ConsDeveloped a screen problem; was a pain to set up to send and receive picture texts; could not delete obnoxious ATT bloatware, including ATT addresses that popped up as the first 7 addresses in the contacts.Verdict: Always get things like this Fulfilled by Amazon to benefit from their great return policy.",

                "reviewText": "I have this phone for about 3 weeks now and I am very happy that I finally decided to buy this phone to replace my old broken phone. This one seems to work perfectly and since it was unlocked I was able to just switch my old SIM card to this one and I had all my contacts saved and was able to keep my cheap plan and my number. I find it a bit harder to type on this one than on my old phone but that is probably just a matter of getting used to a new keyboard. The touch screen seems to work perfectly, which is something I was worried about. I will try to update if I have any problems later on.",
