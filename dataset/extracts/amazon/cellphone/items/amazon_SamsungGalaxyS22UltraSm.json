Screen and body had no scratches or marks on it. The phone arrived on schedule and was well packaged. I was able to connect to my carrier without any trouble. It is quick, has a beautiful picture and pretty good battery life. I have been running on the highest display settings, so it would probably be even better on battery use at a lower setting. It also takes really amazing pictures. It will likely take me a long time to work my way through all the features. I love this phone. I would definitely buy from this seller again and would recommend this phone to anyone considering it.",

Amazons India help center even said as much.I had to return two of these for defects but love the third one. First one did a crash dump updating Android and occasionally acted strange after that. Second one had an ever-present circle in the lower middle of the screen. Turns out it was the fingerprint sensor, and it did not work right.Accidentally returned both damaged phones to one vendor on duplicate ticket (on pain killers from a surgery) . Vendor refunded theirs and who knows what they did with other vendors phone because they will not respond to inquiries. Again, Amazon will NOT help, which is very unusual.",
