Compared to a G Power 2021, higher resolution LCD means sharper images and it shows best in texts. Speedwise its about the same as the G Power, since Stylus is a Mediatek vs Power's Snapdragon. It has a stylus but I just use my finger. Took several hours to upgrade the firmware to the most recent version, as it went through each upgrade spanning a year, finally to Sept 2023, then nothing since then. Solid performer, no lags, lockups, quick response. Battery life 3 days in my use.Main con is no Turbocharger for charging, its 25% slower.",

I'm going from a Motorola e6 to this and the difference is HUGE!It is a bit big (duuh).At the moment I have DLS23, FC Mobile, Lightning Link games and other banking apps etc. installed and it handles it very well. No lagging.I have the phone for 3 weeks and have no issues.Calls are clear, the speaker is ok, it has more low end and sounds clearer compared to the other phone.What I like the most is the DOLBY ATMOS app! Music sounds zoo much better with this on!Battey life, I don't know about the 2 day, cause if you play games a lot it will drain it.For now, I'm charging it once daily and I play games about 2-4 hours a day on it.So for my needs, it is a good phone overall!",

                "reviewText": "If you like to frequently use Google Assistant with your phone's screen turned off, or unlock your phone using your voice, this is not the device for you. After spending weeks retraining it with my voice, searching for solutions online, checking settings, etc. I finally found a post today stating that Google has disabled those functions on this phone and a lot of others, supposedly for security reasons.It's a nice phone otherwise; great screen, takes great photos, plenty of space, and so forth...but not being able to ask it from across the room, \"hey Google, what's the temperature?\" while I'm getting dressed or \"remind me in 5 minutes to check dinner\" or other things like that is almost a deal-breaker for me.",
