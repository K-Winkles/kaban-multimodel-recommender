Easy to switch from the old 3g phone to the 4g phone. Navigation is almost exactly like my Samsung phone. Picture quality is very good and the battery life is very good as well. I didn't want to spend a fortune ,so the $189 phone with so many features and mostly good reviews was right for me. Hope it continues. We'll see.",

                "reviewText": "A week after getting the phone, I was pretty angry, as I could not get it to make phone calls, even though on here they said it would work. So I started the process to return it, and the morning right before I was about to take it and drop it off at an Amazon locker, an update was pushed through, and low and behold, I could make phone calls. So at the moment, I'm happy and excited (it's been a month and a half since I could call anyone). The phone itself is pretty nice, especially for the price. Lots of settings to configure, it's exhausting. Definitely get a good case for it. I'm afraid one drop is all it will take to break it. Overall, was not happy, but now I'm content. Except it keeps turning off my antivirus, but i'm sure i'll figure it out eventually. Ughhh, technology!!",

                "reviewText": "Like:-TCL implementation of Android on this phone is uncluttered, intuitive, quick.-Bloatware is minimal or non-existent.-Display is excellent-Speedy interactions, no lag. I don't use for gaming, just social media, internet browser activity, calls, messaging, calendar, 2-factor auth device, other basic online stuff. 5G is not something I need to pay extra for at this stage of its rollout as there is limited coverage where I live so I'll wait for 5G to \"mature\" before paying more for a phone that supports it.Cons:-Button for Google Assistant is on left side directly opposite the \"sleep\" button on the right side, so, when I'm holding the TCL in my right palm and press the \"sleep\" button with my thumb, my opposing grip on the left side activates Assistant unless I'm very careful. An irritant.My wife bought an equivalent phone at a bit higher price from a different manufacturer that has 5G capability, but we had to jump through hoops tweaking the settings to get MMS data working so she could receive texts containing pictures. Plus, its Android implementation has a less intuitive \"feel\" to me. As I said, I like this TCL 20.Overall, for my needs, I like this Android phone better than any that I've had before.",

                "reviewText": "Got my wife a \u2018TCL 10 SE\u2019 in November 2020 because Consumer Cellular was sending notices of an incompatible phone soon as they transitioned to 5g network. Her phone was on a t-mobile network and kept working after the conversion, my old phone was not only incompatible but unable to work on the \u20185g\u2019 network or on the \u20184g VoLTE\u2019 as well. As if that was not enough At&t Consumer Cellular network in my area was having issues working with \u20184g VoLTE\u2019 and the \u2018TCL 20 SE\u2019 I had just gotten for myself.Chatted with Consumer Cellular for help but was a no go for \u2018At&t Consumer Cellular\u2019 though they said I could buy a \u2018t-mobile Consumer Cellular\u2019 SIM for 10 dollars and have it set up for my new \u2018TCL 20 SE\u2019. Worked like a charm and they reimbursed the 10 dollar from the next bill.For a budget phone I have only few a complaints. Miss my blinking message indicator light. Still can not figure how to set a custom text only sound. Bluetooth drops on my vehicle after 30 seconds but comes back, only time will tell if a prolong drive would be an issue.After thought: Phone is smooth to use. Finger print login works well. And it is not overloaded with apps. I use Linux at home and \u2018warpinator\u2019 file sharing app works great. Even though phone is not \u20185g\u2019 it work with \u20184g VoLTE\u2019 that will be in used for longer than I will own the phone. Camera also works much better than my old phone.",

                "reviewText": "When I first got this device i found some very nice features it had compared to my previous phones, loved how user friendy it was and the fact that i could cast my phone content to my TCL tv. It has a decent camera and it ran pretty good.... until i mishandled it and it went to the ground on my driveway and the screen cracked... it still worked bit obviously I just couldn't go through life with a cracked screen so I replaced it (\"new\" replacement screen didnt have as crisp image as the original one but it was still decent). And then about 3 weeka later the phone went face down to my bedroom floor from my night table and the screen became completely unusable. And that's the flaw. This screen is not resistant to any minor stress, it will just crack very easily. Worse part is i looked in a bunch of different sites and there are simply no screen protectors nor sturdy covers for this model in particular which means of you do buy this phone you HAVE to bay the extra protection plan or else just be ready to throw more money at it or replace it.... which is a shame because it's a nice phone.",
