                "reviewText": "We needed a basic Smartphone for an older relative who had a flip phone, but now lives with us (so we can help her with her phone). This went on-sale. It's great for her needs. The cameras do not work well at all in low light (in fact they need a lot of light). Photos come out grainy in less than bright light. But she's not going to be doing much of that. Works great for calls, and for playing video- even though it's not stereo (but with headphones it is, and smartphone speakers are not aurally stereo- they're too close together to get a good stereo image).The screen is plenty good for most anyone's purposes. Battery life also seems good (in the few days we've had this). I just wish it had wireless charging. But it does have NFC, and can screen-cast- which is great for her, though she needs help to do it.The USB interface is as fast as the one on my Note 10 (using a 10Gbps cable), which isn't to say it's that fast. And it charges rapidly.It's water-resistant enough for snorkeling, so that won't be an issue- though I don't think she got her old phone wet, ever. It's plenty loud enough for her needs. I have already sat on it (on the seat of her wheeled walker) for about 10 minutes, and that didn't pose any problem at all. I showed her that the screen is scratch-proof (by scraping it with a knife and an ice pick). So it will hold up in her purse just fine.Once she got the hang of answering it, it's been great so far. She's on Consumer Cellular, so the junk/spam/scam calls are rolling in and she gets lot s of practice.",

                "reviewText": "My 5-year-old trusty LG G6 was finally getting to the point where I had to charge it several times a day, so I started phone shopping. Not gonna pay $800+ for a giant phone with way more features than I need, and not gonna go with an inexpensive, off-brand phone either. Found the A23 and the reviews looked promising, especially when it was on sale.Setting up the phone and getting the apps copied over was easy - I assume I got lucky sticking my SIM card in the correct slot. Had to re-do a few log-ins as I could not copy some accounts over from the old phone. Fingerprint reader works well enough, although it was tedious to get my finger scanned all the way.It has taken me a while to get used to the newer version of Android, and a few things are annoyingly over-complicated, compared to the old phone, but I'll get used to it. Performance and call quality are good, and the 5G screams. I typically get home from work with at least 75% battery left -- which is much better than the LG phone, even when it was new.Sadly, the camera resolution is poor - digital zoom gets grainy pretty fast, and zooming / cropping a 1x photo shows this as well. However, the macro and portrait features are nice, and do take good photos. The flash feature is kinda weird -- even if you turn it off, it may still come on if the overall picture area is dark.Overall, I'd say this is a good phone for kids / seniors / frugal folks -- good performance, battery life, speaker volume, and screen brightness. I wish it was a tad smaller -- but unless I want to go to the dark side (smaller iPhone), I'll have to get used to it.",

                "reviewText": "I would recommend the Samsung A23 5G to anyone! The reception is great, the opening of sites and uploads is quick, it takes great pictures and the battery life lasts for over three days. My old Motorola only lasted half a day, so this is amazing! The only thing I'm not crazy about is having to enter a pin number or a fingerprint to open the phone to use it. I know it's for security, but I didn't have that on my old phone, so this is new to me.",

Stock Android would have been a much better UI.Also the cameras were not working out-of-the-box, i had to download some Samsung updates before i could take any pictures. The cameras work now but the quality is really bad. My $100 phone from 10 years ago takes better photos! And is the same number of megapixels. I expected the camera to be bad just not THIS bad.I'm sitting here wondering how the heck Samsung is so popular. This is the worst phone I've ever owned.Payed for the brand name. Fooled me once...",
