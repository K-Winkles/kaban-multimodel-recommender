                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars As promised",
                "reviewText": "The one I purchased is the unlocked international version A53 5G model (SM-A536E-DS). This is to replace my A51 of the same model line. I am with US T-Mobile and use a GSM-based network in the country I plan to use the 2nd SIM. So, my following comments are for T-Mobile and cannot speak for other network. Samsung made this clear that it will only work for GSM based network, not for CDMA (i.e., Verizon) based network. You need to verify this. It is, however, a bit confusing, that the vendor included a note in the package stating the above fact (see picture). But it included \"AT&T\" on the list (see markup in the photo). As far as I know, AT&T is the same as T-Mobile, both are GSM based network. So, I think, it meant to say \"Verizon\". Bad for the vendor, who don't seem to even know what they are selling!!I bought it primarily for the Dual Sim Dual Standby capability, in addition to other good things provided by the A-xx model line by Samsung, such as a larger battery, decent screen size and brightness/resolution, and a Samsung-promised 4 year OS upgrade. For $320, you cannot beat the offer with a Samsung's brand supports. To begin the use, I used Samsung Smart Switch App in transferring my A51 to the new A53. It did a very decent job on transferring App, photos, data files, messages, as well as other key phone settings. But you will have to reset each notification sound as it is different (if your previous selection is not available for the new phone). Also it took quite a while (over 40 minutes in the first stage) to download all the data via a WIFI network (mine has a download speed rated at 350 MB). If you have a slow wifi it will take even longer I assume. I suggest you leave the screen on at all time during the transfer so that you can react to the prompts from time to time to complete the switch, Because some of the Apps involve password approval or 2nd authentication, it is not possible to just leave it to the program to do the job. Overall, it took almost an hour to get everything done. Even so, some of the App-based data files and cloud-based info download took more time to download (depending on file server of that App). So, you will need to be a bit patient. But overall it did a good job. The international version promise DSDS, but that means you will not be able to install the microSD card (it has only two slots either for two SIMs, or one SIM and one microSD). This is unfortunately a downgrade from A51 because A51 actually has three slots in the SIM cassette, two for SIMs and one for microSD!! After the switch I already used up about 50% of the internal 128GB memory as pictures from the old phone are all transferred to the new phone. If you take 4K video a lot, then you need to consider the fact of using the DSDS without the microSD (the spec says A53 can take a 1TB microSD card). I see quite a few comments about not able to make calls or having trouble with the old SIM (as the phone is not unlocked??). I have no such issues at all for both A51 and A53. Both are true plug-and-play without a hitch, no need for a new SIM. Remember to reset the sound profile - otherwise it is confusing as you can have trouble making quick response to various notification sounds. I did a bit of photographing around the house. A53 has a better chipset than A51 and it is very fast by my A51 standard for taking still photos and A53 fit my needs for taking indoor photo or mixed lighting conditions without any issues. The newer AI camera is very capable in deciding the exposure for taking the best picture under mixed light exposure. I am happy.So, in the first 24 hours, everything works as promised. Last notes: it came in Spanish (probably manufactured primarily for Latin America??) so you will need to make switch to your preferred language the first thing you do. A nice surprise it that within 2 hours after finishing the \"switch\", it asks me to upgrade from Android 12 to Android 13 with the new security patch of 1/1/2023. BTW, my A51 came in with Android 10 and is has since been successfully upgraded to Android 13. I am so delighted that Samsung kept this promise on OS upgrade and security patch. I therefore expect the continuing use of both phones without worrying about the OS obsolete!! Thumbs up for Samsung.I will try giving an update after I return from the trip to tell you how the DSDS works on this model. But with the experience from A51 DSDS, I do not see it is a problem,",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this phone for use with Consumer Cellular service. It works fine except the signal strength isn't as good as my husband's A13 model. I found out that to use the dual sim card feature you have to pay for 2 lines. Duh! I should've figured that out myself! You can achieve this in other ways without the second line and the second sim card but I have yet to try it. Great camera! Pretty easy to use overall, for a smart phone. I replaced a Samsung phone with this one so there wasn't much of a learning curve. Overall a good deal and transaction.",

                "reviewText": "He sold me a defective phone that didn't work. I bought 3 different Sim cards 2 phone cases . Two different phone IT technicians from Verizon and AT&T tried to make the phone work with the Sim cards but it wouldn't and now he's saying I returned it back damaged which isn't true. I never got to even use the phone. I mailed back in the original box by UPS just as I received with 2 labels as requested. Then he said he didn't have the pin, I gave him that. He never said anything about the phone being damaged then because it wasn't. He only refunded me $42.90 on a $389.00 phone . He said he kept the rest for a restocking fee which isn't my responsibility and when I confronted him now he's trying to say I sent back dated which is false. I couldn't even open the jpg pics he sent me. If the pics is damaged it's not the one I purchased and returned just as I received. I do have a Supervisor named Bosh helping me to try and get my full refund, but this seller is being dishonest. I've been a long time customer with Amazon and never had the hassle I've experienced with Integron Technologies.",

                "reviewText": "Once I got the phone it was working good on AT&T but after about a month AT&T the phone stopped working due to model number is not on AT&T list of phones it supports in 5G upgrade which has been very painful to many of AT&T customers. This even after extensive tries by an AT&T retail store clerk whom tried very hard with phone center customer service.So with phone not working on AT&T I went to T-Moble and after a test with T-Mobile sim card I then changed carriers. The phone was working great until my old AT&T number was imported & even after many efforts by the T-Mobile store clerk to try to rectify a problem all incoming calls go direct to voice mail.I can make calls & use data OK but cannot receive. (Currently I have calls forwarding to another number)I went to U-Break I Fix store & the clerk there says I probably need to reset the phone to manufacturer settings & re-upload all phone updates to see if will work? Still have not done that yet do to it is time consuming.....",
