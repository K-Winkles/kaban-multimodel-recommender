I had to order multiple replacement SIMs from the new carrier until the phone completely fried its ability to read them. It scratched up the first two beyond readability and would not register the other two at all.Aside from that issue the phone worked just fine but it made itself useless as a lifeline, the intended purpose in which I bought it.",

After trying everything on their end (Mint), and the fact that the sim card was working fine with other phones, they told me the phone was locked. But it wasn't! I looked up the IMEI number on the phone and it said it was all free and clear, not locked and not black listed. In the end It took me trying 15 different APN variations for Mint mobile until one finally worked. It did not work right away either, so imagine my surprise when I came back to try yet another solution an hour later, and suddenly...everything was fine! Could make calls, send texts, and surf the internet with ease.As far as the phone goes, I will need to use it for a bit before knowing how good/bad the battery, functions, etc are. But so far, all is well, it is doing the job, and it is indeed unlocked.*** just FYI, instructions were only in Spanish and I had to change the language to American English since the default language for the phone is also in Spanish.",

Fast, decent storage and comfortable in the hand. Decent camera although even an 8mp camera will look great on any of the new screens,unless you want to print, which I don't do, otherwise a decent cameraUsing as a global phone here in Mexico on a TelCel SIM with no issues. Aftermarket cases are available and fit perfect and buttons all in the right places. Fast charging,but not wireless charging as far as I know. If you want an inexpensive phone, you can't do much better,IMHO.",

                "reviewText": "I have tried this phone on three different networks (mine, my sons and my husbands) IT WONT WORK! It won't make a call; I keep getting error messages saying that it isn't compatible with the network. I finally called two of those networks and they both said that the phone was NOT unlocked! I guess I spent nearly $100 on a nice paperweight. I'm extremely upset with this purchase. But then again, when I unboxed it everything was set up for China, the time zone and everything.",
