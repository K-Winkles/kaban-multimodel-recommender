The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is one of the best you can get around $200. It will update to Android 13. If this seller has more, I highly suggest you buy it.The only thing (and this is not the seller\u2019s or manufacturer\u2019s fault), is that the S20 FE is not compatible on Spectrum Mobile. Why? I have no idea when the S20, S21, S22, S23, A54, A71, A72\u2026.and more are compatible with Spectrum.So if you\u2019re looking to use it with Spectrum Mobile, save yourself, and the seller\u2019s time and a headache and go with the S20 or A71. Both have excellent specs for around $200 and Spectrum compatible.",
