                "reviewText": "I procure and customize Android devices, specifically Google, as a little side source of income for myself. Needless to say I am surrounded by a ton of phones and about 95% of them I do not like.I gravitate toward pure Google phones because one can tweak them and make them function and operate and perform to the specific individuals needs.I have had every Google phone from the original Pixel right through the 5. This review is about the 4a so I won't elaborate on why I dislike models past the 5. I will only say that they're just too darn BIG.I found this phone on Amazon being sold as \"used, like new\" from Amazon stock and I already knew that if it's coming directly from Amazon stock that it's not going to be some discarded vendor phone with a attachment of a service provider or bloatware, etc. (because Amazon is careful the screen what they sell from their own stock because they stand behind it 100% \ud83d\ude01).Even though I have a whole bunch of phones from which to choose, I use a Pixel 4a5g as my primary phone but it started to feel a little bit too large for me and holding it just hurt my hand for lack of better description. I don't like large phones. I always keep two primary phones and my secondary phone, that I had for almost 6 years, finally gave up so I was in the market to replace it.I wanted something smaller than the 4a5g, which I do continue to use. Google's phones just keep getting bigger so I sought out what might still be available with Android updates, has a decent battery life, and is small and appealing and I found the 4a. I ADORE IT!I could probably write a book about all the reasons that you should buy this phone but it would take a zillion years to do so and certainly blow up Amazon's servers SO I will synopsize.\u2713 It is a nice, pleasant to hold size and is very suitable and comfortable to hold for extended periods of time while texting or viewing websites or videos;\u2713 right out of the box you will be able to update to Android 13 and receive updates, I believe for the next 3 years;\u2713 it does not come with a bunch of bloatware which people usually try to get rid of by rooting their phones and therefore destroying warranty and usually screwing up their phones. Right out of the box you can customize it to perform to your personal satisfaction;\u2713 battery life is absolutely fantastic! On paper the battery doesn't look like it would be so great but, au contraire, I've been texting and looking at YouTube videos and shopping online since 8:30 this morning (it's 3:19 right now so that's almost 8 hours) and my battery is still at 86% \ud83d\ude2e! EXCELLENT!;\u2713 it does not come with wireless charging built in but you can purchase a wireless adapter (get \"short\" if you don't want the finger print unlock covered up) for about $15 and the charging world is beautiful;\u2713 unlike most of the newer phones, this one came with the charger, c cord, as well as the adapter so you can zap the contents of your existing phone right smack over to your new 4a before you get done deciding on what to make for dinner;\u2713 phone is very responsive and does not start lagging even with multiple websites, facebook, and Amazon shopping open and active;\u2713 screen resolution is exceptional and does NOT force dark mode as many of the current models do;\u2713 easily accessible full developer mode allows you to tweak the settings so that the phone performs and looks the way YOU want it to;\u2713 has fingerprint unlock as well as custom bezel configuration;\u2713 cutout can be easily hidden for those that find it annoying as I do (on other brands of phones you're stuck with the thing \ud83d\ude21);\u2713 camera quality is absolutely excellent for both stills and videos as well as wide and landscape modes. For those desiring a camera camera camera type of mode, I usually install \"open camera\" for my clients. It allows you to tweak the heck out of everything and make the phone perform as a camera... There is absolutely no need to spend ridiculous amounts of money to get one of those phones that boasts about their camera... just install that app and I can't imagine anything else you could possibly need;I quite literally could go on for pages about what I love about this phone but it would take forever. I cannot find any flaws about it at all. I'm absolutely thrilled to have a phone that is a comfortable size and performs as I want it to.The only drawback that might even be something to be thought of is if you keep your phone for 10 or 12 years is that you are capped at 4G. BUT if you live in the United States that shouldn't be an issue at all for the next decade. I told you that my phone of 7 years finally died. It was working beautifully at 3G. It just got worn out. I do know a bit about customizing and programming phones and that might be why my lasted so long but with a little bit of care yours should be able to last just as long and don't be scared off by the 4G. It will last WELL into the future.I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase! If you are in the market for an unlocked fully customizable phone, and you want one that isn't as big as a freaking cereal box sitting in front of you, this is the way to go!",

                "reviewText": "I had the Pixel 4a for a month in late 2020, and I generally liked the phone. The most important part that makes this phone great is the price, $350. It's not going to get you any top-tier iPhone 12 Pro Max or Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, but it gives you everything the general user would possibly need - a decently fast Snapdragon 730G SOC, 6GB RAM, and 128GB storage. That's something that not even the $830 base configuration of iPhone 12 gets you.Of course, being $350 there are a few things that it misses out on compared to higher-tier phones. One of those things would be the plastic unibody build over something like a metal and glass sandwich. On a phone of this price point it's fine, though I did have a bit of plastic creaking near the SIM slot. It was just an annoyance at worst, because the rest of the plastic build felt fine.Wireless charging is also not present, this may disappoint some that used it but it didn't bother me cause I never used wireless charging on my iPhone 8.There's no water resistance either, which did raise my eyebrows a bit before I bought the phone but I don't submerge my phone in water or take it to very dusty places.One thing this does have that the $700 Pixel 5 doesn't have is a headphone jack. So if you still use anything with a 3.5mm plug, this phone has you covered with no need for adapters! The speakers are also quite good, with one speaker on the bottom next to the USB-C port and one built into the earpiece.As for the software, it's got three years of updates which is better than many Android manufactures, but it still won't top Apple's software support. I did notice a few software bugs when I used it, mainly with YouTube Vanced's PIP mode after a certain amount of time. Restarting fixed the issue but it was an annoyance. Hopefully that was just Android 11 and that gets fixed with a future update.Battery life is also pretty decent, better than the aging battery on my iPhone 8 since I could comfortably leave it off the charger for one night. Given that it's a small phone by today's standards it's not going to be a battery life king, but it's better than the $400 iPhone SE.The size is something I loved about this phone, my hands are relatively small and I like my phone to be pocketable, which is something that I'm not a fan of with most new phones being over 6 inches in size. The 5.81-inch edge-to-edge screen Is of a similar size to my iPhone 8 and the iPhone X, thus I could easily use it with one hand and it fit well in my pockets. This is something I'm sure is greatly appreciated by those who also like smaller phones.The camera has been the definition of the Pixel phones since the first ones launched in 2016. This phone has an amazing single 12MP lens, mostly made great by Google's computational photography software. Night mode was very nice to use, as in the scenarios I used it in it helped out take better photos at night. I'm no expert with cameras so I don't know much about white balance, dynamic range, etc. I do like how this phone gives you one great camera as opposed to other manufacturers which give you like seven different pretty-much-useless camera sensors.Overall, this is the phone to buy if you're on a budget of less than $500 and you want something that will fulfill all the general needs. I would suggest going for the Pixel 4a 5G version if you can afford a $500 phone as that has a second ultrawide camera lens, a faster Snapdragon 765G SOC, and as the name says, 5G connectivity. That phone will overall will give you a very very close experience to the Pixel 5, but if you don't have that much to put down for a phone, and if you like the standard 4a's smaller size, this phone is the way to go. I highly recommend it and I would personally pick this any day of the week over a similarly priced phone from a China brand like Oppo, Xiaomi, ZTE, Vivo, etc.",

So easy to transfer my stuff over to pixel because I'm a Google person.The battery life is ok. It doesn't last 24hr unless you use your phone all the time. It'll drain very quick if you're on it too long but charging it is very easy and quick. It can be back to 100% in a hour of charging.",

He probado m\u00e1s de 5 m\u00f3viles, entre los que estaban un iPhone un oppo y un vivo x60 pro. Compralo pero sabr\u00e1s que lo vas a devolver porque tanto la app de la c\u00e1mara como sus opciones, son rid\u00edculas para este siglo",
