                "reviewText": "Great phone with some flaws. But first things first...this is a well designed, very functional, high performance phone. The cameras are possibly the best you'll get on a phone for now. Better than those on the Iphone 13(which maybe deals with low light situations better). The wide angle options both for stills (see night mode pics \"regular'and wide angle) videos are especially great. Zoom is well executed and integrated, although I've never used the 100x. Overall pic. quality is absolutely top notch(for a phone in 2022). The stylus feels smoother than previous versions, and the matt surface helps with grip. The existence of a stylus alone puts this phone in a league of its own. Charging is quick, especially for such a 'heavy duty' phone.The large size of the screen is really a plus if you're multitasking and have several screens open. It's easier to toggle between screens. There's several minor improvements that add up to a much better user experience. The screen that pops up when the Spen is pulled out for e.g.Things not to love: The absence of a microSD slot still bugs me. The phone is heavy. Not a fan of the speakers. The price(although I got it at a discount to the launch price).Overall, the phone is very definitely worth the large investment its purchase entails. In the functionality vs portability vs price tradeoff the S22 Ultra more than any other phone hits a sweet spot.",

Still a bit of a dissapointment from the best that samsung offers.If you're 2 gens behind at least, then I can recommend the upgrade. Other than that probs wait for next ultra.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Great first impressions! Not on the battery life though...",
                "reviewText": "Initial impressions/rant +Tldr tier rating at the end.After using this phone for a week I love it! I got this phone on prime day with 128gb storage and 8gb ram for only $850 bucks!!! I've upgraded to this phone from a A52 4g ($400 dollar 2021 Samsung midrange phone) so thats the reference phone. Here is a list of pros and cons, im going to start with the pros:-This camera is soo good, video is good (not as good as on the iPhone 13 series but definitely more than usable). I really do like the 3x, and 10x optical zoom and although the 100x space zoom is kind of a gimmick its still very cool and pictures are usable in 30x zoom! Macro mode is cool and front camera is also really good.-The screen is nice and bright, it's big and sharp and although some people don't really like curved screens I don't really mind it that much. Also the Adaptable 1hz-120hz is a game changer and depending on your usage it can actually help you save battery life!-The S-Pen functionality is great, it sits on the bottom left of the phone. It now has a nice matte finish which makes it move less in your hands and allows you to be more precise. But its not as colorful as before. The way the S-Pen feels and functions makes me want to use it more for things like photos, videos, screenshots, and writing since the latency is 2.8 milliseconds which is barley noticeable and if you don't want to use it just put it away since it's part of the phone.-The charging is pretty fast (goes up to 45w) I use the 25w fast charger and can get this phone to 100% in around an hour. For wireless charging it charges at 15w max and for reverse wireless charging or powershare (surprised Apple hasn't introduced this feature yet) it charges other devices at 5w which may seem little but the way I think it's intended to be used or the way I use it is to charge accessories like my watch and buds to last me the day.-The speakers are good and loud. It's a dual speaker set-up with the top one being the earpiece and other one being on the bottom left of the phone. The only thing I dont like about them is the placement of the bottom speaker because when you turn your phone over to the left (most people do and it's so the camera is on the top left of the phone in landscape rather than the bottom right) your right hand either cups or covers the bottom facing speaker. Another pro is that both speakers have those little white foam ball's in them which makes them sound louder without losing detail which is good.-The build quality on this phone is A+ it feels so nice in the hands and the curves make it pretty good to hold. The corners are sharp but a case should do just fine. And the back glass is so nice and it feels great, it also doesn't leave fingerprints!-The Design is subjective so this is all my opinion and I would say that I like it. Although the no camera bump is wierd since I'm used to the camera bumps and I really liked the one on the S21 Ultra this is better because it's just one thing less sticking out the back of the phone. It also makes the slim cases for this phone even slimmer since they don't have to compensate for the camera bump. One think to note is that since now it's just separate cameras sticking out there is less protection because there is no more metal housing around them and the camera gets pretty dusty around the lenses so you just have to pay a bit more attention but still imo a better design.-The color is again Subjective and I got it in green and im going to tell you guys, this is the color to get if you don't want Burgundy. I think this color is better but the top 2 most popular colors is this one and that one. Another thing is that while you can see the pictures of this phone which I've taken on the A52 4g the picture doesn't do it justice, this green is epic! It's like the green that the iPhone 13 series has but to me it looks like a aquamarine color (blue green) with a little more green into it so in some lightning it can look a bit blue but it would mostly look more green. Great color though!Now here we go to the downsides which is only one: The battery life (Sorry for the rant in advance)-The only downside in my opinion to this phone is the battery life, this phone with a 5,000mlh battery allows me to only get about 4 to 5 hrs of SOT out of the box??? Come on Samsung, for $1,199 this battery is unacceptable. The iPhone 13 pro max gets up to 9 hours of SOT for $100 less and with a faster processor. I really hope that a future update comes that drastically fixes the battery because this is not it. I did watch a few dozen videos that give tips on what settings to turn on/off to give me the best battery life without losing things like a QHD+ 120hz screen or turning on battery saver because I paid for it so I should be able to experience this phone at its fullest potential and I've been able to get this phone up to a solid 7 hours of SOT which is definitely an improvement but Samsung we shouldn't need to be doing this for $1,199. I gave it 4 stars instead of 3 because otherwise this phone is Awesome and I was able to increase the battery life about 2 to 3 hours more without sacrificing things like screen resolution and refresh rate or processor speed.I do plan of keeping this phone because other than the battery, it's great in every other category. I also got it for a steal and with how good Samsungs trade in credit is I'm going to take good care of it until the S23 ultra comes out (Hopefully with a battery improvement) and ill trade in this phone to get that one for about $200 bucks. I love Samsung and am in the Samsung ecosystem pretty deep (galaxy watch 4 44mm in green and galaxy buds2 pro in black) but there are just some things that I can't tolerate but hopefully they see what the problem is (most likely is some software problem) and they fix it by giving this phone a software update or make a hardware change on the next phone that comes out. I do appreciate the 4 years of OS updates I really do but there is no way I can use a phone for 4 years that has a mediocre battery experience. But so far this phone is great in every other way and I'll update when things change and if the battery life gets better. But so far it's a easy 8/10 for me, good work Samsung!Tldr: Phone rating: (Compared to iPhone and other Andrioid flagship phones + my subjective opinion)-Camera: A+ Tier-Screen: S Tier-S-Pen: A+ Tier (compared to the ones before on the Note series)-Charging: A Tier-Speakers: A+ Tier-Build Quality: S Tier-Design: A+ (Subjective)-Color: A+ (Subjective)-Battery: B- (Goes to B+ if you optimize the phone enough)",
