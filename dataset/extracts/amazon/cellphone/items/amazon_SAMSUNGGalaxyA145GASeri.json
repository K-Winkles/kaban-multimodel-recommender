The inclusion of 5G connectivity is a notable plus, ensuring faster data speeds and improved network performance. The device's display is vibrant and provides a satisfying viewing experience for multimedia content. The camera system, though not flagship-level, captures decent photos for everyday use. The battery life is commendable, providing all-day usage on a single charge. The overall design is sleek and modern, giving the phone a premium feel. However, the processing power may not match higher-end models, and demanding applications may experience some lag. For those on a budget seeking a reliable 5G smartphone with essential features, the Samsung Galaxy A14 5G is a worthy consideration.",

                "reviewText": "So far I really like this phone. I needed a new phone and didn't want to spend a lot and didn't want to have to learn how to use a different kind of phone. I've had galaxy phones and so I wanted to stick with that. This was the best priced phone that was 5G and had at least the same features as my old phone. While this is a 2023 and my old phone was 2019 there isn't a lot of new features. I'd say mostly there are upgrades in screen quality, camera quality, storage capacity, network, and some minor added features like it can link to your smart devices with an app, but I use Alexa on my fire tablet for that. I'm sure there's other new things I just haven't found yet but I don't do to much on my phone besides calls, texts, and emails, so I'm good; no need for a $500+ phone for me.",

                "reviewText": "Galaxy 14 5g I've only had a few weeks so may need to edit later but so happy w this phone! It was listed as #2 for best camera in a consumer report and I sell mobile homes so camera was top priority. No comparison from my old moto g7 play!! What an uprade and a fraction of the cost of the i phones ( which was #1 for photo) plus I believe its new not refurb. Super user friendly editing features. Rarely have to use my professional photo editor and better adjusting for various lighting. As far as other features seamless transition from my last Android. Not tecky but was able to figure out most everything on my own. Simple interface without clutter. Very well organized basic apps. No obnoxious intrusive Google apps. Easy to turn off those. Came with a cord but no box to plug into wall but that was no problem because had cords from last Droid. (C) Was a little finicky with which cords it would charge with ( the low quality ones didn't charge so tossed them) Unlocked. I switched to at & t. They were able to transfer # and contacts. If I was looking for something to complain about. The touch screen seems inconsistent in some apps ( varying sensitivity) but it's probably an adjustable setting. This is the first time I can honestly say I like the new phone better than the old I was forced to upgrade for a great price on prepaid plan. Thank you!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this new 5G Samsung phone as a replacement for my outdated 4G Samsung. The new phone is slightly larger and heavier, but I do like the bigger display which features sharp resolution and vivid colors. I bought an unlocked phone and transferred my Mint Mobile sim card. Everything worked perfectly. If you use your phone for high-end photography, playing games, or watching TV, maybe the more expensive phones are worth it. However, if you talk, text, use the web, and access apps like Google Maps, Facebook, Twitter, etc., then this phone will do nicely. As others have pointed out, a USB-C cable comes with the phone but no charger. I chatted with Samsung support, which recommended the 15W charger. I bought it on Amazon for under $16.00: Samsung 15W Wall Charger Type C (USB-C Cable Included), Black. You could get just the charger for 88 cents less, but I thought having a second USB-C cable was worth it.",

                "reviewText": "My first smartphone was a Samsung Galaxy and it was great! So I was really excited to see this one listed at such a good price. BUT I hate this phone! If I could, I would return it immediately! I have been trying to get used to it, but it is just awful! Unfortunately, my old phone just died so I had to order one quick. This had pretty good reviews and a great price (I refuse to pay many hundreds or thousands of dollars for a phone) but have regretted it since. The battery literally takes overnight to charge from even just 40-50%, the voice text is gawd awful and doesn't understand anything I say, skips punctuation and will just stop in the middle of a sentence. I can hardly send pictures or any other attachments in the text area. But it will randomly attach pictures to messages I am trying to post on a work chat board (luckily most of my pictures are just cats and other cute animals I meet) so that's fun-sarcasm. If you are thinking about buying this phone, my advice is to just keep on scrolling and find something else.Addendum: here's a prime example of why I hate this phone. When I went to bed last night, the battery was at 32%. It's 8 hours later and it's only at a 74% charge. THIS PHONE SUCKS!!",
