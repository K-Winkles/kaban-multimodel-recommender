However the operation storage for this phone is minimal! I am only able to download and use 2 additional apps (not factory apps). Sometimes I can only use one additional app.However regardless of that, I have to clean storage and delete things multiple times a day. Or else the phone won't operate properly. Now I will say maybe that is due to the fact that this phone is a 2021 phone and we are now in the year 2023 so data is more than it was back then as it continues to get more as the years progress. Even with an SD card installed the phone itself has limited operational memory it can use I have disabled apps and uninstalled updates on apps just to be able to keep using this phone.",
