                "reviewText": "I was looking for a new smartphone to replace my nearly 6 year old Samsung S7, and was shopping for a compact size device under 6\" x 2-3/4\". Choices are few in this small size, and after considerable research and reading many favorable reviews on the Asus Zenfone 10, I ordered one. While I've had it for only a week, I'm very pleased with this phone so far. Upon receipt, I was able to connect it to my old phone via cable and transfer all my data files (documents and photos) and most of my apps in about 10 minutes. This transfer did not require installing any utility in either phone -- the Zenfone's \"Phone Clone\" utility did it all seamlessly. The few apps that were not transferred were easily enough downloaded from Google Play. Android 13 has changed several feature and navigation aspects so there's a bit of a learning curve for that. This Zenfone is a solid feeling phone and is quite easy to hold with its slightly thicker profile than the S7. The included hard shell case that helps protect the camera lenses is nice, but I've ordered a black rubber case for it as I prefer a non-slip feel. This phone accommodates two SIM cards and is one of the few phones available that still has a headphone jack. I haven't yet taken photos but the Zenfone's specs should make them outstanding. Battery life seems really good so far in standby mode, and the display definition and brilliance is exception. Based on my experience to date, I recommend this phone to anyone who is similarly looking for a compact smartphone.I received the kwmobile soft case for the Zenfone 10, and it's an improvement over the case included with the phone, in that it's flexible and has better non-slip feel to it. It fits nicely and doesn't add appreciably to the Zenfone's dimensions.I tried using the Zenfone's fingerprint security feature, but it's a bit difficult to get a fingerprint registered, and I'm concerned about the ease of subsequent fingerprint recognition -- certainly don't want to get locked out. I might try again. Still impressed with the quality and operation of this Zenfone.",

                "reviewText": "Bought October of 2023, the phone was never dropped, not cracked nor damage, never submerged in water nor wet, never overcharged nor left charging overnight (always set to charging limit of 80 or 90% and only charged while I'm awake). Phone just died out of no where and can't be charged nor turned on no matter what. Paid $800 for a phone for it not to work after a measly 3 months, and don't know if I can even get a warranty exchange or return for it.",

                "reviewText": "Two phones ago, in '17, I was happily enjoying the added features of usb-3 like fast transfers, the ability to use an HDMI dongle to connect displays or the corded usbc headphones that became available when most phones removed the headphone jack.None of that will work on a zonphone-10 because Asus decided the now obsolete legacy usb-2 protocol is all you deserve.But that would is not all. They hid it from you by running the version 2 protocol over the modern usb-c physical port, and they didn't disclose it.It looks like a modern phone. It has a modern chipset, the specs, the usb-c port that most people assume is synonymous with usb-3 support since that is part of what it was designed for and they became standard on devices around the same time.The short version is that the protocol problem has is bad. That drops them to maybe 2 or 3 stars. The drop form that to one star is due to my perception that Asus hid the embarrassment instead of disclosing what I they are offering in full.I've purchased 8 devices from Asus over many years, but they lost me as a customer with this trick.",
