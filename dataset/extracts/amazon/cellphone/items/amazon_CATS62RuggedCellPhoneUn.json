                "reviewText": "My daily driver is an iPhone, however, I like both Androids and iPhones. I saw this on my recommendations and was surprised by how value priced the phone was and that it was made by CAT. I thought to myself....\"like the construction vehicles??\" and sure enough yep just like I thought. I decided to give it a try and just like the title says I was surprised by this one.I don't have T-Mobile currently so I couldn't test out the cellular antenna but I have been using it on WiFi and it's done wonderfully. Set your expectations correctly and I think you'll find this phone works well.I also have a Samsung Z Flip and an S22 so I came into this knowing that this CAT phone probably won't be up there with the flagship Android phones and I was fine with that. I wanted an Android phone that I didn't have to worry about being mishandled here and there but also performed well enough with the usual apps like email, camera, photos, web browsing, messaging, etc. I knew this wouldn't be a gaming phone or anything of the sort but a few games here and there would be fine.Happy to report the phone lived up to my expectations while being super sturdy feeling and durable. I'm not sure about the IP ratings because I don't want to test those (and hopefully I won't have to) so I can't comment on that part of this phone. I'm pleased with the color/clarity/brightness of the screen and how responsive it is, the camera takes nicely detailed photos, and the fingerprint reader works well and recognizes my fingerprint fast every time.I wanted to see what the battery life of this phone would be on standby (on but not using it) and it's nuts. I checked it yesterday and it was at 16% battery left...after being on for 16 days! Clearly this depends on many different variables like signal strength, background apps, etc but needless to say I was super impressed.Overall happy with this phone and would buy again if I needed a rugged mid-range phone that I didn't have to worry about being mishandled here and there. It's quite a weighty phone so keep that in mind.",

                "reviewText": "Outer appearance: the outer shell of the phone is kind of thick. It's not so thick that it's bulky, but rather rugged as stated in its name. It's not heavy, but it is most definitely heavy duty. This isn't only for rugged work environments, it's also perfect as a starter phone for a rambunctious child. My toddler loves my phone, but also likes to throw it when he gets upset. Because of this, he has broken two already. This one stands up to him and doesn't back down.Speed/responsiveness: the screen is easy to touch, meaning you don't have to hard press it to work. It doesn't lag. The response time is rather speedy actually.App availability: all apps that are available for Android is available on this phone.Size: it's perfect for video watching due to the large display, but also small enough to store in most places designed for phones.Camera: although the screen is vibrant and bright, the camera quality is just okay. It's not an outstanding camera, but it's not annoyingly bad either. It's no Samsung Galaxy camera. Side to side, my galaxy has better low-light, outdoors, and indoor picture and video quality.Storage: the amount of storage space is phenomenal. You can download several apps and still take several pictures like my toddler often does with my phone.It excels in the rugged department and even quality. I would choose it for a long lasting budget phone anyday.",

                "reviewText": "After cracking my Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra screen on a Mountain Bike ride (i also do hike and some climbing) i realized i didn't want to bring a $1200+ to the bike trails anymore.For $130-ish i had very low expectations across the board, especially when you include the process of making the phone rugged to the cost, i was expecting a low resolution, low color saturation, low contrast display, a crawling slow phone with an extremely old Android version, an absolutely horrid camera and slow network. But very, very happily none of what i just mentioned is true, sure it's no flagship and Android 11 is 3 years old, but to be honest other than the slight, occasional system lag, this made me figure that diminishing returns are real when it comes to technology. It is a surprisingly very usable phone.I installed everything i need when i'm out riding, Whatsapp, the eventual Instagram peek, Strava to track my riding speed and trajectory, i still get my GMail, YouTube Music, and everything works great.I have to say that the phone looks and feels like one of those things that you see in an industrial setting that would withstand drops and liquid dripping on it, sure it'll display chips and damage if you drop it bare, even cracks, but it'll probably still work, it looks very, very durable.The battery life lasted the whole day and had battery left for the next day, the speakerphone rings loudly, the GPS is precise and while it's not exactly Bluetooth 5.3 its definitely 5.0 which was one of the latest big jumps, it is 4G LTE and not 5G but honestly other than more bandwidth, latency is very decent, and it'll stream pretty much anything without a buffer on the Metro (now owned by T-Mobile) network, so i assume it's unlocked as advertised.Comes with Android 10, but a System Update (1.67GB) is Available to Android 11 on Preferences -> About Phone.The camera was a big surprise (see sample pictures of plastic plant and bread) i think some of it is AI post processing because the camera itself doesn't look as good on the preview, but whatever it is, it is doing an outstanding job, look at those pics! On a rugged phone for $130!Overall i am super happy with it, i feel much more at peace when crossing a rocky river on an outdoor day with this than with my $1200 smartphone, would definitely withstand rough work conditions in construction or an industrial setting, which is its main purpose based on the CAT lineup of apps, but still will perform well in any environment.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Wow, I did not expect a rugged industrial smart phone less than $200 has so many features, I am impressed! I am new to Android phone, I have been using iPhone since 2014, so a lot of my comparisons are based on Cat S62 vs iPhone 15. First impression is, this is a robust thick aluminium 5.7\u201d frame rated for construction drop resistance. It is also waterproof and dust proof, with a 11 hours talk time interchangeable battery. It has most of the usual smart phone apps plus a \u201cToolbox\u201d with a host of \u201cCat\u201d apps for construction you can subscribe to. The display screen is high resolution with snappy touch response. Setup is very simple, just follow the on-screen instructions. However, once I reached transfer of my contacts from my iPhone to S62, I have to switch to Chrome browser and it was constantly interrupted by ads for purchase and contacts transfer process stopped. Eventually I successfully transferred all my contacts through iCloud share which took over 30 minutes. There are 4 buttons on the phone for on/off volume control and a orange tinted programmable button which I programmed to camera mode. The sim card slot is located above the programmable button with water proof gasket. Please watch my sim card installation video. The mono speaker has good quality and loud sound for outdoor environment. There is a finger print sensor on the back to quickly unlocking the phone, it works even when my index finger is wet. The S62 comes with 128 GB storage and 4 GB Ram. It is compatible with an external 256 GB USB C flash drive to expand the storage capacity. Drive management can be accessed by swiping down on the top menu to transfer files and images to the external drive. There is a 12 MP rear camera, not 48 MP as advertised, and a 8 MP front camera with 4 modes settings: video, photo, portrait and beauty. Additional settings are available by clicking on the 3 dots in camera mode: slo-mo, panorama, GIF, time-lapse, beauty video, manual and QR code. Tip: make sure you remove the clear plastic tape over the camera lenses before you start taking photos or videos, otherwise all your images will have a hazy glow effect on them. There are no zoom or wide angle lenses to choose from, just the standard rear and front camera lens and a depth sensor lens for focus. Generally, the photos and videos are well exposed with sharp focus in outdoor settings. Indoor setting however is not as good, images are grainy and not in focus 50% of the time. The display during image capture (for indoor or outdoor) is often quite dark, but the captured images or video is good but slightly under exposed in shadow areas, no HDR (high dynamic range) either, shadow are sometimes completely black. Overall, this Cat S62 smart phone is a bang for your buck, with rugged environmental and drop protection, good battery life, finger print to unlock, decent camera and audio functions, and all the usual smart phone features to choose from, I highly recommend this phone if you are looking for a budget smart phone.",

                "reviewText": "I was not aware that Caterpillar has phone manufacturing (I guess it\u2019s white labeled though) so when I saw it I had to try it out. Primary purpose is to be a backup / spare phone but also when I do some more demanding home projects where I might damage my primary phone.It\u2019s very impressive to see a 120$ phone packaging experience almost like premium phones.As you\u2019d expect from a rugged phone, it\u2019s fairly heavy and feels robust and indestructible (but just to be clear, I didn\u2019t try anything aggressive/invasive during my testing). Specs say it can be dropped from 6 ft on a steel surface with no damage (drop-proof).Body:* Body is aluminum / metal made and really feels like holding a weapon in a hand :-)* Buttons are also metal and I\u2019m impressed how firm they feel but not hard to press themScreen:* With a 5.7\u201d display and resolution 1080 x 2160 (yup, 2K) this phone offers great screen real estate.* Interaction with display content is responsive but maybe not as smooth as you\u2019d see on premium phones which are always combo of display and CPU but it is better than in many cheap phones that I had a chance to put my hands on.* Sharpness is great, fonts are clear and readable, definitely above expectationsOS and software:* Phone is driven by Android v11 and I wasn\u2019t able to update it to the newer version so I\u2019m pretty sure this is top, no further upgrades possible (unless you want to tinker with custom ROM).* Latest security update dates to June 5th, 2022 and no further updates after that.* Phone has a predefined Cat toolbox with a bunch of worker specific app suggestions but I want to highlight that this is not bloatware (like with Samsung). These are just shortcuts, so when you click on any of them, it will lead you to Google Play in case you want to install it. I\u2019m very impressed and appreciate this approach as this doesn\u2019t pollute your phone memory with stuff you don\u2019t want.Hardware:* CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon 660, Octacore 2.2GHz* WiFi is version 5, works very well with 2.5 GHz and 5 GHz, also signal reception is solid* Vibration and haptic feedback are, as expected, slightly stronger than with regular phones. You can turn them on/off but not adjust strength level* Battery is 4000 mAh which should suffice but I feel that it drains a bit faster, however nothing concerning at this time. Also the battery does support fast charging but you won\u2019t be able to see it on screen, however if you go to battery menu, it will indicate \u201cCharging rapidly\u201d.* Storage is expandable via microSD card up to 256 gigs. Card try is my biggest complaint with this phone, it is aluminum but feels hard to pull out and cheap.* Sound/speaker quality lacks slightly but it\u2019s perfectly fine for what is intended for. I\u2019d prefer using it with headphones or bluetooth.Carriers* Although the phone is designated to T-Mobile networks, (it\u2019s unlocked, right) I\u2019ve tested it with Canadian Fido SIM card (my primary phone) and European A1 network. Worked like a charm.Conclusion:Who could ask for more from 120$ phone? This phone, despite a few minor shortcomings, offers way more than you\u2019d expect in this price range. As I always take into consideration value for money, with that ratio in mind this phone is clear 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "For the price, this is a great quality phone. It\u2019s an android with good amount of memory, and a very bright screen with good resolution. Side by side with my iPhone 15, the screen for this Rugged phone is brighter at max brightness than the iPhone.In the box they include a block and charging cable. They also included a sim tray pin which isn\u2019t needed. The sim tray is protected behind a plug on the side and the tray is also able to hold an SD card. The tray can be removed easily by hooking your fingernail underneath and pulling it out. The plug is necessary and they even remind you to put it back in place to keep the phone waterproof after installing the SIM card.I like the feel of this phone and I suppose \u2018rugged\u2019 is a good word for it. It feels durable and has some weight to it. The back bottom portion is textured and grippy. I really like the fingerprint reader and find it to work very well. It\u2019s much more convenient than using the PIN and a million times better than Face ID.The camera is okay - nothing brilliant but more than adequate. The sound from the speakers is fine but everything sounds quite good over Bluetooth earbuds. The call quality is also good on both ends of the call.A great feature is the orange action button on the side of the phone. It can be programmed for a variety of apps. It can be used in two ways: a double press or a long press. I\u2019ve set my double press up as the flashlight and the long press takes me to settings. It works flawlessly.Anyone in the market for a relatively inexpensive smart phone would be pleased with this one, I\u2019m sure. It really seems like it should cost more than it does.",
