I think it would of lasted at least a couple of years. I love the big screen, pic quality, pretty much everything about it. I guess if I had to complain it would be that the finger reader wasn't able to read my print a lot of the times .. eventually, second/ third try it's fine.",

I purchased this phone as it was listed as an unlocked phone. It was not. I have AT&T the phone that we received was for Verizon. Plus the phone had a bad scratch on the glass front. I was very disappointed. The phone is great the listing by Amazon was completely incorrect. I have had better success with eBay.",

Instead of wasting precious time with Amazon/Verizon customer service, I switched to Visible and got the phone up and running within 15 minutes after receiving the SIM card.",
