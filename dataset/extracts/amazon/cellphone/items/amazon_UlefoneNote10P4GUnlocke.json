                "reviewText": "Just received. Positively surprised the phone came inside soft rubber protective case and screen protector already applied. Factory or seller retained original factory screen cover with labels and features listed ready to peel off. No need to spend extra money. I've been worrying where to get these from. Phone came with North American charger, USB-C cable and USB to mini jack adapter included, . Better not to lose it, haha.Works perfectly fine on Cricket (data and voice) which is owned by AT&T. I even called customer service to inquiry about the phone, gave them the IMEI and they said \"The phone is compatible\" and registered to their network.In 3 hours it used 1% of battery in idle with WiFi on.The only issue I noticed it does not connect to hidden WiFi hotspots at some places and typing all the info given does not work. Probably it needs the hotspot visible for just one time. It could be hidden again and the phone should remember it. Not the first device I encountered this. Amcrest IP cameras had the same problem.Will update after some time, but at this moment would definitely recommend.UPDATE 08/12/2019After few days of use taking one star off for camera quality.Pros:+ Battery life great. All day with data on and lightweight use takes up to 15-20%. Wifi only uses even less battery than LTE data.+ Support most of USA LTE bands (the most I ever seen in budget Chinese brand)+ Pretty fast relative speed (no noticable lag except when launching/dismissing camera app especially from locked screen or unlocking with camera in foreground is slow)+ Free memory after loading bunch of apps is still around 2.0 GB and after deep cleaning from the OS is 2.6 GB.Cons:- Earpiece not loud enough. Wish that could be improved.- Can't connect to hidden WiFi hotspot.- Camera is mediocre. Takes nice pictures under ideal conditions (outside in day light, inside or evening you better don't move)- No zoom. Not even digital. Perhaps I am dumb and don't know how to engage it. At least sliding fingers across frame did not help.- No OIS (optical stabilization)- Captured movies are terrible. It can't retain focus. Loses focus every few seconds or won't get it at all. Technically you are able to lock the focus, but after camera had acquired good focus the circular marker disappears and you need to touch and hold it again, but it will get into focusing again screwing the previous.Except the camera all the functions run smoothly as for the phone. It's still good phone.",

There are many phones made by China meet my requirements. But after I bought and compared several phones, I think this one is the best. I tried to put one T-Mobile card and one Verizon card in it and it is working perfectly. It is only $200 but the all function performance are very good ( speaker, photo, Wi-Fi , display,audio and video , Android app , etc.). I have iPhone X and iPhone X Max also but now I use this phone for most of the time.And one more thing is important that the company technic support is very good. I had many questions to ask them and got feedback quickly. The people are nice and patient. Their technical knowledge is good to answer my questions.",

Press the send button and wait upto 60 seconds before call begins. Of course, no warranty. Also call hand off between towers is non existing. Constantly dropping calls regardless of signal bars being three or more. Data performance I guess is ok but I primary use for calls and texting.",

I was nervous to by a brand I had not heard of but the price for what this offers was too good to pass up and I refuse to pay ridiculous money for a phone! so far I am very pleased. The phone is very impressive right out of the box. Much thinner than I expected with such a large battery life and it came with a case and screen protector already on it. I did have to buy a nano SIM for straight talk but it was like $4 on Amazon so not a big deal. I've loaded and tested all my favorite apps and everything works great. The display is beautiful, sounds are good, phone call sound quality is great, and my Fitbit works well with it. The only thing I haven't really tested too much so far is the camera. I snapped a few pics just to make sure it worked but as far as the quality of the camera I can't say just yet. However, I am very pleased with the phone overall and may even buy one for my husband.",

But theres zero LTE whatever, which any decent, new phone that has all the other features this one does, SHOULD HAVE!! So, sadly I returned mine. Wish it was what they say it is but it's not.

Bello da vedere, schermo grande, tutto funziona come dovrebbe, veloce e reattivo, non entra in difficolt\u00e0 neanche con i giochi pi\u00f9 impegnativi, la carica dura a lungo e la ricarica \u00e8 piuttosto breve. Ottima la ricezione del segnale, pi\u00f9 che buono l'audio, forte e nitido. Se volessi cercare il pelo nell'uovo parlerei di una fotocamera non eccellente, unico dettaglio che mi ha parzialmente deluso, funzione che comunque non m'interessa pi\u00f9 di tanto. Il rapporto qualit\u00e0 prezzo \u00e8 davvero buono, se paragonassimo questo prodotto a smartphone di marche pi\u00f9 blasonate ma con caratteristiche equivalenti, scopriremmo che andremmo a spendere quasi il doppio.
