I registered based on model number but it never fully functioned. Text were sporadic, calls went to VM outgoing calls not connected most of the time so I returned it.Other than that the phone was in great shape, it worked as expected other than the carrier issue.I returned the phone and was refunded quickly.I would purchase again if it suited my needs of a different carrier.I wont give a bad rating because the product itself was great, It could be Mint Mobiles issue for the compatibility and not the sellers issue.",
