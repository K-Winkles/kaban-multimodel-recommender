The big buttons and easy-to-use interface make it the perfect phone for elderly users. The SOS calling feature provides peace of mind, knowing that my grandfather can quickly and easily call for help if needed. The type-C charging dock is a great bonus and makes it easy for my grandfather to keep the phone charged and ready to use. The fact that the phone is unlocked allows us to choose a cell phone provider that best fits my grandfather's needs. The phone is durable, reliable and just what my grandfather needed. Overall, I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a simple and user-friendly cell phone for their elderly loved ones.",

                "reviewText": "I rarely write product reviews , but this product inspired me to. (I despired a word?) Right out of the box this phone felt cheap. Removing the back to get to the battery and Sim card confirmed it. Every single time I removed the back I thought I was going to break it. It was just a matter of time. Which would be fine if you only have to remove the back once in a while, but I had to remove it dozens of times in the first few hours of use. The instructions are horrible, but I managed to get it working. It worked for exactly 4 phone calls and then the screen said, \"Emergency Calls Only\" every time I tried to make a call. I figured that the card had to be reset or that I had to disconnect the battery to reset the phone (power cycling did nothing.) After popping the back off, again and again, I would manage to get it working, and then I would set it in the charger. A few hours later it would only allow emergency calls again. This happened every time I reset it. As for seniors? It's not nearly as simple as it could be. I could figure out how to use it, but my father struggled even though he did fine with the competition's phone that I eventually ended up getting him. If the phone worked I would give it 2 stars, but it didn't so I give it 1.",

I set up the phone with a T-mobile cell phone calling plan. 2 T-mobile workers installed a SIM card for their calling plans. The T-mobile workers at the sale point couldn't figure out how to get the password into the phone in order to make phone calls. The store personnel told me that phone was unable to process cell phone tower signals ( those workers suspect that this phone has a defective computer program ) . I'll be returning that phone.

She mentioned to me that she'd like the the cord that comes with, to hang around your neck so you can carry it. It makes it much easier for her to remember where it's at. I did have a glitch with the original purchase of the phone. But I contacted the company and they contact me right away. They replaced her phone right away. They have excellent customer service and kept in touch with me until my issue was resolved. Now Mama is very happy with her new phone....",

                "reviewText": "I love the look and feel of this phone, but that is it.It is supposed to be simple, but everything is a pain in the butt.After wasting my time with this (plus another similar phone from another maker before this, which I have extensively reviewed), I do not have enough patience to elaborate. I am just going to get a real phone from a real company.If you ONLY need to make phone calls, and you can remember all of your friends' phone numbers (like we used to in the 80's) or always flip through a phone book, this phone might be awesome.These are my thoughts after having this for a few weeks. I am glad that this phone is working out for others.",
