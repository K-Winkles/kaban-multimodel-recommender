                "reviewText": "Before I bought this phone, I asked the following question and got the the reply from Tracfone customer service.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Does this phone work for AT&T network Tracfone is using? I know Tracfone is now Verizon but they still use AT&T network for existing customers like me.asked on November 16, 2023Hi,No this phone is not compatible with tracfone/AT&T, is only compatible with tracfone/Verizon NetworkCustomer Service, Tracfone--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After I ordered and received this phone, I removed the SIM (already inserted in the slot and this SIM is for Verizon network only) from this phone and inserted my existing SIM taken from my old phone to this phone. My old existing SIM is for Tracfone/AT&T network. Unlike what Tracfone customer service claimed, this phone worked with Tracfone/AT&T network SIM without further doing anything. So, the phone is compatible with both Tracfone/AT&T and Tracfone/Verizon networks. It may be either because many customer service people are not very knowledgeable (not limited to Tracfone), the customer service person did not know this fact or Tracfone just wanted to hide the compatibility with AT&T to accelerate transition to Verizon network to avoid network usage payment to AT&T (if in the later case, it is a lie and Tracfone's practice is very bad though). With Tracfone/AT&T Sim, Wifi calling can also be activated (You need to wait about 20 minutes before you see \"+\" mark on the lower right side of the Wifi status icon on the top right side of your phone).The phone itself is fine. My old phone is Moto G Power 2020 and compared to the old one, the 2023 version does not have significant overall improvements and just fine. Battery life is noticeably shorter than 2020 version compared at the same brightness. CPU/GPU is slightly faster but not much, so not snappy but acceptable. The camera is decent and suffers in darkness showing noises. But after installing GCam mod, photo quality improved a lot.To turn off or reboot the phone easily, swipe down \"twice\", then you will see a power button icon on the lower right corner. Tap the power icon and select power off or reboot etc.Overall, Moto G Power 2023 version is a good buy for the money spent.",

U can add additional storage if needed. Moto is known for budget phones so if looking for a good deal and your not into expensive smartphones this has a huge 6.6 inch screen and fast speeds if u have a service in the newer 5g models. I find it's faster than my old Samsung galaxy.",
