The first one was silver & I baught it at metro. But this one from Amazon is FABULOUS! I've never seen a phone like this before. It's a mint green color & it's sooo pretty! Even the lady at Metro PCS thought it was unique. She said it's a high performing phone too. She wasn't trying to sell me anything either so, I believe her..lol. Anyhow, it works perfectly. It's 100% brand new & came in perfect samsung packaging. This is $100 cheaper on this app vs in store. I absolutely love this phone! I hope to get a a good 3 & a half years out of it.",

                "reviewText": "I was a little hesitant since this was the first phone by Samsung I bought that wasn't the main S series and I regret getting it.Pros:Camera - having a 50mp lens sounds nice and while having a higher mp for your camera sounds nice and is generally what you want, it's not something that's gonna make you tell everyone you know about. There's a mode on the A14 camera where you use it to it's potential and while it's noticeable, it's not a huge difference between my daily S10e.Sound - this phone can get very loud without headphones which can be either good or bad but if you're blasting the phone with no one caring around you, why can't this be just a good thing?Color - the huge screen is nice to watch shows/videos/movies on and the colors on it are very vivid--as expected from any Samsung phone. Also this green is a very nice color that most phones don't have as an option coming out of the box.Cons:Ram - now this was a HUGE reason why I decided to return this phone. It might be because it only has 4gb ram, or that the processor is different than the Snapdragon processors found in the S series phones, but this phone was very obviously, noticeably, and painfully slow. I'm a patient person but it got to the point where it was frustrating just opening an app that doesn't require much ram. When it came to streaming videos on YouTube that was fine, but doing some gaming or going on Instagram it was very laggy and felt delayed and slow with response time. This problem was more obvious on Instagram. All the videos were playing but the audio wasn't synced with the video and that goes to show you how slow the phone is. I've tried many ways to fix this issue; a clean reinstall, clearing cache, resetting the phone, but it kept persisting and Instagram is one of the apps I use often so having it continue was not going to work for me.NFC - although not a huge con, it is useful to have NFC on your phone whereas this version of the A14 doesn't come with NFC.No stereo speaker - this A14 doesn't have a speaker on the top side by the camera unlike most phones so when you're listening to anything on this phone, it's only coming from the bottom/right side of the phone by the charger.Touch responses - it might be paired with the ram/speed situation but the touch response was off about this phone. I use Gboard to swipe text and while I've had no problems using swipe text on my S10e, this one kept ending my swipes early, inputting words with letters I was never even close to swiping on. It made texting very frustating.Video recording - while the camera is nice, recording videos on this phone is very limited. You can't do 1080p 60fps so you're locked to 1080p 30fps which isn't bad but having the option would've been nice. Granted this phone was less than $200 so you might have expected less features.",
