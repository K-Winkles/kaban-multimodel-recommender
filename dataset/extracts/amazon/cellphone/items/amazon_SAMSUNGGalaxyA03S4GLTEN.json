The SIM port is badly damage and very cheaply made. It appears it\u2019s been used before the paint on it were already off. Since it\u2019s over a month and I didn\u2019t open it, I can not return it. I have bought a lot of Samsung like this even as a gift but this was very disappointing.",

                "reviewText": "Yes, I'm cheap. This phone is faster than my current one, but has about 1/2 the storage and fewer features, but cost about half as much. Although this device has an sd card slot, and you can move stuff to it, you cannot set it as internal, move apps to or set apps to use it by default, so it's requires a lot of effort to actually use it. I don't use a lot of apps, but the few I use I depend on regularly. 64GB is enough if I leave out a few niceties I've been using on my previous phone.Ultimately, save your money on the sd card and ignore it when you decide whether this phone has enough for you.",
