This phone was unlocked and it easily connected to my Verizon account.I have always been an android user and this is my second pixel phone, I don't have anything bad to say about it. The battery life easily gets me through a day and I watch videos and I am on it all the time. The recharge rate is slower than other phones but make sure you plug it in at night while you are sleeping and there is never an issue. I have even went two days without charging although half way through the second day, I did have to watch my use until I got back home.The phone is sleek, stylish, and easy to use. Google makes great phones. I haven't experienced any lag or any issues while texting, talking, or surfing the web. The memory is more than enough for me but I do know you can get them with more memory if needed. The updates are supposed to go well into 2028 (with the pixel 6) so you don't have to worry about that part being outdated. The phone is well built and I love it. I will stay with pixel phones in the future, every one I have had, has been a great phone.",

The only defects I have noticed are a few super tiny scratches on the bottom back glass and a little on the metal surrounding the camera visor. Otherwise; it is scratch free and even came with a screen protector.The phones performance is great. It is incredibly fast and has some groundbreaking smart \"AI\" features. Features such as \"Now Playing\" to keep a record of all songs that have played around you, automatic call screening, incredibly fast dictation, adaptive charging, and the camera is fantastic (Although it does seem like there is something under the lenses that flares when taking pictures at night).The battery life and finger print scanner are my two complaints. The battery is acceptable, but 6 to 7 hours of SOT is pretty bad for a modern phone. The finger print scanner is slow and often doesn't recognize my thumb.Overall; this is a much better option than any midrange device on the market.",

                "reviewText": "The phone works great. All functions and settings. The only negative shade I can cast on the device is the battery. Although I've been using it a lot since I first got it, the thing is in battery saver mode (auto on at 20%) from 100% charge pretty quick. Google says it will improve with software updates that come every month or so. We'll see about that.",

                "reviewText": "I am on a budget and opted for the Pixel 6 after researching many phones. I upgrade my phones every 2-3 years and the 8Gb of ram is what tipped the scale for me. My carrier only certified 4 brands on it's roaming network: Samsung, Apple, Google Pixels and Motorola. The listing mentioned it was a 9/10 but when I opened the box it had that new car smell and looked like it was never used so super happy on that front along with its super low price compared to other vendors on Amazon and other e-tailers. The phone is super fast and responsive when it comes to notifications like Ring and smart home functions. This phone pleasantly surprises me daily as I am still getting to know its features. My previous phone had dual sim slots which one of them was used with a 64GB memory card. This Pixel 6 has 128Gb of storage space with 1 sim slot so I can say goodbye to my memory card. The size of the phone fits just right in my hand. Watching content on the screen is great and the the audio is very good as well. Battery life is impressive and it does take a bit longer to charge than my previous phone but that's only because the battery capacity is larger. I've had the phone for 2+ weeks and have no complaints.",

                "reviewText": "Lo he probado para corroborar que todo le funciona, camaras, sensores, recepcion movi con telcel, por ahora todo esta como si de un celular nuevo se tratase. En cuanto a aspecto fisico, algunos ligeros ara\u00f1azos en la parte superior de las camaras traseras, donde el celular cambia de color, pero nada que manche la experiencia. Los marcos me dejaron asombrado, no tienen ni una sola abolladura (que es lo mas normal en equipos reacondicionados), la pantalla me llego como nueva, sospecho que esta es la parte restaurada del terminal, ya que tiene ligeras manchas blancas en la union de la pantalla con el cuerpo del celular, propias del pegamento que se les pone a las pantallas reparadas, lo veo de manera positiva ya que casi no se notan dichas manchas y obtuve una pantalla sin los comunes ara\u00f1azos que se crean al guardar tu celular en un bolsillo del pantalon. El envio tarda en iniciar, asi que si lo pides ten paciencia, pues los primeros dias (en mi caso 3) ni siquiera empezara el envio. El tiempo que tardo en llegar a mi casa despues de partir fue de 5 dias, un sabado.En general una muy buena experiencia, segun parece es un juego de azar el que te llegue un producto practicamente inservible o un celular en perfecto estado, yo creo que vale la pena el riesgo.",
