                "reviewText": "Umidigi G1 Max Review: A Budget Phone with Impressive Specs: I ordered this phone directly from Umidigi and received it very quickly, I have been using the device for almost a month now and wanted to leave a review to share my thoughts along with some benchmark scores from ANTUTU testing.The Umidigi G1 Max is a mid-range smartphone that offers some impressive features for its price. It has a large 6.52-inch IPS display, a 50MP main camera, a 5150mAh battery, and runs on Android 12. It also comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, which can be expanded up to 256GB with a microSD card. The phone is powered by the Unisoc Tiger T610 octa-core processor, which delivers decent performance and efficiency. All setup and app operations were performed smoothly and without and issues. I experienced no crashes or other negative performance issues throughout my time using this device.ProsThe Umidigi G1 Max has a sleek and stylish design, with a right-angle frame and a glossy back. It comes in two colors: Galaxy Blue and Starry Black. I received the Galaxy Blue and found this finish to be really quality and not a fingerprint magnet. Also Super Bonus, the device was delivered with a case which is awesome!The phone has a large and immersive display, with a 20:9 aspect ratio and a waterdrop notch. The screen has a resolution of 720 x 1600 pixels, which is adequate for watching videos and browsing the web.The phone has a powerful 50MP main camera, which can capture detailed and vivid photos in various scenarios. It also has a 2MP depth camera for portrait mode, and an 8MP selfie camera. The phone supports night mode, HDR, panorama, and 1080p video recording. I had no issues watching videos or editing photos all were done with speed and ease.The phone has a massive 5150mAh battery, which can last for more than a day of moderate use. It also supports fast charging with a 10W charger included in the box. - I never had an issue with the battery running out before a full day of use which I cannot say the same for other devices I have used lately.The phone runs on Android 12, which offers enhanced privacy features, dynamic personalization, and faster app startup. The phone also has minimal bloatware and offers a smooth user experience.The phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor and face unlock, which are fast and convenient to use. It also has other sensors such as accelerometer, proximity, and compass.The phone supports global bands, dual SIM, dual standby, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, BDS, and USB Type-C. It does not have NFC though.ConsThe Umidigi G1 Max has a low screen resolution compared to other phones in its price range. It also has thick bezels around the display, which reduce the screen-to-body ratio.The phone does not have a dedicated microSD slot, but uses a hybrid SIM slot instead. This means that users have to choose between dual SIM or extra storage.The phone does not have a 3.5mm headphone jack, which may disappoint some users who prefer wired headphones. It also does not have stereo speakers or Dolby Atmos support.ConclusionThe Umidigi G1 Max is a budget-friendly smartphone that offers some impressive specs for its price. It has a large display, a powerful camera, a huge battery, and Android 12. It also has ample RAM and storage space, and supports global bands. All around a great device that checks in much higher performance wise than the low price tag would otherwise indicate!!",

                "reviewText": "I've been using the Umidigi G1 Max heavily for over a week now and I am going to share some of my observations. This smartphone has several exceptional features that are not usually found at its budget price; there are also some improvements that I think could be made to future versions. Overall though, this phone is a great option for those who are looking for an unlocked, stock Android 12 smartphone without spending a lot of money.Unboxing the Umidigi (pronounced You-Mi-Digi) G1 Max came with a pleasant surprise. Inside it came with a charger, red USB type-C cable, clear case, and a pre-applied screen protector. I still appreciate getting the necessary equipment with my purchases!Off the bat, the speed of the CPU is remarkable for this price range. The Unisoc Tiger T610 8-core processor handled any task I threw at it well. Scrolling around social media was smooth and Android was responsive. Even gaming was (mostly) a great experience. Call of Duty ran smoothly at medium settings, however, Diablo Immortal was unplayable because of render issues. I attribute this to the Unisoc CPU being a relative newcomer to the mobile phone arena. This chip sure beats the 4-core processors we used to be stuck with!The internal storage is awesome, at 128 gigabytes it is twice as much as similar phones.It has a dual-sim capability is a neat feature that I can see myself using when I go on vacation this year.There is no bloatware whatsoever on this phone, just stock Android 12. I prefer Android 12 to custom interfaces, like Samsung's for example. I'm also grateful that I don't have to spend time uninstalling apps that I'll never use.The rear camera is good when there is plenty of light, as it should be at 50 megapixels. The photos from the front camera are a little soft, but it does the job and would work well for video conferencing.The battery life is terrific! At 5150 mah, it is larger than you will usually find in a phone at this size or cost; most being only 4000 mah. I could spend 11 hours watching youtube videos non-stop before having to charge it. I even verified the size using the AccuBattery app and it checked out as a legit rating.The screen resolution is 1600x720, which is lower than most mid or high-range phones. However, it is a quality screen. The brightness and colors are good. It compares very well to my iPhone XR's Liquid Retina display. I was hard-pressed to tell the difference. I would prefer a higher-resolution display, but I can't complain too much because of the price.I would recommend this phone to someone who was looking to spend under $150, with the caveat that they make sure it is compatible with their wireless provider.",
