I am extremely impressed with how quickly it charges. Probably about 20 to 30 minutes for full charge using the provided c to c cable and block. Has great sound. Very quick I can ask on it well. Overall the best bang for your buck. Came with a clear case charger cord and block starter kit and a pre-installed screen protector Thank God cuz I struggle with those every time Love it",

                "reviewText": "I initially purchased this phone because my previous phone didn't have a removable battery and completely shut down on me. Meanwhile this phone was on sale around the holiday season so I went for it. I really regret this decision because this phone doesn't easily allow me to use my phone data, the picture quality is poor, the speaker phone is as loud as a regular call, the phone is slow ...etc. I'm giving this particular phone a thumbs down.Although I am not satisfied with this purchase, the company was very helpful and quick to rectify my issues. Most companies ignore their customers but this one did not. I value companies that put forth great efforts into their customer satisfaction. However, now I know that in the future, it would be in my best interest to purchase a more expensive phone with all of the bells and whistles so that I'd have better success from the start.",
