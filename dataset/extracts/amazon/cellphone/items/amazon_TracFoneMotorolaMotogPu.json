                "reviewText": "Amazing phone for the moneyLenovo has done a fantastic job since it acquired Motorola.Like my prior Motorola fones, this one has minimal bloatware for a near stock Android experience.Just a few easy to remove pre-installed games, and easy to remove Facebook app as well.FM radio app can't be removed, but it was easy to deactivate.Note:This fone will not work with a T-Mobile SIM, it requires a TracFone SIM.Even though TracFone does use in fact use T-Mobile towers, amongst others.Does work perfectly with my Walmart Family Mobile SIM card (running T-Mobile), as WFM is 100% owned by TracFone.Therefore, my WFM SIM is actually a Tracfone SIM card, connecting to the T-Mobile network.No tweaks during set up were needed, such as modifying the Access Point Name (APN).Put my SIM in, powered up, and followed prompts during set up.Even better, wirelessly copied all settings and apps from my old fone.Followed prompts on both fones, to both grant and accept permission to copy.With 55 apps, took about 1 hour, but a very easy and automated process.Only \"downside\" of fone is large size, which is a plus for many.But, I'm quickly getting used to moving from a 5.5 inch phone, to this 6.5 inch.Also, greatly appreciate moving from a 16GB phone to this 32GB.Being able to keep as many Apps as one likes, and without needing to clear cache weekly to free up space for existing apps, is a huge upgrade, and big convivence.Yes, Apps can stored on an SD, but it's already near full of music, movies, and photos.I'm not a \"gamer\" so the 3GB of RAM works perfectly.No lags even when multi-tasking, etc.My only multi-tasking is listening to music via streaming or via an app from SD stored music, while a fitness tracker in running.Worked fine with prior Moto e6 2GB RAM fone, and still no problem with this 3GB RAM fone.",

                "reviewText": "Overall basic phone but has a lot of capabilities. Great price on a great network.I purchased this phone to replace my husband BLU two tracfone which was literally a piece of trash just because the slowness, etc.This phone has a noticeable fast response on the screen etc. it holds a charge for a good time. It is a fairly large phone I suggest a case because I can see how it would be easily breakable. The screen is large and bright.",

                "reviewText": "This phone is solid, nice feel, good weight, attractive in looks and easy to use. For it's price, it is a great phone. Even though my previous phone still works great, it is 16 GB and I was running out of memory for apps. I had to start removing apps as with each update of each app, they seemed to bloat taking up more and more memory. That led me to needing a new phone with 32 GB of memory which led me to this phone. Previously I always used LG Tracfones but I read LG is no longer making inexpensive Tracfones which is probably why they are no longer on Tracfone's website. I always wondered how the Motorola phones were so when I saw this at a great price I bought it. I have not connected it to Tracfone service yet as I want to have it setup to my liking before I do. Even though it is still Android there are some differences with the Moto settings and its use of the features that make me prefer the LG phones but nothing that would make me not like it or want to use it. My only complaint is no where on the Amazon listing for this phone did it say whether it is GSM or CDMA so I don't know whether Tracfone in my area will accept this phone. The packing list said CDMA but according to Motorola's website it is GSM. Then I read that Tracfone was bought by Verizon and as of November 2023 Tracfone plans will be changed. There is some confusion whether Verizon is still CDMA or not. So I don't know whether I will be able to use this phone after Verizon takes over. Or whether I would stay with Verizon depending on their pricing policies for previous Tracfone customers. But it is still a great phone so far.",

Only one shipped. These were ordered well in advance for gifts for my children, I only recieved one. When I called to ask about it, all I was told was item has not shipped. No kidding? I can see that for myself, my question is why can I not contact this particular seller, and why when my account was debited were my items not shipped.Do not recommend. I suggest another retailer. I would give zero stars if possible.",
