                "reviewText": "First off, it took a month to arrive to me from the order date, so I was not impressed with that, HOWEVER, I will look past that and just review the phone. I will try to be detailed as I know I read hundreds of reviews before finally feeling secure with my purchase, so hopefully I can help someone out here.The box it arrived in was old and dirty so I was extremely nervous to open it, but once I did I was very impressed. The phone itself was in phenomenal, like new condition. I was very happy to see everything included in the box (sim key ejector, charging cable, plug in adapter) so that was great since some of the reviews I read said parts were not included or missing, ect.The phone needed to be charged right away, and as soon as I plugged in it, the included wall adapter started making a very high pitched buzzing sound, so I swapped it out with a different adapter I already had on hand (you can get them anywhere so not a big deal) and problem was instantly solved.I am completely unfamiliar with Samsung phones, so I was worried about set up, but once I was easily able to change the language from Spanish to English, it was pretty easy to do.I really liked how crisp and clear the graphics were and the phone has a great screen size for gaming. I will say that in my opinion the phone is pretty laggy in loading, but my 12 year old doesn\u2019t really seem to mind and after pretty much living on it for the past two days, it\u2019s safe to say he loves the phone.It took some doing to familiarize ourselves with it, and found it was not as user friendly as an iPhone, but once you figure out how to actually gets the apps on the Home Screen and change the clock, ect, you\u2019re good to go.Pros: great screen size, clear graphics, amazing battery life, 12 year old approved.Cons: A little laggy, not the most user friendly until you get used to it, weird buzzing adaptor.Note: we have not tried installing a SIM card as of yet, so I can\u2019t attest to that.So far this phone has been great, well worth the purchase price, and my son is extremely happy with it, so for that, I would absolutely recommend it.",
