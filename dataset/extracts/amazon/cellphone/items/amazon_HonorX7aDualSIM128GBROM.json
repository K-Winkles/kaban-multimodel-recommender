The ram on this phone is double my previous.I needed a phone that didn't need frequent deleting of apps and photos to create space. This phone has 7 times the storage of my previous.I also wanted a big screen. This would enable me to have a phone, rather than phone and tablet.Other things I wanted were a phone that would have manufacturer updates for a while to come. Unlocked for any sim. Decent reviews. A trusted manufacturer. And of course most importantly I needed it available at amazon due to their excellent customer service.A month after purchase, and I don't think I could have picked a better mobile.",
