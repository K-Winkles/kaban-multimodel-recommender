Again, taking hours to recharge.At one point I was able to use the phone, but calls were dropped. The features were wonky and would not always allow me to perform certain functions. ie: create a contact or speed dial. This took up a lot of time and caused frustration.So my summary is this - I am a technically savvy individual and it was difficult and sometimes impossible for me to set up and use this phone, causing major frustrations. This is being advertised as a phone suited for seniors? Well, this was never able to make it to my mom's hands in which it was intended. She does not need anything super techy or savvy like an iphone, but she certainly needs something that is dependable when she needs it.",

However, to use that service they would send out a SIM card to place in a phone. It is difficult to find an unlocked flip phone that will accommodate this type of SIM card. What I loved from the description is that they had an IMEI number so I could use that to go back to the website for the phone service and confirm it was compatible. I assisted my client in purchasing this through my prime account (as she didn't have one) and once received I set it up for her. It was super easy to set up and she learned to use it very quickly. I like the charging stand which allows her to charge it easily which she couldn't do with a standard plug in charge. I also love the lanard that it comes with as now we can have her ride medical transport services independently and ensure her phone doesn't get lost. All in all this phone has been fabulous and I highly recommend.",
