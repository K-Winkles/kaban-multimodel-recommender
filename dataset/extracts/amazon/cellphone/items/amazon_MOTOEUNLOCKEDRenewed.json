I decided to try this reconditioned phone and so far it is performing to my liking. The touch screen is responsive and bright. It is light and easy to carry, battery life is very good and more importantly, I have found it easy to use. The camera works well as long as you have good lighting. If you want to work in low light situations then look elsewhere as the camera on this phone is weak in this regard. Bluetooth and wireless function very well, no issues with Internet connections. Sound is very good as well. It is pretty much stock Android, so transitioning from my old phone to this one was easy. My requirements are pretty basic and this phone gives me all I need at an affordable price. I would recommend if all you need is a good basic Android phone.",

                "reviewText": "Recently my ancient Samsung Galaxy S5 gave out, and I went hunting for a nice, mid-priced upgrade. This \"renewed\" Moto G Fast seemed to fit the bill. It doesn't seem to have Wi-Fi calling, but I don't really ever use that feature and wasn't concerned.It arrived neatly repackaged back in the original box (taped shut securely), and it was very clean when I took it out of the box. The USB cable and charger plug were still in their original factory wrapping. The \"SIM Tool\" was on its original cardboard holder, but the holder showed signs that someone had used the tool once before (as would be expected).Inserting the SIM and my SD card was easy standard procedure if you've ever done that on an iPhone. Once turned on, the Moto G Fast recognized my AT&T SIM and got right to business of running the setup wizards.Since then, I've been pretty impressed. It IS FAST compared to any phone I've used or seen lately, and the screen quality is awesome. I've only taken a few pics, but the quality looks good. It has a nice solid feel, and everything works as expected.The only issue I had was that my LTE mobile data seemed to be non-existent. I was creeping along at .19mbps. However, I read about a trick that all you have to do is turn on Airplane Mode for a few seconds and then turn it off. I did that, and now the speed tests show freakishly fast mobile data.From my experience so far, I would say that you can't go wrong with this phone.",

                "reviewText": "There does seem to be a bit of bloat in terms of the space the OS takes up. On previous Motorolas, about 30-40% of the 32 gig space would be taken up by OS installs. On this phone, it is around 50-55%.Also, getting used to the gesture navigation (new to me) has been a bit of a learning curve. But you just have to build up that muscle memory.",

Entered the IMEI in my providers website and was told that IMEI is not available for that carrier. Taking it to the brick and mortar for one last try with tech support. If the phone is still locked I will drop this review to one star and initiate the return. Very disappointed in the false listing.**UPDATE*** Confirmed with carrier tech support in person and on phone, this phone is locked to a different carrier. Also, when performing a hard reset, the system data indicated \"oem_locked\". Dropping the review to 1 Star for false advertising.",
