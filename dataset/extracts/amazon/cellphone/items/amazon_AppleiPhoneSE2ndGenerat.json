It came with an instruction book and new charger packaged neatly in an iPhone box as if purchased new. And the beauty was shiny red and not a single mark or smudge or figerprint on it. No scratches anywhere. It works so smoothly and quickly with the lightest touch. I bought it as a gift but after seeing this one, I'm thinking about getting one for myself as well. My friend says the battery life is amazing and they absolutely love it. Definitely recommend this purchase to anybody looking for a great phone at an awesome price.

                "reviewText": "I am so happy with this phone! I was about to buy from another well known site that sells used phones when I discovered that amazon sells refurbished ones and that are fully operational, checked for quality, have a 90 day warranty AND are unlocked!. My 11 yr old daughter had an iphone SE since she was 7 and took good care of it till it accidentally slipped from her hand onto concrete. Even though she was very responsible with it for a long time, I still dont see the sense in getting a brand new phone and spending hundreds of dollars on it for a kid. Even adults have accidents with their phones sometimes and I think the chances are higher with a kid. So when I discovered this option I was overjoyed. It does everything she wants to do - call, text, go on the internet, download apps and games and hers has 5G (careful because I think amazon also sells a 2G one, so I made sure to get this one that says 5G). And this way, if she has a horrible accident with it, Im not out hundreds of dollars. The one she got looks almost new, only a very light scratch on the back which is covered with a case anyway. All we had to do was take her sim card out if her old phone and put it in the new phone and then it asked if we had a nearby apple device we\u2019d like to sync it with (in this case, her tablet) and it walked us through that process. It really couldn\u2019t have been easier! The phone even came with a little tool for getting the sim card out! And a generic brand charger to charge the phone with. I am SO happy with this purchase! Thank you Amazon for having these available at an affordable price!! Affordable options like this are why I keep shopping with Amazon! Oh and the battery health was pretty good, better than my current phone! Maximum charging capacity 91%. For a refurbished phone that is excellent",

                "reviewText": "This is the best phone I\u2019ve ever owned, in my opinion. I\u2019m passionate about smartphones, and I\u2019ve loved previous high end Androids. This has a few key advantages over those devices.Simplicity. I used to compile my own Gentoo. I understand the value of FOSS. Still, I\u2019ve come to decide that a personal communicator/ data assistant needs to be usable above all else. iOS is feature-complete, thoughtfully efficient, and free of redundancy beyond Android. The toddler\u2019s interface i used on the iPod touch has matured into what it was meant to beReliability. I\u2019ve never had big problems with Android, but it can hiccup. On every phone I\u2019ve used over more than a decade, I\u2019ve occasionally experienced minor crashes, GPS gremlins, battery drains, cooling anomalies, and inscrutable major app discontinuations. In nearly a year of use, this old midrange iPhone has been utterly rock solid and i am confident Apple will not yank the rug out from under any of its core utilities. I do not manage the RAM on this phone or track battery usage. It\u2019s just normal at all times.Durability. I do not use phone cases. The concept is a bit bizarre to me from a design standpoint. It\u2019s not ideal, but i just try to be very careful with my phone. I\u2019m good enough at it that, since smartphones emerged, it has been overall worth it for me despite eventually breaking two phones in that period. Still, I\u2019m aging and I\u2019ve dropped it. It\u2019s clear that this phone is comprehensively designed; the materials and structure are unbelievably resistant to impact on hard surfaces. The damage to my phone is entirely cosmetic to the aluminum frame, and frankly makes me smile that it worked as intended in the face of adversity.Performance. My last phone had significantly more raw computing power than this phone. Still, this phone has a smoother UI and, in my opinion, marks a significant point of diminishing returns in mobile processing power. Clearly, little of the hardware is wasted. It is well balanced.Criticisms include: the ability to edit large blocks of text in iMessage has degraded since the last update. Moving the cursor has become more difficult. Battery life is mediocre. I can confidently get a day of normal use or a few hours of streaming video, and i have to charge it every night. My refurbished phone arrived with a gouge in the screen which i consider barely acceptable.The experience is great. I\u2019ve lost interest in cracking software and customizing each UI element with unlimited freedom in favor of a workflow that aligns with my long-term goals. In that regard this phone excels. Lovely bit of hardware and software.",

                "reviewText": "We're getting what we hoped to from this phone as far as performance, and are happy with it and satisfied with what we paid. The two things that knock it from a 5 to 4 star review are screen and battery life. Don't get me wrong, they're both fine and there was no false advertising. But I suppose there's some luck of the draw: I had read others who bought the same three-year old phone and had battery health in the 90s and zero scratches. This phone has a battery capacity at 80%, which is within the advertised range but barely [\"minimum 80%\"]. There's also minor cosmetic scratches on the screen. But no qualms with speed and performance",

                "reviewText": "I got the premium refurbished phone and the first one was good and came fast - 94% battery and very miniscule scratches here and there - but the top speaker was tinny. So I contacted the seller via Amazon, and they let me exchange the phone, no problem. When I explained the issue, they noted that they might have a better phone if I changed color - so I did. The next phone was even better! Everything seems to work great so far, and I like having the 1 year warranty. Thanks Hybrid IT!",

Est\u00e9ticamente es impecable, no le encontr\u00e9 ni un solo ray\u00f3n a contraluz; adem\u00e1s llega en una caja muy bonita de Amazon refurbished con documentaci\u00f3n como si fuera nuevo. El m\u00edo ven\u00eda con 92% de vida de bater\u00eda original. Funcionamiento del sistema, pagos en NFC, etc sin problema alguno. Si no eres un usuario intensivo te puede durar una carga todo el d\u00eda sin problema; yo alcanzo a usarlo en el gimnasio por la noche y me queda buena carga al cargarlo al ir a dormir. El Bluetooth igual rapid\u00edsimo tanto en aud\u00edfonos como en coche. El wifi aleatoriamente puede perderse en estado de reposo pero he visto que es un problema m\u00e1s o menos frecuente en iOS, por lo que no depende del vendedor. Estoy de verdad muy satisfecho en relaci\u00f3n costo-beneficio.Ahora, dicho lo anterior, yo lo compr\u00e9 $1000 m\u00e1s barato. No estoy seguro si pagar\u00eda casi 5k por un SE 2020 o gastar un poquito m\u00e1s en un iPhone Mini 12 o 13. Aunque este iPhone a\u00fan tiene mucha vida y est\u00e1 en muy buenas condiciones, iOS 17.3 ya lo siente un poquito en animaciones. Si puedes vivir con esto, es un excelente tel\u00e9fono que puede durar algunos a\u00f1os m\u00e1s; al menos es lo que yo planeo que me dure. Actualizar\u00e9 este review a los 6 meses o que algo falle, lo que ocurra primero.",
