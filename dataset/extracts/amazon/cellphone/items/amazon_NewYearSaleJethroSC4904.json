                "reviewText": "Purchased this for my autistic cousin. Wanted to get rid of her landline, but had trouble teaching her to use a smart phone. Needed something simple with no internet. This fits the bill perfectly. Charges on a stand similar to her old cordless phone so I don\u2019t have to worry about her not plugging it in. Nice big numbers that she can easily see. She is a little hard of hearing, but she has no trouble hearing this phone ring. I love the fact that you can set it to automatically go to speaker phone when she makes or receives a call. Best part is the price of service. $100 for a year of unlimited calls. Landline had gone up to $50 a month, and was out of service about 4 or 5 times a year. If you have an elderly relative, or someone who lacks the finesse or mental capacity to operate a smartphone, you should give this a try. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with this purchase.",

She keeps confusing it with a remote control. To be fair she hasn't used a cell phone in years; just the old fashion push button landline. I set it up and it was easy, I set it up to answer on speaker and the sound quality is good. I would recommend it for seniors. Just not mine. :(",

Two years ago we got her the Lively flip phone and it helped for awhile but with a hefty monthly charge for the plan. When that phone died, I did alot of research because she really needed to have an option for when she was away from the house. This is perfect! No data, just unlimited talk and text. We were able to port her number. I set up Photo Dial for the 7 people she calls, and i could set up the emergency button on the back to text me and not call 911 - couldn't be easier and the phone and 1 year of service was $150! She still struggles, believe it or not, but were getting there. Highly recommend if you're in this situation.",

The local phone company wanted to charge a ridiculous monthly fee just for basic phone service! The Jethro phone offers just what I needed, an easy to use, inexpensive phone so that I can keep in touch with my mom. I was especially looking for a cellphone that is easy to charge. My mom can just keep it in the charging base! The phone came with a SIM card and was very easy to set up. Very happy with my purchase, so far.",

                "reviewText": "It is adequate and airtime pricing is good. The manual is also basic. It does not say how to connect incoming calls quickly to voicemail which is mostly what I wanted this phone for. Callers have to wait until it rings 6 - 7 times and often that is too long to wait and I get a lot of hang ups. Also, and the worst thing, is that the phone number I was given belonged to someone else and I immediately started getting telemarketing phone calls. This happened with 20 minutes of activating my phone and has continued over time. Telemarketers do not give up. It is frustrating that symbols appear in the corner of the screen that are not listed in the manual and it takes trial and error to resolve this. Currently, I have the symbol for a voicemail message and yet when I try to retrieve the message, I am told there are no messages. I am glad this is just a supplemental phone. It serves some of its purpose but I do not have to rely on it for everything.",
