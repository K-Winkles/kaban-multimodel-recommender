I can't barely type anything the keyboard is so tiny.And the performance is horrible. I expect that I can't be doing too much with it because it's mini but c'mon now. It should be faster than that. I just got it and downloaded one app. And it's the only app I needed to use on it because I am not permitted to have it on my other phone because I use the other phone for work sometimes.

                "reviewText": "This \"phone\" is exactly what I was looking for. It can play mp3s and podcasts. I use it with bluetooth headphones while going on walks and runs and so far it has been great.Positives:- Small enough to fit in a sleeve with my water bottle and not feel the additional weight- Bluetooth works well enough, so I don't have to use wired headphones while running- Google podcasts works flawlessly on itNegatives:- CPU is weak, so the phone is really slow (doesn't matter too much after setting everything up though)- Phone is using very old tech, so I doubt any carrier will support it (doesn't matter for my use case)- The small screen and old OS means a lot of apps won't work (Android 6.0 with no updates available)- The battery is small due to the size and drains fairly quickly even when not in use- Bluetooth connection is weak, so the phone has to stay closeEven with all the negatives, I don't regret this purchase. I charge it before I go out and it can easily play music for 3 or 4 hours. If you are looking for a simple little mp3 player with bluetooth, this is not the worst choice.",

For this purpose it works great and these phones are kinda neat to us. You cannot use 3G phones as phones in the US any longer. To my knowledge, all major and most (if not all) minor carriers have completely moved to 4G and 5G. So if you're think of buying this to use as an actual phone, DO NOT! Search out the other one that is 4G.",
