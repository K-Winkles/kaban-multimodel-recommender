                "reviewText": "Brought to Metro Mobile. They added the sim card and it was working fine when I left the store. About 10 minutes later it went into Emergency Calls Only mode. I was trying out the SOS button so i though I did something. Then I noticed there was a No Sim Card icon, and no network connection. I brought it back to Metro Mobile, they reset it, still did not work. They then called the corporate for help and they reset the network connection (what ever that is) and it still did not work. Ultimately told me it was not compatible with Metro Mobile (T-Mobile) network. Even though description on page says it is.",

I set up a monthly plan with speed talk and then things came to a direct halt. The phone wouldn't go past the emergency setting. No matter what we tried. Why is this still an issue if its Bern reported before? Don't waste peoples time . I have spent hours hoping to resolve this issue to no avail. Either fix it or take it down until its worth selling. This will also be returned ...Time wasted.....",
