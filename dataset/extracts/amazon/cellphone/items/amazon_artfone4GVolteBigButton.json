Finally got around to looking at it myself and the phone says it is charged but does not function unless plugged in. Past the return window at this point so I'm out the cash, I'll let you know if the seller reaches out to offer a replacement. Perhaps it's a defective battery or maybe they are all junky?",

We hooked her up with Bell which has the closes cell tower but reception seems to go in and out a lot ranging from no reception to 4 bars. My phone is with a discount carrier and I only get 1 bar in her house but it's far more stable than her artphone. I can't really recommend this phone for seniors.",
