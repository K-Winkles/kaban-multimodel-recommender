                "reviewText": "i won't recommend this phone at all. I bought several of them as Christmas gifts and none functions. Unfortunately they were taken to Africa and for logistic reasons i can't return them to the dealer. I am very upset about the phone quality and wonder why Amazon allow such poor quality products to be marketed on her platform. I bought 5 phones in all and none functions properly. Shame to the dealer! I have given one star to the rating because it's mandatory.",

Have not tried to get phone service hooked up yet, i have a feeling that will not go great either. Should have bought a Walmart phone.",
