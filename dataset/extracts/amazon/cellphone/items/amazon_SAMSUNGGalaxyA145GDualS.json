Adding an external mic is not easy because of the different TRRS standard used in this device. An external mic connected via the usb-c port has a time lag which makes it unusable for certain apps. Overall, no good solution for the very poor in-built microphone. Samsung, if you are listening, you can spend just a little more to install a decent mic for your devices.Battery is just okay, and camera is quite decent. Overall, it's only 3 stars for my needs.",
