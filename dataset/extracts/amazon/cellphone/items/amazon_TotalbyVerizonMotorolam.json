Out of all the phones you can buy I think this one has the best value for the money and I've been using them for years now. When this phone breaks I'll just buy another one exactly like it. Since it's a Motorola phone it has karate chop flashlight. All you have to do is make a karate chop motion with the phone and the light turns on and that's pretty awesome. A twisting motion will quickly access your camera for pictures or videos. The pictures are not the best but it's not something that is very important to me in the pictures I've taken have been fine. If you really care for that sort of thing you should get a really expensive phone. Look no further. This is the good simple phone that you need. My favorite part is that when I'm on a boat and I dropped my phone into the Gulf of Mexico I can just laugh because it really is no big deal at this price. When I smash my screen I have a chuckle and reorder another one before the screen is unusable.",

One might be inclined to think this was a good thing? Not so, or at least for me this model is much more....\"Glitchy\" and less user friendly. Don't get me wrong is basically the same phone and I'm sure overtime I would adjust to the few differences. However, after having the phone just 2 days the phone started slowing way down...I mean a very noticeable difference from the first 1/2 day (I was waiting for the it to say \"Do you want to play a game?\")Worse is about 2 hours ago the phone started an android update and has not stopped shutting down and each time it comes on it says \"update is complete\" ten mins later...repeat....repeat....etc it repeats the message in the attached pic after each restart? I'm starting the return now.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased 2 phones. One for me and one for husband. My phone is great. But after one week my husband's phone started experiencing sound problems. Didn't want to try to return it because we had already set it up and transferred phone number and service from old phone to this one . It would have meant having to transfer everything back to old phone while waiting for a replacement and then transferring everything again to replacement phone. Just very disappointed that this happened. Thankfully it wasn't very expensive. Hopefully I won't have the same problem with mine. I love mine. Have had it for 2 months now. So far so good.Fingers crossed \ud83e\udd1e",
