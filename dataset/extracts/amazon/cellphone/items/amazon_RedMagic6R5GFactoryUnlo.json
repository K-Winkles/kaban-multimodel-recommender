                "reviewText": "Prior reviews of this phone are spot on with their Pros. I love everything gaming about it. The misconception here is that several complain about it not working on US networks. I have mine on Ting and they use T-Mobile and yes it will work on T-Mobile as well. 5G connection is great have no issues with networking either. It will not work on Cricket, been there done that. Cricket was my original provider.Now for the buggy parts. I returned one and now may return another. The issue on both so far is that when I make a call to someone they can't hear me but I hear them. I found out if I put them on speaker phone and then off speaker phone they hear me. Now this only has happened so far on cell to cell calls.The second bug is those I call can hear themselves echo back. No matter what setting I toy with it does not clear it up even with the volume down to almost unhearable. The work around for echo calls is to use a headset. To me this would make me think that there is no buffer between the speaker and mic in the phone and it is not an issue with the service provide.Do not rely on ZTE nubia support if you buy on Amazon they will not offer it. I have reached out to ZTE nubia about this issue and they have ignored me thus far.UPDATE: Upon reading through reviews on another site I was able to find another user with the same issues. He solved the issue with no help from nubia. The fix was simply switching from sim slot one to sim slot two. I did the same and Magic! It worked.",

                "reviewText": "I had very high hopes for this phone judging from the specs and judging by the bands under which it would receive and use 5G. Understanding it is a budget phone with very high-end features, it is useless to me if it cannot work in the 5G realm!That is to say simply that if I'm paying for 5G I expect my phone to work in 5G, and if the phone advertises that it is a 5G phone and that it DOES work with GSM networks, of which T-Mobile is a GSM, then it should NOT say 4G!Even the folks at the local T-Mobile store cannot get it to register as 5G and suggested something could possibly be wrong with the phone or that it needed to be updated. All the updates were installed, so it has to be a defective phone if it is supposed to work in the 5G realm!I am returning it at this point because it is useless to me as is. On many ads from phones it lists the many bands the phone will operate within and even if the bands match the phones capability, it still may not work, and this one did not!This one did NOT come with an adapter for American use. I contacted the company and they NEVER even responded! Changing my rating to ONE!",

I have enabled all of the 5G options that I can find in the settings, and I have a 5G data plan with AT&T and am in a 5G coverage area, but I have not been able to get the phone in 5G mode no matter where I go. Also, what I thought were stereo speakers on the edge beside the cameras turned out to be left and right shoulder triggers, so all of the sound comes from the right/bottom edge when the phone is turned for horizontal viewing. (edit) While I was using this phone connected to my car via USB Android Auto, music would play very flat with no low-mids or bass, although everything sounded good if connected via bluetooth. Sound equalizer adjustments made no difference at all, and it did not matter what application I used for playing music. I thought it was the car because I had just purchased it recently, as well, but I connected my old phone the same way and it sounded fine.",
