                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this TCL 40 X 5G Unlocked Phone and I must say, it's quite impressive. The 6.56-inch HD+ display is vibrant and sharp, making videos and games look stunning. The 5G connection is lightning-fast, and I can stream high-quality content without any buffering. I used to use a Samsung A53 cell phone, and on the recommendation of a friend, I bought this one from TCL. This phone meets my needs perfectly and is a great choice for under $200!The 5000mAh battery is a game-changer. I use my phone extensively throughout the day, and this battery easily lasts from morning to night with plenty to spare. It's such a relief not to worry about constantly charging my phone.The 50MP main camera delivers some excellent shots. Whether I'm taking photos in broad daylight or low light conditions, the quality is consistently good. The Android 13 system is smooth and responsive, and it comes with some useful features and customization options.The 4GB RAM and 64GB ROM storage provide ample space for apps, photos, and videos, but I would have appreciated more RAM for even smoother multitasking. Overall, this is a fantastic 5G phone with great features, and the price is reasonable for what you get. I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "My galaxy a10e that i've had for 3 years now, just busted. This was considerably discounted and caught my eye, so I bought it. So far, its great. Its much faster, bigger and better to use than the a10e. I was panicking because I didn't think to by a sim card, but I found out I could just pop the one in my galaxy in this. Overall its just better in every way.For the price I paid, the phone has a lot of features and hardware that I'm impressed with. 6 gigs of ram and a decent amount of onboard storage, large and clear screen, good weight, and decent camera. Yeah, it's obviously not doing anything crazy in terms of specs compared to more expensive phones, but If you're looking for something unlocked, not bottom of the barrel, and can actually pass for a decent modern phone, then I'd get this.This is a pic of boxman I took with the camera in pro mode. Not the best features, but if you actually care about the image you're going to edit it with something else anyway.Pros:Really decent specs all around for the priceStereo audioDecent CameraGreat PriceAndroid 12unlockedfingerprint scannerComes with a clear silicon casefast charging (pretty fast)+ a bunch of small bells and whistlesCons:-Setting a custom notification or ringtone is a hassle with the stock system as the default apps can't really be changed(as far as I know)-Good luck finding a decent case for this, even ON amazon (ali has some custom ones you can make, but no they're mostly silicone)-A fair amount of bloat. luckily you can uninstall a lot of it. Though there's still some left over.-Default apps are... not great. Good luck changing them.-while the internal storage is decent, i'd suggest getting an microsd. It supports up to 512gb I think.",

                "reviewText": "Cons,The screen is not pure inky black and has poor side viewing.The cameras are not world class.Feels sluggish at times.You need high sensitivity, low impedance headphones to get the most out of the 3.5mm headphone jackPROsThe screen gets BRIGHT, and when looking at the phone head on, it is vivid and clearThe camera app is intuitive, easy to use, and pro mode is a bunch of fun... for me anyway!after 3-4 hours of updates, disabling\\removing bloatware and unwanted programs, the phone feels responsive and I'm able to play hill climb racing 2 without any hiccups.As a phone goes, everyone says my voice is clear, not much low end in the ear speaker from the other person, but it goes loud and it is clear, same goes for the stereo speakers at the bottom, speakerphone works well, there is no time warp delay, or hearing yourself when you call.I believe I have actually upgraded my phone, as a phone. My note 20 ultra 5g SUCKED as a phone constantly dropping calls.This phone feels premium in the had and the cameras are protected by the thinnest of phone cases. the clear included case works perfectly fine!______________________________________________________________________________I am very happy with it, overall.10/10 FOR PRICE/PERFORMANCEwould recommend this phone to anyone who does not care if things are INSTANT. I think they used SLOW lpddr, paired with slow mmlc 64GB creating a unique bandwidth problem. The pages scroll much better after things are loaded. (I'm using the phone for texting, conference, and yep, phone calls all are instant with no lag whatsoever, same with home-screen/phone/settings navigation all really smooth)",
