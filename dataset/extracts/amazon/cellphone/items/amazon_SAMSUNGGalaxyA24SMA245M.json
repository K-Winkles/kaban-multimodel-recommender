Compared to the A14, the A24 has OLED display unlike the A14 for a nice vivid color screen, double storage at 128gb, faster processor and all around just a better phone for the similar price range. Was not marketed in the US due to it being 4G LTE to support international carriers so it does not have 5G however but if you don't travel much or live anywhere remote it's apsolutely fine and you'll never lose signal. I had this activated in store at Metro and it worked right away despite the employee having no idea what this phone was and saying it may not work due to it being a dual sim tray but it sure did. Tmobile and mint will also work. Imo this is the best budget Samsung Galaxy phone right now.In closing I'd recommend the two peice water proof case sold separately as phones in this price range are not waterproof and it adds a great feel and look to this phone. I normally don't leave reviews but this one deserved it, what a gem!",
