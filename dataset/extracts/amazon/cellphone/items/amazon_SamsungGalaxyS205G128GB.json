                "reviewText": "I received this S20+ 5G Renewed Phone from Stalion Requip, Shipped from Amazon. Arrived withAndroid 13 installed. Phone was well packed and came in a plain box with a nice 5Volt 2Amp (9Volt 1.87Amp) charger, USB C charging cable, and SIM Tray removal tool. The box was labeled NEW. The model I received is SM-G986U1. It is NEW, Pristine, Looks and Performs Flawlessly. The phone is Fully Unlocked for all US carriers GSM and CDMA. I put my SIM card and SD card in the dual SIM tray, powered up and in a short while I was up and running. I used the included Smart Switch app to transfer everything from my old Samsung phone. The phone is fast, color and graphics are great. WiFi and Bluetooth connect easily and work flawlessly. Phone connects quickly to Tracfone/Verizon mobile network and switches smoothly between LTE and 5G as I travel along. My Cell service is Tracfone through Verizon. The S20+ supports most of the LTE bands and 5G bands used by Verizon. This is important especially if you live or travel in a weak signal area with Verizon or other CDMA carrier. I don\u2019t know about GSM carriers. I first ordered the S20 FE, which, I found out, does not support the mmWave bands needed for the fastest 5G Verizon service or reliably connect to Verizon in my weak signal home location. As a result I couldn\u2019t get connected unless I walked outside my house into my driveway. Someone living in a strong signal area would not notice unless they travel into a weak signal area. This seems to be a problem with the design of the S20 FE and not the fault of the Renewer or Amazon. I wasn't willing to wait and try a replacement S20 Fe 5G so, unfortunately I had to send the S20 FE 5G back, I ordered the S20+ 5G instead. I'm very happy with my decision and with my S20+ 5G which supports 5G mmWave and reliably connects to Verizon in my weak signal area.I can\u2019t say enough good about Stalion Requip. All Renewers are not created equal. Stalion Requip includes a printout of all the internal specs and test results so you know what you're getting. Purchase your phone from Stalion Requip and you won\u2019t be disappointed.",

I did manage to drop the phone, cracking the case. Dropped on tile flooring - totally on me as I did not have an otterbox case on it. Still functions.I liked the recycle/spare on hand so much, I purchased a second phone as the sim card functions in both phones. Thanks, guys, y'all rock!PS Battery life not stellar but reading reviews of Samsung 20 Plus, it seems battery life is a common complaint.",

                "reviewText": "Since I refuse to spend $1000 on a new phone, here we are - using a 3 year old phone.That being said, this phone is exactly what I was hoping it would be. (although I mistakenly ordered an S20+ instead I'd the ultra)The condition was near flawless.There is a very slight amount of burn in which is not noticeable without an inspection app and not severe by any stretch.The phone is super snappy, has a fantastic display and battery life is fantastic as well.Buying it refurbished was a good move in my case.I wear Bluetooth hearing aids, so Bluetooth functionality was very important in my purchase.I can walk 30+ feet away from my phone with no loss of quality where my old phone might make it 10ft if lucky.Switching audio output between phone, truck Bluetooth and hearing aids is very easy and quicker than I was expecting.You are also able to specify which apps you'd like to default to BT or phone audio only. That's helpful as well.Even though it has some age to it, this phone easily out performs much newer phones and seems like it will hold up for me for years hopefully.",

                "reviewText": "Fast shipping - phone arrived in better than expected condition. It still had factory wrap in a couple of places. I took off one star for the fingerprint reader - it's not as dependable as my Motorola's physical reader on the side. Otherwise, the Samsung is 100% better at making/receiving calls and texts (my #1 goal in having a mobile phone). The Motorola's antenna was much weaker, and struggled to stay connected to Cricket's (AT&T) network . No complaints with my S20+. Also, the 5G and WiFi-6 are spoiling me. Battery life is great, charges fast. Takes great pictures and videos.",

U will break it with no case but despite it not being military grade it's sleek it's beautiful it's perfection internally whether it's the chipset, to the 12 GB of RAM, and the 4500 mah battery with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25everything is top spec. Plus to hold the phone as a 130 lbs it fits in hand prefect it's skinny n sleek n slippery so get a case cuz u don't wanna drop ur super computer phone. She has a aluminum chassis with gorrila glass 6 and is also waterproof up to 1 meter. Phone is so good I can stream outside on 5g like I'm in my house it's soo butter smooth and doesn't over heat at all unless u enter a sauna or volcano in that case get a phone cooler lol \ud83d\ude02",

Pero esto es de esperarse en un equipo que no es nuevo. Cualquier funda cubre ese detalle sin tema. Pero en verdad ni se nota.Lleg\u00f3 con cargador gen\u00e9rico, no es carga r\u00e1pida o por lo menos el tel\u00e9fono no lo reconoce como carga r\u00e1pida. Llega en cajita generica, pero todo muy bien protegido. Entrega super r\u00e1pida, Amazon no decepciona.En cuanto a funcionamiento llevo una semana de uso y nada falla. Gran pantalla, sensor de huella en pantalla funcionando, camara fotogr\u00e1fica excelente. El zoom es x30 e incre\u00edble. El tel\u00e9fono ya se actualizo a Android 13. La conectivad wifi6 es super r\u00e1pida y estable. La conectividad 5G a este precio es s\u00faper favorable, espero conservar este equipo varios a\u00f1os. Y tienes la posibilidad de agregar una tarjeta micro SD para almacenamiento externo. Tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 liberado para Mexico, sin problenas de redes. Y tiene la posibilidad de usar \"e-sim\". Gran tecnolog\u00eda a un gran precio. Gracias al proveedor !!!Update: Lamentablemente el lector de huella dactilar fallo despues de unas semanas de uso diario. Estoy aplicando el reembolso por devolucion. Es la primera vez que me falla algo \"renewed\", espero la garantia de Amazon pueda resolver este problema. En lineas generales, pensaria en volver a comprar este telefono. En verdad se disfruta mucho su uso.",
