Using apps from the cover screen is a battery saver and honestly very fun, feels like I'm using an MP3 when I switch songs or play around on it. I feel like this phone was made for people who either want the nostalgia of owning a flip phone again or just others who want to own one for the first time. I've done my research and this is currently one of the best flip phones you can own right now.",

                "reviewText": "Very cute phone and the glass is gorilla glass so it doesn't feel fragile. I've had it for a few months and it has survived a couple falls without a single scratch or crack (like it still looks brand new). The ability to fold also reminds me of a ds or gameboy which is good for the nostalgia feeling. The phone is also able to run games like Genshin Impact and rhythm tappers no problem with maxed settings and no lag at all. The back camera can also be used as a front camera which is great for better camera quality. Good upgrade from my old phone! Just note that it has NO headphone jack and NO sd card slot which is mildly annoying, but overall not a big deal. As a preorder bonus I actually got double the storage space, but even so, I'm nowhere near halway storage use so I wouldn't worry about lack of external storage for a long while.The battery itself takes awhile to fully charge, but it lasts a long time. With constant use and power saving mode turned off, the phone battery lasts me about 14 hrs.If you download Good Lock (samsung app) on the phone, you'll be able to do a lot more with it. For example, you can add more apps to the back screen along with be able to change app icons for more customisation.",

It has a lot of Great new features like when You are texting with Someone, You can see that They are responding by tapping on the upper left corner arrow of the text box and it will read, \"typing\".

For the money you spend to what you get in the device, its also the most bang for your buck device you can get! the new outer screen is also a big upgrade from previous models! Having the Flex window makes using the Flip device that much more enjoyable! Its also a reason to upgrade from previous Z flip models! If your considering upgrading or purchasing a flip device, the Z flip 5 is the way to go!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this phone for the compact nature. When folded, it fits nicely in your pocket. But, that's about the only good thing I can say about it. The phone lasted me just over 3 months. The crease on the inner main screen developed a blacked-out bar and the phone would no longer function. Within minutes, the entire screen started going black as well. It was too late for me to return the phone to Amazon, so I contacted Samsung. They made me go through their mail-in repair service (a process that can take 2 weeks). Samsung has the option to fix or send you a new phone. In my case, they sent me a new one. This meant that all my apps and data had to be reinstalled and reconfigured. But, I decided not to use the phone because the constant bending of the screen will undoubtedly cause failure again at some point. I like to keep my phones for at least 3-4 years, and this phone, with the screen being constantly bent, does not instill long-term confidence. Samsung's warranty only allows for free repair and/or replacement one time (during the first year of ownership only). I've used my \"one time\" and now I'm on my own if the screen goes bad again. Rather than go through the inconvenience of a broken screen again (and all the headache that caused me) I've decided not to use the phone anymore. I'll stick with my old non-folding phone for the time being. Moreover, the features that the phone offers aren't all that great anyway compared to similar pricey phones. It has an inferior camera (no zoom feature), a slower processor, and a limited functioning cover screen on the outside. Thus, I've taken a $1,099 total loss! That's a lot of money to throw away for 3 months of phone use. So, think twice before you decide to buy this phone.",
