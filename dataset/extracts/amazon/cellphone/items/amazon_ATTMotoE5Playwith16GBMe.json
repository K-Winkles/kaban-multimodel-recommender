I'd be the poorest of judges on how it would compare to other smartphones, but it would be the best compromise between a dumbphone and a A-spec smartphone. There is one thing I wish it had: file exploring via a PC. I've had to use Google Drive to download files I would like to have on it. But as far as local uploading and downloading to device from another device, I'm hardpressed to say it's there at all. Or maybe I haven't found out the trick behind it yet. However, with Internet functionality it may be a moot point. I would still give it 5/5.",
