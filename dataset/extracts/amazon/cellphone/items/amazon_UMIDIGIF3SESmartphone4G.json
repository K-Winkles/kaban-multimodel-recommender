The UMIDIGI F3 SE phone (which is 4G LTE) would not pick up / ring on an incoming calls while I am inside my home or nearby. A few miles away where the T-Mobile signal is stronger, the phone rings on incoming calls. Outgoing calls, in/out SMS, and WIFI work fine. When I transferred the SIM card to a 5G phone that I borrowed, the 5G phone picked up / rang on incoming calls hile I am inside my home or nearby. UMIDIGI sent me instructions to test and capture and share the log file. I did. UMIDIGI is investigating. I hope they will figure out the problem. In my specific case, a 5G phone seems to be the solution.",
