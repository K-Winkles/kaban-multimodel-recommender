                "reviewText": "I recently got my hands on the CUBOT X70, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in many ways. This unlocked Android smartphone is a powerhouse, offering a wide range of impressive features and specifications.Firstly, the 6.58\" HD display is simply stunning. It provides sharp and vibrant visuals, making it a joy to watch videos, play games, and browse through apps. The large screen size also enhances the overall viewing experience, making everything feel more immersive. The storage capacity of 24GB RAM and 256GB ROM is more than sufficient for all my needs. I have never had to worry about running out of space, and I can easily store my extensive photo collection, apps, and media files without any trouble. This is a huge plus for someone who loves taking photos and downloading new apps regularly. One of the standout features of the CUBOT X70 is its impressive camera setup. The 100MP main camera delivers exceptional image quality, allowing me to capture stunningly detailed photos in any lighting condition. Whether it's landscapes, portraits, or close-ups, this camera never disappoints. The 32MP front camera is equally impressive, bringing out the best in my selfies and ensuring clear video calls.Performance-wise, this phone shines with its 8-core processor. It effortlessly handles multitasking, allowing me to switch between apps seamlessly and run power-intensive tasks without any lag. I have not experienced any slowdowns or performance issues, even when using resource-intensive apps and games.Battery life is another area where the CUBOT X70 excels. The 5200mAh battery easily lasts me throughout the day, even with heavy usage. It also charges quickly, minimizing the time spent tethered to a power outlet. The phone's dual SIM support is a welcome feature, allowing me to use two different numbers or take advantage of different carrier plans. NFC capability adds convenience, enabling contactless payments with just a tap.Lastly, the fingerprint sensor on the CUBOT X70 provides an extra layer of security, ensuring that only I can access my phone's content. It works quickly and accurately, making unlocking the device a breeze.In conclusion, the CUBOT X70 is an impressive unlocked smartphone that offers a plethora of outstanding features. From its impressive camera capabilities, powerful performance, and generous storage capacity to the stunning display, long-lasting battery, and convenient features like dual SIM and NFC, this phone checks all the boxes.

                "reviewText": "All my Cubot phones in the past have had a removable battery. This one does not.This is a major design decision that impacts everything about whether or not I would ever want such a product. It is guaranteed to die, permanently, at some point in the next couple of years.And that's only the beginnings of the problems with a battery like this. It means I can't ever actually turn it off. Not really.Sorry, Cubot. You had a fan and an advocate with me until this. I recommended Cubot to my friends (who bought one) because of your phones' ability to remove & replace the battery. But you really dropped the ball here.So the battery life of this Cubot is much, much less than any phone that has a removable (and thus, replace-able) battery. In a couple of years, this phone will be dead, and un-repairable. It might be possible to take it to a shop but instead of a $15 battery, I'd have to pay as much as I would for a new phone to just keep this one working.And so, 1* for this one.",
