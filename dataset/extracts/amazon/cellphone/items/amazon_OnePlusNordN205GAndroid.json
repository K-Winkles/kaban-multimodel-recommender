Also, I hate being locked in contracts, so my current T-mobile plan is month to month basis and cheap!Pros: 5G, clear vivid screen, large display ( but not too large where your wrist gets tired holding it before bed while you read or browse social sites) , fast processing, no lagging, WiFi calling ( my house is in the bad reception area and now finally I get all calls through), call quality is superb, clear, pictures are fast and high quality, Amoled display and (!!!!!!!!!!!!!) 3.5 mm headphone jack!!!!Cons: none.I have downloaded about 18 different apps on my phone and all of them operate without any hiccups. So I am very upset my husband just got another brand for $$$ from best buy and wish he'd waited for this one. Overall: I am now official fan of ONE PLUS.",

                "reviewText": "First off I would like to say I am really enjoying this phone. The upgrade to Android 12 came with some great features that my old \"Android 12 Phone\" didn't have. The camera on this phone seems to get a bad rap in the reviews but it is prefectly adequate for day to day use. I'm not a professional and it certainly fills my needs and has a whole host of cool features you can toggle into and use. The display is crisp and the phone is fast and simply works well. The battery life is for every and will easily stand two days of use. I do not lock my phone so I can't comment on the \"facial recognition or finger print reader\". But the OS upgrade brought this great phone alive with some interesting features. The phone also has a magnetometer and accelerometer built in that I really love for a couple app's I like.The only criticisim I would have for the phone is the ring tones and notification tones could be much louder. But for music or video the volumn is fine. I had called OnePlus about this and they said that I could download louder ring tones and I did this and it did make a difference but this is the very first phone that I didn't have to modulate the ring tone and notification tones.But other then that tihs is a wonderful device.",

                "reviewText": "For a low to midrange phone, it's a great buy. Nice screen. Nice build quality. More than fast enough. Lots of storage. Audio ain't great. Not very loud on headphones. I know this depends on the headphones, but my free Samsung A-20 pushed my Sennheiser earbuds better. Find an EQ app to boost the volume. Streaming audio and video has always worked great. And downloaded video is perfect. Gotta love those Pug videos. And Free Clarence!Oxygen 12 OS is okay. What it does, it does well enough. Unfortunately, they won't update to OxygenOS 13, since it originally shipped under 11. So I guess my one update was done in the box. Settings menus are kind of a mess. I often have to go online to figure out how to make an adjustment. It took 15 minutes to find out how to change the image on my lock screen (it's under wallpapers, not home & lock screen, not security, not display). Can't comment on the UI, since I run a shell (Windows Metro, believe it or not), but it runs that without any problems or slowdown.Not so good is the fingerprint scanner. At least half the time I end up on the password screen. I've reset it a couple times and it doesn't get better. Really annoying is that it never actually closes any apps, and it has a bunch of apps it always opens, whether you want them to open or not. Especially Google apps, which they also won't let you delete or even \"park.\" So you'll need to download an app killer and run it regularly. Right now there are 35 open apps. About 5 of which I didn't use. That may be Android, but it's on their phone.Big plus is battery and charging. This thing is a beast. Two full days of power, even with Zoom meetings, texting, and browsing. Recharges in minutes, not hours. About 75% in less than an hour. Maybe 90 for a full charge. I almost wish it wasn't so nicely built and good looking. I don't dare risk not using a gel case, in case I might hurt it!I had to torture myself to spend $230 on this - and I'm glad I did. If I were willing to spend $900+ on a phone, I'd buy a OnePlus in a minute. I'm not, but if OnePlus would like me to review their latest model...",

This phone has everything that I was looking for: excellent face recognition, a reliable fingerprint reader, a high-quality camera, and a stunning screen. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a new device.First and foremost, the face recognition technology on this phone is top-notch. It is incredibly accurate and fast, making it easy to unlock my phone with just a quick glance. I never have to worry about typing in a password or fumbling with my fingers to unlock my phone.The screen on this phone is crazy good for the price. It has a large, high-resolution display that is perfect for gaming and videos. The colors are vibrant and the screen is incredibly responsive to touch.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend this Android phone to anyone looking for a device with excellent face recognition, a reliable fingerprint reader, a high-quality camera, and a stunning screen.",
