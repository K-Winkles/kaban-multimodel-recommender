Prior to purchasing I did my research and reviewed many comments on both the product and seller. The product like all Verizon branded smartphones comes unlocked the trick which many blackberry users already now is switching the band from CDMA to using the SIM, once all configurations are done and the sim installed this unit is by far one of the best blackberry phones available. It is snappy, responsive and the battery life is excellent, In regards to the seller, the product was as advertised, it arrived well protected and if the opportunity arises I will buy from the seller again. In conclusion the phone for the offering price is a great deal and will never cease to impress like all blackberry phones",
