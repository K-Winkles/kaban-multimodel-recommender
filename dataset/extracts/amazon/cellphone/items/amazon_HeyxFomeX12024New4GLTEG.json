                "reviewText": "This phone is an android. It is VERY user friendly. I originally bought it because it was cost feasible. It's a first time phone for my 11 year old. She loves it! The screen size is awesome! It is super user friendly. It came unlocked so we can use on any network. Also when I ordered it I didn't realize it came with a clear case and screen protector so that was an added unexpected bonus.",
