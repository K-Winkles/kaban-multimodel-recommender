                "reviewText": "This is my main phone. I've now had it for over a month. As you read on you'll see my impressions after 2 weeks. I just want to add, I am thrilled with this phone after over a month and lots of use. Battery is great, not two days, but a whole day. Everything about it very good. Of course, I don't know about longevity, but if this phone continues for a year or so as it is now it will above 5 stars to me. I've had this about 2 weeks. I tried 2 other phones and returned them without any hassle. Thank you Amazon. But this phone was under $200 and I'm very happy with it. The 6 gb ram is very efficient and the 256 gb storage is more than enough plus I get to keep photos and docs on an SD card. I don't play games beyond solitaire and gin rummy so a super phone with high end specs for sophisticated games is obviously not a priority. I read a lot so I'll have a book, dictionary, Wikipedia, email, and text open at same time and there is no lag when switching between apps. Photos are fine for me. Not and expert photographer so was not looking for phone to double as top of line camera. But photos are excellent for my standards. Screen is bright and clear. It has good receiver for phone calls, I'm on Tello. Calls are clear and not one drop so far. I have another phone other than Motorola that drops calls. I contribute the drops to the receiver unit in the phone. I have two Motorola cells and both have good receiver capabilities. Wifi is both 5g and 2.4g and again, great speedy connection. I use ATT wifi. I also use the phone to keep track of my steps. That's important to me. It is very accurate if that's a priority to you. Also it connects to my Samsung Galaxy Watch with no problems. The 6.5 inch screen is a perfect size for me. My only wish is that it were a bit lighter, but not as heavy as the Moto G stylus I also have. Overall, if you're looking for an above average phone with good battery life and under or near $200 I would recommend the Moto G 5g.",

                "reviewText": "My Moto E4+ running Android 7.1 worked fine, but too many critical apps (banking, travel) dropped support for 7.1 so I went looking for an upgrade. I wanted something that would work with T-Mobile LTE band 71 and this phone supports it. 5G is a plus as well.Activation was literally as easy as swapping my current SIM and turning it on. I was able to transfer most apps and data from my E4+ with the underlying Android tools, although at least one MFA token app did not transfer my latest updates. (That's an Android issue, not a problem with the phone.)Android 12 took a little getting used to, but it's the same basic idea. Battery life is just as good as my E4+, and is a primary reason I stick with these Moto phones. Reception is similar.This phone has more Moto branding and what might be a little more bloatware than my E4+, but it's not obtrusive and I haven't felt any need to disable it. It's NOTHING like the bloatware you get on a Samsung device.The phone reports \"5G\" and \"5G+\" in the status bar when in fact it is not connecting to 5G bands, but 4G bands. This is a known marketing bodge by T-Mobile (and other carriers, AT&T is the worst). But Lenovo lists the actual 5G radio bands in this phone's specs, so I feel future proofed. If you're curious about that, install the SignalSpy app and check your local bands.I'm using the Red Pocket MVNO and SIMs to access T-Mobile's network and this phone works perfectly.As long as Lenovo makes these great unlocked Moto phones, I'll keep using them. Oh, and it's priced very reasonably, too.",
