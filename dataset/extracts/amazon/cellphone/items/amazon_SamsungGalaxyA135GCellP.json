Not certain if it is poor design by Samsung or was not refurbished prior to sale, but power button was buggy on day one and completely stopped working within 4 days.

                "reviewText": "I purchased the phone because I broke mine and it was $100.00 more from Spectrum, who uses Verizon networks, therefore after trying for two hours to get the phone going I could not because my broke phone is from Verizon. After several attempts, even though the phone is unlocked, neither I nor customer service could transfer my old device to this new one. I did have a happy outcome however, Spectrum deducted the price I paid for this phone and allowed me to purchase one of their phones for an additional $90. So if you have a phone from Amazon or Spectrum Mobile this phone will not work.",
