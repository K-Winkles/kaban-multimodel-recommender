        "description": "Meet Pixel 4a with 5G, the essential Google phone. It has the helpful stuff you need in a cell phone, with an extra boost of 5G speed. So you can download a movie in seconds, enjoy smooth streaming, and play your favorite games. Pixel 4a with 5G also takes amazing ultrawide photos in any light, keeps your data safe, blocks robocalls, and has an all-day battery that can last up to 48 hours with Extreme Battery Saver. It\u2019s a lot of help from Google, for a lot less than you\u2019d expect. And it\u2019s an unlocked smartphone, so you can choose the data plan and carrier that work for you. [1] Works with all major carriers. Contact carrier for details. 5G service is carrier dependent. [2] Requires a 5G data plan (sold separately). 5G service and roaming not available on all carrier networks or in all areas. Contact carrier for details about current 5G network performance, compatibility, and availability. Phone connects to 5G networks, but 5G service, speed, and performance depend on many factors including, but not limited to, carrier network capabilities, device configuration and capabilities, network traffic, location, signal strength, and signal obstruction. Actual results may vary. Some features not available in all areas. Data rates may apply. [3] Download speed claims based on testing videos from three streaming platforms. Average download time was less than sixty seconds. File sizes varied between 449MB and 1.3GB. Download speed depends upon many factors, such as file size, content provider and network connection. Testing conducted in an internal 5G network lab and on pre-production hardware in California in July/August 2020. Actual download speeds may be slower. [4] Enabling gameplay with cellular data may increase your mobile data usage up to 2.7GB/hr. Gameplay is service-, network-, connection-, and game-dependent, and may not be available for all games in all areas. Users may experience inconsistent gameplay. Stadia requires account creation. [5] Hotspot capability subject to carrier plan. [6] For \u201cAll day\u201d: Maximum battery life based on testing using a mix of talk, data, standby, and use of other features. Testing conducted on two major carrier networks using Sub-6 GHz non-standalone 5G (ENDC) connectivity. For \u201cUp to 48 hours\u201d: Maximum battery life based on testing using a mix of talk, data, standby, and use of limited other features that are default in Extreme Battery Saver mode (which disables various features including 5G connectivity). Testing conducted on two major carrier networks. For both claims: Pixel 4a (5G) and Pixel 5 battery testing conducted by a third party in California in mid 2020 on pre-production hardware and software using default settings, except that, for the \u201cup to 48 hour claim\u201d only, Extreme Battery Saver mode was enabled. Battery life depends upon many factors and usage of certain features will decrease battery life. Actual battery life may be lower. [7] Android version updates for at least 3 years from when the device first became available on the Google Store in the US. [8] US only. English only. Call Screen may not detect all spam calls. [9] Screen sharing not available on group calls. Requires Wi-Fi or 5G internet connection. Not available on all apps and content. Data rates may apply. 5G service, speed and performance depend on many factors including, but not limited to, carrier network capabilities, device configuration and capabilities, network traffic, location, signal strength, and signal obstruction. [10] Some third-party apps and data may not be transferred automatically. [11] Subscriptions may be required. [12] Compared to MSRP of unlocked Pixel 5 phone on the Google Store in the US. Requires a 5G data plan (sold separately). 5G service and roaming not available on all carrier networks or in all areas. Contact carrier for details about current 5G network performance, compatibility, and availability. Phone connects to 5G networks, but 5G service, speed, and performance depend on many factors including, but not limited to, carrier network capabilities, device configuration and capabilities, network traffic, location, signal strength, and signal obstruction. Actual results may vary. Some features not available in all areas. Data rates may apply.[13] Not available for all apps and content. Display automatically adjusts to optimize for best viewing and battery performance. [14] Qualcomm Snapdragon is a product of Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. and/or its subsidiaries. Qualcomm and Snapdragon are trademarks of Qualcomm Incorporated, registered in the United States and other countries. [16] Storage specifications refer to capacity before formatting. Actual formatted capacity will be less. [17] Qi-compatible. Wireless charger sold separately. [18] Up to 18W wired charging rates are based upon use of the included charger plugged into a wall outlet. Actual results may be slower. [19] Charging rates are based upon use of the included charger plugged into a wall outlet. Actual results may vary. [20] Designed to charge Qi-certified devices. Use of Battery Share significantly reduces Pixel battery life. Cases may interfere with charging and will reduce charging speed.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a replacement for my Samsung Galaxy s4 I bought in 2014. The Samsung phone still worked but with Android 5 most apps would not run on it. Also I was getting so many spam calls here in Las Vegas that it was driving me crazy.First priority I wanted a phone that would screen calls for me. None of the call blocker apps worked well enough for me and I did not want to pay extra charges for some premium app. When I heard that Google had a built in call screener, I decided I had to get a Pixel phone.Next I wanted a phone that would stay current with software updates as long as possible because I intend to keep it forever. Google guarantees three years worth of updates which is the longest I could find. So I had to get Pixel phone.Finally I wanted a phone with a big enough screen that i could read it easily as I am over 70 and my eyes aren't what they used to be. This is why I picked the Pixel 4a with 5G instead of the Pixel 4a.I didn't care about waterproofing or wireless charging, etc. because the phone was going into a case with a glass cover for protection.I got my phone from Amazon in early December after waiting for Prime day and Black Friday and being disappointed that there were no discounts. If I had waited a bit longer i could have gotten $50 off, but that's life.I've had the phone now for around three months and it works well. I LOVE the call screener, It comes with Android 11 and should be good at least through Android 14. The size is just right and it is much faster than my old S4 and runs all the apps I will ever use.I don't make many calls so one charge lasts almost 4 days. It charges completely from almost zero to 100% in about an hour and a half - much faster than my S4.The only weak point is that occasionally the fingerprint reader takes several tries to work.I signed up with T-Mobile on their $15/mo plan and the connections I get around Vegas are superb. Often I get a 5G connection and I have yet to have a dropped call. I rarely use data outside my home so 2GB/mo is plenty for my use. I rarely use the camera. I have heard it is great. But I'll probably never know.Bottom line is I am very happy with this phone. I expect to keep it for many, many years.",

                "reviewText": "I upgrade from a Samsung S6, so this was a major upgrade. Battery life is great. I can make it through a whole day without needing a charge, which is much different than my old phone. Charger quickly too.Picture wise it's a big upgrade to, night and dark photos are really great and daylight or highlight photos have a level of clarity and depth that I didn't expect. Although I'm certainly no photo expert.. I would say the photo quality particularly the night time photos are a major step up if ur phone is from a few years ago or simply a cheaper model.Coming from a Samsung, the absence of bloatware was a major attraction to this phone. My only issue was lack of a back button which is easily fixable in the seeing menu under accessibility.Processor and speed wise.. I'm to understand this isn't the latest processor but I don't really game so it's plenty responsive to me.This is a usb c charger.. I like the larger charger port as it seems more substantial, however didn't like having to buy a bunch of new cords to replace the micro usb. Lack of wireless charger (I believe, never tried it myself) is a bit of a bummer.Price wise.. I'm satisfied and although I've never used one.. it's hard to imagine justifying paying double or more of the price of this phone for the latest and greatest model.",

                "reviewText": "First of all, I had the phone 4 days and I'm still putting it though it's paces. The first thing I noticed right away after downloading everything is the battery life.The battery life is incredible on this phone...wow. I had it a few days now and I got, 10hrs 28min on screen time over 2 1/2 day's with time left to spare. I didn't make it to battery saver mode. This is with a mix of heavy, med to light use. It charges pretty quickly also. It took 1hr and 5mins to charge from 17% to 100%.Love the camera and this is one of the reasons why people buy this phone. And the extra Google features they put on this phone. And the timely upsides of course.I was surprised to find out that I had 5g. It's pretty quick, T-Mobile version with me on Mint. I'm getting 40mbs to 162 dn to 15.9 to 57 up in areas I've tested so far. My friend is getting 7.4 dn where he lives so, everywheres different but so far I've been getting it everywhere I go.It's a nice simple phone and it's the Goldilocks of the new Pixel phones. No issues so far, works great.One I thing I don't like is, the location of the power button on top coming from Moto phones. Other than that love the phone.",

                "reviewText": "The phone is solid, it does everything I would expect, it replaced my Pixel XL and for the most part I am happy with the phone. However, in my research last night I found that unless you are on Verizon and get the Verizon Pixel 4a 5G you will not have access to what most would consider true 5g, which is is anything in the 6ghz spectrum and above at the time of this writing.The 5G you will get on carriers other than Verizon is called Sub-6GHZ, and while speeds and coverage are better, it seems like the industry is boasting of it's mmWave service in their advertising and I think this is what most are expecting when they here 5g.Does this matter much today? No, most people don't get a mmWave signal, I had to call ATT to find the nearest one to me and it is over 1500 feet away, which is the about how far an mmWave signal can reach, assuming no obstructions. In most cases it won't reach that far given the obstructions it will have to pass through.This is not meant to cast a negative light on the phone, just to give realistic expectation if you get one.",

                "reviewText": "I've been impressed with the Pixel series of phones which is why I bought this one, no regrets. The price/performance ratio makes them a great choice. I love the fact that you get stock Android without all the bloatware other manufacturers install on their phones, and you get Android updates quickly.The battery can last over 48 hours depending on use, but even with heavy use it lasts the whole day, the camera takes great pictures, and 5G is fast. My old Pixel 3 XL (4G LTE) gave me about 80 mbits/sec download, this phone gives me over 500 mbits/sec download.Size wise it's right in that sweet spot, it's a touch smaller than my Pixel 3 XL but not by much. I debated getting a Pixel 5 but it's a little too small, and for some reason there is no Pixel 5 XL, in a way you can think of the Pixel 4a(5G) as the Pixel5 XL. I find the fingerprint scanner on the back is perfectly positioned for my hand size, and the case (Spigen Tough Armor) I bought guides my finger directly to it so I can quickly unlock my phone.There are a few areas they could have improved on, I wish it had Gorilla Glass 6 and a 90HZ refresh rate like the Pixel 5 but in reality it doesn't really matter that much, the touch screen works fine and animations are smooth. It also lacks water resistance, but if you don't use it in the rain/snow and take care of it you'll be fine. The 128GB storage size is adequate for me but there are probably people who could use more.It's the best phone I've had and I definitely recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "So i bought this in August,2022.The camera is great as you can expect from a pixel device. The night mode is also good. the ultra wide is not exactly ultra wide as you see on other phones but it does take some good ultra wide photos and you also get the unlimited backup on this pixel. This feature is not available for pixel 5 and above devices. So this pixel 4a 5g is the last device to have this.The battery is okish, it can get you through the day. I use this as a secondary device so I can get easily 2 days with it.The display is very good but if you come from using a QuadHD+ display then you might notice some subtle difference. the touch responsiveness is also very good. Always on display is nice to have.It comes with 5g so its future proof. I got this shipped with android 11 but got the update for android 13 right after I turned it on.( android 13 launched just a few days ago). In terms of latest updates you will get all latest updates ahead of any other manufacturer.The ram management is okish but it can suffice daily usage requirements. This phone is not for high performance. I am yet to install pubg on this and test it on that angle.the phone comes with a 18W type charger and cable included but the pin is not the indian pin, it is the standard western pin. but its good to see a charging brick in the box these days. the charging speed is not damn good, its okish. It takes 1.5hrs something to charge to 100%I would recommend you to not update the software on this phone and go with the software it comes out of the box. The more you update, the sh*ttier the phone gets later on (speaking from personal experience from android phones).After 3 months :So I\u2019ve updated the phone and it is working really good(that is something I\u2019ve never expected from an android). The charging time is too much if you use it moderately.Multi tasking is a nightmare and this phone can\u2019t handle heavy gaming as well. I tried pubg in lowest settings and high frame rate. It lags but it can manage. I am looking to buy a more watt power brick for this may be a 65W brick as I\u2019m not used to wait for so long to charge the phone. I used one plus and iPhones before so they charge so much faster and this charges so slow even with 18W charger.",
