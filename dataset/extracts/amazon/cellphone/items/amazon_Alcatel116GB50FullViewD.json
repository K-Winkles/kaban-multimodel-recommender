BUT, it's exactly what I needed as a second \"go phone\" rather than my main line. AND it is an unlocked smart phone that really is unlocked and accommodates a reseller network (Consumer Cellular). Setup was a snap: inserted my new SIM and logged in with my Google account. The phone and Consumer Cellular did the rest including importing my contacts. I just had to disable a few pre-installed, and a couple of must haves out of Google Play, and done. As George Carlin would say, a smaller portable place for my stuff. If you're looking for frills, not your phone. But it's great for basic utility.",

                "reviewText": "This Alcatel 1 phone does just what I needed - a phone to use with Tracfone on the T-Mobile network. I just followed the on-screen prompts to set it up and transfer my directory from the old phone, which had a non-replaceable battery that swelled and pushed out the phone's glass display screen. I gave this phone 5 stars for battery life because the battery is replaceable. I like that feature, along with the relatively compact size. Sound quality is good. An excellent phone at a very good price.",

                "reviewText": "There is no damn reason on earth you should get this over a used iPhone 6 or Samsung Galaxy S8 for the same price.There is no advantage to getting a new crappy phone compared to a used good one. Get a flagship smartphone that's 5 or 6 years old.It still has 4G service, it's still around $50 used.It will actually take photos that don't look like they were taken by a Motorola flip phone from 2006.It won't crash on you more than 5 times by just sending a simple text message from the SMS app, yes that has actually been my experience with my brief few days so far with this phone.It won't take several seconds just to view a photo someone texted you.They will have a headphone jack just like this does.You aren't even getting longer software longevity with this phone, because it too was released around 5 years ago.I am on a budget too, I understand not everyone can afford an expensive phone and I understand some people are hesitant about buying used phones or old phones. But this is an old phone. And it's a terrible old phone. And I've hated every minute so far of trying to text or watch YouTube videos on it and having it crash on me left and right.There is no damn reason on earth you should get this over a used iPhone 6 or Samsung Galaxy S8 for the same price.",
