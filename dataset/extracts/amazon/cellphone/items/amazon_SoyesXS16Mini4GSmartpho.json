Regarding finger printing and face recognition, I am not sure these features exist and if they do, there are no prompts or instructions to direct their set up. Please provide with such as I think both features are quite important. Overall, the Soyes XP 12 Pro is an amazingly powerful smart phone, innovative, convenient and I can go on.Thanks to developers and distributors!!",

                "reviewText": "This is a good second phone for monitoring other sims you may have. Manual was not very clear on how to install 2 SIM cards, so I struggled. Eventually figured out you must use 1 microsim plus 1 nanosim. The holding tray for the sims needs the microsim placed on one side with the cut-off corner nicely matched - I had to trim the microsim slightly to get it to fit in. On the opposite side of the sim tray you must place the nano sim at 90 degrees to the first and place it in the middle of the tray. Both sims must have the golden contacts facing out (not at each other, of course). Then I managed to slide the tray in and both sims were read. Not having seen such an arrangement before and not finding a single video on it on Youtube, it took a while to work out. My only other comment concerns the screen. Quite hard to type as accuracy of the keys is a bit off. I ended up having to use a stylus, which did work better. So far so good. As I will only be using it to receive sms, it looks like it will be a good little unit.",

                "reviewText": "[See edits at the bottom]First, let's get the bad out:\u2022 The network flip flops between 4g and 3g. I asked the seller/manufacturer, and they replied it's the RAM, that some batches got upgraded from 3 GB to 4GB. Deceptive answer, since it is NOT the RAM. But a Google search tells me that the switching networks may or may not be the device's fault.\u2022 The battery doesn't last. Drains very quickly. Fortunately for me, I use my cell phone very little, which is why a tiny device like this works for me. Still, it's annoying to have to charge it daily (my original Nokia 2720 could go for days without charging\u2014I loved that phone, had it for 10 years). And this will be more annoying when traveling.\u2022 The power on jingle... SO annoying! I may need to power on my phone in a quiet setting! That was one thing I hated about the \"new\" version of my beloved Nokia 2720 (didn't keep that one too long).Now, to the good!\u2022 Size is perfect! This is my only personal cell phone (I have a phablet for work). I hate modern phones, too small to do anything comfortably and too big to carry (I refuse to be physically tethered to a big phone). I only need a cell phone for the bare basics when I'm outside, it needs to fit in my wallet, and this fits the bill. I first purchased the UniHertz Jelly 2. That is a fantastic mini phone. Unfortunately, too thick for my wallet.\u2022. I was lucky to get one from the new batches, with 4GB of RAM and Android 10!\u2022 I can do everything I need: calls on my personal cell number and on my business phone app (even a second SIM if I wanted!), text, email (so I don't miss client messages when I'm out), and Google if I really need to look something up.Overall, very satisfied. Hope they never stop making tiny phones.Edit 14 May: I travelled to the US (I am based in Canada) and I couldn't get this phone to work! My carrier notified me that I was roaming, but I couldn't get this phone to connect to a US network. Luckily, I had my phablet, but this was a major disappointment! Will try on my next trip hoping this was just a bad day or something.Edit May 28: Turns out that T-Mobile (the US carrier my Canadian SIM switches to) doesn't support this device. I thought that it would, since one of its frequencies is listed in the product description. But no. I learned about IMEI compatibility the hard way.While I was willing to put up with limited battery power for the sake of size, the inability to use my phone in the US is a major deal breaker. Downgraded from 4 to 2 stars. Wish I could sell it. It was expensive.Back to my Unihertz Jelly. Its thickness is a small price to pay now.",
