Will buy another one he liked it so much he wants 2. Directions were awful. They just did not make sense. Maybe add pictures for those of us without an MIT degree lol. Had to watch a tutorial on UTube after that it took us 10 minutes to put it together. We both lack in the mechanically inclined department. SMH. We love it and ordering another.",

It was super easy to assemble even though it came with no true instructions. It said to refer back to Amazon for a video but I couldn\u2019t locate it so I winged it. Turned out great. Now we need a second one! I will say the controller is trash. You have to push so hard on the buttons and sometimes even then they don\u2019t want to work. It is very very cheap. Hence the 4/5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "I bought one of these lamps on sale in September 2023\u2026 I ended up liking it so much that I ordered another in October 2023. Assembly is required, however, I found it fairly easy to put together. The directions are simple to follow. I downloaded the app and paired them to my phone with ease. I spent a solid day just playing around with all of the fun features and different light settings. The possibilities are absolutely endless. I even set an automation to turn on/off during certain times of the day/night. I normally have it on a warm light but when I have guests over, I set it on the music feature where the lights bump to the beat of the music which guests always love; So much so, that I\u2019ve sent them the link and they\u2019ve ordered the lamps themselves \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffdPlease note that it is more of an AMBIENT light! One con is that the fist lamp I bought in September 2023 has trouble connecting to my phone sometimes so I have to un/re-plug which is a little annoying. Other than that, I am very satisfied with this product!",

However, I kept it because I like the added design and feel it gave the room overall. I can change it to represent how I'm feeling or my mood. Full transparency though, it's purple 90% of the time. Was really easy to hook up to Alexa and she can change it to any color easily just by telling her. You can even have her turn it on and off at a moments notice.",
