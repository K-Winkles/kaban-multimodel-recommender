                "reviewText": "I was amazed at how quickly I got this torchier (lamp)! My last one (LED) was great, lasted many years and the base just crumbled out of the blue (it looks like the plastic base encased some relatively cheap plaster or cement). I threw that out, went to Amazon and saw this that was decently reviewed as seemed reasonably priced. When it arrived, I unpacked it from the box and had it up and running in about 20 minutes (I took my time deliberately to make sure I screwed on sections of the pole without being crooked), attached the plastic dome and switched it on. I do like the warm white light that the product says the color temperature ranges from 2700K - 3000K. Perfect for my living room. I am a bit skeptical about the bulb as it seems proprietary and make be difficult to get. The manufacturer could have built this lamp to use a standard LED bulb and allow the customer to decide that they want it in the WARM/BRIGHT or DAYLIGHT flavor or choose a higher wattage bulb for additional brightness if needed. What happens if the bulb burns out?If the area you are putting this lamp is on the larger side (say about 250 SF upwards) and you have it in the corner, it may be a little difficult to read a book (or the instructions that come with this lamp!).*Word of note: The turn switch is close to the dome so if you have this set back and there is a sofa, small table or chair between the lamp and a wall, if you are 'height challenged' you may have to tip toe to be able to reach it. It would have been better if the switch was in the middle of the pole (I understand the design of the slim pole may be hindering putting it mid pole). I also hope that the turn switch will last (it does seem a tad flimsy).Overall and thus far, it is quite a \"good bang for the buck\" lamp. Simple in design and addresses my simple needs of warm light in the living room.",

That being said, they are all pretty similar but have different features. This one is the simplest with one light setting that can me made bright or dim using the mounted pressure pad. The issue with the one I received is the cable that attaches to the lamp head was too long and difficult to get back into the tube. I almost sent it back. I managed to get it to fit and it is working fine. The other downside: If you plug the lamp into an outlet with a wall switch, it will not turn the lamp on. It can only be turned on from the switch mounted to the lamp. This is inconvenient but given the sale price, I can deal with it",
