                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Here\u2019s the real reason this is such a clever and useful product\u2026",
                "reviewText": "This is a wonderful multi-functional product at a very reasonable price. This great product is difficult to describe in just a few statements. Obviously it is categorized on Amazon as a floor lamp, but what it really is a useful space creator. For me, it frees up valuable kitchen counter space that I had been using as a battery charging center, and lets me create a freestanding charging station in the unobtrusive guise of a useful, well designed floor lamp.Yes, this is an excellent self-standing floor lamp, but the real reason it is so useful is how it frees up the limited kitchen counter space I was wasting as a messy battery charging center. If you are like me and my friends, you probably are taking up space in your kitchen (as shown it the first photo I have uploaded) where you have bunch of charging adapters plugged in there because a kitchen counter is where you can easily access the power outlets. Or maybe like another good friend of mine, you have them plugged into wall outlets near the floor or in power strips creating a jumble of wires. In any case, I never realized what a poor use of space that was until I bought this unit which has a beautifully integrated charging station. Not only is it cleverly designed as a combination charging station and floor lamp, but it\u2019s also well-constructed. I\u2019m going to comment on the design, manufacturing, packaging, and overall value of this product which are all excellent.There are almost too many features included in this product to mention in a short review, but each one is an indication of how carefully this product has been designed, manufactured, and packaged to be sold at a price point that makes it such a great value. For example, it includes extra fasteners of each type needed so that you will never need to return this product because you accidentally misplaced one of the screws\u2014admit it, how many times have you come up short only to \u201cdiscover\u201d the missing screw when you vacuum the carpet? All the tools needed to assemble it are provided, even the screwdriver (see uploaded photo). The assembly instructions are broken down into a sequence of well-illustrated and easily understandable steps. Included are high-friction self-sticking EVA cushion strips that are applied to the bottom of the lamp both to help keep it from slipping on hard floors, but also to help keep it from scratching your floor. It includes snap on wire clamps to hide and guide the power cord down the floor along one of the back supports. And the cord is long enough that no matter where you put it in your home, you will almost surely will be able to plug it in without needing an extension cord. These are little things that many manufacturers eliminate to cut corners and make it cheaper while ignoring the practical frustrations of their customers. This manufacturer has decided to include many extras to make the product and experience one of quality at a reasonable cost.It arrives in a sturdy, well cushioned compact carton (see uploaded photo). It is heavy corrugated cardboard with an extra layer on the bottom, carefully compartmentalized so that the parts don\u2019t damage each other in shipping. The groups of parts are individually bagged, and several items are double boxed for protection.I\u2019m a retired product manager, so I really admire the choices this manufacturer has made to provide a product of superior design at an affordable price. There are so many important aspects to this product that I\u2019m just going to list a number of them that most customers might overlook. The wooden parts are precision cut and drilled, with many of the holes countersunk to make the heads of the screws flush with the surface. The support poles are connected with threaded metal fasteners and screw into threaded metal inserts as shown in an uploaded photo. This is so important because these connections are subject to a lot of force, and if cheaper wood screws were used, they would eventually work lose. Again, this is an indication of a higher quality product that is carefully engineered to last longer than cheaper alternatives. The lamp shade is made of a thick material that diffuses the light effectively without creating a small hotspot. It is cleverly constructed to fold flat for shipping, but assembles with heavy Velcro strips that hold all the edges firmly in place. The connector between the outlet box and the lamp holder safely screws together. There are two Type-A USB charging receptacles that provide 2 amps of 5 volt charging current. There is also a line voltage receptacle in which I have plugged a Type-C USB power adapter. A hidden drawer-stop keeps the drawer from accidentally being pulled out so far that it falls on the floor spilling its contents. The shelves are sturdy and conveniently create extra storage or display space, something in short supply in most homes.The three-temperature (color) bulb provided is yet another example of how this manufacture has not skimped when it would be so easy to do so. This turned out to be an unexpected benefit for me. At first I thought that this type of bulb was meant to accommodate personal preferences\u2014many people prefer the red colored light that is similar to conventional incandescent bulbs, but I like the bluer daylight type light most of the time. But here is the secret advantage of having a choice\u2014successive tugs on the pull switch chain changes the color from warm to bright and back again: during the day or for reading, the daylight color adds good illumination, but at night, the warm color creates a cozy ambient atmosphere.Perhaps the best aspect of this product is the one that is least noticed\u2014how disguised as a conventional floor lamp, this mobile charging station unobtrusively blends into the background of my living space.",

                "reviewText": "This lamp is the BEST. It\u2019s every bit worth the money. I bought it because I hate overhead lighting with a passion. Long story short, I\u2019ve been literally toting this lamp around the house with me because I love it \ud83d\ude02 So I bought two more which should be arriving tomorrow. Two for either side or our bed to act as our charging stations and a place for our water bottles and other usual nightstand fare. And to light the room as I work from home during the day in here. And one for the living room. My husband weakly protested, but he loves it too. He keeps thanking me for ordering it lol.I bought the Philips dimmable multicolor smart bulb to put in it, which is controllable via the Wiz app on my iPhone. I can make it any color, I can make it a nightlight, and I can make it come on at a pre-scheduled time (like make a dim light come on at wake-up time to help shake off the sleep).The lamp alone is beyond worth the money. But I do highly recommend using with the philip smart bulb. It\u2019s just a remarkable combo. I\u2019m just upset I didn\u2019t buy this lamp and the bulbs a long time ago. It\u2019s sturdy, sleek-looking, and HIGHLY functional. Takes up way less room than a nightstand, and the charging ports are the icing on the cake. It\u2019s especially awesome in a small greater-NYC apartment like we have. Multi-functional and space saving. Great light in a small space that can easily change the mood and feel of an area with an otherwise closed-in, static feel. Especially if you use it with your own full-spectrum dimmable bulb.I love to put my iPad on the shelf while it charges, and it functions as a great alarm. Using shortcuts I can make it play a podcast or something at the same time my lamp is scheduled to come on in the morning.I\u2019ll try to remember to update with more and better pictures. But just trust me and other reviewers\u2014 you will not regret this lamp purchase. I\u2019ve wasted a fair bit of money on bad amazon purchases, but THIS was a huge win.Also, assembly was straightforward. No complaints.BUY IT! YOU\u2019LL LOVE IT!",

It took me and my husband 30-45 minutes to put together on our own and it really made our room look so much more put together. It comes with the lightbulb which has different lighting modes and all the screws/pieces. The directions were so easy to follow. I love how tall the lamp is, Our bed isn\u2019t that high off the ground so they definitely tower a little over our bed. Perfect for someone who has a really tall bed. I\u2019m 6\u20190 and it almost as tall as me. Great buy , great purchase. Definitely worth it!",

If you want to get fancy, you can plug christmas lights into them, click off the main light and set a timer on the smart plug to turn on and off at set times. A lot you can do with these and they feel like they will last a while.",

It\u2019s pretty sturdy considering my german shepherd knocked it over when barking out the window and it\u2019s still going strong haha. It looks classy and I love it! I\u2019d buy another in the future for sure. Worth the investment in my books.",
