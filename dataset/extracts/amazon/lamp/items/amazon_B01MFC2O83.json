It\u2019s not difficult and there is nothing wrong with the lamp or the instructions \u2014 you just have to fully screw it together and the people reporting problems in their reviews probably are experiencing the same issue my teenager did: I ordered this for my college freshman daughter. She reported (like many of the reviewers here) that the stem was weak and couldn\u2019t be threaded together properly so the lamp wouldn\u2019t stand up and was wobbly when she screwed it together. I thoughtMaybe she\u2019d stripped the threads so I mailed her some plumbers tape to try on the threads but it made no difference. When we went to pick her up at college she had shoved the lamp into a closet saying it was \u201cmessed up\u201d and not usable. Her dad and I took a look (thinking it was on its way to the trash) and immediately saw she hadn\u2019t assembled it properly. The threads in the stem must be screwed in fully to each piece (as far as they can be screwed in, until they can\u2019t go any further) and then the whole thing goes together beautifully \u2014 it took us less than two minutes to fix the problem. It was simply a rookie mistake that my daughter didn\u2019t realize that the threads needed to be fully in each piece before the next piece was connected. Lamp is now put together and a great addition to her room.",

                "reviewText": "Not gonna lie, I was a little hesitant about ordering this lamp just based off the reviews but figured for the price what the heck give a try. If there's any issues just return it not a big deal.(Pros) It seems good for now. Assembly was very easy had it done in about 2-3 minutes. However, I could see why people were struggling when it comes to assembling the poles and the wire. You have to pull the wire at the bottom of the base each time a new pole is put in this way there's no slack. They don't tell you that in the instructions (READ THOSE VERY CAREFULLY) which is fine very straight forward. Plastic shades work great especially if you have little kids or grandkids. Gives off a tremendous amount of light in my bedroom. Especially love the reading lamp works great for the computer etc.(Cons) The base is top heavy because of that the lamp will slightly lean to one side not a big deal right now remember this lamp is designed to be set in the corner of a room not moved 10,000 times lol. The side lamp is little flimsy, I understand assembly isn't everyone's strong suit. Basically you get what you pay for which is fineOverall I'm happy with it. For the price of a simple lamp you just can't beat it. Remember don't expect quality again you get what you pay for.",

                "reviewText": "Assembly: very easy, didn't read any instructions as i thought it was more than straight foward what needed to be done.. As other reviewers have said, you need to pull the POWER cable (at the BASE) as you screw in each rod so there isn't excess cable preventing the final rod from being screwed on. The final rod was a bit tougher to screw in than the rest of the rods as i still had a bit too much cable and it was getting in the way. I could see someone shorter than me finding this tough since you need access to both the base and the top at the same time at one point.My Findings:(THE GOOD) The lamp for my uses is great. For two reasons.. FIRST: I put it in between my desk and wall (near corner of room as recommended) which works out very well for one reason.. The base (of my lamp at least this might be a flaw with just my lamp) is not very stable. The poles are sturdy together but they tend to wobble (as one piece) on the base). For this reason i HEAVILY recommend only getting this if you can leave it somewhere where it won't be bumped into by kids or anyone normally.The second main reason this lamp is perfect for me is because i am using the LIFX BR30 Multicolor Light Bulbs (2 of them - one in each fixture on this lamp). The bulbs themselves are accessible VIA wifi through an APP or even my Echo Spot so i never need to even touch this lamp. Again, making the \"wobble factor\" not matter since it will hardly ever be touched or bumped into. Having the adjustable secondary light is awesome. Both fixtures fit the extra large br30 LIFX bulbs perfectly..Worth mentioning - even just one of the LIFX bulbs is more expensive than this entire lamp haha(THE BAD) The only negative i find with this lamp so far (i only just bought it) is the base not being particularly sturdy. I believe i screwed in the first pole as securely as it can be and yet it still leans with the weight. Now, i still marked this 4 stars because one could argue that the added weight of my LIFX BR30 bulbs could be making it wobble a bit more. But to be honest, it was wobbling before i even screwed the bulbs in..",

                "reviewText": "Very pleased with this lamp for the price. For a lamp, it is pretty bright, especially when both bulbs are on. Not so much to brightly light a large room, but enough to add plenty of light for reading/working on activities and to illuminate a dark area. The lamp was easy to assemble, and seems pretty sturdy. It has had no issues with staying on or dimming or anything of the sort, and I have had it for around eight months (since late March 2021). It has stayed on almost constantly, and has not had any issues. The only few issues I have had with this lamp are minor. For one, after moving it around a bit and rotating it, the poles began to loosen somewhat, though this was because I unintentionally loosened them. I was able to tighten them back up easily, however. I also find that it will wobble a bit if you push on it or if you lightly kick the base. It does not wobble when walking by it or even when I stomped near it. It does not seem that it is in danger of falling over or anything like that, even if you kick or push it lightly. It probably would if you run into it hard enough though. Overall I am very pleased with this lamp, especially at the price it is, and highly recommend it. It is quite bright for a lamp; it has two light fixtures, one of which is adjustable/movable; it is easy to assemble; it looks exactly like the image shown and is stylish; and it is pretty sturdy.",
