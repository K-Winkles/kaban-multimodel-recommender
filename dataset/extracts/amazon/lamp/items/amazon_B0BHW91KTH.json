                "reviewText": "I am so happy that I chose this lamp when shopping for my child's homework station. It works just as I needed. The amount of lighting has many settings which allows you to get the perfect amount of light desired. It's different in that you just have to effortlessly slide your finger over the settings, and it immediately changes from the least amount of light to the most amount light. It's not necessary to keep clicking buttons to get it where you want. When you want to turn it off, you press one button.The stand is sturdy as well. The lighting part (about 12\") is also adjustable. It can be raised if you need the light to reach a larger space. It can actually be folded down flush with the stand if you wish.If you need a desk lamp, look no further. The price is right as well, which is a bonus!I am purchasing another one today for my desk. I am anxious to get it, I like my area \"MAJORLY LITE UP\" and it will do just that !",

                "reviewText": "I'm so glad I bought this lamp. A few days after I received this, we had a couple of power outages here in our area because of the rain. I usually place my other flashlight on our center counter to light up our kitchen and my small dining. I was reading my kindle and I realized the lamp next to me was connected to the USB charger and wondered if I could connect it to my power bank and it would light up. And it did! I had this lamp connected for close to 4 hrs and it didn't even drain the power bank.On normal use, I am able to read my kindle and can adjust it to different light settings depending on which activity - reading, watching tv, or just chilling listening to music.Overall, I like this and would recommend it. I think I can even bring this when camping.",

                "reviewText": "The Sympa Desk Lamp is the best and works absolutely perfectly as described and pictured. All features are so easy to use by a finger touch, especially on the tiny red light indicator seen in the dark, to turn lamp off or on. It has one semi-circle of 7 blue lighted, brightness light indicators, (1 is off) and one round button for 5 colour settings from bright white to warm light, activated by simple touch, and will always return to the last settings used when turned on again.The round 7inch base and upright centre pole are sturdy and rotates 45% by hand touch. The cross light arm pole pivots 90% back and forth and bends 100% up and down. It turns in any direction to light up a very large desk space and laptop by more than four feet in all directions. It comes with an electrical socket plugin, a long cord, and side pin insert for power, as well as one low power standard USB port at rear of upright arm. The one piece long LED incandescent light bulb is under a frosted plastic cover, that does not indicate it can be removed....so time will tell how long the LED bulb (almost like a small florescent bulb) will last, is a concern.It came very well packaged in a sturdy, hand carry-all, foam casing cardboard box for travel, storage and keeping. It has been used more than 90 days, from 6-10 daily hours without incident. It became surprised featured on a time deal, and the lowest of all priced, so purchase made and previous one just ordered was returned. Highly, highly recommended as the best quality, designed lamp and purchase ever made on Amazon. Just buy it.",
