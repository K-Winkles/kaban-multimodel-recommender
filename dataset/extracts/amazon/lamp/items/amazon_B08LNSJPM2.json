                "reviewText": "I wanted a floor lamp which was a bit different and this one fit the bill! Packaging was great, a breeze to assemble, nice sturdy lamp, the Edison type bulbs looked great until I turned them on! The brightness was blinding! After ordering 3 different types of bulbs I finally found ones that work for us! 2w LED frosted candelabra bulbs. They are small and they don\u2019t have the neat look of the Edison style bulbs but for us they work. Just remember if ordering this lamp, it doesn\u2019t have shades which normally dim the glare of the bulbs!",

                "reviewText": "Ordered this lamp after searching for a long time for something to brighten up my otherwise dark office. Was worried it was going to be too bright, and it is not. It is exactly what I was hoping for. Yes, it is bright. And, yes, shadows are cast from the cage. But the style and feel of the lamp are perfect for my space. The ceilings are low in this room, so it doesn\u2019t feel too short. It was easy to assemble, took five minutes, it is sturdy and was well packaged with no nicks. I initially found this at Wayfair for nearly twice the price and am glad I had the presence of mind to search on Amazon. Very pleased with every aspect of this order and product.",
