                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is the most adorable little lamp! I\u2019m so impressed! It is exactly as advertised. With the press of a button I can dim the light or make it brighter, plus it changes colors as I would like! It was a bit confusing putting the lamp shade on, there were no directions but I ended up pressing the two metal prongs together (I was afraid I would break it) but it ended up working perfect. I love it!",

                "reviewText": "This little cutie really brightens up my tiny living room, especially on dark winter days and evenings. It's brighter than it looks in the photos--less yellow, more white. You might think it's just because of my bulb, but no--I'm using the bulb it came with. I think...Anyway, I love that the shade looks whiter and brighter than it does in the Amazon photo.I like that I can tap it for different levels of brightness.Finally, this lamp also has a couple of USB ports, though I never use them. One caveat: the base is a tad uneven and lightweight, making it feel slightly unstable, but in truth, it's never fallen over, even when I bumped a stack of library books against it! I'd buy this lamp again.",
