I managed to repair it, the bottom is now attached to the rest of the lamp and the lamp works well. Perfect for what I want. I use it when I am reading books. I chose this lamp because it takes 60 watt bulbs which many lamps do not. I like it well enough to purchase another but this time I will pay the extra five dollars despite the fact Amazon Warehouse once again lists the used product as \"like new\". One of the best things about this lamp is that the light bulb does not protrude from under the shade",
