It was easy to assemble the body of the lamp, it works great, and because the body of the lamp is so thin it can fit anywhere. We originally bought it to go in our kitchen until our overhead light could be fixed, but now we use it to add extra light near our couch. The LED panel is very bright on its highest setting, but it can be turned down if you don\u2019t need it as bright. It\u2019s absolutely worth the money, and if something happens to our lamp I\u2019m definitely getting another one.",

If it's referring to the dimmer switch, that is five stars.*My 13 yo son put this together for me in less than ten minutes. It's an amazing lamp and I would buy this for more rooms if I needed to. The slim profile makes is gorgeous and goes with my modern farmhouse aesthetic. The dimmer options are great to change the mood of the room and adjust for lighting for TV time. The highest option is bright and can light up an entire room. The dimmer is sensitive too which I like because you don't have to put much effort into turning the light on.I was a bit hesitant to purchase it because of the price - like would it be worth it - and I would definitely say yes it's worth it.",

Set up was a breeze, easy to follow directions and no tools involved. The color and finish is very nice. I got the bronze. The brightness of the lamp is great, it almost lights up my whole living room which is quite large- over 25 ft long. The fixture itself is non obtrusive, which I like.-Cons: The head of the lamp is flimsy. It doesn't angle to direct the light in all directions and when it does angle it is minimal. My fear is that the head will break off. Also the switch to dim the light and to turn off on is so sensitive, my concern is that it will easily become defective. Also, I did not receive the remote with this item. I would prefer to use remote than the switch to dim the light or turn off and on.I will be contacting the seller to request they send the remote.I really like this lamp over all. I will use it for a month or two and if it holds up I will purchase two more for the other rooms in my home.",

However, the top (the light itself) swivels not very much side to side as I hoped it would, so it doesn\u2019t do much good for reading, just for ambiance., as it can only be aimed higher up toward the wall and ceiling. Regardless, it is a lovely modern streamlined light and easy to assemble, as advertised! I especially like the dimmable feature.",

It is so bright, and lights up the whole living room. It\u2019s very classic looking and even dims! The power button is a touch, and it\u2019s very easy to assemble. Only takes about 5 mins to put together.",

                "reviewText": "Currently, I own 5 of these lamps, which provide great lighting at a reasonable price. I don't have a remote and don't know if one is made for this floorlamp. I like the lamp's slender design, which makes it easy to move. Although the lamp has multiple brightness settings, I always use the highest, and it provides excellent illumination for any room in my house. If a smaller version of the lamp were available for bedroom end tables, I would also purchase them.",

I keep calling this the \"Sun\" lamp when it is on its highest setting. Nice stepdown between the 3 brightness levels. Lowest is good ambient light, middle good for most everyday lighting needs, highest for when you really need to see well. Very simple and quick to put together, took maybe 5 minutes. The midcentury-inspired brass finish is a lovely touch, and the slim profile means it fits into some fairly tight spaces. Might pick up a second one for another room!",
