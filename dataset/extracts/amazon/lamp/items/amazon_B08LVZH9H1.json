The lamp wasn't expensive, but it looks expensive.My only complaint is that it's a little bit smaller than I would've liked, but I also have a huge living room, so that could be the problem. I might order a second one to balance it out. It would look great in an office or study, too.",

                "reviewText": "Alright, so I got this Dimmable Floor Lamp from Amazon, the one with that cool farmhouse industrial vibe. It's this standing tree lamp with these elegant teardrop cage heads, and let me tell you, it's a beaut in my living room. Came with these 800 lumens LED Edison bulbs, and the whole setup just screams quality.First off, the assembly was a piece of cake. Didn't need to be a rocket scientist to put it together \u2013 it was pretty straightforward. And the sturdiness? This thing's solid. Doesn\u2019t wobble or feel flimsy like some of those other lamps I've had in the past.The look of it is something else. It's got this rustic yet modern feel, blending in perfectly with my living room decor. The teardrop cages around the bulbs are a nice touch, giving off a classy, vintage look. And those Edison bulbs? They're not just for show. They light up the room just right, not too harsh, but bright enough to read or work by.Now, the dimmer function is a real winner. I can dial in the exact amount of light I need, whether I'm kicking back to watch TV or I need more light for working on my projects. Plus, the fact that it's LED means I'm saving on my electricity bill too.This lamp's perfect for anyone who wants that industrial-chic style without breaking the bank. It's got a great look, it's practical, and it's built to last. For anyone looking to add a bit of character to their space, this floor lamp is a solid choice. Highly recommend it to my buddies and anyone else looking for a quality lamp.",

                "reviewText": "Surpassed my expectations! Incredibly easy to assemble and the fact that it comes with the dimmable LED Edison bulbs was a huge bonus. Doesn\u2019t look flimsy, yet tucks nicely into a small corner. Nice modern farmhouse/industrial vibe yet a certain old world charm",

Llevo dos semanas con ella por lo que hasta ahorita no me ha fallado para nada. Har\u00e9 una actualizaci\u00f3n en caso de que pudiera ocurrir. Por lo pronto, yo si la recomiendo.",

                "reviewText": "We just developed our basement, but because of the way we placed our furniture we could not place side table lamps. We have pot lights but this floor lamp gives a feeling of coziness in a corner. Like the fact that you can dim it for mood or brighten it for bright light in a corner for reading. Easy to assemble and seems sturdy. Goes well with our other matte black accessories.",
