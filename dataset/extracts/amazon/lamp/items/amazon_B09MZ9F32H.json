It\u2019s not meant to be a primary light source so it benefits from warmer bulbs, (3k or under in the light temp scale and no more than 40 watts - preferably 25). The warmer the bulb, the more attractive the glow. It\u2019s the ideal sort of accent light for on top of a credenza or buffet or sideboard or entry table.",

I needed to reseat the ring on the globe to avoid light leaks (pictured), which was easily done with a small screwdriver. It has a dot in the frosting. You will need a candelabra shaped bulb to fit through the hole or to remove the trim ring to install a regular shaped bulb. All that said, I\u2019m still really happy with this lamp. It\u2019s a great look that isn\u2019t the same lamp you see everywhere at a nice budget price. It works well and the pieces are still sturdy. I\u2019d buy it again, despite the very minor oddities to get the high end look on my low end budget!",

There's just one problem: the base is the standard, medium E26. Yet the opening in the glass lamp shade is too narrow for the diameter of a standard light bulb.It's problematic because this lamp was bought for ambience lighting, to use with a smart light bulb which cost far more more than the fixture itself. So now the options are to return the lamp or shop for a second, expensive smart bulb which is particularly narrow (which might not even exist). Disappointing, overall.",
