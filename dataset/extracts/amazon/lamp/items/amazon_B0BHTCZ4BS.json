                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Should you buy the lamp?",
                "reviewText": "How did you end up here?I got here after looking through many pages of \"mid-century\" lamps and this one caught my eye as well.Does it have a lot of reviews? no.Have you ever heard of this brand? no.I was thinking the same thing a few days ago and decided to take a leap. It's a bit pricey but something about it made me take a chance and a few days later here it is.--PackagingCame well packed and with no damage, although the foam was very crumbly so got a bit messy when removing it from the box. Not a big issue but just something to be aware of if you don't like those little bits of foam all over the place.--ConstructionThe base is nicely weighted and sits nicely as it also has a faux felted bottom. I'm not expert on metal but it feels like metal or at least a very high quality immitation and it catches the light nicely and has a nice finish.The glass is a bit hard to gauge from the promotional pictures but it is not smooth and has a more frosted texture. The rims are also a bit unfinished and thus a little sharp, something to be aware of as it takes some adjusting to make sure its centered when assembling.The cord is ok, although the clicker for turning on the light is right in the middle of the cord. While this gives you slack to tuck the cord out of sight it makes it a bit difficult to place the lamp just so within reach of where you plug it in and still be able to turn it on easily.--PriceI'm a bit hesitant to say it's a good price. While the construction is solid and it works with no issues so far I'd say it's still on the high side. I think maybe somewhere in the 45-55 price range would make this a bit more pallatable. Or if some other touches were added to justify the high price it might make it a stronger reccomend.--SuggestionsPerhaps lower the price or consider some changes to the build quality to make it more worth the price.1stI would say that the frosted glass makes it feel a bit less premium, if the glass was the smooth like murano style glass it would definitely improve the appearence and justify the price point. At the very least a bit more finishing on the rims would at least prevent any potential cuts.2ndThe cord should be a bit more premium, perhaps one of those woven cords with a bit more slack on the wall side to make it easier to place the lamp.3rdIf it included a vintage style bulb to enhance the vintage look and light output it would be a nice touch.--Final ThoughtOverall if you are looking for this style of lamp, and don't mind plunking down a few more bucks then it might be worth, I'd say go for it.I can't speak for the clear variants but if the manufacturer wants to kick one my way I'd give it a thorough review.Would I buy another one in the future?I'd definitely consider it, especially if it was updated or lowered in price. I think it would also work as a nice gift for fans of vintage lighting.So yeah take a chance on it if this all sounds good to you!",
