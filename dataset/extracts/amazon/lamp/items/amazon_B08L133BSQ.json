                "reviewText": "I purchased two of these to use in our bedroom and I easily assembled each lamp on my own in just under 10 minutes. I\u2019m not a handy person at all, it was just that simple. Although, if you have hand weakeness or arthritis in your hands you might find it difficult to do on your own. I could picture my arthritic mother finding the job too painful. However, for a 30 Year old stay at home mom with very little hand strength I had no issues. Everything I needed was included and nothing was scratched, broken, or dented. The light is very sturdy and exceeded my expectations. I don\u2019t foresee these tipping easily as the base was twice as heavy and solid as I expected and it\u2019s not wobbly. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d leave my 18 month old to play around it unsupervised though. I could see a toddler or preschooler pulling it over if they really tried. I don\u2019t see it falling or tipping easily on accident though. The gold color is a lovely shiny metal and the metal is also higher quality than I was expecting. The cord is nice and long too with a floor switch that you can press easily with your foot. I\u2019d definitely recommend these to family or friends.Cons-I don\u2019t personally have an issue with this but if I offered this company any feedback on a way they could improve their product it would be to somehow have the white part where the lightbulb screws in to blend in a little more with the rest of the beauty of the lamp. When you\u2019re close the white plastic just detracts a little bit from the overall aesthetic. That being said though, I\u2019m satisfied and think this company exceeded my Amazon shopping expectations.",

What I have noticed is a ton of user error in the photos and videos and wanted to make sure I pointed them out so that you avoid the same.The white pieces (2) that hold the bulb together go INSIDE the glass. This will avoid two things 1) it being crooked and 2) the stability of the glass.2) the instructions are vague but if you look at the pictures carefully, you\u2019ll notice that they sent a metal cylinder piece along with a small metal stick. You\u2019re supposed to insert the metal stick through two holes on the metal cylinder and use it like an Allen tool. Under the base of the lamp, is a metal socket. Use the tool to twist this socket tight. This will help stabilize your poles.Again, all user error in these reviews. If done right, this lamp is extremely sturdy and STUNNING. Highly recommend.",
