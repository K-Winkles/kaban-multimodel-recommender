I bought two \"A: white\" floor lamps and may buy more because they are so versatile! Using one at lowest setting to add a touch of light in a dark corner of the dining room and using another at medium brightness for bedside reading (see attached pictures). When turned up to brightest setting, it will light up a good bit of the room (not pictured). It fits in a narrow space, is modern-looking, and puts out warm, dimmable light = perfect. TIP: If it doesn't light up the first time you turn it on, and after you've plugged it in, installed the bulb, and installed the batteries into the remote, you may need to step on the foot switch, first. ; ) Don't ask me how I know.
