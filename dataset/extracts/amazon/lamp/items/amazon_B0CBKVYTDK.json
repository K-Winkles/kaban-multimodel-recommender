                "reviewText": "This lamp is great!! Looks beautiful and I only paid $16 for it, and it really is glass, yet not super thin/fragile!! This lamp does not look cheap at all, while the other lamps I looked at in this low price range all looked super cheap in REALITY (compared to the stock pics that make em look beautiful n classy) and u have to actually build the shade n everything on those..not the case with this lamp, the shade comes already put together, no dealing with clips n Velcro for a weird cheapo shade..I literally just had to- 1.take lamp outta box, 2.put bulb in, and 3.plug it in..that's it..and no annoying twist on/off on the base, I hate those things, nope this one has the push button on the cord..I am in the middle of redo-ing my living room and the walls will b painted light grey with an accent wall of a teal color (across the room from the lamp, making this a great lil detail piece), and this lamp with look perfect and help tie it all together!!! The lamp is actually bigger than I imagined it would be, which is funny cuz all the reviews on those other cheap lamps everyone complains how they r so much smaller than they thought it would b..if I wanna get nitpicky then I could mention how there r a cpl slight imperfections on the shade (u can see em in the close-up pic of the shade), but they r so small n minor I don't mind, besides I just turn the shade around so u don't see it and remind myself that minor things r gonna happen to the shade anyways, espec with a kid, big dog, and 2 cats (and the shade isn't bent or anything like that, it actually was packaged well to keep it all safe and in tact), n it arrived super fast...love this lamp and is perfect for our entryway space, and I can't wait to see how great it looks when I have all my other colors changed to match!!! Btw I'm super glad they made the smart choice to use white for the cord color, they could've done black or something and that would've just ruined it, so I'm glad they didn't mess up on that..I'm already planning on buying more in other colors for other rooms!! we all love this lamp and highly recommend it!!",
