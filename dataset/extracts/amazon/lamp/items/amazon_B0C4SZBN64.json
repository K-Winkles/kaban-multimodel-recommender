Nice Design.- Long clear cord. Because it's clear you hardly even see it against the wall.- The shade is so much better than I expected. It looks like real linen.- Very easy to assemble. Even the shade. I recommend doing the velcro last though.CONS:- The shade seems slightly big for the lamp, but that's probably just me. And they are easy to swap out. See the photo.PROPS - Gotta note that when the box came I thought they'd only sent me one. It's like Tetris inside... not one 1/4 \" of wasted space yet packed very securely. Well done. I hate wasted packaging.",

                "reviewText": "My first thought when I received these is how are there 2 lamps in this small box. These require a fair bit of unboxing with lots of tape and styrofoam, then assembly. This not a simple unbox and set out item, so definitely keep that in mind. You'll want about an hour or so to carefully unbox and assemble both of them. Once they are set up they are very pretty lamps which I have received numerous compliments on. The shades are a wonderful linen style in a neutral color which doesn't reduce lighting. The white ceramic should look great in practically any home. The 23\" size seems perfect for my living room end tables. Overall, I would highly recommend these lamps to anyone able to assemble them. I haven't purchased lamps from Amazon or other online retailers before, but I'd imagine they all require assembly due to shipping so keep that in mind as well.",
