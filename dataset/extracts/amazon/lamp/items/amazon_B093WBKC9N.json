I gave it a 3 for sturdiness, because, like all RTA pieces, I'm sure I'll need to tighten the pole connections over time. But overall, for $30, it is super stylish and when assembled correctly (easy!), is functional and attractive. I have a 40 watt bulb in it at the moment, because that's all I had on hand. The ambiance is great. May bump up to 60 watt and am sure it will provide adequate illumination to read by. Would definitely recommend.",

In other words, they were saying it was cheap and flimsy, but actually I disagree!First of all, the base that goes on the floor is nice and heavy, which keeps the lamp from being easily knocked over and gives it a real good stability. The mounting process is the absolute easiest, it took less than 5min before the lamp was on display. My boyfriend originally only had a super bright white overhead light in his bedroom, which I hate, so this lamp was the perfect choice to give a warm ambiance/cozy ambiance to the room Without having to sell a kidney lol.A bit unfortunate that the light bulb isn\u2019t included but at that price, it\u2019s ok I guess.Make sure you choose a good light bulb, and this little guy will light up your whole room and give it a perfect vibe at the same time.",

I was looking for something a little more exciting but the reality is I didn't have the room to have 2 of the lamps I wanted flanking the apartment sofa and held off. Then while searching for a floor lamp for my daughter's room, I came upon these and realized they'd work for my purposes. The price was pretty good and customers seemed satisfied with them so I ordered them. They came in compact boxes and were super easy and intuitive to put together. They're not pieces designed to garner attention. They're mostly functional but in an understated way, and, yes, I think slightly elegant. I ordered the silver ones with gray shades and they give off a subdued light, which is fine for my purposes here. I also ordered the gold with white shade for my daughter's room and noticed those shades are the same shape but bigger. I might've preferred that size for these but they're ok as is. I think they'll work well enough for the art work (amazon), which just came in and will be hung this weekend. I recommend these.",

                "reviewText": "These lamps were very easy to put together. I did it myself, and I'm not handy. They are rather flimsy, chintzy, and lightweight, but have a very small footprint, and fit perfectly where I wanted to put them. I got a matching set for the bedroom and put 25-watt yellow lights in them and they give the room a soft, soothing glow. One thing I don't like is that they are foot-pedal on and off only. I like the remote control kind with the variable light choices. No choices with this one, but they are serving the purpose I intended and working well.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted something slim, modern, and unobtrusive to go in the corner of my living room behind the side table. This seemed like the perfect dimensions\u2026which it is.The base is sturdy, the foot switch is very nice to have. The quality of the shade is where the problem is. I fully expected to have to assemble the shade based on previous online lamp purchases. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because this one is so long and narrow, but it was hard to get it to line up with the support rings. I made it work, but the edge is already slightly bent where it attaches, it\u2019s hard to get it to be perfectly vertical, and you can see loose threads on the edge.From a distance it looks fine and it\u2019s far enough back from the seating that it\u2019s not obvious unless you\u2019re really looking at it, so I kept it. I\u2019ll probably upgrade to a higher quality lamp in the near future and put this in our storage room instead.",

                "reviewText": "We wanted to have a lamp in our reading corner of the living room and this floor lamp fits perfectly - exactly what I had envisioned. The shade is pretty good quality - a nice beige with a bit of pattern to match another floor lamp in the room and the black metal stand is quite sturdy. When it's on, it gives off a nice ambience to the room. Also, customer service was pretty good too. I didn't have any specific concerns but I really appreciated that they provided an updated when the product was prepared, processed, shipped, etc. It wasnt amazon who gave the updates, but the folks selling the lamp. If I were to nit pick, maybe it would be that the on/off switch would be weighted so it doesn't twist in odd angles when turning on the lamp. Overall, I would highly recommend this lamp!!!",
