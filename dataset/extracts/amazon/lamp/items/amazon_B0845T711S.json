I bought an E12 socket adapter and bought a a chandelier E12 bulb to make it look normal. it works, looks good. just be aware you may need to wrestle a bit with the bulb size to get it right. also the metal legs do not have and rubber or nonslip coatings on the bottom, so it slides easily on a smooth surface. 4 stars because of the bulb size issue and the slippery base.",
