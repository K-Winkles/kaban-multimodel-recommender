                "reviewText": "The Junnai Navy Blue Table Lamp is a five star winner. It looks right at home with the traditional d\u00e9cor in our living room. It will also fit nicely in our our modern bedroom. It is as well made as it is attractive. The included bulb does not flicker in any of the three dimming levels. My wife and I love it.Speaking of dimming, it is 3-way, but not the old style that requires a costly and hard to find 3-way bulb; you can use any normal bulb in it as long it is dimmable. If you plug this into a wall outlet that is switchable know that if it is switched off at the wall when the light is on that it will come back on with the wall switch, but always at the lowest dimmer level.It took literally five minutes to put together; including unrolling and fitting the shade material into its frame. You will see a shadow line where the shade material overlaps at it Velcro seam, which is to be expected with this type of lamp.",

                "reviewText": "I am very impressed with the appearance and quality of this lamp. The beveled design of the blue ceramic is timeless and the optic white shade is the perfect complement for the base. Most of the lamps I've purchased in the past within this price range came with a very cheap looking shade, but this one has a textured grain look and is banded top and bottom. I think this shade is lovely and I will definitely not need to replace it. The lamp itself is the ideal height for a bedside lamp and I appreciate the dimmable capability that allows me to use it on the lowest lighting level in early evening or adjust it to full brightness for reading at night. The lamp was delivered to me a day after I placed the order, it was well-packed and had no damage and setup took less than a minute since the bulb was included. I think this lamp is a \"find.\"",

                "reviewText": "I have this lamp sitting on a credenza in my home office to provide some accent lighting. The navy blue base is unique looking and very attractive. The base is heavy enough that this won't tip over easily. From the table top to the top of the shade, it is about 25\" tall. It includes a built in dimmer that works like an old school 3-way dimmer, but this works with any type of E26 base lightbulb. It comes with a 60 watt incandescent equivalent 3,000K light bulb but you can swap this out with any standard lightbulb you want.One item of note, the power cord is only 3' long. So, you may need an extension cord. This was not worth deducting a star because I like this lamp a lot.I'm really pleased with this light thus far. It looks great.",

As you turn it, it goes Hi, Off, Medium, Off, Dim, Off. It must be replaced with the same type of bulb to retain the 3 way feature.",

This is for a guest bedroom and I already ordered an other one. This lamp is stable and is good height for a bedside table. I ways look for 3way switches and it has that too. I really like that it turns off between changes in brightness. If you use the same level of light most of the time, you don't have to run through the circuit. I am delighted. Please note (if the camera will pick it up) the way the light plays on the geometric pattern.",
