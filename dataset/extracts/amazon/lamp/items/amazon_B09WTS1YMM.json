                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Seems safe from an electrical point of view!",
                "reviewText": "What's inside?I was curious about the electronics given that the lamp is from China so I took mine apart. The AC power cable (which is polarized and has a UL logo on it, no idea if that's legitimate or not) goes into the metal base through a plastic grommet to two plastic wire nuts which also have heat shrink tubing around them. The cable also passes through a strain relief with fireproof insulation at the base of the post to prevent pinching -- so this and the grommet provide two points of contact which is nice.The wire nuts connect the AC lead to the bulb power directly and branch off to a separate AC-DC converter that provides the 5V for USB. The converter is a sealed plastic module.So inside the base there are no exposed wires, no exposed electronics, or anything that looks shoddy. I don't think there's any failure mode where the metal base could get electrified given that the AC wires go into wire nuts and heat shrink tubing. The inside is powder coated too so there's no exposed metal for a live wire to touch.The USB connector housing is screwed into the base, but they additionally put hot glue on there so it's really firmly attached and isn't loose.Pros:Electronics seem good.Pull chain has a nice clicky action and is easy to fumble around for in the dark.Fits any standard lightbulb, and lampshade is tall enough that longer or bigger bulbs will fit with no problem.5V USB charging parts are handy and work well. I measured 5.15V on mine which I think is acceptable when unloaded; when loaded it's closer to 5.04V.Cons (minor):The included light bulb runs fairly hot. I swapped it out for a GE warm light bulb that I knew would run cool and it also ran cool. So if that bothers you, just use a different bulb.Like a lot of cheap lamps the base is not solid and has an adhesive foam square that covers the hollow base where the internals are. I don't like this and would gladly pay more for that to be a metal plate held in place with 4 screws instead. If you place the lamp on a bumpy surface you can \"poke in\" the foam so the bottom isn't flat anymore. Just make sure it's resting on a totally flat surface at all times.The wires from the AC-DC converter to the USB connector look a little flimsy so don't try to pull too much current through it. If you're just charging normal electronics like your phone you'll be fine. If you have some weird USB powered gizmo with a heater or motor that uses a lot of current I wouldn't use it on this lamp.Think of it as a more traditional USB port for slow charging overnight, that's the use case it's really built for.In closing:Overall I like the lamp. It was easy to assemble, looks good, having the USB ports is super handy, and I felt the electrical stuff looked pretty safe. Is it really UL listed? Probably not. Is the wiring and construction substantially better than what I'd expect for a no-name lamp? Absolutely.",

The included bulb is a bit more than I expected, however. The warm color (augmented by the beige lamp shade) is exactly what I wanted, but it is REALLY bright. I\u2019d intended this to be a desk lamp in my office but the bulb is so bright it immediately caused some major eye strain. Moved it to my beside table and that was somewhat better, but I swapped it out for a 5w bulb and it\u2019s perfect. The included bulb does get very hot in a short amount of time, something I\u2019ve never seen with LED bulbs, so maybe it\u2019s good to swap it out anyway.",
