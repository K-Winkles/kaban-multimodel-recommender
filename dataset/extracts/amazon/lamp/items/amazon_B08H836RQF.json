                "reviewText": "Updated Review: After writing my initial review, the manufacturer reached out to me and wanted to set things right since the initial products I received did not work as intended. I received another lamp and it worked just as advertised. No loose bolts, and the socket seems set in place. I appreciate their commitment to the product, and the new one sent to me was in perfect working order, so I'm giving them another star.Aesthetically, these lamps look pretty good. The brushed brass looks pretty good and has decent coloration. As far as working as a lamp, they work well. The in-line switch works to turn the light on and off, and no issues with flickering while lights are on. My issues with these lamps are the quality of construction. I ordered two and both came with loose screws to hold the socket to the spot where it connects to the electricity. After tightening the screws, I figured it was fine, but then I realized that the socket mechanism is not actually attached to the lamp base. When I tried to unscrew the bulbs, the sockets just spun within the base. I had to find a way to isolate the socket so I could unscrew the bulb without putting too much pressure on the bulb.",
