Also, I thought the beige one would have the RGB capability but I guess I looked at a different color lampshade. But that\u2019s okay! The lamp itself is a little wobbly/not that sturdy. The lighting itself is really nice though, I love being able to dim it and change the temperature of the light to warmer or cooler! I also like that it has a remote. My main complaint though is the smell of the box/product itself. I\u2019m not sure what the company uses to package these, but I absolutely hated the smell! Otherwise, I\u2019d probably purchase a second one for my bedroom lol. But for now I\u2019ll just keep the one in my living room.",

I hope it\u2019s just the bulb. I ordered some new smart bulbs so hopefully that fixes it. Video added alsoYes these to feel kind of cheap, especially the way the shade goes on. But they are still super cute and minimalist. When you have two lamps, you\u2019re better off using the app (QR code on the bulb box). The RGB doesn\u2019t match without it.Super simple to put together and set up. I would consider them sturdy. If you have a baby just be careful they don\u2019t pull them over.",
