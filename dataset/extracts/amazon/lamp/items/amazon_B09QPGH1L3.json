                "reviewText": "Well, I initially went down the Rabitt hole with a lot of other reviewers who were unable to find the right bulb for this lamp. I am here to tell you that it is NOT true! The bulb is noted clearly in the directions. I believe that many including myself, initially thought the bulb was not the normal screw in type after looking at the opening. It appears that it could be for one of those bulbs that has the prongs. It is not!! It is a normal candelabra bulb (the skinny base ones) that you can buy anywhere. Just be sure it is the skinny based ones and not the fatter candelabra bulbs with the bigger screw in base. That\u2019s what that \u201cb\u201d I believe stands for. Now about the lamp!!! Super cute and heavy base! I love it and plan to order another one for a nook in my kitchen. Worth every penny!!! Love it!!!",

I would only change how the cord hangs off the back so it wasn\u2019t as bulky. Make note that this won\u2019t take a bright bulb but is perfect for a warm light bulb to dimly add light to a space which was exactly what I wanted.",

Also, even though they are small, two of them in the same room do provide enough light for the whole space. They are my only source of light in a small/medium sized room, and it's very bright. I also had a heck of a time finding bulbs for them. They use e12 bulbs which are similar to a chandelier bulb, but you can't use chandelier bulbs because they'll stick out the top of the lampshade. I found some on amazon finally that work great and are even wifi enabled, but still was quite challenging.",
