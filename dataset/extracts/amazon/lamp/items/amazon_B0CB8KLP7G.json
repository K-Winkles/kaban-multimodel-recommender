                "reviewText": "The floor lamp assembly was extremely easy to set up and get going. The included instructions were very clear and precise, and could easily be followed. I originally got this swamp to add some dimmed and or subdued, lighting for my flight simulator set up. The lighting of the floor lamp has several levels of subdued, lighting in some cases for me particularly was just too dim. Once I got the light together and started using it, I loaded the required iOS software on my iPhone to manage the lighting settings. I would have rather would have included in the box a physical remote control for simplicity. However, that being said the iOS application on both the iPhone and iPad worked very well. In my particular situation, I had an android tablet that I wanted to run the floor lamp from , but the android application did not work very well for me. One of the biggest disappointments for me was the fact that I would have to pull out an iPad or my iPhone to manage any settings, including on and off when you\u2019re in a cockpit This is just too inconvenient. Now the lighting, and charging capability, I thought work pretty well. I really like the how the charging cable went up through the center of the pole for better cable management. I think dollar for dollar the lighting should have been may be a little brighter and it probably wouldn\u2019t have hurt to go ahead and throw a remote control in the box whether you used it or not. I enjoyed the light and I can see uses for it all over the house, but since I had some control issues, it made it more difficult than I needed to be. If you are looking for a floor lamp that you just need some lighting to sit in your chair, relax and do some things this would probably be the floor lamp for you. The one thing I need to point out is that all of the controls are all Bluetooth. Many of the types of lamps that this product falls into our either Bluetooth, or infrared remote capability. In my humble opinion, any included remote control should be an RF remote control, and that way you don\u2019t have to point and get all swirly with your remote get things to work properly. This is probably a manufacturer decision and not so much on the reliability of the product. Was I happy with the floor lamp, yes I was, it just did not fit my Particular needs.",

                "reviewText": "It's really neat idea and I like the style overall. I believe there's a quality control issue though one of my lights immediately stopped working on green. So that is to say when I got it out of the box I tested everything. It worked fine and then one moment that worked the next it didn't. The entire green color went out of one of the light. Pucks so I can do red. It can do blue but it cannot do green. I think it's green. There might be blue either way. One of the colors stopped working and it's only on one buck. When I turn on that color, select just that color. It just doesn't do anything. It's black, it's unlit and when I select other colors they work when I select a color that mixes with that color that does not work. I don't get that color so I think it's green could be blue. It's so say you're trying to do yellow. You can't get yellow because the green doesn't work and all you get is a blue or might be purple. Might be blue that doesn't work. So when you try purple all you get is red. Either way same problem. Not quite sure of which color it is. That's not working anymore. It's been a couple weeks since I tried this unit out and I just haven't had a chance to review it",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I am a HUGE fan of lighting set ups! I am a constant creator, and Im always paying attention to the lights and how they are arranged in different settings. When I come across a light that is, not not only visually appealing, but also functional, I\u2019m down for it!When I found this lamp I quickly hit the order button!Assembly is fairly simple. Just follow the instructions and it shouldn\u2019t take more than about 10 minutes to get the entire unit set up.Right out of the box I was very excited! The material used to make this lamp is amazing! I feel like it was made with the idea of durability in mind. The base is very solid! Both the base and the rod are made with good quality metal.The \u201clight disc\u201d themselves are made of a sturdy plastic. I love how the lights connect directly to the stand so charging is a breeze! This also allows for you to keep the lights plugged in so they won\u2019t die on you randomly! With a very simple two button operation system. You can cycle between colors, brightness and lighting effects directly from the disk itself.The magnetic capabilities of this lamp are like none I\u2019ve seen before. I have done a lot of shopping around and very few lights have a magnetic feature anything like this! This feature allows for smooth and easy attachment/detachment! It also makes repositioning and maneuvering the lights in different directions simple and effective!There are different levels of warmth for this light, which gives you flexibility for a while range of shot temperatures. This is also a RBG light, which gives you a full color spectrum experience! This is extremely useful and you want to have a different feel for the environment you place the light in! The color and lighting options are vibrant and great for presentation!The app options, offer a wide range of settings for the light, including \u2014\u2014 3 Light Modes, Brightness, RGB modes, Different Ambient modes and Timing settings.I love the fact that there are app options, but I would have preferred a remote.This is a modern and simplistic lamp that helps add another level of stye to any environment you add it to!100% WORTH THE INVESTMENT!",
