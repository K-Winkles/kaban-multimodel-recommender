The different brightness and color settings are such great features and so easy to turn on and off with just a quick touch of your fingers. Will be buying more in the future.",

This light is prefect lightening for reading at night while my partner sleeps. It has a sleek look and is very lightweight, I will move it to bed when I am writing and love all the color choices. Best part is that it foesnt have to be plugged in, I charged it then unplugged it and left it unplugged until the next week when I had to charge. Did I mention the easy on and off, just lightly tap it on and off",

But the changing colors are more pastel. The changing colors are very smooth and it is a nice touch to a dim room.The lights stay on for a long time. I left one in the bathroom overnight for guests and it was still running fine in the morning. I also like the hanging clip in the base for hanging them. I plan to use mine to hang from my deck umbrella at night in the summer.",

                "reviewText": "I have purchased two of these lights so far, and I\u2019m back to buy a third. I use one as a night light in my guest bedroom, and the other as a desk lamp. The overhead light in my office is too bright, and sometimes I start work early, before the sun comes up. Even at the lower white settings, this little lamp gives me enough light to write or see the keyboard, but is gentle on the eyes before I\u2019ve had my coffee. The changing colors are a fun option, and I only need to touch the top gently to change the settings. I do not use the battery on this lamp, it stays plugged in all the time, so I can\u2019t speak to that feature.My only complaints are:1) It comes with standard USB to mini-USB cable, which is outdated AF. A wall charger is not included, so a standard USB adapter is required to plug it in. Fortunately I had a few of these already, so I didn\u2019t have to buy one specifically for this lamp.2) The product description is a little misleading. The second image shows pink and purple colors, which don\u2019t exist. As shown in the first image, you get multiple shades of white, plus red, green, and blue.However, this lamp does its job well, is easy to use, and has been reliable for two years so far. I feel comfortable recommending this, especially at this price point, as long as you know what you\u2019re getting.",

I used the higher white light setting and it was great for a soft light in the room and was enough to light the hall in front of bathroom so I don\u2019t trip over my gray cat. Its cordless with a recharagable battery that of course has to be charged via USB cable I kept it plugged in all the time tho but only had it on at night. The brightest light seems to be dimmer after over a year but it still works and the other colors add a nice ambiance too This is a great light for a child\u2019s room bedroom, bathroom, hallway or anywhere u need an extra light or just some ambiance.",
