It was a breeze to assemble and the floor switch is very convenient. I can walk into the dark room with my hands full and turn the light on without effort. When it is on the shade casts a patterned shadow across the wall. It lights up the whole room but it also makes a perfect project or reading lamp. The holes in the shade make sure the light reaches everywhere in the room but has enough rattan so it isn't as harsh as a bare bulb.",

                "reviewText": "This floor lamp from Newfs is really a solidly built lamp and a very nice size. It has a durable black/ bronze finish\u2026durable as I knocked it against the cabinet when I was assembling it and didn\u2019t do any damage to the lamp. Also as I was almost finished tightening the post, I swung it around and hit myself in the head with the arc\u2026so caution is advised\u2026I guess I was just having a clumsy day. The floor lamp is 60\u201d tall to the top of the round ball and 62\u201d at its tallest. The shade is 12 1/2\u201d wide and really neat how it is woven.It is made for a single wattage bulb ( so it isn\u2019t a 3 way bulb - and 3 way bulbs are kind a thing of the past since we have moved to LED technology. ) The lamp has a push button built into the cord that sits on the floor so you can turn the lamp on and off with your foot.I really like the look of this Boho inspired floor lamp. It\u2019s just the right height to swing around over your shoulder if you need to read or look at something up close. It has that current contemporary twist.The only thing that kind of surprised me was that the cord comes out above the base by about 2\u201d \u2026.I hadn\u2019t seen this before but I think it makes it much easier to assemble. Also in assembling lamps, the plastic that covers the individual metal rods is tear away so you don\u2019t have to cut it or anything, just grab and pull and it will split open as you pull.I did use a pair of channel lock pliers to tighten the base of the lamp onto the post. When it got to a modest tightness, the nut under the base just spun, to I held the channel lock pliers on the nut and rotated the post. I was cautious not to over-tighten for risk of stripping the metal insert but wanted to get everything nice and solid.I did do one ooopsy\u2026I thought the shade might be slightly tilted so I pushed on the shade to try to adjust and it cracked the nut that screws on to hold the shade on the lamp. Some super glue and allowing the plastic nut to cure ( so it wouldn\u2019t become permanently attached to the socket.) and I was back in business. If you think yours needs any adjustment, do so without the shade installed so that this doesn\u2019t happen to you. I am very glad I chose this floor lamp from Newfs",

It was incredibly easy to set up and looks exactly like the photos. It\u2019s sturdy with a heavy base. Not sure if my eyes are playing tricks on me but I think the pole is slightly leaning, so that\u2019s why I could give a complete 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "Very nice bohemian rattan lamp that complemented another rattan lamp that we already had in the room. The matte black metal and rattan are simple and stylish and can fit in with a variety of decorating styles.The lamp is solidly made and is heavy enough that it is very stable on the base. It was also very easy to put together (should be 10 minutes or less) and didn\u2019t require any additional tools.The design of the rattan shade allows for good light dispersion, and the lamp could be used as a primary light source for a bedroom or mid-sized living room using a larger LED bulb (15W/1600 lumens). We use it primarily as reading lamp (perfect for this) and a complementary lamp (1 of 3) for a larger living room so smaller bulbs (9W/800 lumens) provide a nice balance of ambient light for the room and directed light for reading.We are very pleased with the floor lamp and would highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "So this is the second floor lamp I've ordered off Amazon, and I'm disappointed with this one as well. I ordered a very similar lamp a couple weeks ago and this lamp has the same exact problem. I suspect they are made in the same factory. Like the other lamp I ordered this one leans to one side... a lot (see pics). I had to physically bend the pole/tubing on that one so it would stand semi-straight, I'll have to do the same to this one. Shipping was fast, assembly was easy, but I cannot recommend this lamp for the price. I understand they're inexpensive, but I don't think it's unreasonable to expect a floor lamp to stand straight no matter how much you pay for it.",

                "reviewText": "The metal frame of this lamp is decently constructed. Simple twist on assembly, and the rod-iron like metal is very sturday. The shade this lamp comes with isn't great. It's got some fraying that is very easy to see at the top and bottom of the frame. Little hairs of the linen stick out. Doesn't look clean. The most frustrating part is how to adjust the brightness. It does 3 brightness settings, but you have to turn it off between each setting. 1 click for bright, then next click is off, then next click is medium, then next click is off, the next click is warm. So from turning it on to warm, i have to click 5 times. If you do get this lamp, I highly recommend getting a smart bulb and be done with it. I would never want to use the button that it comes with. I still give it 3 stars because the frame looks great, and it'll be functional with a smart bulb...but I'm closer to 2.5 stars because of the hairy shade and poor power button.",

Love the foot control, I feel it\u2019s easier than fumbling for a tiny swich especially for seniors.
