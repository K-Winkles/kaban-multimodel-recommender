They also arrived next day. I do not like the outside...with the light on. Buying in looks white, buy with light on it looks like finish has crackef and it looks like black cracks in finish.

This simplyndoesn\u2019t fit the style. But it does thr work damn good. No heat whatsoever. The LED lights recommended are perfect.. I did sit it on a tiny white saucer from another decorative item I bought in Paris. It fits the hole on the bottom( where you reach in to screw the bulb into its socket) perfectly but not needed. I have two other lamps in the room. one on my desk across the room in a tiny cul de sac and on the other side of my bed. I need neither with this light, but if all three are on, its not too bright. . The light is not too bright alone. It has small clicker on the cord to turn it off and on. I like the product... the price for both the box of 4 bulbs and the lamp was $50.

                "reviewText": "I love this lamp. The handcrafted look is very unique and complements any style. I was disappointed with the candelabra bulb socket; a 40W incandescent candelabra bulb made it heat up and smell a bit of chemicals. This is because any bulb heat is trapped inside of the sphere and against whatever it's sitting on.I was able to swap in a standard bulb socket from the local hardware store ($3) after a little struggling to remove the included socket (they used loctite or similar on the screw threads). If you do this, DON'T USE A HIGHER-WATTAGE BULB as it will overheat the lamp. I'm using a low-wattage LED smart bulb and I love how every color looks when shining through the broken-glass shell.This would be a 5/5 if they used a standard socket by default, but I guess there are liability or fit issues to consider, as the full-size bulb sits a little off-center due to its height.",

You get a pretty light during the day, and for the evening, you get a nightlight that's bright enough to help you see where you're going without being so bright as to make it hard to fall back asleep.I don't like tuning on lights in the bathroom at night unless it's absolutely necessary, and this was a great replacement for another globe light I'd had since forever. It takes a standard candelabra bulb. I've got a LED bulb which I transferred from my old light, so it'll last for many, many years with continuous running (the bulb I'm using is over 5 years old at this point).The teal is beautiful, and the photo with my review was taken in daylight in a bathroom that never really gets direct sun, so what you see is the level of lighting all the time. I'm planning to redo the decor in my bathroom, and I'm using this lamp as the springboard for colors.",
