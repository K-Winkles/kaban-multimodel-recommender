                "reviewText": "I would have given it a higher rating if all the pieces were included. Missing 12 little crystal threads to hang the bigger crystals on. Too much hassle to re-pack the entire lamp now that it is almost put together. Ordering replacement crystal from Ebay to fix the problem instead. Also the shade is really black instead of the chocolate color represented. Otherwise a nice looking lamp.",

It was a little bit of a pain to put together because the instructions are put on the flap of the box, but omg totally worth the like hour spent putting it together trying to find all of the tiny rings for it that fell out in the box. I can't wait until the second one arrives next week!!!!!!",
