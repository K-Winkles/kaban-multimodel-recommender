This lamp lights up the corner in a very unobtrusive way. You can't even see it in my photo but I have it pointing toward the walls to provide ambient light. It comes with an inline switch for on/off, warm and cool light. I prefer the cool, white light, but there's also a setting for a mix of both. Now, if I can just find the timer I bought for the power strip I have it plugged into, I'll be totally set because I can't reach the switch. I just leave it on for now; since it's LED I'm not worried about it.",

                "reviewText": "The lamp works perfectly well; it has three lighting mode (white, warm, and soft white) and then you have the option to dim it from low light to bright light. I noticed people complaining about how you can\u2019t adjust the dimness or that it\u2019s too bright, and frankly,that seems to be user error because it dims just fine. You need to hold your finger on the power button, not pressing it, holding it. It will dim the lighting to dark and you can lift your finger and hold it again to get it brighter.The lamp is very sleek and very clean, and fits the aesthetic I was aiming for. I think people need to read the manual in order to place such criticism. I do agree that it would be nice if it came with a remote or that the cord wasn\u2019t placed where it is, because I like having the lamp face the wall for an ambient feeling and the cord placement is an eyesore.",

This lamp is absolutely perfect. The base is nice and thin and the light is sleek. Assembly was super easy, just screw the light portion into the base and plug it in. There are multiple light settings and I love that it\u2019s dimmable. I use the warm light and face the light towards the wall, it adds light without being harsh or having to stare at a bright strip. I\u2019m very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a minimal sleek light.",
