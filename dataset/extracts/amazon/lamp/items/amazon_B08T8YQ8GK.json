                "reviewText": "This lamp has quickly become an indispensable part of my home decor. The convenience of this battery-operated lamp is truly remarkable. I can place it anywhere without being constrained by the need for a power outlet. Whether it's on my bedside table, my reading nook, or even outdoors during a cozy evening, this lamp provides the perfect amount of ambient light without the hassle of cords. The design of the lamp is both sleek and charming. The compact size allows it to fit seamlessly into any space, and the quality of the materials is evident in its construction. What I appreciate most about this lamp is its portability. It's easy to carry from room to room or even take it along for outdoor activities like camping or picnics. The fact that it's not tethered to an outlet makes it a versatile lighting solution. It does take batteries which are NOT included, but that is not a huge issue. I love this lamp and highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I have been scouring Amazon for weeks to try to find a cordless lamp for my primary bathroom. Essentially for lighting at night when I come upstairs to go to bed. I find that the overhead vanity light is so blaringly right that it's hard for me to see after I shut it off. This beautiful lamp is exactly what I needed. I did see that if you put in a promo code they would send you a free bulb which I did receive and appreciate but much to my surprise when I open the box there was already a bulb included. So yay! I love the timer feature! The 6 hours on 18 hours off is perfect. The lamp seems of high quality for the price I paid. I'm going to consider buying a few more for other spaces in my house as the reflection from the glass is very pretty. Will definitely buy again in hope that it lasts for quite some time.",

Next, the negatives: I wanted the device to cast a subtle, diffused light that would be relaxing and pretty to look at. The bulb is so bright it dominates the appearance of the light. I see the bulb shining through the pretty glass shade. I don't see the glass shade enhanced by a soft light.The issue could be fixed with a warm white bulb that is not so \"In your face.\" I could not find a bulb on Amazon that was guaranteed to work. I note that other customers tried a different bulb, but did not work.If you want a soft glow, do not purchase this lamp!",

                "reviewText": "I received my green lamp today! It was impeccably packaged to avoid breakage. I was very pleased with that. The green color (not the light green option) is perfect. People need to realize that these cordless/battery-operated lamps will dim as the batteries wear down. I only use rechargeable batteries which save a boatload of money. Don't assume that when the light that's emitted over time becomes dimmer and dimmer that there is a defect. It's time to change or recharge the batteries. Normally, my other battery-operated/timer lights last approximately 30 days. Since I just received mine today, I will update you later as to how long it was before I changed the batteries. People NEED TO READ THE PRODUCT/BULB description. You just can't use any LED bulb in this lamp. You MUST BUY ONE OF THEIR BULBS. It is clearly written, so don't be upset to find out that the bulb you purchased to replace it won't work. I purchased the smaller version as opposed to the larger one. The only difference is the width of the lamp. They both stand the same height of 10 or so inches. The small is a nice size. The time you turn it on will be the time it will turn on each night. It will say on for 6 hours and will remain off for 18 hours. IT DOES NOT GO ON WHEN IT GETS DARK by itself. Again, read the product description. It will tell you exactly what to expect. I can't wait to use it for the first time tonight. We'll see how it goes. Right now I'm highly recommending it. UPDATE: After turning it on for the first time, I thought the light was much too bright for my liking. I knew after the batteries got weaker it would look better to me. Well after 10 days it was time to change the batteries. I was hoping they would last a month. Then again, I didn't use Duracell's or expensive batteries. So my advice is INVEST IN RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES, I did! This still is a nice lamp.",

The globe is plastic but doesn\u2019t look cheap and the green gives a nice touch of color in our room. I would recommend purchasing for the price if you are looking for a battery operated light.",
