                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic lamp! Lots of bright light for art-making or crafts.",
                "reviewText": "I was very skeptical about this lamp, as I have been using old-school lamps (Luxo Lumaglow, anyone?) for illuminating my art table for as long as I can remember. These were/are the jointed, adjustable architect's lamps that clamp on to your work table. I have gone through quite a few across the years, and I have one old faithful left. It has a ceramic socket, so I can use a 100 watt bulb in there and not worry the socket is going to melt if I leave it lit for hours- which I tend to do. I buy full-spectrum \"daylight\" bulbs to use in these lamps. This kind of lamp was the old standby in the artist's studio, and was all I knew, so when I went shopping for a new lamp for my workspace, I felt a bit like I was awakening from a 30 year coma.What the heck *were* these lamps? They didn't even have BULBS. And they had- remote controls? How ridiculous is that? And what were all the settings about? I was used to turning on a lamp, and having it produce light at the same magnitude and temperature every time. So I was pretty lost when it came to picking out one of these new-fangled art/craft lamps. I did a bunch of research, and found that my desired light level was 6500K, and that these new lamps provided full spectrum, true white light which is so crucial for seeing colors in an accurate way.This particular model of lamp was recommended in articles I found by Googling \"best lamp for artists,\" and it had very good reviews here on Amazon (thanks, guys!) It was a reasonable price, and from its description, seems like it will have a long life. When it arrived, though, I was skeptical. The lamp felt flimsy. But it turned out it is just well-made, and not as clunky as my old architect's lamps. In fact, I was in for a lot of nice surprises regarding my new purchase.Assembly was easy- and I really hate putting things together. But putting this lamp together was way less hassle even than screwing the clamp that holds the body of an architect's lamp on to the table, then sinking the little pipe at the bottom of the lamp into the hole in the clamp. This Luckystyle Floor Lamp was also so much more maneuverable than my old lamp. And, it was lighter. I soon found out that it also gave out an amount of light greater than my 100 watt full-spectrum bulb.And the remote control? It's fun! And it makes cycling through all of the light \"settings\" easy. I clicked around before I found the two settings I would always be using- the brightest intensities, and one with a more blue cast to it. I defaulted to a \"neutral\" light temperature at the highest setting, and that is throwing a more than adequate amount light onto my work table. But I appreciate being able to perceive what I am working on at various light levels.The base of this lamp, though not heavy, is stable, and the easily adjustable neck holds any \"pose\" you put the lamp into. The lamp does not get hot and burn my fingers when I go to adjust it, the way my old lamp still does. It also takes up a minimum amount of room in my studio, and I can easily lift it to move it with my left hand, and I am an older, small woman. I really appreciate as well that it is a floor lamp, so it doesn't take up room on my art table.So now- the same way I think of my cell phone- I don't know how we got along without this kind of lamp!Pros: nice bright light, can change the temperature and brightness level of the light easily, lots of light settings to choose from, lamp is easy to move around and adjust, lightweight but well-made, stable base, even on a crumply tarp on the floor, remote control is very handy for changing light settings and turning the lamp off and on, no need to worry the lamp is getting too hot to touch.Cons: I now want MORE of these lamps!If you are an older person like me and not familiar with these kind of lamps, you are going to be super pleased with how easy this lamp is to use, and at the volume of light it puts out. A must for doing crafts, or painting, or puzzle assembling, or drawing, or collaging, or whatever it is that you like to do. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "I love this lamp!I was needing a reading lamp for my bedside so have this one a shot - mainly because I could change the color temperature of the lamp and adjust the brightness. I found this one to be fantastic.Pros:- Price- Adjustable temperature and brightness levels- Fully adjustable gooseneck- Adequate weighted base- Fully functioning remote- Small factor power supply doesn't block outlet- Sleep timer for auto shut-off- Compact/smart packaging in a much smaller box than you'd expectCons:- Remote sticks magnetically to pole, but that magnet is weak so I find myself knocking the remote off constantly (I just don't store it there anymore)- The only two buttons on the lamp itself is power and color temp change. I don't adjust the color temp often so would've preferred a brightness adjustment on the pole instead. The only way to adjust brightness is to find the remote and do it that way.Overall, a great lamp that I use beside for reading and one for taking pics of resell items in my \"studio.\" And because it's LED, I expect this to last for many years! It met my needs perfectly, so I recommend this to my friends all the time!",

Maybe I have cataracts. Works well uses very little electricity LED lights are great. Worth the money came packaged well easy to assemble and works. I don\u2019t really use the remote, but some people would but the button on the pole works perfect. And I always use it in the highest bright white light mode so don\u2019t use the demos myself.",

                "reviewText": "Well made, upright tubes don't strip with assembly, heavy stand base, unlimited angles of of lamp direction - LOTS of light quality control I have never experienced before!Rheostat is a fairly common feature these days, but I have never had a reading lamp with \"White Balance\" [color temperature] control. It has three main settings - 6500\u00b0K [brighter, harsher than daylight], 4500\u00b0K [like an incandescent bulb] and a 300\u00b0K setting [lower, \"warmer\" than incandescent bulbs]. For me, the lowest setting is the easiest on my eyes for reading. The 6500\u00b0K may come in handy for tiny text, or somewhat obscured details. If you have ever noticed the newer car headlights with a very harsh brightness, almost blue in color, that would be an example of 6500\u00b0K color temperature. Brighter than sunlight, which is only 5600\u00b0K. Flat screen computer monitors have \"White Balance\" controls.The K stands for \"Kelvin\", the measurement standard for light. The higher the temp, the harsher the light and harder on the eyes.In short, this the best overall reading lamp I ever owned.",
