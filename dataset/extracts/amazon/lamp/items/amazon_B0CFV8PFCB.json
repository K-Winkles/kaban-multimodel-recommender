(1) my last lamp, while bright, it\u2019s highest brightness would be comparable to a 3 out of 5 with this one. (2) I also like that it has easy accessibility to buttons, which are on the pole vs the old one that has a sensor on top. It is stable & stays in place vs the old being top heavy. (3) I caught it on sale so I basically paid the same for both. I plan on buying 2 more for Christmas gifts. Right now with the holiday sales on is THE TIME TO BUY! Good luck.",

                "reviewText": "If you want a bright lamp, this is for you! Blindingly bright really. Although you can dim it, it\u2019s not what I call dim. It does have three color temperatures, which is nice. I like the controls on the stand part. That\u2019s very convenient. The gooseneck part goes up and down, but not side to side. The RGB is nice, if that\u2019s your thing. My biggest complaint is that the base is not really heavy enough to keep it from falling over if bumped. If I had it to do over, I\u2019d buy a different style. Just my opinion.",

It has a great look, the goose nech, various color level and goose neck to position it was exactly what I needed. Well I bought it and found it was simple to coonect the pole sections and the base. Plugged it in and use the touch sensor loated on the pole to turn it on and set the level of lighhting you want.. Wow I was more that pleased with this light! Would highly reommed this fixture for those who could use a stand alone, easy to install and sensor control pole light.",

But the biggest drawback - if you move the gooseneck back and forth at all, the pole that connects to the base becomes loose, requiring constant correction. This apparently strained the thin electrical wire and the light no longer works. So, maybe not so economical at all\u2026..",

The main light is what they advertise. I'd love the lamp if it hadn't have been misleading regarding the limited rgb functionality. I'm not sure if I'm going to keep it or send it back....
