                "reviewText": "I received my lamp on Monday. It was very easy to assemble until I got to the next to last step. The screw ring that was supposed to attach the lamp shade to the lamp head was missing. I emailed their customer service at 7 that evening. They replied before midnight to ask for my Amazon ID number for the purchase. I sent it and some time before 3 am that night they replied to say they had begun the process of sending me a replacement. On Wednesday, less than 48 hours from my original email, I received the missing part. I easily finished the assembly. Setting it up to work with my Alexa was a breeze. You had to download an app to your phone, , register your lamp in the app, then link the app and your Alexa account. The lamp works great, responds to voice commands through Alexa, and the story has a happy ending. They are a small business who responded swiftly, personally, and appropriately to the situation. It was a far cry from the big companies I've had to deal with recently. I heartily recommend them and their product.",

The lamp itself is ok, little top heavy and we had to weight down the other side just to make sure it doesn't tip over accidentally. None of us could get the app to connect to the smart bulb, and before you ask, yes, we know our WiFi password. We just put a 100 watt bulb in it and will use it like a regular lamp I guess. He does like that it brightened his house path. So, for a floor lamp, I give it 3 stars.",
