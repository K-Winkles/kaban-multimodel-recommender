Then the floor lamp flickers which means the pairing is successful.\"1H\" for one hour auto-off: Every time you click the button, the timer will restart. If you want to stop the one-hour setting, turn off the lamp and turn it on again.The central button on the remote is a one-key switch to the light setting of 4000K color temperature and 100% brightness.

                "reviewText": "We had a floor lamp that sits behind the couch. My SO constantly complained that he could see the lamps reflection in the TV, which ruined the view for him. That, and the lamp was getting to the point of replacement, just in general.I spotted this and immediately thought it was the perfect solution. While it takes some assembly (a bit of which was not immediately apparent) - it is a joy to use. (It took me about 10 minutes to assembly, but mainly because I was confused for a bit on the proper method).First, the top section is split and each can be independently turned to point at the ceiling, behind, or forward (or anywhere in between). Very nice for getting the lighting where you want.It also has a reading lamp - which I figured my SO would hate (but I would find useful), but my SO actually likes it as well.The temperature (color) and intensity (brightness) of both the top lamp and reading lamp are adjustable through several levels.The lamp is controlled by two switches on the pole itself (which can be a bit tricky to get exactly what you want dialed in) - but it also comes with a remote, which is a joy to use. The left side controls the top lamp and the right side controls the reading lamp. Easy to understand buttons.The best feature of the remote is that it has a magnetic back - and sticks quite nicely to the lamp (just about anywhere), keeping it always easy to find and use.Great lamp that solved a number of problems for us!",

                "reviewText": "The lamps were exactly what I wanted. I was looking for a good floor lamp with white or blue light to light up my living room, which is also more or less my office. The regular red lights in my apartment are dim, and don't provide enough light for someone who works nights and rarely if ever gets to make use of natural sunlight.I was encouraged by other reviews to give these lamps a try, and I like their rotatable design a lot. They don't just look cool, they also help me get the light right where a need it depending on whether or not I'm working at the computer, or sitting on the couch doing crocheting when I'm not busy.Ratings (keep in mind that I have two.)Brightness: 5/5Almost as good as natural light through my glass doors during the day. Helps keep me peppy through the night.Assembly: 4/5Easy assembly. You just need to unpack it and screw everything together. The power cord is already run through the segments, so you just need to line them up properly and screw them in, then unite the lamp rod with the base. The hardest part about putting these lights together was cutting through the little plastic baggies protecting the rod segments. Not really sure why they bothered to waste the plastic, honestly. Maybe to keep the Styrofoam packing from clinging to the rods?IMPORTANT! BATTERIES FOR THE REMOTE ARE NOT INCLUDED! You need (2) AAA batteries for each remote!Ease of use: 3.9/5The little instruction booklet is pretty bad. Basically one page in several languages showing you how the lamp screws together, and nothing on the remote's functions. That said, it's pretty easy to figure out if you play with it for a moment.To save you some time, the remote has two power buttons, one for the main lamp head and one for the reading lamp head. Beneath these buttons are a series of functions you can swap through for each lamp head. The main lamp head buttons are directly below its power button, and vice versa. Lets you adjust the brightness of the lamp, and the color of the light from each. You can adjust each lamp head to a unique setting independent of each other.The remote controllers are magnetic, too, so that's kind of cool.",

The flexible ring light is excellent for reading in a chair and useful for Zoom meetings. The other ring light is great for general room lighting or display of wall art.I have the lamp in my law office by my reading chair and it is elegant, smart looking, small and easy to use. The remote feature means I can turn it on and off from my desk across the room and is very useful. After having the floor lamp in my office for over 3 months now I can tell you that it is a fantastic lamp and better than any other lamp I have ever owned or seen in another office or home. Buy it.",

                "reviewText": "I originally bought this lamp in June of 2023 for its height, style, and options. The design and functionality were well thought out, and we are happy with it. I did experience an issue with an electronic problem with the original lamp, so I contacted FIMEI, and they really were helpful and stood by their product. We determined that a replacement was necessary and they sent one right out. I am happy to have the replacement in plac, sinc I still love the function and look of it. It is very bright and easy to use.",

                "reviewText": "PROS:- Fantastic modern stylish FIMEI LED floor lamp!- Easy to assemble within 5 minutes and I didn't even bother with the instructions.- SAFETY FEATURE - The LED's are cold to lukewarm to the touch depending on the brightness level which makes this a much safer lamp option than traditional torchiere lamps with very hot halogen filaments or bulbs (and there is no light hum or buzzing either like halogen lamps typically have, particularly when dimmed).- The dual LED torchiere lamp and reading light are very bright and have numerous settings for brightness, dimming, as well as warm white or cooler white light options to suit your taste.- Remote control is simple to operate with separate buttons for the torchiere lamp as well as the reading lamp, so they can be switched on and off or have their brightness or colour settings adjusted INDEPENDENTLY which is very convenient and impressive.- Button panel area on the lamp pole has soft blue light illumination, so you can locate the lamp in the dark and that panel is magnetic to attach the remote for safekeeping.- Nice heavy metal base for this lamp which should keep it sturdy provided your flooring/carpeting is level.- Packed well in Styrofoam in its box with protective plastic wrapping for all parts to prevent damage.CONS:None. This lamp is outstanding!OVERALL RATING:A+ for style and function. This was a great purchase and I purchased two more recently when they were on sale. This lamp far exceeded my expectations.",

They worked with me to resolve it and the lamp works 100% as per description. Thank you Iris !!!Happy with this purchase and it far exceeded my expectation, I would definitely buy it again.",

                "reviewText": "The tone options are very nice to have on both lights and the dimers have a wide range of options. You can use the remote to change anything and turn it on and off, both lights are controlled separately. You can twist the top lights in any positions (360 both) manually. The lamp buttons (touch bar style) allow you to change the light tone with a single touche and dim it if you stay on it (same for top and bottom lamp).Very easy to assemble, stable and not heavy. Looks very good!Only downside is that if you are not using the remote and try to turn off the lamp using the touch bouton (more like a touch bar), you have to push 4 times to go through all the tones and then it turns off, while the remote has an on/off button. If there is this option and I haven't found it feel free to indicate it!",
