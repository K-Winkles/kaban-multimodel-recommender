Pairing the remote was easy, but someone unplugged the lamp and the remote no longer worked. I found you can re-pair the remote by unplugging the lamp. Hold down the power button on the remote, while holding down the power button on the remote, plug the lamp back into the outlet, wait a second or so and the lamp flashes indicating successful pairing. I was so happy to have the remote working again! Great lamp, the remote makes it much better as you don't have to cycle through all the color temperatures if you like one in particular.",

                "reviewText": "I bought a pair of these lamps to place in the back corners of our TV room, to provide some ambient lighting, and personal lighting if needed. These lamps were easy to set up, look very modern and nice (if a little on the small side), and provide a great amount of adjustment to get just the right color and level of lighting in the room. And the personal lamps are equally functional.The remotes were a bit small and flimsy--the \"control panel\" insert fell off one of them, but some glue will fix it. And at this modest price, what should you expect? The touch controls on the pole will make do when my teens have inevitably lost the remotes anyway.In short, I got more than my money's worth, and I'm very happy with the results.",

                "reviewText": "Have used the lamp for a bit now and have to say it has exceeded my expectations. It is sleek and takes up very little space. Love that I can change the hue to what is suitable to my needs/mood. It gets pretty bright on its brightess setting and even feels up my bigger living room with light completely if I don't rotate the head of the lamp, but can also spotlight an area even brighter if you swivel the head accordingly. Has been excellent for when we play board games or work puzzles. Also, on a lower setting is perfect to just \"leave a light on\" or to add ambience to a room. Even the smaller reading lamp adds a pretty good bit of light even when on a softer, lower setting. The remote is nice. Lamp sits across from my living room so remote in console in the couch so we can turn on from across the room without getting up. The on/off on the remote has been a little tricky. Sometimes I can press lightly and it works, but other times I notice I have to hold down or push a couple of times before it will work. It will work well, just seems odd that it does not seem to be consistent. My one drawback and why I did not give this 5 stars...when you have a power failure and the power comes back on, the light comes on too. Typically, if one has a light off when the power goes out, they want it off when the power is restored too. Especially if this happens in middle of the night when we are all asleep but have to get up to turn the lamp back off when power is restored. Perhaps not so bad if lamp beside your bed where you can just reach out and turn it back off, but when the light from the living room is shining in your bedroom in middle of the night, this means getting out of bed and walking across the house to do so. Perhaps it was meant to be a courtesy to make sure you are not left in the dark when power is restored. That could be a nice feature, but for me would be nice if I could turn this feature off.",

Turning it on and seeing my mint green walls come alive from the reflected ceiling light is very satisfying.Assembly is awkward. My recommendation is to lay the pieces on a long table to make assembly easier.This is an awesome lamp. You can set it to dim or crank it up to blazingly bright, then choose the degree of warmth: pure white (brings out the color of you walls) to sunny yellow. It can illuminate a large space or adapt to a small one.The quality is quite good. The remote is very reliable. My only complaint is that I would like obvious button labels (probably just my issue).I recommend this lamp.",

                "reviewText": "I had read a lot of reviews but I never saw anyone report their remote didn't work because apparently the battery is dead. I can only assume this because after repeated times of removing battery and re-installing, no light ever came on the remote, which the directions said was first step to pairing. I like the lamp, it works without the remote but still when one buys a product new, there is an expectation that it will work. Way too much trouble to package it up and order a replacement or get a refund. So now I must buy the small 12v battery and see it that is actually the problem, rather than a faulty remote. Now I am re-submitting my review and changed it to a five star. A new battery worked, remote works fine, using the switches on the pole are also easy. The different hues lend a pleasant ambiance and the reading light is just what I needed when sitting in my recliner. This 77 year old gal is happy!",

I like the numerous settings and main indirect light on top. The remote helps as I can adjust light across the room. The three settings for light from cool to warm is a nice feature. The reading lamp works the same. And I like that the lamp remembers what your last setting was when you turn it back on.The lamp is thin and modern and is not intrusive in the living room. The remote has a magnet so can stick to the metal frame out of the way (less chance to misplace).It was worth the wait when it finally arrived (delayed over the Christmas season due to high volume of packages). I have been slowly replacing all of the lights in my house with LED lights, so this is a welcome addition.",

So I had been looking for floor lamp for bright cool day light for quite a while.This lamp took me around 15 minutes to assemble. Quite simple. You can do it even without an instruction guide. It has a total 4 choices of light warmth. And I prefer cool day light, of course. And I can also adjust the brightness for each warmth.
