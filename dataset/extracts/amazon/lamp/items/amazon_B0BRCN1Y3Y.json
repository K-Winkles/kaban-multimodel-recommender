                "reviewText": "This lamp seems very simple in actual construction (as most lamps surprisingly are), but every piece has its own ornate detail that gives it that expensive look. The first thing I noticed was the feather tassel at the bottom of the light had to be hooked on...which is awesome! That means you can easily replace it with your own little lamp charm! I'll be keeping the feather, but it is a great option to have. The only thing I struggled with as far as putting the lamp together was the wire. I could not get it fed all the way through the neck of the lamp so I have a bit of it showing up at the top. While it doesn't bother me that much, it I think it would definitely look better fed all the way through...which I will continue to mess with again later. The bottom of the lamp is sealed off by a foam plate that I was afraid of breaking through when trying to feed the wire down. I do wish that piece was removable for that reason but again, hardly a big deal at all.I love the 3 different tones of light the lamp offers. Each time you turn the lamp off and back on, it switches modes, so you might have to turn your lamp on 3 times haha. Worth it for the feature in my opinion. Kudos for coming with a lightbulb too. :) Overall, this was a great buy and I am so happy I finally broke down and got one. Also, look at those colors! These lamps are just...perfect.The only downside I'm seeing about said lamps are that replacement glass costs almost as much as a new lamp. The glass is easily switched out if you're into seasonal decor and what not without owning several full lamps. Oh, and don't put the lamp in any unstable or shaky area or where it may be bumped often. It could possibly slip off the hanger it dangles from.",

It's easy to take the feather off the bottom if you like - the wire just bends out. Assembling was simple. If you find excess cord at the top, just unscrew the arm from the base a bit and you can pull the excess cord through. I'm very happy to see that the stained glass effect was not just photoshopped in the product pictures! You can put the glass on either way so I can choose between blue side up or or orange!",

Not too overbearing or sparse. The globe was packaged perfectly so there was no issue with any damage. The assembly took 3 minutes. If you have ever assembled a pole lamp, you got this down-packed. It\u2019s a beautiful ambient light. The base is very solid. The metal is beautiful and not silver like some pics show. I sort of wish I would have gotten the red one but I am very happy with this purchase. Whoever is designing these, you are very talented.",
