                "reviewText": "This floor lamp is great because you can choose exactly how cool or warm the light is, or how bright or dim it is. The \"nighttime\" setting is just the lowest level of brightness, and it's still enough light to see by, but not too much to relax. The head tilts pretty much any which way you might want it to, so you can aim it right at the ceiling, right at the wall, or anywhere in between. It might be a little bit of a learning curve to put it together the first time, but once you get the hang of it, it's easy. Tip: work your way up to the top when screwing the pipe sections together.",
