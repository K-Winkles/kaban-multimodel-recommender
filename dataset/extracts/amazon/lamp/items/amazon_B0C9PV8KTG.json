                "reviewText": "One of my favorite purchases for my office is the Raven Lamp that offers a stylish and unique look to my workspace. It's always a great conversation piece along with the light it provides. Beyond its aesthetic appeal, the Raven Lamp is simple but boasts impressive functionality. Emitting a soft, ambient glow, it creates an atmosphere of serenity and contemplation, whether one seeks a gentle glow for late-night reading or a luminous beacon to chase away the shadows.",

                "reviewText": "I am in love with this little lamp. I adore crows so when I saw this I had to buy it. I was worried about if it would be good quality. It is! The crow is very life like and sized and I switched out the light bulb for a color changing smart bulb. It s nice it comes with a light bulb and I will use that one at a later date. If you are unsure about this, do not hesitate. You will be so happy with it!",

                "reviewText": "I liked everything about this little lamp except the crow looked cheap with its solid black coating. I decided to jazz him up a bit. Lightly sanded the whole thing and sprayed layer by layer with spray paint- first metallic silver, then oil rubbed bronze, then mists of semi glass black. Once it was thoroughly dry, I painted beak, neck, and some wing parts with metallic blue and purple nail polish. Eyes became dark red. Went over some areas (especially yellow on beak) with metallic bronze nail polish to make it look more natural. Then protected it with clear satin varnish overall. Very happy with the result!",

No. But this is the going rate. It\u2019s pretty light, but sturdy. The cord is a little stiff but it will probably loosen up. It is almost the size of a real crow..I like that. The biggest problem is the bulb is so damn bright. You can\u2019t have it on and in front of you. I will try to find a dimmer bulb. I think I will keep it. Someone said in a review that it didn\u2019t have a USA STANDARD OUTLET PLUG\u2026That isn\u2019t true..IT DOES!! The cord fits tightly in the crows beak. It\u2019s not perfect but it\u2019s a cool little lamp. >Just get a dimmer bulb!<",
