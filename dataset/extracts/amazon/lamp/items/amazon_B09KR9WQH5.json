The remote is excellent and provides several different modes of light on both mother and daughter light fixtures.This is an excellent floor lamp which will be able to provide the bright, white intensity or the soft amber glow when the light of either light fixture is turned down. FIVE STARS\u2026.. Very simple to assemble!Update:Although we love the lamp, one of the bulbs went on the fritz after one week (and we followed all directions to see if we could sync the lightbulb with the remote.... we had no success. We would appreciate if the seller can arrange the shipping of an additional light bulb. I will update.....Update: Reduce my review by 3 stars. This company is impossible to deal with. They would not replace the A14 LED bulb (which no longer worked after 1 week). They told me to replace with a regular bulb which is unacceptable. Other reviewers have had the same issue with this lamp. So simply: BUYER BEWARE!!!",

                "reviewText": "I bought 2 of these, for rooms where there is no central ceiling light. The brightness functions and warmth of light features are GREAT! And I bought these because I wanted a remote control and bright lights.HOWEVER. On one of them the bigger light started going on the fritz within 2 months. I replaced the bulb, nothing. Eventually it no longer worked with the remote, and the fix on the website didn't work. So now you can no longer control the light brightness or coloring, because there is no manual button for that. And I can only get it to turn on/off by walking over and turning the knob on the lamp. That's inconvenient when I bought the light to be able to be turned on from the doorway of a dark room. I am hoping the other light does not do the same, but I will wait and see. So the one that works, I love! The one that went rogue...is kinda useless now, since I can't access the brightness or color features--just on/off. Thankfully, Amazon refunded me for that one. If you get this, assemble it and use it right away so you will know if you got a dud!",
