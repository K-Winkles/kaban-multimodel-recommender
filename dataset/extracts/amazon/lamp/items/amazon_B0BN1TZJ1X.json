It's really easy to assemble the remote control works great the app that comes with the lamp doesn't work or I don't know how to make it work but all in all it's a very nice lamp dose all kinds of different light colors I use the middle pice of the light on the red setting at night so I can see well enough to find the remote when I have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night it would be a perfect night light for kids that need a night light and with both lamps going at full blast it will light up the whole room it has different modes where it changes color and it can change colors slowly or really fast I gave my self a seizure by accident when I was checking out the different modes there two buttons on the remote control that I still don't know what they do h1 and h2 they seem to shut off the light for s couple of seconds other than that I have no idea what there function is. It's a pretty great lamp with different light level controls so you can set the light to what ever amount of light that you desire. All in all it a pretty nice light I highly recommend you buying one for yourself",

                "reviewText": "As a college student, this is the perfect light to add some ambient lighting to my space. My main issue is that the colored lights are way, way dimmer than the cool-to-warm white-light setting. As a result, you cannot see any of the colored lighting unless it is completely dark in the room. You can easily control it from an app on your phone, although there are in-app advertisements. I love how it reflects the light off of the ceiling because I think the indirect lighting fills my room better. Yes, I know it is pricey for a college student but I think it is definitely worth the cost. I rarely use my room's fluorescent lights now. It was easy to assemble and hopefully easy to disassemble at the end of the year. It was pleasantly taller than I was expecting, but that's my fault for not checking the dimensions. I've recommended this light to my many friends who ask.",

                "reviewText": "I typically do not write reviews but this product deserves a full 5 star review! I would give it more stars if I could! I just returned from an 8 day holiday trip. I didn't realize that in my mad dash to the airport, I left this light on. When I came home, I saw that I left this light on. My heart dropped and I fully expected to see burn marks or worse! To my suprise, there was absolutely no heat coming from the light at all! Thank God!! Overall, I really like the different lighting options and how bright and colorful this lamp is. The magnetic remote is an added bonus. Buy this product! (Note: I'm not recommending to leave the lamp on and unattended for 8 days straight but know that it's safe if mistakes happen.)",

                "reviewText": "Just put it together. Overall, seems good for the price.Pros:Construction/materials feel and look high quality and overall the lamp looks great. Colors, whites, and brightness seem good (not sure what to compare the brightness with for this sort of lamp---not quite as bright as my TV led strip lights). Haven't tried the app yet, but the remote feels nice and the magnet is nice. I can't give an fair assessment on the ease of use for the remote, since I haven't played with it much.Con (only one, as of now, but a big one):The QR code sticker on the face of the lamp itself!! Dude! It is stuck on flush, it is like a nanometer thick, and has no pull tab. I tried with my fingernail, I tried with a plastic edge, and no luck. Finally, I used a brand new, sharp razor blade. This *worked*, however, residue is left and I also dug into the lamp face plastic just a bit, enough to make a superficial scratch (I was really trying to be careful; I was a finish carpenter for 10 years in my younger days).I would like to purchase this light for another family member (I almost purchased two this time; glad I didn't yet). I don't want to do so, until I hear the company addresses the QR sticker on the lamp face. I mean, seriously, this seems like an unnecessary headache and blemish-in-waiting on an otherwise great looking and functioning lamp.",

                "reviewText": "My roommate and I have agreed to disagree on what temperature of lighting is best around the house. Before it devolved into changing out the bulbs every time we wanted the light our way, this solved the problem. It's got a great range of shades, dimming settings, and direction. It's so nice to be able to have bright light for when I'm working and also have soft gentle light when I need to get up at night. I also have chronic migraines and after reading a recent paper I decided to experiment with green light. This lamp provides and it does make things much more tolerable. Getting a whole lamp with many more functions for roughly the same price as a quality color bulb, I'm very happy with this.My only concern with it is that sometimes when it's bright it gets an uncanny feel like with LED flickering. It's definitely not the worst and is very subtle so it's tolerable.",
