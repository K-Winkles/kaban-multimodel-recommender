It probably would've been quicker with two people or someone tall. It is perfect for our bedroom and very bright. I also appreciated that bulbs were included. Getting the three LED bulbs made this a clear choice. It is a great little lamp for the value.Concern: Slightly tilted, but I might try reassembling or tightening some of the joints. The socket seemed a bit loose, but all of the bulbs work.",

I wish the upright lamp had higher wattage. Of course, that can be fixed by replacing the bulb, but that is my reason, the main reason, for giving 4 stars instead of five. This assumes the bulbs supplied have a normal LED lifetime.",
