I didn't expect it will be valuable to me. But it was extremely valuable. For me, if any book, speak or video gives you a tool that can change your behavior, habit and make you better that is valuable. Lia's book has some simple easy to use tools and I have started using it - such as watching English movies, listening to English songs which I was not doing lately or watching rarely.Also reading a book with son at bedtime - I used to do earlier but now I do with the intention to learn/improve my pronunciation.So yes, Must book for a speaker, leader, BD, Marketing especially someone whose English is a secondary language. Thank you, Lia !!!",
