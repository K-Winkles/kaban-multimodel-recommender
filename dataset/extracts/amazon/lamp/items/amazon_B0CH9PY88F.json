                "reviewText": "I bought 2 of these lamps to sit on top of a king size bookcase headboard. Just the right size. Lamp shades were easy to construct and instead of uno style they actually had a harp to allow for adjustments. They were heavy and well constructed. For bulbs, I added Sengled 100 watt equivalent color bluetooth bulbs paired with an Echo Dot so I could voice control via Alexa the off & on, color, brightness, and temperature. These lamps look expensive but were easy on the wallet.",
