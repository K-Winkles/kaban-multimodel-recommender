                "reviewText": "Very lightweight but sturdy lamp that looks elegant and is very useful to light up a dark room and focus light on a work space. I was surprised when it arrived in a rather small box but it went together very easily and is remarkably nice looking for such a simple lamp. The two globes are plastic so we'll see how they last. Right now they look like glass and transmit light perfectly well. I must say that I am very satisfied with the product and also with the hard to beat price.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this lamp for my family member who had to move into a memory care facility where they requested non-glass lamps for safety. The lamp arrived on time and was well-packaged, with very basic \"screw the parts together\" instructions that anyone could follow. The problem I ran into was that the threaded inserts the manufacturer had inserted into each section of tubing for the stand were sometimes jammed into the tubing crookedly, making it impossible for the lengths to fit together properly. I was able to use pliers to remove and correctly reinsert the threaded pieces, but for anyone counting on a \"no tools needed\" assembly this would be a real problem rather than an annoyance. I would not have been able to remove & reinsert them by hand. Once assembled I was happy with the lamp; it was bright, inexpensive, and sufficient to do the job required, but be warned that the tubing is very thin. It could easily be bent if carried incorrectly or handled roughly.",

                "reviewText": "Item seems sturdy and looks like the picture. However, like most of these types of products, you need to complete the final assembly yourself by attaching the stems of the lamp body together, and this part was very difficult due to an incorrect partial assembly that was done before the item was packed.The lamp body consists of metal tubes which are attached to each other with a threaded connector. After many tries at getting the stems connected, I finally figured out the problem. Two of the threaded connectors in my lamp had been screwed into the stems at an angle. Not sure how they did this because it would seem to require a lot of force. I was able to remove them (luckily without damage) using a pair of pliers and then re-insert them correctly. After I did that, the rest of the assembly was fairly easy.",
