                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Floor Lamp with Shelves for my small apartment, and I couldn't be happier with my choice! This lamp is an absolute gem for anyone dealing with limited space in their living area or bedroom. The built-in shelves are a genius addition, providing both lighting and storage in one sleek package.Assembly was a breeze, taking me just about 15 minutes to put everything together. The quality of the materials is impressive, giving the lamp a sturdy and reliable feel. The design is modern and minimalistic, blending seamlessly with my apartment decor.The lighting itself is fantastic \u2013 not too bright, but enough to create a cozy and inviting ambiance. I love how I can place my favorite books, plants, and small decor items on the shelves, effectively decluttering my space while adding a personal touch.If you're looking for a stylish floor lamp that serves multiple purposes and fits perfectly into small spaces, this is the one to go for. It's functional, aesthetically pleasing, and incredibly practical. I couldn't recommend it more!",

Easiest thing in the world. The hardest thing was maybe getting the shade to clip inside the little clippy things on the inside of the shade. Very very easy to put together. They are not super heavy, but they are not super light. The brightness of the lightbulb is absolutely beautiful. I would give this an overall five star because it is so simple yet. I think they look beautiful once they\u2019re put together. Nice for a tiny living room. I would definitely buy these again. And I would definitely recommend them to anybody who has a small living room, or even a bedroom.",
