                "reviewText": "The desk lamp is very customizable. It has multipoints of articulation allowing left-right, and up-down movements. The different levels of brightness and various light modes are additional features that make this lamp worth buying. Having the options of turning on the center light only, the outer lights only, or all three are rather useful and convenient. Good quality and the clamp stays sturdily in place when moving the lamp to one's preference. The foot print of the clamp is relatively small, which is a plus.One recommendation would be to have two buttons controlling the level of brightness instead of one, one button to increase and the other to decrease the level. Cycling through the brightness levels can be a little annoying, but not enough to enjoy the desk lamp.",

There are controls to adjust brightness and cool/warmth of the lights and the main light and wing lights have separate controls so there are so many combinations of lighting based on need.I have a tall, wide monitor so I was worried about the lamp being tall enough to reach over it but the lamp does and has room to spare. You can make it as short or tall as you need.Also, I have a glass top desk and it attaches perfectly and has been doing great for months. Really love this light. It is excellent.",

This light mounts to the back of my table behind my monitor. It has lots of axis points so it's ultra configurable in terms of height, depth and angle. And, the lighting is also configurable. Temperature (3000-6500k), brightness can all be changed and it has an auto sense feature (can be turned on/off) for ambient light. Now, I have light over my entire workspace. It's a bit \"art-deco\" which is kind of cool (my wife said it looks like a drone). I'd definitely recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "It illuminates my work area perfectly and there are so many ways to adjust the angle and lighting mood. You can flip the side lights towards the ceiling and you get a very nice ambient lighting. Probably a thousand ways to play around. You can flip it sideways, forward, backwards, turn it around, swivel it upwards, downwards. The side lights move independently as well.Some of the features I really like:1) There are 2 different on/off switches, one for the main light (the one in the middle) and one for the side lights. So you can turn on both, or just either one. It's so versatile.2) 5 different color temperature adjustment (3000K all the way to 6500K)3) 5 different Brightness levels adjustments (20% to 100%)4) There is also an auto adjust brightness setting which you can enable or disable5) All controls are conveniently located on the front of the lamp and they are touch-sensitive. You don't have to press down hard. Just a tap of your finger is enough to command.I also have 2x 'BenQ ScreenBar Halo' that I bought for my PC monitors. But each one of those are easily 3x more expensive than this product. You're basically getting this product at a super steal. If you're hesitating on getting em', just do it. Zero regrets on getting em'.",

                "reviewText": "The slim profile, sleek design, and flexible arms of this desk lamp make it very convenient to affix it to my desk. It does not take up much desk space and provides light for a wide area on my desk. Even the lowest brightness setting is sufficient for my work, so brightness is not an issue. This is the best desk lamp I have ever had, and I am glad I purchased it.",

Then the brightness and whiteness can be adjusted. Probably my Best Buy on Amazon this year so far. Once in awhile find a really good item on Amazon.",
