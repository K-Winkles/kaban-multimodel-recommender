It has a push switch with a dimmer that has to be manually switched on everytime you want to turn it on. I've tried plugging it into my smart plugs and turning it on/off remotely, but no success. If the cord was not frustrating it would get a 5/5.I will note that the first lamp I had sent to me had an issue where it kept turning off at random. However, I did an exchange and the replacement works as expected!",

                "reviewText": "It has a really nice warm glow, but you can adjust the brightness and tone. It was a little short for the space we wanted it in, so we added something underneath. I was surprised it was so expensive seeing as it\u2019s plastic. I guess I should\u2019ve read the description closer. The photos made it seem like it was a heavier material. So, it\u2019s beautiful but don\u2019t expect super high quality. I love the aesthetic and the light it provides, I just hope it lasts.",

It can switch between warm, cool, and daylight modes, which I didn't expect but totally appreciate.The whole thing's made of plastic, which is authentic to the original design. The three light settings make it easy to match the mood.Its mushroom donut shape screams mid-century and the orange color really brightens up the place. Check out my video to see the lights in action.In love with this lamp, it's just the right mix of retro style and modern function.",
