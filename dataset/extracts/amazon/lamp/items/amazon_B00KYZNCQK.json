It amazes me how many people write bad reviews for a product when 9 times out of 10 it's because they either misread the description or they didn't bother to read it at all.",

A target run will produce similar quality lamps for about $5 cheaper - so you're paying for the convenience of delivery. That being said, overall they're good quality for the money. Literally looks like they are hand painted. Shades are thick. Color looks nice, and they are small and compact. They work well for tight spaces.",

                "reviewText": "These are cute little lamps (and they are very little, but they are a size such that they make good desk lamps), but they have two major flaws:1. The shade rests too low and the bulb sticks out above the shade. The only solution is to let it sit on top of the ring that supposed to hold it in place, resulting in a shade that's not held in place.2. The only on-off switch is on the cord, and since you really want the cord to dangle below your desk and not sit on top of it, which means there's no way to turn on the light. The product description is rather deceptive, it just says it has a \"rotary switch\" but doesn't specify a rotary CORD switch which is the worst kind of switch in a light.",

Lampshade covers the round bulb too.The other, I placed on my night stand to use after the other half goes to bed without it overpowering the room, so I used a 10w.Note: CANDELABRA is the BASE not the bulb style.

                "reviewText": "Great little lamps! Excellent value for money. We needed some light for reading etc in the bedroom but had very little space to work with on the bedside tables. These are so teeny it\u2019s adorable.. but they give off nice light and they have a sleek, comfortable design that would go with any room. The bulbs are not regular bulbs, they\u2019re the small candelabra ones. I bought some bulbs that work but they stick out the top of the shade a bit because the lamp is so small! I\u2019m sure there are some smaller ones out there though. Overall great product.",
