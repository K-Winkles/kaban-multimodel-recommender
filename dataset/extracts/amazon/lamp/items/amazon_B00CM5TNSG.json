My bad for not checking dimensions but I thought it would at least be an actual lamp . Dumb purchase. Unless you are looking for a Nite light, don\u2019t bother with this. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb",

Plus shipping. I got one at the store for three dollars. The bulb sticks up above the lamp shade. I need a shorter e1240w bulb. So it's a pretty cute lamp. It looks nice. It works. Very small. Specific expensive bulb needed not a regular light bulb. I gave five stars because I would have figured this out if I read further down the description.It's inexpensive until you buy the bulb that costs as much as the lamp. Then I guess it's still inexpensive unless you're poor like me.",

I don\u2019t even know if it actually works because I haven\u2019t acquired a lightbulb yet. It\u2019s just sitting there. :/ I was super excited to use but unfortunately I didn\u2019t notice the light bulb type required on the description. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
