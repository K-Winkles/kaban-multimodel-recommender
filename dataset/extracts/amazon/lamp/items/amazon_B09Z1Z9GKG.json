It\u2019s lightweight but sturdy enough that it doesn\u2019t get knocked over. I love the fact that it has 3 brightness settings and a simple tap turns it on, brightens, or turns it off. I rarely use the usb ports but I did try them and they are functional without detracting from the look of the lamp. It\u2019s not exceptionally bright so if you\u2019re looking for a reading lamp I would recommend something with a brighter bulb but as a nightstand lamp it\u2019s just right. I also like the fact that the slim design leaves plenty of room on my nightstand for other decor, tissues, remotes, whatever you need. The height is also perfectly proportionate for the look I was going for. I honestly don\u2019t have anything negative to say about it. I\u2019ve been using it for about 4 months so I can\u2019t speak to the longevity but so far so good.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, this is a very nice lamp and a good deal for the price. It has a classic, understated look. The touch controls are generally very convenient, and the built-in AC and USB ports are handy.Despite excellent multi-layer protection of the included LED \"Edison\" bulb, it was broken on arrival. I didn't mind since I had already planned to replace it with a white LED bulb. The overall packaging was very good, and the rest of the lamp was in fine shape.The only real complaint I have about the lamp, and this is minor, is that you need to touch the base of the lamp in order to plug things into the USB and AC ports. So while you're flipping the USB cable over because it never goes in the right way the first time, the lamp is sensing your touches and is turning dim-bright-brigher-off-dim-bright-brighter-off over and over.But the rest of the time, the touch controls are convenient. The lamp requires a dimmable bulb, and has 3 brightness levels. Not all of the older dimmable LED bulbs I tried worked well with the lamp. Some flickered badly at the lower brightness levels. But a new bright white dimmable LED bulb works great.Recommended.",

                "reviewText": "My old bedroom table lamp had reached the end of its life just as I bought a new night table. So, I figured I would order a new lamp to go with the new table. It arrived the next day, and I was very pleased to see that instead of shipping the box inside another box, it arrived in the standard Amazon padded envelope with the lamp in its original box inside. Everything was undamaged and safe in a more environmentally responsible shipping package.It took a minute to put the lamp together, and then it was off to its new home. As you can see in the photo, the 'wood grain' finish on the base fits beautifully with my night table. The illumination levels are perfect, from a low setting that is nice and relaxing to a very bright maximum setting that provides enough light for just about any need you might have. The USB charging ports work well to charge my phone and any other USB chargeable device you may have, and if you need to plug anything else to it, there is a 110V outlet on it as well.I like the LED bulb that came with it, as it provides a very clear and clean light, and the shade does a fine job as well. I'm very happy with my purchase and I cannot think of anything I would change about it. Just a nice little lamp for the price.",

                "reviewText": "So far this lamp is great! It was easy to assemble and get set up. It worked immediately without issues. The 3 way dimmable feature works great, nice shades of brightness. So far all the plugs work well. I have a cord for my phone, tablet, and then I have my clock plugged into the outlet. The touch sensor is very sensitive though. It changes light if you touch the base or the rod up the center, so make sure it's where you want it before you plug it in. Beautiful shade, a bit small, but it does the trick for a nightstand, and the light is enough for my bedroom.",
