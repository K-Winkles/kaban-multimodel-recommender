It looks so much more expensive than it is, and it feels extremely sturdy. Unlike the other Amazon lamp we purchased, which was clearly spray-painted gold, the gold accents on this lamp are very subtle and not obviously painted. I also love the look of the pulls, which are functional along with the foot pedal. So many different ways to turn the lamp on, depending on how/where you're seated!I see some other reviewers complain about missing parts and difficult assembly. Luckily, we didn't have any of those issues. All parts were present, and it was securely well-packed, plus assembly wasn't too hard. Average, I would say.",

I tried different outlets too. I tried the bulbs on another lamp and the bulbs works. There is something wrong with the wiring on the lamp that make it so the lamp wont turn on. Hopefully the seller or amazon will figure out a solution that prevents me from returning it, it looks really nice ):UPDATE: 1 star to a 4 starI took apart the foot button by unscrewing four screws. Turns out whoever put the wiring together did not solder one of the wires to the connection block. All I did was twist the wire around a metal plate thru a hole to complete the electrical path. Works perfectly now! The provided bulb is nice and bright with three colors, lamp doesn't look cheap, and looks great in the living room. One star taken off bc of the faulty connection which was fixed easily.",
