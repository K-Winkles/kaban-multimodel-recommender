They look nice and don't take up much space which was key. Also, they were very budget friendly and they weigh a decent amount so they aren't flimsy. Love'm.",

I almost just went to Amazon.com to get the return started because it look like I wasn\u2019t going to like it just from the box. But I went ahead and opened it. I\u2019m so glad I did. I absolutely love everything about this. It was packaged beautifully. It went together beautifully. I bought two of them. I would absolutely recommend and buy them again. They are stunning and they are the perfect size for a place where you don\u2019t need a super large lamp but still you want some substance..",

I read hundreds of reviews and looked at so many different lamps before deciding to take a chance on these. I am so impressed! They arent super small, they are perfect size for nightstands and I would say they would work well for a side table in the living room too. It took me about 5 minutes to put them together. I\u2019ve never seen lampshades that need to be assembled, but it was so easy and they look like any other lamp shade. I love the 3 way brightness so much! And the usb on the side is super convenient. If you\u2019re on the fence about ordering these\u2026 do it! You won\u2019t be disappointed!",

They also are a tad odd to put together - Velcro lampshades around two wire circles so they are not totally straight and even. I\u2019m going to keep looking!",
