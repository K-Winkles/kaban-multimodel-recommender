                "reviewText": "I needed an attractive arc lamp to use over my sewing machine which is tucked in the corner of the dining room. This little beauty is not only very attractive, giving my room a modern feel, but extremely functional. The light is focused on the area I need without over-arching. (Some lamps arched too far for my purpose). The head can be adjusted to face straight down or angle the light. The footswitch is perfect for sewing and the 5' height doesn't crowd me while I sew. It was packaged very well as not to scratch the lamp. Just screw the pieces together and voila! NOTE: When you get to the final pole or top that you are screwing in, simply pull the excess cord gently from the bottom to decrease slack.I look forward to enjoying this for many years. I would definitely recommend it to a friend.",

I did like that the base is pretty heavy and it seems sturdy enough. The globe is much bigger than I realized. I like that. Easy to assemble. Im using a 40w bulb and if the globe is angled the least little bit it blinds you from across the room. It\u2019s a cool lamp but I wouldn\u2019t pay that much for another one.",

My husband ordered it for me for Mother's Day. How excited I was to open it.The color/finish are just perfect and match the base of our coffee table. The lamp goes beautiful with the brick wall and our sofa. I'm yet to install our roman shade, but 'm sure they will go together perfectly.The assembly was super easy, took me maybe 5 minutes. E26 bulb is required and NOT included.The lamp is very sturdy.Lastly the price is great!I highly recommend this lamp as a decorative accent, and to make any reading spot a beautiful one.",
