The remote was very cheap and sometimes didn't respond, but that was a minor inconvenience.Yesterday when I went to turn the light on, it just quickly flashed on and off. I tried using the button on the front of the lamp and it did the same thing. After playing with it for a while, it started flashing on and off and then stayed on...for a while. I can't adjust the brightness or color temp any longer and the lamp sometimes won't turn on at all. I expected a simple LED lamp to last longer than 8 months for $32.UPDATE: The company contacted me and offered me a full refund for the lamp! That's the way to handle consumer complaints. I'm going to buy another and hope it works out. Rating was changed to 4-stars.",

                "reviewText": "First, I am not affiliated with the owners or sellers in any way. But I've got to tell you about this lamp. I just got this lamp to replace my burned out 300W torch lamp. This one does it. It is a winner!But be sure to select the 42W option before ordering. The other 3 boxes below the description are lower wattage.It does everything they say it will do. I love it! It took no more than 15 minutes, if that, to assemble starting at the top as instructed. The remote works great and easily. It actually can stick to the pole by magnet, if you want. If the remote ever fails, you can control the lamp from the buttons on the pole. The pole is strong, not weak like some others. It is LED so no bulbs are needed.I set the main light at the brightest and whitest setting. It remembers that when I turn it back on. The reading light is on an adjustable goose neck. It turns on and off with a separate button on the remote and dims, changes whiteness, etc. separately as well. The reading lamp even has a setting for \"reading\". The big lamp has a setting for \"nighttime\" so you can dim it to a soft orangish glow when watching TV at night. The top large light swivels and tilts all over the place, not just 30 degrees or whatever. A great buy at this price!!",

Even on the remote. I've bought tons of LEDs over the years and many have a remote with buttons for each of the main colors. This just has a single color button that you keep pressing.-- seller resolved my issue with the remote",

                "reviewText": "This is a great low-priced floor lamp, and since it is LED it can potentially last for 20 years before the light goes out. The fact that it comes with a remote that not only powers it on and off but also features adjustment of the brightness level, color temperature, as well as offering a night light feature was as enthralling as it could get with a lamp when I first got it. It beats old-style incandescent or halogen lamp by MILES.And then the problem with the remote started. Whatever I needed it to do began to take TWO presses to accomplish. And then three. And then four. After a while I lost count and I came THIS close to throwing the darn remote against the wall.And then I started testing various OTHER angles of pointing the remote, other than the obvious choice of pointing it AT the lamp. After a while I began to realize pointing it AWAY from the lamp seems to work better. Umm...what the heck?!!!AND THEN I figured it out. You have to hold the remote upside down. As in holding it with all the feature buttons in your palm, and the blank part pointing at the lamp (please refer to my photo). And now every button works as it should with just one press!!!! The brilliant Chinese manufacturing had the remote signal going out from the BOTTOM of the remote, NOT the top! Who knew!Before this I was looking into giving up on the remote altogether and getting one of those WIFI remote control devices and using my phone as a remote. I don't need to do that at all now.Counter-intuitive is intuitive when it comes to some Made in China products. Lesson learned.",
