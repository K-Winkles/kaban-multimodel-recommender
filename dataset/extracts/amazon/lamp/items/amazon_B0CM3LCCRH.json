It is not comparable to the opposition.Return it as soon as I could.",

                "reviewText": "This lamp arrived safely in a box with good padding, and the lamp was easy to assemble. It has a very solid, heavy base, and feels well made. The remote control works fine, though I prefer a more chunky style of remote. But the lamp is best used via an app anyway.The duoCo Strip app that you're meant to use with the lamp didn't work on my Android tablet. I used Magic Lantern instead, which worked great. It has lots of light animation presets. Some of these are dramatic and fast-moving - good for parties. And some I find very relaxing. There are a lot of different effects - I particularly like the glowing fire one - and I was really impressed by the light show this lamp can put on! It was an eye-opener to me.The thing I most like about this lamp is getting it to synch to music. And the coolest feature here is that the lamp doesn't even need to be able to hear the music physically to synch to it if you play the music through the app. For example, you could listen to music through headphones, or play music quietly through a speaker, and the lamp will still synch to it thanks to the app.I really appreciated this feature, because earlier I used the remote control to get the lamp to synch to music, and I had to turn up the volume on my speaker quite a bit and move the speaker closer to the lamp to get the lamp to hear it properly. There's no such issue when playing music via the app.I really love this lamp. It is by far my favourite lamp. I had high hopes, and I'm really impressed and would definitely recommend trying it out.",

                "reviewText": "Enter the realm of radiant brilliance with this Buyya Floor Lamp \u2013 a luminescent marvel that transforms your living space into a symphony of colours and moods.Yes it does look like an Jedi\u2019s weapon of choice when removing the pieces from the securely packaged box and assembling it felt like constructing the ultimate lightsaber, with each section a step closer to harnessing the force of radiant brilliance, giving me the power to transform my space into a Jedi sanctuary, where the aura of colours danced like a lightsaber in the skilled hands of Yoda himself! However, assembling this beacon of light was as smooth as a moonlit waltz and so easy that even an Ewok could comfortably complete the task. It is the perfect solution for the spatially challenged and effortlessly claimed its corner in my living room, standing tall at 5.4ft. The option to remove a section, like a magician's vanishing act, allows it to also adapt to the ever-changing dance of your decor.Facing the lamp towards you, it becomes a personal spotlight, orchestrating a ballet of brightness and ambiance. Alternatively, a shift towards the wall ushered in a cascade of mood lighting, creating an enchanting atmosphere.The included controller, a lightsaber hilt in disguise, grants you dominion over a spectrum of colours and patterns. With each press, you summon the force to dictate brightness, hues, and even music mode. Syncing with the app elevated the experience, letting the lamp groove to the rhythm of my tunes. A microphone in the lamp ensured it danced in harmony with the melodies, a spectacle to behold. Yes, it even danced to the closing beats of the East Enders theme tune from my nearby TV when in music mode!So, here's to the Buyya Floor Lamp \u2013 not just a lighting fixture but a maestro of ambiance and minimalist elegance, ready to transform any space into a vibrant canvas of illumination. Highly recommend!",

It comes in 4 pieces + the control base and the rods can be assembled to the height you wish and so not all of it needs to be used. I was expecting the material to be heavier but it appears to be made of a light plastic and it can easily be knocked over which is a negative. Once it is working it gives off a very impressive light show and a multitude of displays can be selected either by using the remote (preferred) or downloading the suggested app (not required). At a price of \u00a372.99 (at time of review), I would be hesitant to say that this is good value for money but I am no expert on the retail price point of this type of light. It is certainly unusual and a definite talking point when switched on!",

It took me about 5 minutes to assemble and hours of fun playing with all the effects.It's quite tall, coming in at 5ft 4 inches and sits nicely in the corner of my room.There are so many settings, I still haven't figured them all out yet. Everything from strobes to fades, and multiple sequence modes to a static light effect with varied colour options.You can speed up, slow down, adjust the brightness/colours, set it to music or leave it to illuminate the corner of your room with a constant glow. I have yet to download the APP, mainly because the remote control has so many options. There is also a timer function for switching on and off.I also have the ELOUYCKE Smart LED colour-changing corner/floor lamp (which is also awesome), but of the two, I prefer this floor lamp because the base is round as opposed to two angled feet, which are more difficult to position in a room.This lamp is magical. Great for upbeat parties or a more relaxed affair. Mine stands in the corner of my room where I often set it to a warm amber glow. I love this lamp.Well worth the price, in my opinion.Overall, a fab lamp, which is powered by a corded plug, which is a bonus as so many gadgets these days are now USB and there are only so many USB sockets you can use.",

Unfortunately, the ease of disassembly proved to be one its best features, because it's not much good as a light.Firstly, and most importantly, it's not bright enough. It won't illuminate even a small room adequately, so it doesn\u2019t work as a main or even a secondary light source. It does have a range of 16 million colours, and, because of its construction, it is capable of some quite pleasant colour lighting effects. This is easiest to control via the app. There's no Alexa or Google Home integration.Sadly, even as mood lighting, it isn't bright enough. When initially switched on, it's very dim indeed. Once the correct number of pixels is selected in the app, this does improve, but it doesn't get close to providing enough illumination to be useful for anything other than a decoration.For the current price of \u00a372.99, this is very poor value, and I can't recommend it.",
