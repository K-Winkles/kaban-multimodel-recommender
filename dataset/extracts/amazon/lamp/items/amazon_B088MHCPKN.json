            "Contemporary Tree Floor Lamp: The Brightech Saturn standing lamp uses an original design to provide opulence to your bedroom, living room, or office. With a gold/brass finish and circular hanging lights, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find this design anywhere else. The lights mesh with the simple stem and help this lamp for living rooms work with contemporary, mid-century, modern, and Asian decorative styles. Post-modern architectural lines help this tall lamp work wonderfully in any configuration.",
            "Incredible Living Room Decor: Not only will this floor lamp work great with any d\u00e9cor, but it will also draw your guests\u2019 eyes and become a great conversation piece. With this Brightech Saturn floor lamp, you can turn this lamp into the room\u2019s centerpiece while also illuminating the space. Add ambiance and class to your bedroom or living room with this unique standing lamp.",
            "Sleek Design Standing Lamp for Living Room & Bedroom: This Brightech Saturn floor lamp weighs little, coming in at 9 pounds \u2013 it also stands at 5.5\u2019 tall. Because of its height and weight, it\u2019s easy to relocate if necessary so that you can illuminate your room however and whenever you want. Most of the weight comes from the (weighted) base, so this standing lamp will prove challenging to tip over. The included on/off pedal switch will shift the lamp through three brightness settings.",
            "20-Year Lifespan Long-lasting Lamp: This Brightech floor lamp comes with three ring LED lights that attach to the product. Each LED bulb should last 20,000 hours, meaning you should never have to replace the bulb. Because LEDs don\u2019t generate heat, they use less energy \u2013 you can save 85% on your electric bill once you switch from halogen or incandescent. Because LEDs don\u2019t produce heat, you don\u2019t have to worry about burning yourself accidentally.",
            "THE WARRANTY: Unlike other brands, our floor lamps are built to last, and we stand behind that. That's why Brightech USA offers an industry-leading 3-year warranty covering defects, malfunctions, or sudden failures to your standing lamp when purchased through us. Thanks to our friendly USA-based support team, you'll rest easy knowing your floor lamp has the backing you can trust."

There are 3 different dim settings and it gets really bright!The only thing is, and this is my fault for not realizing before ordering, is that the removable rings don\u2019t stay lit when you take them off the stand. I thought I had seen the rings stay lit in the photos/video, but I ordered this 6-7 months after originally seeing it so I should\u2019ve checked again. I\u2019m not sure why I assumed since the rings were removable that meant the stand somehow charged them, at least for a little, thatisn\u2019t the case. Which does make me wonder what the benefit of being able to remove them is, it seems like you could get the same aesthetic with them being secured on.Regardless, I do still love the lamp and plan on keeping it. They offer a 3 year warranty so that\u2019s also a bonus!!",

Additionally you can \u201cturn off\u201d individual rings by moving them off their connection - doesn\u2019t effect the way the lamp looks either. The levels and # of rings lite means you can adjust the brightness to your liking - which is nice. Wasn\u2019t too bad setting up either. The base could be weighted better to make the lamp less wobbly and the switch on the floor is a little awkward to use. Overall not too bad for the price.",

I was sitting about 5 ft away from it and the light was so bright it made me feel strange. I also can't figure out how to make it NOT continually change colors.",

                "reviewText": "I really love this lamp, it makes my rather boring condo bedroom so much more interesting. The light level is amazing - there are 3 levels and my pic shows the highest, good for cleaning etc. The lowest is good when you are settling down and getting ready for bed. The packaging is also sleek if giving as a gift - builds anticipation as to what's inside the box. And the whole thing only took about 5 min to unbox and screw together. My only advice for the maker is I would have had the cord come from under the base plate rather than from the pole (so the cord lays across the base stand and is more noticeable) - but all in all, it's not a big deal. I highly recommend this especially for those looking for a narrow style floor lamp, or those with a minimalist design but want to add some type of structural element of interest or a focal point to their space.",
