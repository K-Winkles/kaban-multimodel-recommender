                "reviewText": "I bought two floor lamps to light up our large Piano room and they did the job perfectly. There are no more shadows, the music and Piano keyboard are lit well, and the color temperature selection feature allowed me to match other lighting in our home. We don\u2019t use the remotes after setup since we power the lamps from outlets controlled by the room light switch. Note each remote controls only it\u2019s respective lamp. Assembly was easy and the lamps are sturdy. We placed the lamps in two corners of the room pointing straight up. We like the sleek, modern design, the bright light output on the highest setting, and that they don\u2019t take up much room, fitting easily behind accent chairs. Though the head of the lamps can pivot, I found when angling the light toward the center of the room it was painful on the eyes to look back into those corners toward the tilted lamp heads\u2014plenty of light was reflected into the room with the lamp head pointe straight up and that eliminated any eye strain from looking into the lamp heads. My wife and I love these floor lamps. They exceeded our expectations in quality, setup, sturdiness, fit/finish, style/design, easy of use, and brightness.",

                "reviewText": "This is the fourth pole lamp I\u2019ve put together in the past 6 weeks. The others were through the Vine program, but I liked the concept and purchased this lamp for its added brightness.Likes:Brighter than similar lamps. Three different light settings.Simple to operate.Comes with its own remote control.Works with Amazon smart plug.Very good directions.Dislike.Not stable at all. Not recommended if placed where it can be bumped.Overall.Simplicity of this lamp.Two of the other lamps I ordered were classified as smart lamps, operated through software installed on your phone. Negative comments on those were by people that just wanted an easy to operate lamp. This lamp is easy to operate and there is no app to download. I added an Amazon smart plug to the other smart lamp for simplicity I lost some features but I just wanted simplicity. This lamp works perfectly with an Amazon smart plug, for those that don\u2019t want to be tied to a remote. You do need the remote to adjust brightness.Stability. All of the lamps that I ordered were in the range of 10 pounds. Although the base seems heavy, the lamps are so tall they are not stable. Great for a no pet, no child household, or if placed in a secure location.Assembly. I recommend placing the lamp on the floor with a pillow under the bulb part. The base props the lamp up and using a pillow on the other end levels it off and makes assembly easier. There was a loose nut in the box with no direction on using the nut. It did go on under the base. Probably not needed. There does appear to be excess cord between the bulb part and the top tube. Slowly pulling the cord at the base removes the slack. The cord, or wiring, runs through every piece. That takes guesswork away. On other smart lamps that I ordered there is a separate tube with no cord running through it. The directions were on those were poor. I placed the separate piece at the bottom, it belonged at the top, and pulled the excess cord. The wiring split. Trashed the lamp. After that learning experience, I ordered another lamp and assembled it easily.Adapter. This is important. The directions state not to use any other adapter. On one of the other lamps I ordered, a less expensive one, the adapter was missing. I used another adapter that I had, and blew the lamp. I trashed it. Another reviewer had the same experience. No adapter in the box, used another adapter, the wire started melting.The remote. Initially it didn\u2019t work. I reread the directions. It said the remove the film on the battery. I hadn\u2019t noticed any film. I removed the film and presto, it worked perfectly.I can recommend this lamp.",
