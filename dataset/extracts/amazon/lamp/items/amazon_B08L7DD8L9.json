I don't understand the reviews that complain about getting the wire caught and breaking while assembling. That has to be because they weren't paying attention to what they were doing! I had zero issues. My 9YO grandson actually put it together!Now, the lamp itself offers many color hues to soften the white light or go full on bright white light. I like that function and the remote is awesome by the way. So far I have one minor complaint that I hope doesn't turn into a major complaint....the goose neck could stand to be stronger? It is very very easy to adjust so I hope it stays strong enough to hold itself in place. So far it works great!This works so much better than the clip on light I had to return because it stopped working after 2 weeks!",

Has a dimmer as well as a light temperature (cool or warm) settings that are easy to adjust. Style is very minimal and can be placed in almost any setting and not be an eyesore. Base and overall build is sturdy and has stood up well. Great little light would definitely recommend.",

Schade, das das Netzteil nur einen US-Stecker hat. Als ich das beim Verk\u00e4ufer angemahnt hatte, erstattete er mir das Geld f\u00fcr einen Adapter. Darum: Alles bestens.",
