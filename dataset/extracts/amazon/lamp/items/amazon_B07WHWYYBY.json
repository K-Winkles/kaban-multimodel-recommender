                "reviewText": "Purpose for this floor lamp was to provide a grow lamp for rubber plant. This works out well for my 3.5 ft plant. While it isn't the height for typical floor lamp, it does provide essential lighting for a grow lamp or a taller reading lamp. Easy to put together- less than 5 minutes. Very sturdy (heavy) round base that has a small footprint. Three sections to assemble the pole and the hooded lamp head. It is flexible and molds well to your desired position. As long as it has any E26 bulbs - LED, grow or (incandescent -under 40 watts) this lamp will work well with this size bulb.While the lamp says it's 58 inches tall, this does NOT mean that its height is 58 inches when the lamp head is bent. At best, you will get about 4 ft, give or take. This switch/cord is shorter than average. The on/off switch is easy to operate, however, it is in plain view and near the top of the lamp. The cord's length is hampered by this placement of the switch and will have a very short reach if trying to plug it in to low outlet that isn't close to the lamp. Best to have the lamp near outlet or a table that has an outlet built in. Even with the small issues, this floor lamp seems to work well as a grow lamp and is recommended.",

One is set up \" tall \", (all 3 sections installed, 50\" bulb to floor) and the other \" medium \" (2 sections installed, 37 \" bulb to floor). Very simple to put together and sturdy. Got these 2 stands because of the color, height adjustment, rated wattage 11w) and NO built-in timer, yes, NO timer. I read timer ones work but you have to reset every day! These I have plugged into a regular \" wall timer \" for 10 hrs. a day, set it and forget it! Also, the Wattage, 11W, some others are less. I don't know if that makes a huge difference but, the Grow Light bulbs I'm using are rated 11W, so just made sense. Do Grow Light bulbs work? I don't know yet, that would be another review. The stands are doing their job, and look great, well, less the dangling wire, but that was the trade off for the color, wattage, less timer, and price that I did like. Good luck with yours!",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice floor style reading lamp for the money. It's nothing fancy but it is good quality, inexpensive, easy to assemble and it does the job. I like the fact that you can choose your own bulb--whatever type and color tone you prefer. My previous reading lamp had a built in LED light source that could not be changed. I thought the color tone was too cool and I wanted a warmer tone bulb. It is rated at 40W but I put in a 60W LED equivalent and it seems fine. The metal shade does not get hot at all. The one way to improve it would be to route the power cord though the body of the stand. Some people might not like the power cord and switch hanging down along the stand.",

It is perfect for my needs. It doesn't take a lot of room either. It does NOT have a remote but that is fine with me. I didn't want one.",
