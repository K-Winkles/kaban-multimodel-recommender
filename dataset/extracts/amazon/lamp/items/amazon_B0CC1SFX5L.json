                "reviewText": "I am weirdly addicted to this floor lamp.How, do you ask?We haven't had proper floor lamps in our house for years. We just haven't needed them, not when we have ceiling fixtures, wall lights, and clip-on lamps to fit every possible place I need them. But, I saw this floor lamp and thought, you know, that looks REALLY handy, so I grabbed one to test out in my office. Wow, am I glad I did!For starters, I don't use this lamp in a fixed place. It's light, sturdy, well-weighted in the base, and easy to move, and so I do all throughout the day. Since it has a floor switch to activate it, I simply tap the floor switch with one sock-covered foot any time I move it. Sometimes it shines over my desk, other times it shines over my cat's bed, the work area next to my desk, the cooking I'm doing in the next room, and so on. I can't really state how strangely versatile it is to have a floor lamp that moves around so well. The shade also pivots easily but also holds any position you put it in well. I've aimed it at just about every angle over the last couple of weeks, from under my desk to the ceiling!I also equipped it with a full-spectrum, daylight reptile lamp bulb so that it provides a nice, even light in natural tones for when I'm taking photographs of whatever I'm working on and doubles as a warming light to shine on my cat for especially cold days. The fact that it's got a warm daylight bulb in it helps to chase the Winter blues away mean I'm even using it when I don't, strictly, need more light, either.The one thing that may give folks a bit of trouble is the assembly. You need to slide the entire pack of styrofoam out of the box, because the parts are tucked into the opposing -sides- and there's no way to get at them otherwise. Also, the lamp comes in tube segments, through which the lamp wire is threaded. This is actually wonderful since it means it breaks down easily for travel, but it can make assembly a little dicey if you don't start with the end with the shade. You may end up twisting the cord quite a bit up there, at the end, if you start assembling the lamp from the base and go up. By leaving the base until last, it means you can simply unwind any twists in the cord in the free end once it is completely put together.For what I'm using it for, I'd rate this floor lamp's usefulness up there with a flashlight or a phone light. I just use it that much.",

I love it so much more than I thought I would! It is quite easy to put together and once done, looks so lovely in the corner of our sun room. It also comes with a bulb, which I really appreciated!The base is incredibly sturdy with a good weight to it! And what I really like is that the head swivels, so you can face the light in the direction you need it! But what I love most is the floor switch, making it so you can simply step on a button to turn it on and off. This is a fantastic feature that I\u2019m become spoiled on! Super functional, versatile, sleek design\u2014 all make this an incredible purchase for your home!",
