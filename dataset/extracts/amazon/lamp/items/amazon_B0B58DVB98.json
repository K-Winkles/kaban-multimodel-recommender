                "reviewText": "I do not usually write reviews, however, I thought I needed to on these lamps because I know there are people out there like me that can\u2019t afford $200+ and fancy lighting stores for a good looking and gook quality lamp. I just bought the buffet in the picture (pardon the off-centered picture) and needed lamps. I poured over all the lamps on Amazon and was skeptical on what the quality would be at $69.00 for two. Upon receiving the package, I was impressed with how well the lamps were packed. The directions were very clear and they were easy to assemble. I am over the moon in love with these lamps and I think they go perfectly with the new buffet cabinet. Now to get a new painting to go with it. I highly recommend trying these lamps. I think you will be pleasantly surprised like I was.",
