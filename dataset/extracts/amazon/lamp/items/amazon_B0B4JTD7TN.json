                "reviewText": "The lamps present well, are good in some areas of the home, for example I have two in my bedroom. These lamps integrate well with Alexa app, and are easy to set up. I've had experiences with smart bulbs and smart plugs on a mass scale, these are easier to set up than most smart bulb technologies. Although most need to go thru a wifi connection, the mobile app in each case used to set up the bulb is a mixed bag. Some for example need wifi 2.4 ghz vs. 5.0, some apps forced a software upgrade which prolonged the process. In one case, my xFinity wireless hub needed to be replaced, and I lost many connections throughout the house, and had to reengage with the Alexa app which was extremely painful. Pay attention to \"Alexa Certified\" or \"Alexa Ready\", etc., when making purchases with smart technology.One issue I have with the lamps, I wanted to find some replacement bulbs to have on hand. The light comes with 1 bulb which is OK, but I could not find any indication or labeling to denote the manufacturer to order just the bulbs. I wanted to make sure I had the same smart tech experience so trying to match the bulb type. There are several options from the controller, such as 1:Many or Many:1 if you want to use a single remote controller to control multiple lamps for example. I called Amazon support and got no where with this question. There was no definitive identification on the packaging of the bulb. Hope this review is helpful.",
