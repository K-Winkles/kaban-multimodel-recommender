                "reviewText": "It's clear that they proportioned all of the cost of this into making the base weighted. The poles are very cheap quality and the threads aren't great. The plastic pieces are also very flimsy and thin. The lamp shade/diffuser is extremely cheap and thin plastic. The instructions are incorrect. They claim yo need to attach 5 poles, but there are not 5 poles included. Instructions also state you may route the cable through the poles, but this is also incorrect because the pole diameter is too small to fit the 2 large things sticking out from the power cable (the switch and the part that plugs into the wall). The final flaw in the instructions is that the top piece that goes directly under the diffuser arrived detached from the top pole. Nothing in instructions says to screw it in and feed the wire through further and out the hole on the side of the top pole. A stupid person would be stuck here!It also appears I received a used unit, with white stuff all over it. This could be why that one part I last described above was detached, as well.It should do for a budget lamp in my living room. I don't care that much about a lamp.. I just want the light mainly. But it's just a bit of a shock to get something so tacky.",

The shade made of plastic was shattered like an egg shell inside the foam protection ...wasn't a fan of the cord being on the outside and not running down inside the neck to the pedstal portion of the lamp like I'm used to. And it's not a Trip lite lamp it's a one flick off and one slide click on a cord option to turn off or on ...base is very sturdy though and has weight to it so unless your trying it won't fall down as easy. Amazon was quick to send a replacement so that was a bonus . So far I'm enjoying it",
