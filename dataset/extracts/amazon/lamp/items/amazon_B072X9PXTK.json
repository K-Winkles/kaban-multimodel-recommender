                "reviewText": "Lightweight, versatile, easy to assemble, affordable table lamp. I saw assembly directions before I purchased it (I always check out everything prior to purchases). I opened the box and immediately assembled it. Then I looked through my light bulb boxes.I used a 7 1/2 Watt appliance bulb, the kind that looks like a smooth, round golf ball. Perfect! I taped the cord to the tabletop so I could just reach over and turn it on and off. No fiddling around to find that switch.I ONLY did that because the lamp is situated in an area with alot of knickknacks, my large iPod speaker, vases, near my InstantPot, and other things. Taping it to the table top (actually small filing cabinet top), makes it so easy to access the switch!I have no idea how long it will last. But it is exactly perfect for my space, with a light-diffusing lamp shade, and ability to use any standard light bulb up to 40 Watts (?) I think.I work in my front bedroom turned office. I often walk across the living room, into the kitchen turning left or hallway to bathroom turning right. I need a nightlight to safely walk around.I don't want to bump into furniture and break something. I have a lot of fragile items everywhere. I don't want to pick up broken glass or ceramics (or lose items I enjoy looking at). Helps prevent giving myself serious black and blue bruises (which I've done far too often in my long life).Years ago, I bought some cute little vintage lamps that use chandelier bulbs. Came with pretty lace and beaded lampshades. But the flimsy lampshade was bright from various angles. Finally looked for other light bulbs and shades. Then realized I should get a new lamp.And this is PERFECT for my needs. Hope it lasts awhile!(I wish the light bulbs I bought locally years ago, sold on Amazon too, would be delivered to my home. I wonder if because I live in California, the exact same bulbs, same manufacturer, won't deliver here but I could buy locally the past. Who knows IF they carry it. And dealing with local hardware stores became a nightmare. Horrible, mean, apathetic clueless employees and minimal stock. So I turn to Amazon, and only Amazon, for many office, household and computer supplies!)",

                "reviewText": "Bought this for my elderly father who lives with us. He survived two strokes and and has been diagnosed with onset dementia. He is able to get around with the aid of a walker. Unfortunately he forgets how to turn his bedroom light on and off. This little lamp works perfect for him in the middle of the night while the rest of us are asleep. I have it positioned on a night stand near his bed and angled towards his door. It picks up when he sits up in bed and also when he is returning to his room. Best of all it\u2019s shuts off automatically. The lamp is smaller than I expected and the supplied bulb was not as bright as I thought it should be. But after two weeks using the supplied bulb it is perfect. It\u2019s neither too bright when his dog triggers the sensor, nor is it too dim when he needing to use the bathroom at night. The bulb is brighter than your standard wall-plug-in night lights and the lamp size is small enough not to take up too much room on the nightstand. It does have the option to manually turn the light on and off and could work as a reading lamp. We haven\u2019t used the ac and USB ports on the side but like the added option. Overall, for our application, the price, size and functionality of this lamp works exactly as we hoped for.",

The only disappointment I had was that it was not compatible with the Canadian plugs and I had to purchase a power adaptor to make it work. The plug it came with is designed for use in Asia only.",
