                "reviewText": "For what you pay (~$34) and for the style, it\u2019s a decent lamp.The metal has a nice heft and the gold paint job is well done and smooth. After you assemble the pole part it\u2019s a bit wobbly but not horribly so, I just wouldn\u2019t hang anything on the neck part.The lampshade is a bit cheap and I\u2019ll probably end up changing it, but for now it works. It\u2019s easy to assemble and it does look like the advertisement. There are just little fabric loose threads bc the material they used probably isnt the best, but I wasnt expecting stellar quality on the lampshade since the total price was $34 - so this was also fine.The floor switch seems sturdy so far and same with the wiring.I only had 2 big issues with this lamp:1) the neck part leading to the pole probably was bent during shipping, but it looked REALLY odd being off center. I was able to bend most of it so it would align with the main pole (the pic i have in this review is how it looks post-bending).2) the bulb gets SO hot only after being on for less than 10 minutes. I turned it on to test it out and turned it off to dissassemble, only to find that the bulb was too hot for me to safely touch. I had to wait a bit before removing it and replacing it with an LED bulb. This is a fire hazard if you\u2019re going to use it for longer than 10 min (which is everybody). if you get this lamp, CHANGE THE BULB ASAP TO SOMETHING THAT WONT HEAT UP SO FAST!Rating this 4 stars because its not a bad lamp at all, they just desperately need to include a bulb that\u2019s safer for customers to use.",

                "reviewText": "Seriously one of the easiest things I've puttogether! The pole is all straight and sturdy, it's packaged very well and will be easy to change out to a different shade later as desired. One of the things I like best about it is that someone has finally figured out that running the cord through the base is a pain in the butt, and instead routed it through a side hole on the bottom pole just near the very bottom so the cord still stays out of the way, but you don't have to fiddle with it. Just put the pole pieces together, flip it upside down and spin the base on and you're off to the races. Love that this was not very expensive yet is stylish and gets the job done for what I need it to do.",

It took me less than five minutes and I didn\u2019t even need to read the instructions. The bulb has different lighting modes, which I love, as I prefer warm light.
