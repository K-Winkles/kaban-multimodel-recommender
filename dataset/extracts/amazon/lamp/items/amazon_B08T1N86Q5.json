                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars The other reviewer and all should know.. a single REMOTE CAN PAIR w/ 2 lamps!",
                "reviewText": "I saw another reviewer giving 4 stars saying that they can't pair the remote to 2 lamps but that's FALSE, YOU CAN PAIR a remote to 2 lamps simultaneously! Just be sure to point the remote and hold the button until you they flash to be paired; sometimes you might pair one only but you really can try angling or adjusting the position of the remote to get both. I just had to write this review b/c I don't want people to miss out on this amazing lamp from their spread of misinformation.So once both are paired, you should know something. I'll tell ya it's happened where I turn on/off only one lamp instead of both which can be inconvenient but it can be fun to pretend being a witch with the remote as a wand trying to turn on/off only one for a softer lighting in the room--or just quickly turn off one using the floor button with 100% success rate!So yeah, it can be a little finicky but IT DOES WORK that you CAN PAIR MORE than one lamp! The angle/direction of the remote matters so if you're not getting it, don't give up just yet and make sure you don't lose it b/c it defeats the main purpose of getting this lamp, aside from its awesome dimming capabilities!On a side note, I dunno about 3+ lamps being paired since I've only done it for 2 but my guess is it would work, just make sure they aren't too close together from the rooms to interfere.. in which case, you should probably try to pair them with their designated lamps for the room.Anyway, I have 2 of them in my room and use it every single day at various settings and I love the 5 modes to change it quickly if needed. I'm sensitive to light temperatures/brightness and this helps set the mood and focus in my bedroom as it's also my work studio. In the mornings and late nights, I find it very easy on the eyes to have it on the lowest brightness in the warmest temperature so they can wake up with ease+don't tire out as quickly. The cool temperatures help me take better pictures without that yellow tint in usual indoor light settings. Even my friend & family members were impressed with the lamp and wanted one for themselves! I've had these for several months now and am not sure about the bulbs but word on the web is it's available somewhere on Amazon so it's bound to show up! Maybe we can try the rgb bulbs too but tbh idk about that yet. There are markings on the bulb itself, so we can just use that as a start to find the replacements and hopefully it works out as other reviewers have mentioned.In general, it was easy to assemble, the remote is a good size (6\"x1.5\") with useful functions for convenience--I added silicone bumpers on the back so it wouldn't clank loudly when placed down despite having an ok magnet (could be a bit stronger) to stick it. As for brightness level, like others have stated, it's not as bright as I would like.. hence having 2 in my room, but together it's a big improvement than regular lamps and I'm generally comfortable with them. Actually, I depend on these lamps b/c my room faces away from the sunlight, this changes the game for me for sure. There is some wobble to the pole but I don't have rowdy pets where it might be a concern. The lamp design is simple and lovely too.Overall, I love love love this lamp and highly recommend it if you are looking for an above-average-functional floor lamp with a timeless design, decent brightness and a convenient, handy remote. Thanks and have a great one!<3",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Looking Floor Lamp...",
                "reviewText": "...for a funeral home! No--really! I just happen to be someone that is at peace with the afterlife. Actually, I like the look of this floor lamp just fine. It is simply and solidly built. It was easy to assemble. The remote comes with batteries and allows for all of the color settings and brightness to be adjusted nicely.This lamp stands in stark contrast to my previous floor lamps (I found an old photo of them)--may they rest in peace. Here's the scoop--my previous floor lamps were old and donated to me by the Northern Veteran's Alliance in my state. I'm a Navy veteran. I liked them very much and purchased nice drum shades to dress them up. I was happy with them. They were made from heavy metal and one of them snapped at the base. There was no way to fix it without welding (not an immediate option); so, I was down one standing lamp. That's when I ordered two of these lamps. Ironically, the other lamp developed an electrical problem that same week; so, I had to put it down too.My neighbor has two pewter colored table lamps and my drum shades fit both of them. They were an improvement over the slim linen shades that they came with; so, I was glad they found a good home.That brings me back to the crux of my funeral home remark. When I described the new upward facing lampshade and increased height of my new lamps I had ordered--she said \"like a funeral home lamp\" in her usual charming matter of fact fashion. I said \"I guess so\" half-heartedly.Well, after assembling the first lamp, I started laughing--a lot. My neighbor's remark was dead on--at least her suggestion affected my assessment. She never even saw a photo of this lamp but she nailed it! So, be advised, this lamp has a coolness of its own. I had to call her and share my laughter. It's truly a great looking lamp with very cool features. Very cool. \ud83d\ude0eI am happy with it and you can rest in peace with the the knowledge that this lamp will be a pleasant addition to your household (or funeral home)!",
