As expected, it only takes night light bulbs, so it isn't the brightest, but if you are looking for a cute colored lamp that is fun yet simplistic, this is undoubtedly the one for you. It is also nice if it needs to be left on because it isn't too bright to the point that it interrupts sleep, but just enough to see around the room when all other lights are turned off. The one thing I was a bit disappointed with was that the lampshade came in crunched because of being mishandled, luckily, the lamp itself was fine, but the lampshade needed some work to be put back into shape. Even then, after being fixed, it still has crinkles in it. But overall, it works for what I need and is cute.",

                "reviewText": "But for real - read the dimensions. It makes me sad to see people knocking stars off of this adorable little lamp because it's \"too small\". The dimensions of it are very clear and yes, it is so much smaller than any lamp you'll find in your local department or box store. But that's exactly what makes this lamp AWESOME.This lamp basically fits in the palm of your hand and it is absolutely precious. No, it won't light up a room but if you're into some moody, atmospheric lighting - look no further. I, personally, love the size. I think it firts perfectly on smaller, open shelves or in a dark little corner that you'd like to have some light every once in a while.I do think it's valued for its quality. It is light and feels relatively cheap in your hand but honestly, it is quite affordable so I don't have any qualms with it.The size alone sells it for me. Do note: you need a specific bulb that you most likely don't have lying around your house so but sure to add that to your cart, too.",

                "reviewText": "PLEASE, anyone looking for a small lamp don't be deceived by the add that calls this a lamp! I needed a lamp for my headboard and chose this one. First they don't tell you UPFRONT that it only takes a 6-watt bulb the exact size and shape of a Christmas Tree lightbulb; YES, I am referring to the ones you string up outside your house at Christmas. But, because these people are so underhanded in the way they're out to get your money they don't tell you ANY of this! And after you screw the bulb in which is tricky in itself because you have to pull up on the part that's going to hold the bulb in place, while your holding the bulb and maneuvering the shade \u2014at the same time...And after you've accomplished this exercise in manual dexterity and infinite patience by now you definitely know the bulb isn't the only thing that just got screwed! Now you have a lamp that's all of 6\"-inches high and it's so small that the Christmas lightbulb is extended a good 2 inches OVER the rim of the shade...One of my Dad's old classic Zippo lighters would have given off more light than this lamp! Excellent gift for someone you intensely dislike...like back in the day you'd give somebody a Chia Pet (and no Amazon, I'm not saying anything bad about the product itself; it was just a gift that said you didn't put any real effort into shopping for the person).",

                "reviewText": "I needed small lamps for next to the beds in our guest room. These lamps are definitely small, (I included a picture for reference) but they provide plenty of light and were the perfect pop of color I needed for the space! And at the price point, I feel they are a great deal!The base isn't heavy, but feels sturdy enough that it wouldn't break right away in a fall or anything.Lamp shades are expensive and this lamp/shade combo is not, so I was not surprised that the shades were thin. While taking the clear plastic wrap off of one of them, I dented it. I immediately popped the dent back out and there is no mark or anything, but I don't think these shades would remain undamaged through any punctures or hard falls. Just be gentle with them and they'll be fine.Some commentors say their lamp uses odd lightbulbs or nightlight bulbs, but the yellow one I received doesn't. It uses a 40 watt candelabra bulb, which is what our ceiling fans use. The bulbs are easy to find and provide plenty of light. I will admit that the socket does look a bit different than a standard socket, but the candelabra bulb fit and worked just fine.I bought 2 of these for our guest room and I am happy with them! I would buy more and would recommend them for any space that you need a small lamp or a pop of color!",
