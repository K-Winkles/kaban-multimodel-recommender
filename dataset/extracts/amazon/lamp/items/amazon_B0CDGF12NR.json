                "reviewText": "Absolutely blown away by this floor lamp!!!. Get this lamp if you want a super bright lamp. Has 3,600 lumens which is 500 to 1,000 lumens more than most of the other same type of lamps like this one. Also it's fully adjustable in the type of light you prefer from bright white to a lower yellow. You can direct the light in so many ways to get the perfect lighting situation you prefer. Lamp is cool to the touch even on its brightest setting. Great lamp for watching TV without a bright bulb reflecting off the TV screen or having a bulb shining off in the distance. Assembles in 5 minutes and comes with a super easy 4 button remote control. Also this lamp is priced super cheap. I'd give it 10 stars if I could!!!",

It is so hard to find a floor lamp that can light up a room and this one is great! I\u2019m going to purchase another one to put in my other bedroom. The settings are also very nice because you can change the tone of the brightness if you wanted to make it more subtle.",

                "reviewText": "I've gotten four different lamps around the same price range ($30-$40 when discounted) and this blew all the others away. It stands up straight, the base is weighted, and there's an included remote. The worst about ordering items like this is potentially returning it if it doesn't work/you don't like it. This one was such a good value for the cost, and was much higher quality than the others that actually cost more. Even the light has little ux features like a smooth light up/turn off. It is also the tallest of all the other lamps I've purchased. Really the best lamp I've purchased.",

I can aim it at the ceiling. use it more focus at a particular area of the room. I can dim the setting at several levels. also change the quality of the light for several levels such as white, yellow maybe blue.This light was very easy to assemble. Basically you\u2019re just screwing the different sections of the stand together. I like that there is a little opening at the bottom of the stand, but above the weighted plate. This is where the electrical cord comes out I find that much easier than when they come out of the very bottom plate. The remote works like a charm.",

For rooms without a ceiling light, this lamp bounces light off of the ceiling and illuminates the whole room. The light can also be easily adjusted to bounce off a wall to provide reflected light in a TV room or other area. Great value for the money. My wife liked mine so much that we bought a second one.",

Ideally, would have liked to see it in brushed/satin nickel, but for $50 it is tough to beat, compared with ceiling lights which at the very minimum, would require some electrical work, plus the holes in the ceiling. The brightness of 3600LM is what sold this for me.",
