                "reviewText": "Light bar works well. Installation was very easy to connect and simple. Instructions were well written and easy to understand. The remote is fairly intuitive and easy to use. Where are a variety of automated sequences that it can produce that are pretty cool. There is a built-in microphone that will automate smooth lighting effects off of any soundtrack. You can even connect the light bar to the smart life app for more customizable and programmable options and automations. The lamp length can be shortened as it consists of 4 removable tube. It is possible to control 2 or more floor lamps simultaneously thru either the remotes or thru the smart life aop. Connecting to the app is a bit tricky. Overall I recommend as it provides that ambience to your room",

The only downside I could find to this lamp was that I wish it were brighter, but because it's more of an \"accent\" / \"mood\" light, I find it to be sufficient... do not purchase with the intent of using as a room light source.I do plan on buying another as I feel it perfectly accents my living room at night and sets a cool tone for those movie nights.",

                "reviewText": "The lights are easy to assemble. Just a basic connection. The design is good. I bought these to use in a dj set when I have small house gigs to just add a little extra light. Unfortunately you can't link 2 or more to work at the same time. Each light can be connected to the app but you have to set each one, one at a time to whatever you prefer. The sound activated section is pre programed so you can't change those setting to your desired settings and colors but in all the other sections of the app you should be able to program your light colors and speed. The app also is a pain. You need to sign up then sign in to have it work fully. Then you have to be on a 2.4 internet connection. Trying to connect on 5g just didnt work. Its just more complicated then it should be for a little light. The base power does have the powered remote switch to chose a presetting by clicking it. Basic buttons. On/off, color mode setting and sound activation on or off. All in all if you just want a light for mood setting then its a good choice. If you want them to do a show type effect with multiple lights then look elsewhere.",
