                "reviewText": "I've purchased purchased FIVE of these Seaside Village touch lamps over the last couple of years for various rooms in my home and find them perfect for my needs. The touch lamp base is a nice weight, so they stay put when my pets or young family members don't knock these lamps over (other slender profile lamps tend to be top-heavy, and wide-base lamps take up too much table surface). And they come with an appropriate dimmable LED light bulb that lasts a long time and is cost-effective too! Only once was a lamp delivered damaged (surprising, since these are really well packaged by the manufacturer), but the wonderful Amazon supplier shipped out a replacement right away. That's great customer service, in my book.The design is a slender lamp that allows for three light levels at a simple touch of the metal base, and I've been able to easily dress up the plain shade to match my decor for each room I've placed them in. These are perfect for bedsides, sunrooms, living rooms and foyers; kids rooms, laundry rooms and dressing tables. Without a doubt, I'm LOVING this versatile lamp and highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "Update:The seller of this lamp reached out to me and offered to send me a different light bulb to try with this lamp. They sent me a 4-pack of replacement bulbs and every single one works perfectly! I tried each one and there is no buzzing or flickering with any of the new bulbs. I am amending my review to 4 1/2 stars. I love the look, style, and size of the lamp, and the customer service is phenomenal. I am only withholding half of a star for the dented lamp shade.~~~~~~~~~~I really wanted to love this lamp. I like the size and the look and the three-way touch system. Like many others, mine arrived with a dented shade, but I just put that part to the back of the lamp so no one would see.After a couple weeks of use I am returning the lamp because it makes a faint, high-pitched buzzing noise on both the first and second light levels, and it flickers ever so slightly (like a very faint strobe light) on the first light level. Unfortunately, I use this lamp in my bedroom so usually want it on the lowest light setting which is the most bothersome. I thought I could get used to it or learn to ignore it, but I haven't yet. I would recommend this lamp if it didn't have those weird noise and light levels. I give the style two stars - would have been three except the packaging dented the shade.",

There is no lighting in our family room aside from the canned lights way up high in the two-story ceiling. At night we were leaving the light over the dinette table on, which is behind us. I needed a lamp that was not very big around, due to how small the accent table is. I wanted it to be tall, but not so tall that it reached the art on the wall. I need it to be a 3-way light. I need something with a soft light that wouldnt irritate our eyes if left on for a long period. This fits the bill on all counts and even came with the bulb Included. Very simple to put together and was packaged in a manner that it could not have broken in transit. I was afraid it may look cheap but it does not. I love it.",

                "reviewText": "Lamps arrived quickly, packed very well, and in perfect condition. Nice size lamps, not dinky by any means, and a style that would integrate easily into all but victorian decor, but then I guess you could hot glue something onto it, and it would work in that setting as well! The base is heavy, these will not tip over as easily as many larger living room lamps with a standard sized shade. They put off no detectable heat from what I can tell, and I use mine for 6-8 hours each night, and some days when it is very cloudy and dark out.. Hello.. I live in Washington \ud83d\ude42The 3 settings are gauged great. Low is soft but in no way \u201cbarely there\u201d, and even on high, which puts out plenty of light.. it is still soft.. never harsh. The touch function is amazingly responsive. You barely need to tap it, and it comes on. It is dim for a milisecond, I assume because it is LED, but it full on immediately. Each brightness level, as well as turning the lamp off responds just as quickly. The length of the cord is more than long enough to go behind each side of a queen bed, and I will guess that it would also work for a king with no problem. The quality of these lamps far surpass the price. I plan on buying more of these for other rooms in the house. Very easily the best lamps I\u2019ve owned.. and I am 63. I did check Wal-Mart and not only do they carry these exact light bulbs, but at a very reasonable price. If you are in need of some great lamps, these are the ones! *****UPDATE*****2 months after raving about these lamps, one shade came completely undone on the back seam, I repaired it with a little hot glue and a whole lot of patience. The 2nd lamp just stopped altogether a month later. New bulb was purchased.. nope.. the lamp just died. Tonight, the lamp with the repaired shade bit it too.. just died. So the THIRD and only remaining functioning lamp, I just brought into my room. It is usually in the den and like the den itself, very rarely used. This lamp works fine.. but the back seam of the shade has come apart\ud83e\udd74. And it does not dim. At all.... So... just sayin'....",
