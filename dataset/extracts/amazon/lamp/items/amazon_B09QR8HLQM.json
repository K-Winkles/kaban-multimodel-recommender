The lamp shade is a little crinkled in my picture but that was from me with moving furniture but the lamp itself was packaged nicely. I wanted to show the light bulb I used in the second image. The light bulb is from walmart.. Great Value, Soft White B10 light bulb, 40 watt equivalent. It works GREAT with this lamp! I honestly love the lamp because yes it is smaller then what I was expecting BUT it works really well in my space and the cord is long enough to go down my bookshelf.",

I took the bulb out, looked inside the socket and the metal connector was completely bent / messed up. Waste of money!",

                "reviewText": "Sorry, but just a heads up, this lamp is eh. You might as well invest in something that is of a better quality.A lot of the reviews said it\u2019s smaller than expected and trust them. I assumed it was because they had bigger night tables but as a university student who owns small and cheap stuff, this was small for my cheap and small night table. The lamp was shaking constantly and it felt like it was going to fall apart anytime. The disk roller to turn it on was really tight and hard to move. For a small product, it definitely had a massive wire, which stresses me out since I want them hidden.Maybe it\u2019ll work for a kid\u2019s room but definitely not for an adult. Ever since I bought it, I\u2019ve just hated it LMAO- and I guess the hatred finally went over the threshold so I\u2019m returning it asap after keeping it for a couple of weeks.Just be wary when buying it! Maybe it\u2019ll work for some people but it definitely didn't work for me :(",
