The shade only swivels forward and back\u2026no side to side, and the top does t swivel from the base. However, it looks great, and does the trick all-in-all. We are happy with it.

Usually electric cords are threaded through the base so that the base/lamp has a finished look. I think this was a manufacturing error because the base has an opening for the cord so that the cord could be thread underneath and the lamp can stand level without being off balance due to the cord. Seems something went wrong after the fact. Look at the image on Amazon and you can see the cord is above the base. Very odd. Not sure I can get passed it. May have to return it.",

As someone who loves warmer lighting, I love that there are three light settings. I've included photos of what the lighting looks in my space. If you want it a bit brighter you can easily change it by the step button, or plugging it in and out if you wish.I can easily hide the switch and cord by the side of my couch, but it's long so depending on where you put it, it could be a bit if an eye sore.There is also a seam on the side of the lamp shade so be wary of that when putting it together and deciding on placement.Easy to move but can become loose if you maneuver it too much.Overall, it looks more expensive than it actually was, and I am very happy with my purchase.",
