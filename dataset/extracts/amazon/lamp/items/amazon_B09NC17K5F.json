Gradient teal blue brings a mysterious visual perception. A shiny metallic-finished metal lamp base down below offers a touch of glamour, while an understated white fabric drum shade up above balances out the look.",
            "Noiseless 3-way touch control design: modern bedside lamps have 3-level brightness options (low/medium/high) for you to meet various demands for different times or occasions. It is greatly handy to operate to turn on/off and adjust to your favorite brightness level by tapping any part of the lamp base, no more worrying switch broken or finding it. It\u2019s quiet enough not to give out the noisy pattering like the traditional switch.",
            "Facilitated USB charging ports: two USB charging ports (5V/2.1A) on the base of each table lamp for bedroom. When the power cord is connected, no matter whether the USB desk lamp is on or not, you can quickly charge for mobile phones, tablets, kindle readers, laptops and other electronic devices. Avoid being unable to charge multiple devices at the same time due to insufficient sockets and the lock of charging sockets or your USB cable being too short to reach you.",
            "Aesthetic decoration: the teal lamp set of 2 consists of high-quality glass material and white fabric drum shade that are perfectly combined with the warm tone of the lamp\u2019s illuminated, creating a comfortable environment to protect your eyes.

Yes, following the installation steps, it only takes a few minutes to assemble this beautiful table lamp by hand. 4. Will the table lamps be very large for a bedside? 27.5 inches overall height makes a medium table lamp. Please check the size of the lamp before purchase to confirm whether it meets your requirements. 5. The table lamps look very tall, is it stable on a flat and smooth table?

I was very surprised. For the lamps- they are beautiful. You have to put the metal light bulb part into the glass lamp part, its easy and not a big deal, the extra cord part fits into the metal light part. The lamp shade comes in three pieces and is a bit finicky. The canvas lamp shade has tiny little clips the rings fit into. You have to take the top ring (make sure the inside raised part is upside down) and clip the canvas shade around it. Then do the same with the bottom ring. Then Velcro the shades together. The rings fell off the clips a few times but eventually i got that velcro together, aligned and perfectly hidden. I love the lamps and the 3 dimmable stages are perfect. They look exactly like the picture. The brightness was just what I was looking for and the pricing was what good.",

Anyway, straight out of the box was really simple to put together. You just have to screw the light into the post and that\u2019s it\u2019s! The lamp shade comes with it as well. So easy to clip onto the wire rim. They even supply the bulbs! Put the lampshade on screw it in place and you\u2019re done! What I love is that it\u2019s touch control. Tap it and it goes on, tap it again it goes off. It\u2019s a three-way, which is really nice so you can control how bright or how dark you like it in the room. The glass is a grayish tint to it, which is really pretty.",

Touch them anywhere on the metal and you can change the light by 3 levels of brightness to turning it off and on. No more fumbling around in the dark trying to find the lamp switch under the shade and knocking it over. Charge your cell phone or other gadgets right from the bottom of the lamp. The shades were so easy to assemble and go wonderfully with the lamp itself. The lamps were very well packaged for shipping, no worries about breakage unless someone deliberately smashed the box, I don't think anything could happen to these lamps.",

                "reviewText": "These surprised me. They look exactly like the picture. I had my concerns seeing the packaging. The shades are packaged unassembled and I wondered how that would work. The only trouble I ran into was fitting the socket on the lamp. It almost had too much cord to stuff in. But we managed it. These also come with bulbs which was really a nice surprise. Definitely worth purchasing.",

So easy to assemble the lamp shades \u2013 I had them unboxed and plugged in within 10 minutes. Arrived in perfect condition and I would highly recommend.",

Looks very nice and like the fact that there\u2019s no switch per se. just tap the lamp and it\u2019s a tri-light. It has two USB ports on each lamp, which would be great if my gadgets still used USBs. Otherwise, I\u2019m very happy with my purchase.",
