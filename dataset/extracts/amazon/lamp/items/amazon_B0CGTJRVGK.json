                "reviewText": "This is a pretty cool little lamp. The neck is so flexible, and green, it really did remind me of Gumby. It has a nice, stable metal base so it will stay put. The on/off switch is on the cord, but it is located at a convenient spot on the cord, not too far down. The cord itself is very short, so unless you're putting it right by a plug, you will likely need an extension cord. A lightbulb is included, and the function is very clever. Each time you turn off the lamp and turn it back on, the dimness of the lightbulb changes. There are 3 different settings, and the last one is the warmest light and the dimmest. So why, oh why, are all the settings too bright for me? I truly believe the world will go mad from all this white light; it is simply not natural.Aside from the lightbulb, and that may be a \"just me\" thing, what really lets this lamp down is the shade. Okay, it's plastic and I knew that going in, but does it really need to look so darn cheap? Truly, it is not a pretty shade, and I would be happy to spend several more bucks for a more attractive plastic one, LOL.Overall, it's a very cute and functional lamp which I will use with the flower facing down.",

Some people might say you get what you paid for, but this is not even worth what it was paid for. It's nice that the stem of the lamp is flexible and I don't mind that the lamp shade is plastic. I mind that there are spots on the lampshade where the plastic has marks in it. The lamp shade is just poorly made.What is vastly worse is that the lamp died almost instantly. I plugged it in, and within approximately 30 minutes the lamp died and was no longer working. It didn't work with a different light bulb. It didn't work plugged in elsewhere. It just didn't work. It was an instant return.",

The replacement had the same on off switch, but with each time I turned the lamp back on it came back with a different hue. First hue is white, second is blue and third is yellow. This are very light. The light itself is really piercing in it's brightness. Not kidding about being able to do surgery with it -- outdoors. I finally put a 25 watt painted yellow party bulb in to get the brightness to a point I could look at the light without being blinded. After looking at it with it's special bulb (the light bulb meant for it that came with the lamp) my eyes have black spots in front of them for a while.The lamp itself is quite beautiful. One must be somewhat mindful when moving the \"stem\" part around, as it has to balance and not tip over when you let go of it.Unsure if I would get it again. It's beautiful but it's blinding, even when the 3 hues are available.",
