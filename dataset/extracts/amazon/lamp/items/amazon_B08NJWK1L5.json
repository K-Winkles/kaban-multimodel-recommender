These seemed to be the perfect purchases..Having contacted the retailer to make sure they. were dimmable bulbs & could be controlled by a dedicated wall-mounted LED dimmer , I bought a pair .The bulbs included were not only NOT dimmable (they flickered horribly) , but they changed color temperatures every time they were switched on. I solved that problem by replacing those 3 color temperature bulbs with dimmable ones (single color). The seller was kind enough to discount the cost to offset my purchase of those LED bulbs.Too gimmicky with the AC outlet & 3 color bulbs, I wouldn't recommend buying them...Photos show low & high levels of these lamps.",
