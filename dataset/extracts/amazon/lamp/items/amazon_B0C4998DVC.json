Love the night light feature for when you want to see the entry way but not to wake anyone in your house. Also love the 30 min and 1 hour timer. Remote control comes in handy when entering your house at night. Easily turn on light to see when coming through the front door. Definitely recommend. We already want to buy a few more for the entire house. Just wish it came in other metal colors like nickel or brush chrome. Only had the flat black, but we got it on sale at $26. So it was a steal! Don\u2019t hesitate. Just buy it. You won\u2019t regret it :)",

There is also a switch on the lamp. The remote is magnetic so you can stick it to the base or stem to keep track of it. This lamp works as a counter light as well as a floor lamp. It has a small base so it doesn't take up much room if you need place it on a kitchen counter. My only concern is how long the LED light will last. We shall see...",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this for a bedside reading light, replacing a very expensive but ancient Kovacs floor lamp. It is plenty bright and being able to adjust the hue (locally or via remote) was fabulous. All for about the price of a LED replacement bulb on the Kovacs.Do follow the instructions and assemble the pole from the bottom up! This prevents cord twists inside the pole and needing to re-tighten the sections during assembly (yes, as a guy I didn't read the instructions first).The only other issue is the symmetrical base makes it hard to place next to a wall. Fortunately I was able to switch to the old Kovacs base as all of the hardware on this lamp uses standard lamp part sizing.",
