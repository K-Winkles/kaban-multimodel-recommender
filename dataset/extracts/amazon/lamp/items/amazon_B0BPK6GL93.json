They are very attractive (and I am fussy!), they are a decent size (not tiny, like some other lamps I ordered and returned) and they have three different types of lighting that you can change merely by pulling the on/off chain. On top of that, in the base of the lamp, there is a USB charging port and and a regular outlet. They are really a fantastic deal, and very nice-looking to boot. They are in my extra bedroom so guests have easy access to charge any electronics they might bring with them.",

                "reviewText": "At first I was terribly disappointed because when I pulled the on/off chain the light cut back off instead of changing brightness or color temperature, the way most 3-way lamps work. Since I purchased these lamps to replace 2 dim table lamps that were making me feel like I was going blind, this was not acceptable. Although it is referred to as a 3-way lamp, most have four positions: 1 low (warm light), 2 medium (natural light), 3 high (daylight), 4 off; so it would take 3 clicks or pulls to get to high or \u201cdaylight from the off position. This pull chain switch works differently, and the lamp cycles or changes brightness ONLY AFTER turning off in between, so it would take 5 clicks or pulls to get to high or \u201cdaylight\u201d: (1 low, 2 off, 3 medium, 4 off, 5 high, 6 off/starting position). I read and re-read the product information and could not find information about this, and I had to read pages and pages of reviews to finally get any clarifications on this point. A prominent review even misstates that the lightbulbs are \u201cdaylight\u201d only bulbs. I feel sorry for the people who are returning really good lamps lamps or throwing away bulbs because of this.Beyond this issue, I would give these lamps 5 stars instead of 4. The lamps are stylish, modern, and sleek in design. The measurements provided in the product listing are true, and the small foot print works great for a lot of us. There is a USB charging port and and a regular AC outlet on the base of the lamp for additional functionality. As a bonus, two 3-way LED light bulbs are included. Once I figured out how to cycle to the \u201cdaylight\u201d setting, 2 lamps provide good ambient lighting for a medium sized bedroom that has no ceiling light.These were packaged extremely well. The lamp bases were protected by foam so there was no scratches, bends, or other damage. The lampshades were protected by plastic wrapping so they were not damaged or soiled.These are not statement lamps or art pieces that can function as a light source. But for less than $30, I consider the lamps not only affordable but an exceptional value. I am very happy with my purchase, and I would highly recommend.",
