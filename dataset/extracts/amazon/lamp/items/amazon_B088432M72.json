                "reviewText": "Just what I was looking for. I wanted a tiny lamp for my kitchen counter that wasn't too bright. This lamp is exactly 10.5\" tall with the shade on and the shade is 5.5\" in diameter. It has a long cord and a roller switch to turn it on and off. It was also packaged very well for shipping and came out of the box in perfect condition. Price could have been a bit better, but I ordered it anyway.About the specific bulb needed for this lamp.....I attached 2 pics of bulbs. One pic shows a regular size light bulb next to the size bulb this lamp takes. The other pic shows the bulbs I used in this lamp. I already had 2 packs of these because my Ikea lamps use them, but let me say, I had to hunt for them and the only place I could find them was Home Depot. I don't think they were crazy expensive. You could use the candelabra bulb they recommend, but I like these round bulbs better because they don't stick up over the shade or get overheated and they give off a nice, warm, ambient light. Also, be sure to read the directions because there is a part on the lamp where the bulb goes in that has to be unscrewed and put back on. If you don't do that, the lightbulb won't go in. No worries...they include great instructions and its easy.If you decide on this lamp.....NO bulb is included with it, so I would strongly suggest purchasing bulbs to go with this, especially if you don't live near an area with plentiful hardware stores. (I checked 2 Wal-Marts and they do not carry the bulbs that I have pictured.)I recommend this lamp (its so stinking cute), but know that a regular light bulb won't work in it!!!",

These seemed like they matched but it does not have a marble or granite bottom It has a hollow ceramic bottom that is painted a marble. These lamps are very small. The description mini cannot be overstated. On top of that because the bottom is of light ceramic they are very easy to tip over and break. I would not put them on a table in a living room or any high traffic area where they were needed. Keep in mind these do not take normal light bulbs. They take low watt candelabra or Christmas light bulbs (not included). I am not sure what I can really use these for. Do yourself a favor, spend more money and find something bigger with a real stone bottom. And Amazon stop describing things as stone if they are really ceramic that has been painted marble. Ps. Only the one of the lambs is level the other two have lampshades that are slightly off-kilter to the base.",

There was only ONE five star review when I purchased this and Amazon puts the rating on when first listed on site. My review was 2 star and Amazon made it into a 5 star. Seller complained about my review and Amazon choose SELLER OVER BUYER. My review was 2 Stars.",
