When I emailed the manufacturer they were able to send me a new shade free of charge. The new shade was shipped through FedEx but the shade arrived in perfect condition. The new shade, however, was completely different from the previous shade. The new one has more of a texture to it compared to the old one and I feel the height changed as well but it\u2019s not that noticeable. Overall, I like this product and I think it looks really nice. I like being able to put whatever inside the cloche. I think they need to come up with a better packaging strategy to prevent further damages.",
