                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Easy to install/setup, looks to be working fine so far.",
                "reviewText": "The camera itself is pretty easy to setup, it\u2019s solar powered so there is not much to do besides mounting the camera and solar panel. Both the camera and solar panel come with their own screws and a drill template to know where to drill the screws. I do recommend using a level when mounting the camera so the image won\u2019t look crooked.The app is also pretty easy to setup and use but I\u2019m not a huge fan of its overall design quality. The app works but it definitely looks like a generic app with broken English, I have seen other cameras use the same app so it definitely wasn\u2019t made specifically for this camera. The app requires an email to create an account and it also requires several permissions needed for it to work.The pairing process is explained step by step in the app and it\u2019s pretty easy to do. The app has several features such as two way audio, pan/tilt, motion detection and a video playback if you install a micro sd for local storage. You have the option to get a cloud account but I would go with an sd for simplicity.My favorite feature in the app is the spotlight/ night vision option. The camera has both a strong LED light and infrared lights, the app lets you choose which one to use at night. Infrared works like regular night vision where the light is not visible but you can still see at night, the image will be in black and white. The LED option turns on a bright light which lets you see in color at night, the LED will light up your yard.The video quality looks pretty good but it\u2019s definitely not as good as a wired version. The camera being wireless makes the image have compression issues. Everything up close looks very good but anything about 20ft back looks very compressed which means that you won\u2019t be able to catch license plates or other images that may require zooming in. The video quality would be comparable to a smart doorbell or similar wireless device.The audio is also pretty good, the only issue it has is that you can\u2019t adjust the speaker volume and it\u2019s set very loud by default. The mic is also pretty good on the camera, it picks up sounds just fine. The mic seems to go into a quiet mode after a while and wakes up after a loud sound. It basically lowers quiet sounds like wind or crickets until a loud sound happens such as a voice or car passing by which raises the volume again.Motion detection is especially nice with this camera, I\u2019m not getting false alarms from it. I\u2019ve been getting notifications only when a person is in front of it so far. I haven\u2019t gotten any notifications of animals or cars passing by which is perfect for me, I did set the sensitivity to very low so I\u2019m sure you would get those notifications on high sensitivity.The battery seems to be quite good because I installed the camera during bad weather and it still going despite the small amount of sun it\u2019s been getting. There is a battery indicator on the app that can be set to show a percentage but I doubt it\u2019s accurate since it hasn\u2019t moved out of 100% since installing, I do like that the battery indicator turns green when the solar panel is charging.The one thing I didn\u2019t like about the camera is that it doesn\u2019t have the option to turn off night vision completely. My yard is pretty well lit so I don\u2019t really need night vision to be on but you can\u2019t turn it off, you either have infrared or spot light during the night. I don\u2019t think this is a camera downside, it\u2019s more of an app downside.Overall the camera does seem to work pretty well, it has a good enough video quality and the app is pretty easy to use despite having a generic looking interface. I\u2019m not really sure if the picture quality is actually 2k because it looks very similar to my 1080 doorbell. Either way a high resolution on a wireless camera doesn\u2019t make much of a difference because they are still supper compressed unlike a wired version.",

                "reviewText": "I got the 2K Solar Security Cameras Wireless Outdoor because we live on a hill and the deck in our backyard blocks the view from the main floor. We aren\u2019t able to see our kids playing outside very well to keep an eye on them. This camera is the perfect solution. I do have a few complaints but would still consider getting another one for the front yard as well.VIDEO QUALITYThe camera has both SD and HD settings. We aren\u2019t recording so don\u2019t have to worry about how much storage HD would use so we keep it on HD at all times. The video feed quality looks really good. The picture is very clear. Even the night vision has a very clear image and works great.MICROPHONE/SPEAKERThe microphone is great, allowing us to hear the kids even if they are on the opposite side of the yard. There is also as a speaker so if you need to talk to them to call them that is easy to do as well. We often use this feature to call kids in for meals or to ask them to stop doing something.SOLAR PANELOne of my favorite features is the solar panel that is included. We have had this set up for months and have never had to plug it in as the solar panel keeps it charged. We could have easily set the camera up on our fence or another area of the yard, that doesn't have a power source, and not have to worry about the camera losing battery with the solar panel attached. The solar panel has a cord and that connects to the camera. So you could put the solar panel in a area that receives sunlight then run the cord to the camera where you want it located.APPI do have some complaints about the app. I think all my complaints for this camera comes down to the app. First off the controls for moving the camera aren't always responsive. Though the function of being able to move the camera from an app is really great! The second thing is I can't switch the camera off while not using it. It is always on. The only way to turn it off is to pull out my ladder and switch it off with a physical switch. This is a pain because the switch isn't easy to reach on the camera body. I really wish I could turn off the stream from the app for slightly more privacy reasons.Pros:- Great Battery Life (even without solar panel attached)- Solar Panel- Motion Detection- Voice- Wifi or 4G options- Great Night Vision- Clear VideoCons:- App control to move camera angle is a little fidgety- No on/off switch from within the app. You have to reach behind the top of the camera.- Notification sound is the default iPhone ringtone. Sounds like you\u2019re getting a call.- Subscription service not clear what you get or how much you pay without starting a trial first",
