                "reviewText": "I previously had a Canon T3i and I absolutely loved that thing. It was amazing the results that camera could do for its time and I will always think it's one of the best budget cameras ever made. However, I've recently gotten more into video and that is one thing the T3i wasn't meeting my needs for. It was missing so many features like autofocus and modern video resolutions and frame rates.Therefore, my search for a new camera began. I seriously debated nearly every camera in this price range from every manufacturer. Sony, Fujifilm, Panasonic, you name it. However, it seemed like they all had one fatal flaw to them. Sony with their weird coloring, Fujifilm with the overheating issues, Panasonic with the awful autofocus. Some were better at photos, some were better at video. However, I needed something that would do great with both, as I wanted this to be something I could shoot professional portraits with but also shoot vlogs. At the end of the day, all signs pointed to this camera, and I'm so glad this is the one I chose.I'm not a super-advanced user, however, I do think I've moved past the beginner stage of photography and videography. I think this camera really fits me perfectly as I'm not incredibly overwhelmed with options and features that I don't know how to use, but it still has a ton of capability that allows me to learn more about photography and videography. I've also just been using the 24-105 kit lens that comes with this bundle on Amazon.The video on this is amazing. HUGE step up from the T3i. The face detecting autofocus works great and nearly all of my shots are perfectly in focus unless it's super dark which it has a little more of a struggle with but obviously any camera would. I was a little hesitant about the fairly disabled 4k capability with this camera due (disabled dual pixel AF, crop factor, 30 min time limit, 24 fps max) especially since other cameras in the price range have a more robust 4k capability. However, I've found that 1080p meets my needs just fine and looks absolutely gorgeous. It's also much more friendly on the file size and processing in video editing.The photo capability has shocked me even more than the video. I knew this would obviously be a great camera for photos, but I didn't realize what a step up from my T3i it would be. I honestly thought my T3i photos would look just about as good as this camera since the T3i does admittedly take amazing photos. However, this blows it out of the water. The autofocus on this is SO much better. With the T3i, fast moving subjects were nearly impossible to get in focus. This does so much better. The full-frame sensor on this camera makes a huge difference too. The low light performance is so much better and the size of these photos is insane. You can zoom in to the photos so much and it's still amazingly clear.As for the body of the camera itself, it feels incredibly well made. Grabbing my T3i now feels like a cheap plastic toy compared to this thing. It feels very solid and durable. The grip on the camera is incredibly easy and comfortable to hold.The only negative thing I've encountered so far is the kit lens that comes with this bundle doesn't have a physical switch between autofocus and manual focus. You have to go into the camera settings to switch between them. I don't find myself doing this very often as the autofocus is amazing but when I do need manual focus it's a little bit of an inconvenience.Overall, it's an amazing camera and I'm very happy that I went with this one.",

I've had it for a few weeks now and it's been great. The image quality is a significant upgrade on my 5d Mark 2, low light performance is great, autofocus is super fast and accurate, and it's very light weight.The R series cameras are amazing and this is no exception especially considering the price. It's a steal at under a thousand for an entry level pro quality body.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars EOS RP From an Old Canon 6D User",
                "reviewText": "I own both the original 6D as well as the RP. Ive only had the RP for a short time, but here are some of my impressions. All in all, it seems to be a very good camera. Other than the resolution, I still prefer the images from my 6D but as I said, its early yet.I think the body is a little cheapy feeling. The ergonomics are good and you really dont need the extra bottom plate unless you have gigantic hands. It has a good grip and as everyone has mentioned, its very light. Of course until you add some big EF lenses. Other than the nice grip it tends to remind me of a Sony in that everything is minimal, controls are flush to the body, all black. I would have prefered a little better leatherette cover, and some more slr like controls. However, im being picky here and this would all affect the size and weight of the camera.The EVF is a top notch feature. For landscapes in particular, there really has been no other way but Live View through the LCD, but that has changed. You can almost forget about the rear LCD except for certain purposes, the EVF is that good. It allows you to control everything and see everything including exposure. You can see in the EVF whether the sky is blown out etc. And thanks to drag and focus, you can easily move the focus point , get the exposure you like and lock it in with exposure lock. It is very much like having a peephole LCD. Big points for this.The autofocus is excellent and you can have a combination of them in place at the same time. The eye detect focus from my limited use is very fast and does a great job. If you want to to change the focus, just touch your LCD while looking through the EVF and you can move it, almost anywhere in the frame.There are a number of other great features such as focus bracketing that ive yet to try, but that one has the potential to be great. So all that being said, lets get to the image quality.Anyone moving from an aps-c to full frame Im sure will be very impressed with the RP. With a good lens you cant beat that combination of razor sharp and creamy soft that full frame offers. The colors of course are very good as expected, and here is a surprize. I was expecting the DR to be a real downer but its not. I convert to dng and edit in other programs other than DPP and i was surprised at how much range there is. Its certainly not class leading, but it is very respectable. If you need more than this, you really took a bad exposure. The low light performance is very good, and you can get very respectable images even beyond 12800 ISO with a little work. Now i have to say this, for whatever reason, i still prefer the images of the original 6D. I cant say exactly why, a combination of the tone, color and what i like to call the creaminess is still better for me on the 6D. But again I am splitting hairs. For the most part, the RP is capable of producing images rivaling the best of Canons full frame cameras. And it has a lot of practical convenience features that make this one hell of a camera for the price.",

I'm a novice photographer, however I am very pleased with the quality of photos I can get with this camera, and I still haven't figured out all the settings yet.For a \"Budget\" full body camera this thing is a beast. Great for novice photographers. Canon's UI is also pretty user friendly. Would recommend.",
