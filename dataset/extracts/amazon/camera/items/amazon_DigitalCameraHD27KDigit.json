                "reviewText": "This camera is actually very well made and is great quality for the price. My 15 year old daughter wanted a small camera that would do the basic things that a camera does just so she can take pictures with it instead of putting so many images on her phones space eating it all up and this phone accomplishes just that. I would recommend getting a sd card just to give more space but those dont cost a whole lot and honestly most devices just need an sd card no matter how much room it has so no big deal. The pictures come out pretty good and the camera comes with everything else you need to start up and use, even has a cloth case to keep it in but I got a 12 hard pink case to go with the pink camera and i feel better doing that so she can take better care of her camera because it's not something that should be thrown around of course. Overall, I think this device is great for the price and is a excellent \"starting out\" camera for an older child to even adult as I would use it myself too if I didnt already have the one I got a couple years ago. It's just as good as one of the less expensive Nikons I would have to say :)",
