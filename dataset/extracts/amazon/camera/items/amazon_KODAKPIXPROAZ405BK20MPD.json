I tried and tried to adjust the settings, nothing helped. I finally gave up the hopes of getting any kind of quality picture out of this camera. The Kodak brand did not live up to the standard it once had.",

I previously bought a camera (Kodak 26X still works fine) like this about 15 years ago and now with a better zoom and technology I decided to buy the newest version. This zoom is so nice. We live were there are birds and wildlife and love being able to get some nice photos without breaking out the big camera changing lenses and then putting it all away when done. Easy to carry around. Light weight. Overall a great camera for the money. Lots of photo options for different scenarios.Cons: Doesn't have the second button for vertical photo. The lens cap isn't secured in place with a click like my old camera. Therefor the lens cap comes off quite easily so be sure to use the string attachment so you don't lose it.",

So I decided to buy her this $185 camera as a gift expecting it to at least match the camera of her iPhone 11, with a better zoom. Boy was I wrong. I\u2019ve attached a picture to the review, just look at it, a half-baked potato would\u2019ve done a better job. iPhone 11 photo beside it for comparison.Perhaps photographers are gonna laugh at me and ask what I expected. But let this be a caution for beginners like me \u2013 save yourself from a headache, don\u2019t buy this camera. Phones probably do a better job at this price point anyways, don\u2019t bother and get a more expensive option straight away or just keep taking iPhone pictures",
