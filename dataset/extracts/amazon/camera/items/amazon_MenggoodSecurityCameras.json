                "reviewText": "UPDATE: Customer service is amazing. They refunded me and apologized for the misleading information and have changed the details to what the cameras are actuallycapable of. I am using them in a different location that does not need the extra capabilities and was able to purchase dofferent cameras for where I was going to use these. For a very basic camera these are actually not bad and I would recommend them based on that and how wonderful customer service was. So if your looking for a basic camera these are a decent option! The camera is OK. It has great picture and sound quality I will give it that but I feel like I was lied to. These cameras do not have all the variations in detection that they say they do. No package, no pet and no vehicle detection ONLY human section and human frame. Its motion sensor does work amazingly but the only options are human or no choice and it detects every motion. Unfortunately I can not return them as I missed the 30 day option because I didn't set them up right away as our front porch area was under construction and there was no where to put them without risk of being destroyed so I left my old cameras up instead. If I had known and looked at them prior to use I absolutely would have returned them because the different detection options were the only reason I purchased them.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased a new pair of security cameras from Menggood and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. The cameras are not only sleek and stylish but also packed with features that have significantly enhanced the security of my home. One of the standout features for me is the motion detection. It\u2019s highly sensitive and accurate, sending instant alerts to my phone whenever there\u2019s movement in the camera\u2019s field of view. This gives me peace of mind, knowing that I\u2019ll be immediately alerted to any potential security issues. In terms of durability, the cameras are robust and weather-resistant, making them perfect for outdoor use. They\u2019ve withstood various weather conditions and have continued to function optimally. Overall, I am thrilled with my new security cameras from Menggood. They deliver high-quality surveillance and ease of use, all at a reasonable price. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to enhance their home security.",
