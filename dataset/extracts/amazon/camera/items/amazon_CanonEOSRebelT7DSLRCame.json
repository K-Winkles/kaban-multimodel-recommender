The autofocus works great, but you do have to be patient as it takes a few seconds and you have to wait for it to tell you it's ready (beeps). The colors are nice and bright, and I have to do very little editing on the pictures. Even purple comes out well with this camera.My only complaint is it's a complicated multi-step process to send photos to your phone. I also can't get any computer to recognize the camera when plugged in with a data cable to transfer photos that way. I have to take the SD card out and put that in my computer to pull the photos off, then put the card back in the camera. I've tried everything suggested to get it to work with a data cable, but no computer in our house will see the camera, so we're stuck with the inconvenience of having to pull the card.Overall, however, it's an excellent camera and very easy to use.",

I have spent a few ours learning about some settings which I highly recommend - aperture and f stop plus ISO so I have been using this camera on manual settings. I recommend keeping the camera settings on Raw but just keep in mind when you do that using the app to transfer photos to your phone will take an extremely long time.The battery is extremely long lasting. I have been able to use the camera for several uses before needing to charge it. I bought the 50mm lens with this and wow. The lens that comes with it is great, but don't neglect all of the other lenses you can buy. This is a much easier camera to use than other DSLRs as my photographer that we use told me. If you are just getting into using one of these, you're in the right place with this model.Some examples of photos I took as reference.",

                "reviewText": "The good- usually priced around $500 always seems that between cannon, Walmart, Amazon, or Best Buy you can usually find a sale I bought mine for 399.00- automatic modes are really good and there\u2019s no fluff in using them but the manual modes are easy to learn just watch a YouTube tutorial and maybe keep a cheat sheet in your pocket or bag til you remember what does what and for which circumstance.- light weight- quality is unmatched in the price rangeCons - the shoulder strap is small and kind of sucks I prefer an aftermarket one or a lanyard style one similar to the ones that came on the Wii remote this way it\u2019s attached but still have tons of mobilityHint:If your not not a big fan of huge camera bags and end up holding your camera a lot just get a small cross body or shoulder bag works great for an extra lens or two and a few batteries maybe a cleaning cloth and whatever else you need",
