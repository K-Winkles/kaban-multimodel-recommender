No these are not amazing pictures but look great on the back of the screen. I see these as cameras they can learn with and get used to having a camera. More importantly, if it breaks or gets lost no one cries and we buy another.I am a professional photographer and image quality wise you are looking at a low tier cell phone grade camera with a lot of resolution.

                "reviewText": "I got this camera to keep handy for taking accident pics at the scene if I am, heaven forbid, ever in a car accident. During my truck driving career it was general practice to keep one of those little disposable cameras you send in to get developed in the truck just for that purpose. Guess you could call it habit by now, 15 years and several trucks later. Thankfully, I've never had the occasion to have to use one. I hope it remains that way, but these days people are driving so much crazier that I now have two dashcams, front and back, and now this camera kept charged and ready to use in the glove box of my car. Video and pics, or \"It didn't happen that way\".....am I right, lol? This camera works great for my use, pics are clear and crisp enough and video looks pretty darn good, better than I expected for a \"kids' camera\". I'm glad to have it on board, let's just hope I don't have to pull it out of the glove box and use it \ud83e\udd1e.",

                "reviewText": "If you want a very reasonably priced camera to take pictures and have a little creative fun, this camera is perfect. It is self contained and easy to use. The camera came with a wrist strap, a micro SD card, a carry bag, a cord for recharging, and instructionsThis is an amazing little camera for a beginner or young child. It has a built in flash; it can zoom; and the base has \u00bc\u201d threaded receiver for tripod shooting. The instruction manual is helpful, but not everything is listed in it. I\u2019ll try to highlight some of the features and menu items I found:* ISO: 100 to 400 plus Auto* Anti shake option* Timer capture: 2, 5, 10 seconds* Face detection* Smile capture* Multi snapshot: 1, 3, 5 shots* Mode Settings: Auto, Night, Portrait, Landscape, Badlight, Sport, Party, Beach, High Sensitivity* Flash on/off, auto* Focus: Full or semi-auto* Movie Size: 3840x2160, 2688x1520, 1920x1080HD, 1280x720HD, 640x480* Exposure: 3 stops up and down* White balance: Auto, Daylight, Cloudy, Fluorescent, and Tungsten* Quality: Super fine, Fine, and Normal* Sharpness: Sharp, Normal, or Soft* Effects: Blue, Sunset, Warm, Cool, Over exposure, IR, Binary, Vivid, Undertone, Dog Eyes, Aibao, Gothic, Japan Style, LOMO, Negative, Normal, B&W, Sepia, Red, and Green* Saturation: High, Normal, and Low* Date Stamp: Off, Date, Date and Time* Multiple Languages available.* Date/Time Set* Resolution: 48M, 36M, 30M, 24M, 20M, 16M, 13M, 12M, 10M, 8M, 6M, 4M, and 2M* Power Save: Off, 1, 3, or 5 minutes* Screen Save: Off, 60, 90, or 120 seconds* Beep: On/Off* LCD Brightness: Levels 1-7* Frequency: 60Hz, 50Hz* Card Formatting* Reset to default settingsPros:* Comes with Micro SD Card* Lots of Effects and Features* Compact size* Has zoom and flash* Can be mounted to a tripod* Takes pictures and records videoCons:* Instruction manual is limited in what the camera can do.* Carrying bag is not going to protect the camera. It is thin fabric with drawstring.* The lens cover appears to be clear plastic and could easily scratch.I played around with this camera and even took some video. However, because the video included family members, I cannot share it here. I will say I was impressed that the camera did such a great job with the video considering that it is a point and shoot camera. Placed on a tripod it recorded movement evenly and I did not notice any \u201cchoppy\u201d points in the video (I shot at 1920x1080HD).I did include pictures I took of the instruction manual. I tried to do as many changes as I could think of and I assembled a couple collages of the pictures for you to see. This was only a fraction of the changes you could do. That said, the camera can give you a lot of creative freedom.Overall, I found the camera to be a lot of fun and I would rate it at 5 stars. It is best for a beginner, a young child, or someone on a fixed budget that wants to have a point and shoot camera.",

                "reviewText": "I will do a video later where I will compare it with various other cameras I have, including a professional HD Camera.So far, the image on this camera is very grainy and low grade. They advertise it as a kid's camera, but I think I would spend a little more to get a better image. Sometimes kids luck out and capture a great picture. How sad would everyone be when they can't make a print because the image quality is so low?I would extend this to Video Blogging. Get a better camera, people will notice when it comes to this one.",

                "reviewText": "This was described as a 1080P 48MP camera for kids, but this camera has a lot of features that would make it good for any beginner. It would also work well for a backup camera. It\u2019s pretty compact plus it's very lightweight. It works best in well lit conditions, but I also took pictures of a Christmas lighting display and those came out well. My grand kids, three and seven, have also used the camera and have taken some fun pictures. I think it\u2019s a good value and recommend this item.",
