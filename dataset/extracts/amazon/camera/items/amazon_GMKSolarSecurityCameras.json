                "reviewText": "I needed to monitor my back patio area and the adjacent parking lot nearby. I did not want to run power and data wiring to this outdoor location. It shipped in a nice box with great packaging and an instruction book that is well written. You need to install the Vicohome app and that is easy to do. The wifi setup for use in the home is typical and went smoothly. Note: it only works on the 2.4 Ghz Frequency. Installation was stupidly simple. I used a cordless drill/driver and a step ladder. I put three screws thru the mounting holes and into the trim on my home and attached the camera. I charged the camera overnight and even though it arrived at 50% power, it took hours to get it charged 100%. The camera attaches to the mount very simply with a threaded stud and a locking ring. This whole process is super DIY friendly.The videos are captured when motion is detected. Each video is 10 s and I think that is adjustable but it is fine with me so I left it alone. The motion sensitivity is adjustable and I have it on medium. I tested it by walking around the perimeter of my yard and it catches all motion inside my yard and beyond to the parking lot behind my home (apartments). The videos are stored in the cloud and available to view or download through the app. I can also store them redundantly on a micro SD card - I chose not to use that.Installed for one week and taking about a dozen videos per day. Battery is at 94%. The battery in this camera is not removable. You either have to take the camera down to recharge it or bring a charging cable to the camera. I plan to rig up an extension cord with a charging cable when I need to charge the battery.This camera has extra features and additional cloud storage for a fee. I don't use any of that. I get 7 days of unlimited cloud storage for free. After a full month, if all goes well, I plan on getting another one for the driveway beside our home. My only other experience with security cameras is the Skybell doorbell camera (also no fee for cloud storage). This VicoHome camera streams faster with the same resolution setting. I am satisfied with it.ProsGreat package and instructionsEasy installationNice AppExcellent video - I can zoom the live feed if I want to check something out real time.I can view live feed and recorded videos from anywhere. Works great!No Cloud Storage FeesConsI wanted to set up my wife's phone so that she can see the videos. Instructions for that are included but I could not get it to work. I have not called support about this but I will sometime. This is a small inconvenience at the moment for us.I removable battery would have been nice.",

                "reviewText": "I was truly not expecting a whole lot from these little cameras. I got them yesterday and thus far they have wowed me. I can't imagine better cameras at this price point. Setup was incredibly easy...the easiest I have run across when trying to set up ANY new electronic device. I did note that they are rated for 2.4 GHz only but I do not have access to 2.4 GHz and the distance from the cameras wouldn't be a huge distance away, so I set up one just to see if it would work with my 5 GHz. EDITED TO ADD: I have been told by someone that my router may have mixed 2.4/5Ghz technology inside even though I do not have access to see that listed separately when I look at available wi-fi connections. I do not own the router; it is simply what is provider by my internet provided. It did and it does...flawlessly. One of the cameras is just outside a window about 15 feet from my wireless router. The other camera is at least 25 feet away on my back patio...with a brick wall and 2 interior walls between the camera and the router. I, of course, cannot promise that others will have the same experience...it may have to do with the fact that my router is placed up near the ceiling and that the fiberoptic service I have is overall stellar. Both cameras perform equally well on my 5G. I tried one camera just facing out my front window and it performed great through double-paned windows with a screen on them. Night vision was not so good because of the glare (which is well noted in the documentation provided, I just wanted to give it a try). So I just raised the screen a bit and used super strength Velcro to attach the camera to my window ledge and night vision was great. Just to note: I do live in a condo complex and there are security lights around all the buildings, so my cameras are not operating in total darkness or extremely low light situations. I am still fine tuning my activity zones, alerts and such. Some folks say there is a lag between detection and notification. There is a several second delay but nothing excessive on mine anyway. But I truly only want/need the cameras to capture/record things so that I can go back and look if anything seems amiss around my place. The battery life seems very good thus far. The front camera gets a lot of activity, some of which in the past 24 hours is because of me messing around with the camera. From a 90% charge, in roughly 24 hours, the front camera is down to 61% and the rear camera is down to 70%. I am fine with charging the batteries every few days because it means I do not have to worry about running a cord to a plug. I believe a person can purchase solar panel power but this is just a monitoring thing for me, so if the batteries run down and the camera misses something, it is not a huge deal to me.",

                "reviewText": "For the price, these are really nice cameras. I live in an apartment complex and have one by my front door, and one off my patio window. They are durable plastic and work well. Charging is easy and so is the ease of use. Please be aware if you want cloud storage (the ability to pull up an older video on demand/on the fly) you need to pay for their service which is extremely affordable at $3/mo.The object detection is a little off. Thus the 3 stars in that category. It often times mistakes smaller stationary objects as animals. Didn't like that. There's also a couple of second delay before the motion sensor kicks on and the recording starts. Another reason for the 3 stars in that category.Overall, the image quality is totally fine. Both night and day. The sound is a bit muffled from a distance but very clear when someone is within about 5-10 feet of the camera.I would buy this product again. However if I wanted or needed faster motion/recording time, I'd suggest trying something else. For the layperson and someone who wants to put pause on porch pirates or anyone snooping around it's a great option.",

Easy install, very simple to setup and connect to the app. Great addition to the other camera I have, sign up for the cloud service because it not much at all, skip a Starbucks for one day and it paid up for the month. Recommend very much and I plan on getting several more this year, especially for my chicken coop to keep tabs on my ladies \ud83d\ude01",
