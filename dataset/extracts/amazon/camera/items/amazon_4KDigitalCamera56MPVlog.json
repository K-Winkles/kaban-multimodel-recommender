I loved that it already came with a 32Gb memory card, but I put in one of 250Gb and the camera has worked well. Overall, a very good purchase and if you are like me looking for something affordable and of good quality, this is definitely the camera",

It has a good heft to it that feels well made. The rotating LCD makes it extra fun for selfies. In the days where everyone has a cell phone why have a P&S camera? This gives you the option of being offline and distraction free when taking pictures. The pictures produced tend to be on the cooler side straight out of the camera, but overall very nice quality. For a camera under $100 this is a steal. Camera comes with 2 batteries, charging cable, and 32GB microSD card. I was easily able to fill the 32GB card in one battery charge.",
