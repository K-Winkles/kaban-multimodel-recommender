It is not at all good. looks like an old time camera quality. Might as well stick with your phone and take pictures that way.2. as you zoom, quality doesnt improve. still look blurry.3. takes a moment to fine tune itself. you have to press on the capture button halfway and let it focus and then press it all the way down or else you are really looking at a picture of nothing but blurriness.5. Flash just makes the picture all white.4. Instructions that came with the camera and packaging was nice. that's about it. Id buy this camera for maybe a toddler to play with but not anyone over teen age. Teens wouldn't even like the quality of this item.im so disappointed that I spent that money.",
