Most cameras require internet connection and the images are fed through their servers. This was NOT what I wanted for my in-house baby monitor. I found Wyze, and purchased it with the peace of mind that my video would remain MY video. I loved how easy it was to set up, and how perfectly it has worked for several years now.So when I wanted to purchase an outdoor camera, it was a no-brainer to get another Wyze Cam. I've had it for about a year, and recently purchased my second.InstallationI use these with the light socket adapter, which screws into your light bulb socket, and adds a USB outlet for your camera. (It does NOT take the place of the light bulb - you can still use a bulb as well.) The USB plug fits snug to maintain weather resistance, and there is a sleeve to protect any connections.ConnectingI have installed two of these, and they both took around 2 - 5 minutes to install. Download the app, power the camera and follow the voice prompts. You'll need to scan a bar code from your phone, and press a button on the back of the camera (which can be a bit hard to reach if you've already mounted the camera). You do need to have a 2.4 GHz WiFi connection where you install the camera.CameraThe night vision is great. I have two 60-watt bulbs for my entire large yard, but with the night vision I can clearly see all corners of the yard in full color. In the dead of night I can see to my mailbox, which is probably 100' from the nearest camera and light bulb. Beyond the mailbox gets pretty dark, but if a car drives by I can still see the car well enough to identify the color, make and model. I would not be able to read a license plate from that distance, though, at night or in the day. The picture quality in my yard is good. It's not movie-quality by any means, but it is good enough that I can get a clear look at people, pets, objects, vehicles and animals.Motion DetectionThe motion detection is good. Within my yard, it easily detects people and my dog moving around. It also detects when my motion-sensing lights at the far end of the yard turn on. And during major winds, it will also detect the movement of a large bush. You can set notifications in the app. The motion sensing notifications can get a bit much if you have people or pets moving about your yard regularly.For my outdoor cameras, I opted for Wyze's subscription to store motion events for a period of time (you can download them from the cloud if you want to keep them longer). With one of the subscription levels you can adjust the motion sensing so it does not trigger for known people and pets. It has worked well, though there was one event where I had hoped it would have recorded some vehicles driving by but they were too far away to trigger the recording. Recorded events are very easy to access within the app.The subscriptions have some security features including the option to call for dispatch. I have not tried these features so I can't speak to those.DurabilityI can't speak to cold or snow, but my first outdoor camera has lasted through a year of incredible heat (120\u00ba), extreme UV exposure, severe sandstorms, massive amounts of super-fine dust, and the occasional thunderstorm without any problem. It is somewhat protected as it is installed under an eave, but it is otherwise exposed. I need to occasionally wipe off spider webs and dust, but it has lasted beautifully. I've had 0 problems with it in a year. After a power outage, it reconnects without a hitch.ConclusionOverall, I highly recommend this camera for its usability, privacy, quality and durability.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Continual recording without a subscription",
                "reviewText": "These are the best cameras around for continual recording without a subscription. Installing a SIM card into the camera allows it to record video and audio to the card 24/7, even if Wi-Fi is unavailable for a while (though Wi-Fi is required for initial setup). Most competing cameras will record continually only if streaming to the cloud, usually requiring a subscription; if they have local storage at all, it will usually only capture intermittent still photos.Wyze Cam V3 is a great value for the price. Video quality is good for basic home security/monitoring, but likely not good enough if you want to capture license plates, etc.My 8Gb SIM card stores about 3 days of audio/video, but the camera can supposedly support a card up to 256Gb, if you need a longer video history. When the card is full, the camera automatically overwrites the oldest footage, so you'll always be able to review the last few days.The free app allows you to view realtime video and to review video recorded on the SIM card. The interface is clunky, but it works. It can flag motion events, to help you find moments of interest in the recording. Alternatively, you can pull out the SIM card and view the video with a standard card reader. If you capture footage you want to save, you can download video clips from the app before the footage is overwritten, or you can swap out the card.I've also had success powering this with an external battery pack, for a portable security option where a power outlet is not accessible. I've run the camera on a 30,800mAh battery pack for 8 hours, at which point the battery pack reported it still had about 85% capacity remaining, so I'm confident it could easily power the camera for at least 24 hours. That was with continual recording to the SIM card, and also remaining connected to a nearby Wi-Fi network. There's some chatter on the Wyze user forum that suggests the V3 might stop working if it remains disconnected from the Internet for several hours, but I haven't tested it long enough to observe that issue.",

                "reviewTitle": "Excellent camera for the price",
                "reviewText": "This is an easy and low cost option to add security cameras to your home. I use both Ring and Skybell cameras as well which cost a few hundred dollars each, but the Wyze camera is very comparable for under $50. My observations are as follows:- Very inexpensive compared to the competition- Good Quality Video (1080p) under most conditions. I have seen a problem if there is a lot of motion throughout the video as it can become pixelated throughout. For example, when an ambulance parked across the street, the siren lights caused my entire video to pixelate even though there was no other motion. I could still see things, but the quality was reduced (not crisp). I also noticed that when it was snowing, my ring camera could clearly show the snow falling, but the Wyze camera could not (it looked as if it wasn't snowing). Neither are big deals as it is rare.- Frame rate is 20 fps (Daytime and colour night vision) and 15 fps (Night vision with IR lights). For the most part, this isn't an issue as it captures what you need to see.- Excellent colour night vision - I can easily see everything (I can even read my license plate in the dark with the street lights on and behind my car).- Can add a MicroSD for continuous 24/7 recording - There is limited free cloud storage, but the MicroSD allows you to record non-stop in addition to motion detection events. This allows you to watch beyond what was recorded in the event without paying a subscription fee.- Wyze indicates the maximum MicroSD supported is 32 GB. This provides 3 days, 4 hours of continuous HD recording which is limited. I installed a SanDisk 128GB High Endurance microSDHC and it worked right out of the box with no special formatting.- Motion detection has the ability to identify areas to detect motion. Unfortunately, I still get way too many notifications even while using the Cam Plus paid service. At night, it detects shadows that fall onto my driveway (e.g. from cars or people) and sudden light changes from headlights.- I use my cameras indoors to look outdoors through a window. This picks up a lot of light reflection from my room (I could see my own reflection) even when the camera is pressed right against the window. There is an optional Window Mount, but I don't like the idea of sticking my camera to my window as I can no longer move it. I used electrical tape on my window to surround my camera by about 1 inch. This eliminated the reflection.- There is no switch to disable the mic on the camera. You can disable it in the app to prevent sound from recording, but in reality it can still pick up sound. For example, when I used my Fire TV Stick to display my camera on my TV, I could hear the sound in the room my camera was installed. To get around this, I put electrical tape over the mic hole which physically prevents the camera from picking up sound.- Works with Alexa so I can display the camera on TV using my Fire TV Stick as an example- App loads fast to view my camerasOverall, I am very happy with my purchase. It's an excellent security camera at a low cost point.",
