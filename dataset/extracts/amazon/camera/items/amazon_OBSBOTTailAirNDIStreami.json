It's not completely without supervision. The tracking of an individual and the framing of the individual can get out of sync. Having said that, other than keeping an eye on the monitor, on your phone to makw sure you subject has not wandered out of the frame, its pretty good. Shot an even tonight shooting stills, but the camera was setup on a light stand, did a credible job of filming the speakers. It did need some supervision to make sure it resynced with the speaker after they came back into the frame.All in all, highly recommended.",

The features are ground breaking with NDI, Bluetooth, and enhanced tracking; as well as the standard features from OBSBOT. The Tail Air has up to 2.5 hrs of battery life so you can take you camera out and record out door and not be limited to your content. The tracking capability is off the charts it can track people, animals, and objects. The quality of it is amazing it can do 4k 30fps or 1080p 60fps. The build quality is great with easy access to plug in. The gestures I feel like is picked up much easier than the tiny 2 and that is refreshing. Seeing a company to go up and beyond the standards, as well as expanding the boundaries of streaming/content creation has me excited and hopeful for the future!Pros:-Bigger Display-Picture Quality-Remote Use-Good Mic-Enhanced AI-4k 30FPS",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Today I'm reviewing the Obsbot Tail air,A quick unboxing and we see that you receive a quick start guide and warranty policy card as the paperwork.Obsbot does provide a nice zippered carrying case with a wrist strap. Inside the case we find a USB charge cable, USB-C to USB-A adapter as well as a dual-USB-C splitter.We'll now do a quick walk around the Obsbot tail air. On the front are some status LEDs that show the battery level. As we turn it over, we find a 3.5mm headphone jack and one of the small internal mic ports. On the backside is the power button and USB-C port. On the next side we find the microSD slot and micro-HDMI port and the second internal mic. ON the bottom we have a dock connector and a standard quarter-twenty threads that can be used to mount this to a tripod.As I turn to the side you can see where the memory card goes. This does not come with one which is a disappointment considering the price of the camera, they should have given a small card so you could get up and running.There is a lot to light about the Obsbot air. It does track well, and the video quality is great. In my opinion the internal microphones are very tinny and I would highly recommend against using them if you have any other option. I personally use the 3.5mm jack with wireless lavaliers.Video/audio footage: I'm recording with a wireless lavalier, what I'm going to do now is unplug the lavalier to get back to the internal, and I think at this point it is recording with the internal microphone. A lavalier is not connected to the Obsbot air.The other major nightmare of this would be the microSD slot. It is impossible to push in without a small screwdriver or other tool.The hand gestures work fairly well. You make right angles with your thumb and pointer to zoom, make an 'OKAY' sign to start and stop recording. The one that did cause me problems is that when you hold your hand like a high-5, which is start or stop Tracking, there were times I would point something out like on wheel of fortune and it stopped tracking me. A bit of an inconvenience if you don't catch it.Overall, this is a nice camera, but there are some shortcomings.I am rating this four out of five stars.Pros- Small and portable- AI tracking and hand controls work well- Great video quality (4k @30 fps)- USB-CCons- UVC mode requires reconfiguring the Tail air- Did not include memory card, so unusable out of the box- On board audio isn't great for the price- Slowish charging at only 12-watts",

                "reviewText": "I've been playing with this slick little camera for several days now, and it's close to perfection. I'll start with the negatives. Learning curve. The app is well designed, but the layout does not match the online manual. Many basic features are buried three levels deep, while others are duplicated. Face tracking is easily confused the closer you are to the camera. For example, about 18 inches away from me provides a surprisingly good wide-angle. But if I stand up quickly from my chair, the gimbal starts to hunt. If I use a hand gesture and the gesture is not recognized, the camera often starts tracking my hand. So you really need the app or software running so you can catch stuff like this.Hand gestures work about 75% of the time. They can't be sloppy, and I have not been able to get a couple to work at all.Almost everything can be set, from going full auto to manual on the settings, tracking speed, three memorized positions and more. Cropping, zooming, tracking target. All can be set. For some reason the camera defaults to animal instead of human when recording me - maybe because I have a full beard? But if I use the app I can change it. It's also worth noting that the camera can't spin a full 360 degrees. There's a hard stop - so it would go 359 degrees, then have to travel back to the start to continue. So plan your shots with that in mind.The video records 4K at an average of 98 mbps, so you have excellent quality when recording. Resolution can be set to 4K 30fps or 1080P at 60fps. This requires a class U3 micro-SD card.The camera has a micro-HDMI port for video output, USB-C for computer or accessories. For example, there's a USB-C to Ethernet adapter. There's also an external mic input.The computer software is easy to use and can work stand-alone or with your video / streaming software. I used the app on my phone forst to connect the camera to our network. Then I ran the PC software. When I tried to connect it told me to turn on my computer's bluetooth. My PC does not have bluetooth. I hit \"Esc\" thinking that was it - I needed bluetooth. Nope - the software found the camera on the network, but there was never an indication that was an option.It also runs hot. I had the camera sitting on a book - the base hit about 108 degrees fahrenheit. So you want it on a surface that does not trap heat, or on a tripod/stand. When cameras run hot the battery life usually suffers.Included is a custom fit carry case, two USB adapters and a USB-C cable. The packing is all cardboard, no tons of plastic waste. I wish it had a lens cap, but I can 3D print one. I'd rate it 90 out of 100, and all my complaints are in the software or APP department, and I had to create an account online.",

                "reviewText": "I must admit I was unsure at first. I hadn't come across Obsbot products in the past and all the sales information on the Tail Air almost seemed to be too good to be true. A full 4k30fps ptz camera that fits in the palm of your hand, has a built in battery, able to record, has NDI and AI tracking.... surely not.But in fact I was wrong! It is true and wow does it do it well.I bought the camera as a trial for work as we do streaming of live events from concerts to sports to corporate events and award ceremonies with the plan to put it in along side our usual cameras and give it a test not believing it could be as good as our more expensive PTZ cameras but surprisingly it not only matches them but beats them on a number of key areas.Yes it doesn't have SDI output and only has micro HDMI out and USB C on the body of the camera so you find yourself having to use adapters but that's a small price to pay for what had to be one of the smallest and most powerful PTZ cameras on the market. Coupled with its small size you have it's inbuilt battery, NDI Hx3 and the ability to connect and control over WiFi which gives you a really powerful camera that is so handy to have in your box of tricks on a job.We've so far used it on conferences' on the panel table giving us perfect shots of guests speaking during q&a, on stage as an audience camera where you could hardly see it in the corner of the stage, as a main lectern camera on an awards night and during sports presentations on pitch connected to an additional battery to give us over 6 hours of battery life to show presenters and guests live on the big screens in the ground where the battery and wireless NDI hx3 comes into its own as everything is fast paced and needs to be cleared from the pitch very quickly and a number of other events where we have struggled to wire or power any other camera or the director hasn't wanted a big and ugly camera in shot.Overall I'm very, very impressed with its size, quality and overall usefulness out on jobs.If you are buying this camera on its own rather than as a bundle there are a few additional items you will have to pay for, which is something you need to bear in mind when looking at the purchase cost. Firstly you will have to pay extra for the NDI HX3 licence - the camera works perfectly fine without NDI but its worth purchasing especially if you use vmix or OBS. Secondly I would strongly advise getting the USB c to network adapter so you can use a wired connection as well as wireless for those jobs you csnt trust the wifi and thirdly for the complete set go for the Obsbot Remote as that makes it so quick and easy to get the camera up and running and in position on a job. You can control it via your phone and computer software like vmix etc... BUT sometimes it's just easier to grab the remote and put the camera where it needs to be - just quick and simple and with the added bonus that 1 remote will control up to 3 cameras!Previously we have had the logitech mevo start 3 pack and a couple of go pro in our box of tricks for those times where you need those additional camera shots or small footprint but I think we are now looking to replace the mevo'a with Tail Airs as the mevo are only 1080p and a fixed shot where as the Tail Air are full ptz with tracking ability if needed - which is so much more useful in the box of tricks.Overall I'm so impressed by this little camera and cant recommend it enough - it really has opened up so many more creative ideas and workflows and we are looking at buying more as a company.",

Es gibt, aber auch gute Gr\u00fcnde wieso ich sie mir trotzdem geholt habe.Man hat hier alles,was man braucht. 4k 30fps und Gestensteuerung.Was die Kamera ausmacht ist aber, das sie drahtlos zum Streamen genutzt werden kann. F\u00fcr jeden Content Creator ist das Gold wert. Man will \u00f6fters mal woanderst Aufnahmen und mit dieser Webcam ist das m\u00f6glich.NDI Streaming ist auch m\u00f6glich.Es kann auch eine Speicherkarte eingelegt werden und somit ohne Probleme jederzeit aufgenommen werden.Die Kamera sieht zwar gro\u00df aus,aber wiegt wenig.Dazu kommt, dass es noch eine sch\u00f6ne Box f\u00fcr den Transport dazu gibt.\u00dcber das OBSBOT Programm l\u00e4\u00dft sich alles einstellen. Hier werden auch dir Firmware Updates durchgef\u00fchrt. Diese kommen Regelm\u00e4\u00dfig.Wer keinen PC hat,kann auch die App f\u00fcrs Handy benutze!",

                "reviewText": "The OBSBOT Tail Air Streaming Camera 4K is a very well made product that is great for anyone who makes video and requires features such as PTZ, 4K and sophisticated AI based tracking.The device is made out of high quality materials and made to be robust and durable. The PTZ features work great and due to the high quality CMOS sensor can record in great detail especially in good lighting situations however is still very good with poor lighting.The NDI feature allows you to connect the device to the network and is especially useful in multiple camera and professional setups.Using the accessory App or gestures allows total control of every aspect of recording remotely without having to interact with the device physically. Using professional level video software brings this camera to a new level compared to using web cams or other streaming video devices with far less resolution and features. The app does have some latency so a second or so may elapse before the command is accomplished.After using this for a few weeks I no longer use my phone for video creation or streaming however a downside is that the content can not be mastered in advanced video formats like HDR, Dolby Vision or HDR10+ which many higher end devices and mobiles can accomplish. Given the typical uses of this device those advanced formats are not a necessity however at the price of the device would have been welcomed.Overall this is a great quality product that has features making it useful in a wide variety of applications especially streaming.",
