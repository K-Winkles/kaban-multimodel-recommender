I do dislike that when you go to take a photo with flash it is literally like a flashlight not like actual camera flash. Overall I like this camera and I would recommend for a good beginner\u2019s camera. I use this camera to learn and practice photography and to capture memories. I have taken it with me to different places and I like using this camera.",

                "reviewText": "I had bought my husband this camera for Christmas feeling like it was a pretty nice starter camera. When it arrived I took it out of the box and after playing around with it for a bit to see if it was the quality of camera I was looking for I was initially satisfied enough with the camera to wrap it up for my husbands gift. But then thinking about how I know my husband had mentioned when saying about wanting a camera like this that he would definitely want to be able to get some added accessories such as different lenses. So then I took a second look at the name of the brand to see what type of accessories you could buy for this camera and as far as I could see there was none of the type of accessories such as different size lenses that you could get for it. So I was honestly thinking about returning this one and upgrading it for one that I knew I would be able to get any added lenses or other accessories we might want for the camera. But I asked my husband what he thought and he said after looking at it himself that he was happy with this one, so now we have decided to keep it. But I will say I am disappointed that I was not able to find any of the add-ons that we would have wanted to get in the future.",

I need clear and high resolution pictures of my cakes and other baked goods for my site and magazine submissions.I tried several cameras, but none gives me the clarity and ease of use as the ISHARE 4K digital camera. It was as easy as Point and shoot.The ISHARE 4K Digital Camera offers a comprehensive package for vlogging. The WiFi connectivity, autofocus, and 16X digital zoom enhance versatility. The 3\" flip screen is practical for vlog framing, and the wide-angle & macro lens provide creative options.The inclusion of a 32GB memory card and 2 batteries means extended shooting sessions and storage.Whether you are an amateur or a pro, you will find this camera suitable for all your photography needs.The only downside, I wish a tripod and external microphone were included.",
