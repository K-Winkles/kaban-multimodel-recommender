                "reviewText": "If my seven your old daughter is anything like yours she is fascinated by taking her own photos and movies. She actually has her own iPad, which we've tried to encourage her to use for this, but she really wanted a physical camera. This camera fits the bill and she loves it. And it does lots of things we wouldn't want her to do with the iPad - like taking it running around the playground, or in the sprinkler. Haven't had the chance to try it in a pool yet but she's excited about that too.* Image quality - I've have inexpensive cameras like this in the past and this is better than previous ones I've had. Yes it's a little challenged in low light, but it really shines when the kids take it running around outdoors anyway. In those kinds of applications the image quality is great. The waterproof case does not impact the image quality at all.* Ease of use - it only has a few buttons so you have to get used to what they do. After the kids figure this out it goes just fine. May require a grownup to get the video/photos off the memory card and onto the big screen, but we have a cheap memory card reader and that process is pretty easy.* Features - has some fun filters and things for the kids. Not my cup of tea but the kids love it.* Durability - we just leave this thing in the waterproof case pretty much all the time. It provides significant shock protection as well so no concerns. Give it to the kids and let them at it.Bottom line - if you're looking for a way to satisfy your kid's desired to take their own photos and videos this camera is a great choice. It's also fun to get a \"kids eye view\" into their play - watching the videos taken from their perspective is enjoyable for grownups too.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this camera as a cheapie under water camera for a snorkeling excursion. It was the cheapest under water camera on Amazon. I didn't even care that it had hearts on it. The picture quality wasn't amazing but for under $20, I would say it was great. It's waterproof, and simple to use. Zoom is good too. Only downside is the screen doesn't have good brightness, so a little hard to see the screen outside in sunlight. And the water lock can be knocked open with your hand if you aren't cautious. Would buy again, if I had to, but my camera is good to go for future underwater use.",

                "reviewText": "This is an update after 2 months. After about 1 month the camera quit working. It appeared to charge, but wouldn't turn on. I contacted customer service and they immediately sent another one to my son. Very impressed with the customer service and the 2nd camera has been great.My son has thoroughly enjoyed this camera. It is rather cold where we live so we have not tested the underwater feature yet. It has lasted well over the past 2 weeks. He has enjoyed attaching it to his bike and also attaching it to his remote control car. We have had to help him very little with it. The one negative thing with it is that the microphone doesn't hardly work at all with the case on it. With a 10 year old boy using it I feel much better with the case on most of the time, but unfortunately we are sacrificing audio for that.Overall, I would recommend this to kids ages 6-12.",

                "reviewText": "We got two for Christmas, one for each child. The cameras are cute, small for children hands, and truly waterproof. I like that the cameras are rechargeable (not on disposable batteries) and that they use card (easy to retrieve the pics if the cameras break). The lanyard did not last past the first 10 minutes - the little piece of plastic where the lanyard holds the camera broke in both cameras, really fast. After one month of use (and abuse), one camera is out of service. The photo shutter stays pushed down and the camera won't turn on. Thankfully we could retrieve the pictures as they were on a card. The quality of the pics is mediocre - especially the colors - but honestly my kids don't do art :). I have 15 pics of toes (the same toes) if you know what I mean - so it does not bother me. Videos are fun. I regret that the cameras are not shock proof, and also that the pictures are so easy to erase. My daughter erased all first 400 pics she took because she did not understand what \"reset\" or \"format\" (I don't remember the exact terminology) meant in the menu. Similarly, in view mode, if you press (I think it's the photo shutter button) it goes to \"delete\". This should not be that easy - at least there should be a warning message. Conversely, the menu can be really complicated for kids. Long story short I will probably try another brand for the replacement - to see how they compare.",
