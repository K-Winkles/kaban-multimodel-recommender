I thought it would last a little longer than it did helping her to learn the basic fundamentals of camera function and transfer of pictures. Wanted to wait for a more expensive camera until she knew a little more about what she's doing with a camera. But, you get what you pay for and less in this case.It broke after only a couple hours of use. It took about 15-20 pictures, she tried to plug the cord into the camera and that part broke. It's like there's nothing in the camera to stop the plug from going back into the camera. And, we can't get the camera open without actually damaging the housing unit. Very cheaply made, a waste of money, and an upset little girl on Christmas day. And, she was gentle with it taking care of her new prized possession.Can't rate the software or anything else since we couldn't even get the camera plugged in to transfer her pictures or try out the software. It's going in the trash and we'll be taking advantage of the after Christmas sales to get a better name brand beginner camera.Don't waste your time or money on this camera......",

The photos out of it are at a max 640x480, which is super low, unfortunately. Putting this aside, it's super fun to shoot with. The super small size, and the fact that it's new-old stock (new as in old stock that hasn't ever been used) from 2005. This also means it only works with Windows XP and older, which is a bit of a struggle, but still super fun to experiment with. At least the one I got fully works, and is pink as shown, and comes in its original packaging from 2005. Really for a brand new digital camera, you can't complain for $5.99!!",
