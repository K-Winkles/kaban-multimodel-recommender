                "reviewText": "Love this so much. My just turned 9 year old LOVES it. Multiples of us have the Instax Mini cameras, and he really enjoys the automatic picture print option. Well, he's 9 and I don't know if I want to spend that much $ on something quite yet I feel may be dropped. This camera is the perfect option for him. It has a carrier option for traveling with it around his neck, and it does have an automatic print feature as well as internal storage (probably won't use the internal). He's very happy with it and so am I! Can't beat the price, AND it's small for younger kids and stylish. My middle now wants one! Came with 3 rolls (one in the camera) and 2 on the side. I also ordered extra rolls, as well as a little storage container for it. The only thing you all need that isnt available yet is a little album to store the pictures! For now we are using a zip lock baggy. I'm so pleased. We got the white color BTW. Get this for you or your kids, they will love it!",

However, the camera software freezes almost constantly and the screen and buttons are unresponsive. Sometimes, I can turn it off and back on and it will work for a few more minutes before it freezes again. But sometimes, even the power button doesn't work and we have to wait for the battery to die since that's the only way to turn it off. Then we charge it again and we're lucky if it works for an hour before freezing again. Terrible product.",
