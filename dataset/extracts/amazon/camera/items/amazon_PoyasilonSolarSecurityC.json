                "reviewText": "My favorite company has apparently stopped making outdoor cameras. I needed one for the new shed in my backyard. So after searching, looking, and researching, I came across this one and decided to try it. It wasn't too expensive so I figured I'd return it if it didn't work. I have had negative experiences with little solar panels charging cameras in the past so I didn't set it up with the panel, only the internal battery, which I assumed with my dogs running around, people in the neighboring apartments walking around, and us in the yard, I'd be happy if the battery lasted a week. But I truly didn't expect it to make it past three days. Silly me! It has been a week now (five days) and the camera is still functioning perfectly. The app is telling me the camera is at 100%. I can't believe that, but it is still going so maybe it is. This one has amazed me. I also have a thirty foot micro usb cable that I was going to run through the shed wall to power it, but it has proved to be true to its name: \"Smart battery camera.\" I installed a 128gb samsung SD card. Works great! Weather has not effected it at all. The night vision is better than expected for the price I paid. The app is simple yet highly functional. It was very easy to mount and the solar panel would have been as well. The seals to keep out the moisture are snug and sturdy, not loose and floppy. This thing is sweet! I will be ordering more.I hugjly recommend this to anybody who needs a wireless camera.",

                "reviewText": "So we bought 2 of these cameras after 40 people in my rural subdivision had their cars broke in to one night. I was looking for affordable solar powered and took a chance on this camera, was the cheapest or the most expensive but on the middle. It was delivered same day... YAY.So I waited a couple of weeks to write my review so I could have actually been using it for a while and know whether it was worth my money. These cameras exceeded all my expectations and I'm very happy with my purchase.The app set-up was a breeze, out the box was able to start seeing love video of my property.From the app it is very easy to move the camera left right up down , zoom . ..I can even change it to point straight down if some one tried to be clever and get right under it I can still see that. I can clearly make out a face and plates in day time further than said in discription and 20 feet at night maybe more if I had more.lighting outside, but with cameras light alone 15 to 20 feet. . It has a alarm and two way talk feature as well all controllable through the app.I saw complaints of delay when it went to record movement etc. I did have this for about a day, adjusted setting in app and now it records movement from start to end. Other issue maybe it's to far from wifi source and you need a wifi extenders to make it work where you are trying to locate it. We did that for the camera over our shop away from the house where signal was weaker. No issues since.It doesn't record if your watching live, you have to. Manually record at that time otherwise it auto records your preference like cars, people,animals. I had to adjust it so I didn't get a notification everytime some one drove down my street or my dog took off across the yard after a squirrel.The only thing I would like to see is with the app. If my husband signs in on his phone and the I also went to sign in on my own phone it kicks him off. We cannot both be signed it on 2 different devices and viewing or looking through library of saved recording from the night while we were sleeping. I would like for both of us to be able to sign in without one of getting booted out. It's not often we both login at same time, but when we do one of us gets the boot.All in all this a great camera, great picture,features, day night in the rain. App is easy to use and make adjustments,manually record or snap a picture, night vision or night color picture is clear. Definitely better pictures than what you see on the news when they are showing surveillance picture of a suspect they are looking for, this camera actually shows a non grainy clear picture and would make identifying a person easy.I would recommend this camera to anyone looking to monitor their home...or it could even work as a game camera if you had a SD memory card for viewing later or hot spot for live to use where it's at. .",

                "reviewText": "Simply a product that meets expectations and goes beyond. It has amazing image quality and is very easy to install. The battery life is astonishing; I have the solar panel to charge the battery, and after a week of use, I haven't even connected the solar panel yet, and a significant portion of the charge is still available. The app is also very simple to use and intuitive, and sharing camera access with your family is also very simple and fast.",

                "reviewText": "Based my experience with the first security camera I had purchased this second purchase was even easier to install and setup. As the VicoHome application had been installed on my iPhone with the first camera, I just needed to select the + (add camera), confirm my home network assign select a name (back door) and presto it connected. And the best part was that I did not have to re-enter the 22 alphanumeric encryption code again (whew!). My house faces East so I set up the panel on the side facing South. The cable being 10 foot in length was nice to have. The cable is slim enough that I was able to insert underneath the vinyl siding (see image). The clarity of the image is excellent. The light feature is very good and does an excellent job of illuminating the patio and the backyard. I really like the voice feature and how it picks up sound. I like how wide of an angle the lens is (see image), how much the camera can be positioned and the response to commands from my iPhone via the app. I have not subscribed for the paid services such as the Cloud, et al. I purchased a SanDisk 32 GB microSDXC UHS-I card. Based on my experience with inserting micro disk in the first camera I opted to insert it while indoors sitting at my desk. Once inserted the formatting was easily handled by the application and took less than 30 seconds. A nice feature of the application is when you Select \u201cSD card video\u2019 you can watch a continuous stream. The videos themselves appear to be frugal and do not eat up the capacity of the micro disk card. The first camera\u2019s micro disk has only used 15.4 GB running from September 1 until November 5. I installed the second camera (Poyasilon) on November 6, 2022 and as of November 19 the SD card management shows 1.4 GB used out of 29.7GB available. The temperatures have dropped below freezing the last two niights and the camera works fine. In parallel, I am able to view the live feed as far as forty miles away from the house from my iPhone, even while driving, with no degradation of the image quality.",
