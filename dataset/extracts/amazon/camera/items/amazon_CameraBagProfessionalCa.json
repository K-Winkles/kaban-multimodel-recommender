                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought the medium bag and I am impressed with the protection, size and cost of this bag! It\u2019s heavily padded and has so many pockets. When you carry alot of gear you need pockets ! Right now I have my old camera in it and my new mirrorless in my everyday bag. This bag holds all my stuff I don\u2019t use everyday, plus my iPad and extra batteries etc. I also have a little extra room left on one side. it\u2019s nicely padded where it goes over my shoulder which is great bc it\u2019s very heavy with all my stuff in it. I bought it to mostly store my older gear and not hiking with it but, if I was to hike, I would have no problems with feeling like this bag could protect my camera. I love the side pocket where you can just unzip and take out your camera with not having to unzip the entire bag. Great feature! It\u2019s a high quality bag and easy to carry. I love that you can move around the padding to fit your own gear. I was happy to pay $35 for this bag! I think it will last me a lifetime. It\u2019s also approved by my Yorkie !",

Once packed, items are very close and tight. Hard to manage. Recommend it only in the size LARGE. Wish they had an XL size. I will keep this small one for short uncomplicated outings but must buy a larger more functional bag for all my stuff. You always need ALL your stuff when out shooting. Too hard to run back to the car or home.",
