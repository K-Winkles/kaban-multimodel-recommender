It prints high quality pictures from your phone, but not top of the line quality. It's a fun retro camera/printer that will capture great family and friend pics for albums or display in your home. Super convenient and stylish, I print great quality pics from my phone all the time, and the camera function is there in a pinch if I need it.Likes: prints great photos from your phone via bluetooth, nice case and cool design, photo print quality is very good, several fun options for filters and borders, photos can be edited to get the print to look like you want it to (saturation, sharpness, contrast, etc.), prints come out finished in less than a minute (but not instantly, the picture goes in and out 4 times)Things To Know: this is best used as a printer in my opinion, picture quality will obviously not be as good as your phone when using the camera feature, the little preview screen on the back does not have high enough resolution for you to really be able to tell the quality of the picture you just took (minor blurriness or poor focus will not be obvious), if you're printing more than 10 or 15 photos then you'll need to probably keep it charging",

                "reviewText": "I rarely write reviews, but upon purchasing and using this product and seeing the onslaught of negative reviews, I had to sit down and type one out.First, I do not understand the negative reviews. Maybe some critical thinking skills aren't being applied when others have bought this product. You see lots of \"My iPhone/Android camera takes better quality pictures!\" in the complaints. Let's dissect this. Most smartphones nowadays retail for nearly $1,000 in total, and a key element in their advertising is not only the quality of the built in cameras but the constant improves from model to model. Of course, a smart phone camera is going to produce better quality pictures. It's one of the reasons we spend our hard earned money on them. If all we needed was a device to call and text, we'd still be using flip phones. Let's put our thinking caps on and remember why the little computers in our pockets can take excellent if not astounding quality pictures - because they're built to!Now, this Kodak camera does state it prints \"superior photo\" quality, but it does not boast \"state of the art\" quality or even \"smart phone\" quality, because it knows its place and that would be a flat out lie. Read the fine print, people! Superior does not automatically equate to breathtaking, especially when you look at the product itself. Once again, this is a basic camera/tool. It is not built to be an equal to a smartphone which is essentially, as I said, a mini-computer; It is not built to be an equal to even the lowest tier of professional photography cameras. It IS however, built to be a simple, basic photo taking device that you can also connect to your phone, iPad or other supported device if you choose to.It does what it says on the box, so I am happy with this purchase. I suspect other customers were expecting something far more complex and souped up, and that is not what this camera is.Now, the only cons I have for it is that printing process is a little slow, but it takes less than a minute. The paper quality is good though, so I'll let this slide. You can't have everything, especially if you're buying something that is quite budget when it comes to bells and whistles. And that's another thing I'd like to mention - this prints on modern day photo paper. Do not expect the thick, flimsy paper that actual polaroid cameras printed on. If that's what you're after, then you'll be better off heading over to eBay or a pawn shop.This is a modern take on an old school favorite. Understand what you're buying, and you will be a satisfied customer.",

                "reviewText": "We\u2019ve had this camera for 11 months. It is a wonderful camera. I removed one star because I\u2019m frustrated by some major issues coming up right at the 1 year mark. I would love for those to be resolved. And if they are, I would be an unreserved fan of this camera.The recent issues:Lately we have been having trouble with it recognizing or being able to function with some of the film cartridges, which is extremely frustrating because we have only used the Kodak brand film, and it isn\u2019t cheap!In the last month, the quality of the photo images has gone down significantly. I\u2019m not sure if this is related to a firmware update that was just installed. A lot of the pictures appear less in focus and more washed out.The great:We bought this camera for my then-eight-year-old before a big vacation last summer. He loved it, and it was a wonderful way for him to record our once-in-a-lifetime vacation with dozens and dozens of pictures.In the many months sense, taking photographs of his favorite people, or special moments has been a great activity.It is easy to use. The way the photos print is very satisfying to watch. The cyan, yellow, magenta process is a great color theory. LessonI love that it can connect my Bluetooth to my phone so that we can print some thing we captured when he didn\u2019t have his camera on hand.The resulting photos are bright and durable. The 3 x 3\u201d square size is fantastic. He has had a lot of fun creating mini photo albums with some 4\u201d x 4\u201d blank sketchbooks from Michael\u2019s and some glue dots.I didn\u2019t see manufacturer contact information in my purchase records. I would love to find out how to have this camera serviced or replaced. My budding photographer is very frustrated to not be able to print his images today. And we hope to continue, nurturing his photographer\u2019s eye for many years to come.",

He loved the gift and he is very picky, but he is young and dropped it once and the door came off and something happened internally I guess.So my honest review is that it is a neat gadget and very nice design but it is fragile--more fragile than my other digital cameras.The picture quality isn't great like your phone BUT it does have a cool retro look when printed on the included paper, it's more of an arty thing. I think this product is really fun which is why I replaced it for my son but his friend dropped it again and we are back at square one!Dear Kodak if you are listening maybe you can find a way to make it a sturdier thing.",

There bad!But as a printer it's ok, it prints well enough from your phone photos.I was looking at a cheaper alternative to the Fujifilm one I have and this is it. It cost \u00a318 ish for 60 photos. So about half the price as it's competition. Canon is that for 40 shots, Fuji that for 20 shots.So it's cheap. Honestly in two mind to return it or not. Can't take photos on it but cheap cartridges to print.Shame the reviews didn't reflect this when I looked.",
