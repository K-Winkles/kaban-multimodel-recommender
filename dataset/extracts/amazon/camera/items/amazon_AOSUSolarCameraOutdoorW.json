What I really like is that unlike some cameras with follow me this camera does a good job of following and if one walks past and takes the camera far away where one normally has it aimed - this camera shortly returns to the position one had it in to start. I like this as I don't care who comes out of my yard but I want to see who would walk past and go into my yard. Returning to my original position means it will catch someone coming from the most likely position.",

I wanted to take a moment to share my recent experience with a fantastic purchase I made on Amazon.com \u2013 a set of cameras that have truly exceeded my expectations.After some thorough research, I stumbled upon a brand that not only provides exceptional image quality but also boasts a hassle-free setup. What's even more remarkable is that these cameras are battery-free, thanks to their innovative solar technology.Setting up these cameras was an absolute breeze \u2013 user-friendly and efficient. The results? Simply stunning! The image and video quality far surpassed my expectations, capturing every detail with clarity and precision. I'm thoroughly impressed with the performance of these cameras.Moreover, I encountered a minor hiccup with one of the cameras that arrived with a defect. However, the customer service from the company was nothing short of exemplary. I reached out to them, and within two days, a replacement camera was at my doorstep \u2013 no questions asked. The swift and hassle-free resolution showcased their commitment to customer satisfaction.In a market flooded with choices, finding a product that not only delivers on its promises but also comes with outstanding customer support is truly a gem. I highly recommend these cameras to anyone in search of a reliable, high-quality surveillance solution.Best regards, James D",

It was going well and then suddenly it stopped charging itself with the solar panel.I reached out to customer service and worked with Julie.Let me pause for a second to give props to Julie who went above and beyond in assisting and offering suggestions on what the issue might be. She determined the product was faulty and sent a new one that arrived a day sooner than she originally said. Now I'm not saying she has super powers with shipping but I wouldn't be surprised if she did. Shout out to Julie.So far everything appears to be working great again, and if you have a problem, please reach out to them first. Again I want to comment on the quality of the camera and how clear the picture is, because my RING camera could never.This makes 2 cameras I have by this company in use, with the other set I have being given to a friend. I'm excited for her to experience the excitement I have with these cameras.**********This is our second camera by this company and I couldn't be more pleased at the quality. Will definitely be buying another one soon.",

(it's kind of creepy but also handy when I walk out in the lot to the truck or shed. it will follow me.My wife can use it to call for me if I'm in the shed or working on the truck.Cons:* easy to mount, just click on the mount. I have lots of wind here on the ocean, so i put a heavy zip tie around the mount just to be sure.you can't change the solar aim, so you have to be lucky with the sun's direction. ( they sell one where the solar is a separate mount.you do need ok WiFi Charging, so far even in the grey wintery light of eastern Newfoundland, it has maintained itself at 99% charge.I am thinking of buying one that has a detached solar for the other side of the house. it has a fixed-position Aosu solar cam that is well into its 2nd year now. I have to say the PTZ is nice .",
