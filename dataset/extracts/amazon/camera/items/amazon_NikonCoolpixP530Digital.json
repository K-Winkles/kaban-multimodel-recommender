                "reviewText": "After a week or so of testing this camera, I'm really impressed! I was looking for a superzoom to use along with my DSLR and have for backup. It has tons of features that are fun to use and the quality of the photos is more than I expected. It can be slow to focus in low light or at high zooms, but that is to be expected. I have not had a problem with focusing at all. I love all the scene and effect modes, and I am still trying all of them out. I am including shots using long zoom, moon and landscape. The moon shot was done in moon mode, using a tripod. You get better results by increasing the timer to 10 seconds and turning off the vibration reduction. The panoramic mode also worked very well. Very nice camera for the price. It may take a little practice for an inexperienced photographer, however.",

                "reviewText": "Upon return from a month long trip to the Black Hills, we discovered we no longer had our Panasonic camera, bag, chargers, etc. Needing a replacement the no longer available Panasonic, the Nikon P530 refurbished seemed to have all the attributes we wanted and more than we had with the Panasonic yet still within our price range. Got it in just a few days, just at the peak of the color in the hardwoods here in northern Wisconsin. Camera feels great, controls are all where they ought to be, and I don't have to depend on that worthless (most of the time) lcd image on the back! This camera can do all my Nikon SLR could do and has the wide-angle and telephoto built in and not taking up all that space and weight (and bother) of the film camera. Wish I could just use my great exterior Nikon flash in this one, and I still have to find some accessories (filters, hood, etc.) but the built in flash seems ok. and the photos seem fine with the standard non-filtered lens. Haven't taken that many photos, and can't speak for the battery, though certainly seems fine after a couple of weeks and 35 photos. And the refurbished aspect? Sure looked new to me. Not a scratch, smudge or indication of any prior use. In comparison with other cameras, this is a great bargain. Further review if my first impressions are in any way incorrect.",

                "reviewText": "Package arrived very quickly. VERY glad this is a USA model sold by an authorized Nikon dealer, so I can actually get it serviced should something happen to it.Love the camera. It takes amazing pictures, and will take better ones once I am a more knowledgeable photographer. I like the simplicity of the presentation compared to the entry level Nikon DSLRs (3200, 3300, although they are similar). Very light weight and easy to use. LOVE the pet setting - that is a great feature that automatically focuses and takes a picture of a pet's face without me doing anything! The price is also just right for me. The DSLR-like body has a great feel to it and it makes it easy to hold and shoot steadily, unlike wee little point and shoots. Even though it is bigger than the run of the mill P&S or other Coolpix models, it is hardly cumbersome. Also glad it has a viewfinder.Some things I dislike (perhaps I'm nitpicking):1) Nikon does not provide a full manual. You must look it up online and print it yourself. At least they are conserving paper, but I would like to read how to use all the functions, because I am not that familiar with these types of cameras.2) Nikon got rid of geotagging photos in this model. Why?3) No sensor to switch between LCD screen and viewfinder.4) Shutter speed scrolling wheel is a bit annoying, since it takes longer to adjust than the multiwheel for aperture and navigating the camera.5) As another reviewer mentioned, you cannot attach a lens protector to take photos with (perhaps there are some made now that I am not aware of). I would like to have this protection while I am using the camera, not just the lens cap when it is stored away. Overall this is a great starter camera for the photography enthusiast or novice who wants to learn a bit more and take sweet pictures. I hope to improve my skills a lot with this camera and get some great photos on my travels and backpacking trips. Would definitely recommend to anyone.",

                "reviewText": "I've used Nikon DSLR cameras for many years. I bought the CoolPix P530 for a trip overseas where I needed a small camera to save space. First, the good things about this camera: the 1,000mm (equivalent) lens does an excellent job, and the anti-shake feature makes it even better. This camera takes excellent photos if the sun is at your back.Now for the bad news: This camera will blow the highlights like you can't imagine! I took it to the Middle East where I had an abundance of sunshine, but anytime the sun was not directly behind me the photos were very washed out (basically worthless). I often used my iPhone 6 so I could immediately post photos to social media without having to upload photos from a SD card\u2014when you compare the iPhone photos with the ones from this camera you realize that the iPhone does a much better job in nearly every situation. In fact, were it not for the telephoto lens of this CoolPix, I would have rather taken ALL of my photos with the iPhone!A couple other problems: This camera does not offer the ability to take photos in Camera RAW\u2014something it really needs because it is terrible with the highlights. Also, this camera is painfully slow\u2014it is slow to start up, slow to shot and slow to save. Finally, the battery is only good for about 200 photos before recharging (and that is with the monitor turned off).Bottom line, unless you really need the telephoto lens, just use your iPhone (plus the iPhone is much better at taking panoramic photos).",
