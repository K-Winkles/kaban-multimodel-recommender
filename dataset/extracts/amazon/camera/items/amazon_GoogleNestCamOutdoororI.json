I am very happy with them. The motion detection is great, the picture quality is great, and with the very active neighborhood that we live in, the battery life is great. As they're magnetically attached, very easy to remove and charge which doesn't take too much time. The Google Home app has improved and overall I'm very happy with the camera's. Of the many name brands that I've tried (wired and wireless) these are the best I've had.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve only had this camera for a month or so but wanted to share a few things you should know.1. I have 6 or the generation 1 outdoor nest cameras. I like them but this is a good and comparable replacement. It was easy to install and it works well.2. Lake many of the many, if not all, new Google Nest products, this camera does not work with the Nest App. You now have to use the Google Home app. I suspect eventually, everyone will put pushed to use that app, even people using the older Nest products.3. This camera does not come with a cable that allows you to plug in. Instead, you can use the internal battery, which realistically, needs to be recharged every month or so (not the advertised 3 months). You can also buy a third party solar panel which keeps that battery charged at around 70%. As another option, you can purchase a cable which allows you to plug it in. Why would you want to do that, you ask. Because running on the battery and/or solar does not do continuous recording like the gen 1 camera did. The only way to get continuous recording would be to plug it in.",

                "reviewText": "Please DO NOT waste you time with this. You will NEVER get support when the cameras malfunction.I purchased these July 12, 2023. When I got the two cameras and the doorbell, I charged them and waited until July 15th for my son to come help me mount them outside in my yard. Everything seemed fine. Then it was time to charge them. I could get a step stool and reach the cameras, so I brought them inside. This was August 13th, around 4 weeks of use. I have them under the roof edge, protected from the sun and rain. For days now, I have attempted everything to charge them. NOTHING WORKS. Here are my main issues.First, I want to address my experience with Amazon customer service. The first person stated they would issue a return and I could exchange them. Great, just what I wanted. I felt maybe I got a bad batch of cameras. As she was starting the process, I was stating that I looked online for help. I seen a few forums talking about the issue but nothing resolved. She then asked if I would be willing to talk to Amazon technical support. Sure, I can do that. Maybe they have some experience with this issue.Talked with the next person, he runs through everything about what I have tried. I explain it says \"offline\" and even on the charger, it is not registering on my Google Home app. When charging my doorbell, it shows it as charging and how long until charged. Not with the cameras. I even removed them from my home network, did a factory reset, and still they show up as 5 days of charge left and will not register as charging. At this point he says, \"Let me call this number for Google and see if I can get someone on the phone to help us and I can see if I can get you transferred to them\". Great! Maybe they have an easy fix so I don't have to send them back. A few minutes later, he gives an update about still being on hold. He does this a few times. Great communication, I loved him checking in with me. Another 10 minutes goes by and he gets back on the phone. Now I already told him, I used Google to find a customer support or technical support number for Nest products and Google couldn't tell me.You are not going to believe what GOOGLE told him. So he tells me that Google would not allow him to transfer or connect me on the call. I had to personally reach out to connect with them. This technical person said they would not be able to give any guidance to him, or offer suggestions to try and fix this. WOW! SO he said they gave him a way for me to connect with them. ( support dot google dot com backslash googlenest ) YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. I explained to the Amazon Support person that I have spent 2 days on this same website and can't connect to anyone. You answer the questions and it takes you to a forum and question section where someone with the same question has been getting feedback about. Let me tell you this: If you have issues like me where your camera is offline and won't connect to your home network, or you can't get it to charge, you won't find anything here. There is literally no connection to this in the options given. Now you can search on Google and it will take you to a few places, but it won't directly offer you this as an issue to attempt to resolve.So the Amazon Support person said he would transfer me back so I can get an exchange or a refund if I wanted it. Now another person takes my call. She reviews what is going on and asks me \"What do you want now?\" Um, an exchange on the product. She says she can't process an exchange or refund. My window of opportunity ended yesterday. No it did not. I watched it on my end and it says August 16th and that is today. I tried for days to try and get this figured out. I need to send this back so you can send me out a replacement. Again she says no. So I walked through the process on my computer while speaking to her. I then said, should I hit the submit button and take it to my local Kohl's? I want to exchange, not refund. She puts me on hold and comes back to say she can't exchange, just refund. She was able to find another way around it in the system. REALLY?So in the end, I am getting a refund that will take 2-3 weeks. Normally it goes onto my Amazon balance and I can order it again right away. Not this time! It goes to my credit card, who is not going to process that refund right away and sit on it for awhile. I asked why it can't be issued as a credit on my Amazon account and was not given a \"solid\" reason. So I hung up and called back. Next person explains \"Due to the high value item, it goes back to the original payment method. We do not offer exchanges with high value items\". Interesting.Now I know where I will not be buying any \"high value\" electronics from. I will find them locally and purchase in the store. This is highly unacceptable customer service. Now I will not be able to have cameras on my home until Thanksgiving break because I won't have anyone around me to install them. Everyone is leaving for school soon. I can't climb a ladder and use a drill or power tool to install them.As for the products, my doorbell is great. The cameras were nothing fancy and didn't really help me see people clearly. I wanted to have more than 30 seconds recording when someone was in my yard. It defaults back to 30 seconds and the settings show you can have it for 2 or 3 minutes. I also did that subscription thing, which I think is probably a waste of money. After a few weeks being installed, I constantly had my cameras show offline, then they would show online after a few hours. Not worth the price of these things. My neighbor has different cameras, so maybe I will just look for something else when I finally get a refund.Amazon, you really need to consider your return policy. I can send back $7 glasses and get an exchange right away. Even weeks later. But have an issue with a \"high value\" item and you are treated like someone who cried wolf.Google, you really need to have a way for someone to contact you.",

                "reviewText": "These cameras are very nice and the build quality seems superior, however, I\u2019ve used several other brands for home monitoring and they all had similar performance at much better prices. I chose these ultimately because I wanted to pair them with my other Nest indoor cameras and have a seem-less integration within google home.The battery power seems slightly less efficient than other brands I\u2019ve used (blink) and the accessory cables are outrageously priced if you do want to go the wired route. I bought the 2 camera pack and they only provided 1 charging cable. You think they could have included one cable per camera so you can charge them both at the same time. Not a deal breaker, but seems like a odd place for google to skimp. Just another way to charge customers more for accessories. If the single camera box comes with a cable, the 2 camera box should come with two.",

Then a man walked into our backyard and rummaged through my husband\u2019s car! Our neighborhood is very safe so I was shocked! I took the footage to the police but because we only had one camera we were not able to identify him. The next day I bought these. We had someone come and install the mounts because our house is brick. But the tech side of the set up was a breeze! Took me 5 seconds to pair with my google home. I changed my settings to only turn the camera on when there is a person present to save battery life. They work great. I get notifications every time the mailman comes or my family arrives home. The night vision is also great! Haven\u2019t had to charge them for about a month now either!",
