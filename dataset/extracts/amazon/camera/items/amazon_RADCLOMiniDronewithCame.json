As an avid drone enthusiast, I was seeking a compact yet powerful drone, and this one fits the bill perfectly.Firstly, the 1080P HD camera delivers stunningly clear and sharp footage. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the images and videos captured, even in varying lighting conditions. The ability to capture aerial shots with such clarity adds a whole new dimension to my photography and videography projects.The drone's compact size is a huge advantage. It's incredibly portable, making it easy to take on outdoor adventures without any hassle. The controls are intuitive, and after a quick setup, I was able to fly it smoothly, capturing breathtaking views effortlessly.One of the standout features is its stability in flight. Despite its small size, this drone remains remarkably stable, which is crucial for capturing steady footage. Additionally, the battery life is impressive, allowing for extended flying sessions before needing a recharge.I appreciate the durability of this drone as well. It has endured a few bumps and minor crashes (due to my learning curve!) without any significant damage, which speaks volumes about its build quality.The RADCLO Mini Drone with Camera is an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced flyers looking for a reliable, compact drone that doesn't compromise on performance. I highly recommend it to anyone in search of an affordable yet high-quality aerial photography solution!",

I believe that covers most of my questions.He is rough on equipment but this drone still has blades, workable camera, and few scuffs on its shell. It has been use a lot and I\u2019m sure has crashed more than its share knowing the temperament of the operator and his skill level. He says the control is easy, no broken parts for a couple of months of flying and he would recommend this product for his age group and for a great price.Recommended by the buyer",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this drone in order to view the roof of my house and chimney without having to climb up. The drone was very easy to learn and I would recommend it for beginners.I did notice that the drone would drift one direction, even when flying inside. When flying outside, even in the mildest breeze, the drone would get caught in the wind and make it impossible to fight out of it. When attempting to go above the house, the wind blew it into the side multiple times. It seems to be a little light and does not turn 'far' enough to fight out of winds.The app is trivial, but easy to use. The pictures and videos worked fine saving them to my phone.Would recommend for inside flying. Would not recommend for high flying outside (unless there is little to no wind).",

It came in nice box and had good instructions how to set it up, configure it and then maneuver it with remote control. Took some time adjusting to controls and hitting wall and ceiling few times, we were able to successfully fly it. Battery capacity is good. It lasts 30-40 mins with 2 batteries. Had lot of fun with kids and it's value for money.",

I am as novice as they come when using a drone and I had absolutely no issues learning how to set the machine up and use it. I felt like a kid again!I would without a doubt highly recommend this drone for beginners to experienced operators. The drone is light, well made and seems to be on the higher end of quality.If you are looking for a reliable, reasonably priced drone then this is the right choice for you",
