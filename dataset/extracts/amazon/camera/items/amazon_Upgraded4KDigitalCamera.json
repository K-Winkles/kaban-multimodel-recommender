                "reviewText": "Ok, here is my review on the camera after using it. On first sight everything you need to get rolling does come with the box, which makes set up a breeze to get playing with your new camera. I do that I must mention this was after having the two unit replaced due to faulty batteries and software, however, the consumer service was probably the best I have experienced so far. Now that\u2019s out of the way the camera is a good bang for your buck. Is it a iPhone camera? No! But it\u2019s still take good quality photos.Pros:1. The zoom does great and the clarity of the photos are clear and not pixelated2. Comes with a cool carrying case, two batteries and lenses cover.3. Takes cool photos and easily accessible with the SD card4. Light weight to carry with the case strap.5. Case protects the camera against fall.6. Comes with two batters and SD cardCons:1. No flip out screen of your into like vlogging and recording yourself2. No Wi-fi for wireless printing and uploading3. No separate battery changing option to have the back up battery charged if one die.All in all it\u2019s a solid camera for the buck. Great for beginner photography or hobby like activities. Understanding the great quality and customer service that comes with the camera is a no brainer. I would 10/10 recommend the camera to anyone who is looking for a good budget camera. I would give the camera a solid 8.5/10. The functionality is really easy to use also for those who might not be as tech savvy.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This camera reminds me of the good old days of film cameras. But there\u2019s a LOT more to it than in times past. I had been using an old Olympus digital camera, but the memory cards weren\u2019t available any more, and it finally bit the dust. I was looking to get another camera I could use whenever the situation presented itself. I do have an expensive camera, but it\u2019s got so many attachments it\u2019s hard to justify bringing it on a simple hike or a family gathering. This fills the bill and then some. It has all the digital effects you expect in a digital camera, like zoom and options like sepia, black and white, negative and many more. All the different settings for taking still pictures and videos are available to optimize your results, such as ISA, white balance, resolution, super sharp or blended focus, etc. More than I could describe here. The supplied memory card is more than enough to cover any photo shoot, but for about $20 you can get a 128 Gig micro SD card which you can use for long videos without worrying about running out of room. And you can select the resolution you want to conserve space if you need to. My old Olympus did not have sound, but this one does so you can film that birthday or beach party and capture all the excitement. Input for an external microphone is available if you want to do interviews or make high quality YouTube videos. A USB connection port is available to download your photos or videos, but I prefer to remove the SD card and put it directly into my computer. The 4k videos from this thing are amazing. I have a large screen monitor, and all the images look great! The colors are vibrant and clear, very lifelike. The battery life is very good, and you get an extra battery included. Included are aneck strap and carrying straps in addition to a leatherette cover. A few things I wish this was capable of are a close-up photo mode, external lenses, etc., but this camera is not really going to compete with the latest Canon or Nikon expensive professional cameras a photographer would use. This is a point-and-shoot camera that will probably have more use than those other ones because it\u2019s so easy to use. Once you set it up, just hit the power button and you\u2019re ready to shoot. You can view the subject from the big screen on the back, or look in the viewfinder to compose your shots. After taking your photos, you can show them on the screen, zoom in on the images, delete them, etc. Same for the videos.All in all, this is a very good option for saving those precious moments that seem to come as a surprise. You always have it ready when the time is right. The price is reasonable for what you get. I love this thing, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a good quality digital camera.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this 4K digital camera about 4 weeks ago so I could have a dedicated camera for my vlog. It has a blend of vintage aesthetics and modern technology. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the stylish leather carrying case which visually sets this camera apart from anything other modern cameras I\u2019ve seen recently around this price point. Since the camera offers a unique combination of manual and automatic features, making it versatile for both amateur and experienced photographers, it was a good choice for me with my intermediate skills.The Viewfinder and 16X Zoom with Autofocus make it easy for a non-professional photographer (like me) to easily snap pics. With 48MP it\u2019s more than enough to make my vlogging footage standout, plus it being point and shoot makes it\u2019s super easy to use for non-techie content creators.The camera comes with a drawstring protective pouch, a lanyard, a 32G card, 2 batteries, and a convenient USB cable for charging, which is handy when I\u2019m on-the-go or I haven\u2019t charged the backup battery. A 32G SD Card is provided so you can unbox this camera quickly and be ready to go! It camera has a HD, USB Type-C, and Mic input ports, perfect for capturing high-quality audio and video. The lightweight design makes it a travel-friendly companion. It won\u2019t add unnecessary weight to your bag, allowing you to take it with you wherever you go.While it\u2019s marketed as an excellent choice for vlogging, it\u2019s worth noting that it lacks Wi-Fi capability. This means you\u2019ll need a way to transfer your media off the SD card to a laptop, tablet, PC, Mac, or phone. Fortunately, there are various options available, including cables and adapters. Personally, I use an adapter that resembles a jump drive, connecting it to my iPhone and utilizing the SD slot for seamless transfers.Despite the absence of Wi-Fi connectivity, this camera shines in terms of its software and hardware. It offers a ton of filters, modes, and settings, catering to different photography styles and preferences. Additionally, it features a mounting connection point on the bottom on of the camera and the leather case (a design I haven\u2019t seen with other digital cameras).Most notably for me is this camera provides separation from your phone. It serves as a dedicated device allowing me to focus solely on photography or videography without distractions.I recommend this nostalgic 4K digital camera with vintage charm, manual and automatic capabilities, and a range of accessories as a solid choice for influencers, vloggers, or e-commerce business owners who need to photograph and/or video daily. While the lack of Wi-Fi might be an inconvenience, it\u2019s a feature rich camera and that makes up for it. I think it would be a valuable tool for content creators and photography enthusiasts alike.",

                "reviewText": "It's been a while since I've used a digital camera as almost everyone just uses their cellphones to take pictures/videos. I, as well, also just got used to taking pics/videos using my phone but I started having some itch in getting back to the days of digital cameras so I started looking for one. There were many of them available on Amazon but I found this product to be especially more appealing as it had a semi-vintage design of the digital cameras back in the mid 2000s. On top of the semi-vintage design appeal, it adds the 4K tech which is what I exactly wanted on a traditional digital camera. I remember when I used to buy digital cameras back in those days, it used to have a price tag of around $150-200 (if I remember correctly), and guess what, this camera is still around the same price range with brand new tech all added onto it, which is amazing.Another thing that I wanna talk about is the overall design and construction of the camera. I love how each function can be selected using the rotary wheel that makes it very easy to swipe through different functions (nowadays a lot of the cameras like GoPro have really finicky controls which makes it difficult to even navigate through menus and functions but in contrast, the wheel makes it very convenient). Aside from the wheel control, the overall weight is very manageable to carry around and it never bothered me for about a week of usage.I can't really speak for the vlogging perspective as I am not a vlogger nor a content creator, but I can see how this can be a very good option at a very reasonable price point for anyone getting into content-creating.Currently, I am using the camera to take pictures of products for my business and so far, the images have been flawlessly clear and sharp so that it makes my products look a lot better than my past pictures that I used to take with my cellphone camera.If anyone's in the market for a brand new camera, take this one in a heartbeat. Awesome quality camera with complimentary accessories like the cool-looking case with battery and a memory card. I think this is definitely in the top position in the category.",

The camera itself has a premium feel to it, with a body made of good quality materials yet lightweight which makes it easy to handle especially when taking videos with one hand. The camera quality is stunning especially for videos which was the primary purpose that I got this camera. The 4K video is crystal clear and sharp especially when displayed on a 4K screen. A nice touch is the added accessories which include a leather case, strap, extra batteries and a 32gb. Overall I am quite pleased with how this camera has turned out. For the price, it\u2019s a no brainer for anyone looking for an affordable yet high quality camera",
