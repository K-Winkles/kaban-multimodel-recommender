                "reviewText": "This NDI camera is a game changer for us given the features and price point. Unless your streaming situation allows for an operator physically controlling a high quality camcorder/dslr on a tripod, this NDI PTZ should be at the top of your list.Our church currently uses a Canon HF G21 with a bescor pan tilt mount that is captured using an Elgato Camlink and brought into OBS. I have two separate remotes to control the zoom and the pan/tilt mount as a result of this setup.As our streaming usage has grown over the years, I've wanted to address three areas of improvement:1. Have the video directly accessible on the network by multiple devices with low latency since we also broadcast the video locally with our in house audio. Putting the video on the network so it can be accessed by other devices is critical from a redundancy perspective so that our backup computers can stream if needed2. Save zoom and pan settings for three fixed locations we constantly use. Throughout the service we switch between three different areas. Our operators have to use the remotes to pan and zoom while running the other AV systems. Having preset settings that can be controlled at the push of a button would simplify things for the operator3. Improve low light quality. While I really wanted to go to a larger sensor device with removable lens, we don't have the man power or the space for someone to be at a camera throughout the service. Plus, we are a traditional worship and are not putting on pseudo concerts.The Avkans NDI camera checks all three boxes. NDI setup was straightforward for me. OBS was able to find the NDI stream once I put it on the network. In full disclosure, I am proficient with managing networks and have configured other NDI encoders and devices so I didn't find any of this particularly difficult.I purchased a huddlecam to use with the camera and it was plug and play. Saving zoom/pan/tilt presets worked right out of the box as did the manual joystick control. The motor is quiet and the pan tilt smoothness is comparable to our Bescor.Surprisingly, even though the sensor size of the Avkans (1/2.7\") and the Canon G21 (1/2.84\") are similar, and both lens are f1.8-2.8, the Avkans image is brighter and handles low light better. The image is also sharper despite the post-adjustments we do in OBS for the Canon.The cost of the Avkans camera is roughly equivalent to our current setup and is easily half the cost of other comparable PTZs. When you consider the fact that it not only replaces all of our existing functionality but adds NDI AND simplifies things for the operator, I wish we could've had this from the very beginning and used the extra money towards better lighting.Lastly, I did reach out to support when I was mounting the camera as I accidentally damaged the device. They were extremely responsive and worked with me to resolve the issue quickly. A lot of times warranty on products from overseas is useless but in this case the Avkans team aims to please.",

                "reviewText": "A little more than eight years ago my company built and implemented a live streaming system for the Parliament of my country. Since then we have not touched the system till now and with plans to go NDI we were looking for a cost-effective alternative to upgrade to. The system would also need to fit into the current eco-system we had (Sony MCS-8M Compact Switcher and the Sony RM-BR300 VISCA Remote Controller) until they were ready for the rest of the upgrade to come online. I came across PTZ Optics but then later found out that AVKANS are providing the exact camera for very cheap. Yesterday we installed them and here is a brief review;Pros:Picture Quality: We got the NDI 20x model and coming off of the old cameras we were very delighted to see the quality we got from this bottom-of-the-line version. The image was bright and clear and the saturation was just right from out of the box. Little to no adjusting is required and allowing the system to stay in auto seems like a great idea for new users;Build Quality: For a cheaper option, AVKANS does feel like a high-quality product. It's about 2kgs in hand and the metal seems like aluminium but does feel properly built, and sturdy. The I/O towards to rear does seem a bit flimsy to the eyes however since we've had a proper brand in Sony to see and feel the difference. Could it possibly be an issue for those working out of the box? Maybe, so if you are that kind of user I'd exercise extra caution while utilising the I/O.Reverse Compatible: The majority of the users might not be looking to add to their old setups like we did but, to know that it was sort of plug and play with our old equipment was quite perfect for us.Tech Support: Finally for the Pros, Tech Support. We made contact with AVKANS to find out if they had tested to see if the cameras would work with the Remote Controller and my e-mail was responded to in less than 24 hours. The representative was very friendly and even advised of the return policy where I'd receive 100% if it didn't work for that simple fact. One of my better experiences with sellers on Amazon for sure.Cons:Usability: It took us some time to get it set up. The manual didn't address the quality options outright and only until we turned the camera underside up that we saw what the options meant. Added to this, the turn-on sequence is long and lacks information. After the camera spins in its power-on self-test, it sits there for approximately 10-15 seconds to give a picture with it flickering once as if it's broken only to come on 5 seconds later with a full picture. A flashing on-screen message to your output source to say it's coming on will fix it.Control: I'm not sure if this is the Sony Controller behaving bad, but there is a lot of lethargic movement in the controlling of these cameras. It seems like there is a delay in the system utilising VISCA RS232C and though, again, it might be the Controller, I think I saw someone else complain about it being slow as well (not sure what controller he's on though).Zoom: The zoom also carries this lethargic feeling but added to this, the camera seems to lose focus while zooming and though it is quick to refocus, I don't think it should lose focus that much while zooming in. Maybe I'll have to review the settings to see if something can be changed here.All in all, we are looking forward to using these cameras in the system. So far, it's looking great, feels slow, but looks very good. We can't wait to get the entire NDI system complete and running, and we are very happy to have one essential item off the list thanks to AVKANS.",

I was impressed at the quality of the product, the ease of use and set up and the fact that it has excellent picture quality. We are not a large church and we were looking for an alternative camera for zoom streaming. I used the free NDI tools at https://ndi.tv/tools/ and it works great with this camera and the web camera utility allows it to be recognized by zoom. We also use the HDMI out to send the picture to an overflow room with a direct out from the sound board to allow live viewing of the service in another location. I would highly recommend this camera and will be looking to add a few more to use with OBS software for more sophistication in the live stream.",

                "reviewText": "The quality of the picture in 1080 is similar to the one from our existing camera (Canon Vixia HF G50 4K). The image is a bit sharper but probably only because we are closer (side camera at 1/3 instead of at the back center). I guess that if we would swap both camera, then the other one would become sharper.First, I have installed it over an HDMI extender (since it was already in place) but the image was blanking every few seconds or so). When I plug a monitor directly to trhe camera, I didn't have the problem.I then change the rate but I haven't tried it afterward on HDMI. I then plug it through NDI and the image was stable. However, I didn't find immediatly how to control the camera through PTZ. After listening a video on YouTube, we figured out that we can get the IT from the remote using a specific sequence (was not clear in the manual that we have to press each key in sequence and not at the same time).Then we put that IP on the computer and were able to control that camera with NDI. In Wirecast, we also have to select NDI in the PTZ window for preset to works.The manual was saying that we have to enter 192.168.100.88 but in fact it was not working and the camera seems to be configured with a dynamic address. Thus, we waste a lot of time because Avkans was to lazy to take a bit time properly explain that in the manuel or on the site.I have also adjusted the pan/tilt speed so that we can do slow scan between presets. This works between some presets but for others, it would be over uninteresting stuff while moving. Options seems to be much more limited that what seems available for PtzOptics or Canon PTZ from their web site. I would really hope we would have more flexibility to control the move between 2 presets.",
