I was sitting on the first row. It does not pick up colors. All costumes were whitish/blurry. Zoom was jerky and I couldn't find golden medium for me to cover the whole stage. It would either have too much on the sides or too close, so some of the performers were cut out. Quality of the video in general was very poor, pixelated, wrong colors. I don't even know where to start with the sound. I had mic connected. Sound was scratchy and poor clarity. Just to compare I used my phone to videotape actual performance from the exact same seat. Video was vastly different. Colors were bright and clear, sound had clarity, richness, and balance. So this camera is going back. I have no idea what other reviewers have bought, but I don't think it was this camera or they have never recorded anything.",

The touchscreen interface will take a bit to get used to, however the owners manual is very helpful. It comes with the external microphone and screen is able to turn around so you can record yourself easily. The quality of the video is great and records in 4K. In low light situations you need to purchase an external light/flash. I personally use a ring light.Upon reviewing the manual, I noticed you are able to use as a webcam as well. I WFH 3 days a week and have many calls with clients and when I used this camera instead of the work laptop it is such a great and impressive upgrade to quality.Overall quality for the price is great! I will recommend this to those who wanted to make content and those who need an upgrade for their current webcam if working from home.",
