                "reviewText": "I went through three other security camera vendors, all from \"top\" security camera companies found here on Amazon and in big box retailers, until I came across this security camera. This camera has by far met and exceeded my expectations.First, the price was the most competitive, even though I would be willing to pay more for a better quality camera and not waste my time trying to find the right one. Next, the ease of installation and image quality/ pan feature was above all the others (one other cameras even had silly/ childish voices congratulating you on the installation process). I also liked that you can make a recording setting to allow the camera to record after it stops sensing motion activity. Several of the cameras I tried did not allow this. This camera allows you to use a SD card to store your images, not playing a game that you have to upload your videos to their web and then pay a monthly/ hidden fee.Finally, what I really like is you can load the app on your phone but also on a Mac or PC (I think) and view the videos from your laptop, all the others didn\u2019t allow me to do this.. Streaming/ viewing the images can be sometimes slow and jittery, but that may even be my Internet connect. If you are patient, it will load/ store on the app and then you can see the video with no issues.",

                "reviewText": "Was relatively easy to install and pair to the app on my phone. Quality is good enough for keeping an eye on the house. They offer 1 month renewable cloud storage (so you have to renew each month, but it's free so you can't beat that).Edit: Months later cloud storage no longer recognized camera and would not allow me to add it again. Months after that wifi connection keeps failing. I tried restarting camera, resetting router, hard reset of camera (only to be unable to add camera due to wifi connection failing). I noticed troubleshooting mentions wifi password cannot have special characters. Ours does and it had worked fine until then. I sent message 1 week ago through their customer support form on their website and no response.. Pretty disappointed in customer service and the fact that this camera has become useless. Very frustrating having to wait to get support (and not being able to speak to a person to resolve it immediately). Considering cameras are used for security, I'm not sure I would recommend this anymore.Edit #2: Support did contact me back and we worked through the problem. Our wifi has split 2.4 and 5ghz bands. Both are named the same thing and after an internet outage it looks like the camera was trying to connect to the 5ghz. I had to rename the 2.4 ghz and reconfigure the connection on the camera.",

                "reviewText": "It is a very simplistic wireless camera. Will not knock your socks off, but doesn't really disappoint either. The video quality is \"blah\", but good enough to see all that is needed. Fine detail in video will not be found. Sound quality is weak, but good enough to understand what is being said, and communicate 2-way. Adjusting camera in real time isn't all that bad surprisingly. There is a normal delay in moving the camera angle as expected, considering if you are across the country even, and the lag is only a few seconds. Night vision is very good. I believe the night vision exceeds expectations for this little, less expesnsive device. a little more detail in picture quality than color/daylight at times.The big downfall I had with this device is motion detection. Seems the camera detects light intensity changes within the room a bit too easily. I have curtains and blinds, and still the sun going in an out from behind the clouds trips the motion sensor, regardless of what sensitivity I select. Room gets brighter then darker, the camera sees it. Constantly sends me notifications on my phone and recording to SD card.Camera takes a micro-SD card. Does not come with one, you need to buy it. No larger than 32Gb. App downloaded to phone is very easy to use, no frills, and basic. Settings easy to figure out.Setting up the unit is a hassle if you have dual band router. Select the 2.4ghz band, not the 5ghz. It will not recognize the 5Ghz band properly, consistently, nor reliably. A very simply setup process altogether, after that. Any issues will likely be getting the camera and router to recognize one another - remember, 2.4Ghz and your router password is the key!All in all, I would purchase again for cheap video monitoring of each room. I disconnect each one till I need them. When needed, plug back in, and they will connect shortly to your network and you can access all cameras on your phone within a few minutes. I would not pay any more than $35-$40 for this unit, as I believe this is it's limit in terms of overall quality.",
