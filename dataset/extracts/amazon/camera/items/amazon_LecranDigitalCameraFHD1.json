The photo quality is adjustable depending on what you\u2019re wanting. They also take videos and have a speaker for playback. All in all a good choice is you want a first camera.",

It comes with the camera obviously, battery, memory card, case with a hanger to carry around and put on your torso, a guide for the instructions, and a paper to clean the lenses. What I love about this product is that there's is a variety of colors I can choose from. I got the pink one and it's such a light, sweet pink. The camera is absolutely beautiful and it's easy to use. I also love this camera a lot because I can connect it to my computer to see a closer view of the pictures. Again it has such amazing quality and would definitely buy again. I have used it so much ever since I got it for my birthday. Definitely will be taking it to my trip to Hawaii for summer and definitely would recommend. So glad I bought this item. \ud83d\udc9e",
