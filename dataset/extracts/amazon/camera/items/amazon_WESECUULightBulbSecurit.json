I was not able to find the QR to get the correct app to run it. (The SD card still bothering me) as I worried if I got to run dirt water/snow and spiders who love my Xmas lights and more all a issue. So I started to contact customer support offered. But didn't get thru. I feel a falure at this and yet. I need to get this up so when random doorbell rings I know if I need to drag my painful and injured body to the door. Must have it soon. Ugh it what I say after the recent attempt to get it up and running before I have someone wire up a receptacle to exterior area (or more as I hoped,)Please note per me. I'm not feeling well recently and if I'm wrong by not getting customer service care support it's my fault. But also....as with other items with poor or lesser than helpful instructions this is also poorly explained.**Maybe Amazon might require better or assist these non English companies in better paperwork of value.Sadly this is the way of the future...if not..ButI wonder if it will work?Update....No never got it to work.Finally repacked in its box.Now it's just 23 bucks wasted in a small box sitting here...(Notes. I was offered a replacement by seller, I guess as a side deal??? I wasn't sure what they were offering or how. But it didn't seem to fit with in Amazon rules. So I didn't know what to do.I guess they did make very nice offers to me to get a working unit. Wish I had known what to do and how. I'm not greedy and didn't want to cause issue. But I guess I should have tried to find out how to get a working unit.They were very nice.It really came down to the app that was needed to run device. The QR code on camera body didn't get me to a place to get the app. It was just dead end QR code I guess.Still the SD card slot wouldn't fair to well in rain, snow, dirt and bugs.Sometimes you lose money. I just have to forget about this item.ButI should have been able to get it running fairly quickly. Most others I've read about did.So I still think it is the QR code on body of Camera.(Really needed this or 2 to workEspecially post surgery to know to get to door or not)",

                "reviewText": "For $20, this camera is totally worth it. Even if it were a dummy camera, it would have been worth $20!!! I ran an extra outlet and socket, installed the hardware, and did the software setup in under an hour. I love the ability to rotate and adjust the height of the camera. I am also really impressed with the zoom ability. I am going to be putting up a couple more! Even if it lasted a year, it\u2019s totally worth it. Update. The second camera I received did not work quite right. They sent a replacement with a return. The system works great with SD card and with its app. I can now watch my packages any time from anywhere.",

The view of this camera is magnificent crystal clear! I had a few friends that fell in love with this camera and they have Vivint(I think it\u2019s called) Ring and ADT and they don\u2019t have the clarity as my front door screw in camera! We all watched others arriving as my camera alerted me and tracked 2 people to my door at night! I love the light from this camera leaving no doubt who is arriving! The light from this camera shown across the street brightly! It is wonderful and I want another for my backyard! Thank you very much! OOH! The voice activation is a marvel\ud83e\udd23! They could hear me clearly as I heard them inside having a conversation to my door! I am very happy and pleased with this camera!",
