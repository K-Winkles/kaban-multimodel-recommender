I purchased this camera to use for my Japan vacation. It's perfect for any type of photo, and the screen is crisp and clear. I am impressed with the portability and lightweight design. I also love it comes with 2 batteries, a strap, dust bag, and a lens cap and 64 GB as well. It's stylish enough that when I'm not snapping photos, it easily blends in as a chic decoration on my shelf. Everything is straightforward and didn\u2019t take me long to figure out all its settings and features. I randomly took a picture of my dog the quality of the picture is way better than I expected. I really love the old style picture.",

I wanted something easy to use, easy to carry, with quality video and sound.The video is fine but the audio is unusable, awful, terrible. Maybe the one I got was defective. At first I tried it doing the way I've done it with other cameras and phones. I set it right on the piano and it sounded like the most grungy, distorted metal guitar you've ever heard. So I was disappointed but thought, well, ok, if it has to a few yards away, I can mange. So I set it up across the room, at about 15' away, on a soft surface, and still, the sound was AWFUL. Still distorted but not as bad but strangely during playback the sound keeps hesitating, hiccupping, if you will. WTH? I've never seen anything like it and I've been using point and shoot cameras for this purpose for 20 years. ugh I'm returning it immediately.",

It has a lot of options and I haven't explored them all but I was surprised to see burst shots, slow motion videos, and able to change from night, to back-lit, portraits, landscapes, etc within the camera. It does great for still photography and we enjoyed taking it on a hike with us. There is just a little lag time for fast action but we were also trying to take photos of very fast dirtbikes racing at the time. I'm not sure I could catch them well with a more advanced camera either, personally. I'd also like to mute the sound for menu changes which I'm sure can happen but that doesn't hamper the use of the camera overall. Easy to hold, came with everything you need from charger, double batteries, lens cover, carry case, wristlet, etc.",
