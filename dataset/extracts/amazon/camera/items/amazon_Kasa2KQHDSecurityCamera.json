Can also move the camera within the app. The SD card entry slot is hidden under the black camera. Roll the camera upwards and the slot is under there. No instructions came in the box except to download the app so, I had to look in the listing to figure that out. Picture is crisp and clear. Can turn audio, 24/7 recording, motion sensor, and volume on/off/up/down very easily. Can subscribe to the recording option to be able to access the snapshots of activity. Subscripton price is reasonable at $3/month or $30/year. So far, everything works, including the subscription options. 1 month free trial was provided. I will update this review in a few months or as needed.",

Not only did my blink require a subscription to record and save video but it didn\u2019t move and the camera quality was crap, and it always disconnected from my internet. This solved all of my problems, better quality, it\u2019s moves around from your phones control, it\u2019s video quality is better, and no subscription is needed for recording and storing data, all you need is a micro usb!! Very happy I grab this. It was extremely easy to install. 10/10 recommend and for a fantastic price.",

                "reviewText": "Of all the cheap ($30-$40 range) cameras I've bought, this one has lasted longer than the other ones which usually stop working in less than a year. It's pretty easy to set up and easy to turn on or off from home or away on your phone. The memory card is not included but great to buy for recording and to watch footage back. The night vision is good and the regular daytime footage is very clear. The only thing I don't like about it is when you use the microphone it makes a super loud noise before you talk that scares my cats everytime. I tried turning the volume down in the settings but it doesn't change.",

The picture quality is good enough and we really like that it swivels to show us our whole apartment. The app is easy enough to use and we won't be getting rid of this device any time soon.

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent value for a very versatile and feature packed remote camera.",
                "reviewText": "These cameras are excellent! The price paid is minimal compared to the total amount of functionality.They do track objects that trigger them, maybe not as smoothly as higher priced options (I don\u2019t know, have not tried others).For the mobility of relocating the camera by simply picking it up and finding a new location, it\u2019s massively more practical than the full wired systems available. Until you know where you want those more expensive cameras to be permanently installed, these cameras are a great alternative! Also, great for keeping a watch on who\u2019s passing by your place at window-level.Wired cameras have to be mounted high enough to be safe from getting ripped down by trespassers, these see through windows during the day very well. Interior night vision is top notch, seeing outside through windows at night is more difficult.With the sensitivity turned up, every time a tree branch blows it triggers the cameras. This leads to near constant triggering of alerts during the late Spring, Summer and early Fall.And, lots of recordings every day. So, you need to use the App to designate areas to watch for motion, or it\u2019ll drive you nuts and frustrate you. To the point that you may start to ignore the notices.The App provides great control, and allows remote on/off, sensitivity setting changes, you can set to record noise triggers or remove that, set trigger zones, move the camera via the App, and other adjustments.I have noticed that the App actually does offer more functions, and work a little more smoothly, through my phone than my very new tablet. No idea why, it should be the same App for both platforms, no?But, of course watching the playback on the larger screen is so much better, so I do use both.The service plan allows storage of recordings from up to 10 cameras for $10 per month. Much more cost effective than others I looked into.The cons:Can\u2019t see thru glass with the built-in lights, at night. Reflection off the glass blinds the camera.That should have been obvious to me from the start, since these are designed for indoor use only. but I had naively hoped for better night vision performance.So, if looking out a window, get a motion-activated light to trigger so you can see what\u2019s going on out there. Just don\u2019t set it up where it will shine in your bedroom and wake you up.App functionality on phone is higher than on tablet, no idea why. You will want to have the App on at least a phone, if not both.Sometimes, some cameras will trigger, others won\u2019t, for the same event.Deer moving around the house sometimes are ignored by one camera, recorded by another. Also happened that another outdoor camera from another manufacturer recorded a vehicle trespassing, these cameras didn\u2019t. Had to adjust the sensor sensitivity, but I think the baseline software settings should be set to trigger sooner on vehicles.Branches moving on the breeze cause constant notices, even with Person Detection Mode activated.A more elaborate software system might offer better monitoring, but for the pro systems, this requires fully wired systems with dedicated main recording components/control systems . Much more expensive, and I can\u2019t afford to open the walls throughout the property.Overall, these are great! I have bought several models, both the fixed ones and the bigger moving ones. All look great when set to the highest recording resolution, seem to last a long time, and are a breeze to set up or switch from spot to spot.I very much recommend this camera! I also hope the manufacturer can produce a 4K version.",

                "reviewText": "I should of picked the cheaper camera, but thought the 2k one would be better. Unfortunately, the 2k option on the camera does not save recordings to the sd card. So I have to use the video quality of the cheaper camera option for any videos to save. Also, they need more instructions, it took a minute to find the sd card slot, and it wouldn\u2019t read the sd card until I held down the reset button next to the card slot. All in all, the camera is good for the price. 2k quality definitely not needed, so save those few extra dollars and get the cheaper option. You can see very clearly without the 2k. The night vision on this is amazing as well. This has better video quality than baby monitors, trail cameras, and any security cameras I\u2019ve seen. Oh! One more thing. It\u2019s delayed by at least 30 seconds. So any movement is actually a little behind. Other than that, pretty good.",

Used with the Kasa phone app this is a great monitoring solution. I added an inexpensive micro SD card for recording. You can setup multiple viewing angles to quickly survey the area remotely when required. It will automatically notify your phone when motion is detected and the recording allows to review the activity. Thankfully, so far it has only seen the occasional moth. It has saved me many trips up to the attic and has worked well for many months. I also have many kasa wifi light and outlet switches which also work very well. This is an excellent product.",
