Also included is a battery and a cable & charging block if you want to charge it using a wall socket, but it can also be charged from the computer/laptop. Best of all I don\u2019t worry as much about her breaking it or losing it. Great way for her to capture memories with her friends and learning and experimenting with photography.",
