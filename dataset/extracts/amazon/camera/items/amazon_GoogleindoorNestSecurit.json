They will link you with virtual tech and add about a $10 monthly charge per item to your ADT bill. They will not monitor camera as this is an invasion of privacy. I understand. Then why the upcharge? Will seriously need to rethink my home monitoring system.",

We can pull instant replay on the kids when they misbehave. We can speak to them when they are on other rooms. The cheap subscription cost for the upgraded features make it easy and cost-effective to expand coverage. I'll be placing these on price alerts for additional future purchase. Great image and sound quality. Fantastic recognition features. Great image angles. Quality hardware. There should be no complaints from reviewers. Those are probably user error.",

If you're using it for a room that's relatively small or medium sized, then you will like it. I don't like that it does not connect to the nest app because the nest app I feel was better than Google home. Google home will soon get the same software buttons that are on nest",
