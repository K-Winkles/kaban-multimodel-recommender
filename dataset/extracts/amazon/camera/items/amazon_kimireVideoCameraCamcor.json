                "reviewText": "Ok, been a few months and too many YT videos. Mostly ranch-related, wildlife to indoor stuff but also hack film projects. Very happy with performance; works well; above-average accessories (xtra battery; cords, etc.) I film way too much stuff but in a filmable area to put it lightly so carried on hikes, in garden, around farm; good and compact and ok after inevitable drop or two. (Results may vary on latter!)Gripes. Most perhaps \"git off my lawn\" old man stuff:G1: The main \"Start recording/stop\" most popular button is a good size but, me at least, never have an easy time with it. Doesn't seem to respond each time or must push harder than you'd think, thus fumbling with the compact size and always accidentally touching other buttons (that don't trigger anything but still). May be me. Adult male but Nosferatu hands (say what?).G2. The \"night mode\" night vision seems no different than reg and pretty useless beyond very close things that may be illuminated by the 3 tiny little lights that then come on. The cheaper one this replaced had amazing NV; got to read fine print on that. Note: all this general hobby; no big deals. So bought an \"average\" Amazon camcorder; not cheapest but dang close. This was discounted so another \"step up\" but not much. Seems better quality than last but prefer old one, no offense to this perfectly-functional one.G3. \"Dang, Ethel! You'd expect the nifty case provided to FIT the dang thing!\" Ok, it DOES but not with the battery that extends its length enough so it won't fit in the case. BUT (git off my ... oh. did that) after I stubbornly jammed it in a few times, it stretched out. So like a new sock perhaps that needs a little pull. Moot in practice as I usually want if available faster so just put in a pocket. NOTE:NOTHING NEGATIVE to it's reason for existence. Good value. Working great and happy with it. I know there are different forms of NV, few really the tech version so perhaps this just has a closeup or diff version I did not clue into and/or some control combo also missed. IT WORKS WELL FOR PRICE.Rest pretty good. I wish the port for the memory card allowed a little more room to grab the damn thing but that's standard with all devices now (git off my lawn!). Pics are screenshots so cam's results may be better vs what shows up here. I like the options of a super HD, reg HD and VGA.",

Literally did everything I could to fix it, and nothing worked. It's genuine junk, and the only thing it's useful for is using it as a prop or letting a child play around with it to pretend it works. I don't know how on earth some people are rating it 5 stars, and I believe very soon the camera will give out on them and they'll too regret purchasing this trash. Please, save your money and buy a different one. I don't think it gets any worse than this. If you decide to proceed with buying this camcorder after seeing all the low reviews like this one, don't say we didn't warn you.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Good for the price but also you get what you pay for",
                "reviewText": "Just to give some background, I was looking for an inexpensive video to do vlogging type stuff and take some videos with my dog. I don't have much experience with more expensive camcorders or what kind of technology and features you can expect if you paid 150 200 dollars, but TL;DR this is neat for the price and gives you a compact HD picture that is pretty good and it is cool that it has the video screen and an extra battery. The menus are fairly easy to figure out after a couple of minutes of poking around.So anyways my criticisms, you have to buy an SD card which is not that big of a deal but you want to be aware of it before you start to use it. Apparently it only holds up to 32gb which is not that big especially with how fast video file sizes add up, so it's probably better to make small clips and not expect to make a huge 2 hours video. With that being said I don't know about how other cameras and their storage work so it might not be too bad.The USB technology seems kind of old but also it charges the battery pretty good so not really any complaints. I was not expecting USB C connections or anything for the price. I have not used it as a webcam, but you will probably want to get an inexpensive tripod to do that which is more extra money you have to add on depending on the reasons you bought it to begin with.My major complaints and the reason for the 3 stars is it consistently freezes on me and I have to reset it. It might be because the battery connection comes apart for a second or just because the software quality, but it may be an issue you have that costs you when trying to record at the perfect moment. Also, the sound quality / microphone is pretty bad. One annoying thing is when pressing the zoom buttons on the top you hear it on the video very loudly so you will definitely want to edit the final product or have your zoom level figured out before you start recording. Also because it is so small I found it more difficult to keep it steady and smaller movements show up more. Anyways I still recommend it but if you need more than the bare minimum to record videos there are probably way better options for 50-100 dollars more.",
