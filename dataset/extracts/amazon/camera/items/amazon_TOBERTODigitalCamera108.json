                "reviewText": "This camera is awesome! I use it on my motorcycle on the chin part. I ride my motorcycle every single day, I use it for insurance purposes. Nowadays everyone drives while on their phone and it is really bad for us motorcyclists. This helmet gives me ease of mind for a fraction of the price of a GoPro. The video quality is excellent and it is very easy to use. It is 110 percent worth it for the price. I bought extra batteries since it come with two and I need up to 5 or 6 hours of record time consecutively. If you think this is not a high quality camera then you are probably a professional photographer with thousands and thousands of dollars of equipment. Is it equivalent? No. You get what you pay for but technology has advanced so much that yes you can get a great gopro style camera for $60. This one!",

                "reviewText": "I currently own 3 of these great action cameras, I use them primarily for my fishing YouTube Videos. I have found them to be better suited than the GoPro Hero cameras, at less than 1/3 the cost. The video quality is very impressive . I use them mounted on a chest mount,bass boat, kayak accessory rail, etc to film my fishing videos. I also have made me a underwater extension mount from PVC and have 1 dedicated to underwater shots of the rivers, lakes that I fish to get the action shots of fish being caught. I would highly recommend these cameras to anyone who is in the market for a very good quality action camera. I would rather have 3 great cameras to capture my videos and fishing moments as to have 1 Big Name brand camera is in my opinion inferior and overpriced. Being a mechanical engineer in the automotive industry for the past 25+ years I am used to quality products and therefore I am very pleased with my purchases of these cameras. Fact being if I was not pleased I would not have bought 3 of them and be planning on at least 2 more this year.",

                "reviewText": "I got this a day ago and after getting my sd card, decided to test it out. When set to 12 mp, the pictures were not that great at all. I tried in low light, with the light on the camera, and natural light from outside; all completely terrible (worse than an iPhone SE). So I tried upping it to 36 mp and it was just as terrible. Seems that the camera still takes 12mp shots, just increases the resolution.I wouldn't buy, worse picture quality than an average cell phone.",

                "reviewText": "Camera does not have a very good instructional manual nor is there any online manual or assistance. The camera does not take clear photos and the flash is almost non- existent. I needed a simple to use replacement camera for my Canon Cool Pix camera and this is not it. No matter how I hold it or secure it, the photos are not clear. Nighttime photos are really terrible. It is not a good value for the money. Suggest you spend a little extra and get a better camera. I have learned my lesson here.",

                "reviewText": "\" I was looking for a camera for my 11 yrs old and wanted to stay away from any major brand as he is just a beginner and wanted to learn. After few days of use, I found this much suitable for him. It has not that much functions but for beginners this is great. It comes with all the basic functions ISO, different modes, digital zoom etc. Picture quality is also good especially during day time photography. My kid is doing school projects as the school season is starting soon. Battery life is good as well.I would suggest don't compare this with major brands when you look at the price. At then end of the day it fulfilled what I needed and my kid is happy.The only thing is, it doesn't come with memory card and you have to buy it separately. I used the card from my other camera. Satisfied with the purchase. \"",

This let a hit and run get away.Also intermittently saves rear video files. Not predictable or reliable. No issue with saving front cam files.",

My room is quite a ways away from hers in the house and the receiver projects the data that far and so clearly. It is so much easier for me to sleep know that I can hear everything that happens with my little girl throughout the night. If she has a bad dream and wakes up in the middle of the night, I immediately hear her cries and can be there for her in an instant. I have not had to replace anything and have never had any tech issues with this product. For the price, this was definitely one of the best investments I have ever made. I can't recommend this product to other parents enough. It has saved me a world of trouble and a ton of money.",
