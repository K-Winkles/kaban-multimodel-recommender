I researched and read dozens and dozens of reviews for many cameras like this one. After reading reviews, I decided on this one because of the price, quality of the pictures, and user-friendly, specifically for children. This was a nonstop favorite for about four days straight after my daughter opened it. She\u2019s eight years old and between her and my two other children, they went through an entire role of paper in two days! Nothing to worry about though because it came with two other rolls and the price for replacement is very very budget friendly! After reading other reviewers, it helped cut the time it took to figure out the best image settings in no time. Since then she has carried it around with her wherever we go ready to take photos. I big selling point for me on this one was the quality of the photos when they came out. I greatly appreciate other reviewers attaching a photo example with their reviews. For being a thermal printer, I thought it was excellent image quality!",

I never had time to read the instruction book for the MP3 or games features - they just jumped to it and started taking photos. The photos are clear enough but not polaroid-style quality (almost gives it an artsy quality, especially when they color in the black & white printouts). Charges easily. Comes with plenty of printing paper, and I like seeing what they choose to take photos of in their little world. Excellent gift for any kid old enough to point & shoot a camera right up to high-school aged.",
