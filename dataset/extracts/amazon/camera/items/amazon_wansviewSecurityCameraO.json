                "reviewText": "This inexpensive budget W9 outdoor cam packs a lot nice features, e.g. continuous live recording, 1080p HD video, camera 350 degrees panning, tilting & zooming, microSD up to 128 GB storage (a cheaper option than cloud subscription), alerts from motion detection, great night vision, 2-way talk, etc.The W9 camera uses USB-C/adaptor plug-in (not water-proof), so be sure that the connection to a power outlet is in a covered or sheltered location. The camera is fairly easy to set up using the Wansview app. However, the little instruction booklet is practically useless because of the tiniest print size and some pictures are not even viewable with a magnifying glass. This is the single most frustrating thing and I almost wanted to return the camera but I downloaded the instruction in 8\" X 11\" page format from the website and was able to quickly complete the setup.The mounting screws are included in the box but the angle (bad design) of the screw holes are slanted that would result in rounding the phillips screw head. The solution is to pre-drill the holes before installing the screws.If you run into any problems, don't hesitate to contact Wansview Support that has excellent friendly and timely customer service. This is great camera for under $40 (on sale) so I bought another one and control both cams on the same app.",

                "reviewText": "I bought four of these cameras and have been using them for about four months. They are a great value for the price and meet my needs well. Daytime picture quality is good (not really high resolution but good enough for my needs). Night vision is quite good as well. I can control pan/tilt from the Android App easily and setup was easy. My only complaint is the Windows App for the camera. Sometimes I want to monitor the cameras on my laptop in my office. But the Windows App for this camera does not allow you to look at recordings (the Android App does). So if an alarm gets activated while I am at my laptop, I have to go to the phone to take a look at what happened. I wish they would fix the Windows App to be able to view recording.May 9 2022. have been using the cameras for a few months now. cameras work fine in terms of daytime and night time vision and clarity of pictures. However, supporting infrastructure is problematic. Windows app still does not allow me to view recordings (you can only view recordings from a phone). And for the last two weeks, my windows app will not let me log into the server to view livestream video - it keeps saying \"server busy try again\". I don't know what the problem is. Also be aware that this camera works only on 2GHz band. if your router is dual band (2/5GHz), sometimes the camera gets confused and can hang up. then you have to reset.April 21 2023. The camera works well. However, the company does not make clear that you can only view the images/videos from your phone (Android or IOS). They used to have a windows app, but it does not work any more. Also, over the last two months, their server has failed for extended periods of time. So you cannot view images on your phone either during those times.April 23 2023. Just upgraded my rating from three to four stars. I am quite impressed with their technical and customer support. Two days ago, when all my cameras stopped working, i suspected a server problem at their end and notified them. They got back this morning saying the server problem has been fixed, and yes the cameras are working fine now. Things can always go wrong, but I greatly appreciate the company's prompt attention to the problem and taking care of it.",
