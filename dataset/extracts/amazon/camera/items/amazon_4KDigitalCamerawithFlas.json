                "reviewText": "4K Digital CameraBought this camera in hopes of having an inexpensive camera to just keep in my vehicle and have at the ready. However was quickly disappointed that this camera lacks basic camera controls. Unless I missed it in the functions menu, there is no way to control the ISO, F stop or shutter speed.The only thing that comes close to \"control\" is an exposure compensation.It does have a very high mega pixel rating, but not easily accessible. I took a video and some photos and tried to download them off of the memory card (32gb tf card included), but after about 15 minutes and numerous attempts, gave up. I was able to get one image, which I will share in this post. Every time I tried, it just locked up the directory. So I had to disconnect the camera from usb on computer and start over. After 5 or 6 attempts, I gave up. Tried moving images, right clicking to save and then copy to a directory on computer, all attempts failed.Tried to use it as a web cam (as this is one of the options in menu) but that didn\u2019t show up anywhere on computer. So if there is a process that is different, the manual doesn\u2019t speak to that.I saw the other reviews of this camera and my experience is completely contrary to those reviews. Maybe it is just a compatibility with my computer, I have a very powerful 8 core processor running at 3GHz with 24 GB of ram and multiple hard drives. So in every other chore, my computer works fine. Just apparently not compatible with my system. The one photo I did manage to download is clear, but over exposed. Again, with no normal basic controls, you get what you get.dDisappointed and gave up.Hope this helps.",
