                "reviewText": "I often at times do not get the opportunity to write reviews, especially this soon after I have made a purchase, but felt compelled to write a review about this great little device. When I researched tools to guard or to aid in protecting your safety, I came across this. I had already been aware of these devices being used by law enforcement, but was not aware that they were available for civilians as well. I wanted to be for certain prior to buying one, so I searched through some of the reviews and found that they are not only for those individuals but anyone, and are being used for the same purpose I have in mind. Being a woman and concerned for my safety, especially during these times and with also having had many, many matters to occur in the past with traveling alone, exercising, going about running errands and minding my own business will serve as a great tool to aid in addition to other devices and/or tools I have such as mace, stun gun, etc., in keeping me safe and protected from uncomfortable/threatening situations, trouble makers and dishonest people.I know a lot of people have in mind, well why not just use your phone to record if you feel threatened or unsafe? Not often at times this is an option, especially if you do not have the time to find your phone or have it handy in a threatening or uncomfortable encounter. This recording device is made specifically to securely wear on your person without being easily removed and also creates less of a hassle if you have to be hands free to defend yourself or immediately leave an unsafe situation while keeping track of anything that is going on or has taken place. I tested it out and it works very well. It has a lot of great features.",

                "reviewText": "This is an updated review from my first review that was a 1-start ONLY because the device didn't work due to memory card defect. However, upon connecting with customer support about the issue, they quickly sent me a replacement device and that one worked as advertised. I tested the device from full charge, running non-stop video/audio, until full dead. I checked the video quality and audio quality. Here are my results. Video is about as best you can do for 1080p. For accountability in assisted living situations, like mine, it records everything no problem. For an impressive 10 hours, 25 minutes before dying. The software automatically increments the breakpoints at around 1.2gb per file. Total of about 40gb per 10 hours, 25 mins. The audio is good for other people. For the person wearing, its almost over modulated due to mic sensitivity. So no need to wear it close to neck. Maybe mid chest is good enough. Plug in to computer to pull files. They read well. But biggest plus is customer service. Having a product like this, you want someone to be able to replace if you need to submit warranty issue especially in assisted living. we dont have time for delays, so i appreciate them being on top of things. So, i updated my review to 5 star mostly due to customer service, and of course the device does work as advertised.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a 'dash cam' for when I ride my bicycle. I mounted one of the Boblov clips to the front of my helmet with velcro and zip ties, and it works GREAT for bicycling and taking video for bicycling! I'm sure there are a lot of good ways to mount it, but this method was pretty good for stabilizing the video (as opposed to clipping to your shirt and riding). Most of the time, I'm able to make out license plates. I usually run it on 720p. Battery life is good and usually last several hours. Recordings at night are a tad less clear, but still very good. I think this is an excellent cheaper alternative for a monitoring camera for bicycling. The video loop records and retains several trips worth of footage. It records over old video when it fills up. It has a wide angle/view (kind of like fish eye, but not quite). It is an excellent camera.",
