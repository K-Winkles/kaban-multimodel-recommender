SR AUTO & Detection Functions Equipped with SR AUTO, an auto 6 scene-recognition function with fully loaded detection functions that detect faces, blinks and smiles for clear optimized people photos. 6 Scene SR AUTO (Scene Recognition Auto) Framed scenes are automatically detected and selected into appropriate camera settings: Portrait, Landscape, Night, Macro, Night Portrait, and Backlit Portrait. Portrait: Recognizes portraits by detecting the faces quickly in the frame and optimizing focus, brightness and white balance. Landscape: Scenic shots such as mountains and buildings are automatically recognized. Colors of the sky, forests, and flower fields are captured in vivid colors and depth. Night: For low-light and night-time scenarios, shutter speed and sensitivity are automatically adjusted, producing blur-free pictures with minimal noise. Macro: Macro mode sets the focusing position of the details of small flowers or tiny subjects accurately. Night Portrait: When photographing people at night or in low light, SR AUTO optimizes flash range, shutter speed, and exposure of the portraits, while capturing smooth and luminous background. Backlit Portrait: Optimizes brightness of the faces that usually end up in shadow and underexposure caused by the light behind. Face Detection Face Detection optimizes people pictures by detecting faces and adjusting focus and exposure to ensure bright, clear results. Red-eye Removal in Detected Faces Red-eye removal automatically detects and corrects flash reflection for a perfect end result. Instantly Detect up to 10 Faces The Face Detection can simultaneously recognizes up to 10 faces in a photo. Share your group portraits using the Zoom Up function in playbacks, checking each detected face. Each priceless expression can be cropped and saved in clear high resolution results. Blink Detection The camera will warn you when people in the frame are blinking, giving you the option to retake the photo, or enlarge the face so you can save or delete the image before you take the next shot. Smile & Shoot Mode The Smile & Shoot mode of Scene Position, automatically releases the shutter when the smile appears so you won't miss the adorable smile the moment they happen. Motion Panorama Lets you take panorama photos as simply as 1, 2, 3! The camera automatically stitches together three consecutive shots, with simple in-frame guidance to ensure the images are aligned. The resulting image is saved to the memory card as an impressive panorama. Natural Light and with Flash Can't decide whether it's best to use flash? Choose this mode, press the shutter and automatically capture the same scene twice: once with high sensitivity and natural light, and the second time with Intelligent Flash. Later choose one or keep both! Tracking Auto Focus Keeps fast moving subjects in the frame and in focus, even when the zoom is fully extended. Great for capturing dynamic close-ups. Instant Zoom A function to follow moving subjects in standard wide view for easy framing at high zoom settings. With a single press of a button, the subject tracked within the selected frame on the LCD, will be captured and saved at a high zoom ratio (1.4x or 2.0x digital zoom). Zoom Bracketing Mode Enables three shots to be taken at the single press of the button, at varying degrees of magnification (original, 1.4x and 2.0x). This enables instant editing on the camera to choose the ideal shot, rather than having to go back to a PC to facilitate a digital crop. Date Stamp Function Shooting date and time can be embedded in the lower right-hand corner of the image files.

                "reviewText": "Received this camera two days ago. I have only owned regular digital point-and-shoot cameras in the past. With the recent birth of our son, we wanted to upgrade our camera to something better. We looked at SLR cameras, but even the cheapest ones were more expensive than we were willing to pay. We decided to get a \"bridge\" camera, and after pouring through reviews and feature lists we decided on the Fujifilm S4200.With both my wife and I being novices when it comes to photography, we wanted something that would take excellent pictures on Auto. We are very pleased with the picture quality on Auto, the pictures are much more clear than any previous camera we've owned, and the flash is excellent. Pictures taken with flash look great and don't have that blown out look that photos taken with flash do on cheaper cameras. This camera is very intuitive and easy to use- the options are there if you care to delve into them, but if you're just looking for a camera that performs well out of the box, this fits the bill as well.I've taken close to 100 pictures over the last few days and the batteries are still going, so the battery life seems decent. The camera itself is pretty light, and we really like the grippy textured rubber on the outside of the camera. Pictures in low light and indoors are good, and it also takes pretty decent photos with the flash off. The camera takes pictures fairly quickly, I think its about 3 or 4 seconds between shots which is pretty good judging by reviews I read for other cameras in the same class taking upwards of 10 seconds. The 24x zoom is excellent as well, very cool feature.Overall I would definitely recommend this camera, but keep in mind that my wife and I are novice photographers and are just judging the picture quality and performance subjectively. Although with all of the options this camera has, I'm sure a more seasoned photographer would enjoy it as well.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a camera I could use to take photos of birds/nature, and bought this one because I read a review that said this one was a great choice for that purpose. I'm pleased to report that review was right on the money!PLUS--1. This camera is very easy to use: you can basically point and shoot, and the camera does a very good job of compensating for your bone-headed mistakes. You can use some bells and whistles to make particular types of photos look better, and I do recommend that you actually read the manual before using.2. Quite light weight. You will of course get better overall results with a tripod, but I have so far never used one, and am quite pleased with the quality of most of my photos. Stationary bird photos look great--but take numerous photos of birds in flight to increase your odds of capturing a great shot! I'm also quite pleased with the color in fall foliage/landscape photos.MINUS--1. If you are planning on taking lots of long-range photos, a camera with a more powerful zoom is definitely in order. Most shots I take are fairly close-in to mid-range, and this camera is great for that work.2. Battery life is somewhat shorter than I'd hoped--so carry extras in the field to avoid disappointment. In the camera's defense, I do take lots of photos each trip.3. A minor quibble--you were probably planning to buy a chip for added photo capacity anyway, and I highly recommend the Transcend 16 GB memory card! A plus--it is very easy to transfer photos from the card to your computer. I also bought the Case Logic DCB 304 Camera Case, and find it to be a good, economical choice.",

                "reviewText": "I have always been a snapshot artist, using all sorts of camera to get shots over the years. This camera was the result of a long search, for a unit with some weight to it for steadiness, a tripod fitting (essential) and a good zoom. After checking several major manufacturers, the S4200 seemed perfect for me. Now that I have had it for about 9 months or so, I could not be more pleased. The zoom is astonishing, and all the features I have learned so far are great. Like all digital technology, it has more gizmos than I will ever use, but it has a point-and-shoot capability that made it very easy to pick up and start using right away. Great field depth, sharp colors, HD quality, and setting, easy to controls, I think they made this just for me. I like how simple it is to navigate the settings. Beautiful camera, top-notch quality! I find that it takes better close ups (such as flowers, etc.)RECOMMENDED SD CARD TESTED FOR SPEED AND PICTURE QUALITY:SanDisk 16 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-016G-AFFPLINKTO SD : http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007KFXIDO/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Pros* Good image quality* Easy to use* Zoom range/performance* Fast / accurate auto-focus* Large clear LCDCons* Short battery LIFE (RECHARGEABLE BATTERY WORKS GREAT)Best Uses* Landscape/scenery* Travel* Family photos* Low light* Sports/action* Blink detector* Quick snap shots* Self timer (combine with facial recognition) example: if you set the timer to take a picture and you're not in front of the camera, the built in software will not detect you or any faces ,therefore no picture will be taken.* Yes, I would recommend this to a friend, Well even if you're not a friend",
