                "reviewText": "I never write reviews, but Can I just say I was so skeptical about buying these due to the low price and how small the camera was. We had a home security system we were ultimately paying about $90.00 a month for plus had to buy the cameras ect. totaling around $350.00 for all. I bought a pack of 4 of these for lower than $70.00 than bought another for lower than $20.00, it was the easiest set up ever and installing the app (Wansview cloud) was super easy as well. The picture is so super clear the sound is amazing and bonus I can talk to who ever is in my home wile I am away and they can clearly hear me as well. The camera is very small but captures the whole room I have put them each in. I can use my IPhone to see everything wile I am away. And bonus you do not need a subscription to do this. You can easily insert the SD card in to the camera if you chose to get them to record, but if you do not want to record there is no need for the SD card. I have installed 5 into 2 of my 3 kids rooms for baby monitoring 1 in the play room 1 in the kitchen and 1 in the Livingroom, all working beautifully. I will defiantly be buying 5 more of the outdoor Galayou home security cameras for outside of the home as well now that I no they work so well. The night vision has clear as day vision. I can not say enough this is a perfect security system/baby monitor and bonus what an excellent price!! These are simply amazing for the price and to ensure a feeling of safety. The only trouble I am having is I should be able to connect them to my Echo Show so I can use that as a screen to monitor as well but I can not seem to get them to connect to it, but I can always see the rooms on my phone through the app so not a huge deal to me. I do recommend these to anyone who 1) wants a baby monitor and you don't want to spend $200.00 or 2) just wants home security that you are not paying an arm and a leg for or pay for a monthly subscription. The cameras show the whole room, you can hear everyone in the room and talk to them as well, but bonus they are small enough to hide like nanny cams. Perfect devise. I will update when I order the outdoor security cameras and let you all no if they work just as well.",

                "reviewText": "These cameras were purchased in order to replace a couple of Akaso (pet) cameras that I purchased a few years ago. Some of them began to fail, so I searched for a well-reviewed replacement and stumbled across these Galayou Indoor Home Security cameras. The price is ridiculously low so there isn't really much to lose.I received them quickly and it was immediately apparent that they were better sized (i.e. inconspicuous) than my previous ones. They were also quite easy to set up, taking my previous micro SD cards without much hassle. They are quickly and simply formatted via the app. The picture quality is also very impressive.Time will tell if they are reliable long-term; nevertheless, these cameras are working very well at this time.I will likely order more soon. At this price, it's kind of silly not to!",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased these Wi-Fi cameras, and I must say, they exceeded my expectations in every aspect. The setup process was incredibly straightforward, and connecting them to Wi-Fi was a breeze. What impressed me the most is the outstanding video quality at 2k, providing a crystal-clear picture that captures every detail.The talk mode, complete with a microphone and speaker, adds a whole new dimension to these cameras. The ability to communicate in real-time and the inclusion of alert options significantly enhance the security features. It's reassuring to know that I can stay connected and respond promptly to any situation.Another notable feature is the option to insert a small SD card. This convenient capability allows for video recording and image storage directly on the device, providing a seamless and accessible way to manage captured footage.For in-home use and security, these cameras are a perfect choice. The built-in microphone allows for two-way communication, and the alarm feature adds an extra layer of protection. The price point was more than reasonable, and the fast shipping, coupled with excellent customer service, made the overall buying experience highly satisfactory.In conclusion, these cameras offer a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for home security. I highly recommend them for anyone looking for reliable performance, advanced features, and excellent customer support\u2014all at an affordable price.",
