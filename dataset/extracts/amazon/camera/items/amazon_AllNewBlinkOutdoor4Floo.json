Using the blink app I'm able to connect to camera in seconds. Plenty if light from the camera to get clear pictures and video at night. Not sure about battery life since I've only had it for a few weeks. I currently have multiple blink indoor and outdoor cameras and batteries typically last for 6 to 8 months depending on usage. No issues with wireless connectivity. And for me it's a must to have the Blink cloud storage for easy retrieval of video. Im very satisfied with my purchase so far.",
