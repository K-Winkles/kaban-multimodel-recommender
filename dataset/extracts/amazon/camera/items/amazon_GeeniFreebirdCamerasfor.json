                "reviewText": "Its one of the few rechargeable options out there with an SD card slot for storage. I prefer the local storage option for both privacy and cost - i.e. no subscription needed. The big selling point is you can mount this anywhere, without needing to run cables!Battery is on pace to last 2mos before needing a charge. (Note: battery life will vary greatly depending on the wifi signal strength where it's mounted, and how often you view the video streams)It's lacking some of the control features you find on other models, such as active zones for motion detection and 24-7 recording etc. however I've found the motion deception to be pretty good at detecting people and ignoring cars that drive by.Overall, pretty happy with this.",

                "reviewText": "I had Blink cameras for a couple of days and decided to return. I already had Geeni smart plugs to help control my bearded dragons\u2019 lights so once I discovered they also made cameras and I could just add them to my existing Geeni app\u2014I was excited to get them. The Geeni cameras have better video quality. You are also able to adjust the viewing angles better because the Geeni Freebird covers a bigger area and has the option of a regular mount and a strong magnetic mount. The magnetic mount has a circular connection which allows you to swivel the angle just right. Wish it came in all black so that it would be more discreet. They were super easy to mount and to connect to wifi/Geeni app. Once powered on, it gave an option so scan a QR to recognize the camera and connect it. I like that the batteries are rechargeable but I don\u2019t think I saw a way to get to them to replace them with regular batteries. Wanted that so that way I don\u2019t have to take the cameras down to recharge. I\u2019ve only had them for a few hours now so we will see how the battery life is.",

                "reviewText": "TL;DR: YGWYPF. These units are better than some, but not a solid solution for true security, and if you have to reach out to customer/tech support, you're likely in for a very long and frustrating experience. I think as far as Geeni / Merkury goes, I'll be sticking to smart light bulbs and outlets.So, I've adopted much of the Geeni / Merkury ecosphere. Generally speaking, they're dependable, easy to set up, and quality products at a reasonable price-point. Needing to replace my outdated and now-malfunctioning older exterior cameras, I was excited by the potential of this unit: fully wireless, battery-operated weatherproof HD security camera? Yes, please. Build-quality seemed fine. The unit is beefy, most likely due to the combo of a large battery and a strong magnet. Speaking of the magnet, I was *very* impressed by the ingenuity and strength of the magnetic mounting system: the unit is very stable when mounted this way (but obviously, this mount is not truly secure: someone could easily just grab and make off with the camera, so mounting this way would be more secure if mounted well out of reach to prevent this). It is nice that they also include a screw-on bayonet-style mount as well.The issue is with its connectivity, especially with regards to Amazon Alexa and the Echo Show. I purchased three (3) Echo Show units expressly in order to monitor security from various rooms in my home. While I have no problem monitoring my Geeni Sentinel 1080p indoor camera -via- all my Echo Show devices, as well as in the Geeni app, I have tried repeatedly (including hard resets and reconfigs) to get Amazon Alexa to \"see\" the Freebird at all, although it IS viewable in the Geeni app on both my phone and tablet. Contacting Geeni customer service (twice) is a frustration measured on a different scale, which wound up necessitating interfacing with the offshore \"developers\" in Who-Knows-Where-Istan. After supplying the relevant info to them, I haven't heard back from in over a week, and have received zero help since I asked for it, nor remedy.Outside of that issue, in the case of all Geeni cameras, one should be aware that as far as security goes, you're not going to be able to quickly \"see\" the view from this camera on a wireless display other than your phone through the Geeni app. On an Amazon Echo Show (on a very beefy mesh network, no less) the time it takes for the camera view to populate is between 6-10 seconds. So someone considering this as a true security camera solution should understand that you're not going to get a view of any camera on an Echo Show in the event of a time-sensitive situation (like, say, a trespasser).Pretty disappointed over-all...",

Battery lasted about 1 week on a full charge.Only records clips-camera only records when there is motion detected, and it's SHORT clips, so you are likely to miss a lot.In order for it to record motion, you have to have notifications turned on, and with them turned on, your phone is going to be pinging constantly if you have even low traffic. When my windchimes move, my phone goes off. I turned the notifications off not knowing that also meant it didn't record ANYTHING.Pulling up the app to view motion sometimes takes so long, the motion that triggered the camera has ended. App is SLOW and glitchy.Overall, camera was not worth the money. I would rather take the steps to install a power outlet and have a constant recording camera.",

The camera does not record constantly, unlike the indoor version, there is no setting to do this, it will only record when the motion sensor is triggered. This is a huge issue, especially considering the motion detection, at best has a massive delay. I have noticed this to be up to 2 seconds, meaning that it takes 2 seconds for the camera to start recording. I have had packages delivered, get the notification there was movement, and when the video is inspected I see the foot of the delivery person leaving through the gate. This is still better than the countless times it simply does not register the movement. I would estimate upwards of 80% of the time it does not register myself coming home and opening the door. Very unreliable and inconsistent, and I will be replacing mine with something else.",
