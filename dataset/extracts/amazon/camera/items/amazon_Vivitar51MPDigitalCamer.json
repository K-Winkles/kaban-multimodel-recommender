My son tried to make good use of it, but the photos are terrible quality and then when it got full it just deleted everything, so now he doesn't have any of the pics he took. No slot for a memory card, and we never figured out how to get the photos off the camera in the first place. It's basically a piece of flimsy plastic that happens to take pictures and eats through AAA batteries.",

The third is clearly not new, as there are sticky finger prints on the camera. However, this one has a newer looking menu system and provides one or two more controls than the others. I have not yet found a way to update the camera's firmware, but I doubt my kids will even know the difference.Image quality is tolerable. There's definitely the expected color noise in lower light (such as indoors) but it's better than I get with the camera on my phone.I haven't turned these over to my kids yet, so I can't speak to durability.I picked them up on sale, and I feel like they were a reasonable value for cost at that price.",

It doesn't take memory chips so there's no other option. I now have pictures on the camera that cannot be downloaded. Worst buy ever! I knew the camera didn't take the best pictures thanks to reviews and that was acceptable as I only needed to take a specific picture then give to my toddler to use. This isn't worth that! Don't buy!",
