Been a month and it hasn't been broken by any drops and battery life still maintains",

It was also flipped upside down in the box and dead, unlike the other one. Clearly already used. Not only that but BOTH cameras have a music app that is literally just a picture of music notes when you open it. Doesn\u2019t even play music I\u2019m not sure what the purpose is. Very cheap. My daughter is also very disappointed with the lagging and terrible audio on her videos. It\u2019s worse quality than cameras when I was a kid. & my daughter has had trouble deleting anything. It only works half the time. I only gave it 3 stars because they enjoyed them regardless. But I think you should spend your money on a nice camera, the cute little design and games are not worth the issues or low quality.",
