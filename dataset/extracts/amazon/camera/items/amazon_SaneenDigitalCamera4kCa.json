Secondly, I can't get the pics/videos off of of the camera because it is NOT recognized by any of my laptops or desktops when I plug it into the USB ports!You may as well take the $160 they're asking for this and flush it down the toilet or throw it out the window of your car as you drive down the road as the quality (both picture and workmanship) is THAT bad. I know of another person who ordered it and I found out that theirs broke a week after the return window closed!Its as simple as this you GET what you PAY for! I'm throwing this in the garbage since I cant return and buying a brand name thats reputable. Live and learn, I knew better but bought this anyway and now I'm paying for it literally by having to buy a new camera.",

I've been using it for my videos ever since and I don't have an issue uploading any footage to my laptop. The quality of the camera for the price of the camera is very fair. I like that the camera is touchscreen, it has also selfie mode. There is also different photo and video settings. The only thing that could be better is the volume of sound, but I just attached my own mic to the camera and it worked perfect! Overall it has given me no problems so I give it 5 stars.",

That's where it ended for me though.I've attached three photos. The top of each photo was taken by the camera. The bottom of each photo was taken with my Google Pixel 7 Pro.The 1st photo the camera couldn't focus on both flowers.The 2nd photo the camera did well with the statue but the words on the sign are blurry.The 3rd photo the berries were a deep orange. The camera was trying to add lighter color that wasn't there in real life and which the Google Pixel kept removed.The Pixel was easier to carry as I could put it in my pocket. The camera I had to put it in the supplied bag and carry it in my hand.Not sure what you are looking for in a camera but this one most likely isn't it.",
