                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had this camera for a few months now, and I\u2019ve been completely happy with it. It is user friendly, has a long battery life, and takes excellent quality photos and videos. I like how it alerts me, and can distinguish between a pet or a person- I\u2019m primarily monitoring my two feral cats. It has great features that perform well. It\u2019s got great night-vision viewing, and Colors are vibrant and clear. The monthly monitoring is very reasonable, and I\u2019ve gotten quick responses and thorough support whenever I\u2019ve had questions or an issue. Very good customer service. Now that I\u2019ve figured out about using it, I\u2019d like to get 1 or 2 more cameras. It seems like it will be easy to monitor them all. I highly recommend these Virtavo cameras as an affordably-priced, high quality, worthwhile investment.",

Instructions were easy, set up was a breeze, app is very user friendly. We don\u2019t have a power outlet in the attic, so hoping the battery lasts at least a week as described, but we just installed so I will update soon. The adhesive fell after one night, so should use screws if mounting off the ground. Two way audio works great, picture quality is amazing, WiFi connectivity is strong, even far from the router and tucked up in the attic. IR lights up pitch black like it\u2019s daytime. Good buy for me, I\u2019m going to buy more.",

The cloud storage subscription is only $2.99 after the 30 day free trial. The best part is the quality of that dang camera and the range!! It looks like daylight at night and the range of the view is off the charts! This one is definitely with the buy!",

                "reviewText": "Good: Battery life is decent they are rechargeable, and use a micro usb to charge indoors. Easy to settup , picture quality is pretty good in fair lighting, not so great in the dark. Sound is average. I have 4 of them, 2 on my front corners street side to watch driveway and road coming in as well as both angles to my door. One for backyard trailer and shed, and one inside .Bad: it seems no matter how i settup the parameters, it will still constantly go off if a car goes down road. I can set it far away from road and it will always pickup cars driving by and alert my phone/waste battery life by activating motion sense. It has two methods of memory for rewatching collected video. Sd card or a paid service . Youd obviously like to use a cheap sd csrd to capture footage, but for whatever reason does not save to it even after being formatted and settup per camera instructions. This is annoying because if somerhing does happen, i cannot go back currently to view the occurrence and basically am left with a $30 viewing lense through app. My dad also cannot save to his sd cards on his 4 cameras and constantly gets alerts to his phone for cars and neighborhood walkers who arent anywhere near threat/concern status. I may just pay for the service to save to cloud, but overall they are better than nothing and competitive priced. Its useful to watch your house while at work, or on vacation at various times to make sure all is good. They also have voice communication to the camera and from camera.",

There was either a long delay, or the battery didn't last very long and needed to be charged too frequently. These cameras are amazing. I am able to charge them once and leave them for a long time so far. The delay is less than a second, so I am able to see things near real-time. The night vision is incredible, in full color, and nice and bright. I love these cameras. The price is also VERY right! I highly recommend them!",

The sensor will trigger to the end of my driveway and even a bit into the road. We purchased to keep an eye on the front of the house and the driveway so great there. This was also very easy to install.The cons: There is a delay to pull up the feed. I have very good internet and have no issues getting feed right away from another camera brand in the backyard. I\u2019m not sure if anyone else is having an issue with this or not.Overall for the price, and quality of footage on the video, I\u2019m very happy with this camera, and will be purchasing others for the rest of my property as well.",

After using this device for about a week it all of a sudden stopped connecting to the App. Everytime I try to connect to the camera it says weak wifi signal move camera closer to router. If the fastest speed Spectrum offers doesn't work, nothing will. #UPDATE#2 The issue connecting to the app I was using was fine. My issue I was having was caused by a faulty battery.
