                "reviewText": "I have been interested in photography for over 50 years. When new innovations come along it usually catches my interest. Years ago the old Polaroid instant camera burst on the scene and and then eventually all but went away. Now there seems to be a resurgence of interest in instant print photography. I have recently become intrigued with these thermal printing instant print cameras for kids. I have tested and reviewed a number of them lately from different manufacturers. Let me make one thing clear from the start. These are not intended to take professional quality pictures. They are a kids toy and you shouldn't expect a lot from them. That being said, I am pretty amazed at the quality of images they can produce. I am referring to the digital files they record on the SD card, not the printed out pictures. Those are two different issues. When digital photography was first introduced, you would have pretty poor quality one megapixel images. Digital photography has come a long way since then and these little toy cameras are able to produce images on par with some of those next generations of digital cameras. These are certainly not as good as the camera on an iPhone or a Google pixel phone but they are absolutely acceptable for snapshots. The thermal printers put out a black and white image that is very recognizable and a decent picture that kids are delighted with. I was actually very impressed to find out how good they are. Not all of these kids cameras include all of the same features, in fact they can vary quite a bit. With that background, I am going to list some of the features that can be found on various instant print kids cameras and compare them with the features on this camera. Hopefully this will help you to make an informed decision as to whether this camera has the features that you want and if it is the right camera for you. If not, at least it may help you to know what you are looking for in another camera.1- Number of megapixels the camera has. Most of these cameras have choices in a range from 1-12 but a few I have seen have gone as high as 48 megapixels. In reality you're probably only going to want to set it to 5-8 megapixels as anything higher is not going to benefit the thermal printers capabilities or the snapshots you're taking. This camera has a choice of 1, 3, 5 or 8 megapixels.2- Video resolution. Most of these cameras have a choice between 720p (HD) and 1080p (FHD). That is the case with this camera.3- Paper roll diameter. In purchasing replacement rolls of paper for these cameras I have found that there seems to be two different sizes of rolls that you can get. The smaller of the two seems to be one inch and the larger is one and three sixteenths inches. All of these cameras are able to accommodate the smaller roll but some will not accommodate the larger roll. One nice thing about this camera is that it will accommodate either size. (An important note about loading the paper into any of these type of cameras- Be sure to follow the instructions and take care not to put it in backwards or it will not print.)4- External control buttons. The number of buttons that you have available to access the features makes quite a difference in ease of use. I have seen cameras with as few as five buttons, and as many as 10 buttons. Cameras with fewer buttons have to double up on functions in order to access all features. This can make it confusing- but doable once you get the hang of it. This camera has 5 buttons.5- Zoom lens. Some of these cameras have this feature and some don't. Obviously none of them will have a mechanical zoom, it will always be a digital zoom. This is one instance where more mega pixels could be beneficial. This camera has a 1-16x digital zoom.6- Flash. Most of these cameras don't have a true \"synced flash\u201d but instead have an LED \u201cfill light\u201d that pretty much serves the same purpose as a flash. That is the case with this camera.7- Print modes and print density. Most of these cameras tend to have a print mode choice of \u201cdot\u201d or \u201cGray\u201d. This is a matter of preference and you need to experiment to see which you like better. This camera offers both options. As far as print density goes, that is also something that you can adjust to suit your preference. It is what you adjust to make the print look neither overexposed or underexposed but just right. This camera has a good five step range of adjustment for print density. You should be aware that with any of these cameras, as the printer heats up, the print will get darker so you should let the camera rest a few minutes if that happens.8- Selfie mode. These cameras can get pretty creative when it comes to taking selfies. The best ones of course will be like a phone and have a front facing and rear facing camera. The worst ones will have a little tiny convex mirror about 1/4 inch in diameter on the front that you are supposed to look into and center your face. It is probably only a small step up from totally useless. There are a few other schemes that I have seen including one where the front facing lens swings up and becomes a rear facing lens. This camera unfortunately has the small mirror. If selfies are something that is important to you, maybe this isn't your best choice. If selfies don't matter that much this might be fine.9- Screen size. I have only seen two screen sizes on these types of cameras. They are either 2 inch or 2.4 inch. To me, it doesn't make that much difference between the two sizes but for some people it may make a difference. This camera has a 2.4 inch screen.10- SD card size. Most of these cameras have a 32 GB SD card and that is the case with this camera. That is a plenty big SD card for this purpose.11- Charging port. As with most of these cameras, this one does not come with a charger but the charging port is a standard USB-C and can be used with a phone charger. It does come with a standard USB-C charging cable so you can charge it from a computer or other USB port. Battery life on this camera seems to be pretty good and it charges fairly quickly.12- Timer for remote pictures. Most of these cameras including this one have the feature that allows you to set the camera on a table across the room, set the timer, and get into the picture with your friends. One thing you need to remember about this feature is that to access it, the printer needs to be turned off. If you want to print that picture later, you can go and choose it in the review picture mode and print it then. But if you have the printer turned on you will simply not be able to find the setting for the timer. This camera has the option to delay the shutter for 3 seconds, 5 seconds or 10 seconds. With the five second option you can also choose to have it take three exposures one after the other.13- \"Time/date\" stamp on pictures. This camera does have that feature but I cannot figure out how to turn it off if you don't want it. I may be missing something but I have looked fairly extensively with no success. Oddly, the printing of the time date stamp gets increasingly smaller as the setting for the megapixels goes up14- Loop Video (Cyclic Record) This feature allows the device to record video in certain durations (1/3/5/10 minutes, etc), and when memory is full, the oldest footage will be automatically deleted for new files to record. This seems like an odd feature for a kids camera and more like something that you would find on a dash Cam. Oddly, though, most of the instant print kids cameras that I have looked at have this feature. I guess if you wanted, you could use double stick tape to put it on the dashboard of your car and you would have a dash Cam! This camera gives you the options for loops of 1, 5 or 10 minutes.And now for a few of the fun features that the kids are going to like!15- Special effects. Other than outside cosmetic differences, this is probably the feature where these cameras differ the most. It seems that many of these cameras come with internal electronics that are made by one company and then customized for different camera manufacturers. The reason I think this, is because many of the sound effects and screens are similar between different brands. One of the items that seems to be customizable by the manufacturer of the individual camera is the special effects. Special effects are the overlays and filters included in the camera that you can scroll through and choose to include on your picture. I categorize the special effects on a particular camera into four groups. The first group I call \u201csmall accessories\u201d. These would be things such as a mustache, glasses, cat face, etc. When you choose one of these, it shows up on the screen and you line it up over the face of the person you are taking the picture of. Then you snap the picture and when it prints out the overlay will be included on the printed picture. The next category is \u201cframes\u201d. This is just what it sounds like- a cute frame that you can overlay around your subject. The third category is \"prism effects\". These are not overlays, but are splitting the picture into 2, 4, 8 or more parts that are put together into a kaleidoscope effect. The 4th category is simply colored filters. They will have no effect on the printed picture since it is black and white but it will affect the picture that is recorded to the SD card. Like I said, this is the feature that seems to vary the most between different cameras. The example of the mustache et cetera above is just too illustrate the category. As far as this camera goes it has items in all of the four categories, but the \u201c small accessories\u201d category only has a few items and they are not my favorite. There is a bear face that is difficult to line up on a person's face, a nose with some whiskers, a little Santa outline, and a giraffe face. It does have a lot of frames, many of which are cute.16- GAMES! This is a feature that puzzles me as to why it would be on a camera but the kids love it! They are fairly standard on most of these cameras and seem to be one of the features that the manufacturer can choose to customize on his version of the supplied software. The majority of the cameras that I have seen have included either four or five games. They include simple games like Tetris, snake, breakout, a box pushing game and sometimes a maze. This particular camera has four games. It does not include the maze game.Other things that I would note about this camera:it does have the ability to play MP3 music files if you want to do that. It comes with a manual that is readable and pretty understandable. One nice thing about it is that after you set it up to be able to take a picture and immediately print it, and you don't need to change any settings, then from an off state it only takes two button pushes to be ready to take a picture. This seems to be a good quality camera and if you like the features I have described I think you will be happy with it.I know this has been a long review, but if you are like me when I first stumbled on these cameras, and you don't know very much about them, hopefully this will help you sort out the myriad of features available.To help understand how I rate items:My philosophy is, that for a rating system to be effective, the highest rating and the lowest rating should be reserved for a relatively small percentage of the best and the worst products. If I give a product four stars, it is because I believe it is a very good product. To get five stars from me requires a product to go above and beyond and really impress me beyond my expectations. By the same token, a product has to be VERY, VERY bad to get only one star from me. One thing that I DON'T take into consideration with my ratings is price. I may make a general statement such as \u201cthis is a good value\u201d but it will not affect my star rating. The reason is that product prices change, even from day-to-day. Also what one person may consider a good price someone else might not. I feel it is more important to review the quality and features of a product and let the buyer decide whether the current price is worth it to them. Another thing that I don't take into consideration are issues with shipping. This is because the seller does not always have control over that. Following is each of the five categories of *stars* and how I assign them to a product:***** Five stars - The product exceeded my expectations. I really love it and would actively suggest it to friends and would certainly purchase it again if needed.**** Four stars - The product met my expectations. It does what it claims to do. I like it and would recommend it to someone if they asked about it. I would Most likely purchase it again if needed .*** Three stars - The product is average and for the most part does what it claims. There may be a few things I don't like about it. If I recommended it to someone, I would state my reservations. I may purchase it again if I could not find a better alternative.** Two stars - The product fell far short of my expectations. It may, in some respects, do what it claims to do but has far too many problems to overlook. I would never recommended it to someone nor would I ever purchase it again. There is a good possibility I would return it.* One star - The product is terrible. It has way too many cons and few if any pros. I would actively warn my friends away from it and would most likely return it if possible.",
