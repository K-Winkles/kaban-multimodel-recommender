                "reviewText": "To start, the installation was pleasantly easy with fairly simple instructions. The wi-fi pick-up on the device is pretty solid as well, so I haven't had it lose connection as of yet. The picture quality is pretty good for this price range, especially coupled with the night vision feature and the option to flash a white light while monitoring; I found that it can really clarify some things at night. This camera also includes a toggle-able burglary alarm sound that is fairly convincing albeit not as loud as it could be. The solar charging works extremely well if the panel is well-placed, and I have had zero issues with battery capacity, also having the option of easily dismounting the camera from the snap-on base make it easy to swap SD cards(which are optional) or unplug the device and charge in the house. The manual controls work great through the app and the range of motion and field of view are fantastic. All in all, this device is superb in functionality for the price range and no required subscription service, I would not mind getting more than a few of these for my home.",

You don't have to bring it inside to charge, or change the batteries like other models. I have the free version of the app it comes with and it works very well to see videos, save if wanted, and alert to activity. The video is clear all the way from my house to across the street. The sensor which alerts for people coming to the door seems to be well made, because I don't get false alarms, it is pretty accurate. The panning feature is something you can do from you phone from anywhere, and you can change where the camera is pointing and check out the area. Overall, I think this was a very good purchase. It serves as a deterrent and also gives me a feeling of safety whether I'm at home or out.",

                "reviewText": "This camera is very impressive for such a low price point. I was a little skeptical to buy this, but the reviews were great, so I decided I would make the purchase.I am really blown away by the picture quality. It is very clear even during a dark sky or a rainy day.The solar panel works great and the battery stays charged all the time. This was one of the reasons I made the purchase. My other two cameras need charging every few weeks and it is a hassle. This makes things very easy.Another feature I love is being able to adjust the camera to focus on particular things. I actually sit on the couch and follow my dog through the yard to make sure she goes the bathroom before going bed for the night. I also use it to watch our 3 year-old play in the backyard if I am busy on the phone or in the kitchen.Installation was simple and the app works great. The Wi-Fi is dependable and I have never had it disconnect.Overall, I am really pleased to find a camera that works well, has all these features, and is half the price of similar ones that I was considering.",

With the addition of this camera, I now have the added feature of moving the camera's point of view with the app. I\u2019m now able to monitor our surroundings with exceptional detail. What's more, the built-in infrared sensor seamlessly switches to night vision mode, providing vibrant full-color night vision. The camera's 360\u00b0 pan and tilt control further enhance its coverage, ensuring that no blind spots are left unchecked. I've included a screenshot recording of my app screen. Ignore the poor quality showing of the clip. My app show a great visual and you are even able to zoom in.Thanks to its advanced smart AI motion detection capabilities, this camera takes security to the next level. Its AI-powered analysis and recognition can distinguish between people, vehicles, pets, and even packages. The real-time notification feature promptly alerts you via the app whenever motion is detected, keeping you informed and in control of your property's safety.The two-way audio functionality allows for real-time communication.
