The direction sheet show a charge indicator by the charge port but it does not light up either if there is one.Directions say to install TF card but there were not any TF cards in the box with the cameras.Camera is unable to connect with phone, Android.Directions are confusing and unclear or the cameras just don't work.The video for setting up camera is horrible, shows inserting the Sim card and TF card, ok where do you get the TF card from and is it required to set up the camera?Is the signal indicator actually the charge indicator or is the charge indicator by the charge port? In any case nothing lights up on either camera when charging.",

I contacted the customer service through the system app which was really easy to use and the person who helped me, Joey, was exceptionally good and efficient not only at answering my queries but with rectifying the problem and sorting a replacement unit in under 3 days. Really happy across the board!",
