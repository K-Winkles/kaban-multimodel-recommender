                "reviewText": "I was surprised when my new phone had the lenses that stuck out so far away from the body. I got these protectors and they work well. As someone else said, they do break easily, but they protect the thing that's expensive, and that's what counts. I'd rather replace a cheap lens protector over and over than have to replace the actual lens on the phone!They are very easy to apply, much easier than any screen protector because it's obvious how they fit.2 tips with these:1. When removing and replacing, hold them over the trash can. The broken ones can splinter, and you don't want these fine pieces of glass on the floor.2. Take an extra with you on vacation. I wish I had! I broke mine on a trip and ended up just removing it. Luckily I didn't break the lens while I was gone, but I replaced the protector as soon as I got home!",

                "reviewText": "First thing: Lifetime warranty. The case these come in includes contact info for the distributor, who was very quick to provide me with a second set of these at no cost.Second: For the intended purpose of protecting the iPhone camera, these do a great job. I don't drop my phone often, but the few times I have, this has absorbed any impact that would go toward damaging the camera lenses. Does this mean that it's unbreakable? No. These can break. But they break in a manner that doesn't shatter or scratch the camera lenses at all, making the damaged cover very easy to remove gently, and replace.I think of these like a bumper on a car: it absorbs impact and distributes energy so the \"very important protected thing\" takes minimal damage. So these little guys have kept my iPhone safe for a little over a year now, and I'll continue to use them.",

The company immediately reached out after my order was placed to ensure the item I ordered was the correct item for my phone before shipping. When receiving the item I was able to install easily. Very few instructions, but I\u2019ve installed these type before. We have had them on our phones for a few weeks and they have not moved or cracked at all. Both adhered great and do not impact camera quality. Would definitely recommend this product!",
