                "reviewText": "So, I got this on Cyber Monday for really cheap. I just wanted a cam to stick on a large post out in the back yard to keep an eye on the dogs when we are away. For that, this camera is perfect, absolutely perfect.This is pretty low on extra features though. There is no OMNIV or RTSP support. I can somewhat understand as this is meant to be charged by a small solar panel and used on-demand. If this was hooked to my Blue Iris system constantly providing a stream, it would likely not be able to keep up with the small Solar panel. I did a port scan on the camera's IP and it found NOTHING.You can put a micro SD card in it and it will record on motion detection. That works surprisingly well and you can view the clips back very easily in the app. What you don't seem to be able to do is download the clip. I think you have to go out on a ladder and grab the card.The image quality is not too bad at all. The angle is very wide. PTZ movement is fast and smooth. Night vision is adequate. The \"floodlights\" that come on when it detects motion (you can turn that off) are not bad at all. They would certainly startle an intruder and provide enough light for a decent full color video feed to about 15-20 feet away.Installation is a breeze of course since it is completely wireless. WIFI reception is about the same as my Samsung s20 phone, so pretty good. WIFI setup is very easy. You select your SSID on the app, put the password in and it generates a QR code on your phone screen. Point it at the camera and it connects.One small point that most people won't care about is that it is indeed only 2.4 Ghz capable but does NOT play well with enterprise WIFI access points (Band steering). So if you run EAPs and a zone controller, you will want to create a 2.4 GHZ SSID just for these things. Odds are you already have though for a printer etc.",

                "reviewText": "My experience with the Recacam 4G LTE Cellular Security Camera was very positive. This wasn't my first time setting up a security camera, so after some research, I chose this particular model for its wireless, solar-powered capabilities. Installation was straightforward and hassle-free, requiring no complex wiring. The camera's built-in battery initially needs a 5V charge via the included USB cable, but afterwards, the solar panel efficiently sustains its power. I'm impressed by the array of features, including motion detection, push notifications, remote control, a spotlight, two-way audio, and a siren. The video quality is crisp and clear, enhanced by the night vision capability. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this camera's performance and would highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "This was my first experience purchasing and installing security/surveillance cameras for our home. After doing some online research, I finally decided to go with the Recacam wireless solar security cameras. Being wireless, it was a fairly quick and easy install with no labor intensive hardwiring. Although it's powered by a built in battery, after the initial 5V wall charge, the solar panel seems to maintain the power fairly well with normal use. The features of motion sensing, push notifications to my cellphone, remote adjustment, a spot light, two way audio communication, and a siren were good selling points for me. Plus, the video is surprisingly clear and crisp, and it has an added night vision feature. I decided to use a 128GB micro SD card option for video storage so I wouldn't have any recurring online storage fees. NOTE: The micro SD card does not come with the camera. Maximum card storage size that can be used is 128GB. CONS: The instructions were a bit confusing, with broken English and lack of clarity. Chinese? I was finally able to figure it all out, but it took some deciphering. Also, you can't delete individual videos from the SD card. If the card gets too full, you have to format it to clear up space, which deletes all the videos. So, backing up any important footage is a good idea. The camera does come with a USB charge cable, but no wall charger, so you'll need to use a 5 volt 2 amp cellphone charger. I guess they had to cut costs somewhere. Overall, I like the camera and believe it does a great job for what I needed. The Cloud Edge App is very basic, but seems to work ok. After purchasing the first camera, I bought 3 more. All in all, it was a good purchase and the cameras do the job!",

It is a little far from our house so we were happy it was still able to connect to the wifi. I had to play with it a little to get it to send the alerts I wanted but we finally have it lined out to where we want it. The clarity is great and I love the feature of being able to talk through it. We have ordered another one since we have a large amount of land. The ability of being able to pan around to other areas is another wonderful feature.",

From the features to the picture quality to the being 100% wireless this camera is absolutely amazing! It stays charged even with multiple overcast days in a row, the LTE signal is excellent and I live in a very rural area, connecting remotely isn't a problem whatsoever, it's motion detector is spot on, i HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA! Buyers take note the LTE 4G service (just like any lte 4g service is NOT FREE) but it's very cheap and well worth the money!",
