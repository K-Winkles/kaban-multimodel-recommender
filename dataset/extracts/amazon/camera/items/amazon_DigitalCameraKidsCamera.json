The 1080P 36MP quality is impressive, making her school projects stand out. The ease of use is perfect for a beginner photographer like her. She's been able to navigate its features intuitively, which has boosted her confidence in her photography skills. The time stamp feature is a neat addition, helping her track the progress of her projects. What's really made a difference is the 16X zoom capability. She's been able to capture detailed shots from a distance, which was a challenge with her previous camera. The two batteries are a bonus, ensuring she never misses a moment due to a dead battery. This camera has been more than just a school tool for her; it's become a gateway to exploring her passion for photography. It's heartwarming to see her eyes light up as she shares her latest shots. This camera has undoubtedly enhanced her photographic journey and brought her immense joy.",

He is no longer satisfied with us taking pictures of him, he always wants to take pictures of the things he likes by himself. I bought this camera as a Christmas gift for him. Although this camera does not have high functional configurations, its 36MP high-definition photos and 1080P videos can fully meet your daily shooting needs. And the 16X digital zoom can bring the distance closer and take clearer photos. More importantly, its anti-shake function can help children take stable and clear photos when their arm strength is insufficient. It is the size of a playing card, very lightweight, and the bright color is more suitable for children. I believe it is definitely a perfect gift for children.",
