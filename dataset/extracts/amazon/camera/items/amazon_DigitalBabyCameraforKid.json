There's lots of settings to try, it looks like a standard point and shoot (we like the asthetic of the \"lens\" on the front). The girls have a blasting using the smile sensing mode.However, if you buy this, make sure to get a different SD card. I bought two cameras and BOTH of the SD cards just completely stopped working on the second day both at the same time. Completely fried. No computer or any other device will detect it when plugged in. Get some different SD cards to use, and then you'll have a good time with the camera.",
