                "reviewText": "This camera was a replacement for my 2 year old yi outdoor wifi plug in camera which stopped working completely after a software update.I unpacked the camera, put it in the sun for 15 minutes while connected to the solar panel. The power/reset/sd card are all under a removable rubber plug on the bottom of the camera. Powered it up. Followed the instructions and installed the app. There you are prompted for your wifi info. I had no issues.Easy mounting. Toss all the included screws and anchors in the trash. They will cause you needless frustration. I used 2 drywall screws to fasten the camera bracket to the bottom of a rafter tail under my eaves on the corner of the house facing south. Slide the camera on the rail and it clicks in place. 3 more drywall screws to fasten the detachable solar base to the fascia on the west side of my house around the corner. Then hand screw on the solar panel and adjust. Hand tighten nut. Done. Cord from panel to camera is plenty long. Maybe 6-8 feet. I used about a foot. Ziptied and tucked the rest. Everything seemed sturdy enough for high winds. There are a lot of features on this camera. Install the app on your phone. It operates them well. It displays wifi strength percentage and battery power percentage realtime. My camera gets about 75-80% approximately 50 feet away from the router thru the garage on an Xfinity router. More than I expected. Battery life seems more than adequate with the included solar panel. But we've had full sun so I'll watch that. The camera has numerous features. It has an optional siren. With a warning on the app stating it may annoy your neighbors. I don't use that. And haven't heard it. It has 2 regular lights which will illuminate a small area if you choose to use that option. Turn on/off with the light button on app. There is night vision B/W and night vision color which uses different lights. I use b/w. The picture quality is fine. I don't need night colors. Overall quality of picture is really good. On the app, you just drag your finger on the screen to rotate the camera. 360 degrees around. Probably 90 degrees vertical from horizon and going straight down. There is a paid AI function which will recognize packages and animals and people and differentiate. I use an SD card for storage. I formatted it on PC using slow format fat 32. Installed in camera. Pressed alerts, and camera prompted to reformat SD card. Took 2 times but then it started functioning. You can set alert zones and all kinds of notifications for everything. The first camera I ordered would not power on. I returned it and the second on powered right up and worked fine. There is an included window security camera sticker. I'll be happy if I can get at least 2 years out of this camera. I love the idea that it's soler and doesn't add on to the power bill. I like the Fullscreen option on the phone/ipad. Also to add a second phone/iPad to view the camera, you have to add a 'family member' to your 'family' it's kind of convoluted but I got it to work reliably. It takes a while to set it up and dial it in, but it's worth it. I'd recommend the purchase. I will update as necessary*UPDATEIt appears the plastic cover over the camera lens has turned cloudy around the outside. The picture is blurred. I've cleaned the lens several times with a microfiber cloth and even tried light Windex on the cloth. Nothing is changing. Used to be perfectly clear. Haven't had the camera very long. Hopefully it will not continue to cloud to the point of unusability. Will keep you posted.2nd UPDATE 1-7-23Lens has cleared up. Don't know how or why but the picture quality is back to normal.",

                "reviewText": "I held off buying a security camera for a long time, since I have a few self-imposed restrictions. One, I don't mount anything on my exterior walls...they are stucco, and I think it weakens it to drill holes in it. Two, I don't want to hard wire anything or have to keep recharging it. Well, this camera solved both problems. I live where it snows, so as shown in the photos, I mounted the solar panel so it's almost vertical, and not at the recommended tilt angle. I also don't want snow building up on the mounting, so only the panel is exposed. The rest of the mount is attached to the soffit. No snow builds up on the panel. Same thing with the camera. I couldn't mount it where I wanted on the exterior of my trim due to the rain gutter, and I didn't want snow to build up on it, so I figured out how to mount it under the overhang. It works great there, and the camera is well protected.Pros - Very simple to install...straightforward instructions, even includes drilling templates if you need them. Setting up the app couldn't have been easier, took me about 5 minutes. Excellent picture quality, includes a zoom feature which I didn't know it had. The pan/tilt feature is really nice...I can look at my front porch then pan around and clearly see my fence/gate which is 200 feet away.Cons - Not really a con, but if you don't want (or can't) mount it flat on a wall, you'll have to fabricate a mount of some sort, as I did. I say it's not really a con because they can't be expected to anticipate every possible mounting scenario, and they do provide screws and screw anchors for standard mounting. I found nothing I would consider a con in regard to the use of the camera and the app.Customer Service - Excellent. I was concerned that my solar panel didn't seem to be charging the camera, so I emailed Anran. They got back to me in a couple of hours, and had suggestions to help me. I described what I did to set it up and they were very patient with my multiple emails. Problem solved and everything works fine now. And it wasn't a defect issue, just a minor adjustment with the cable.I now have two of these. Couldn't be happier, and I'll probably buy some more for gifts to neighbors and other friends.",
