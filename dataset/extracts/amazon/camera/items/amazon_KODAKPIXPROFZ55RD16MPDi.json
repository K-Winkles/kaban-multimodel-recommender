                "reviewText": "Bought this camera for a simple camera to use while traveling when I didn't want to take my huge Panasonic camera but still wanted a camera that wasn't on my phone, for safety purposes and also the anxiety of possibly losing or dropping my phone (either off high places, overboard, etc.). Many people say that it isn't worth it, and with the development of quality in phone cameras, why even bother buying a digital one that provides less quality photos than that of your phone, that almost everyone has and carries with them at all times? I personally like having a compact, portable camera that is less of an investment than an expensive smart phone in the case it gets stolen, dropped, damaged, etc. This in itself is an appeal for me to purchase a digital camera to use instead of my iPhone. It was a great alternative to my phone, allowing me to keep my phone tucked away in a pocket or a bag, while still being able to take photographs while on my trips. I really liked the red color offered, as I try to buy everything red. The camera itself is compact and portable, it was super easy to conceal and travel with, adding little weight to my travel bags. The camera is very easy to use, allowing different shooting settings, zoom, and even video recordings. The battery lasts quite a while too, but I bought secondary batteries just in case. I also really appreciate the fact the camera utilizes a rechargeable battery, so you can charge it on trips when you have a break and you don't have to be constantly carrying a set of AAs. The picture quality itself is high, in my personal opinion, really good for the price that you're paying and the compactness of the camera. The video quality could be better, but is decent for the size and price of the camera. If you're zooming in a lot, the video quality is obviously compensated, and the audio quality in videos isn't the best, but. You get what you pay for, and in this case, you actually get better. It's well worth the money, providing video-recording abilities and high quality photographs. I highly recommend this camera for anybody looking for a camera for the same purposes as I. It's well worth the money and has exceeded my expectations in performance. It would also be a great starter camera for someone looking for a simple point-and-shoot camera, or for adolescents looking to get into the camera/photography community. Obviously if you're a professional photographer, I wouldn't recommend this camera, but I doubt anybody professional is looking to take high-quality, professional photographs with a simple point-and-shoot camera. For the price, quality, and performance, this camera is well worth the money, and I highly recommend it!(:",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great camera for international travel!",
                "reviewText": "I purchased the Kodak pixPro FZ55 for several reasons: a) I needed a smaller camera that took up less space in my luggage and/or travel backpack; b) used Li-ion rechargeable batteries that could be charged either in the camera or in a small charger; c) took good photos, day or night, of people, buildings, and scenery; d) took good video using 32 or 64 GB SD cards; and e) cost less than $150.00 (for a point and shoot camera!). I received my camera in three working days, opened the box, read the instruction manual, charged the battery (comes partially charged), and put the camera through its paces for a week.Likes and Dislikes: Look at the comparison photo of my \"normal-sized\" DSLR with carrying strap and regular lens, and the Kodak next to it. Camera fits in my hand. When I travel internationally, usually eight to ten days, I do not use checked luggage; I use only a backpack carry-on that actually fits in the overhead without being offensive to fellow passengers. To do that, the choice in cameras is obvious. Why not just use my cell phone? Because of the increasing number of folks who have lost 'em, dropped 'em, or had 'em stolen. Camera setup using on-screen prompts easy to understand and follow, menu choices easy to ascertain and follow too. Camera takes good photos outdoors as seen in several of the other photos. Zoom (telephoto) capability is average, as seen by the two photos with the white building and vehicles in the distance. Camera doesn't compensate well when too much light is coming in as seen in one photo with bright vegetation and tree shadows, but that can be adjusted with better technique and composition. Macro photos tend to be \"flat\", as seen in one photo, but I expected that without f-stop adjustments or using a tripod. Again, use of better technique would probably help. Also need to think about space and weight in the travel bag.Zoom is smooth with normal low buzzing sound found in higher-priced point and shoot cameras. LCD screen is small, but I expected that because of the overall smallness of the camera. For me, I can still see the screen image fine. Indoor photos with flash are passable, but one must be close to subject due to reduced flash output. Flash turns \"on\" and \"off\" easily. Timer works well, 2s &10s delay with audible beep when ready to shoot. Use caution and a careful touch when opening the camera to insert or retrieve SD card and/or battery located in same slot, and check that camera is OFF when trying to access the port, located on the bottom corner.",

                "reviewText": "I have to say that overall this little camera is good. There is a definite lag between pressing the button to take a photo and hearing the click which means it has happened. Be sure you allow yourself a little extra time before moving the camera. The photos are pretty good/sharp/clear. I have not printed any. I would have preferred a written book of instructions as opposed to a downloaded version. I'm not sure that this camera is any better than the cheaper \"kid\" cameras. I went with it because of the brand name. It is good for nonprofessional results, a starter camera, or to use until you decide if you want a better camera or a phone with an amazing camera built in. I have used it to take oddball photos of things that most people would not notice and it has worked ok for those. Again, the lag in pressing the button and taking the picture is a bit annoying. Make sure when you order any accessories that they are for this model.",

The zoom feature does not seem to work properly and produce clear photos.

I think that I got better pictures with an iPhone 6.Overall, if you want decent photos, don't buy this - the picture quality is atrocious.",
