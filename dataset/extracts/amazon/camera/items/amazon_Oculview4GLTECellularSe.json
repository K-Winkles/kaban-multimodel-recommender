                "reviewText": "I literally had this up and running in just a few minutes. You just screw it into a light socket, and follow the easy instructions in the mobile app. It was a snap!One little tip: the only thing you really need to be aware of is the length of the bulb. If you are using a covered fixture, be sure to check the length. If the cover is open at the bottom, you shouldn't have any problem, unless the bottom of the cover obscures the camera lens (mine did not). However - even in that case, no problem - because for just a few dollars, you can buy a simple light socket extender pretty much anywhere. That just screws in first, and your device will then screw into that. Easy.Now, as for the device itself: I love it! You can pan left and right or tilt up and down. (You pinch the screen to zoom.) This allows you virtually full coverage of wherever it is installed.This also has motion detection and can alert you (if you choose).It's entirely optional, but in the app, you can subscribe through your phone's regular app store to get video storage. It's pretty inexpensive, but again, not required. You can buy this and never pay anything more and still get full use of it.As one or two have pointed out, it is possible for someone to unscrew this. Highly unlikely! Most people won't notice it, especially at night, and they would also realize that they have ALREADY been seen by the camera and possibly recorded (if you opt for that). So that should be of minimal concern, really.In short, this is a great device that works flawlessly, is super easy to use, and will give you extra peace of mind. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "Setup is easy. Screw camera into a light socket, download the app, make an account, connect it to the wifi network (2.4G only), and you are in business.Out of the box, this feels solid and well made. There are instructions that guide the process for setting it up. The CloudEdge app is robust and intuitive to navigate settings and features. This is useable for indoor or outdoor use. I tried finding operating condition specifications on the box, instructions, and online (manufacturer and seller websites aren't clearly established) so I queried the seller through the Amazon messaging and they replied quickly stating that it can be used in -20C to -50C (-4F to 122F).There are 2 ways to save videos - an online storage solution through the app, and through a micro SD card (sadly not included). The online storage has options for 3-day or 7-day overwrite looping for either alarm-triggered video or full-time video on monthly, quarterly, or annual subscriptions. As cheap as micro SD cards are, adding one to the package would easily get people started, but perhaps they think that would cut into subscriptions.Quality of video and sound are good. In the app, you can choose video quality, video orientation (for upright- or downward-facing light sockets), manually move the camera up/down and back/forth, sound an alarm, speak through the camera, set trigger parameters, and many other options. Response in the app was crisp and moving through it made sense. Multiple devices can be added and controlled through the app for coverage around the home or even at multiple homes.Using this at the front door would be nice, but the only deterrent to this would be the ease with which someone could simply take the camera by unscrewing it. Perhaps placing a clear glass dome around it will be possible with a little homework.Overall, I am impressed with this brand with which I am unfamiliar. Despite a lacking online presence and scant literature information that comes in the box, if you can't figure something out, it seems like the retailer is quick to provide help through the Amazon messaging. I will keep playing with this and if anything interesting pops up, I will update this review.",

                "reviewText": "This security camera from Oculview provides good image quality in a very simple to use app. It takes just a few minutes to install the app, create an account and be up and running. The camera is fully controllable from the app, you can set the motion detection, and record manually, as well as take snapshots and activate the intercom. I like that it simply screws into a regular light socket/fixture, requiring no additional wiring or plugs to deal with. The option to add a micro SD card is also a nice feature.The motion detection is quite effective, providing a snapshot whenever it is triggered. I have tested this in my home and intend to install it in my barn/workshop near the door for extra peace of mind. I get a lot of deliveries and would like to know when someone is in my driveway or approaching my property.Overall I am very pleased with the performance of this security camera, and I look forward to further testing and seeing just how effective the night vision is. I think it is a reasonable value for the price, and the peace of mind.",
