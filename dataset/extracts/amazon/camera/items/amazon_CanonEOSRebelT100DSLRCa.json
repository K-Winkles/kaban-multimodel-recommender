I love the additional features of WiFi connection and video. I have used it a couple of times. First time was a holiday light exhibit. The pics turned out great. Second time was for a Christmas church event. I have to say it takes great pictures. Great investment and price for a beginner or in my case a replacement camera.",

While it's an older model, it's capable of taking much better photos than you can with your smart phone. The camera can also be used as a very high quality webcam or video cam. The only issue I have with this for creators is that there is no way to attach a microphone. If you want better quality sound for your videos, you'll need to record on your phone or a separate recording device. Other than that, I like this camera a lot. Put it in Auto mode and learn how to shoot photos, then dabble with customizing the images using the numerous settings. Great value.",

Reviews of this camera can be brutal, mostly from two groups: high-end owners upset it doesn't perform like their $2200 Nikon, and brand new folks who haven't figured it out.This camera is not topicalized, but I took the accompanying photos in very low temps. I am quite happy with it, especially at $329. Most people will find the 3x zoom to be adequate.Pro: It's automatic if you want that, but has adjustments for more precisionCons: The auto-focus can be finicky",
