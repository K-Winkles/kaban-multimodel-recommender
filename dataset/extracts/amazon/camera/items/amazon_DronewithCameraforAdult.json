                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. There's no reason to buy an expensive drone if you're not sure if you or family members won't enjoy flying one. This is an affordable starter drone. I wouldn't recommend it for professional use, but those cost hundreds of dollars.The drone folds up nicely and fits neatly in the box. It's very portable. The kit comes with batteries for the remote, which is a nice touch. The remote has a guide that can be used for first time drone flyers. Remote has a lever that flips out to place your phone. Phone is then connected to an app, from which photos and videos are taken from the drone and sent to your phone.The battery lasts a good amount of time. I noticed it starts beeping around 20 minutes when it's time to change. Kit comes with 2 batteries, which charge with USB-C (included).The camera is good enough to enjoy taking photos and videos of your neighborhood and houses from up above, for personal use. I didn't try the portrait settings with finger waives, but my wife is a photographer, so we have plenty of portraits of our family.Because it's lightweight I don't recommend flying it on a windy day. I flew it on a somewhat windy day and it took quite a bit of effort and time to fly it back to the landing site against the wind. Also it does not have a GPS assist to return it to its original landing site, but it does have take off and landing features. So it will lift up and drop to land with the push of a button.I also recommend first time users to take it to a park with a lot of space. You'll want to get used to flying it with a lot of space. It can move pretty quickly. Video attached of it zooming by at low altitude after take off.",

The app to record and take photos is also very user friendly and explains everything there is to know about the drone. I\u2019ve flown this model quite a few times now and can say it has a good battery life getting around 45 minutes a charge, since it comes with 2 batteries you\u2019ll have around an hour and a half of flight time total. The batteries also charge very quickly getting you back in the sky and ready to fly in a little under 30 minutes each. Over all I was very surprised by the quality of the drone and camera. It would make a great gift to any one wanting to learn or someone just wanting a fun compact easy to use drone!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Let me begin by saying that this is my first experience with one of these drones. I purchased it because I had some roof damage a year ago and I am still dealing with an insurance claim. I have a tarp on my second story roof that has shifted out of place a couple of times already and I wanted a quick way to check it regularly without having to pull out a heavy 30-foot ladder and climb up there every time (one time was scary enough). I figured one of these simple drones would get the job done safely and on a budget. I was right, sort of.The controller seems very intimidating when you hold it in your hands because of the number of buttons and features, but it comes with a great quick reference card that sits right on top of the controls. It is very helpful and you can operate the drone while the card is in place. Every remote-controlled toy should come with something like this. In order to use the drone to its fullest capabilities, you need to attach a cell phone (cell service is not required) and download their app. I used an old Android phone that is not currently connected and only works on Wi-Fi. You can then connect the phone to the drone via its own Wi-Fi network.The app is fairly clear, but there are several features that have descriptions in Chinese even though most features are in English. I found no way to change those Chinese ones to English and it is my only complaint about the product and the reason why I knocked off one star on the Remote Control rating. That should be a simple software update so if that ever happens, I will update that portion to 5 stars. It does not affect functionality in any way as the descriptions appear to be for music that you can add to video captured by the drone. At least, I assume that is what the feature is for. One other feature was in Chinese and I could not figure out what it did. Neither feature is described in the instructions either.The instructions are otherwise pretty good and only have a few grammatical/translation errors, but you can still understand the explanations. They describe the features, but by far the best instructions are the quick reference card I mentioned above.As for the drone itself, it is compact, foldable, lightweight and comes in a great carry case. The arms fold out easily and it comes with guards that snap in at the end of each arm to protect the propeller blades. While the package includes a couple of extra propeller blades, I do not recommend operating it without those guards. Those are a must and I will explain why.As I said, the drone is lightweight. That\u2019s great for carrying it around but it makes it very difficult to control if there is even the slightest breeze. Thankfully, the joystick controls are very responsive and all of the buttons work well.I began by operating the drone in my living room and the air conditioner suddenly kicked on. The air from a nearby vent caused the drone to drift away and bump into a wall. Since the bumpers were attached, it gently bounced off the wall and continued hovering. That made me very cautious when I took it outside. There was a slight breeze on both days I that took it out. My yard has a cement wall on one side and a wooden fence on another, so I began by operating it near the corner. The app connected to the drone quickly, it started up perfectly and the camera quality is great when viewed on the phone.I tried flying up toward the roof and as soon as it got above the fence line it immediately fell victim to the wind. It was a struggle to navigate my yard which has tree branches, string lights and a pergola. I recommend flying it only in clear areas and when there is little to no breeze, but I suppose that is common sense. When operating it in the front yard I was able to go higher, but still struggled with directional controls. That is probably more attributed to my lack of experience with drone flight. I discovered \u201cHeadless Mode\u201d which helped a bit. That shifts reference point of the controls to the drone\u2019s position relevant to the operator than the direction in which the drone is facing. I read that this is a feature for beginners and I recommend staring with that turned on.The drone, like many entry-level drones, is not GPS enabled and does not have an automatic \u201creturn home\u201d feature if it goes out of range or begins to run low on batteries. You need to be very aware of its distance from you and its battery life. I had about 15 minutes of flight time on a fully charged battery, which I have heard is fairly standard.I do not feel comfortable doing a thorough survey of my roof yet since some that will involve flying higher and perhaps losing sight of the drone as I circle my roof. I found myself focusing more on the position and distance of the drone that what was being displayed from the camera. That part is not a flaw of the product. I just need to practice a bit more and the weather has been too windy recently to allow that.I recommend this drone for beginners and the price point is great for this set of features, but if you are an advanced user with more complex or commercial applications in mind, this drone may not have the features and range that you need. For what it is and claims to be, it is worth the 5 stars and I have no regrets purchasing it.",
