                "reviewText": "Bought this thinking it would work with mipc app. Couldn't get it to connect to that app. Downloaded the decko app. Install was straight forward and setup was very straight forward. The app is smoth and very functional. Loaded with features that make it a must buy. There is an on screen joystick for you to move the camera as you see fit, the human detection is spot on and is able to differentiate between animals and humans.The led light is bright enough to seen things clearly, the night vision is very clear. There's an audible alarm when motion is triggered, it can be turned off. Persons about 10 to 15 feet away can clearly hear and understand you as you can talk to them through the camera. The wifi connection is strong given the strength of your network signals. It will alert you if a event happens and tell you the kind of alert, i.e. passing (animals) or human detection. Make sure you purchase a MicroSD card large enough to handle the videos needed. It will loop record for full videos all day and all night or you can set it to only record if the motion sensor sees something. You can install the app on multiple devices (phone, tablet) so you can see what ever is happening even when your not physically there.Most all settings can be done thru the simple user screen, you can set it to cruise (look around) and how and when to do that.Will be buying more soon.Great product.",

Infrared, and flood light, with talk/listen, and prerecorded verbal warnings. Event or 24 hour recording, great push time for notifications in the app if an event occurs! Keep what videos may pertain to your needs or delete the event under Events feature. Great customer service as I have had these cameras since November, during a recent COLD snap, my one unit lost horizontal movement. An email to support and and explanation of the problem, and a replacement was sent, thank you Sophia! I would buy these again!",

                "reviewText": "DEKCO 2K WiFi Surveillance Security CameraMost recent update: DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL. I have ordered many and they all have problems. However, the cameras, when working properly, are great. But you can't get them anymore. So... look on Amazon for the \"5MP\" version which is just barely different but not really. It's nearly the same and it works perfectly. I just ordered 4 more for my mother's house and they all work flawlessly, albeit they all struggle with connecting to Apple phones. The rest of this review was written BEFORE I bought the 5MP versions so keep that in mind. The following review is for the version you're seeing here on this page.Update: So the other cameras I bought that I hadn't installed yet all failed. All of them got stuck at the initial setup stage with just a blinking green light (which is not defined in the user manual). So I had to send all the cameras back except the one I was already using which still works. I also looked in the Questions and Answers area on Amazon on this product and I found out that I'm not the only one going through this. So apparently this is version 2 of their product which is a complete bust. Version 1 worked great. You can't buy version 1 anymore. So... I don't recommend you buy this product anymore. I've taken it down from a 4 star to a 1 star.Here is my original review:This review is for the DEKCO 2K WiFi Surveillance Security CameraSo let me just start by listing off all the things wrong with it. I'll get that out of the way first.1. The screws they give you are really cheap. It's easy to break them. Get better screws and you won't have to drill your holes first.2. The motor mechanism that turns left/right/up/down will burn out eventually. Try not to use it too much. It's not a video game. If it moves too much because it's tracking motion, it will eventually run out. And when looking down, it won't be able to look back up unless you go out there and turn it up yourself.3. The setup process can be a bit finicky sometimes. I've had to go through the exact same setup process four times until it finally took.4. The quality and volume of the microphone and speaker leaves a lot to be desired.5. The cloud option isn't very useful.6. There is no zoom feature. But you can \"pinch\" to zoom on your phone but that only lets you zoom in on the image on your phone. The camera, itself, doesn't actually zoom.7. Even with a porch light, when pitch black outside, the night vision only works to about 10-15 feet at best.I want to say that I really do like this camera. I like it so much that I went from purchasing 1 to purchasing 4 total (so far). I really wish it offered \"starlight\" technology instead of relying on the red lights because red lights attract bugs and thus sets off the motion detection all the time.I HIGHLY recommend getting a 2 or 3 year protection plan. After all, this device is made in China.I recently installed another one of these and it will be a little exposed to the weather. So we'll see how that goes. (edit: has gone very well)",

                "reviewText": "These cameras are phenomenal, I\u2019m not joking I can't think of anything I've ever bought that was as good value. I bought one to replace one of the three previous Yeroyi cameras I had because it was just so unreliable, it was slow to get in the app and load the live feed and it would only rarely be possible to view recordings but this Decko camera was a revelation. Most importantly it has flawless reliability, I think it had better signal to the router thanks to it having two antennas, the app and live feed loads up instantly and it records continuously to the SD card seamlessly (or you can choose to only record when it detects motion) and I can immediately view the playback where on my old cameras, IF I could view playback I could only do it after about 5 minutes had passed. The app itself is very well made and easy to use with plenty of options and settings, the image quality is better and then there\u2019s the features such as having full 360 degrees control of where the camera is looking via the app, it has night vision lights and led lights which you can set to turn on when motion is detected to get a full colour image at night. The motion tracking works really well but I have it turned off most of the time because the camera catches just about everything I need to see without needing to be moved and because these are cheap I can\u2019t imagine the motors will last forever. The motion alert system works perfectly for our front door, it doesn\u2019t send me notifications when a car goes past or a person walks on the pavement but it does send a a notification immediately when someone walks on my drive which is exactly what you want.The only unknown about them is how long will they be reliable for so I will update this review periodically good or bad. I\u2019ve had them running for a few days now and they have all worked without fault, my only criticisms I have so far are that the SD is easily accessible and can be quite easy to see where it is stored which for a security device is not ideal if you have it low down within reach but I suppose if anyone was going to try and tamper with an accessible security camera they would more likely just try to block the camera view. The only other thing is with the camera we have covering the back garden was constantly turning the LED lights on and off at night, this is due to a function which turns on the LED lights when it detects a person but my guess is it was identifying our folded up garden parasol as a person because it is a similar size and shape as a person and was moving slightly in the wind, thankfully I was able to just turn that function off in the settings.I just can\u2019t believe how good these are for the money, I was so impressed it I bought 3 more to replace my other cameras and add one more so every inch of the outside of my house is covered, I got them for the ridiculously cheap price of \u00a326 each but I'd honestly I\u2019d have been happy with them at 2 or 3 times the price I paid.",
