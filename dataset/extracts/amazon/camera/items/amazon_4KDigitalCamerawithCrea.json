                "reviewText": "Holy Cow. This is my dream camera, and I'm wondering where it's been all my life. I didn't have high hopes for this, as I'd tried several budget cameras, and they were always cheezy, and still missing features I really need. This one had those features (microphone input, flipscreen, ability to accept lens filters, shoot at 60fps, etc).A few years ago, I spent 6 times as much as this camera costs, for a big name mirrorless camera, that boasted itself as being the most user friendly camera on the market. It wasn't. Not for me. Ended up getting rid of it. This camera destroys it, at 15 or 20% of the pricetag.The build quality surprised me. Was expecting a cheezy thin plastic body that would break if you yelled at it. Nope. It's built at LEAST as tough as my $600 camera, if not tougher (and I think it is).Love the flipscreen being on top. It's easier and better to look up slightly to see yourself, than to look off to the side, where most flipscreens tend to be located on camera and camcorders.And the display! So clear. I recommend using a variable ND filter. It accepts 52mm filters.Awesome quality picture and video. And so simple to use.The only minor gripe I have, is that it comes with a cheezy strap. But there are some pretty expensive cameras out there that come with cheezy ones, too. Oh, and the lack of any cold or hot shoe mounts. Which can be easily remedied with other accessories. That's it. That's the only thing it lacks in.I recommend this to any beginner to vlogging, videography, or cinematography, especially if you're on a tight budget. This has to be the biggest bang for buck deal in a camera that I've ever seen. Unless you're a seasoned photographer/videographer who has 500 or a thousand bucks to spend on a camera, this is The One. No Joke.",

It has bright and crisp looking picture quality. It comes with all the accessories needed to start vlogging. Battery life is pretty good with a couple hours of use and it has 2 batteries. Its not oversized and fits in small bags. Lightweight and pretty easy to operate.",

                "reviewText": "This kit is not worth the money; there are better ones at this price. The lack of a memory card is frustrating in an otherwise fully stocked kit, this would be an issue if you buy this as a gift for a kid and they expect to use it out of the box.I didn't even know there were still cameras produced today that lack an autofocus! It's very easy to have it be blurry because you moved out of focus, and this camera is meant to allow you to take footage of yourself. Missing the shot can easily result in a lot of wasted time. I also went through a fully charged battery really quickly. There are a lot of improvements to the display that could help with battery life.The best part about this kit was the lens and tripod. The tripod acts as a power bank which is a clever function that I wish was found on more tripods! The lens itself is solid as well, though there is a perpetual spot that's not from dirt on the lens. These do not carry the kit, unfortunately. The tripod itself might be worth a buy if it were separate.",

                "reviewText": "Unfortunately, I have to say that I'm pretty disappointed with my purchase. The camera is cheaply made and does not perform well.Firstly, the image quality is subpar. The camera produces grainy and blurry images, which is disappointing considering that it's a digital camera. The colors are also washed out and not true to life.The camera's build quality is also lacking. It feels flimsy and cheaply made, and I worry about how long it will last. The buttons are stiff and unresponsive, making it difficult to adjust settings quickly.The camera's user interface is confusing and difficult to navigate. It's not intuitive, and I found myself struggling to figure out how to adjust basic settings like the flash and timer.Finally, the camera's battery life is abysmal. I had to replace the batteries multiple times during a short photo shoot, which is unacceptable.Overall, I regret purchasing this off-brand digital camera. Its image quality is subpar, the build quality is lacking, the user interface is confusing, and the battery life is abysmal. If you're looking for a quality digital camera, I would recommend looking elsewhere.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this camera to try and make YouTube cooking videos. The camera feels and looks decent upon initial unboxing. I wanted a camera with a flip up view to see what I am recording in real time. After some testing with this camera, it\u2019s not as nice or high quality picture as I would have wanted. The recorded video colors seem to be a little on the yellow/red side and also the picture is a little grainy and does not seem to be very HD. The focus seems too fragmented and not smooth when zooming in, more like 10% increments instead of gradual. I am used to using an iPhone so was expecting a pretty nice recording from this, but I may just stick with the phone recordings for now. Overall the camera seems a little cheaper then I expected and not sure I\u2019ll use this to produce my videos. I will update if I can figure out a way to make the videos look better. It may be a lighting issue because I was recording without the best lighting but I\u2019m not hopeful that will correct all of my quality issues.",
