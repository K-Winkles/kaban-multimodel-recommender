He still needs help getting the settings of course, but he loves pushing the button to take the photo and that it prints instantly. I have a thermal printer at home so I knew what the image would look like. It prints black and white and not very high quality compared to an actual photo, but it\u2019s perfect for us. Would be great for a child a little bit older than my son to take on vacation or to any outing.",

The beauty of this gem is you can selfie, it prints a black and white, (not bad image) that she can give her classmate AND has a card inside so a color image is ALSO taken for her mom to print the images. Win win.I dislike it has games on it however, just drains the battery.",
