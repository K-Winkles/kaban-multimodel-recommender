BUT!!! if you\u2019re having this problem, make sure you formatted the memory card!!!! unfortunately if you didn\u2019t format it from the beginning, your photos/videos from before you formatted the memory card will be gone. but in my opinion i\u2019d rather have a working camera than photos that i can\u2019t even look at because of the constant freezing. i hope this helps someone cuz this was so frustrating for me!now on a more positive note.. after fixing this camera, it\u2019s back to its original state! super cute and compact, very convenient for travel and gives a super cute 2000\u2019s vibe with the photos. so far i haven\u2019t had any problems with the battery life either! i definitely recommend this camera.",
