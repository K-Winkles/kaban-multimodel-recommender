The notification is almost instant, which is great.Settings for motion censor sensitivity, length of the recordings... are all very easy to navigate. And it's easy to delete older recordings so you don't end up with a million videos in your library :)Overall a great camera and app for a great price, that does exactly what it's supposed to.

This was key for me, as it is placed in the eave of my garage, and it can be used without running electrical power to the space. And, the camera is waterproof - so no worries in the rain and snow of the upper Midwest!The picture is excellent - even when the night vision is active. Very clear to see whatever comes into the camera's view. Motion detection sensitivity can be adjusted as well; I have it set so that anything closer to the camera is detected, but passing cars in the street will not activate the camera.The unit was very easy to set up, has a slot for a storage card and I have had no issues with it whatsoever. Excellent value for the price; I highly recommend this unit!",

                "reviewText": "I bought 6 of these cameras to install one each in my family room, front door, living room, garage driveway, side alley & backyard. So far it has been working like a charm! Few cameras have all the features as this one:1) The camera works indoor & outdoor, no problem.2) It is very easy to install and setup. Simple plug & play3) Great picture quality & perspective. It does the job its expected to do great!4) Excellent VicoHome mobile app that allows you to view live, recorded video, control night vision, video fidelity & many other settings etc5) You can share the cameras to be added to your family member's account6) It allows you to change the wifi once setup. My old Yi camera does not allow this, so once i upgraded my wifi router I still had to keep the old router connected. You can easily upgrade your wifi router & keep this camera7) It can operate with battery or power. So even if there is a power cut it will continue to function8) It has local SD card storage. I set mine up with 128 GB card. It can save all motion detected videos locally and also in free cloud storage of up to 3 days. This is huge as you don't need a subscription to operate the camera. My handyman was surprised i don't have to pay every monthSo nothing to complain so far. And to top it all, it is very affordable compared to other cameras. Great product!Like all products here are some things I found as opportunities to improve this already great product even further:1) Consider providing a bigger USB cable either by default or as add-on. Out door installations typically need at least a 6ft cable2) The initial connectivity to individual cameras is a bit slow (slower than my old Yi camera) and it only connects to one camera at a time. This seems like a mobile app enhancement that can be easily done3) The mobile app shows camera in the reverse order in which they were added (latest installed first). It will be good to allow the cameras to listed in alphabetical or customer preferred order4) Consider adding a desktop app to this kick ass product.",

                "reviewText": "I honestly didn't expect a high-quality camera for this price, but I was pleasantly surprised. I bought the camera in response to a car theft in the parking area behind my house. The police said that just knowing the type of vehicle the suspects drove up in would have been helpful, so I was just going for something quick and inexpensive. The camera was super easy to install with just a screwdriver, and it covers both my front door area and the parking area. The image is crystal clear, and the motion detection has been extremely accurate. The software allows you to be notified of vehicles, humans, or wildlife (aside from humans), or you can exclude certain types of traffic. I opted out of notifications for moving cars as I don't need to see every car that goes past. This is just an all-around great camera, and seriously, the price can't be beat. I highly recommend this camera.This review is for the \"1080P Security WiFi Cameras for Home Security, Wireless Outdoor with Motion Detection, Spotlight/Siren Alarm, Color Night Vision, 2-Way Talk, Waterproof SD/Cloud Storage Battery Powered\"",

I use it without running electrical power and the camera is waterproof.The picture is great, even when the night vision is active. Very clear to see whatever comes into the camera's view. Motion detection sensitivity can be adjusted as well; I have it set so that anything closer to the camera is detected.The unit was very easy to set up and has a slot for a storage card.",

It does make you upgrade if you want to see more than just 20 seconds of recording, so the free version doesn\u2019t capture full recordings if someone is outside for longer than a few seconds, hence the 4 stars.",
