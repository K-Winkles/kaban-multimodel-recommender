It is made of high molecular polyester material that is durable and can withstand all kinds of weather. The two-way talk function allows me to communicate with anyone under the camera, which is great for monitoring deliveries or speaking to visitors.Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase of the DF220 wireless camera. If you are looking for a high-quality surveillance camera that is easy to use and provides excellent performance, then this is the camera for you. I highly recommend it! Hopefully they keep updating the software and allow for even longer recording time on SD card than 30 seconds per event.",

Lo he arreglado con un cable para acercar la placa a una zona mejor.La detecci\u00f3n de movimiento funciona bien. Detecta el movimiento de un perro a unos 5-6 metros sin problema. A las personas mucho mejor.La app de control bien, se ha actualizado al menos una vez. Es f\u00e1cil y sencilla de controlar.El precio creo que no ha variado nada este a\u00f1o.

                "reviewText": "Questa \u00e8 la seconda che acquisto, dopo aver testato per bene e con successo la prima, per coprire aree esterne senza possibilit\u00e0 di presa di corrente.Quindi il primo bisogno \u00e8 l'autonomia energetica e nulla da dire: basta caricarla al 100% prima di installarla poi col suo pannellino solare, anche in lunghi periodi di brutto tempo (settimana d'acqua tipica dell'autunno del nord), difficilmente scende sotto l'80% di carica. Su questo fronte assolutamente promossa, da valutare durata del pannellino (esposto agli elementi) nel tempo.Qualit\u00e0 delle riprese non al top ma giustificabile visto il costo (non possono certo metterci sensori al top e lenti Zeiss). Forse meglio quelle notturne (che ho lasciato in B/N) che quelle diurne, comunque assolutamente adeguate in ogni condizione di luce. Anche l'illuminazione IR notturna \u00e8 OK, buon cono di visibilit\u00e0 (tanto dipende anche dal posizionamento). Personalmente le ho installate con una piccola tettoia sopra per evitare che quando piove l'obiettivo si ricopra di gocce, ma talvolta con eventi seri (temporali) capita che per qualche tempo la visibilit\u00e0 sia un po' compromessa e/o appannata. Un trattamento anti-goccia non farebbe schifo ma per il costo non si pu\u00f2 davvero pretendere. Quindi promossa anche su questo fronte.Sensibilit\u00e0 del PIR. Buono e talvolta percepisce movimenti anche a 15 metri e oltre di distanza, tanto che di notte la causa del movimento (spesso animali) si intravede a mala pena nella ripresa, nella zona in ombra dall'illuminazione IR. Unico problema \u00e8 che talvolta, coi raggi del sole bassi (alba/tramonto d'estate, pi\u00f9 spesso autunno/inverno) si attiva il PIR e parte l'allarme (e si attiva la registrazione). Inoltre prima di trovare la corretta sensibilit\u00e0 (regolabile da App) bisogna fare alcune prove in quanto dipende tanto da posizionamento, luce diretta e altri fattori (es. piante nei pressi che si muovono al vento). Quindi diciamo funzionalit\u00e0 probabilmente migliorabile ma assolutamente adeguata.Connettivit\u00e0 Wi-FI. Usa solo 2,4GHz (ma va bene cos\u00ec) e la connessione \u00e8 decisamente stabile e adeguatamente veloce malgrado la fonte di segnale Wi-Fi non sia vicinissima (quasi 40 metri) e dentro casa. Salvo condizioni meteo particolari manda allarmi, si collega e riproduce senza problemi. Connettivit\u00e0 decisamente OK.Installazione e gestione con l'App (io uso CloudEdge) davvero facili e senza problemi (con un minimo di dimestichezza con questi dispositivi).Un difetto? L'audio in ingresso. Talvolta gracchia un po' sia in presa diretta che in registrazione ma nulla di drammatico. Da valutare inoltre se colpa della videocamera o da eventuali disturbi elettromagnetici esterni; nei pressi ad esempio c'\u00e8 una recinzione elettrica (anti-cinghiali) ad alto voltaggio e potrebbe dipendere da quello (dovrei provare a spostarle per verificare ma non essendo un gran problema me ne faccio una ragione).Conclusioni: considerato il costo (spesso anche ridotto grazie al coupon) per me un best buy.",
