                "reviewText": "We got this for our newborn, and while I thought the camera looked like a little higher quality than it was in real life, the whole system works as advertised. For the price, this is a good buy as it works to monitor the baby and make it so we know when they wake up. It has a VOX setting that turns off the screen and sound so that you can sleep with it at night; while I like the feature, it doesn\u2019t work real well with having a white noise machine because the white noise keeps it on at the first two levels, and on the highest level it turns on and off too much. The monitor part is nice, it has a good battery life and you can take it around the house with you as needed. Overall, because it was as cheap as it is, I would recommend this for anyone looking for a cheap baby monitor.",

The glitches I\u2019ve experienced and it honestly could be a defect for my unit but the picture goes out, and sound goes off at random times for about 5-10 seconds at a time. The screen will turn blue on one side and have an image on the other.However the sound/volume is great. The picture is clear enough for a camera. It\u2019s not hi-def but it\u2019s cheap so\u2026the fact that I can black to screen and still have it on is a plus for night time since I don\u2019t like additional light at night.",

Superb audio pickup. I can hear every little coo and noise the little guy makes, even his breathing! It\u2019s super easy to setup, just plug the camera in somewhere and the monitor connects right to it. No apps, no WiFi. The 2-way audio works good as well. Took me a while to realize this, but you can mount the camera stand to a wall and get more viewing angles. Just TWO things I wish were different; the standard view seems zoomed in already. I know I\u2019m not on the 2x zoom mode. It\u2019s just how to camera is. Also, the battery life on the monitor could be improved. Not so sure about the 19 hour lifespan they say it has.",

                "reviewText": "I can't say enough good things about this baby monitor! It's everything I was looking for, and here are a few highlights that make it stand out1. Closed Loop System for Enhanced Security: One of the standout features of this baby monitor is that it's a closed loop system, which means it's not connected to Wi-Fi. This provides peace of mind knowing that there's no chance of hackers accessing your baby monitor feed. In a world filled with security concerns, having a baby monitor that prioritizes safety is a huge plus.2. Microphone Sensitivity: The sensitivity of the microphone on this monitor is incredible. It picks up even the slightest sounds, allowing me to hear my baby's every breath and whimper during the night. This feature has been a game-changer for us, especially for monitoring our baby's well-being.3. Impressive Battery Life and Affordable Price: The battery life of this monitor is exceptional. I can go for hours without worrying about it dying on me, giving me the flexibility to move around the house while keeping an ear on my little one. Plus, the price is fantastic for the quality you get. It's a budget-friendly option that doesn't compromise on performance.Overall, this baby monitor has exceeded my expectations. It provides top-notch security, superb microphone sensitivity, long-lasting battery life, all at an affordable price. I highly recommend it to any parent looking for a reliable and worry-free way to keep an eye on their baby. It's been a lifesaver for me, and I couldn't be happier with this purchase!",

It's no frills, but for the price...gets the job done.",

This thing isn\u2019t very clear the image you\u2019re seeing is a stock image. The video feeds is rather strong which was impressive. The mic and voice is lacking. The temperature is never accurate. It does coke with a mount so that good I think but some 3m double sided would work too.The lcd screen isn\u2019t viewing friendly. You have to look directly at it otherwise it\u2019s all distorted. The volume on it is horrible. The battery take a long time to charge I left it over night more than 8 hours for it to be completely full. Only use it for 30 minutes and it already lost a bar.The camera viewing angle is minimalistic, mic is horrible, speaker is meh. It does rotate and move up and down easily. Once set you forget it. Auto it doesn\u2019t really do a good job of monitoring because my baby was moving and whining and it didn\u2019t even pick it up. I\u2019ve mounted it like 5ft away with direct line of sight to my baby. Night vision is garbage as well.",
