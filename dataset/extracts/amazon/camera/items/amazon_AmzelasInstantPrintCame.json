I have ordered several other different brand cameras and had to send back 3 of them because of how bad they printed. Of all of the different cameras I bought this one is the BEST! It prints the best quality and is actually cheaper than a couple of the other ones I purchased. It even has a flash, can zoom in and out, has a selfie mirror on the front with flash. I haven't tried the video yet or the other fun things with the camera but I bought this for the photo and print and it works beautifully! I would recommend! 5 Stars!",

                "reviewText": "i am solidly outside of the intended age bracket here, and i love this thing. the purple/orange color scheme is so very cute. the shape and size is super cute and comfortable to hold.the camera itself of course isn't the best quality ever. it goes up to 8mpx, which can honestly produce good photos in my experience, but the lens is what you'd expect from this pricepoint, and i don't mind one bit. it adds character! very simple to transfer the images to my computer.it's a bit annoying that it sets to auto print photos every time you turn the camera on, but i just got used to turning it off. the paper's so cheap, i don't really care how much i waste. just be aware that, same as receipts, the printed photos will eventually fade, and there's absolutely no way to stop that. but again, it's very easy to transfer the images from the SD card (32gb mind you!) that i don't really care.it also annoys me that i can't adjust the date and time. or rather, i can, but every single time the camera turns off, it snaps right back to february of 2023, so i just gave up. i don't really care, but if the date stamp matters to you, i'd maybe check out a different thermal printing camera.anyways, this thing is cute, durable, and does what it says it will. i take it with me to places sometimes and people think it's so fun. i got it on sale for 30 bucks and don't regret it one bit.",

                "reviewText": "Early Valentines gift for my 10 year old grandson. He went crazy, loves this camera with its games and apps, so much. I love it because it's so easy he can do everything on his own, including load the paper. This was a FIND because most kid cameras have to use expensive photo papers or ink. Very economical, thermal printing, his ex-service veteran dad recognized this immediately. Wonderful gift works perfectly.",

Just load a roll of the pretty well-priced thermal paper and start pushing the button. Boom! Photos. Sure, they are small, black&white and not the best quality but I find that rather charming. It\u2019s ton of fun to be able to take as many pictures as you want and get them instantly. Great purchase.",
