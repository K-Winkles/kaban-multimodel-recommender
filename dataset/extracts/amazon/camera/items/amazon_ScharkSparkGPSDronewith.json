It beeps, but not how the manuals say it will, and then does nothing. I haven't seen a rotor spin yet, nor does it seem to calibrate even with a full signal. Very frustrating...what a waste of time and expectations.Additional note: Part of the problem was that I was using an iPhone to run the app. When I switched to some old Samsung Android phone, then the app worked much better and I was able to get it to take off. But note that originally the remote control didn't work either with the first iteration (I returned the whole thing and they sent another). In this second iteration now, I was able to calibrate with the Android app and then the remote control worked. But on the second takeoff and \"landing\" it crashed landed and one of the motors now won't work. Good thing I bought the warranty...if I even keep the device. I'm thinking of returning completely and washing my hands of it. Ridiculous!",

The camera quality is not bad at all. Controls make it really easy to fly, even for my nephew. The features on the app really make it easy to use, i did not expect to have similar features to dji in this cheap of a drone, but they work great.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The drone is easier to fly than a typical cheap drone. The price fits the performance. If the GPS is set up correctly, it will hold its general location with some vertical variation. It really depends a lot on initial setup for drones in general (after trying out a few). It's not as good as a more expensive holy stone hd700e for example but it had similar performance with the calibration and setup done (in terms of stability and ease of flying). Seems you always have to do some calibration with more advanced drones if the drone isn't taking off from the same spot. The return function worked well.It has been windy and I was surprised it actually held its position through some strong gusts. Seemed to be more steady during them in fact. If the headlights are blinking fast, there's no GPS and it won't hold its position so well. It worked better indoors than the holy stone that crashed immediately inside but that again might be calibration.There's a microSD card slot for recording directly with the drone. There are also maybe 5 cameras on the thing. 3 down, 2 forward. The forward cameras are electronically controlled. I'm still looking for a way to access them. Note there's actually plastic covering the larger camerasIt's a good drone. You have to read the instructions carefully.",
