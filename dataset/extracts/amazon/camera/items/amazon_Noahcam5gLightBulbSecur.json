This light bulb camera is really cost effective and I just need to insert one micro SD card for local storage. Comparing to the ring cameras:1. It is super easy to install and setup(just replace the old bulb with it and pair using the downloaded free app in minutes). And you don't need to handle those fuzzy fire/neutral/ground wires.2. Its HD video is even clearer than my Ring cameras.3. It has a human tracking feature the Ring does not have.4. You can also enable the smart night vision and enable the white light warning function to make it work perfectly like a floodlight security camera(same as what my Ring floodlight garage camera does).5. It supports 2-way talking(same as what my Ring doorbell does).Anyway it not only has everything Ring products have(some features are smarter and better) but also provides a lot more features that Ring does not have(like the cruise, PTZ, invert image upside down, etc). I regret not buying this one earlier. And I plan to buy more for my backyard and 2 sides of my house.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this camera because the one I previously had only worked with a certain type of wifi. We recently had to switch our wifi over and our old camera stopped working. Ordering this camera was the best decision I ever made. It was easy to install (just screw it into the light fixture) outside our home, downloaded the app on the devices we would be using to access it and that was it.The cool thing about this camera is there are several features it has that the old one didn't have. For 1) it has infrared which allows us to still see what is happening at night; 2) there is a 2-way speaker that not only allows me to talk to the person in view of the camera but they can also speak back to me; 3) It has motion detection alerts. You can set it to where the siren goes off anytime there is human detection; and 4) It has uninterrupted recording which you can change over to event recording if you prefer.The visual is very clear in the day and night. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a little extra security. We have a regular security system but we are using this one to cover the blindspot that is not picked up by our other camera system. Great investment and great price.",

                "reviewText": "At first I was impressed with this camera because of all the different features and settings but the problem is when you go to purchase iCloud storage. My car was badly vandalized by someone that the police have been advising me to get a restraining order against. I had already purchased continuous recoding and Cloud storage but I wasn\u2019t able to playback the footage from the night before, it just said \u201cBuy\u201d and redirected me to a page where you can pay for 7-day playback. I paid and it charged me twice and I STILL cannot access the much needed footage that I need for the police! I\u2019ve emailed for support and nobody is getting back to me. Thank god I had a Blink camera set up that showed the perpetrator lurking around my property in the middle of the night but I cannot access the footage where car is being vandalized because clearly the the cloud storage thing is a scam. Maybe it works better with an SD card but I can\u2019t risk it, I also noticed the \u201cevent\u201d alert is not 100% reliable and does not go off every time a human passes by. Overall very disappointed in this product, the bad far outweighs the good and I have yet to hear back from anyone. If you sincerely feel your life is at risk and need a good camera, do not take a gamble on this one please, it\u2019s not worth the stress and agony!",

Picture quality is good, motion detection is also good , no MT card so I'll need to order on to fit so I can review any recordings made via motion detection. Can't really complain for the cost , overall I'd say it's a good product.",
