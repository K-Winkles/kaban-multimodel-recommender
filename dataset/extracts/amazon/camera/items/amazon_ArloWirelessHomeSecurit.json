                "reviewText": "Overall this system works very good. It is so easy to set up that even someone with very basic knowledge with Wi Fi routers would be able to do it. The camera clarity is excellent. The range is good but not excellent. If you have a very large house and try to cover it with one system you could encounter Wi Fi signal strength issues. I am running five cameras, one outside and have no issues. But if I were to add another outside camera on the opposite end of the house from the base station, there might be a signal issue. The cameras are very easy to mount, even with the mounting system provided. I purchased optional mounts and found that I could have done quite well with the provided mounts. The motion detection and recording is excellent. The second someone comes to my front door I get an alert and it records the event for a preset amount of time. This can also be turned off. You can set cameras to record independently of each other. There are only two things that could make the system better. The first issue is sometimes it takes the system a little time to go live when selecting that command. At times it is fast and other times it is slower. But overall is works well. The other issue is programming rules. This should be simplified. The instructions are not thorough enough so you have to experiment with the setting through trial and error. Once you understand what to do it is fine. But there is a learning curve that could have been made easier with improved instructions or better software programming. That is my only two issues with the system. However, I do have an issue with the company. Three days after I had my perfectly working system up and going all functionality stopped. It was dead. I thought something went haywire with the system so I deleted everything out and started over again. It was a real pain and I thought if this happened once it was going to be an unstable system. Then I found out through posts on Twitter that the company was apologizing for down time because they were installing a revamped update to the system. In actuality there was nothing wrong with my system at all, but I went through all that trouble of reinstalling the system because of not knowing they were doing an update. I ask you folks, wouldn't it be common sense for the company to send an advance email alert notifying owners about the update and pending down time? I sure hope they do in the future. With all that said I have to say I like the system and can recommend it. Never owning a system like this I can't compare it to other systems but this system works almost perfectly for me. I can't attest to the battery life but I have had the system up and running for two weeks and still showing full batteries. It also has good clarity when it switches to \"night mode\". It can see in the dark with black and white images.",

                "reviewText": "I just got this delivered today. I ordered it because of a few odd things that have happened (and to catch the unknown neighbor leaving their dog-poop bag on my lawn) and to feel a little more secure when I'm not home. It's probably a little early for me to leave a fair and impartial review, but as of right now....I love this little camera.I did a significant amount of reviewing and searching and comparing before I made my purchase. I didn't over think but I didn't impulse buy either. I wasn't looking for some god awful ugly outdoor city street intersection design, nor was I looking for the \"black dome\" federal building cam. I also didn't want to run power cords over the eaves, down the molding, and through the house or be stuck with the only outdoor outlet location that I have. Wireless totally caught my eye, and if the batteries last longer than a couple months, then to me that is a huge win. That plus the sleek, adorable, sexy, slim design...ohhh-la-la!I was like a kid at Christmas when I opened the box. Included in the kit was (1) camera, (4) batteries, (1) hub, (1) power cord (1) ethernet cable, (2) magnetic mounts with screws, start up directions.I am not and IT wiz, but I can hold my own. This set up was SO easy. I will say this....I had a friend here who kept my package-opening-excitement in check. He told me \"follow the directions exactly as they tell you\". Ok,, I could have easily jumped and gone out of order. If I did would there have been a problem? I can't say but I did read other reviews where some had difficulty. I had none. Plug in, wait for the hub to connect to the wifi, while that was happening start my online account, sync, and away we go! I have all Apple products and I did not have any download or viewing problems or any need for add on software.For now I have the default set on \"optimum\" to see how the battery life does with the video quality and 80% sensitivity.Video quality. Clear, true color, and bright. There is a zoom option when viewing from my phone. Yes, in zoom at the current settings it can get a bit grainy. I wouldn't be getting this to read serial numbers on dollar bills going into a cash register, but for what I was looking for, I am impressed. I tested the night vision camera going down to the basement and I think it's great. Like I said, no serial numbers on bills, but you can definitely see what it is that your looking at. (While writing this the notification banner keeps popping up. The bugs by the porch light are doing a jig triggering the camera. I will keep this in mind when I find the best mounting place.)Currently I don't have it mounted on it is on my front porch railing (don't try to come steal it, I will see you!!!). I have a porch light and front yard pole light that are on all night. I have already checked the quality of the viewing. Porch light on or off doesn't change it much. I'm thrilled.Motion detection. As mentioned, I don't have it mounted yet and it is at mid-drift level. I don't think it is at the best location to say one way or another how well the detection is. From what I can tell already is that you have to keep in mind where it is located an what you think it will trigger. From my porch to my driveway where a car would normally park is about 25 - 30 feet and about 60 feet to the road. It might not pick up the movement of a car coming in but if someone walks up the walkway it will.I ordered the \"stick\" mount for it. That will be here tomorrow. Once I have that I am going to take the time to test which mount I will use and the location for the best viewing and motion detection.Notifications. I have it set up for email and banner alerts. When motion is detected, a banner alert (like a text message) will pop up (settings depending on your phone). It immediately starts the camera to record. There is a red light on the camera indicating that it has been triggered. I have it set for 120 seconds of recording time. Once it is done recording it will send you an email notification which proves a link for viewing. Since this is coming from the \"cloud\" it takes 2 minutes recording time plus another say 30 seconds for the email. You can view real time once the banner alerts you. It seems like there is a little lag in connecting, but I was doing it all on my home wifi at the same time. It will be interesting to see if that lag goes away when I'm away from the house on 3G or other internet.I will update this in a week or so with new findings. But as of right night I AM VERY VERY PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE. If you are looking to solve crimes or protect Fort Knox, this might not be your best choice and I'm sure there are higher priced more technical cameras out there to buy. But you you want a good quality, modern, completely wireless FREE viewing home safety/surveillance camera for added comfort, then this is a very good buy.",

                "reviewText": "I wasn't sure what to expect after having set up a couple of different camera systems for my home in the past. But the Arlo system is incredibly simple to get going, no complicated steps or having to find additional information anywhere. Video quality is great for the price range.The app is easy to use and works great. There are different levels of plans, but the free plan does everything I want it to do so far, so this has been a great investment, especially on sale. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a relatively inexpensive home security system without having to wire things through the house.The couple little annoyances I have found is that there doesn't seem to be a way to specify an area of the view range to detect motion in. So wherever you have it pointed, it will notify you every single time there's movement in the frame. I have 2 cameras that I would like to keep an eye on the front of my house, and I've tried to position them to avoid the street and sidewalk, but there are small areas in the corners of the frame that cars or people may walk through, so there's a lot more recording happening than I would prefer. The other thing that I wasn't super thrilled with is the notification system; I want to get notified of the motion sensor being triggered, but if you have push notifications enabled, you will get the push notification as well as an email. I have blocked the alert email address because it was driving me nuts. So now I just get the push notifications. But because of the other issue I just mentioned, every time there's the tiniest motion detected, it sends a notification. If you were able to specify which part(s) of the view to detect motion in, it would solve both issues.Anyway, otherwise I think they're great and can't wait to see how they hold up in -30 degree weather.",

                "reviewTitle": "Not as good as I thought",
                "reviewText": "I researched many cameras before deciding on the Arlo. I liked the idea of totally wireless. Many cams say they are wireless but they always have a power plug, so they are not actually wireless. The Arlo operates on batteries and thus, totally wireless. Cams were easy to set up and were working in 15 minutes. The Arlo app is excellent and works well. Great to see what's going on when I am not at home.That's where it ends. These cameras are NOT as good as I thought. They need to be mounted very close to what you want to monitor. I mounted the cameras on the outer wall of my house outside the second floor window pointing down. I did this so they would be out of arms reach of being stolen. Doing this, they were mounted at a distance from what I wanted to monitor, so the quality is not that good. Night vision at a distance is terrible. All that said, the cameras are okay to see what's going on.After a week, one of the cameras went offline and I tried everything to get it going again. It did not happen. Finally called Netgear and the rep suggested changing the batteries. I told her the cameras are new and the batteries should not need changing but I did it anyway and the camera worked! The camera worked off and on for two days and went offline again. The new set of batteries were done. Countless email exchanges with Netgear and all kinds of suggestions what to do with camera. Finally after more than two weeks of never ending email exchanges, Netgear figured the cam was defective and wanted to exchange it for a new one. The catch? User pays for shipping returns and it's $25.00! What!? What kind of return policy is this? I purchased a defective camera! I told them no thanks, I will return the entire package to Amazon for a refund. Doh! With the endless and pointless email exchanges with Netgear, I missed the return window with Amazon by a day. Not sure if they did this on purpose.Bottom line, cameras are okay but just okay. Cameras need to be close to what you want to monitor and they have bad nightvision. Netgear customer service is questionable and their return policy is horrible.UPDATE 3 MONTHS LATER: All 3 cameras keep going offline. It is usually a problem with the batteries but not always, sometime the cams just need to be re synced. All three cam are within 25 feet of the base unit. Batteries usually last about 5 weeks and then have to be changed. In the 8 months of owning these Arlo cams I have gone through 36 batteries and these are not your standard AA batteries. I have spent over $120.00 just in batteries.I have had it with these cams and throw them out when when my battery supply runs out. I have 12 batteries left. I will accept the $550.00 loss with the purchase of these cams. I would not even think of selling them to someone unsuspecting. They are junk and I am too honest.With this update, I have changed my two star rating to a one. I would give it a zero if I could.",
