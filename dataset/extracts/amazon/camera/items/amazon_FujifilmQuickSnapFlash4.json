                "reviewText": "Fantastic cameras! Bought these because a friend of mine had them too and I wanted to start making more solidified memories in pictures. Used in mostly outdoor settings, but the indoor photos with flash turned out great as well. I did take a few indoor photos without flash and those ones did not turn out as well. Definitely need good lighting in any environment for a good picture. The final prints weren\u2019t very sharp, but it\u2019s a disposable camera so I\u2019m not expecting digital camera quality. Overall, 10/10 for the experience and the memories I can now look back on.(I included an example photo)",
