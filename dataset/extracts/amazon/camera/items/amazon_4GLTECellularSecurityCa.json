                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is my 5th Soliom camera. They have proven themselves to be durable and useful. I needed one more to see the other side of my house and inside my carport.The box comes with a camera, (smaller than the S600) a mount for it, solar panel, extension cord for the solar panel, screws and anchors, mounting templates that are stickers, and a manual.The extension cord is a must if you want a camera where the sun doesn't shine. The templates I have never used, but it's nice that they are stickers so you don't have to tape it to your surface and risk removing paint. I always just use the included screws and my battery powered impact driver to drive the screws right in through the holes in the mounts. No pre-drilling necessary for small screws like those into wooden surfaces.Make sure to charge the camera fully before you install it. They don't ship fully charged because it's not good for the batteries when not in use to be fully charged.I use a 128GB SD card for video storage so I don't have to pay for cloud storage. It's nice to have the option, unlike the popular brands that have no SD card option so you are forced into paying for cloud storage if you want to view anything from the past.The camera is easy to pair to your 2.4ghz network and the app is intuitive and responsive.The video quality is awesome for cameras in this price range. You can toggle between SD and HD quality if capacity is a concern. The camera has the option of turning on a bright light at night and recording color video when motion is detected. The other option is to record in night vision black and white. During the day it's color.The two way audio works well for speaking with people. The sound is coming out of the camera and coming from the camera in the app.The solar panels do a wonderful job of charging the cameras. I had one that would die after a few minutes and customer service was responsive. I unfortunately had to charge it again for some reason. After that one occurrence these stay charged and haven't run out of battery even during the gloomy Michigan winters.The only thing I wish they would work on is a way to integrate it into my Google home displays like a nest. That road block is the fault of Google I would assume though. They want you to buy their subscription based camera systems.Overall these are great cameras! I know I have another blind spot to cover in the back I will be buying another one for!",

After connecting, I was pleased to find that the solar panel is very effective in keeping the camera fully charged. The pan and tilt feature is great. The picture quality on SD or HD is terrific. All in all, a great value for the money. Product quality and performance is excellent.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Well-featured & reliable cameras for the price",
                "reviewText": "EDIT: Removing one star for the \u201cPlease log in again\u201d glitch. I should not have to log in *every single time* I use the app.Original review continues below:I have purchased several of the Soliom cameras for on & around my house. My property is ~17,000 sq ft, so as a result some of the cameras are 100 ft from the wifi extenders or more, and they still work quite reliably. Ymmv, however if you have a strong 2.4g signal you should be ok.I have a mix of the S90 units and the S600 units. I prefer the newer model as it has a slightly wider field of vision (even while stationary), the option for night vision or flood light, and of course the pan & tilt feature. The S600 also seems to adapt to lighting conditions upon user wakeup better than the S90.Soliom recommends that you charge the unit fully before installation, however when installing one of these I did not notice that the device was only at 50% until after it was mounted. Still, in only partial shade and with daily use, it charged to full using only the sun in less than a week. The company also makes users update to the new Soliom+ version of the app, which seems annoying since 1) they ask for an email registration and 2) older devices (such as the early S90s) require a firmware update. However, please note that the app does not require a valid email to work, and the firmware update is pretty painless.The lack of 5g wifi support was initially frustrating, however 2.4g does travel farther, so this makes sense. The setup workaround (rather than turning off your 5g for installation) is to simply move out of 5g range while pairing the camera. Once installed, the cameras find the 2.4g network fine, with no interference while the 5g signal is broadcasting.The only problems I have had with these cameras:- After heavy rain this season, one of the cameras stopped working. Upon inspection, I noticed that the silicone cap protecting the external usb cable had come off. After a couple hours of charging, the unit (which had also previously lost one of the antennas to a tree branch) seems to be working again, so maybe the rain had shorted something temporarily. Time will tell.- One of the units shipped without the o-ring between the solar panel and the camera. The device is mounted under an eave, so I\u2019m not too concerned.- There is some delay between the motion sensing detecting activity and being able to pull up the feed, however if you have cloud or SD recording, the activity seems to be captured on the footage. I have been alerted twice to people on my property (and several times to wildlife).- SD card in the device records reliably, and video can be downloaded to your device (at least with the S600/ app v1.1.16/ iPhone), however saved video sometimes does not start on \u201cplay\u201d. Workaround for problematic playback (or for the S90) is to use screen recording.Tldr...Pros:- Reliable- Self-charging- Setup is not difficult- Fairly good (1080p) quality- Good field of view- Good feature upgrade from previous models- Two-way audioCons:- Some lag when activating video feed- Mic quality (receiving) could be better- Recording/downloading options could be better- Zoom is digital, not optical- Documentation & app could use more review (earlier versions of app had some misspellings)- App only supports 8 cameras- Newer Soliom+ app does not support QR code \u201csharing\u201d of cameras between family members (this feature was very convenient)- No 5g supportOverall, a good value. Have not found anything better in the wireless category at this price point.",
