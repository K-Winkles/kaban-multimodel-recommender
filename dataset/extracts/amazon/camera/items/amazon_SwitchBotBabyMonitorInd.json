                "reviewText": "I kind of bought this on a lark as I love the SwitchBot button toggle. That one is actually my favorite smart device as it can start my record player remotely! So cool. The pan tilt camera is growing on me though. Originally bought it to establish proof of life for the cats when we are traveling. I wasn\u2019t expecting much, given the price, but despite being cheap, it works pretty well. Good v1 design. It is super quiet and I love that I can save the video to a micro SD card. The remote access is pretty good, if a little slow to connect at times. Best of all, the tracking works! Easily follows me and my wife around when we leave it on and usually catches the cats too. I think it is a little spotty at night with the cats but we still get hits. I do wish you had more control over the sensitivity. All in, it is prob the best bang for your buck in the space. I mean it is a v1 design, so don\u2019t expect perfection. It is an affordable and easy to use device that does everything I was looking for. Also the SwitchBot customer service is super cute. Nice job guys!",

                "reviewText": "Have had this running for 2 weeks now, along with a Switchbot Mini, while I am away from my home. 5 days in, this unit went offline but the mini has been working fine. The only good thing I can say about this is that the video quality if excellent when it is working.Had someone to check on the house and restarted this camera so it's back online. Will see how long it stays online this time. I have checked firmware of the camera and it is the latest.While someone was at the house, I got to watch video real time and got recorded video. I have to say I have very mixed feelings about motion tracking. When I am watching real time video, the view kept shifting because the camera detected movements. This became very annoying as it became very hard to see what I am actually trying to see. The the motion tracking video is disappointing as well. I included the one as example. When motion is detected, somehow camera first moves a bit in opposite direction, then a pause, then it moved the other way to catch up with the movement. As you can see in video, by the time it swings back, the person is already gone and camera wasn't able to reacquire. Basically I got a flash of a person passing by and that was it. It would have been better if motion tracking was disabled. Annoying part is that this doesn't happen all the time. 50% of the time it does catch the person again and was able to track the movement.It seems to me that these are all software issues that can be addressed easily. Perhaps motion tracking can be turned off when viewing real time and while it is being controlled by the app.The app is also disappointing in that I can only connect to one camera at a time. On the home screen, you get tiles of cameras available but you can not view the videos in the tiled format. So if you have multiple of these and watch to watch all corners of your house at the same time, this would not work for you. If these cameras work with another app that could allow you the tiled view, I don't know about those yet.Edit: Have not gone offline again so that could be a one time incident.",

                "reviewText": "I am re-reviewing this item (08/01/2022)----------After contact with the manufacturer, my camera is working fine. When I input my WiFi password, it still puts up a warning. BUT, after a moment or two, that warning goes away and a QR code appears.I never got that QR code before. After letting the camera scan the code, which takes 1-5 seconds, the camera responded and began working on my network.Now my camera is working as it should. My phone, tablet (both Android) and Alexa Show can all work with it just fine.I am not sure what \"fixed\" the issue, but everything is working.I left the original 1 star review below, but NONE of it applies now. I would recommend this camera for it's small size, good picture quality, low price and features.--- Original review below. See above. NONE OF THIS IS TRUE, NOW! ---I received my unit and within 20 minutes of trying to set it up, I am returning it.When it asked for my WiFi password, I was informed by the app that my password was \"too long\" and that I needed to make MY WiFi password shorter. It is ~35 characters longThe standard for WiFi passwords is over 60 characters.Needless to say, telling your customers to change their security to meet the product's needs is just plain WRONG!If you have a short (and therefore a little more easily hacked) password, then go ahead. It may be a great product. But when a product demands I lower my security to meet THEIR needs, they can stuff it.",
