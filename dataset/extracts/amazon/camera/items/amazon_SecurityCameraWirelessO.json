I had heard about famous surveillance cameras in the market but they were all expensive. I just came across this camera by chance, while looking for cameras thinking it may not that good as the famous ones. Vow. Boy, I am surprised. This camera is not only far less expensive but turned out to be super good. It has all the features that you can find in an expensive camera. It has a very clear view even at night, has a sound ability both ways ( can talk and hear), record what you see. It is very easy to operate. It comes with a rechargeable battery. I was not expecting that and was happily surprised. It is exactly the kind that I was looking for it. I am really happy with it. It is a very good product and is a great Christmas and birthday gift. Recommend it highly.",

                "reviewText": "This is the fourth camera purchased from this manufacturer.The good:1. Installation is straightforward. Download the app, connect the device to Wi-Fi, position the camera for best viewing, and you are done.2. The app (free) is pretty much bug free and works well on Apple products. I don\u2019t have any direct experience with other platforms.3. Image clarity is very good as is color rendition.4. Nigh vision mode is surprisingly good. Of course, its range is limited to about 40 feet or so.5. You can use the app without monthly charges. If more functionality is desired plans are available to greatly increase the productivity of the devices.6. The devices can be shared with other users.7. All my devices were hardwired but I helped a friend install a solar unit and they are happy with its performance.The not so good:1. An app is required to access the devices. To the best of my knowledge there is no website where these images can be accessed. This makes it unavailable for smart homes.2. The mounting hardware has gotten less robust over time. The devices were ordered over a space of a year or so. Picture quality is still very good, but the mounting hardware not longer includes the easily adjustable magnetic mounts. What is supplied is sufficient, but just barely so. The device uses a standard \u00bc-20 screw so fabricating a mount would not be difficult.",

The one thing that really gets me though is manufacturers who want to get you to sign up for a monthly plan to get full functionality. Im not talking about data storage. If I paid for a product I EXPECT FULL FUNCTIONALITY STRAIGHT OUT OF THE BOX!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. First bought 2 cameras in Dec 2022. Also purchased 2 solar panels separately. Charged the cameras, then installed the VicoHome app on my tablet. Got the cameras paired with the app - no problems. Initially, I purchased the cameras to watch the stray cats coming around. Live in a rural area and had also have coyotes to deal with. I had placed the cameras in a variety of locations, before deciding I needed 2 more. Purchased 2 more a month later.The cameras are located:1. Cat's room. I have a male TNR (Trap,Neuter,Release) that appeared 5 yrs ago. He has tried to kill my female (she appeared 10 yrs ago), so he is kept in his own room and let out, via window, every afternoon, when I bring the female in. I've watched a few stray cats that appeared 7 months ago, enter his room, eat his food, lay on the bed - mostly at night. Yet the videos are clear as day. Camera running on battery. Charge lasts several months. (Honestly have only plugged it in twice since purchase) 2. Under the house. I have a food and water dish under the house for the strays, protected them in the winter from the cold. Dark under there. The camera works just fine. Can see which cat shows up when. Also helped to spot a water pipe breakage. Camera plugged in to outlet that's also under the house.3. Chicken pen. Got more chicks and noticed that area was a traffic run for the coyotes. Will watch the footage to gauge when the coyotes show up. Camera hooked up to a small solar panel. Retains full charge constantly.4. On flatbed trailer. Placed at the opposite end of the property (300 yards from house/wifi). To watch for coyotes or other animal visitors (caught neighbor's dog on it the other day). Has provided awesome sunset shots. Had a massive storm recently - watched the nickel sized hail bounce off the ground. Camera unscathed. Camera hooked up to a small solar panel. Retains full charge constantly.-I don't have any of the cameras mounted. Though will do the chicken pen camera as the weeds are growing to obscure its line of sight. The cameras outside have weathered snow, wind, hail, rain, and heat. Still performing wonderfully.- I personally love the picture quality. Daylight scenes, obviously, show more detail and distance. Nighttime is still quite clear, though the distance is reduced. Unless rain or dirt covers the lens. Has happened. Wipe off and good to go.- Motion detection is usually good though can be wanting. Have watched Romeo come into the bedroom from the window but never seen him leave. I've walked in the cat's bedroom and it's recorded me at the far end and leaving but not walking in. Has happened a few times but is generally great at motion capture. Hence 4 of 5 stars.- The sound is exceptionally clear and loud. The two-way sound works great. I've spoken my husband through one and could hear him clearly responding back.- I didn't pay for the subscription - I just use the free service with the VicoHome. I get 3 days of 20 secs videos that I can download. They automatically get stored in the Google picture gallery. You set up the videos record segments yourself. Determine the length of the video (20 secs is longest), Motion detection (low, med, high), record in SD or HD, alert notifications (because of the chickens moving constantly, I turned off the notifications. Got one every 20 secs), have light activated or not. There is a button to press for a white light to come on. I used that to see the water leak under the house in better detail.- Each camera is listed by video window on the app. An icon will show you if there are motion detected videos to watch per camera.Not sure what else to say except that I'm purchasing more to place on the house. Had a coyote howl outside the kitchen window last night and haven't seen Romeo or Zoreh since. Hopefully, I'll see them on the camera under the house tonight or tomorrow.Videos/photo: 1. Coyote at chicken pen 2. BrightEyes and Zoreh under the house 3. Outside daylight from flatbed trailer.",

The app is awesome and very easy to use and share with other family members. The image quality is also very good, I like that you can zoom in and also turn a light on if it's dark and you can't see very well. You can talk to people through the camera and also sound an alarm all from your app. Another helpful feature is that you can turn your notifications on and off or set them on a timer. I highly recommend this camera, so much better than those silly door bell cameras everyone has. Worth everyone penny!",
