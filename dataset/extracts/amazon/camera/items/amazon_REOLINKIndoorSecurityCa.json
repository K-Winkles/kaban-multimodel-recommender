                "reviewText": "I recently purchased three Reolink E1 Pro monitors to keep an eye on a family member who recently had some health issues. I am extremely impressed, satisfied and so happy that I selected this product. The product arrived in perfect shape. The setup of each monitor was extremely easy. The phone app was easy to find and install on my Android phone. Voice prompts from the monitor and also the app guided me through the whole process quickly and easily. Setup was a breeze and had me monitoring in just a few minutes.. The phone app is very easy to use, which is another huge asset in using this product. I set up one monitor in the living room, kitchen-dining room area, and bedroom. I can view each room separately or I can monitor all three rooms at once. Monitoring during daytime or evening is easy due to the great resolution of the monitor. I can also turn on the sound and hear all communication going on in a room. The Reolink monitor also allows me to return communication (two-way). There have been a few instances where my family member has said my communication was a bit garbled, but that may be due to user error on my part by being too close to my phone when speaking. Most times communication from my end is heard well. There is a second or 2 delay in receiving my voice communication but I am heard and can hear the family member extremely well. Also the monitor has amazing room surveillance coverage in that I am able to remotely move the monitor so that I can see all parts of a room from ceiling to floor and left to right. Technology is amazing!!! This product has given me a sense of well-being when I can't be with my family member in person. It also has given my family member a sense of safety and well-being in that they dont feel alone. Whether this device would be used for baby monitoring, covid monitoring, the elderly monitoring, security or any other needed reason for monitoring, I highly highly recommend this product. You get a lot of bang for your buck along with a huge sense of relief in being able to oversee any situation clearly without actually being in the room. This is a great product that I highly recommend. I am beyond satisfied with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Note that I already have a Reolink 420 and a C1-Pro (no longer made). I had previously bought the E1 with a single 2.4Ghz frequency which stubbornly refused to connect with the iPhone Reolink app. I have an XFinity Arris dual frequency cable modem router where the 2 frequencies are bound to the same name, rather than with separate names as is more usual.After much communication with tech support, as well as posting questions, I was persuaded to give the dual frequency E1-Pro a shot.Using the Reolink app on my iPhone, the ca,era could not get any further than the multi-language request to load the app. This was worse than the E1 which at least got to the end of the process but would not connect.However, as I was told that this camera should work, I connected it to an ethernet cable and used the Reolink Windows software to make the connection. This worked. I was then able to configure the WiFi using the WiFi name and password.So far, so good. However, I use iSpy as my software to manage my cameras and motion detection recordings. The latest version did have the E1-Pro listed as installable with the IP camera wizard. No joy. It was clearly not able to detect the camera. However, knowing that the camera used ONVIF, I was able to connect this camera using the ONVIF menu item., and using the camera's name and password that was required by the Reolink Windows app.Bottom line:1. The camera does work and can be connected.2. It would not connect with the Reolink app from the Apple iTunes Appstore3. It did need to be connected using an ethernet cable from the cable modem router and using the Reolink Window software. This required adding a name and p[password (actually good for privacy).Once the WiFi is configured, the ethernet cable can be disconnected and the camera then works via WiFi on the Reolink Windows app.4. If you use iSpy software to manage security cameras, it needs to be installed using the ONVIF menu item when adding a camera, and NOT the IP camera wizard as it cannot detect the camera.This is not a camera to give to a technical novice as it will generate hours of frustration.Once connected, it is a nice camera, with good resolution and like the discontinued C1-Pro, has sound as well as vision. AFAICS, the only improvement over the C1-Pro is that the external antennas are absent giving it a smaller form factor for placement (and, a minor factor, is more esthetically pleasing).",

I can no longer climb my step ladder to see outside so I needed something that I could check and see what was going on. We sometimes get homeless people that come in decide. They're going to try and camp out for the night that's not happening in this alley. I live in a seniors building. So the only other idea was to put a camera in my window. So I knew what was going on when to be concerned and when not to be concerned. Camera works great and I feel a heck of a lot safer. Camera works off of my phone and I can see clearly what I'm aiming at. And that's day or night. It doesn't matter. Can still see clearly. This camera is worth the money and it wasn't easy setup. It's just a matter of matching it to my phone which is an Android and to my Wi-Fi. It worked out great. It was set up no matter of a about 15 minutes.",
