Also hard to get from the photo just taken, checking it, and going back to take another picture. The date doesn't stay either. If you want a date you have to change it all the time. The selfie aspect of it works well but it's hard to find/hold the snap button. Kind of awkward. At least my fingers don't cover the lens as it does on my much more expensive camera. It does have a tripod attachment port on the bottom. There are a few quirks to this little camera, but I think as I get used to it it'll be ok. Good little starter camera.",

The camera's ease of use makes it a great entry point for new photographers, while the wide-angle lens invites experimentation with different types of shots. Its ability to function as a webcam adds versatility, particularly for those who frequently switch between photography and video calls. The smaller sensor size does mean it might not perform as well in low light, but for most situations, it offers great value. It's a camera that won't intimidate beginners and has enough features to explore as you grow.",

                "reviewText": "This camera stands out with a unique color, precisely the one I've always wanted to highlight my personality. It has a moderate weight, providing a sense of quality when held, yet it is not heavy. With a strap design, it's very convenient for me to carry when going out, either in hand or around my neck. The camera is made of good material; I easily get sweaty hands, but there's no sign of slipping when holding it. The battery life is sufficient, and the camera is quite power-efficient, allowing me to use it throughout an entire day. It possesses both photography and video recording functions, producing very clear results. It's an excellent choice for beginners in photography.",

                "reviewText": "We got this to use when traveling because my brother recently had someone try and steal his phone while taking pictures on trip. I looked around and liked this one because it is very compact, so does not take up extra room in my bag. The high MP and zoom were important to me so I could get clear detailed pictures for printing, if necessary. I have tried out most of the features and am very pleased with my choice. The menu is easy to navigate and configure everything, and the buttons are responsive. The screen is clear and make it easy to review photos so you can only keep those you want without filling up the SD card with junk pics. I tried out the video option and it looks smooth and clear, but probably won't be using that much myself, I mainly want photos. I am really looking forward to our trip this year and will certainly get lots of use from this camera.",
