I was so impressed with the Littlelf software flexibility and the performance and ease of setup of the Litokam that a few days later, I purchased an exterior M1 Litokam. Even though I already have a DVR with a fixed 5 camera system, it's false alerts and lack of PTZ left a lot to be desired. I think 3 of these cameras would far exceed the performance of my far more expensive fixed camera DVR system.",

The spotlight and siren deter unwanted visitors, though I haven't had to use the siren yet.The two-way audio lets me chat with delivery guys or scare off critters, which I have used before. It's weatherproof which is nice.",

The idea of getting another camera that worked with the Tuya Smart app I already have on every phone/tablet was exciting!Setup was shockingly easy.I plugged in the only cable from the camera, USB power. There are no audio or network connections at all, or visible wifi antenna.The camera started beeping slowly, and blinking a light.I went into Tuya Smart app, and select add device, Camera, WiFi Camera.It confirmed the camera is ready, then provided a QR code to \"show\" to the camera.The camera immediately responded, and a couple seconds later it was working, WOW!It also works with Alexa. On an Echo Show I can say \"Alexa Show Side View\", and it shows the camera I named \"Side View\".One very annoying flaw is there is no Tuya Smart app for Windows, so I have to use my phone to view the video unless I use an Android emulator for Windows (slow).",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The initial setup is nice and easy, which surprised me actually. Time has moved on a lot! This camera is fully functional, even without subscribing to cloud services.Apart from being available to look through on demand via the internet, this camera will send out alerts when it detects motion and or sound. Each of those two functions can be independently controlled in the scheduling system. For me, I wanted both sound and motion alerts to be sent to my phone after working hours when the workshop is closed. The time scheduler on this is simple enough, select the days you want (Mon, Tues, Wed, etc) I clicked all of them. Then select a time to start from. Set a second schedule to switch off the detection settings. So if you want the motion detection settings on over the weekends, just leave Saturday and Sunday off the 'switching-off' schedule.It is important to take the time to set up the schedules if motion and sound detection are to be used successfully. There is also a detection sensitivity setting. It does send notifications as soon as the detection happens, so if it's set up incorrectly and motion detection is left on all day, it will ping messages all day!The camera has some advanced functions too, like motion tracking where it literally turns to look at whatever is moving. It can also be set for Human Detection, Siren trigger, siren duration, and volume. There are a few more tricks, but that's more than enough for my needs.I'm impressed. I like it. Five Full Stars!",

Secondly you can opt for SD storage; useful in some situations but as this is a CCTV/Wi-Fi camera, it\u2019s easy enough for a thief to take it.The app does allow for notifications to be sent to your phone if movement is detected but these can be turned off if you don\u2019t want them.Connects to my VM router without issue as it has 2.4Ghz connectivity.Just for the curious out there, this is a PTZ camera so can be tilted, panned and zoomed(digital)The product description leaves you completely in the dark on this camera and all its specs so it was a bit of a pleasant surprise when it all worked fine, is a decent quality camera and has so many features.",

Control is via the Littlelf Smart app (there's a QR code in the box) and allows you to watch live, and as its a PTZ camera you can move the view to see more of where you are monitoring. It has infrared leads too, so you can see in the dark.One cool feature is the follow function which detects movement and then keeps the target in view. It works OK, but only slow moving large objects, it didn't detect my cat at all. It has 2 way audio, so if you saw your pet doing something they shouldn't you can tell them the stop it.For the price, it's a pretty decent camera, just don't expect it to be a professional grade security device",
