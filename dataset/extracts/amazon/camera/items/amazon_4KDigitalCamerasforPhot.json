                "reviewText": "My husband and I recently started a YouTube channel to record us cooking in the kitchen together. I could have used my phone for recording, but I wanted something a little bit more permanent that I could leave on the tripod for extended periods of time without needing to mount and unmount it frequently. We love to cook on camera and it has been a ton of fun with this one! The macro ability and quality of the shot is really impressive when we are looking at our output videos. Battery life is no slouch either.In terms of autofocus, we have had no issues at all with this camera. Whether we are pointing it at food, have our faces coming in and out of the frame, or are just panning over ingredients, everything stays well enough focused and we don\u2019t have to fiddle with any settings. For those of us who just want to focus on cooking and our actual content instead of camera settings, this is a real winner \u2014 it\u2019s fire and forget! For the price, would definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Although it's not an advanced camera, it's affordable and offers good quality for its price. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive digital camera. I'm new to the vlogging world,buying a camera so it was a little complicated setting everything up but once I did it, I can't believe how amazing the quality of the pictures are.I don't want to spend lots of time on my first vlogging camera but I have to say this product is far beyond my expectation.This Camera is just awesome,The clarity of the pics is amazing I am satisfied with my choice It's handy and comfortable to carry anywhere You can charge it and use it.Not waterproof so need to be cautious,also it gets hot after using for a long time ,so take small breaks.",

                "reviewText": "Really fun entry level camera for vlogging. The pink color really pops and looks great on my desk. I use the macro lens often for closeups so it\u2019s great that it\u2019s included in the package. Video quality is what you would expect for a camera in this price range \u2014 it\u2019s definitely good especially if you tweak the settings but nothing mind blowing. The live streaming to the phone is a really cool feature and makes it SO easy to set up shots when you have the camera on a tripod! I wish every camera had that feature. The screen flipping out 180 degrees is nice too when trying to take selfie video. Definitely worth the price of admission.",

                "reviewText": "This one is a no from me. The G-Anica digital camera I received looks nothing like the picture here, and every but like the cheap piece of junk it is. Its sensor is smaller than the one on my flip phone from 2002, and the pictures it takes look about as good.The only benefit here is that the camera is very inexpensive, so if you're looking for a very cheap way to take some crappy photos, I guess this is a good option. Woof.",
