                "reviewText": "I had been shooting with a Sony RX 100 but people kept dropping it including myself and there goes $1200. So I decided I needed a camera that was built to be unbreakable and in addition waterproof this Kodak camera has blown me away at how simple it is yet the image quality is fantastic, it looks as good as cameras five times its price. The flash by the way is better than my old Sony The menu is simple enough that I did not even have to consult the instructions, so yes I would totally recommend this camera.",

It does chew through its rechargable batteries. I carried 3 to make it through a heavy picture touristy day in Chile. At randome times a picture will be totally bright white or be out of focus...but who cares, its digital, just take it again; only problem is the out of focus ones, because with the small display, it is hard to know for sure if it is out of focus, so I usually take several pictures of the same thing. The panorama mode is cool, but you have to learn to \"time the slide\" to get the picture to turn out right.",

Even though the resolution is high, the image quality is profoundly poor. Not sure if there were different versions produced with different sensors that account for positive reviews, or how this would satisfy a need for any other customer.I missed the return window for this and will be giving it away.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I like how small and lightweight this camera is, and it does produce fairly good pictures and video, along with decent audio.Unfortunately I quickly realized that this camera is better suited for snorkeling than SCUBA. I took it on my most recent trip to Playa De Carmen, and used it on roughly 8 dives. Each time when I reached about 32'/10m depth the buttons no longer depress.Most of my dives averaged about 38', and so I had to squeeze with a mighty force to activate the camera. Even when I could get it to begin video, often the video would stop because the pressure caused the button to depress multiple times.Long story short, if you snorkel or take pictures in the pool, this camera is great, but if infesting in something for SCUBA, this will be a pass. Which is sad because it's one of the more affordable underwater cameras.",
