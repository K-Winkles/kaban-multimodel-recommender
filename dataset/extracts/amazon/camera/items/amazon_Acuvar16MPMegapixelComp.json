He takes one picture and it shuts off. He picked it up today and the batteries weren\u2019t working as always so we tried to switch them out. Well guess what the battery got stuck in there. Can\u2019t get the battery out and the Metal Piece for the battery holder now has broke. It\u2019s a piece of junk your have one disappointment kid of adult if you buy this thing!",

It is smaller than other ones cameras I have had, this one is made out of plastic and is very light. It does not come with a SD card or batteries (3 AAA) so that is an extra cost. Be careful when adding the batteries, the hinge to the compartment came loose on mime. I was able to attach it back! It connected to my laptop using the USB cable and it acts just to a flash drive. Overall I think the price is more in line with \u201ckids\u201d cameras that cost $19-$25. It does a decent job for the price.",
