Coming from the Canon Rebel T2i I had been using for the past 7 years, this was a monumental upgrade. Lots of options for differently placed focus points and awesome AI-Servo continuous focus mode. My only gripe is that it's a bit noisy in low light situations, but that's to be expected to an extent from a crop sensor camera, and it's not intolerable. If given the choice again on which camera to pick for my upgrade, I'd choose this again in a heartbeat.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first major upgrade from an entry level dslr and it gets done everything I currently need done. The dual card slots is huge for paid work so I can write to both cards and have an in-body backup. Shoots fast, is sturdy and can take a little abuse. It does take some schooling and research to run this thing at its full potential, but you're going to get that with anything beyond the Rebel series.",

Took the camera to Canon and had a 500.00 repair because inner workings were corroded due to old water damage. Very disappointing. Next time I'll just buy a new camera. Lesson learned.",
