There is nothing like grabbing an \"actual\" camera to snap those memories. It is simple to upload them to a computer or run down to the drugstore to get them printed (which I prefer). The metallic purple is my favorite color and the one I purchased. SIM card and ready to roll, or click, so I can hear the shutter and save those moments.",
