It features up to 20x digital zoom, allowing you to capture even the tiniest things with ease. Supports SD flash memory cards up to 128 GB, allowing you to save more photos without worrying about storage save issues.In addition, face detection is a great feature that helps kids use this digital camera more easily while the built-in flash keeps photos bright enough while taking them.The camera is perfectly sized and lightweight, making it ideal for a child's hand.I would say this is a simple digital camera that has all the basic features in it and is suitable for beginners in child photography as well.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this camera to put it in the car. If there is a vehicle collision on the road, sometimes when the mobile phone camera cannot meet the needs, it can be used for on-site photo recording. For this need, the camera should not be too big, the smaller the better, so that it is easy to carry. This camera lens meets 1080P video or 56MP photos, which is already a pretty good configuration. Although it is small in size, it has configurations for functions such as anti-shake, time-lapse, and continuous shoot. It's a pocket-sized camera, but it fully meets all your daily shooting needs. Coupled with a very competitive price, it is a cost-effective product.",
