                "reviewText": "I bought the COOAU D20S dash cam for my new car to replace the Veckle mini 0906 I had in the old car. I am very happy with my new COOAU D20S, there are a number of features that the previous one did not have; First of all, it has wifi, I can connect the camera to my Android phone with an application that is offered with the camera to view or download the videos on my phone, although I am not completely familiar with the app yet, I notice that at the same time I watch the video on my phone, a map shows me the location and route of the video which is very helpful.On the front, it has a 170-degree front view camera with 1440P resolution that captures everything in detail. The rear camera facing the inside of the car (I think it has 150 degrees of rear view), gives me a great view of the inside and rear outside of the car, and has built-in infrared lights for nighttime use, but I noticed that even without the infrared lights, I still get videos with great detail.I have the camera connected with the supplied cable to the cigarette lighter, when I turn off my car, (Nissan Kicks), after 4 or 5 minutes, the camera disconnects, exactly what I want. I just want to mention that because the cable is not too thick, it is easy to conceal.There's nothing I don't like about the camera, I even used the suction mount cup to attach it to the windshield to hold it up temporarily and then use the adhesive bracket, but to my surprise, it's still held very securely.I know the camera and the app has many other features that I haven't explored yet, so I cannot comment on it; I will get there.I found the price reasonable for what I bought and I will definitely recommend this camera to you if you are thinking of purchasing one.",

                "reviewText": "Excellent unit. Instructions are detailed and overall well written but there are many gaps that can cause confusion. A few improvements are needed. I am still in the process of reviewing these however some are below.The instructions on how to navigate the app should be clearer: For example, how do you get to the \u201cEmergency\" files - those that indicate that your vehicle was in an accident or hit while parked and unattended! Through the app or through the unit itself - or both? Not too clear.It should have been stated on the FIRST page that the app necessary to be downloaded is FICAM. This information is not found until the END of the manual on page 34 - in parentheses!! (The manual is 37 pages.) A separate black \u201cTips\u201d card is included in the box, which mentions the app but it doesn\u2019t give the NAME of the app! It should also be made clear the the unit can be controlled entirely from the app itself. In fact, the unit can ONLY be controlled by the app WHILE it is connected to at the app. The cam cannot be controlled manually and will alert you of this. If the app is downloaded right away, the entire setup can be done from your phone. This makes life MUCH easier (especially if you have big hands!)I also think the COOAU could include an electrostatic mounting film for the adhesive mount. This would make it much easier to remove from the glass when or if the vehicle is sold or turned in from lease.A minor detail: A micro disc is needed for this camera. It is NOT included. It MUST be formatted before installation. (The manual states this.) If the purchaser does not have a card reader, it must be purchased beforehand in order to format the card. Not a big expense - around $15 - but this information should be provided.The manual could be clearer but the dash cam itself is excellent. Took off one star for the lack of clarity.",

This a high quality dash cam that is equal to other dash cams that cost much more.One more thing: the suction cup mount is really solid. I've had other dash cams that I used with suction cup mounts but it was flimsy. The Cooau mount is very well designed and has very strong suction.",
