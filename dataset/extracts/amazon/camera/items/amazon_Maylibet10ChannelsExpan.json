Installation and setup went very smoothly, I did it all by myself. Slolar power and WiFi connection so no wiring required. The cameras work great, and the picture/sound quality is amazing\uff08clear images even at night and it really detects humans\uff09It alerts our phones and tablets via the app, when there is movement around the house 24/7.I wish the screen was a touch screen, but the included mouse works fine. Having the ability to plug in a separate HDMI monitor that is much bigger is great as well.The system work perfect so far!",

                "reviewText": "Setup: a little bit tricky as you need a monitor. There are two versions of this product. I got the cheaper one which doesn't have a built-in monitor. At least, I didn't figure out how to connect to the app without a monitor. You need a monitor and hdmi cable then use the mouth (included) to set it up. The entire setup is very straightforward with a monitor.Night vision/motion detection: it's acceptable. For example, can capture two mice chasing around at night in my job site.Biggest plus: I can use the app to move the cams so it provides much larger coverage.",

The quality of the video, very high-definition detail. You can also download a App through dialogue and then install it. It is very simple and easy. As long as you have Wi-Fi, it will be no problem. I also tried to use my mobile phone to remotely control this security camera. I haven't installed it in my backyard yet. because the weather here is relatively cold. I will install it when the weather warms up. This one is really useful. I highly recommend it to friends who need it. Thank you.",

I find it updates very quickly and the camera/picture quality is very good, in my opinion the camera is better than that one. I love the wide view as it can see the front of my house as well as the street/neighbors across the street/etc. If you need a high quality camera at a more affordable price, I recommend this one. I also like that it is solar powered so no images of it mounted on the house but it works great",
