The motion tracking is exceptionally good (way better than I expected), the image is clear, and the video stable. I'm using a t-mobile prepaid SIM and at $10 for their 2gb plan, it's pretty affordable per camera. Set up was no muss no fuss - literally just popped a SIM and SD card in it, used the app to add it, and it was up and running. It hasn't fallen below 90% charge yet, even at night, and the build quality itself is pretty stout with the camera having a metal body. I do wish the mount for the camera itself wasn't plastic, but I've got it secured to a tree with some decking screws, so I don't anticipate anything being able to get to it.It's so good thus far, that I just ordered another one. I'll come back and update this review if anything changes for better or worse.",

                "reviewText": "I have been through many different brands, trying to get the best cellular camera for my jobsites. I bought my last cell camera a week ago, it did not work with an AT&T Sim Card. I called ATT once and went to their store three times trying to get it to work. It advertised that it would work with multiple sim cards, but it only worked with the one provided. I put the same sim card in this camera and it worked instantly! Everything you would want in a cellular camera, this does. You can use it on your phone and laptop, it has 2 different camera lenses at the same time.. one that is wide and another that is zoom, remote use of: spotlight, siren, move camera up, down, left, right, will record on an SD card (that you have to buy separately), or their cloud service (which I did not purchase). It was well worth the money! I have had it up for 24 hours, I will update if it does not hold up.",

Eventually (this took several hours), AT&T was able to provide a pre-paid SIM card. On the camera, the SIM cover plate screws are soft and easily stripped. I had to go to great lengths (using two different screwdrivers and pliers) to remove it. Once a SIM card was inserted, the camera would not activate. It told me to reinsert the SIM. I tried to do that but could not get the SIM card to eject. I took it to AT&T and they could not get it out either. When I called Reolink technical support (3 times), they did not pick up the phone and only provided an automated answer stating that they were unavailable to take my call.The email support was very good and I was able to communicate with them as needed to address the problems.Update: I received a full refund for this product but the pre-paid card money is lost.",

                "reviewText": "I bought one just to work with my Go PT around my property and so far I am impressed. I would say it is a huge upgrade. I actually bought 2 of them. Partially to retire the Go PT which I will get in to a little bit in the cons. If I can get it to work, the Go PT will live another day. Assuming Freedompop will work again... Go with EIOT Club for the SIM card. It will work immediately.Pros: Metal housing is a huge bonus. Dual lens is pretty awesome. Active tracking is pretty neat too. Will have to play around with settings. The best thing I have found so far is the pre set views. Rather than pan and tilt to a point which takes time, set it once and it's like speed dial. It goes to those points really quick.Cons: Though the panel to access the power switch has captive screws, the SD card panel is not. I guarantee you I will lose those screws at some point. The antennas are built in. This is one of the reasons I am retiring the Go PT. Though that antenna can be replaced, it literally crumbled after being exposed to the Florida sun for a year and a half. That is my biggest concern.I am really excited to see this camera in action for security, hog damage monitoring, and time lapses during hurricanes.",
