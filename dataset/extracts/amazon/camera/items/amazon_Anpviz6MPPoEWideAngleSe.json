Build quality is also excellent - the housing is metal and the mounting plate is well designed. Downside is that the unit is considerably bigger than the other single-lens turret cameras that I own. The mounting footprint is larger and it extends from the mounting surface farther. Included a photo with a lemon for scale.Setup with my NVR was pretty straightforward. The instructions were pretty clear about how to initialize the camera, and after setup my NVR connected through ONVIF.",

                "reviewText": "The quality of the camera is very good, and the digital stitching works pretty well to give you one large image from the two cameras. This camera has a starlight sensor so it handles color night vision pretty well if there is a small light source. Unfortunately this camera only has IR LEDs, and forcing it to not switch to black and white mode is a bit cumbersome using its configuration options. The best you can really do is to manually schedule it so it only switches to black and white IR night vision for only 10 seconds at a specified time. Given how good the color night vision is when placed in an area where white lights already exist, if only it came with the option for enabling regular white LEDs instead if IR it would be much better.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: This negates all the good that I previously wrote about this camera. I had it set up to record to the SD card I installed. It had been correctly formatted through the app and appeared to be working fine. I only realized when I tried to view the footage that THE CAMERA HAS RECORDED NOTHING. Whatever format it made the SD card, it is unreadable by anything, including its own app. Tried from mobile and PC. The whole point of a camera like this is to be able to view the footage. So disappointed that when I really needed the footage, it was not there. Returning this.This camera is AMAZING. The field of view is something I didn't even think was possible. It covers the entire front of my property left to right and top to bottom. Not to mention that the picture quality is impeccable. I did have some issues with the set up and getting motion detection to work, but the seller was extremely responsive and helped me solve all of those issues. I am as pleased as can be with this camera and actually took my other cameras down because they were no longer needed.",

The resolution is also higher vertically. Horizontal FOV is the same, obv. Framerate is quite low.The mount is amazing the the all-metal construction seems like it will last a very long time, a stark contrast with the Duo2 which is all plastic.RTSP connection is flawless and it has many settings for stream compression allowing to adapt to any NVR.Starlight sensor is very sensitive despite the low power IR LED, this gives a longer range than the Duo 2Image quality is not that great with a lot of bleeding but there is WDR so you will get the information.Sound quality is terrible stock so you have to change it to AAC and turn off ambient filter.This is by far the best 180 camera I have tested and I think this will last as long as the RLC 410.",
