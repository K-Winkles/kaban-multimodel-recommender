Sure it doesn't have the AF capabilities as the 5D models or some of the newer APS-C cameras. But if you know how to focus, this isn't a problem. The image quality is right on par with other full frames (this is ultimately dependent upon the lenses you're using). The average person won't need the features found in the 5D models or 1DX models, but the full frame sensor does make a difference when moving from an APS-C (IQ improves and you can work in lower light situations)...The camera is very easy to use and the menus are very easy to navigate. The one thing that I love is that it doesn't weigh a lot. So it makes travel easier.",
