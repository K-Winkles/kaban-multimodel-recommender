                "reviewText": "Alright, so I'm a tech guy, love anything electronic! I have had CCTV cameras in my house for years. I've been using Swann wired cameras for the most part with mixed emotions. But running new wires to upgrade the system just didn't excite me.I had been looking at NEST cams since I have the smart Thermostats and Smoke/Carbon-monoxide detectors for a while, but the price is ridiculous! Plus your only option with them is cloud service (an additional cost). Then I spoke with a neighbor who sent me a screen shot from his YI camera. I must say, the quality was pretty impressive.So I bought a four pack for $119.00 with moderate expectations. Let me tell you I'm super impressed with the picture quality of these cameras. Set up is quick and easy. When I purchased them I had no idea they had audio as well. The audio quality is incredible, plus it's a two way speaker. Purchased 32 GB SD cards for all of them so I didn't need to use cloud storage and it's been working great! I have them set to record all motion and I usually have about 7 days of history on each camera.Day and night vision are both spectacular IMO. I have attached several photos so you can see the quality both day and night. Side note, I have a couple \"indoor cams\" mounted outside. To do this I purchased a rubber sleeve/cover from Amazon to make the drop cam weather resistant for outdoor application. It's been through rain, sleet and snow with out issue so far. Link to cover: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FD5XHMP/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1A couple cons, the power cable is sooooooo short. I had to purchased longer cables for a couple of my installs. No biggie, they are only a few dollars here on Amazon. The app for iOS is very functional, but it has no multi camera view which would be a nice option.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars These Little Guys Do the Job!",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I have purchased dozens of security cams over the years and FINALLY, someone got it right. These little guys do the job and for the money it's a no-brainer. I have purchased over 15 of these cameras for 3 different properties. I also use \"Frienda Wall Mount Bracket\" for outdoor use with direct rain exposure with no failures. I have several mounted outside under the eave of the roof so that it does not get rained on and they work great with no housing whatsoever. I also use the Fuji 32GB card so that I have full playback surrounding any alert (or can record continuously). The app is very intuitive and easy to review the highlights.In the attached video from house we have on the market, this scumbag actually broke in and stole all 5 cameras (1 inside and 4 outside), so I did not have access to the detailed footage. However, this is the 6 second clip from the alert, which is the free cloud service that comes with the camera. Given the price of the cameras, it was very inexpensive to replace them all and I have. This time, with the 24x7 cloud service so that the video is preserved even if the cameras are taken.The video quality of the alert is not HD, but the live view and the recorded view on the card is full HD. Also, the sound is surprisingly clear for such an inexpensive camera. Some of the units are better than others and there is some interference in the sound on some of them. But generally pretty good. The night vision is pretty good considering the price point. The motion detection is my only complaint. I get a lot of false alarms for even a small bug flying by, even with sensitivity set at the lowest level. But this is manageable. The sound detection is not much use to me since I have no crying babies in my application. It would be nice if they had an option for other sound detection.The installation is quick and easy and I have installed on several configurations of wifi and routers without a problem. The app is better than any I have worked with in the past. This is a big deal. If it is cumbersome or time consuming to look at the footage, then you won't do it. The way they implemented the app is very intuitive and easy to navigate. I also have the app installed on my Mac andFinally, I give Yi high marks for the business model. A lot of companies try to gouge you on the cloud service by providing an inferior non-cloud service. Yi gives you a choice. You get a free \"alert only for 7 day look-back\" at no charge. So you don't even need a memory card for this. If you want to upgrade to a cloud service, they have a lot of options so you can pick what you want at a reasonable price. Or, you can use the card solution with up to 32GB capacity, which, depending motion settings and the amount of motion, could last for days or even months. I get about 2 weeks in most of my applications. But, as in the case of my video example, this comes at a risk of losing footage if the scumbag makes off with the cam. But the user has the choice, which is what I like.Bottom line: I HIGHLY recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "Really love these cameras.CAMERA: Very good frame, you can choose HD quality and has a great night vision. Charging cord is long enough to set up camera high and get the biggest frame possible.SET UP: was easy : connect to your regular wifi (not 5G), scan the QR code to download the app (YiHome), plug in the camera, you\u2019ll see the connection on the app.FREE/PAY : The free version lets you see the camera in live, so you can see the frame in the present moment but not record. To record and have access to footage you have to pay a monthly or yearly fee. There are 4options to choose from ($CAD per year) : entry 53$ (1camera, 7day history, records activity only), CVR 109$ (1camera, 7day history, always records), standard 135$ (5cameras, 15days history, records activity and AI detection), plus 175$ (5cameras, 30day history, records activity and AI detection).I tried standard but the \u2018activity only recording\u2019 never recorded video movement from my cats or my dad in the frame, it only recorded audio activity like talking. I then switched to CVR which worked perfectly, all the time recording and access to the footage, but you can\u2019t choose to have access to the footage longer than 7days and have to buy the monthly or yearly fee for every camera you want the recording on, which can become pricey.TRAVEL: I bought these for travelling and it worked amazing, not one issue and I was 13h flight away, so i guess it works anytime anywhere.NOTIFS: you can choose to have notifications on or off for when activity is detected by the camera. There is an \u2018absent mode\u2019 which should not alert you of activity if you\u2019re home but it didn\u2019t work for me so I would turn off notifs when I\u2019m home.OVERALL I recommend cause it\u2019s a great camera and worked perfectly for my 2week trip cause I paid for 1month 2 cameras and can use it as live footage from now on. However for a 24h surveillance security system working in my entire home for an entire year I would find it too pricey overtime to pay the fee for each camera and too bothering to have to switch off notifications every time I\u2019m home.",
