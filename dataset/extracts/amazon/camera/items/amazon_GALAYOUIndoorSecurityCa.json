                "reviewText": "I got this indoor cameras for my baby to put in her bedroom & Living room and it works flawlessly. The camera has night vision and motion detection which work great. It gives a good clear 4K quality picture. It\u2019s easy to set up and worth the price. I am very happy with all of my Galayou G2 security cameras and plan to buy more of these indoor cameras to place throughout the house. Built very well. This would make an excellent gift. I highly recommend this and all Wansview products.",

                "reviewText": "Sort story: It is definitely worth the money. I purchased a set of two with the idea to use them with Agent DVR (iSpy) and it did not disappoint.Long story. Camera comes and expected to be used with the companion mobile app. At least all the initial setup (connecting camera to WIFI, enabling ONVIF) is done using mobile app. Setup was quick and easy. Camera supports RTSP, ONVIF (ONVIF needs to be enabled in the mobile app, along with the local account setup) and Agent DVR recognized ONVIF camera without a problem. I did not test it with Blue Iris, but I don't expect it to have problems. However, PTZ controls only work in the companion mobile app and and DO NOT work in Agent DVR. Customer service did confirm this to be the case. I think it's unfair to deduct any stars for this since it was never advertised that PTZ would work in 3rd party DVR apps. Video viewing and recording works in Agent DVR just fine. After all the initial setup was done I disabled internet access for camera on the router and it continues working OK locally for video viewing and recording within Agent DVR. My cameras are positioned mostly statically and if I need to use PTZ I would have to connect it back to internet, use mobile app to change the angle, disable internet and so on. Not ideal, but works for me.Overall video quality and feature set is quite impressive for a sub $20 camera.I have to specifically mention customer support. They actually respond to emails and then follow up to see if I had any other questions/problems. Joy from the customer support was especially helpful. Thank you.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased these GALAYOU Indoor Home Security Cameras - 2K WiFi Surveillance Camera with Two-Way Audio Wi-Fi cameras, and it met all expectations. The setup process was like a breeze. The video quality at 2k is excellent providing a clear picture that captures everything within the frame.The talk mode, complete with a microphone and speaker, adds a whole new dimension to these cameras. The ability to communicate in real-time and the inclusion of alert options significantly enhance the security features. It's reassuring to know that I can stay connected and respond promptly to any situation.Another notable feature is the option to insert a small SD card. This convenient capability allows for video recording and image storage directly on the device, providing a seamless and accessible way to manage captured footage.For in-home use and security, these cameras are a perfect choice. The built-in microphone allows for two-way communication, and the alarm feature adds an extra layer of protection. The price point was more than reasonable, and the fast shipping, coupled with excellent customer service, made the overall buying experience highly satisfactory.",

                "reviewText": "After using the SimpliSafe monitoring system in my home for years, I decided to take a chance on Amazon-purchased cameras for the first time. I was mainly in the market for a couple of cameras to be able to \"keep an eye\" on an elderly person. When I started my search on Amazon, these cameras were among the first to populate. After reading a few positive and negative reviews, I decided to pull the trigger and purchase them. They have turned out to be a great investment so far. Here are some of the pros and cons I noticed so far.Packaging and Installation:The box they came in is sturdy and neatly organized. The cameras are straightforward to install, and the instructions are simple. It is unlikely to have any issues assembling these, even if you have little to no experience setting up cameras or with technology in general.Functionality and Performance:The cameras work splendidly when there is plenty of day or artificial light. The view is, for the most part, crisp and well-defined. Likewise, the picture quality with the night vision is decent. However, if the cameras are too close to a light source when the room is dark, they will likely reflect the circuit board where the lens is mounted. This isn't a huge deal as you can still see clearly most things around it. However, it is somewhat annoying. Although, now and then, it takes a while for it to respond, I like the feature that allows you to rotate the position of the lens 360 degrees right from your phone. This feature mimics that of a joystick in a video game controller. It is possible that the lag is due to issues with the internet connection. The devices also allow you to take stills and videos, which are saved directly to your phone. It is worth noting that the company also offers a cloud storage service for an additional fee. They also come with a microphone to communicate through the camera. I love this feature as it allows me to control Alexa remotely to turn on TVs, shut off lights, play music, turn on the news, etc.It would be ideal if the company would develop a way to access these devices through your computer in addition to your phone. But all in all, these cameras are an excellent choice if you are not looking to spend much money on complicated monitoring systems. I recommend it.",
