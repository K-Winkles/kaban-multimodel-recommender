                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars and had a much better idea of what she was doing",
                "reviewText": "I gave this camera to my girlfriend as an anniversary gift. I've never owned a DSLR camera before - heck, my only camera for the past decade has been a cell phone. She had dabbled in SLR film photography prior to this, though, and had a much better idea of what she was doing.My first impression of this camera was more or less \"wow... I can actually take pictures in low light without a flash.\" The ability to actually capture what one sees naturally is a pretty huge deal. This may seem pretty stupid to more experienced photographers, but it was a brave new world to me.The instructions which come with the camera are very clear, and seem definitely written for someone who has never played with a \"real\" camera before. There is not only a good explanation of the mechanical features of the camera (ie, which buttons do what) but also contain a decent crash course on manual photography. They explain the basics - aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and how each of the different settings configure these settings to produce a different quality of image. Starting with zero background information, I was able to develop a decent intuition based on these descriptions and some trial and error (ie - just taking a lot of pictures). Coming from a film background, my girlfriend had the same reaction - \"It's nice to just be able to practice with the camera, get instant feedback, and not have to worry about film.\"One of the complaints I've seen about this camera compared to the slightly more expensive models, is that the single thumb wheel is limiting, and slows down the photography workflow. I sort of disagree - at least for a beginner. First of all, the camera has a number of well placed modifier buttons - so if you set the camera to \"manual aperture\" mode, the thumb wheel will control the aperture by default and use the magic of DSP to set the shutter speed, exposure compensation and ISO. However, if you need to override one of those settings, all you need to do is press the correct modifier button, and the thumb wheel will then control the corresponding setting until the modifier button is released. It works the same way in full manual mode, except then it then turns off all the automatic compensation features as well. I sort of like this mechanic, as each partial-manual mode provides a single dimension of control (for simplicity), but still allows the user to easily and quickly override the other settings if necessary, without turning the mode dial to a different position. I think it is a great mechanic for beginners since it provides a clear and easy to understand distinction between the various shooting modes, while still providing quick access to the rest of the settings. In that sense, I don't see it as a limitation, as much as I see it as a somewhat simpler way to learn the camera while also learning the finer points of photography. However, if you are already an expert, and understand the ins and outs of the Nikon hardware and software, then I could see it being a bit frustrating. I haven't had to play around inside the menus to control basic settings at all though, as some have suggested in other reviews.In terms of build quality, what more can I say which has not already been covered? You definitely are not sacrificing mechanical or ergonomic quality when buying this camera over some of the more expensive ones. It feels solid, but light in the hand. All the buttons have a nice, firm, satisfying snappiness to them with no softness or ambiguity, and they are all placed in a way which makes sense. The action on the lenses feels like butter, and even though they are plastic - they feel sturdy and high quality. From what I understand, one's ability to shoot at low shutter speeds and small aperture is directly related to one's ability to balance and control the weight of the entire kit, so the attention to weight reduction which Nikon has put into this body and the lenses should directly translate to better pictures. Even the Nikon branded bag which comes with the bundle demonstrates an incredible attention to detail, as the interior is completely modular through clever use of velcro dividers, which allows the user to easily move and re-size the various compartments.The photographs themselves are stunning. It's really difficult to put the experience into words. Just the ability to reliably capture and record what one sees opens a whole world of possibilities in terms of shooting. It is liberating in a way. Even if your goal is not to have your photographs published in National Geographic, and you just want to document your vacation for posterity, being able to do so simply and reliably makes casual photography much more enjoyable.In conclusion - this is a great camera for a beginner, and has a ton of room to grow with the user. Sure, there are better sensors out there, and more feature-rich cameras, but for someone who's primary interest is to learn the basics, take fantastic pictures, and develop the hobby beyond what is possible with a point-and-shoot camera, it really seems like this would be difficult to beat in terms of price, quality and performance.",

                "reviewText": "I have to say that I did some research and talked with a friend of mine that is very much into photography. As an entry level model and for what I needed the D3200 had all the features I was looking for. I received this camera and started taking pictures right off, and I was very, very pleased with the results. The Nikor 18-55mm lens is a very good all round lens and takes some very good pictures. I love the action feature on the D3200 and have shot a few nice action pictures. There was no blur, and the pictures were clear and crisp. For the price I paid i was very pleased as well. I looked at several stores and online wen I came across this deal it was too good to pass up. The camera is easy to use and can function as a pint and shoot or use it in the manual mode, either way is just as easy. I will say this, invest in a UV filter for you lens. These filters are only a few dollars and I would highly recommend using one. If you scratch the lens filter you are only out a few dollars, compared to a few hundred dollars for a new lens. Believe me you will nit regret buying one, but you will be crying if you scratch your new lens. The camera itself is light weigh enough as not be bulky and has a great feel. The other thing I have learned about Nikon cameras is that all Nikor lens will fit a Nikon body. While some lens functions may not work with the camera, however this is what the manual functions come into play. So it is possible to get older camera lens in great shape for a lot less money. This was another selling point that I liked about the Nikon over Canon. There are several filters that you can add to the lens like ND, and polarizing filters that will give you nice effects. I really can not say enough about this camera, if you are looking to break into digital photography then this is a really great camera. It has all the features I was looking for and then some. I would recommend shooting in RAW format. This was recommend by my friend who knows digital photography and sells some of his work. I do not remember all the details behind the reason for this but this is quality I shoot in. For someone who use to shoot only film, this was my entry into quality digital photography and I am very impressed with the Nikon D3200. I am a amateur photographer at best and I really wanted to get back into taking pictures. This setup was at a great price point and is a really good rig for the amateur photographer or someone looking to start off in photography and needs a good camera to start off with without spending a arm and a leg. I hope this review will help someone who is thinking about what camera they should buy or someone who may be on the fence about jumping into a digital SLR camera.",

                "reviewText": "Great entry-level camera! (Yes, I know, it's hard to believe that something that costs $500 is considered entry-level). This is was my first DSLR and I love it.Pros:-24.2 megapixels. Takes GREAT quality photos!- compact and light-Great for learning photography.- relatively inexpensive compared to other DSLRsCons:- Not weather sealed. Cannot take pictures in the rain or in a storm (A lot of times that's when I want to shoot!)-small frame can seem a little too small in big hands. When I shoot for a long time I find myself wishing I had more to hold on to and be able to fit my pinky finger on it, but it's not a big deal at all.-Kit lenses are alright for getting started, but are basically the worst and cheapest lenses made by Nikon. If you want more professional looking photographs, You should invest in better lenses (and of course practice! if you can't take good photos with a bad lens then you won't be able to take good photos with a really expensive lens either).Summary: This camera is capable of taking better photos than I am. A bad photo from this camera is user error. It's a great camera to grow into. The pros far outweigh the cons in my opinion. It's really the lenses rather than the camera body that make great images, so I would recommend upgrading from the kit lenses.DO THIS: Buy either a 35mm 1.8, or 50mm 1.8 lens. You will be glad you did. I immediately sold my 55-200 lens and bought a 35mm 1.8 and it was the best thing I ever did. If you want to do portrait photography, I would recommend an 85mm 1.8, if you have some extra $$ to throw. I don't.",
