Purchased this Akaso EK 7000 based on a recommendation from a friend of my wife's, and I just can't believe what this little camera can do for the money we put into it. As a caveat, we're not pushing the camera to the limits of human endurance by skydiving, mountain biking, scuba diving or the like. But it works extremely well for our needs. My wife competes in dog obedience training, and likes to review videos of her dog's performance after trials and matches. Finding someone willing and capable to record her session in the ring on a cellphone is always difficult. Most of the other dog handlers are preoccupied with their dogs, and it's not good ring etiquette to approach too close to the show ring to shoot video, since that will be a distraction. She noticed another handler retrieving a tiny camera from just outside the corner of the ring after her session and asked about it. Turned out to be this little EK 7000, and that handler was very enthusiastic about what it could do. When my wife asked for it for Christmas I was skeptical, so I spent a lot of time researching this and several other cameras. While there were other cameras that were able to do what the Akaso could do, and possibly even more, they were all at least two to three times as expensive. So I went ahead and gave this to my wife for Christmas. We gave it a full practice run-through yesterday, mounting it on a short tripod at the corner of the ring. I used the 1080p 30fps setting instead of the 4K mode to get more storage space and lengthen battery life. Had the camera on for about an hour, shooting about a dozen videos of one to three minutes, plus a number of photos, and with wi-fi on for a while, and off for a while. I tried starting and stopping the camera manually, then used the phone app, and lastly used the remote for a while. All worked well, even from about 20 yards away. Back home I hooked up the camera to our 55-inch TV (via a micro-HDMI cable, not included), and we were both very pleased with the video quality. Since it's a wide-angle lens, people (and dogs) are naturally pretty small at about 15 yards, but the high video quality means that when you put the video on a large screen you can still see all the details. The sound was a little muddy, but a huge overhead furnace was running right over the camera which made audio pickup difficult. The battery lasted for at least two hours with the camera on, and was recording or playing back videos later for most of that time. The little charger will charge two batteries at a time, and seemed to need only an hour to take the battery from fully discharged to fully charged. (Lights on the charger progress from magenta to red to blue while charging.) You can also charge the battery just by connecting a USB cable to the camera, which we did while transferring files to the computer. I used four different video viewers on the our computer to watch the videos, and all showed the clips with no problem. Settled on VLC Media Player to access slow motion and other features. There are so many attachment options included in the box that I can't imagine you won't be able to mount it any where you wanted. I used the frame with bottom and top threaded sockets to mount it to a regular camera tripod, and it worked great. The camera is so tiny that I've taken to putting it back into its waterproof case for additional protection before stowing it in the camera bag. A couple notes: We installed the Akaso DV app on a Samsung Galaxy S5 cellphone. It worked almost perfectly, although at one point I changed modes at the same time I rotated the phone, and that, or some gremlin, locked up the app tight with a black screen. Force-stopped the app and restarted it, and had no further problems. The app itself is great, giving you the ability to start and stop the camera from a distance via a wi-fi connection, (be sure to disconnect the phone from any other wi-fi networks first), and actually see what the camera is recording live. While recording, the camera flashes a little red light on the top of the camera, but it's not visible from anywhere but right above the camera. This means that when using the remote, if you don't keep careful track of your button pushes, you may stop a recording already in progress when you meant to start one. The phone app shows you what the camera is doing, but running the wi-fi on the camera shortens the battery life somewhat, according to the manual. In the mode we were using, 1080p @ 30fps, the video was using about 106mb/minute. Unless my math is off, that means a 64gb card will store close to ten hours of high-quality video. One gotcha is that if you do change out the batteries, the camera forgets the date and time and you have to re-enter that if you want to tag your files accordingly, which is a bit of a hassle. Would I recommend this camera to a friend? Absolutely. Would I buy it again? Only if we lose the little guy, a definite possibility with something so small. I'd better go write our name and phone number on it with a Sharpie right now!",

Does not include SIM card or handle, just handle/helmet mounts. The video/image quality is great! All our videos from diving look great. Only thing is the camera kept turning off intermittently and would need a few minutes before it was able to turn back on, leaving me to believe it succumbs to the changes in pressure the deeper you dive. Still, it would turn on again. Just don\u2019t expect to get one long continuous video if that\u2019s what you\u2019re buying this camera for. The battery also drained relatively quick. All in all for what I paid I\u2019m very satisfied and happy I have a lot of videos to show our families when we get back home.",

At first I really didn\u2019t have high hopes for it cause of the price. But after using it for the whole week there, going on a sailboat ride and literally putting it to the test by running it under the water as we sailed away, to snorkeling, to just taking random pictures and videos. I must say, this camera exceeded my expectations by 1000%! The camera and picture quality are absolutely great! We uploaded them to my son\u2019s computer to check out the quality and they look awesome on there. Now he wants to start using it to make YouTube videos. The only thing I would say is not the best is the battery life. When the one got to half way, it died almost immediately. Luckily it came with 2 and they charge fairly fast! Other than that, this camera is awesome for the price. So if you\u2019re looking for something cheap and has great quality, I recommend this camera! I usually don\u2019t do reviews but this definitely deserves it!",
