                "reviewText": "The camera was neatly packaged and all parts were labeled and easy to find. The only exception was the mounts for the camera and the solar panel were very similar but of different sizes and there was nothing to indicate which was which. However logic dictated that the larger one was for the camera and the smaller one was for the solar panel.The camera needed to be charged first, and the provided a cable for that purpose. However, you need to provide your own USB charging block. The instructions were large enough to read and easy to follow. Once the app was loaded, the setup was amazingly easy! The app literally talked your through the installation and setup each step of the way. It could not have been a better setup experience.Mounting was simple. I will mention that due to the weight of the camera, you will need to tighten the knuckle quite tightly in order to get it to hold in place. Just be careful not to over-tighten and break it. The solar panel simply plugged in and all was set up and ready to go.The picture quality is amazing. The night vision works well. Motion detection works very well with very few false detections. They were caused from high winds blowing limbs and creating moving shadows all over the scene. Like any motion detection device, objects moving directly towards the camera are a little slow to detect, but any sideways motion is picked up very quickly. I was amazed at the width of the field of view for motion detection. I was moving from the side, almost at a 90 degree angle from forward and it still picked me up. I do not see any down side with this camera. It appears to be of good quality and a good value.",

                "reviewText": "*Upgraded My Overall Review Rating to 5-star (from 4-star):In the last few days I experimented with moving my modem & its router location around to get a better signal strength for my ieGeek Solar Security Camera, and it pays off! I don't even need to use my other extra router nearby. In fact, it's a pretty simple fix: I slide my internet modem/router only three feet away from its previous spot facing closer toward my Security Camera direction, and now it receives a constant 83% to 86% signal strength day & night. It's about 40-42 feet straight-line distance from my modem/router to the camera, with three drywalls through in between my Livingroom to the garage driveway where the camera is currently installed. I'm pretty much happy that my WiFi connection to the camera is solid stable in these last few days. To get to this, I keep staging my modem & router around until I have the best signal strength I want, and I stop it to its current best % signal strength spot. I can tell that staging my modem/router to the higher ground does not necessarily make it to produce a stronger signal, and in my case I place them on a small 27-inch tall table. Perfect!*My Initial Review comment:I own other Security Cameras before, so as a comparison, I can say this ieGeek ZS-GX2S Solar Security Camera has a great HD view quality for the price. I'd say I won't be able to read car license plate numbers from a distance, but it'll display decently my street view with cars passing by up to 3-4 houses away during clear days. I put it on top of my garage driveway area, picking up any Live Motions (on Low set range) within my front yard area without annoying frequent alerts of bugs fluttering around nearby (at night on live mode I can see flying insects flashing by but no/never recording of it in my 128 GB Micro SD Card installed inside the camera). The speaker sound, which I adjust to 100% top volume, is just so-so given its small housing of the camera.I can see with clarity on my recording during the day and acceptable good shots at night time. And that fulfills my purpose of installing this solar camera: to catch who is coming to my garage/front-door area (such as a mail carrier or visiting friend), with easier simple installation of solar panel compared to dragging power supply cable to the electricity wall-plug (almost impossible for this power cable to going through my garage rolling door, or too much work to drill a cable hole through garage sidewall). So far, this solar panel has been supplying a 100% Battery Power with no problems day & night (we live in mid Texas with plenty sunshine this early Spring).Overall (for its price wise, functional performance and ease of installation), this ieGeek Solar Security Camera should easily gets my 5-star review rating if not for its shaky on & off WiFi connections at times. It only receives 70% to 75% internet signal strength from the main modem/router, and to be stable it needs above 80% WiFi signal strength. Right now I'm experimenting with putting an extra router (more) closer to the camera than my main modem/router, and I'll test if it helps to pickup a greater signal. Everything else is decent, installation is quick, except that its screw to hold the camera doesn't tight very well in place causing some slacks if touched. I only installed this camera in almost three weeks now, so I'll see if it holds up on its longer operation. For now I give it a 4-star review rating.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I've long been looking for a wifi security camera that won't stream to some site on the cloud. This camera *can* do that, but you can manage it yourself instead if you would prefer.I used this to check on the bunny that used to live under the shed. Turned out the bunny I had been feeding carrots to was gone, and now they were being eaten by house mice. Stuck it out there for about a week, it worked well even on cold wet nights.Pros:- Doesn't require sending your video to some company in the cloud.- Night vision mode works pretty well at short ranges up to several feet.- Microphone isn't the best, but works.- Has a speaker so you can use it for \"intercom\" mode. Not the best speaker, but it's clear and loud enough to hear.- Motion detection can record short snippets of video, up to 30 secs.- Saves to microSD card in standard MP4 format.- VERY low power use. After 3 days use plugged into a USB power pack, the pack still showed \"full\" charge (ie not much used).- Encrypted video. Since it's not open source as far as I can tell, there's no way to tell if the encryption is any good, but any is better than broadcasting in the clear.- Pretty good resolution. Personally, I doubt the sensor itself really is 1080P, it's likely upscaled to that, but the video is still pretty high res, even in infra-red. Zooming into the video when monitoring it on my phone does reveal extra info, rather than just blurring it.- Seems decently weatherproofed, with all buttons and sockets covered with rubber.- Comes with mounting kits for the camera and the solar panel, and cables for powering it both from either the solar panel, or a USB source.- Seems to have an internal battery, so can work even while there's no light on the solar panels.- Setup took several minutes, but was straightforward and had clear instructions.Cons:- Doesn't allow password protection of the camera, so the encryption is only as good as the key which is likely stored in the app.- Requires an Android/iPhone phone app to view the camera in real-time. No PC/Mac client.- Can't save a constant stream. It only saves snippets from the motion sensor.- Can't stream to the web like a web-cam (this might be a feature of their paid subscription, I don't know).- Unless you pay for an ongoing subscription to their cloud storage, you can't download or share the motion-sensor videos without turning the camera off, removing the microSD card, putting it into a card reader, copying them off, returning the card to the camera, and turning it back on. But the from what I've read on the internet, the camera apparently CAN do this, and USED TO, until they released a software update to the app to prevent it. Kinda sleazy practice, if true.- If your WiFi drops while watching the stream on your phone, then you have to reconnect.- As others have said, be careful when inserting the microSD card, as you can end up shoving it in the gap between the socket and casing, instead of into the socket.Overall, this camera is considerably better than I expected. It would be perfect, if the software were available for PC and not deliberately crippled to be unable to download.",
