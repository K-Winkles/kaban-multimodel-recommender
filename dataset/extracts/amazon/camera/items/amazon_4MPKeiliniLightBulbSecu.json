                "reviewText": "I have some other TP Link products and I really like the app so I figured I would try this camera. I was pleasantly surprised at the ease-of-use and the quality of the Video and sound. It has some really interesting features such as the ability to track movement or be set to a \"patrol mode\" where it rotates through various preset views. It can be mounted on the wall and ceiling or just have it sit on a table. The app has the ability to rotate the picture if you mounted on a ceiling. Best of all, I don't have to subscribe to yet another video streaming storage service. I use this occasionally as a security camera, so the free package lets me store Eight hours of video, which is plenty for what I use it for. If you need more storage, you can buy a plan. The camera takes no time at all to put it on the table, plugged it in (It works off standard 5 V USB) And have it up and running. The TP Link app is one of the best smart device apps I have seen. It works amazingly well for the Smart lights then I have and the same app works incredibly well with this camera. I mostly use it for House security if I'm gone, I have also used it to watch my small dog in our backyard. It's fascinating to watch the Camera track her movements around the yard. And if she is doing something she's not supposed to, I just press the microphone button and I can speak through a speaker on the camera.I think this camera is an excellent value. You get a name brand camera with multiple features for a very affordable price Especially with its night vision, I think this is an excellent security product if you feel you need that. Or it can be used as a nursery camera and I'm sure a variety of other uses.",

It goes up and down, as well as left and right. Zoom is awesome. Audio quality is great. I have nothing negative to say about this camera. The price is unbelievable for the features you receive. The power cord is detachable, unlike their outdoor camera. Kasa app is needed for installation and use. You can set a schedule for record times. You can set zones. You can turn the status LED light off. You can set motion tracking to on where it follows the motion and records. You can adjust the video quality and rotation. You can set it to record video only, video and audio, or not record at all. You can set it to listen for sounds to record. You can set it to record motion that lasts anywhere from 0.1 seconds to 5 seconds. This camera is packed with features! You can even tell Alexa to show it to you on your tv. And she will! It's a little delayed. But it goes through a lot. This camera is highly recommended for anyone looking for these features. I have included a photo with light, and one without for comparison. I'm very impressed.",

We\u2019ve had Kasa smart switches and have recommended them to our friends & family. Like with most of their products, you can schedule the unit to turn on and off through the app which helps with privacy We are very pleased so far with the picture quality including the night vision. We recently installed a Ring Doorbell 2 and the night vision on our Kasa camera is far, far better. The best features are the motion sensor and the fact that you can remote control the camera to swivel around to see the whole downstairs. The camera has a nice swivel angel and covers our entire downstairs. I played with the motion sensor. When turned on, the camera follows me as I move from the living room to kitchen. I am giving this 4 star rather than 5 due to the cheap plastic. I wish it was a little more solid. At least the internal hardware is solid. We have had this camera for 2 days. I will do a follow review after a month or so. Stay tune...",

                "reviewText": "I had already owned a kc120 camera from kasa and was amazed by the excellence of that device. When I received a coupon for this camera I just at the chance to try it out.I have to say this camera lives up to my high expectations. The auto pan/tilt to focus and follow motion is real neat (if not a little Terminator-type creepy). The manual controls to move the camera have a slight delay to respond (mind you this is the android app, not the camera itself) but the delay doesn't expand to stopping (you don't move further than you wanted to).Picture quality, day and night, are great. The only real con to this camera is motor/gear noise. Its not particularly audible to the human ear... in a quiet room you'll barely hear it. Its when its recording the microphone will pick it up. It sounds a bit like the cheap armatron toy I had as a kid. The thing is, to remove this sound from recording, you would need some kind of active noise cancellation... which would increase the price dramatically. It's natural for this sound to occur no matter how you design this. So while its a con, no other company could do better without the aforementioned price increase/noise cancellation. For that reason I still give it full marks.Now I'm just waiting for them to release their doorbell.",
