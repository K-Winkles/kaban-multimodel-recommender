It\u2019s lightweight, making it easy for her to carry around all day without any complaints. The picture quality is impressive; the images are clear, vibrant, and capture our moments beautifully. Additionally, the price point was spot on - it offers great value without breaking the bank.I highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a child-friendly, quality camera that won\u2019t weigh down your adventures. It\u2019s a great way to encourage young ones to explore the world through a lens!",

When it came, it reminded me of the cameras we all used to carry around before our cell phones took pictures...but better. It wasn't flimsy, it had a large display, the mps were impressive and it had settings. My son has now been using it a couple months and LOVES it. He adjusts the settings, uses the preview screen, he edits, the battery holds up and the thing hasn't broke yet (which says a lot because 14 yr old boys are about as delicate as a rhinoceros.) Would definitely buy again! I was even thinking about ordering my 65 yr old mom one for Christmas since it was so easy to use and the display was so large. Definitely a good value and suitable for all ages!",
