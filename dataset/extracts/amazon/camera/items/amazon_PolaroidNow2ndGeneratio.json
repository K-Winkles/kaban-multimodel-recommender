Now granted if you want any good looking pictures I suggest you take pictures when it\u2019s sunny because lighting helps with anything, if it\u2019s cloudy or dark outside I suggest taking pictures up close but overall I\u2019m enjoying this Polaroid camera it works just as intended I\u2019m happy with me being able to take pictures and have them print out plus I love the vintage feel you just gotta play around with it that\u2019s all and have fun with it. :)",

I wish we could have read the reviews before hand or returned the item back in time. The instructions to use the camera are also very lacking in detail so a lot of our photos were messed up. I can\u2019t explain how much i dislike this camera and can\u2019t believe the cost for such low quality.",
