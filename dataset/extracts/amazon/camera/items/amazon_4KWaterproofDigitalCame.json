My kids had taken it over and they were able to easily navigate through to not only take the pictures but review and delete as needed. As I went through the photos, I was pleasantly surprised with the images they captured with this small camera. I could tell that the flash on it works great as there were a few nighttime outings and all were clear and vivid. You will need to provide your own SD card but once you insert it, it's smooth sailing easy setup and good quality pictures. This is an excellent alternative rather than using my very expensive phone underwater, I feel more confident this way. Great purchase!",

Was hoping this camera would be \"good enough\" to avoid carrying our phones to the beach. Boy was I surprised!After letting my teenage daughter take it to the beach this weekend to test it out, I realized that she loved it so much that I am never getting it back! :-). The photos came out great and she loved that she could take it into the water with her and her friends. It is light and easy to use. The front facing screen allowed for better selfies.Looks like I need to order a second one for my upcoming trip!",
