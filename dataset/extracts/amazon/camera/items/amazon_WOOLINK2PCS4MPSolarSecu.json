                "reviewText": "Everything is working great after I bought a longer charging cord. The cord from the solar panel is about 3 feet shorter than my other cameras so to reach my roof where other camera was I had to buy an extension to get sunlight.. It is also a lot better since it had an app update. The pictures are really clear and the night vision is excellent. Very easy to set up and I have not had any disconnections since I installed them. It is surprising being winter it still fully charges everyday. The motion sensor is really good too. Doesn't pick up moving limbs (which is great) but picks up any person, car, and so far a wild pig, coyote, cat and birds! I do wish they came with a longer cord to the solar panel.",

                "reviewText": "This is a camera that just works. The package arrived as scheduled. The housing of the camera is pretty sturdy. I ran into difficulties setting up the camera so I called tech support and a human actually answered the phone and walked me through the setup process. As it turned out, I just entered the wrong password for my wifi. After I entered the correct wifi password, the setup was very quick and easy.After mounting the camera on the house, I had a lot of fun testing and playing around with it. It had more features than I had expected and the features work well. Here are the features that work very well.1. The panning is smooth.2. The night vision and the flood light features both work great at night.3. The solar panel charges the camera battery reliably.4. The standard definition and high definition pictures both look good in color.5. The 2-way communication between the phone and the camera works surprising well.6. The phone app is intuitive.7. The intrusion alerts offer many settings to help configure the sensitivity and frequency. It has a human detection setting that helps avoid false triggers. Or you could just turn the intrusion alert off8. If you want, the camera can also play a list of prerecorded alarm/message to the person detected to either alert him that he is being watched (or welcomed or whatever you want custom message you record)9. From anywhere in the world with an internet connection, you can monitor multiple cameras at different locations on different wifi networks.Here are some nit-picky downsides to this camera.1. Sometimes I notice a 1/2 second lag in the video stream. But this could be caused by my wifi network, so it may not be the camera's fault. But a 1/2 second lag occasionally is not a big deal.2. You can monitor the camera only from a phone. It is not possible to monitor it from a PC. But you can get around this limitation by hooking your phone up to a TV or monitor.3. Voice recordings in HD can be choppy. So I opt to record in standard definition and only switch over to HD only when I really need it.Very please, especially for this price.***One Month Update****After using this product for a month, I'm still very pleased. The connection to the WiFi is reliable. The solar panels keep the batteries charged. The panning is smooth. The cameras hold up in the weather. Great product. No regrets.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the WOOLINK 4MP Solar Security Camera for my outdoor surveillance needs, and I couldn't be happier with its performance. This camera offers a fantastic combination of high-resolution video quality, convenient solar charging, and versatile pan/tilt capabilities.First and foremost, the 4MP resolution delivers crisp and clear video footage, allowing me to see even the smallest details in my outdoor space. The image quality is impressive, whether it's daytime or nighttime, thanks to the camera's excellent night vision. The 2.5K resolution truly stands out, making it easy to identify people or objects in the footage.One of the standout features of this camera is its solar charging capability. The built-in solar panel keeps the camera's rechargeable battery powered, eliminating the need for frequent battery replacements or the hassle of running power cables. This eco-friendly and cost-effective solution not only saves me money but also reduces my carbon footprint.The pan/tilt functionality is another highlight. I can remotely control the camera's view, adjusting it to capture specific areas of interest. This feature provides me with a broader perspective of my property, ensuring that I don't miss any activity. The camera's responsiveness and smooth movement make it easy to position precisely where I want it.Overall, is an excellent investment for anyone looking to enhance their outdoor security. With its top-notch video quality, solar charging, and pan/tilt capabilities, it offers comprehensive coverage and peace of mind. I highly recommend this camera to anyone in need of a reliable and convenient outdoor security solution.",
