                "reviewText": "I received two cameras with my purchase, which was perfect as I was able to install them in my daughters\u2019 rooms. For us, it was less about the camera and more about being able to talk to my girls since they are on the second floor and I\u2019m on the first of our home with a newborn (and I\u2019m sometimes too lazy to go upstairs and ask them a question). Like some of the other reviews mentioned, the night vision is pretty decent. The camera is clear enough and you\u2019re able to view more than one screen/room at a time. There is a little bit of a lag and the speaker does cut off when trying to speak in it- but for the price, it\u2019s a decent product! I do not have the premium package and the basic has worked just fine for me so far!",

So I would have to keep her home, this is a great way to keep an eye on her with out sitting on top of her all the time.( witch drove her nuts) . It is a good product for the price, the others were a bit pricey.",
