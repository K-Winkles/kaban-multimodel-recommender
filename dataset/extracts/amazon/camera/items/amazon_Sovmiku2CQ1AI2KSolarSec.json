Therefore, I wanted to shut the lights off, and alarm. The app allowed all of this, including a sleep mode. The solar panel works great, not always in direct sunlight and it charges nicely. Fortunately the cord is pretty long, each mounts separately. Video quality is good, but I wish I bought the 4mp version, just was going to take longer to get it - but this one serves my purpose. Other cameras around my house will be the newer 4mp. I recommend this.",

I have two around my house now and definitely plan on getting more! I can't recommend these enough. They're very easy to setup and connect as well. Well made! I was a little worried about when it rained having the holes in the back for the speaker. But it's rained a lot since I've had them and it still works like new!",

I am also amazed that the camera angle can be moved to see a wide range. The only issue that is not satisfactory to me is that it only does recording when there is motion up to 20 seconds. This camera is sold as a \"security camera\" therefore it should allow continuous recording at least during set times.",

They were super easy to install, and we got snow a couple days after. They have been doing their Job well for a week without any issues. The app works great, video and voice all work excellent as does the night vision. They seem to charge great during the day. The only think I would like to see improved is the time it takes to alert you. It takes about 10-15 seconds to get the notice and it also takes 20sec or so to connect to the cameras. A little slow, but still for the money this is a winner.",
