                "reviewText": "Unboxing:The camera came with extra batteries for both the camera and the remote, a thoughtful touch. It included all necessary cabling and a complimentary microphone. Add your own memory card and it's ready to go.Testing:In well-lit environments, the camera's sensor performs admirably, but it struggles in dim areas. Unfortunately, the microphone's signal-to-noise ratio is notably poor, rendering it essentially unusable. Camera controls were not entirely intuitive but easy enough to figure out. The infrared (IR) capability emerged as a standout feature.Final Thoughts:This camera for hobby use excels in niche scenarios like recreating early 2000s aesthetics or venturing into low-light environments for some spooky cinematography with IR or simple recording. A great tool for a novice videographer, it proves to be an enjoyable and functional camera for specific, lighthearted purposes.",

Can be used as a conference camera for your laptop or for filming videos to upload. A lot of stuff for a very good price. I bought a different camera last year and one of my kids wanted their own. This one seems to have more filming options with a better monitor for viewing. It was a good deal!! I asked a question prior to purchasing and they responded quickly.",

Does come with 2 batteries and a stabilizer handle to make an action video which is kind of helpful if you are making videos on a move or gardening project which is what I am going to do. Has an external mic option that provides with crisper sound and has all necessary wires to connect to the camera in the box which is great. The only con I have is that it does not come with a memory card which would be great. The camera quality for video and still images is really good. I will recommend if you are in the market for entry level video camera to start your journey in vlogging or videography.",

Normal size SD card.Charges directly from the camera which is a little inconvenient (as shows in the last photo).Strap is adjustable but it's still too big for us, I had to stitch it to fit.Overall tho I'm satisfied with the product.

I used to be content with my phone camera, but not after getting this nifty device!The 1080P is great for a camera of this size - I use iMovie to edit my videos and I've had no trouble getting the footage onto iMovie and then eventually processing it for use on YouTube.The remote control of the camera is also extremely useful, especially when I'm filming alone and able to stick the camera on a tripod facing me. The remote can stay in my pocket and be subtly clicked without having to run back to the camera.I will also say that I really appreciate the value provided by the inclusion of such a high quality microphone with the added wind cushion protection. I haven't found any issues recording outdoors and picking up high quality audio from this microphone. It sounds as if I've run it through adobe podcast, without even having to do that! I don't think I'll need any other camera, this one does it all!",
