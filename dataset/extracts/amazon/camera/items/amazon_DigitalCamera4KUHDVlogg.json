Two batteries are really handy.Good for casual photography and experiment in outside. Good gift to kids who don't have mobile phone yet. They like point and shoot cameras. Flash light is not very strong but does the job. It's important to learn AF feature to get best results.",

It came with two batteries which charged quickly as well as memory card for 32GB which is good. The picture quality itself was good for the price of the camera and was even better when transferred to a PC. Doesn\u2019t make too many noises when using it. Overall good quality and simple to use. Good gift option as well.",

I primarily use the sports/action cameras to record my adventures when traveling but figured I would add something for the more calm, less adventurous moments and this camera is a nice fit to that role. I do wish it had ports for external microphone, display or ring light. But for the price, the camera is still good. And it comes with 2 batteries as well as the SD card which I consider a huge bonus! I wouldn't say this camera is for professionals but it adds nicely to my travel kit!",
