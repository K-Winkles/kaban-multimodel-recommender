So many of the options I don\u2019t need because I love to do photo editing but maybe some people like to edit on the camera. The wifi link up is relatively easy and you can download the pictures and video on to your phone and delete them from the camera so you don\u2019t run out of memory. The battery seems good tho I burned it making some cooking video of my wife. it went fast! i love the purple and the feel of it.",

                "reviewText": "I'm one of those photographers who while on a budget still likes to have toys to play with. This camera is one of those many toys I've purchased over the years. It was never intended to be a daily shooter for me just something I took out on occasion to take some pictures with for fun. Like, for instance, the train yard not far from my house is a fave place to go take pics. The tracks that lead to them and yard itself provide some fantastic opportunities. Lots of great shots. It actually does perform quite well and I was pleased at the quality of the resulting pictures.But there is one major drawback and that's the processing time between shots. And if you're the type of person who wants to take that next shot immediately this is not your camera. I used it in sport mode the time at the yards so I'd get get between 3 and 5 shots per click of the shutter. And the downtime between shots is anywhere between 5 to 20 seconds. So you get this spot on shot of a bird sitting on the caboose and then want to get a shot of the bird closer up you'll be waiting for a few moments. Which will likely mean the opportunity is gone by the time the camera is ready again. This makes it nearly impossible to use in a setting such as sports where you have to be ready at all times.That aside the pictures you get are pretty great. The zoom is fantastic (especially with a tripod) and will get you close to places that you normally can't get too. I'd say it's definitely worth the money. I'm very pleased with the purchase overall. But definitely upgrade the included memory card.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this camera for a once in a lifetime trip to Morocco. I travel for work and so did not open the box as soon as I got it as I was not home. When I did open the box, all seemed to be correct, but then set off on another job assignment. I got back home in November just in time to go on my trip and this is what I found:Pros: everything that was supposed to be in the package was there. The product was nice looking as described, and the 67X zoom function was fantastic. The first photos I took as practice photos were fine on the included memory card. My only complaint at that time would be that it did not come with a UV filter. It took me about a week to find somebody that sold a UV filter to fit this camera.Cons: intermittently I would get an error message on the view screen stating \u201cmemory card not formatted, format now? \u201c. It would then go on to tell me that if I formatted the card I would lose all of my photos. I would have to turn the camera off and turn it back on, basically reboot, for this message to go away. The next time I would try to shoot, the message would come back. I would finally turn the camera off and resort to using my iPhone which gave me beautiful photos but no 67X zoom. I would try the camera again and I would be able to shoot four or five photos But when turning the camera off in between photo sites and then turning it back on I would get the same error message regarding formatting of the memory card and would be unable to take photos. I would have to resort again using my iPhone. Completely unacceptable. I have just returned from my trip only to find out the exchange window is closed.I don\u2019t think I will purchase from the seller again.",

                "reviewText": "I got this during Prime Days, so I don't know how the pricing has changed...but it's a decent quality consumer level camera.The zoom on this thing is incredible...and it's an optical zoom, so you don't get the pixelation like some cameras give if you zoom in too far.One nice thing about this particular unit, is that I can get a 23 minute video before it stops recording. Most other cameras like this I've used will stop after only 12 minutes of recording.My biggest complaint about the camera is the reaction time from pressing the shutter button, until the picture is actually taken. I've taken over 2000 pictures with the camera already, and many of the quick action scene shots I tried for, I missed. BUT, it has a multi-shoot option, where if you hold the shutter button down, it'll rapid fire a bunch of pictures in a row. That's how I rectified the slow shutter speed issue...BUT, it takes a while to recover from that mode and process all the shots.",
