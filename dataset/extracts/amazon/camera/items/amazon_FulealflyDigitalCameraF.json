It takes good quality photos, has a pretty good battery life, and is sturdy! She has dropped it multiple times but the shell of the camera has a kind of rubbery quality to it and it is still in perfect working condition. The included lanyard is great, when she uses it, though! I definitely recommend this camera for young kids. She's having a blast taking videos and photos.",
