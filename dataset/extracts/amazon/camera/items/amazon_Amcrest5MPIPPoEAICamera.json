                "reviewText": "The IP5M-B1276EB-AI is a nice outdoor camera. It has several nice features as specified on the Amcrest website including active deterrent which actives a built in LED light when something moves within a specified area. The camera has nice video during the day and night. The nighttime IR vision is great, but I was slightly unhappy with the nighttime color vision. However, if you set the light to come on with motion (night vision Smart Illumination) the video is very clear in color. I had to call support to figure out that you must have smart motion detection on in order for the night vision Smart Illumination to work. The support people were helpful with this and a few other small issues. The camera is not wireless, so I purchased an Amcrest POE to hook it up. There is an AC adapter plug if you prefer to purchase an AC adapter and not use POE. It was easy to set up and worked perfect. This camera is very powerful if you want to play with it but it works fine with the defaults out of the box.",

                "reviewText": "You will need a PoE cable and switch to power this camera, or use a PoE injector. This is not a wireless camera.Installation is pretty straightforward, drill the mount holes and drill a hole through the center of the mount for the cables to route. The cables are hidden after installation. I have a small PoE switch, so only one ethernet cable was required for data and power. Hardware seems really solid, the housing is metal, waterproof, and feels like the camera should last a very long time.Night vision is really great for the price. Human and vehicle detection work really well. Video is smooth and good quality. The color nightvision works a lot better than I expected it to. The tripwire feature is really great.I use this with Home Assistant and offsite storage with sftp. No cloud subscription required. I love the flexible storage options and I'll keep buying Amcrest cameras as long as they offer flexible storage.",

                "reviewText": "Let me say that I already have many Amcrest IP cameras and after testing several brands I settled on Amcrest. Their free surveillance software and build quality have kept me with them for many years.I recently had the chance to try out this camera, and overall, I was quite impressed with what it had to offer. From its well-protected packaging to its easy-to-find online instructions and high-quality build, this camera really exuded a premium feel right out of the box.One of the standout features of this camera was its picture and video quality, which was simply superb. The camera captured clear and detailed images, even in low light conditions, and the video was smooth and stable. I also appreciated the easy access memory door and the fact that it was rubber sealed with no fall-out screws, which made it simple to upgrade the camera's storage capacity without any fuss.Another great feature of this surveillance camera was its low power consumption, which is a real plus for anyone looking to save on energy costs. And the fact that it was compatible with the Surveillance Pro software was a huge bonus, as this is a top-of-the-line program that can really enhance the camera's functionality.That being said, there were a few areas where this camera fell short. For example, I wasn't a big fan of the fact that the memory door was located on the bottom of the camera, which made it easy for anyone to notice and potentially steal the memory card. Additionally, while the Surveillance Pro software was great overall, I did find that it had some trouble auto-finding the camera at installation.Finally, I was a bit disappointed that I had to change the bracket for an upgrade, as the new version required a 3-hole mount instead of the previous 4-hole design. This may not be a big deal for everyone, but it did require some additional work on my end that I wasn't expecting. I will probably make some sort of 3d printed adapter so I do not have to drill new holes when replacing additional cameras.Overall, I think this surveillance camera is a great option for anyone looking for high-end performance and build quality. While there are a few areas where it could use some improvement, these are relatively minor issues that don't detract from the camera's overall appeal.",
