We're still playing with it but with the sim card, it's perfect to control at any time. Even have voice control if necessary..............which is a nice option. This camera does a lot for the price and seems very efficient. Think it's a good \"safety feature\" we feel comfortable having.",

                "reviewText": "I loved this camera so much I purchased two of them. The camera takes excellent videos and photos. It was very easy to set up and get running without any issues. I got 2 camera to testing and evaluated to save my time. After set-up you can choose different setup for alert for movement and record a 10,20 or 30 sec option video. What is also great is that you can go onto the app and see what your camera is looking at and set up \"alert areas\" or where exactly you want the camera to alert within its field of view. The best thing for me is that resolution it\u2019s really amazing during daylight and at darkest the flash light turn on which gives a great resolution as well. Also the sd micr SIM card there\u2019s no need for any subscription at all which is up to 128gb ( enough for at least 12 months before formatting and reuse it again). overall this cam does exactly what I want it to do as to alerting me when someone is near my home and I have to say with all the little caveats I am very very satisfied with this camera. Its price point is great and it actually does what the company advertises. I am glad I purchased this camera.As recommended by other reviewers here I have configured all Cameras under Motion Detection Sensitivity set @ 10 (max). I also use 128 GB SD card ($9) and do not subscribe to CloudEdge Application Services. Connecting the cameras to my Eero Pro 5 mesh 2.4 GHz network was seamless and smooth operation.Really love this camera. We have several throughout our property and they all work very well. Images are clear in both day and night viewing. Would highly recommend this camera for anyone looking solar powered camera. Easy to install and operate.Overall... great product.",

                "reviewText": "I was a bit hesitent with the low price compared to other cameras, but decided to take a chance with the 4.7 review rating. There are minor flaws, but from my research it's a common issue with motion-based camera recording, especially at this price range. I purchased a total of 9 cameras, but had to return 2 cameras. All 9 cameras worked, but 2 of the cameras included Yellow LED instead of White color LED for some reason - QA related issue. It's been 3 weeks since install and soo far.. I am very impressed.As you can see in the picture I've included, I mounted my cameras inside of the roof overhang, so little of it is exposed. The only exception are the solar panels which are mounted outside facing south. My house faces East, so you only see the side of the solar panels. The cable is 4 feet long, so I purchased a 9-pk of plastic 15.5\" cable raceways for cable management and mounted it on top of the cameras (gray bar) - $20. The raceway can hold up to (3) 4 ft. cables - a bit tight, but it fits. It made the install look more professional and cleaner that way. I really took advantage of the 355\u00b0 PTZ feature to get the cameras aimed at a specific angle or to cover a specific zone/area. Cameras in portrait mode are only used for main doors (e.g. front door, garage door), while the majority of my cameras are in natural position (mounted horizontally) capturing video in landscape mode. The video can be flipped upside down, which allows you to mount the camera in any different position you can imagine.As recommended by other reviewers here I have configured all Cameras under Motion Detection Sensitivity set @ 10 (max). I also use 128 GB SD card ($9) and do not subscribe to CloudEdge Application Services. Connecting the cameras to my Eero Pro 5 mesh 2.4 GHz network was seemless and smooth operation.Motion Detection Settings:- Detection Sensitivity set @ 10 (max)- Custom Mode:-- Recording Time: 30 second- Alarm Interval: OffWith the above settings, majority of my cameras go down from 100% battery to 90-95% in low traffic areas. For high traffic areas, the battery can go down to as low as 81%. Once sun rises and we have a full day of sunlight, the battery will be at 100% again by noon. In Southern California, we did experience 4 straight days of cloud & 1 day of rain. The battery was literally at max for the low traffic areas by sunset. However, the high traffic areas dropped to as low as 51%. It took 1 full day of sunlight to go from 51% to 80% charge. By the 2nd day that camera was fully charged like the other cameras. On a cloud day, I would say the battery recharge is about 30-35% increase, while on a cloudy day or rainy day we can get a 10-15% recharge. Also keep in mind the camera is using the power while battery is still being recharged throughout the day. I would not be concerned with running low on batteries at all. I have not tried other Camera application before, but find CloudEdge to be useful even though there are some slight flaws. It can take 3-5 seconds before you can view the live feed. For PTZ, it can take up to 10 seconds before the camera actually moves. Soo after you press the button - wait. As for saving the recorded footage to your phone, you have to manually press the record button to start & stop. This works for previous recordings or live recording. I find the calendar to be accurate in pulling the specific recording date you need, but there is a lag in getting the recording, so again patience is key.Like other reviewers have mentioned, there seems to be a 2-3 second loss of recording in the beginning, which is why I have set my recordings to all 30 seconds. I have also mounted multiple cameras to cover any specific area. While this does have the ability to record audio, you can barely make out what anyone is saying even if they were standing 10 feet in front of the camera. You can hear bits and parts, but not enough to make a full sentence. If the person was shouting, then you can hear it audibly. All 7 of my cameras are in the same perdictament, so I don't think it was just 1 bad camera, unless all 7 are bad. A YouTube Reviewer also said the same thing and his demonstration also validated what I exhibited with the audio recorded with the footage. Soo there is a set back or flaw with audio being recorded.I paid $55 for 2 cameras & $60 for the other 5 cameras. Even with the flaws mentioned above, I feel this camera deserves a 5 star rating, expecially at this price point for what it does. I intend to install more cameras to cover the back yard and side of the house and will eventually end up with 16-20 Rebluum cameras in total all running on MicroSD. 128 GB will last about 3 months in high traffic area and about 8 months in low traffic area. Oldest recording will be overwritten once memory card gets full. I also plan to use a 2nd different camera system for just the main doors (possibly riing doorbell/camera system), while Rebluum will cover every inch of the property. Alerts only enabled for the main doors.",
