                "reviewText": "First off, everything about PD products is top notch. This strap is no different. The thin sleek design is a positive and prevents fighting the strap when shooting between landscape and portrait camera positions. Another big plus for me is the length of the strap. I\u2019m a tall guy and I really dislike straps that render the camera hanging on my lower chest or belly area. This one allows the camera to hang at my waist / hip area - just where I want it. Along with the interchangeability across several cameras by using the small attachment tabs (unique to PD straps), this strap is a winner. I have three of these straps now and use them across numerous cameras.",

                "reviewText": "This product has been around a while, but this strap system is still one of the best for comfort and adaptability. I use the strap in two ways:1) Latched on to the camera case in a traditional shoulder strap configuration.2) To carry the camera itself, from its tripod mount when camera fitted with a larger telephote lens. This way the lens does not bounce around when walking, yet the camera is very easy to instantly access for shooting.Definitely recommended, especially for the latter use.",

If I add a heavier lens such as a 70-200, this strap may be too thin for the weight and it may cut into your should some. I got it for the light setup though. A heavier one, and I\u2019d opp for one of the other Peak Design wider straps.",

                "reviewText": "I was reluctant to spend the money for this product. I read the reviews and trusted the info folks posted about their satisfaction with the strap. I'm glad I did.The quality of the strap is very good, and I don't think I could have chosen a better strap as far as comfort. I'm using it on a small frame Canon though (GX7 iii) so the weight was already not an issue. What I found was wearing the strap for hours a day while traveling and touring was just like putting on another piece of clothing. I often kept the camera and strap hanging inside a shirt. Easy enough to grab the strap and pull up the camera when it was time to take a shot.I found the thickness of the connecting loop from the quick-connect piece was good quality but was too think to feed through the narrow Canon attachment points at the sides of the camera's body. The attachment plate for the bottom of the camera was excellent; however for this model of camera which burns through batteries, loosening the plate to change batteries became inconvenient. I attached a thinner, small piece of strong material to the attachment point on the left side of the camera and then attached the Peak Design quick-connect pieces to this added loop. Worked fine. The trick is finding a good, strong piece of material to attack to the camera.Anyways, glad I spent the money and I understand now why others have given this product high ratings.",

                "reviewText": "I have the old leash strap and I love it. In fact, I love all of the old versions of Peak Design products better than the newer replacements. But I needed another strap and wanted to go as minimal as I could.This Leash strap is pretty good, but the strap is thicker than the old one, meaning it's more stiff. Also, the way they package these straps into the box, they have annoying creases in them. However, I had an idea that maybe I could use an iron on low setting to get them straight, so I googled it and found that I could.I would recommend to use a LOW heat setting, and only turn it up as needed (it doesn't take much heat to do the job). I'm sure if you go too hot, you will melt the strap. So just keep that in mind. But now that I have completely removed any kinks in the straps, I like them much more.",

                "reviewText": "This is my second Peak Design strap, this one purchased for my Canon R100 camera.I don't keep a strap on my cameras 100% of the time, so a good quick-release is key for me.I like the way peak does the release, it's solid when connected and fairly unobtrusive when disconnected.The quality of the construction seems to be top-notch, time will tell. But for a smaller bodied camera like the R100, The Leash is the perfect size.",

                "reviewText": "Probably like most, I saw all the straps for half the price of this one. I\u2019ve even owned third party straps for cameras way cheaper than this, but trust me. This ones different.The attention to detail is profound, just the material used both the strap itself and the metal components.Even the quick release plastic parts feel polished and smoothed around the corners, no sharp jagged bits to just tip you over into a bad mood when your having one of those days!Peak Design have undoubtedly obsessed over the manufacturing process and I sincerely appreciate it.Just a darn good strap that feels like it\u2019s gonna last a lifetime.",
