Im extremely happy and grateful and love my camera works great!I bought this camera because someone posted a video and I thought this is great, perfect for my furrbabies. I loved it and thought it was good.It was doing great loved watching my babies when I was in my office . Picture quality is good. The voice feature is nice but has a slight echo. The problem is that it was working fine and suddenly the sensor detector stop functioning. Then after two days it stopped working completely. I\u2019m very disappointed that it didn\u2019t last. Only lasted one month.",

I can talk to her too. Works well. I like that I can put it in private mode. Not sure if the cat will be happy that I can bother her. Will be funny to see her snub me.The price was right and I think quality is really good taking price into consideration. Does all it was advertised to do.",
