                "reviewText": "This was my first remote cam so it was a learning experience. Picture is excellent. It's been reliable from day one. This is an entry level camera so it has few features. But that's all I wanted, just a camera to show a fixed view of the inside of the garage and let me know when the door goes up and whether the car is there. Does the job perfectly. Day vision is a very nice picture, night vision is more than adequate. The app for iPad works seamlessly. BUT setting the camera up was a battle of incomplete directions and poorly programmed timing on the camera itself. If you're comfortable with figuring your way through wifi connections and changing networks (you have to switch quickly back and forth between the network of the camera and your home network) then you'll probably get this figured out. If technical things are a challenge - this camera will likely be frustrating. My biggest disappointment is that Tapo doesn't provide an app for PC and that's where I wanted to use it. However, some googling quickly led me to Agent DVR (a free program) which the Tapo will work with. That too was an uphill battle to get it configured correctly, but now I've got it. Agent DVR will also let you add additional cameras which you can view simultaneously. In contrast, the Tapo app for iPad only lets you view one camera at a time (though it's easy to switch between them). Overall, the setup was way more complex than I expected. But now that it's set up, it works exactly as I'd hoped.",

                "reviewText": "I own two Tapo cams now. I use them all the time. I now live in a motel, 6 month lease, and it's not the best area. So I bought this one on a different one so they can cover my butt when I leave for shopping or work or whatever. Very easy to set up. Very easy to use the software app. The video quality is excellent and not choppy. But the audio recording and the two-way feature have something for the company to work on. You can understand some of what someone says in the room when it's recording, but that isn't good quality at all. That's my only gripe. After a little research into these type of devices, I find that in most cases, excellent audio doesn't come and tell your head a $90 or above product. And I mean that I seem to hear that about all brand product. I'm not saying that I don't like this product because I do. I very much do. If I was able to get a bigger place, I wouldn't hesitate to buy a couple more of these. They are very small and easy to tuck away.I love the feature that it has for storing the videos, both on a media card and cloud storage. The cloud storage comes with a 30-day trial after which you will have to pay for a month subscription. If you're using these for real security reasons, I would highly recommend to go ahead and get your 30-day subscription that will support multiple items at once. You won't need to have to get a subscription for each one. That way if the place does get robbed, I can only assume that they would snag these cams thinking they would take the evidence with them. The cloud storage stops that. After testing a lot of times what the label is like when I walk into my room as it is secured until my phone receives the alert, sending a photo of the visitor to my phone immediately. Well immediately meeting within 10 seconds sometimes 15 seconds. Well that's good enough for me.I also like the fact that it has the option to activate an alarm as well as motion detection recording. It sounds like the standard alarm clock on your phone. The volume is about the same as a decent phone turned all the way up for alarm. It does in fact echo out into the Hall with my door closed.",

                "reviewText": "My neighbor's house was recently broken into and I thought I should take some measures to secure my home a little more. I bought this camera because I wanted something that had local storage and didn't force me to pay a subscription. I was pleasantly surprised by how good of quality this camera is for the price. The Tapo app is easy to navigate and I like the choice of settings. The AI Person detection doesn't always trigger, but the Motion detection will catch them. There's also a Baby Crying sound detection that I haven't tested because, well, no babies here.This camera works perfectly for its intended use for indoors, but I originally bought this thinking I could perch it on the front window sill and aim it through the glass at the front door to deter burglars, see who's knocking on my door, and make the camera harder to steal. This works for the day time, but when night vision turns on (and I haven't found a way to disable this mode) the window screen obstructs the view, so now this camera lives elsewhere.I wish Tapo had a wireless video doorbell that was available in the US (maybe they're working on it), but for now I also have the outdoor camera, as well as the contact sensors to monitor the doors and windows opening. So far I like the system and the price point is a little better than others, especially since cloud storage isn't mandatory (but if you do get it, it's $3.49 a month per device).The only real negative I've experienced is that moving shadows during the day and floating specks of dust at night can set off the motion detection, even on the lowest sensitivity. But probably better to be too sensitive than not enough.",
