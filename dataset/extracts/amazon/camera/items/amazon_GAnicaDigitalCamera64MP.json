Kids brought this camera when we were hiking because of the light weight of the camera. It has 16X digital zoom which is good enough for young kids although it lacks optical zoom. A 32GB TF card was included in the camera which can help to save a few bucks. It is a good choice for young kids to learn photography at an early stage.",
