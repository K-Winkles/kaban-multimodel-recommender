                "reviewText": "This is a great little digital camera. It comes in a few different colors to choose from and it is very compact and lightweight, yet, sturdy at the same time. It comes with a 32 GB USD card for storage that's easy to put in and take out. It comes with a decently long charging cord to charge the camera and charges to a full charge rather quickly. It takes really good pictures for it's size and price point and has a16 X zoom. The buttons on this camera are easy to push and it's very easy to navigate through the different features of this camera. I chose the purple camera, which is a soft, muted purple. You can record with this camera, or take still photos. It takes a universal type C USB charging cord, so if you lose the charger it comes with, or it gets damaged in some way, you can use another cord that connect to your cell phone. It's easy enough to navigate through through the different features and to operate, that even a child could use it. It would make a perfect gift for Christmas, or a birthday. All in all, this is a great little camera for adults and children and I would recommend it. \ud83d\ude42",

                "reviewText": "The camera was great for a 6yr old to use on a road trip. Easy to use ( take photos, videos, delete etc). Endured constant drops a child would do without breaking. Photos were clear and it has zoom feature. Convenient for a child to carry around the National Parks. We got the black color and so far no scratches. I\u2019d recommend for a child beginning the love of photography. Had a memory card which was enough storage for our trip. Easy to download photos on to a computer. Great buy.",

                "reviewText": "My 11 year old daughter was going on a school summer camp and she wanted to take a camera with her to document the fun. This turned out to be a perfect camera for her to take. The pictures turned out great and it was great for her to have something to capture the fun and create memories from her trip. The video recording (especially the audio quality) isn't really great at all, but pictures are good enough for memories. Having an SD card slot makes it easy to pull the pictures off the camera.Instruction for your child on how to take a picture will get better results.Hold the camera still while the picture is being takenGive the camera a second or two before moving it away so the picture isn't blurryTry and not take pictures in the dark or where there isn't much lightOutdoor pictures turn out better since there is usually more light for the camera.I need to give some props to the company. I really wanted to have an extra battery to make sure she had enough, so I contacted them and they sent me 2 batteries. That was awesome and I was able to send her with enough battery to last the 3 days she was gone. The battery life was much longer than I anticipated and she only used half of the first battery. It will be great to have the extra batteries to keep it going for many many hours.",

Simply designed, great functionality and easy to use. Great 1st camera for your children. Got it for my 6year old daughter, who has no camera experience besides my phone and she figured out how to use it own her own as well as record videos. Already took a ton of photos and the Images are sharp & clear. The videos are great quality. The battery last a long time before charging. Perfect camera for beginners and children. I would buy another one for myself.",
