                "reviewText": "I ordered this camera with cautious optimism. I wasn't expecting a whole lot for under $100. When it arrived, I was impressed with the solid build & feel of the camera. My Canon cost 3 times what I paid for this camera, & this camera takes sharper pictures (the picture of our kitten was one of the first photos I took with it - - - check out the high resolution).I didn't really get a lot of info from the user's manual, but if you spend a little time with this camera, you learn a lot. I've never owned a camera with a mini sd card, & I did have an adapter on hand to upload the pictures I took to our laptop. There is a 'mode', 'menu' 18x zoom & different settings on the back of the camera that are easy to understand. I do wish that the zoom was more powerful than 18x, but I'm cool with it. The built in flash works great, too. There is a lot to like with this camera! I'm very happy with it.One thing I didn't mention in my original review is the quality of the videos with this camera, and the sound quality. I can't take videos indoors with my Canon . . . there usually isn't enough light. This camera, however, produces crystal clear, bright and colorful videos, even at night if there's a light on in the room. Great clarity & sound videos.",

I'm not the best photographer but this was easy to use with good quality pictures. Also switching between taking pictures and videos was not a problem.

                "reviewText": "I purchased this camera after being misled of its quality. It is called the \"4K CAMERA\" but it is not 4K in quality. They mislead people by using the brand name 4K. The image quality is garbage, like my 12mp camera from 15+ years back when webcams were being used...It has a cheap body, buttons are plastic and look like they are wheels or movable but are just stagnant plastic pieces, like something you would see on a kids camera where they allude to it being fancy by its just pretend buttons. The lens looks like it is manual but it is actually just really terrible and cheap. The camera pretends to have high-end features but it is as good as kids camera from Walgreens. I recommend you buy the Nikon Coolpix camera from nearly 15 years ago before you even tough this. For the price, I hoped the pictures would at least look crisp and not blurry, but I set my expectations too high. HARD PASS.",
