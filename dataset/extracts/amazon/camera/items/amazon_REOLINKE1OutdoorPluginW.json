                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Camera!",
                "reviewText": "The E1 outdoor camera is an excellent buy. I wanted to set something up to monitor my driveway and entryway. Some of the things I was looking for were:Local storage without a subscription. The camera can take a 256GB micro SD card and holds recordings for days and days. I have been using for a week and it's not even half full. You can go back to specific days and check the events by watching or downloading. Once the card is full it overwrites. What's nice is, because of the smart detection. I can filter out videos based on if it's a motion, vehicle, person, or animal event.Constant power. I didn't want battery. This comes with its own power supply and a long extension cord. The extension cord is about 14 feet long with a few extra feet of cord on the power supply.Wifi and Network capability. The Wifi connection is good. Able to connect on a 2.4ghz or 5ghz band. It also has an ethernet adapter. Also has the ability to connect with Alexa via a skills app. The Reolink app for alexa works great. I can ask Alexa to show me the camera on my Echo Show or Fire Tablet and it pulls it up with no problemSetup was really simple. I connected it to my network via ethernet for the initial setup. Installed the app on my phone and went through the process. One thing I will stress. **UPDATE THE FIRMWARE** Not the app update. Go to the website and follow the instructions on how to download the latest firmware and how to update it. This solved some initial issues that I was having.The Reolink phone app is great. Lots of different options to fiddle with. For example. Being able to setup non-detection zones (in my case blocking out the road so passing traffic doesn't trigger a recording), Night vision, motion tracking, color/black and white options, smart detection.... These are things that are fun to mess around with and decide what is right for you. Overall the app is very easy to use.There are other things as well. Setting up a PC client, Accessing from a browser, using an FTP server, Remote monitoring, and the use of an NVR system.And... the picture quality is great. Overall I am extremely happy with this purchase.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Simple, economical way to build a surveillance system",
                "reviewText": "These cameras work as indoor and outdoor. I now have three of them and am slowly building a surveillance system around my home. Most surveillance systems, while already costing $500 and up, require either a monthly subscription and/or a DVR to save video. With this camera, you can buy one at a time. The camera has a hidden area to add a 256GB micro-SD card. You can access via smart phone or PC application to monitor your cameras. It sets up very easy and quickly. You will need a power source nearby for each camera. In my opinion, this is a better way to set up a surveillance system across your home/business without forking out a large amount of money at once. As mentioned I am buying one at a time and now have three. Total video storage at the moment is roughly 750GB total, One more camera and I will have the same storage as most packages with DVR and for less overall. It has plenty of features such as Pan/Tilt/Zoom aka PTZ, vehicle, human, and animal recognition, motion detection, night vision, 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz wifi compatible, flood light and alarm. This camera offers 3X optical zoom and 5mp (2560x1920p) HD video which is important. Do not sacrifice the resolution. Go at least 5mp or higher. The higher the better. You may need it one day to get a license plate number or a clear facial image. I give five stars for this camera and highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using three E1 Outdoor cameras for a year now. Here's my take on their strengths and weaknesses.Pros:- High-quality video and audio.- Multiple access options, including the embedded browser, mobile app, desktop app, and RTSP.- Very configurable, including options for display, audio, detection sensitivity, notifications, FTP, and users.- Affordable.- Exceptional customer support. The team is professional, responsive, and has resolved all my queries and complaints within a 24 hours.Cons:- The camera tends to drift from its guard point after tracking an object, making the auto-tracking feature virtually unusable. This is a known issue, as even customer support acknowledges that it occurs across all their PAN cameras.- Lack of firmware updates. There are at least two hardware versions of the E1 Outdoor, IPC_523SD8 and IPC_566SD85MP. However, only the IPC_566SD85MP is being updated on Reolink's download center.",

                "reviewText": "Good picture quality, the spotlights that activate when set off work really well as does the siren although it is not very loud (just be careful on the sensitivity settings as it will go off in the night far more than you want if not careful.The main drawback is the pan and tilt. it works great and tracks well but after it tracks motion a few times, it loses it's monitoring point and stays stuck facing to the extreme right (or left) and won't return to the monitoring point, at which time you need to go into the app and reset the monitoring point again. This happens very regularly. Not sure if it is a firmware issue or a mechanical issue.EDIT: Reolink customer service was fantastic and responded quickly to the issue, sent me a new camera that is working very well with no issues and refunded me the shipping cost to send the old camera back. Upgrading the rating from a 3 star to a 5 star.",

                "reviewText": "Reolink cameras are excellent. We now have 13 of them installed in different areas on our property. Their iPhone software is excellent as well. However, when it comes to their Windows software, an application that should allow constant monitoring of one or more cameras, the software is abominable.Older versions (8.2) will run trouble free one day and lock up every few minutes another. It is extremely frustrating. All the newer versions, without exception, are even worse. The last one we tried, version 8.10.4 is, somehow, the worse to date. It doesn't seem to pick-up the cameras that the previous version was connected to, nor is it able to recognize cameras that offer right-left and up-down capabilities.Just to be clear, whether the computer is running Windows 10, or another totally different and newer computer is running Windows 11, the result is the same. Reolink's software locks up randomly; not great if the person monitoring the video feed fails to notice that the displayed time from the cameras stopped some time ago.While I can understand, and excuse teething pains in a new company, this Windows software situation, considering that Microsoft has the biggest share of the Operating System market, is ridiculous.Reolink, it's time to step up your game.Revised on November 30 2023.I recently installed Reolink's newest software for Windows. What a change! This new version v8.14.2 is stable and works reliably. If installing it, make to uninstall ANY previous version. And we are now running 16 Reolink cameras. Take that as a vote of confidence.",
