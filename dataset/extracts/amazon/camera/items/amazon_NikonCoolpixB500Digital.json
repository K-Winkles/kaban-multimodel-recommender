                "reviewText": "I wanted a camera that took good pictures, without requiring a lot of fiddling with adjustments and without breaking the bank. This camera has filled the niche for me. The camera has several settings that are automatic , which cover different photo situations. The \u201cSmart Scene\u201d is your go to automatic option. It works well most all situations, whether normal or long distance. The \u201cMacro\u201d for up close on small objects works nice too. In the photos I attached, the flower was taken on Macro. This flower was about 3/4 of an inch wide. The lizard in the photo, was about 5-6 inches long and I took the picture from 20 feet away, with the camera set on Smart Scene. I was impressed that it took such a good picture of a small object, from so far away. The zoom is great. The camera isn\u2019t too bulky and the weight is good. I carried it around my neck for three long days of checking out a zoo, an aquarium and a museum. Battery life was good too. I took a lot of pics and never changed batteries. On that note, it uses 4 AA batteries. I like this as opposed to a rechargeable battery, as you can throw extra batteries in your pocket and switch them out n the fly if the camera dies. Here are the cons: The auto focus can take several seconds to resolve itself. Not a deal breaker, but can be irritating. The flash will not auto deploy. You must manually extend it, if you think flash may be needed. I just left it up while inside. Other than that, the camera is great. It took a little practice and trial and error, but after about 45 min, I had it down. I can definitely recommend this camera.",

After spending hours online reading reviews I decided on the this camera and I am SO glad I did. My top criteria were for a camera that would have high quality pictures, great zoom, and ease of use. The camera is easy to use, takes minimal set-up (which you can link to your phone and do all of the set up on the app on your phone) and it takes gorgeous pictures. I tested the camera out before we left, using different types of modes and playing with the zoom and on our trip we got some phenomenal pictures (it helps the subject is one of the most beautiful places in the US). I took about 200 pictures and the battery life still shows as full and only two pictures came out blurry (both were of deer that moved at the last second). The zoom is incredible as well. I zoomed pretty far with the picture of the sailboat and it turned out beautifully.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this Nikon Coolpix B500 Digital Camera for my 15 year old granddaughter. She had expressed an interest in photography and been using an old digital point and shoot that we had given her several year earlier. She felt limited by the point and shoot's image quality and lack of features.Since opening this on Christmas 2022, she has been making some amazing photographs. She really has an eye for subject matter and composition. The camera lens is amazingly sharp, so her pictures easily stand up to enlargement many times over. The zoom is so good she has taken excellent pictures of the moon where the craters are clearly visible. She has even done some macro photography with this camera, so it's very versatile.One thing I don't like about it, and it's a personal preference, is that it does not allow for interchangeable lenses. Fortunately, as I said, the lens on it is amazingly sharp, so for most situations, it will work well. I just like having options. This camera also works with SnapBridge, a Nikon software program for it's cameras. The camera doesn't have all the bells and whistles of my D850, but it's only a fraction of the price, and for what you pay, you get an excellent beginner camera.",

I'd been so frustrated lately trying to find a simple point-and-shoot that wasn't overloaded with gimmicky features. I used to be a professional photographer and I'd always used Canon equipment (my first was a 1981 AE-1 Program), but lately I've been thoroughly disappointed with the Canon point-and-shoot cameras I've tried. They rely WAY too much on wi-fi and Bluetooth features and tons of onboard software that is buggy, slow, and frequently nonfunctional. I don't need any of that--give me a camera that's geared toward gorgeous photos and simple controls, and just a USB cable for download. (This camera does use Nikon's Snapbridge app, which I have not set up because I don't care.) This is my first Nikon, and all I can say is, what took me so long? It not only takes stunning photos but is a work of art in and of itself. Could not be happier at this price point.",

                "reviewText": "This camera is perfect - HOWEVER they say in the product details \"Batteries: 1 Lithium ion batteries required.\" which is FALSE. Had I known that I would not have bought the camera as it uses either 4 AA Alkaline batteries or4 AA Lithium batteries or 4 Rechargeable Ni-MH batteries and we have to carry one or two extra sets for back up which makes a lot of batteries to carry. I am keeping the camera because it is a very good camera but I am disappointed by the false advertisement. Now I will have to go buy extra batteries as the ones supplied with the camera do not last as long as Lithium ion batteries which I always had in all my previous cameras. But I do recommend this camera if you do not mind carrying the extra batteries, as for the rechargeable charger....very expensive and rechargeable batteries lose their strength even if you do not use them so not recommended.",
