I tried it in my home and was able to find cameras and Wi-Fi very easily. I tried it in my hotel room, and I wasn\u2019t able to find anything, so I felt very confident that there was nothing present that was spying on me. There is also a useful flashlight attached that is very handy for looking into dark spots.",
