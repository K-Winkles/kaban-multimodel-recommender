You do have to set the flash each time if using it in darker areas. These are great inexpensive cameras for all purposes. They are great to have in your glove compartment in the event of an accident. In the rare cases of disputes, photos of license plates can be used in court except digital photos, which can be altered. A film photo cannot.I\u2019ve noticed from the reviews that a lot of people buy these for wedding guests. I purchased a block of these cameras specifically for the LAMP program in downtown Los Angeles. These cameras are given to the homeless, primarily on Skid Row with chronic mental illness or developmental disabilities. It\u2019s an art project to help these citizens.The price can\u2019t be beaten and the quality is just as good as a regular digital camera.",
