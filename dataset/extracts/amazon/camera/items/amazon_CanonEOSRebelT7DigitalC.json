                "reviewText": "I am a complete beginner to photography. I thought the item picture was a bit misleading. I would rather have seen the item pic without the lense so I didn't think I was getting two different lenses. But that's my own mistake. I think it takes good pictures in auto mode. I've tried taking pictures in other modes and they are blurry. I've had the camera for maybe two weeks and I still haven't figured the camera out yet. I didn't like the extra battery charger because I thought it was hard getting the battery out. I've only tried once though. The photo software are downloads and not the actually CD, which is fine, but I didn't know that when I ordered. So, overall, I like the camera. I think it takes good pictures if you know what you are doing. I am coming from a point and shoot camera so I think it'll take me some time to figure it out. It is for beginners, but you have to learn how to take pictures in other modes besides auto. Inside a building, the photos are a little dark, but like I said, it's probably something I'm doing wrong. I would recommend this camera to beginners but just be prepared to put the work in to learn how the camera functions work. If you just want to stick with auto mode, then you can take nice pictures right away. So, it's a nice camera for beginners and it gets the job done. I did receive a broken lense, (the telephoto one) and the company replaced it pretty fast. So, I'm happy with my purchase and look forward to learning how to make my pictures look nicer.A side note, if you want to buy an external flash, this camera will not work will 3rd party flashes. The clip on the hot shoe was removed and you can only use Canon flashes. Which I don't like. I had to send a flash back.",
