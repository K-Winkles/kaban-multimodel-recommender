The 1440p video quality is crystal clear, even in low light thanks to the Color Night Vision feature. The person, pet, and vehicle detection is spot on, providing an extra layer of security.,I love the flexibility of using both local and cloud storage options. The 2-way audio is clear, allowing me to communicate effectively through the camera.Setting it up was a breeze, and the price point is unbeatable for the features it offers. Highly recommend this camera for anyone looking for a reliable and affordable security solution!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased these cameras to have them indoors continuously recording in order to see what my 2 cats do when I am sleeping or not home. Thus, night vision is an important requirement. The night vision on this camera is extremely detailed even in near pitch black.Another positive is allowing local recording to a microSD card. Many cameras have subscriptions or cloud based services, which I didn\u2019t want. The storage limit for the microSD card is 512GB.Lastly, the app is great too. Easy to navigate, easy to set up the cameras, easy to playback the footage and download it.If I had one gripe, I would say I wish the microSD card storage limit was higher, such as 1GB or more. This would allow for months and months of continuous recording at 2K.",

I have all the camera\u2019s loaded with Micro SD Cards.3. I wish TP-Link had a window mount for this round camera. I purchased a square WYZe silicon mount and this camera fits in their mount with a little trimming.4. I\u2019m all in with TP-Link for camera security, I\u2019ll wait and see how well the cameras hold up to Arizona heat!5. I hope they design a wired doorbell camera, they have a battery doorbell but not good reviews. Only wired doorbell is their KASA brand. I purchased it but it is not very good. I would like them to introduce a dual camera wired doorbell like EUFy.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using 3 of this model camera for quite some time and absolutely love it. Whether for inside or outside, this works so good. The pet, line crossing, glass breakage, vehicle, etc detection is surprisingly accurate. The picture quality is just as good if not better than cameras 4x the price. I have used many models (don't want to list them all here, but trust me, you'd know the names) and this stands up to any of them; if not surpassing the functionality and picture quality.The only thing I don't like is that there is no computer/browser interface; it's all mobile. Granted, you can cast to a tv or device on a computer to view video, but it's all driving off your mobile device.Other than that, I absolutely love these and am switching all my monitoring to this company.Oh, one last thing, the motion detection is extremely sensitive, if a fly goes by it, you'll get a motion alert. I turned off general motion alerts and only alert based off animals, people, vehicles, and line crossings and it's great ... and my internal camera is set for glass breakage.",

                "reviewText": "The ability to move this type of camera around to various spots is a feature I much use. This particular one has a magnetic bottom and a provided steel plate that may be attached to any surface by screws and the camera mounted to it. The camera is powered by a USB A to C Power cord which requires a USB A power wall charger/adapter.In looking for a 4th Tapo camera I noticed this new model with great reviews from Tech Sources. I can not be more pleased with the quality of the picture. The Night Vision is top notch.I place this in a bay window pointing outward so a power plug is reachable and it sits flat on the surface. Some exterior mounting could be of concern, particularly if it is under low eaves, or otherwise within reach. It seems this could be an easy one to walk off with.None the less, ease of connection and top quality picture make this a big winner for me in the security camera category.I also added the Tapo Care that is offered adding 4 cameras to the plan.works well.",

I had to take this to work and use their Wi-Fi (I had all 5 bars of service there) just to get the camera added to my account and then after that it was having pairing issues. A few resets later and finally got everything to work.Gripes aside, once you have this connected, it's pretty user friendly. The picture isn't as clear as the advertisement makes it seem but you can still see most the details on items. Has a impressively wide view range too and the 2-way audio is a great feature. Right now I have this on the fire place mantle to monitor the interior while I'm away but if it's still working this good in a few weeks, I might even get one for the outside.Just don't be in a rush to use this once you get it...",

Innerhalb weniger Minuten war die Kamera einsatzbereit, und die Verbindung mit meinem WLAN-Netzwerk verlief problemlos.Die Bildqualit\u00e4t ist beeindruckend scharf und klar. Egal, ob es Tag oder Nacht ist, die Tapo C110 liefert gestochen scharfe Bilder und hochaufl\u00f6sende Videos. Die Infrarot-Nachtsichtfunktion ist besonders beeindruckend und sorgt daf\u00fcr, dass ich auch bei schwachem Licht oder v\u00f6lliger Dunkelheit klare Aufnahmen habe.Die Bewegungserkennungsfunktion ist \u00e4u\u00dferst pr\u00e4zise. Die Kamera sendet sofort Benachrichtigungen auf mein Smartphone, wenn sie eine Bewegung erkennt. Dies gibt mir ein gro\u00dfes Ma\u00df an Sicherheit und erm\u00f6glicht es mir, meine Umgebung zu \u00fcberwachen, auch wenn ich nicht zu Hause bin.Die Tapo-App ist intuitiv und benutzerfreundlich. Von dort aus kann ich live auf die Kamera zugreifen, Aufnahmen ansehen und sogar mit der Zwei-Wege-Audiofunktion kommunizieren. Die Cloud-Speicheroption bietet zus\u00e4tzlichen Komfort und Sicherheit f\u00fcr meine Aufnahmen.Die kompakte Gr\u00f6\u00dfe der Kamera erm\u00f6glicht es mir, sie nahezu \u00fcberall in meinem Zuhause zu platzieren, und das moderne, unauff\u00e4llige Design passt gut zu meiner Einrichtung.Insgesamt bin ich \u00e4u\u00dferst zufrieden mit der TP-Link Tapo C110 WLAN IP Kamera.
