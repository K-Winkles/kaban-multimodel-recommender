                "reviewText": "I really like the camera, easy set up and overall good image quality. But there are some things that could be improved:1. The need for a subscription after some time was not clearly described in the listing. The camera still works and records to the SD memory, but after a few weeks, it won't allow you to remotely playback recorded video accessed through notifications.2. Motion detection could be refined, as I sometimes receive a notification even when turning on a light. I'm unsure if this is intended, but it's unsettling to get a motion detection notification when simply turning on room lights.3. Night vision is quite good, but it would be nice to have an option to adjust its intensity, similar to how you adjust the settings when taking a picture with your phone. Initially placed in front of a window, when night came, the night vision activated the IR LEDs, revealing nothing more than its reflection. The good thing is that you can change the night vision mode to normal, and it still adjusts the ISO to try and capture what it can in low-light conditions.",

I'm using it to monitor a family member with dementia. It would be great as a puppy cam and for security when you're not home. For me, the only downside is the size. I have located it where you are less likely to see it but there are smaller cameras on the market. They don't pan or tilt and it was worth the size for me.",

                "reviewText": "Decent video quality. Not very detail over 4 mts (3.3 ft) but I guess this is not the purpose of these cameras.Setting up the camera are kinda problematic due to some steps that aren't very clear (maybe it was my smartphone that is 3 years old) but to pair the camera to your WiFi network the app creates a secondary WiFi signal and my phone did not change automatically to the latter network. I did not realize of this step (my mistake) and wasted almost an hour trying to figure out why the camera could not connect to my WiFi. Besides that problem and some minor privacy settings that are weird, the camera works just fine. They record and notifies quite fast of any movement or activity in their surroundings.Sound quality is not something to praise but is functional, as well as the mic (yes, one can have a conversation with a person in the other end). Function wise, there are nice settings like turning off the red dot, framing specific parts of the room to quickly turn the camera to frame that specific place, automatic detection, turn on/off the alarm, face detection and so on. Feature-wise is very complete.One downside might be the storage. If you don't buy the cloud service or do not have an SD, the camera will not record any activity by itself. It will still notifies you about any movement but It will be not possible to see what had happened. So at least get a 64GB SD card if you are not interested in cloud storage.Overall, the camera is a solid choice (in any light conditions) and app is really feature pack to customize it to your liking.",

                "reviewText": "I thought I would give this a try and for the price that I got them at when they were on sale, I can't really complain. I needed a camera to record 24/7 without a cloud service. Although a cloud service is available with these which make it a GREAT option to get these cameras. So I put in a 128Gb card and set it up and away we go. I set it up on motion tracking and it works really well. I had to stop the tons of notifications I was getting but is a handy feature when I need it. It even tracks the cats wandering all around. Overall I am happy with the camera but if I had to nit pick at something it would be a couple of things. It tracks movement on the TV, so the camera often watching TV instead of the people in the room. Not a deal breaker. The other bug for me is that when it tracks and follows something to a certain point, after a while the camera resets to a position if it doesn't sense someone. The problem is it often sets to a position or a fixed setting that I can't seem to control. This one annoys me somewhat because the camera can completely miss someone coming into the room. Still working on this one. But overall I am happy with the cameras and the ease of setting it up with the app. I have actually purchased several more of these. And for that reason I'm in.",
