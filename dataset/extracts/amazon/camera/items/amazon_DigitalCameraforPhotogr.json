I wanted to give this camera a fair shot and a real review, so I went into the settings and made sure everything was set to the highest quality. The video was definitely 4K as described. I even loved the Timelapse as well as light feature (you can turn flash on for video to use in low lighting).I did NOT however love the sound. After reaching out regarding this issue, I sent a sample video and learned that the mic on my unit was faulty. I was offered a new unit abs in less than a week it arrived.The sand great video quality but now with the sound to match. Please keep in mind that the playback audio from the camera itself isn\u2019t great, but when uploaded to a computer or transferred to a phone, it sounds great.With such great quality AND customer service, not only will I be recommending this camera, I will be giving away a few as gifts.Very happy with my purchase.",

It\u2019s dizzying to watch.I\u2019ve spent easily 8 hours learning this camera and feel pretty frustrated to have wasted all that time making myself an expert on it. It\u2019s not worth keeping with the failure to focus.Also, the edge of the viewer field is not the edge of what is captured. So I had to put small lines on the viewfinder to keep track of where it actually cut off,I had a lot of hope for this camera. I\u2019d read the sound wasn\u2019t great but was using a Mike so that was fine.I\u2019m pretty disappointed. I\u2019d be mad if I weren\u2019t so out of energy from trying to set this shot up all day and in the end failing not due to me, but due to the CAMERA\u2019s FAILURE.",

It's fairly LIGHT, and yet STURDY. Good feel.Those batteries do seem a bit tiny, though. It will be interesting to see over time how well they hold up on the job, to ensure that photo opportunities aren't lost, when the power goes out!(Of course there's that option to carry and external power block and plug in the camera while on the go)The collection of accessories with the camera are good. And that Macro Lens is an attractive add.All in all, we're very excited to have a new tool in the photography tool belt.Promises to be a GREAT one! : )",
