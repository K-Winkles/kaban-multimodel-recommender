                "reviewText": "I wanted to try a security camera but didn't want to spend a fortune since it isn't something I HAD to have. After browsing a bunch of options this one seemed to have all the things I was looking for at a price I was comfortable with incase I decided we didn't need it. We finally got it put up and everything works perfectly so far. The picture quality is pretty good, you cab either sign up for their cloud service or use an SD card, has a light and an alarm you can use through the app. The camera was super easy to install. The app is pretty user friendly as well. This camera has been working well for us that we will probably buy a couple more.",

I downloaded the app very easy to use. I have not been able to share the access with my husband so right now I am the only one who can access the account. When I have him log in with my information it signs me out. Other than that it\u2019s very easy to use and the battery holds up pretty good. Will be buying a second one soon.",

                "reviewText": "I have an Abode home security system. I bought 3 indoor/outdoor cameras to be used outdoors with the package, but I mistakenly assumed the Abode I/O cameras were rechargeable battery-powered cameras like the Abode doorbell camera. Nope. They have to be connected by USB-C cable to an electrical outlet. I should've read the fine print.So, I needed an extra outdoor camera and decided to buy this one after reading multiple reviews. I believe I misplaced the instruction booklet after I first opened it, but no matter. There was a QR code to scan which took me to the Vico Home app download. The app has the installation instructions, but this is pretty simple to install.The Vico Home app also guides you through pairing the camera with your Wi-Fi and set up. I cannot say enough times how much easier it was to install this camera and connect it through the app than the Abode cameras and devices were. The Abode was a giant pain in the butt to connect devices through their app. Every device was a struggle, some devices didn't work, and others wouldn't work until they had firmware updates. Even then, it was still a slow process (up to half an hour) and took 3-5 attempts (one took over 10 attempts!) before it would work.This app is highly intuitive and simple to use (MUCH, MUCH SIMPLER THAN THE ABODE APP), and I had my camera connected and running within 3 minutes. I can delete unwanted video so much easier than Abode. It has a select all feature that allows you to delete all video clips at once. This camera has an alarm, and the notification that detects motion has a simple link to click to activate the alarm without having to search through the app to do so. Or, you can set your camera's alarm to go off for 5-10-15 seconds anytime motion is detected. You can talk to & hear the other person. You can even turn on a light to illuminate a dark area to record it to view live. You can set the camera to black and white mode but it will switch to color when the light is activated. Or you can leave it in color mode all the time. I leave one camera in B&W mode because the area is dark and you can't see it very well on live view without turning on the light when it is in color mode. That said, I prefer the color mode when recording people so it doesn't wash out their faces like B&W can do. The idea is to give the police good video of a burglar's face. It's hard to do that in B&W mode.My only complaint is the speaker on the camera isn't very loud so they may not hear you clearly through the camera when you speak. I would also prefer it be 5GHz-capable since I have two 5 GHz channels and only one 2.4 GHz. But it works well regardless.Overall, this is a great camera system and I plan to buy 3 more for all 4 sides of the house. I may update this review later to report on the camera battery life.UPDATE: I bought 4 more of these cameras for my home's exterior, plus an Allweviee PTZ camera here on Amazon that uses the same Vico Home app. I'm sure all these cameras come from the same factory in China. Anyway, I now have full coverage around my house.The Vico Home app had the PTZ controls for the camera as soon as I installed it. It also allows for multiple presets, so I can make the PTZ go where I want it in one tap.Ultimately, I would like to integrate all these cameras with the Abode system, if possible. I haven't yet played around with the Abode system enough to know if I can, although I doubt these cameras will integrate. Regardless, it still alerts me to the exterior motion around my house and does it more rapidly than my Abode doorbell camera does. I can activate the camera's alarm with the quick touch of a link in the app's motion detected notification. I can activate my home alarm remotely with the push of a button if needed, and it's monitored. The process is pretty seamless in spite of this camera being on a separate app.So far, the first camera I set up still shows a full charge 12 days later. My Abode doorbell cam is down to 81% during the same time. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase and I would recommend this to anyone.UPDATE 11/27/23: I'm still very satisfied with this camera. But I want anyone who reads this teview to know, the 2-way talk function is mostly useless. It's not just this camera; it's the same with most cameras I've used in my security system. The speakers are not loud enough, even on full volume, indoors or especially outdoors. If you saw a criminal on your camera and you called out to them, they likely won't hear you no matter how loudly you speak/yell into your phone. That feature is worthless. The siren is loud enough, but the speech function is not.",

Hang it anywhere and you will not have to worry about cables and running anything inside your home. Ours is about 25 feet away from the router, so not real sure about distance, but the reception is perfect! Speaker isn't the loudest, but the siren and lights should scare off any intruders, and I mean really, how many times will i ever need to speak to someone at my door. The free option for saving videos is good enough for me and the motion sensors work well. Caught a raccoon getting into my trash cans in the back yard! Great camera for a first camera, if you are looking to dip your toes in the water, I highly recommend this option!",
