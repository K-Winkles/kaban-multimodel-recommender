I bought a 2 pack and they're both the same so I know it isn't just a one off problem. There's no adjustment for contrast, at least in the app. The object detection works but that's pretty useless if you can't identify the vehicle or person.I'll be sending these back unless I can find a way to improve the image qualityEDIT: The washout was caused by the anti-flicker being set to \"other\". Setting it to 60Hz fixed it and the cameras are working great now",
