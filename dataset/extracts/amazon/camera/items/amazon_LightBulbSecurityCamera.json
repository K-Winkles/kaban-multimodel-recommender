To install I had to replace my front porch light fixture to accommodate the camera, which I expected. But, I could only program one of the two cameras and only after multiple tries. But every time there was movement, a bug flying across the camera, or a car from my neighbors driving by I would get a notification. Sometimes four to six false alarms each night, even with the sensitivity set as low as possible. Moving the camera from the phone app is very twitchy. Sometimes it reverses after I move it. Bothersome. There is not a lot of support that was helpful on the website. I regret buying them to be honest.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Very Tiny View Area",
                "reviewText": "Pros: Very Inexpensive. DC Adapters. Pan Tilt or Zoom from app. Can set to auto track motion. Very easy set up. Can customize Alerts. Can view playback recordings from SD card, or from optional cloud account. Decent video clarity. No adapter needed for the micro usb slot.Cons: Tiniest view area I\u2019ve ever seen. Instructions state it supports up to 128 gig SD card, but I didn\u2019t see that in the description. The 256 gig SD card seemed to be OK, since I was able to view recordings the first night. But the second day, it shows No Recordings. Previous recordings are gone. I won\u2019t use the 2nd one until I have time to Google/YouTube and figure it all out. But if you\u2019re tech savvy and only need to view a narrow section of a room, like a crib or pet crate, then this is great.",
