I love the square prints - very retro vibe, and looks to be good quality (for an instant - you should know what type of prints you are getting.)I really thought these new instant cameras would be able to re-print a photo. I was wrong. Maybe I just don\u2019t understand how these work - this is not reflected in my rating. Just a wish.Pros:Cool styling and good buildCool printsEasy to usePortableCons:Seems a digital device like this should be able to re-print photosBase order does not come with filmFilm is rather expensiveThe viewfinder is a bit tough to use with its placement - but does the job",
