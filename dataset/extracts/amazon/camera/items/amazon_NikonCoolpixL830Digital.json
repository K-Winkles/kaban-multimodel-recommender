Everything's been so easy, even downloading the photos to my computer and Nikon is so supportive and provided me with a website to download pictures. It's just been a joy!

I love hockey and taking sports pictures and this camera does that beautifully!Also I use this for my own modeling purposes. I set it on a tripod and put it on the self timer and it take gorgeous model professional looking photos!! I LOVE IT!!! I did however drop it while ice skating and the lens has a bad scratch on it, but that was my fault BUT it still works and takes good photos the bottom corner is just a bit blurry now. ALSO I suggest buying rechargable batteries. I bought a 4 pack of double A's that recharge for $20 on here.",

                "reviewText": "Positives:This is a pretty good little camera, a bargain for the price. The camera body is reasonably small and has a great optical zoom range - that is its best feature (tied with the plum body color, if you ask my wife). As with any camera, skip the digital zoom - you may as well keep the entire image and crop later as you see fit.The image stabilization on videos was a pleasant surprise. Camera movements are effectively eased into, causing them to smooth out without distorting the video or causing unnatural motion like with some video site's more aggressive software stabilization. It does not remove movement to produce a perfectly still shot, nor should it - get a tripod or a camera stabilizer if that is what you need. However, the results are quite good and feel rather natural and relaxed.I have not had a chance to test the high speed video.Negatives:The camera is slow...that is to be expected at this price point, but it does border on frustrating at crucial, time sensitive moments.I have yet to figure out how to reliably get the camera to focus on the correct object. I may be overlooking a setting somewhere.The flash does not have an auto-release in low-light situations or at least an on-screen indicator for the user that a flash is suggested - that would have been a nice touch.Technically, 16MP is good by today's standards - but because of the small sensor used, the images it takes are not terribly crisp at full resolution. This is not uncommon - but you should expect the 16MP image to record a very good 8MP image or an excellent 4MP image.",

At first the user was a little apprehensive about how well it would work because it is refurbished. After some prodding she went ahead and used it and found it to be the best camera the agency has had in years! It is easy to use and maintain and takes great pictures whether it be from prints to uploading on the internet. Glad we decided to keep it.",
