But it needs to be plugged in all the time for power supply. Why does the connection failed? Firstly, pls note that this camera only connects to 2.4ghz wifi; Secondly, pls ensure the indicator light is flashing blue and red slowly, which means the camera is ready for connection. The detailed instruction pls refer to the user manual. Do I have to subscribe to cloud storage? No, this is optional. Each user enjoys a 30-day free trial of cloud storage, which can help you know more advanced features of our camera. You can then decide whether or not to subscribe. Does it connect to 5g? No. It only connects with 2.4ghz wifi. Most routers supports 2.4ghz and 5ghz at the same time. You can check the router settings first. Why there is nothing after inserting a SD card? If you insert a micro SD card (up to 128GB) but no memory card storage setting, it's because the card is not recognized by the camera. You can format the card to FAT 32 or exFAT; try another SD card; restart the camera and update its firmware.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Wans view Security Camera, and it has exceeded my expectations in every way. This IP Camera is a game-changer for anyone looking to enhance home security while keeping an eye on their loved ones, pets, or even just monitoring your home remotely. The 2K resolution provides clear video quality, allowing me to see every detail with precision. The night vision feature is exceptional, providing a clear view even in complete darkness. This is especially comforting for those late-night check-ins. The two-way audio is a standout feature that adds an extra layer of convenience. Whether I'm checking in on my pets or communicating with family members at home, the clarity of the audio is impressive. It's like being there in person. Setting up the camera was a breeze, thanks to its seamless integration with Alexa. I can easily control and monitor the camera using voice commands, making it incredibly user-friendly. The compatibility with both TF cards and cloud storage offers flexibility in recording and storing footage. One of the standout features for me is the motion detection capability. The camera sends instant alerts to my phone whenever there is any unusual activity, providing peace of mind and a sense of security. The Wansview app is intuitive and user-friendly, allowing me to access live footage, review recordings, and customize settings effortlessly. The camera's ability to rotate and cover a wide area ensures that no corner of the room is left unmonitored. The Wansview Security Camera is a top-notch choice for anyone seeking a reliable, high-quality indoor camera. Its impressive features, easy setup, and integration with smart home systems make it a must-have for those prioritizing home security and peace of mind. I highly recommend the Wansview IP Camera for its stellar performance and outstanding value.",

                "reviewText": "This camera works well. I got it to watch my cat while I'm away at work. The setup took about 2 minutes, but you'll have to use their app. They have a paid version with a cloud system that can store video and picture data. With the free version you can move the camera, talk, listen, take pictures to your camera roll, and watch in day or night.It features two way audio. The audio from the speakers is a bit low, but the speaker is pretty good, as it can capture even faint noises.The camera quality is alright.This is a reliable camera that gets the job done for a good price.",

                "reviewText": "** updateI\u2019ve been having some issues connecting to the camera when I am away from home. I did purchase the memory card and I\u2019ve been getting a weird message when trying to review video , again when I am away from home. Trying to resolve. Says a need to have my phone and camera in a LAN. Not sure what this means. Will update again if I figure out solution.** UpdateI was told that you can only view memory card motion recordings when you are connected to the same WiFi network that the camera is on.I\u2019ve had some issues with the camera randomly dropping my network or needing to be reset a few times. Not sure why this is happening. Also I decided to try the 30 free cloud trial. I will update with that experience. I have 3 cameras and the one that had a memory card in it didn\u2019t not want to stay connected to the cloud. When I took the card out that issue resolved.I posted pictures of what was in the box as well as a few screen shots. Also a picture of the correct app to look for. My husband downloaded the wrong app and it took us a while to figure out why he couldn\u2019t connect. But after that it was simple. I purchased this camera as a baby monitor and also to check in on our dogs when we are out. I haven\u2019t had the baby yet so we are just testing it out to make sure it works good before the baby comes. My husband is in the army and will be deployed overseas the first 13 months after the baby is born. This will let him view live video , take screen shots and hear his child while he is away.It gives you the option to purchase a monthly cloud subscription for recording. Or you can purchase a micro SD card which is what I did. You do not need to do either. It still works and records 10 second clips of motion. But that has limited storage without the cloud or card. I have included a picture of the hardware for mounting and the slot for the SD card on the camera body itself. I plan on adding a second and third camera. You can add up to 4 devices.Pros:+ Setting up the first time is quick (5 min for both software and hardware) with their easy-to-follow instructions. (After we used correct app \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f)+ Camera hardware is well-built, good-looking, and small in size which I like.+ The wide-angle lens is the best I\u2019ve seen in terms of clarity and coverage.+ Crisp & clear images and videos - day and night - surprisingly good quality.+ Excellent audio & mic. You will get feed back if you open the camera with sound and you are close to it. Also don\u2019t place near a fan.+ The Wansview cloud android & iPhone phone apps are easy to set up, easy to use and to configure. I have an iPhone , husband has an android. Both apps work good.+ Upon detecting motions, the camera sends me alerts on my phone, and 10-sec video clips in the mobile app. We have dogs so we turned this feature off or we\u2019d get constant alerts. You can do this via the app.+ Allows you to use a SD card for more recording capabilities.+ Allows the main user ( the person who first sets up camera with phone app) to send an invite to up to 3 other users who will need to download app, make an account and then will be able to view the camera as well.+ We have both tested out the connection on the app while we weren\u2019t home ( he\u2019s in another state right now) and neither have had an issue connecting or viewing the camera.+ Has a feature on app that allows you to set multiple favorite positions which I love. So if you are moving the angle around you can hit a potion and it will automatically go back to it.Cons: (only one so far)- No audio-detection alert capability (only motion-detection). Maybe this will change in the future )Overall for price and quality and ease of use I would definitely recommend this camera.",
