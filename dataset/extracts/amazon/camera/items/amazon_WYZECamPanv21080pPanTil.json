Also enjoy the 2-way talk feature if I ever need to say something into the camera. It\u2019s also affordable which is an added plus!! Will definitely be buying more from Wyze cameras!!",

Also the 360 spin captures everything! Great for parents who work and have older kids can see what your kids are up to and can talk directly to them!! I definitely recommend this set!! I feel more at peace knowing what is going on in my home!",

                "reviewText": "This camera has great picture quality, night vision and is really affordable, but unfortunately it's cheap quality and doesn't last more than a few weeks of use. We bought our first one as a pet camera, but after a smooth setup and two weeks of use, the light went red and never reconnected. We reached out to amazon and were sent a replacement. Within a few weeks of having that one set up, it did the same thing. We were made aware on our first replacement that wyze has a warranty guarantee, so instead of reaching out to amazon we figured we'd go straight to wyze. Our first support request went no where, and we missed Amazon's return window during this time, so we just stopped using the camera for a couple months hoping a break and a reset would help bring it back to life. Nope - it never reconnected regardless of trying every troubleshooting method we could find online, and our same issue seems to be common based on what we found researching. We reached out to support again, and this time got a quick response, but weren't offered any assistance in getting our camera back on. Instead, we were given a gift card to buy yet another one directly from them. This would have been fine except it shows the company doesn't even stand by the longevity of their devices. Further, they only reimbursed for the cost of the camera, no tax. Shipping costs $5.99 as well, so we ended up having to pay more $ just to get our replacement camera- regardless of their warranty claims of a guarantee. We needed a camera set up asap, so we ordered, but my expectations are incredibly low that it will actually work, and we plan to replace it with a higher quality camera in the next few months. It's sad because I really was excited about this company and how they were making home security accessible, but this camera in particular is junk and I am disappointed in their handling of our issue.",

No more avoiding my calls or texts on his day off, no mercy!\u2022 Great customer support and warranty! When my derpy idiot dog knocked the camera down 4 days after we got it, the image turned magenta. A simple chat with support via the phone app resulted in Wyze Cam sending a new unit, free of charge!Cons:\u2022 Does not come with much in the way of instructions\u2022 Does not come with any sort of mount or anythingI can\u2019t really say anything bad about this camera so far. We have been very pleased and ended up purchasing other units for various parts of our property to enhance our security.Please enjoy this brief clip of my derpy dog, Demolition Dilly, annihilating the camera.",
