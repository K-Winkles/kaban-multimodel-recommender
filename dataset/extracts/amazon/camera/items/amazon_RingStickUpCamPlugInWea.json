The setup was easy, no sync modules, just put the camera up and connect it. The Ring app is great. I purchased the Ring plug in cameras. They have long and even really long cords included. The camera mounts are nice too. So glad we went with Ring. AWESOME. I highly recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "4/8/20 Update:This is the final update. The firmware upgrade resolved my issues. It is working fine. So I upgraded my review to 5 stars. Here is the bulleted summary. The original review, and the previous update, appear below unedited.* Excellent support. They reached out to me to help me when they saw my original review. Had that not happened, I would have just sent this back.* You cannot flip the video if you mount this upside down (like hanging it below a roof overhang, for example). It must be mounted right side up. I don\u2019t know why, as the indoor cameras can be mounted either way.* The integration with other ring cameras in the app is excellent. The upgrades to the app that occurred recently allow one to set \u201cmodes\u201d and enable or disarm various cameras in various situations. Handy.* Unlike the indoor cameras, this outdoor camera has limited control over motion detection zones. You can activate three different set zones, but you cannot draw a region like you can with the indoor camera. The motion detection works fine, but I\u2019d rather be able to activate a particular area as opposed to picking from set regions.* The firmware upgrade was problematic, and was the source of the issues I had. I don\u2019t know why, but with the support help I got, it updated fine and resolved my issues. If you get one of these, and when you install it tells you it needs a firmware upgrade, make sure that happens. You can ensure it does by seeing the blue light on the front flash on and off after you set it up (and the update starts). Despite repeated attempts on my end, that did not happen until I was on the phone with support. The update does take a while, so be patient. But if the blue light is not flashing, try power cycling the camera until it does.Bottom line: recommended.4/6/20 Update: This is an update to my previous review. This is still a work in progress, but progress has been made. I increased my rating to 3 stars, but will revise it again after I am done testing. After posting my original review (below, unchanged), a Ring support person saw it and emailed me. Which I did not expect. We arranged a call, and he helped me get the software update applied (which, for some reason, was never properly applied). This appeared to clear the issues. I had moved the camera indoors (to eliminate any network issues on my end) and tested it all weekend, and had nothing but problems. I convinced myself through that testing that the camera was defective and figured I would return it for a replacement. However, now that the software update was applied, it seems to be working fine. I moved it back to its outdoor location (which weakens the wifi signal) and am testing it now. Hopefully this solved the problem. However, kudos to the Ring support to help with this. They reached out to me and the person I spoke with was quite knowledgeable. Very helpful. I am confident at this point that, if this camera does turn out to be defective, that a replacement will work fine. Hopefully this problem is solved for good, though. I will update this further after more testing.The original review appears below, unedited.---This camera (the stick up outdoor camera, powered by plug in) was completely useless. I have three other indoor ring cameras which all work fine. This one was flaky from setup. Like my other cameras, it setup easily with the app. I connected it and set it up indoors initially (the installation was to be outside). Once connected, it immediately wanted to do an update. Fine. I wait. No flashing lights, nothing. I wait and wait. After a lengthy period of time, I decided it was done. I continued through the setup and did a live view. It was very sluggish, but it worked. I figured, cool, it\u2019s ready. So I unplugged it and went outside with an extension cord, plugged it back in, and started fooling around with location while using live view. Was working fine (however, it was here where I discovered there is no video inversion for this particular model if you want to hang it upside down - this is not true for the indoor stickup cameras, so beware of that). I leave it plugged in and sitting out side, and I return indoors to get something (I actually went inside to confirm via the internet that, yes, this camera really cannot be mounted upside down). I go back outside and try to reconnect to live view and it refuses. Claims poor connection. Complains about my phone, complains about the camera. Nothing changed. Not even the location. I had just spent several minutes up and down a ladder and screwing around with placement, all with live view. No problem. I finally decide to just remove the device and re-install it. So I do (this time depressing the button inside to put the camera in setup mode). I eventually get the same message, in the same place in the installation process, about needing an update. So I do the same thing again. This time I am doing all of this outside, because that\u2019s where everything is now. Eventually, after (I think) the update is complete (it\u2019s not like it tells you) I try live view. Doesn\u2019t work. Well, it sort of worked. It worked initially, then when I tried to go back to it, it would not reconnect again complaining about a poor connection. I finally decide to try this one more time. I delete it again, move it all inside to sit right next to the wifi access point. I redo the install again (delete the device, put the camera in setup mode, re-install as before). I again get the need to update message. This time I just let it sit there for a good 20 minutes so to make sure it installed the update (or thought it did). So here I am typing this, with the camera sitting on my desk. It is in live view but constantly stops, complains about a poor connection, and so on. When I pop in and out of live view, it takes quite a while to reconnect. All of my other cameras are nearly instant. But not this one. All on the same network. The upshot? I have no idea if I just happen to have a lemon here or what, but this thing is useless. It won\u2019t even work 4 ft from the wifi access hotspot. I can literally see it from where I am sitting. Every other device I have works fine, including other devices connected and sitting outside (an older security camera, a weather station, .... - all connected to the same network, the same wifi access hotspot). I am returning this today. Very disappointed since the other indoor ring cameras work so well.",

                "reviewText": "I have 5 stick up cameras and the door bell camera. All have held up well under the Texas heat and now the Texas cold. The online storage is good, a bit pricey, but good. I use the app on my phone almost always because it\u2019s the easiest to get quick views. As far as using on my laptop it\u2019s a pain in the butt. I have to signin all the time. The picture quality on the laptop is great though. I do recommend the Ring cameras because they are easy to install ( more work installing outside with power) and the pan tilt option is pretty good also. Like the rest of the Ring stuff - a bit pricy.",
