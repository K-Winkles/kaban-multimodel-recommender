That is why MoonPads uses 100% organic cotton and plant-plastic. We do not use chemicals or fragrances that compromise our health.",
            "100% BIODEGRADABLE - Planet over Profit. There are 1.8 billion menstruators in the world who have had very few options but to filling landfills (and waterways) with billions of tampons and pads each year. MoonPads is here to offer a better solution. Our pads will biodegrade over the course of one year, compared with conventional plastic pads which will take up to a thousand years to break down.",
            "BUY ONE & GIVE ONE - At MoonPads, we put people and planet over profit. MoonPads is the only pad company, that invests 100% of profit back into eradicating period poverty.

            "MoonPads does business differently. We are a multi-national, femme owned and operated social benefit business that sprouted up from a non-profit that addresses the intersectional issues of environmental sustainability, equity, and wellness. Our programs in Tibet dive into maternal child health, intimate partner violence and sexual wellness. We began by sharing education and pads to nomadic menstruators and girls who faced not only period stigma, but also zero access to supplies and healthcare."

The lack of applicator and oversized wrapper also means that these fit into even the smallest of bags, I can even fit one in my wallet!I also appreciate that for every box purchased, a box is donated to a woman in need, making me feel great about using the product and much more likely to purchase these in the future.All in all these are an excellent buy as long as you don't have a very heavy flow. 4/5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "These arrived quickly and well packaged but my mouth hit the floor when I seen the box was so tiny it could fit in my hand. I opened it to find these bullet shaped tightly wrapped tampons that require manual insertion. Now I\u2019m all for environmental friendly and clean products but without an applicator, this is not something that I will choose to use. They are difficult to insert and I find them rather uncomfortable as I don\u2019t feel I am able to get them placed well without an applicator. These do absorb well for light to medium flow and the string does seem to be effective when pulling it out. Due to the hands on experience, you will need to wash your hands before and after insertion and you will likely have some semblance of a mess which I prefer to avoid. The price is on par with similar products but I really feel that they should include at least 1 reusable applicator to make these a viable option for those who prefer one. Overall, as it is I am not a fan of this product but if they were to make some adjustments and include an applicator then this would be a good organic option. Wouldn\u2019t recommend to those who need or prefer an applicator to insert.",

She doesn\u2019t like to carry a purse and these actually fit in the lanyard wallet/coin purse she carries. She really likes how small these are. She also wears long nails so I was worried but she didn\u2019t have any problems using these. Since she\u2019s used to an applicator, I did have to tell her that she needs to wash her hands well and get under her nails before inserting the tampons. These are so easy to store and carry in a smaller size. She hasn\u2019t had any leaks and I like that they\u2019re clean and eco-friendly.",

                "reviewText": "These tampons are applicator-free. I get the desire to reduce plastic in the land fills, I really do. But I also really dislike using tampons without applicators. When my flow is heavy, it\u2019s HEAVY, and the amount of mess involved is just not acceptable to me on those days. So I use these on less-heavy days, and they\u2019re ok. They start out really tiny and expand once you\u2019ve put them in, so they\u2019re effective from that standpoint. In fact, that compact size is one thing I do like, as they\u2019re really easy to slip in a pocket or purse. And at least they\u2019re better than those silicone menstrual cups\u2014I tried one, and it was a horrible, messy nightmare. But, honestly, I probably won\u2019t get these again. Even a cardboard applicator is better than none at all, in my opinion.",

I love that they're organic cotton.I think these would be best for a tween or teen and probably lighter flow days.I hope this review helps and that you have a wonderful day!",
