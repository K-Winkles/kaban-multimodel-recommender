Not if I don't want anxiety every time I have to use one.Most of your big box retailers and drugstores only have the cardboard ones in the variety pack, if they have any at all these days. And then I'll have 1-2/3 of a box of tampons in sizes I'm never going to use.I'm hoping to be completely feral by the time the remaining world supply of cardboard applicator tampons runs out, because I am *not* converting to plastic.
