                "reviewText": "-First I want to say, read the product description ladies, these are non-applicator tampons. Most of the reviews that were less than 5 stars state it is because they don't have an applicator. That being said, they are my favorite ones I've found!-I switched to organic cotton and chemical free tampons about a year ago and am glad I did. I have had much less itching since switching.-While I like the idea of using a menstrual cup because it takes the waste created by feminine hygiene products to 0, I have tried using cups in the past and I just don't think they are for me.-So then I got to thinking, what else could I do to reduce waste created during my cycle and I remembered some tampons come applicator free. And ladies, why do we need an applicator anyway? I remember when I was 11 or 12 (I started menstruating at age 11) I asked my mom why one box of tampons was so much smaller than the other boxes on the isle and I remember her saying \"Well, they don't have an applicator.\" So I asked her, \"Well how do you get them in?\" And she responded, \"You use your finger,\" and made a face that seemed to say, \"ewww, gross.\". Well, one thing I noticed when I switched to organic cotton and chemical free tampons and that sometimes they tend to \"hang on\" to the applicator after inserted and when I pull out the applicator the tampon comes out with it. And what do you do in this situation? You use your finger to put it back in. So what is the point of the applicator if you are going to have to use your finger anyway? So for me this was an easy decision to switch to non-applicator tampons. They have so much less waste than traditional applicator tampons. The tampon itself seems a lot smaller but I think thats because it's shrink wrapped. Once it contacts moisture it expands to the same size as the applicator tampon.-All in all my hippie heart feels better knowing there is so much less waste with these tampons and I have not been bothered by the switch at all.",

I saw this brand online and gave it a try and am so happy I did as I like these more than OB. These are denser and stiffer, making them easier to use, and I do not feel them while in use. I'll be ordering more of these going forward.",

                "reviewText": "I am always looking for ways to reduce waste and plastic in my life. Menstrual products are an area that I\u2019ve struggled to find a good balance of performance/comfort and low environmental impact. Then along came Cora Tampons.First off the bat, they come in a tiny little box! Seriously so small! Even less waste. The tampons are easy to unwrap and are tiny themselves. I found the lack of an applicator to be a non-issue. It\u2019s easy to insert and no pinchy applicator creating more plastic waste. I\u2019ve found these to be the most comfortable tampons I\u2019ve used, ever. Not sure if it\u2019s the size or shape, but I can\u2019t feel these and I usually can other tampon brands and that\u2019s super uncomfortable. But not only are Cora tampons comfortable to use, I\u2019ve found the absorption to be better than the conventional big name tampon brands. Plus on top of all that, they\u2019re 100% organic cotton which I feel good about putting in my body and in my support of organic cotton production. These are my brand from now on!",

                "reviewText": "I had never used applicator-free tampons before these, so there is a bit of a learning curve. Once you get the hang of it, they\u2019re really easy to use. They are a bit harder or more dense than a normal tampon that comes in an applicator, but you can\u2019t feel that once you\u2019ve got it in. I love that these are so small and they\u2019re made from organic cotton so you\u2019re putting good material in your body. Also, save the planet & ditch those applicators! I like to use these on days where I have a lighter flow and I don\u2019t necessarily feel like using my menstrual cup.",
