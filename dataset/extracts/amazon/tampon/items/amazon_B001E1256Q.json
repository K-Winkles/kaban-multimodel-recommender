                "reviewText": "I have a Luna cup but sometimes I have ultra-sensitive days where I want nothing at all touching my lady bits. These tampons are for those days. No meticulously scrubbing hands like a surgeon about to operate, before folding a piece of round silicone into an origami swan and shoving it up my tender hoo-ha. No gritting my teeth while cramming an applicator-free hunk of compressed cotton into an angry orifice. I used to use the Natracare applicator-free tampons but then one day I was caught off guard without one. A co-worker gave me a conventional tampon with a plastic applicator and it went in so silky smooth and effortlessly that I ALMOST went back to using a chemical sh!+-filled brand. Thankfully Natracare makes their applicators with the soft-tip for easy insertion.My ONLY gripe is that 'dispatch' sometimes requires two hands because the applicator jams. I'm no engineer, but there's GOT to be a better release method than what the current design allows. I mean, it's essentially 2 very narrow nesting toilet paper tubes, and you push one into the other. The mechanism jams often enough that I'd rate these a 4 and conventional plastic applicators a 5 based on ease of use and sheer comfort. If tampons were cars, conventional plastic applicators would be Ferraris and Natracare applicators are Hyundais. Yes, both will get me from point A to B, but one will be a LOT more enjoyable of an experience! I'm giving Natracare 5 stars because I don't want baby sea turtles to choke on plastic tampon applicators. Natracare seems to be the only choice for an earth-friendly, chemical-free tampon with an applicator. It's a nearly perfect product and I've been buying from this company for years. The old design had no soft tip, so that's a HUGE improvement. Most of the time these work just fine. I get at least 1 'failure to launch' dud every month. I don't have to throw it away, but I have to take it out and give it an extra push to get started, then coax it back in. It's mildly uncomfortable, but it IS a first-world problem.",

                "reviewText": "This tampons really deserve 4 stars for performance, but I give them an extra star for being organic and chemical free. The regular absorbency is kind of lame to be honest, but maybe next time I need to try super. I really like the biodegradable applicator and that the applicator is not cardboard-like but feels more like plastic. They can be a little hard to insert but I think its worth the extra trouble. I guess my only real qualm is the wrappers are made of very crunchy noisey paper and not discrete at all for public bathrooms. I know some people adopt the \"we all do it, deal with it\" attitude but I'd rather not draw attention to myself! All in all, these are good and when bought in multipacks, not any less affordable than bleached tampons.",

They seem to absorb better than store brand because there is no rayon fiber and other things mixed in. So if you have sensitive skin or body these are good and the cardboard applicator doesn't scratch. Just one trick is to push the outer tube in a little before inserting to keep it from getting stuck.",
