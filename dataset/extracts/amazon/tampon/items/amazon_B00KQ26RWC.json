                "reviewText": "I had no idea they still made tampons like this with a cardboard applicator, since I never, ever see them in stores. Somehow I got the idea that they were inferior to plastic-applicator tampons, but I imagine that was probably marketing from tampon manufacturers because these are no less comfortable to use than plastic, and are just as absorbent as Tampax's other products, and won't be here for centuries after I die. I wish I'd known these were still available long ago -- cups don't work for me, cloth pads are a mess, and now I feel kind of bad about the hundreds of plastic applicators I've sent to the landfill when I could've been using these! But better late than never. I've also tried the Regular size with cardboard applicators and they're also just as serviceable -- however, your mileage may vary.",
