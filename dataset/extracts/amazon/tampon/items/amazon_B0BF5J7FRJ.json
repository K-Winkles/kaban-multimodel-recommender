                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. After having my baby things were just different. Tampons hurt, or were difficult to use. I couldn\u2019t quite get them in right. The most annoying thing even before having a baby was when the applicator was hard to push, or I\u2019d accidentally pinch myself. Hard to navigate \u201cin there\u201d with how far or shallow to insert\u2026 I\u2019m so glad I found these. As someone with a heavy flow, these were not nearly as messy as I thought!! Or maybe my flow is better since going non toxic?? No mess, so don\u2019t let that scare you. After reading the reviews I was comforted knowing most parts of the world use this, so as someone from the USA, having never heard of such a thing as no applicator tampons, I figured it\u2019s worth a try if others do it! I\u2019m never going back. It\u2019s so much easier to apply the tampon in the right spot. Less toxins have actually helped my period pain and flow. As you can see from the video, you can see the quality in the cotton and how it\u2019s molded. The cheaper non organic brand has \u201cfly aways\u201d and seems to open prematurely. I don\u2019t want to imagine \u201cfly aways\u201d stuck in my vagina or beyond\u2026 I 100% recommend these tampons.",
