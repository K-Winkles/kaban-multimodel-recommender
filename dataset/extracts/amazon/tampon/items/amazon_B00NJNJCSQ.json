                "reviewText": "God bless my mother who introduced me to o.b. tampons when that lovely first visit from Aunt Flo occurred...and 16 years later, I still haven't found a tampon that compares. In school, other girls would scoff at the \"grossness\" of this non-applicator tampon that you had to insert yourself...how dare you actually TOUCH your own body - much better to use a big plastic wand to do that job (so 1930's) that then needs to be somehow put back in the packaging and thrown away discreetly (because ew - who wants to see a USED applicator). Not with OB...tiny plastic wrapper that can be wadded up into your pocket until convenient to dispose without a second thought is the only baggage it brings to the table. Not to mention you can fit one in your pocket almost completely unnoticed - yay! Think of all of the garbage this world would be spared if women would move away from feeling like they NEED applicators. Honestly, once you get over the initial change of getting it in, you'll love it! I never, EVER leak from bad placement with o.b. and can't say the same from other tampons that I've used in a pinch. And it never feels like someone is taking a battering ram to your cervix - you know, when you think your have your applicator in the right spot but were very wrong as soon as you send the missile out. Really, I can't say enough good things about these tampons so get over your insecurities because who has time for that anyway.As far as \"FluidLock\" vs \"Silk Touch\"...I hadn't seen the Silk Touch ones until the last 5 years or so and used the FluidLock until that time...but now that I've tried both, I HAVE to get the Silk Touch ones because they're just so much more comfortable coming in and going out. Works just as well too, but definitely harder to find (which is why I'm buying them on Amazon). The ultra-thin wrapping around the tampon keeps it from snagging/dragging/etc going it and it's never a tug-of-war battle when it's time to switch out. Pretty much the best invention ever and I can't imagine why they don't just switch all of them over to this style. Also, the \"regulars\" are usually good enough for me, but the supers are crazy absorbent when you need that extra protection. I'm super active - run, bike, swim, chase three wild children - and I don't ever have to think about these bad boys moving out of place or bailing on me. Did I mention they are super short too? It's amazing what this little powerhouse can hold versus some of the others I've had the unfortunate experience of using that are literally 3x longer (like holy-crap-I-feel-like-a-clown-pulling-out-endless-scarves, how-long-can-this-thing-be kind of long).Do yourself a favor and try these out. You won't look back.",

Subtract one star because I have used the German version whose individual packaging is much easier to open by a simple twist.

It is almost impossible to open for the smallest size, where the twist-open mechanism is much more convenient. I wish Amazon would import the German version at some point.",

I highly recommend these tampons for anyone who has found other ones too bulky and uncomfortable.I wanted something smaller that has less plastic waste and that is easier to use. Using these is easier than it sounds. (No applicator,Just follow the directions) They are tiny and wrapped individually in thinner plastic. They expand exponentially as they fill up, and are surprisingly absorbent. They don\u2019t hurt to remove since the weight gradually increases and makes them naturally slide \u2018downhill\u2019 when very full so you know when it needs changing.I have found no leaks from this tampon so far. (They will fill up faster on a heavy day)For heavier days, probably the larger size should be selected, but I have not tried those yet.The first tampon that I have felt comfortable wearing after looking for 25 years.",
