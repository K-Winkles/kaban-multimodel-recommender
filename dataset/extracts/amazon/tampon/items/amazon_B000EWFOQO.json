What\u2019s more is they don\u2019t biodegrade, contributing to worldwide plastic-pollution.Many rayon-blend tampons have a plastic veil to prevent fibre-loss, and they can also have added perfume or dyes which is totally unnecessary for managing your period.This is why we only ever use cardboard and organic cotton.

                "reviewText": "I have used plain Tampax tampons for years because of the all-paper packaging, cardboard applicator, and 100% cotton content. A friend recently told me about how her cramps have diminished significantly from using organic cotton tampons and I became curious. I started shopping around and was surprised at how many organic tampons had plastic applicators or excessive plastic packaging. I wasn\u2019t expecting much based on the negative reviews I saw around Amazon, but I am thrilled with this product. Works just as well as my old favorite. Price is higher than my old brand, but this can be remedied by shopping in bulk. Welcome happy effects: they DO reduce cramping for me (fewer pain reducing drugs in my system),When you buy 12 packets at a time, ship in a cardboard case-size so no plastic door-to-door, fewer pesticides used due to organic farming. I researched the company and I like them, so I\u2019m happy to pay them for a product rather than the old guys. This is a win/win for me",

                "reviewText": "I don't write many reviews but thought I should. I was fighting endometriosis 19 years ago with many medical procedures and trying to make other changes as well. When I started using these tampons, I noticed a big change the first month in the amount of pain I was in. I read studies showing the bleach and other ingredients in most tampons were causing endo in animals such as monkeys being tested. I'm a big believer that those ingredients should be banned from all products but yet today they are not. This is worth spending more money for these to protect your body from chemicals going directly into your blood system! I purchase these for my daughter as well. She was born 17 years ago. I don't know if this allowed me to conceive her but I believe it certainly helped! Would never let her use any other tampon!",

First my vagina isn't the size or shape of a paper cup. I have never had a tampon open that big nor do I ever hope it does! I've never had any \"leakage\" from this tampon because of the 'line' in the tampon.The second review I came across was on the regular absorbancy of these brand. Someone said that these don't absorb as well and a super is like a regular so I bought the super. I completely disagree. The super is very much a super. I wish I had purchased the regulars. If you are normally a regular on other tampons then buy a regular, I'd say purchase one box, try out the absorbancy level, then buy the case.Overall, it's a great product, does what it's intended to do and I've had no issues with it.",

(Cotton is one of the worlds most fertilizer, pesticide and herbicide intensive crop. Scorching the soil, contaminating the water and food supply).This is a very good quality, substitute for regular cotton tampons.On the side note: The seize described as, small, medium, super are slightly smaller than the conventional cotton tampons. So, you might want to purchase a larger seize than your usual.The only thing I would (and did) complain about is the shipping package. It is weigh overpacked, (in double cardboard box) for an environmentally concious product. I hope a lot of people will complain about that so they'll reconsider the packaging.",
