The shape makes insertion (I know, ick factor) easy and as comfortable as the process could possibly be, the curve/grip means the plastic never slips or gets lost (ick again), and the tampon is easy to remove from the rapper then re-wrapped once inserted. The cotton portion itself is true to size (meaning Super actually works for a \"super\" day 1 or 2 and regular works as expected for day 3 and 4 -- for me. I've never used the other sizes.) And I've never had an issue with leakage.Packaging seems to change a lot, so definitely pay attention (sometimes the wording is fragrance-free, sometimes unscented, which is what I want... so look closely.)",

                "reviewText": "Switched to these from the kotex click. I miss the compact nature of the others but it isn't a deal breaker. These are much more absorbent than the kotex ones. I like them much better for when I have heavier flow. Leak way less than the kotex ones. Also I read something about kotex being sued for theirs shedding inside and causing issues... *TMI incoming* I do still experience sometimes where the absorbance leaves something to be desired. If you're towards the end of your period or your flow is less liquid and more like arousal texture, it seems to resist being absorbed and work it's way around the tampon instead.I recently bled an entire month (thanks birth control) and switched instead to a menstrual cup. These were just a little to absorbent for what I had going on. It also sucked to monitor how long each tampon had been in. Usually for a week it's fine, but doing it every day for a full month became exhausting. I also have a sleep disorder and sleep ~9.5 hours a night which rules out using tampons unless I wake up in the middle of the night (which again, sleep disorder, not gonna happen, lol) I also switched because I saw how much waste I'd generated over those 4 weeks.I do normally have a VERY heavy period from day 2-5 though, which is too much for the cups I have (diva and salt soft, saalt soft is way better) so I use tampons during the day on those days. They're easier to switch as needed at work. So I'd suggest considering a combination of tampons and a cup personally.Overall, good product. Better than kotex, but that's the only other tampon brand I've used.",

                "reviewText": "What can you say about tampons? OK.. these have been my favorite for as long as they have been on the market. Very absorbent. I love the plastic applicator because it is larger and finger grip is ribbed which is great for plus size women as well. Yay, we have something to hold on to. We all have to hate when inserting doesn't work out right but with these there haven't been any issues. The price was great for a 50 count box and I believe they came the very next day. Enough about tampons, makes my life easier and so I highly recommend and will continue purchasing via Amazon.",
