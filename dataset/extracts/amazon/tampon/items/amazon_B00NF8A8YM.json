                "reviewText": "This product is amazing.I must confess, this review may take an unusual turn, but stick with me. It's not every day that O.b. tampons come to the rescue outside their conventional area of application. Yet, here I am, penning a heartfelt appreciation for their service during an odd, yet desperate moment.Let me set the scene - I was attending a friend's wedding, immaculately dressed and ready for a night of merriment, when I was struck by a ruthless, unannounced nosebleed (my arch-nemesis). A crimson river was threatening to ruin my light-colored suit, and paper tissues were no match for the onslaught.Just when I was contemplating a hasty retreat, I remembered the pack of O.b. tampons I had recently purchased from Amazon (as you do, we all need a regular supply). Inspired by their promise of 'Fluid-Lock' technology, I had a lightbulb moment. If they can manage periods, surely they could handle a nosebleed, right?With an adventurous spirit, I quickly maneuvered one into each nostril. To my delight and relief, these tiny soldiers sprung into action, staunching the flood like brave knights defending their castle.The wedding proceeded, and although I had some strange looks and a few chuckles, everyone was also genuinely impressed by the tampons' performance. On the plus side, they acted as excellent conversation starters!If you're in the market for tampons that provide an excellent service in their day job AND double as heroic nosebleed stoppers, look no further than O.b. tampons.Remember, they're not just for periods anymore. They're for any 'period' when you need to halt an inconvenient flow. So, here's a well-deserved 5 stars for saving the day, and my suit!(P.S. - O.b., if you're reading this, please consider launching a line of \"Nosebleed Tampons\". You'd corner an untapped market, trust me!)",

They\u2019re convienent, discreet and make me see a noticeable difference in my period pains. Maybe it\u2019s a placebo or what, but I\u2019ve noticed a significant decrease in cramps by using these over the bleached processed tampons you can find in every grocery store. 10/10 do yourself a favor and spoil yourself with these",

I re use a plastic applicator to insert these as I dislike how they feel when you manually insert them. And wash it with every use. But you can buy a re usable applicator on Amazon for like 15 dollars. I won\u2019t use these popped open ones because god knows what\u2019s gotten in them but the originals are good. And I like how they can be used in another applicator. I\u2019d buy them again. Just watch out when removing the plastic on the outside. Make sure it\u2019s all off as once I removed it and the top plastic that goes in first was still attached because the plastic removes in two parts and I inserted that inside me lol. Thankfully it was still attached when I removed it :)",
