                "reviewText": "I dont often use tampons because I often find them uncomfortable, so I wasn't sure about trying these. Maybe it's because they are light absorbency, but I didn't have any discomfort with these at all. I like that they come compact so they are easy to discreetly carry around. I like that they absorb really well, especially for a light absorbency tampon. I didn't have any problems with the plunger, but i had checked out other reviewers for tips before trying them. I really liked that they are organic and free from a lot of the harmful chemicals that others have. As far as tampons go, I would use these again before many of the other brands that I have tried in the past.",
