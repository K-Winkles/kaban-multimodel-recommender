I have always preferred tampons with applicators, but when I needed to change tampons away from home I had a hard time hiding long packages in my shallow pockets (why must women's pockets be so shallow in the first place?). One day I saw Kotex Click and was immediately interested because the box was short, yet the product clearly stood vertically in the box! Impossible! I bought the box, read the instructions for expanding the applicator, and used them with ease.The expanded applicator is sturdy. I have been using Clicks for years, and the applicator has never collapsed while inserting. The plastic is smooth, and unscented. It's everything I want and need. I would love if Kotex made a Click for light flows (Regular is the lightest available), until then I will continue buying another brand of light tampons because I refuse to wear pantyliners.",

There's really something strange with those reviews and they almost scared me off from buying them... however I've been using Kotex since I was a teen and I trust the brand.I purchased these and they arrived before the expected arrival date and after completing a cycle I'm writing this review.These tampons are smaller than the usual Kotex tampons I used and I was skeptical at first. However after using them, they provided full protection, no leaks, super comfortable and really convenient.I had no problems with the tampon leaving an applicator whatsoever and no problems with it \"falling apart\" or the string coming loose as some of these reviewers claimed.As a matter of fact in fear of those reviews I opened the first one and tried to pull the string out. Using full force I couldn't do it and after dunking it in a glass of water to see its expansion and to test how much it holds I was more than satisfied that the negative reviews can be safely discredited.Be wary of the negative reviews!",

I get zero leakage with these, the plastic applicator is very comfortable to use, and they are small enough to fit in the tiny pocket of my skinny jeans (no more having to take my whole purse to the bathroom sheepishly at work). The extension of the applicator is easy and clicks firmly into place and doesn't slip, so these are basically like having a full size applicator but only having to carry around half of one. I can fit more of them in my purse/cosmetics bag than I could fit full sized applicators. Also, I used to have the ocassional issue with the Playtex applicator tip pinching me when the cotton pushed through. That has never happened with these. Definitely the best all around that I've tried.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using Kotex Click! for years, but the only drawback is that they are expensive at the drug store. I've been purchasing in bulk from Amazon for about 3 years, and will continue to do so until I no longer can. While $15 will buy you 1 box at Walgreens, it will get you 4 boxes on Amazon. Best deal in the world.Regarding the actual product. The small applicator makes it so you can fit it anywhere: pocket, purse, wallet, what have you. The tampon doesn't slip or leak all that much. I do recommend using a panty liner in tandem depending on your flow, but other than that it works great. If you're an active gal, this little wonder will also carry you through your strenuous workout without leaks. Overall, it's a God-sent creation worthy of praise.",

                "reviewText": "I am in my early 20's and my flow is pretty light. This tampon has a good absorbency and lasts the full eight hours. The applicator also works for me. I have been using this tampon for about a year now and the *click applicator does work, I seldom encounter an experience where it brakes apart as I am trying to insert it. If you have a light flow I recommend using the regular absorbency tampon. I have to say that what I really like as well is the packaging and no, not because of the colors (although they are a nice touch). What I like is how wrapping protects the tampon from the tumble in my purse. There have been way too many instances where my tampon comes out of its packaging (other brands) while in my purse and then its just unsanitary to use. Kotex really thought out their packaging, another plus is that its very quiet and not an annoying and loud like other plastic sound wrappings.",

                "reviewText": "I think Kotex is the best product out there. I am a very loyal user of their products and have been for over 15 years. These are great for purses, lockers, gym bags - small and discrete. Great protection too! It offers protection on par with the standard (no click) model tampon. I have no problem working out - swimming, running, etc. I don't see myself ever going back to the old school ones.Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision.",
