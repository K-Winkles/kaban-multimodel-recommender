We understand the importance of respecting women's sensitive skin, which is why our products are made with 100% organic cotton throughout - no perfume, chlorine, rayon, or other potentially harmful additives. Another advantage of pure 100% organic cotton tampons is that they are skin pH compatible, so they are an excellent solution for women with sensitive skin to help avoid allergic reaction and skin irritation. Since Organyc tampons are made entirely of soft, comfortable organic cotton, everything that touches you is, of course, also organic cotton. Expressly Designed And Created For Comfort Organyc no applicator tampons have a soft, rounded tip that is designed for gentle, easy insertion. These tampons are sleek and discreet and are designed for maximum comfort and better leak protection. According to Cotton, Inc., cotton is actually able to absorb 24 times its weight in liquid, so you can feel comforted knowing that you are using a product that truly provides complete protection.",

You can feel secure that it will protect against leaks. Rather than itchy synthetic materials, cotton created the standard for softness and set the bar for other fabrics. Synthetics can make you sweat, cotton is breathable. It is not man-made or created in a test tube and it is certainly not any kind of plastic. Cotton is nature's gift.
