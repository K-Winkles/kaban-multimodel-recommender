Both in normal day to day activities as well as more active ones like going to the gym. She still prefers her other brand overall as it's what she's always used but found these to be well worth using and comfortable. No issues with leaks at all and the value for how much you get seems to be very good.",

The following is her report:\"As a runner I always look for a comfortable barrier that protects from leakage and doesn't feel like its falling out half way through my runs. The Sport is perfect for my moving body and after 2 hours of running on a heavy flow day, I don't feel like the cork is about to pop out. The 360 protection is definitely different from a traditional horizontal protection and that design is what makes it more comfortable and stay in one place.\"In summary, she is of the opinion that these tampons really do what they claim to do and offer a level of comfort and protection during sports and physical activities that are unique and superior to what is provided by traditional barriers. She told me to give this product 5 stars, which I have done.",
