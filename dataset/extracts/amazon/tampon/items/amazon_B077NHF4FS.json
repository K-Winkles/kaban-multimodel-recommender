Maybe it\u2019s an ASMR thing but it just feels luxurious somehow.Well I finally needed tampons again after my last baby and ordered these. They look similar to the old ones but they feel cheap and like basic tampax tampons. There\u2019s nothing radiant about it. Now the wrapper is cheap crinkly plastic. I often can\u2019t get the sticker off to open it and have to rip the plastic.I was on the fence about all this plastic use because it\u2019s bad for the environment but I just couldn\u2019t give these up. But now with the downgrade maybe I\u2019ll find a more eco friendly brand.",
