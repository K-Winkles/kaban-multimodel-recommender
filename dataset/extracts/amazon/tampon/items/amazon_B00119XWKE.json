                "reviewText": "This is an amazing deal! When I originally purchased this I had no idea two boxes were coming! I thought they had made a mistake at first, but then I saw the reviews and realized two were supposed to come. Like other reviews one of the boxes was open but none of the tampons were affected in any way! Every tampon still had the individual Packaging sealed. It is so hard to find a bundle of light tampons. There is always the multi size available but very rarely do i see a box of just lights and when I do they are extremely expensive. The amount I got for the price I got was literally a steal!For those of you that say \"boohoo the box was open\" think about the price and the quantity you are receiving! It definitely outweighs the small inconvenience of a open box that you're going to open soon anyway. I would understand if the individual tampon packaging was affected. I would be upset myself, but they are not! I will most definitely be buying again!",
