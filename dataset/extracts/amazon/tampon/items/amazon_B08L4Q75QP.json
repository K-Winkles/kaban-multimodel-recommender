Well, I am so happy that I did because these are amazing! They are so much more comfortable to insert and once they are in they are always in place the right way. With my last brand (also a good name brand) sometimes they would hurt like they weren\u2019t in right. I am 40+ years old, this is not new to me. I have 3 kids. Maybe my body is not average, I don\u2019t know. But for whatever reason these are perfect every time! I\u2019ve never had an issue with them leaking or anything like that either. I hope these stay around for as long as I have my period!",
