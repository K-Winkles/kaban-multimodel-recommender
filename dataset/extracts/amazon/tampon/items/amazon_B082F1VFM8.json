                "reviewText": "On what planet do these tampons work?! I must be a Marvel superhero when I wear these horrible tampons. You should see the way I jump up from my desk at work, trip over my cords, barrel down the hallway narrowly missing colleagues, bust through the bathroom door & procceed to fight my enemy.... THE DREADED KOTEX CLICK TAMPON!!!! And this is all because they are poorly designed and leak after 30-60 minutes. I am utterly DISSATISFIED/ DISAPPOINTED in the new \"Click\" tampons. The applicator is horrible and not long enough! The absorbency rate is not the same & they have to be pushed inside the vagina with your fingers to get a somewhat decent placement. The click sound is a joke as it has to be inserted so far that no click sound is made. I thought that one of the leading suppliers of feminine health products would know that all vaginas are not the same size. Not to mention the sheer messiness of insertion if you have long fingernails! I hate to say this but your decision to \"upgrade\" our tampons was more about trying to keep up with a fad (Tampax) than the TRUE needs of your customers. We women feel abandoned by a product/ company we trusted. I will cease to use your products as I know your response/ new product will not fix the problem. Boy, I hate to jump on the tampon merry go round again after 25 years but I/WE deserve better! Capitalism wins again! What a shame......",
