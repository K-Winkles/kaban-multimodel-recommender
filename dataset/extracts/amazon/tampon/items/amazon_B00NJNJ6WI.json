I have tried every kind of tampon over the years, but I never stray far from my beloved O.B., the O.G. I appreciate being in control and reducing my exposure to plastics, but I especially love the leak protection. Although I have preferred the O.B. options of years gone by, I do really appreciate this multi-pack. I know I have exactly what I need whenever I need it. I just wish the price was a smidge lower. It's astronomical what I have spent on O.B. over the years, but I've also probably said a good amount on new underoos. Ooh- I forgot to mention how much I love the discreet form factor. And how every time I open an O.B. tampon, I smile as I am reminded of that first time I had one as a 13 year old. It always looked so sleek and \"adult.\" No other tampon compares. Thanks, O.B. You're simply THE BEST.",

That gave me plenty of time to figure out, as I did probably about 30 years ago, that these are the only ones that do not leak. Other brands, for me at least, are completely useless because you just have to wear a pad with them anyway or change them every 30 minutes. I see other people complaining they're expensive. Definitely cheaper than new underwear or if you can use 2-3 in a day rather than 10.",

I find those applicator things on tampons stupid and non functional anyways, so it's nice to not even have to bother with them. Each tampon is individually wrapped in a very small amount of plastic. I would say I wouldn't recommend these for someone who would struggle opening a small plastic package, I do find myself having a tiny bit of trouble getting them open.",

                "reviewText": "OB was my bestie till I started going \"reusable\" with menstral cups and washable pads. For a while they worked ok but after birthing three kids and trying multiple different cups, I was still leaking. I thought to myself \"why am I putting up with the stress of leaks when I KNOW these tampons will completely solve this problem?\"So I stopped using my cups and went back to my trusty OBs. I still use the washable pads as backup, but if I'm careful to use the right absorbency tampon, I don't need a backup.One less stressor in my life. Totally worth the money.",
