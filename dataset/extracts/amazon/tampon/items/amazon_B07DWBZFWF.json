So idk if there is just a shortage on these, or if they are not making them anymore. But my mom ended up finding me 8 boxes, and my bf found another 6. So happy, and will be really upset if they stop making them as I\u2019ve tried many other \u201call natural\u201d tampons that do not work well for me at all.",

TSS concerns and considering tampons are considered medical devices (because of where they go) better packaging should be a requirement.You can\u2019t even put them into your bag because the wrapping gets destroyed, and if it comes into contact with something moist, the moisture goes right through the packaging and gets the tampon dirty.Don\u2019t recommend unless they use better packaging.",

Overall I ok with them and think I\u2019ll continue using them.",
