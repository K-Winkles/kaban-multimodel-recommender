                "reviewText": "These little bags are exactly what they seem to be from the listing, except that I doubt very much they're leather, as it claims in one spot. They are some type of plastic, but the material feels pretty thick and sturdy. It does squeeze open and closed with very little effort, but stays closed naturally. It would have to be bumped and smooshed in your bag pretty specifically to risk dumping out its contents.It holds several tampons with applicators comfortably and without feeling bulky. If you have tampons without applicators, it can hold darn near the whole box.I've put four tampons and two individually wrapped personal wipes in one bag, and it closes easily and fits well. With the addition of the wipes, it starts to feel just the slightest bit bulky.There are two big drawbacks in my eyes. First, it's a bit longer than most tampons with applicators. I have a compartment in my main purse that fits loose tampons pretty perfectly, but this pouch is longer, and doesn't fit in the same spot. But at the same time that it's a little too long, it's also a little too narrow to be perfect, in my opinion. It isn't wide enough to fit a full size (thin) pad, only something more like pantiliners that are less wide. So I wish it were shaped just a bit differently to serve my purposes perfectly, but if you think from the listing it will do what you want, I expect you're right.",
