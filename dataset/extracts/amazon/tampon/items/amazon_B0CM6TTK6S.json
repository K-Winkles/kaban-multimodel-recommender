I wouldn't use these again or recommend them unless there's a tampon shortage for some reason and these are all you can find.",

                "reviewText": "These are good tampons, and I like that they are all organic cotton. They absorb the amount that I expect from my usual brands for a super tampon, though they are shorter and thicker than my usual brand.They seem intentionally designed to be short so that they can make the tampon plus applicator have a smaller footprint in your bag or pocket, which is nice. It's probably about 2/3 as long as a typical basic tampon with applicator. Because of that, when you open the package, you need to pull the back of the applicator out until it clicks so that it has the ability to push the tampon up and out of the applicator. That wasn't entirely intuitive to me with the first one.This is a fairly small package. If you use mainly super absorptance tampons during your period, you'll likely go through most of the box in one cycle. So I do wish the box were bigger to avoid repurchasing so often. And compared to my usual brand, these are quite expensive, but they are also all organic cotton, which my usuals are not. If that's a requirement for you, these seem like a fine choice.",
