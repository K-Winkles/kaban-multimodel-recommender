                "reviewText": "A long time ago I stumbled on these because of the price. They are always way cheaper then other brands but the name is as big. The black box looked cool too. I didnt know what 'click it ' was but its an awesome feature. Now, I have boxes of tampons but I'm buying these for that feature alone. So, when you use an applicator, it become half the size when the extension tube falls in where tampon use to be..'click it' is that but on outside so they start out super compact and can fit in the smallest wristlet, easily. I got a purse I love but it's small. I cant take up 1/4 space with a few tampons so i need some kotex. Plus, this brand is like playtex gentle glide....it doesn't expand to the size of an arm and width of a soda can...basically u can pee and not change it...or pee on it. Excuse me for the TMI but it's just the facts. So maybe that takes from absorbency a litle but I cant stand when they open that way. It saves me money from changing it every few hours and the discomfort when it weighing down too low like its gonna fall out. Plus that kind of hurts.",

I have used Kotex for over 20 years and they have the best tampons on the market. Boy was I wrong!! These are the worst! Now, I must know if anyone at your company even has a vagina? Were these made in a lab or a torture chamber? They are painful to insert, the applicator is too short and hard to grip. They don't absorb like the security did. How can a tampon only absorb on the sides and not the center? Women DO NOT care about fun colors! We care about being able to go to work and not needing to run to the bathroom because your tampon can't absorb your flow!! And we don't care if our tampons are compact!! No one makes our pockets big enough to carry a tampon anyway! Clearly women are not making these decisions at your company.",
