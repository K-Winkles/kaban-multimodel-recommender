I've had issues with other all natural brands coming apart during insertion or not absorbing well. But these work well and are much more comfortable than the mixed-material ones from the grocery store.My one complains it that I would like a higher ratio of the super absorbant kind. Those are much better for busy workdays.If you are in a pinch and can't wait for delivery, they sell these at Target as well.",
