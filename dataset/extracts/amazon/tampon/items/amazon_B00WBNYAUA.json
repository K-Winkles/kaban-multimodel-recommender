Plus, FormFit Protection gently expands to fit your individual shape. How long can I wear a tampon? You can wear a tampon for up to eight hours, but never leave a tampon in longer than that.

Choosing the right tampon absorbency can make a big difference to be comfortable and avoid leaks. Take the Tampax Quiz on Tampax's website to learn more. How does Tampax Pocket Pearl differ from Tampax Pearl? Both Tampax Pearl and Tampax Pocket Pearl offer outstanding protection with a LeakGuard Braid to help prevent leaks. The main difference is that Tampax Pocket Pearl is compact in size so it fits in your pocket. When ready to use, extend the compact applicator to make it full-size.",

                "reviewText": "As a 30 something year old woman, I've tried numerous tampons/pads always trying to find the best quality with the best coverage. I've always been a fan of Tampax and I must say that when I first got the box, I was surprised at just how tiny the tampons appeared. They come in cute wrappers that are easy to open. They tear along the side, at the bottom for easy removal. You pull the applicator down and it snaps into place, bringing it to the same size as a regular tampon. There was no problem with the applicator being weaker or sliding back into it's original compact state. Using this was a breeze, I had no problems. As far as the coverage goes - I didn't notice a huge difference between this compact tampon and the full size ones - no leakage! I personally like the coverage/protection Tampax tampons have always given and this is no exception.Overall, they're cute and they fit well in your pocket, pocketbook, bookbag or any where else you carry things you need on hand. They're easy to assemble (snapping the applicator into place) and are just as easy to use. The coverage was great and I had no issues. I will definitely be purchasing them in the future! This gets two thumbs up!I received a free sample of Tampax to try from SheSpeaks and the following are my own opinions.",

                "reviewText": "The new Tampax Pocket Pearls are compact and discreet enough to keep in your pocket or purse. They have an extendable applicator (you simply pull until it clicks when ready to use) that comes with an extra layer of protection to help stop leaks. Leaking is something I definitely don't want to deal with so the built-in backup layer of protection is crucial for me.Each pocket pearl comes with an easy-open tab...no more struggling to open the package. They also have a anti-slip grip that it makes it easier to hold onto. It's no fun when you are on your period-even worse when you have to struggle with opening the package and holding onto the tampon.I've always used the Tampax brand and would definitely keep the Pocket Pearls handy. Tampax Pocket Pearls are very discreet and are truly convenient...perfect for on the go. It's important to me that I can stay active when on my period and these pocket pearls allow me to do just that and not have to worry about protection-especially leakage. They are available in regular, super, super plus, and come in a duo-pack as well.I received a free sample of Tampax to try from SheSpeaks and this is my honest opinion and review about the product.",

                "reviewText": "I always find myself looking for these tampons for my monthly needs.After reading a couple reviews, I do agree that occasionally you'll come across a tampon or two where the applicator will snap out of place while inserting so you will have to pull it out back into place and finish inserting. But for myself, I don't find that to be too much of a hassle because it doesn't render the entire tampon useless, I just have to readjust.Everything else though, I do appreciate. I appreciate that even the regular size will hold for about 3-4 hours on my heavy days and doesn't leak as quickly as some others. I also love the fact that it is smaller and that makes a big difference for me because on heavy days I really don't like how bulky and how much space some other tampons take in my bag or pocket.I think if you're on the fence about these tampons, I'd give it a shot and if there are too many faulty applicators in the box I'd notify the company or go with the regular Tampax Pearl tampons, they work well too.",

You just have to make sure its in properly or you'll have leaking or that uncomfortable feeling of it not sitting right.For the \"regular\" flow, it does its job. No issues expect on heavy days.Packaging is fine, everything came intact and looks good. I usually just bring these for work so I don't have to have such bulky tampons in my pocket.",

                "reviewText": "I was a little worried to try this product because of all the reviews, but I did anyways. The main complaint I saw was the clicking and I thought it was very decent pulling it slowly helped. I think tampax is a great company to use anyways and they made it better by getting these. They are very discreat and small they can fit into your pocket or handbag without showing the world. I have had the regular size ones in my purse and opening my purse you could see them and its embarrassing we as ladies like the private items to stay private and this does that!I received a pack of 36 regular ones (of your heavier of course buy a different asborancy then mine). And I will be sharing a picture of what it will look like when it comes in the mail.I like the back up braid for extra protection the last thing we want is to have anything extra show. Along with the smooth applicator that is a nice touch.And don't get me started on the colors they are bright and pretty and still discrete no one would be able to tell what it was if they did happen to see them!I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the easy open tab was not that easy for me. Lol but that could just me not being strong enough.Overall I like this product and think Tampax had a great idea and I can't wait to see what they come out with next! I will for sure look into buying more when this box is completely gone.I received a free sample of Tampax to try from SheSpeaks and the above is my own opinion.",
