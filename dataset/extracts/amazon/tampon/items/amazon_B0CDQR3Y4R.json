                "reviewText": "As all the other reviewers have said, this product works fine for the ladies and their tampons or sanitary napkins. However I am a guy, and I use this product, too. There is another use that has not been mentioned. Anyone who likes to be clean - or has to be clean to avoid irritating hemorrhoids - after doing number two will use a Wet One or a baby wipe after using the toilet paper. These wipes do not dissolve like toilet paper. They can and do accumulate and clog the plumbing. This has been a problem at work to the point that the building manager has posted signs in the Men's Rooms not to flush wet wipes or paper towels down the toilet. So at work I keep a box of scensible refills. Before going to the Men's Room I pull out a pink bag, put a couple of clean wet wipes inside. When finished with my business I put the pink bag (with the used wet wipes inside) into the trash can. At home I have a dispenser in the guest bathrooms and the master bathroom. I personally use the pink bags at home in the same way as at work so my toilets don't clog. Okay, I have bared my soul and that was all somewhat gross, so I apologize. But this is another perfectly legitimate - if off-label - use for these pink bags. They're great.",

I didn't want to instruct guests to not dispose of feminine products elsewhere without providing them with an option for disposal. Plus, placing items directly in the garbage can (albeit closeable), is not pleasant for the guest or for me cleaning up. This gem is nicely size, installs in minutes and is a simple reminder to put non flushable items in this cute little bag before placing it in the trash. Highly recommend and glad we purchased this item.",

I know what can and can not go in the tank, but I can't always count on friends of mine or my kids to know or listen to the lecture I give of about the do's and don'ts of RV tanks. I placed it on the wall right next to the toilet paper and it seems to be doing the trick...no tank issues! Great product!",
