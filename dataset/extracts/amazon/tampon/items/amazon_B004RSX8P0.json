I think on the heaviest of days, I can get a solid 2-1/2 to 3 hours. Please note it has to be the CARDBOARD Tampax in the Super Plus, NOT the plastic Super Plus...that ish don't work!I rated a four star simply because it is not the Kotex brand which would last a solid 4 to 4-1/2 hours....yep, that long.",
