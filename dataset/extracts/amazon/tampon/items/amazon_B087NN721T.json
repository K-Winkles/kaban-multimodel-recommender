                "reviewText": "Ok, so have to say, I'm tired of reading these 1 star reviews talking about how these aren't Security tampons. Obviously...because they are NOT Security tampons. If you want Security tampons, then buy Security tampons. However, personally, I would rank the U by Kotex Click Compact far superior. I've used a Security tampon and thought I had purchased Super absorbency my mistake...those things are gigantic, and who wants a loud, attention grabbing wrapper...ick.These Compact Click tampon are small, discrete, and they WORK GREAT!! I don't need use anything larger than a regular absorbency, because thankfully, even after 3 kids I have a normal flow. Anything more is just unneeded for me, but that doesn't mean I haven't tested them in comparison to other brands. I have tried many brands over the years, being in my 30s now, and these are the only kind that actually do what they are supposed to. Gushes are protected, and rarely get past these things...the only time is when I haven't been able to swap them out as quickly as needed...my fault, not the tampon. I think it's great that I can quickly pop one into my pocket, unnoticed, if I don't want to haul my entire purse/handbag to the restroom. Plus, you don't have that loud, crinkly tampon wrapper of days gone by. They work, they're small...they're not your Grandma's (or Mom's) tampon...win win!Try them. If you don't like them, then go back to your staple brand. But stop knocking something that just doesn't work for you or giving a bad review for not being another brand. For most of us, these are the best tampons out there!",

                "reviewText": "I have used & strongly preferred OB tampons since my first period (decades ago) but was forced to branch out awhile back due to sudden changes in packaging, price & availability. While I am conflicted about using a brand with excess applicator waste, I have found U by Kotex to be superior in both comfort & leak protection due to what seems like a better texture (cross between OB fluid lock & silk?) & fit (slightly longer & thinner by just a few millimeters). Especially for the Super Plus size! My only (trivial to me) complaints have been that the Regular size tampons tend to require manual insertion because they stick in the applicator & the outer plastic packaging for all of them sticks to my hands when trying to throw away sometimes (some sort of static electricity).",

                "reviewText": "I was searching for a product for plugging a small leak in the radiator of our VW beetle. Remembering a product called Stop Leak (very creative branding, yes?) Amazon instead provided me with an extensive selection of feminine products.Considering that my household tends to go through these things like it was their job, I figured I may as well splurge on two of these massive boxes.The good news is that they do stop leaks as advertised. Unfortunately this does not solve my radiator issue.So, as far as quality, they explained that they were \u201cSuper\u201d, which ironically is also printed on the box.I can\u2019t say that I have a lot of personal experience with these products. The price was fair and I got no complaints. Praise Jesus!!Hope this reviews helps you. I\u2019ll try to let y\u2019all know if I ever get the dang radiator to stop leaking.",
