                "reviewText": "As a husband and father frequently tasked with purchasing pads for my wife and daughter, I've navigated the vast sea of menstrual care products, often veering towards cost-effective solutions over big-name brands.My logic was simple: why pay more for a product when its alternatives seem to offer the same basic functionality? This perspective, admittedly from a man's viewpoint, recently led me to test the waters with Amazon Basics Maxi Pads. Here's my honest assessment of their performance compared to more renowned brands.Quality and Effectiveness: Contrary to my initial skepticism, Amazon Basics Maxi Pads have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness. The concern with absorption and leakage is paramount when it comes to menstrual products\u2014a reality I've become increasingly aware of through the experiences shared by my wife and daughter. To my relief, Amazon Basics has not only met but exceeded expectations in this regard, standing toe-to-toe with the big names in terms of reliability and comfort.Cost vs. Performance: The decision to try Amazon Basics was primarily driven by the potential cost savings. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the lower price point did not equate to a compromise in quality. The pads provide the necessary protection and assurance, making them a viable option for those looking to manage menstrual care expenses without sacrificing performance.",

Of course I had no idea these Amazon pads were identical as the Walmart. Next time I'll check on Walmart and compare the price. Since they are the same product. I won't recommend these if you are a heavy bleeder.",
