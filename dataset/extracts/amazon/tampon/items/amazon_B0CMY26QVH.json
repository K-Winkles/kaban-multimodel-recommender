After trying a handful of different organic tampons I was so relieved that August worked for me. My only complaint, and the reason I docked a star, was getting the 12 boxes each containing 8 tampons. I knew this was a thing before purchase thanks to other comments, but I still find this silly and wasteful. I hope in the future there might be a better way of packaging these.",

                "reviewText": "These are quality tampons. They are made with organic cotton, which is very nice for peace of mind. They work just like the name brand I'm used to. I experienced zero leakage or issues. They are a bit more costly than what you might purchase at the drugstore, but that is the trade-off for the organic cotton. The only (small) thing I wish these had that my current brand does have is the little knot at the end of the string, which aids in removal. That's a feature I prefer, and it would be nice if August could add the knot to these tampons - but that's a personal preference. I do really like this combo pack of Regular and Super. It covers what I need to get through all the stages of my cycle.",

I have a condition where I have needed tampons every day since the age of 13. I go through a box at least every week so I would say I am extremely knowledgeable in this department. I have tried many many kinds, but this one was far away from being OK. The way it expanded made it very painful to take out so needless to say this was not something I could continue to use.",
