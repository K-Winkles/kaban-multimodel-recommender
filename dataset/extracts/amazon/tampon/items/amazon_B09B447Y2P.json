Because the tampon and liner are conveniently packaged together, you'll never leave home without an emergency backup again. I haven't ruined a pair of underwear since I started using Duets.The packaging is absolutely beautiful- I keep the box on display in my bathroom. I love that this company is entirely run by women who are working towards ending the stigma around periods, while promoting education of women's bodies, cycles, and all things menstruation. I simply cannot say enough good things about this product and company. Make the switch to MOONS Duets, and you'll never use another period product again.",

                "reviewText": "This \"system\" is simple in its idea - a tampon + a liner in one pack. This is small, discreet, and easy to carry. Perfect for travel, work, the gym, festivals, and more. I like the convenience of being able to toss this in a bag and go. I don't have to hunt down multiple products to stock my bag.Absorbency is good - no leaks with the tampon. The liner is thin, but it protects underwear from stains.Overall these work well and are nontoxic. Great product!",

                "reviewText": "I love that this set has both a pad and a tampon in each packet! Both the tampon and pad are individually wrapped so, that can be used at separate times if needed. The tampon is easy to insert and comfortable once in place. The tampon is absorbent enough to last about 6 hours on my heaviest flow days. The pad is very thin but it adheres well to my underwear and protects them from spotting.",

                "reviewText": "I used this thinking what makes this different/cool / revolutionary and worthy of the \"moon\" marketing. These are good tampons but nothing really special, in my opinion. they are a mix of polyester and cotton so not special in that regards, they are mostly synthetic. THe applicator is a lot of plastic, I mostly prefer low waste period products, they could really work on that. THat being said, the applicator does work very well. It is convenient having the thing liner and the tampon together, especially for travel. This is a good set but doesn't fo above and beyond the moon.",
