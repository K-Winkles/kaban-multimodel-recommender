                "reviewText": "I am late to the world of tampons. I'd been using pads for the majority of my life and decided to make the switch because frankly, I was tired of feeling gross. The worst part of my period wasn't necessarily the cramps and bloating although that isn't fun, but I find that manageable what with pain meds and the bloating eventually goes away. I just hated the feel of a soiled sanitary pad and feeling it be moistened throughout the day, especially after waking up in the morning or getting up after sitting for a while - you get that huge rush. UGH! Hate to be graphic but... yeah!Anyway, I've been trying to find my holy grail of tampons ever since. I started off with playtex but found those just to be alright so I made the switch to tampax and have like them better, however lately I have been having trouble with the push up of the tampax pearl. For some reason (maybe a bad box) but it has become very difficult to get them to deploy with the push up. I'd been hearing so much how wonderful Tampax radiant tampons are and they have lived up to their reputation. I've purchased the regulars offline but was having so much trouble finding the super plus tampons anywhere. As with all things when I can't find it offline I come to amazon and voila! What was even better is that there was a coupon so these turned out to be super cheap add on item.",

I used to think that the applicators were the only thing that set tampons apart and that the insides were basically the same. But now I've leaked horribly after an hour using these super plus tampons twice now and each time the tampon has still had a large unused white streak left behind. What's a half a super plus tampon worth? Not much! And unfortunately I had stocked up on a sale. I'm sooooooooo disappointed and fearful to leave the house... Grrr. Incidentally, I've never had any issue with any other Tampax or generic version copying Tampax in 25 years. I recognize that we're all put together uniquely; so if you're going to try them, I definitely recommend trying a small box first!",
