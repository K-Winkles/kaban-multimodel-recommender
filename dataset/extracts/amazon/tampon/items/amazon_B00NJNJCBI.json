I also appreciate that OB tampons are super easy to carry around (they are the size of chapstick!) and have minimal waste.",

This size is for medium to heavy days, depending on your body. I also buy the purple ones. They expand in a rounded shape, not a weird square. They are easy & fit in your pocket, or anywhere you want to carry them. I leave some at every house I visit bc it\u2019s easy to put a few in the cabinet bc they take up practically no space & the wrapping is better than other brands. If you haven\u2019t tried them, just see if you like them. And Amazon has the best price over any drugstore. I will continue to buy them.",
