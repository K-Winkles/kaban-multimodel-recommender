TSS is a rare but serious disease that may cause death. Please consult the product insert for further information. WARNING SIGNS OF TSS ARE, FOR EXAMPLE, SUDDEN FEVER (USUALLY 102\u00b0 F OR MORE), VOMITING, DIARRHEA, FAINTING OR NEAR FAINTING WHEN STANDING UP, DIZZINESS, OR A RASH THAT LOOKS LIKE A SUNBURN. IF THESE SIGNS OR OTHER SIGNS OF TSS APPEAR, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE TAMPON AT ONCE, DISCONTINUE USE, AND SEE YOUR DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY. IMPORTANT FACTS ABOUT TSS:There is risk of TSS to all women using tampons during their menstrual period. TSS is a rare but serious disease that may cause death. There are scientific studies that have concluded that tampons contribute to the cause of TSS. The reported risks are higher to women under 30 years of age and teenage girls. The incidence of TSS is estimated to be between 1 and 17 cases of TSS per 100,000 menstruating women and girls per year. REDUCING YOUR RISK OF TSS:You can reduce the risk of developing TSS during your period by alternating tampons with feminine pads. You can avoid any possible risk of getting tampon-associated TSS by not using tampons. There are scientific studies which have concluded that higher absorbency tampons increase the risk of TSS. You should select the minimum absorbency needed to control your flow to reduce the risk of developing TSS. Tampons are available in a range of absorbencies: Regular Absorbency (6-9 grams), Super Absorbency (9-12 grams) and Super Plus Absorbency (12-15 grams). Each absorbency range represents the grams of fluid that can be absorbed by all manufacturers' tampons based on a standardized laboratory test. Use this information to compare the absorbency of these tampons to other brands. If you have had warning signs of TSS in the past, you should check with your doctor before using tampons again. Consult your doctor if you have any questions about tampon use and TSS. See more",

                "reviewText": "I have menorrhagia and need Ultra tampons but I couldn't find a review anywhere comparing the specifics of the two Ultra tampons (w/applicators, I don't mess with O.B.) so I decided I would write one.I've been using Tampax Pearl Ultra and bought a box of these for comparison- so here's what I think:The applicator with these comes apart really easily- the plunger just falls out unless you keep your finger on the bottom of it, which is sort of hard for me to do because the applicator is long and I have small hands. --Now that I've been using these for a while, it's gotten easier but the plunger still sucks-- Conversely, the Tampax applicator plunger cannot fall out from the rest of the applicator.The Gentle Glide grip area is similar to the grip on the Tampax Radiant and is better than the grip area on the Tampax Pearl.I do like Playtex's slimmer applicator compared to thick one used by Tampax.The Playtex wrapper is apparently not made to be used to dispose of the application like Tampax wrappers are and is made of thinner material that (from past experience) tends to tear open when they are put in purses/backpacks.I really like that the Playtex tampon expands in all directions (hence the 360 name I guess).Tampax Pearl only expands on two sides.I haven't had any leaks with these after using them for nearly a full month. I have had leaks with Pearl Ultra, but I've using them for quite a while so that really isn't a fair comparison. With the Pearl I almost always wore a pad because of the leaks, I've been able to stop doing that.I think the lack of leaks is because the 360 design handles clots (a significant problem for me) much better.If they would just change the plunger on these so it doesn't fall out of the applicator, I would give these 5 stars.What I want is the Playtex Gentle Glide 360 tampon in the Tampax Radiant (not Pearl) applicator and wrapper but that's not going to happen.I've decided to change brands to the Playtex Gentle Glide 360 because a having superior tampon far outweighs having a somewhat flawed applicator and cheap wrappers.I really wish there were more Ultra tampon options available.I'm grateful Amazon offers this as a subscribe and save item, because it is much cheaper than buying it anywhere else, but I really wish they would let you sign up for more than one box a month.",
