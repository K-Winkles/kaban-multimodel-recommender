The spotting was too heavy for a liner but too light for a regular tampon (plus I didn\u2019t want to wear pads all of the time), so this was a godsend. I switched back to the pill so I\u2019m not spotting 24/7 anymore, but these are still good for lighter period days or when I occasionally have heavier spotting. For everyone writing negative reviews for the size L about being too small\u2014pick a larger size. It\u2019s supposed to be smaller than regular tampons, and I\u2019m glad for that!",

As a minimalist and eco-conscious individual, these are a must-have. Also an added bonus that they are organic too! They are so great to travel with because of how small they are. I already love them!",

I love these small minimalist wrappings; these tampons fit easily in your pocket, sock, bag, etc...without all of the noisy bulky brightly-colored packaging. It's unscented and they have the light variety which is nice - if a tampon is too absorbent it can kill you (toxic shock).",
