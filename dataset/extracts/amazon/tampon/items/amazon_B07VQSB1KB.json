However there are several things I did not like about these. First, I am surprised an organic tampon would come with a plastic applicator. Second, the way the applicator goes in it actually pinches my labia every time I push the tampon section closed! Third, because they are \u201ccompact\u201d, they do not go in as far and the blood just flows around them and out into your panties. I won\u2019t be purchasing this brand if I have other choices.",
