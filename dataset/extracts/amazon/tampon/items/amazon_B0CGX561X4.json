I am not sure what kind of wood it is but it is fairly light for its size. The staining and painting all looks nice and I didn't notice any blemishes.If I had one critique it would be that the box needs to be about 1/8-1/4\" taller. Tampons fit vertically in it but there is just enough of their wrapper sticking up to make the lid not sit flush.",
