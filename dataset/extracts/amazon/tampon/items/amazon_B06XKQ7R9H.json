I had never thought twice about using common brands of feminine products, until one day on Facebook I saw an ad (for a similar product) where they asked women what their hygiene products were made of, then read them the list. I was so surprised. Then I wondered if the tampons I was using could be the cause of my irritation while using them (I had just thought it was hormone-related). Immediately after I started using these, my irritation went away. It was literally instant difference. I\u2019ve been using them several months now, and I can honestly say they\u2019ve fixed my problem. Also, in case you\u2019re wondering, they insert and \u201cwear\u201d just like any big brand of tampon. They don\u2019t have any weird \u201cshedding\u201d like I\u2019ve seen people mention in reviews of other organic tampons.",

And I swear to God, my periods are shorter since using them. I think it\u2019s true that the national brands put chemicals in theirs that make you bleed more. Oh....AND they have black wrappers! THANK YOU!!! I\u2019ve NEVER understood why they all think we want neon or bright white wrapped tampons in our purses.",

I read the reviews for a few other organic tampons and found these had the highest ratings. And now that I've used them I agree! They work like any other name brand tampon I've used. The cotton doesn't fray as apparently others do, I guess. And they do their job perfectly! Im so glad I found them! Here's to another step to minimizing harmful chemicals and toxins so I can have a healthier body!",
