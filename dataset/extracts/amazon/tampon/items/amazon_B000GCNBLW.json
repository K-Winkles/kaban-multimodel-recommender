The only ones available in the stores now a days have plastic applicators and those are such a toxic waste, filling up the landfills with yet more plastic/petroleum waste! This product with the cardboard applicator will degrade eventually in the landfills and so this necessary product is environmentally friendly. The product itself is fine and easy to use and comfortable still.",

I have always stayed true to my cardboard ones! Think the price was a little high but when you are desperate you will pay anything and think that is what the seller was counting on.",
