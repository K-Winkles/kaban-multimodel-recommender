I didn't. Not until a friend of a friend told me her vaginal horror story. I won't go into it - but I was scared for life. Every time I slide the inferior bleach and plastic harbored substandard tampon in I would think of her and fear for my lady bits. So I ordered these and my vaginal prayers were answered as if by some magical organic cotton tampon unicorn. Or maybe little baby tampon Jesus. Or the tampon Rajneesh. Or Marduk, the great unifying tampon god...But I digress. These were ok.",
