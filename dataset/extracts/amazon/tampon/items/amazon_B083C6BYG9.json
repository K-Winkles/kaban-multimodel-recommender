                "reviewText": "So, I typically do not use tampons because the concept of inserting them always made me feel uncomfortable, even when I inserted them correctly. I've also heard media horror stories of health defects for those who have forgotten they were wearing them and left them in for too long.However, I did not anticipate that my period would occur within the timeframe that I had already purchased tickets and planned to go to a water park with my family. I'd imagine a pad would not be very sufficient, but as I've had a very positive experience with the Rael [large] pads, I decided to try out their tampons.They worked amazingly! It fit perfectly and I hardly noticed that I had it inserted except for times that I exerted too much movement when I had not eaten. I wore it for about 4 hours and I even wore period swimwear bottoms just in case they leaked, which they didn't. The Super tampon managed to hold it all in (I was experiencing medium bleeding), and I was able to enjoy the 100\u00b0F day at the water park without having to worry about my period. THANK YOU \u2665 I will still have a preference for their pads, but I will definitely still utilize their tampons as needed.",

                "reviewText": "The quest for a perfect organic product is a chore. The quest for a perfect organic tampon is equivalent to the search for the Holy Grail. These tampons were my Holy Grail of Organic Tampons. Were. As in, used to be, previously, former.After coming across these magical little plugs, I would order them in bulk, so I had a nice little stash squirrelled away in my bathroom cabinet. Not toilet paper in March of 2020 aggressive, but enough to last me through a few supply chain shortages. They were perfect. Easy to insert, comfortable, stayed put, and didn't leak (much...some times it wouldn't matter if you had a whole cotton field up there, but, ces't la vie). Last week, I noticed I was down to a box, so I placed another order. When Aunt Rosa knocked on my door, I wanted to be ready for her arrival.Her scheduled stay lapsed a bit longer than usual this week (I'm assuming her flight was cancelled over the July 4 weekend), and I had to crack into an extra box to accommodate her. As I pulled the tab across the top of the package, I noticed that the wrapper had changed, and I was happy that they'd switched from plastic to paper. Cool, I thought, I feel even better about using these than I did.That feeling was incredibly short lived as my fingers grasped the paper, gave it a satisfying rip, only to discover that my beloved applicator had also changed. It went from King Arthur strong to court jester flimsy. WTF, I thought to myself, why would they do that? Well, at least the tampon is the same, I suppose I'll make do. I consoled myself with that thought as I went to insert it.But I could feel it right away. This WASN'T the same. My insides were screaming out, FOREIGN INVADER! WHO LET THIS PIECE OF TRASH IN HERE??? With shame, I pulled the tampon out, and trudged over to my purse to try and find an errant remnant of what had now become my past period life to appease my angry lady bits.At this point, I can't order these anymore, and will no longer recommend them to anyone. The new design is like a Tyra makeover: No one asked for it, no one wanted it, and certainly everyone thinks they're worse for having done it.If you bring back the old ones, please let me know. I'll be on my horse, wandering through the desert, trying to find my new Holy Grail tampon, hoping it doesn't turn into another mirage.",

As someone else mentioned, they do look smaller but honestly they are so incredibly absorbant, size doesn't matter as they cam handle a heavier flow.
