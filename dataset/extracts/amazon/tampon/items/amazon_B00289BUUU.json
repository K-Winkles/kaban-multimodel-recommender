The sport doesn't open correctly and simply the organic breaks apart to easily like Tampax the material used in both those hurt very bad and deteriorates off n you find pieces of it when you take it out n wipe later... This is only one that you can put in glass of water as demonstration it opens like a flower the material used is very soft n comfortable with no leaks... I unfortunately have the sport Playtex right now it doesn't open properly n leaks...I was 25 before I could use I tried many times before they hurt or dry.. It sucked my friend showed me these and anything I've had to use after are painful so no wonder most refuse tampons... So if you're like me try these if you want comfort",
