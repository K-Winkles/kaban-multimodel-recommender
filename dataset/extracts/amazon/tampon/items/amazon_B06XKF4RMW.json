Tell me why I received them and they came in plastic packaging and were noticeably bigger. The regular is almost as big as the Super used to be and the Super is wayy bigger. The light ones are close to how they used to be but are def bigger. I don't know if this is like a dupe version and I got scammed or something. They could have changed the way they make them but idk.. They are not impossibly big or anything, I am still going to use them but the size difference is kinda noticeable (coming from someone who doesn't tend to notice these kinds of things).",

                "reviewText": "I also moved over to non-chlorinated panty liners that have been wonderful and a menstrual cup, but I am still hugely relieved at how great these are. I'm very chemical-sensitive and have had years of itching, dryness, and infections particularly around my period. I finally caved and bought these to try out and I'm actually a little angry that this was such a simple fix. I have a very heavy flow and I usually use both pads and tampons. These worked perfectly and were much less irritating than normal tampons. For the first time in years I had a period (several now) without any itching, no irritation, no infections, and minimal discomfort. these tampons are as or possibly more absorbant than the ones you buy at the store and the price isn't as prohibitive as it could be. I'm never going back to chlorinated or chemically treated menstrual products and neither should you.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve trying to switch out toxic items in my home for those that are clean/cleaner. I never realized how many ingredients are in tampons! I did extensive research and couldn\u2019t find a clean tampon that everyone seemed to love. I decided to try these and I\u2019m pleased with them. I had no issues with insertion, leaking or the tampons being uncomfortable. All the reviews I read previously had either raved, or complained about those issues. I will say, these work just as well as my toxic alternative and I\u2019d repurchase. Clean products cost more, so if it\u2019s important to you to limit your body\u2019s exposure to chemicals, pay the extra cost.",

                "reviewText": "Honestly, I feel as if these tampons changed my life! I bought these tampons because they were organic cotton and I read that they can help menstrual cramps (not scientifically proven... however... once I started using these, I barely had any cramps!) With \"normal\" tampons, I was going through SO many and felt miserable! My flow was like a crime scene that lasted a minimum of 5 days! Once I began using these, my cramps were manageable (I felt it so I knew SHE was coming but I could still function with my everyday life). I only went through about 10 tampons per period and the remainder of the time I would just use a panty liner. I have been using these tampons for about 5 months and I highly recommend! Just a side note, the tampons aren't that absorbent so I change them frequently; however, they are worth it!",

I wanted to wait to review until I\u2019d used them for two periods, and let me tell you my friends these are SO awesome.I have had no problems with them pulling apart as other reviewers have mentioned. Even when totally full, inserting and removing them is done just like with any other tampon.These cotton ones might even be MORE absorbent than other popular brands as they seem to last me longer. They are small and compact, easily fit into a pocket.My favorite part is that I know what I\u2019m putting into my body with these.",
