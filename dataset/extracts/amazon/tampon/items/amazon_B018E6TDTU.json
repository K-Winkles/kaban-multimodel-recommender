                "reviewText": "These would be a great gift for your worst enemy. Basically joke tampons. Nothing about them works. I can't believe all the good reviews are legit. First off, the individual tampon wrappers are IMPOSSIBLE to open, i can barely tear it or pull it open, you really need scissors to open each tampon, it's ridiculous (and super fun around 3am when you're half asleep and trying to change your tampon) and next, once you're properly frustrated from opening the stupid thing, here comes the applicator....um... whyyy is there even an applicator?? It's pushes the tampon up 1/2 an inch and the tampon stays STUCK in the applicator!! Then you have to grab the end of the tampon (not ideal if you didn't wash your hands right before) and then tug and yank the tampon OUT of the worthless plastic applicator, just to have to manually insert it (and it's a weirdly long skinny shape that never feels comfortable once its in).Like, are these joke tampons? Are they counterfeit made by some fake company trying to rip off a real brand? I don't understand how these even made it past the test phase! I even read the box, I thought I had to be missing something--why is there even an applicator if it doesn't actually insert the tampon??! Will obviously never repurchase. Literally did NO ONE, test these out? Am I missing something?? These are ridic and should be illegal for the level of aggravation they cause.",
