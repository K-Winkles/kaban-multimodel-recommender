                "reviewText": "I really, really wanted to love these. Great concept, I can get behind organic and sustainable. However, the product needs to function and that's where these fell short. The applicator wasn't an issue for me, but they should provide more obvious instructions that you have to twist the applicator before pushing (I'd guess most of the negative reviews about the applicator didn't realize thus). My biggest complaint is that they are designed to absorb lengthwise only, not widthwise. Thus, you're either dealing with constant leaks or your blowing through super tampons at an alarming clip. I can't justify the price for the number I was going through and the hassle of still experiencing leaks. If they changed the design of how they absorb, I'd try them again. For now, I'm out.",
