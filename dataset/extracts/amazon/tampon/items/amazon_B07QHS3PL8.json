                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars CONVERT- Never using tampons again",
                "reviewText": "FYI- this will be a descriptive review and may be TMI for some people...I have been curious about the period cups, but have been too nervous to try them. I've also read that the dyes that make them blue, purple, or pink are artificial and unsafe. The color used in these is from charcoal, so it's safe, and the reusable ones are colorless, if you want to go that route. In addition, I don't want to have to clean period blood out of a cup in a public restroom and boil it at home (yuck).Flex disposable disks are a different story. Take all of the upsides of tampons (versus pads or the ick factors of reusable menstrual cups) and multiply that by 100. To be honest, I have not tried reusable cups or discs, nor do I plan on it. Evidently, one must be aware of how high or low their cervix is, and other factors that I, personally, don't know how to determine. They are pricey and you don't know how they'll fit you, especially the cups, from what I've heard in reviews, such as Period Nirvana reviews on youtube. The suction aspect of cups seems complicated and the upkeep is more than I want to deal with.Enter flex disposable discs! Imagine that you could safely use a tampon for 12 hours at a time, whilst being able to use the bathroom without having to change your tampon. For those who hate the feel of pads or hate using overnight pads and STILL having leaks on undies, clothes, or sheets, I wholeheartedly suggest discs. I hate using pads overnight and have tried using incontinence underwear overnight because I somehow always leaked using extra long overnight pads. So I preferred using tampons, but due to the risk of TSS, I used to set an alarm for 4 am to change my tampon. This cycle, I started using the flex disposable discs and periods couldn't be easier. I HAVE NOT HAD ANY LEAKS and I'm a complete beginner in this kind of thing. As I mentioned, they self empty when you pee, or go #2. From reviews, I heard that if you didn't check your disc after using that bathroom, or even if you sneezed, leaks could happen and could be scary and intense. Since this is my first time using these, I've worn period underwear or pantyliners to be safe, but have not had any messy or gross problems. To be safe, I wash my hands after using the bathroom and use a clean finger (or thumb) to push the rim up behind my public bone to make sure it's in place and I won't leak. Period Nirvana suggests removing your disc in the shower if you're new to this alternative and to mentally prepare for the sight of blood, but I haven't had any problems; in fact, my period seems to be lighter than ever (I don't know if that's related to the disc or not). In terms of cramps, I read some amazing stories about debilitating cramps getting better with discs, and I'm happy to report that in my case, I only had one day of the most minimal cramps ever. Growing up, my school knew that I'd need to be absent at least one day every month because I'd be doubled over in pain. In summation, if you can use tampons (especially tampons with no applicator or the painful cardboard applicators) you can use disposable discs- I really believe you can do it! I've had times with Tampax pearl where the string comes off or the string is in backwards and I've completely panicked, but with a disc, you don't even need to put your entire finger in the find the rim. As for inserting, there's no complicated way of folding (like you do with a menstrual cup). I believe the flex reusable has a notch that needs to go in the front or the back in order to be leak proof, but with the disposable, simply pinch it in half (to make it like a tampon) and slide it in! It may even be smaller than some tampon applicators, but it's more comfortable that the best gliding tampons I've ever used. My favorite part is that before bed, I can put in a disc and not have to worry about Toxic Shock Syndrome. In a 24 hour day where I'd normally use AT LEAST 6 tampons (I use a new one every time I pee or take a shower, and use 2 during the night), I use 3 discs- in my early 30s, my flow can be heavy on day 2 or 3, I've been changing my disc during the day since I'm new to this, but I could probably just use 1 every 12 hours.I literally never thought I'd say this, but I'm never going back to tampons.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Disc vs cup: TMI things to know from a long time user!",
                "reviewText": "First off, I\u2019ve been using both cups and menstrual discs for years. They. Are. The. Best. I bought light \u201cperiod underwear\u201d for small leaks which I only have to use on my heaviest days. More on that later. Both cups and discs are cramp-free. Read that again. No more cramps. I don\u2019t know the magic but if cramps ruin your life this information might just save it. Totally worth the learning curve! You also shouldn\u2019t feel them while you are wearing them. If you do, you should try a different one, since not all discs/cups are created equal! I started my journey with another brand of discs which I could feel and leaked frequently. This one is the best one I\u2019ve personally tried, but know if you\u2019re built differently then perhaps this one might be problematic for you, while another brand works perfectly. Don\u2019t be afraid to experiment.For heavy bleeders: discs are great for those first couple of days or so. They self-empty when you go to the bathroom, which means you don\u2019t have to ever switch out period products ever again in public bathrooms. Truly, you only need take it out at the end of the day and replace it with a new one! Easy peasy. Beginner friendly since they are disposable. No washing or sterilizing like the cup requires. I know that really grosses out some people. Just toss it. Downside is, you will have to buy them monthly just like most other period products. Not so with the cup (there are discs designed to be reused as well but I do not personally have experience with them, and this review is about this disposable one anyway).Let\u2019s talk disc leakage. It should be minor, unless it gets dislodged during a restroom break. This is my biggest frustration with discs. Sometimes it\u2019s good, but it\u2019s recommended to check its placement after using the bathroom since it sometimes gets out of its place. If you don\u2019t catch it, then it won\u2019t do it\u2019s job. Since they are designed to empty out you may find they might leak with, say, a badly timed sneeze or cough even if it\u2019s in properly. Even so, a light back up pad is normally all you need in such circumstances unless it was very full to begin with. If you feel a leak starting, head to the bathroom. Most of the time that means it is overfull. A light liner is usually all you need for these leaks if caught right away.To sum up: discs are not totally leak-free, but that is actually what makes them so amazing for heavy bleeders, since they freely \u201cleak\u201d into the toilet. Unfortunately they can shift during that process so it\u2019s not totally set-and-forget it, either.Oh wait. Period sex? There is DEFINITELY a learning curve with this. Not so much leak-wise (though I wouldn\u2019t try it if it\u2019s full), but the guy can feel it. Keep that in mind and start slow. There was a BIG difference in this area between this brand and the other one I have tried. This one wasn\u2019t as \u201csharp\u201d, although hubby is still not a fan so I\u2019m not sure I can recommend it.Cups! Cups are virtually leak-free in every sense with the proper fit. They are not nearly as \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d: shorter, taller, wider, skinnier, firmer, and softer versions means you may have to try multiple brands and styles before you find one that\u2019s perfect for you. With a proper fit, you should not be able to feel it. They do not self-empty, which means you have to take them out, dump them, and reinsert if they get full. However, in my experience by day 2 or 3 you can easily go all day without having to dump it. I\u2019m a heavy bleeder. If you are a light bleeder, you should be able to use the cup from day 1 for a leak-free period. Outside of the initial \u201ccavity blood\u201d making its way out (the stuff that was already there before you put the cup in - quite minor), you could honestly go without a liner and be good all day as long as your bleeding isn\u2019t heavy enough to fill it up. After day 2 or 3, I normally do this myself. I wear regular underwear and not even a liner for back up. That\u2019s how leak-free it is. With a cup, there should be no sign of your period until you dump it out at the end of the day. No cramps, no blood. 5 stars. You do have to wash it, so \u201cdealing with it\u201d is messier in that sense, maybe. They say to boil it on a stove to sterilize it between cycles, but I find throwing it in the dishwasher works great (it\u2019s only after I\u2019ve already washed it, but if that freaks you out then do what makes you comfortable). I recommend owning at least two cups to let them \u201cbreathe\u201d between uses: I don\u2019t personally use the same one non-stop for 7 days even with proper washing habits if I can avoid it. To sum up: I hand down prefer cups over discs on lighter days, because I can completely forget about it all day. No \u201creminders\u201d when I go use the bathroom. On heavy days, I sometime do a cup, sometimes I do discs. A disc and light liner is easy to keep in your car or purse if you\u2019re caught off-guard while you\u2019re out.That\u2019s it! Hope this has been helpful. Always happy to share TMI if I think it will help out. Try these discs out, you will love them!",

                "reviewText": "I have been using the Flex discs since 2019. I love what Flex stands for and I love the updates the company has made to their discs since I first started using them. One box lasts me a couple months, maybe more, because they can be worn for up to 12 hours unlike tampons or pads. I really am saving money in the end. They are great for all flow levels, all body shapes and sizes. The flex discs do not discriminate!! They sometimes leak a bit so I do wear a panty liner sometimes. If you do get leaks or are afraid to that you will, remember that you might have to readjust the disc after going to the bathroom or you could be wearing it incorrectly, but with time, you\u2019ll get used to it. I recommend these period discs to my friends who haven\u2019t tried them. They are better than cups in my opinion. I hope this helps anyone wanting to try Flex discs for the first time!",

                "reviewText": "Je suis tomb\u00e9e sur ces disques un peu par hasard et j'ai voulu tenter car j'avais une journ\u00e9e pr\u00e9vue aux thermes et mes r\u00e8gles risquaient d'arriver. Je n'ai jamais pu porter de tampons, et j'ai essay\u00e9 plusieurs cups, mais aucune ne reste en place, donc j'\u00e9tais un peu en panique de ce que je pouvais faire pour ne pas avoir de m\u00e9saventures aux thermes. Et bien s\u00fbr, mes r\u00e8gles sont arriv\u00e9es, la veille de ma sortie, donc \u00e9videmment, j'ai test\u00e9 les disques dans les conditions les plus extr\u00eames, \u00e0 savoir avec un flux tr\u00e8s important, et dans un lieu o\u00f9 je ne pouvais pas porter de serviette en plus. R\u00e9sultat, aucun souci! Une fuite tr\u00e8s, tr\u00e8s l\u00e9g\u00e8re qui a \u00e0 peine t\u00e2ch\u00e9 l'int\u00e9rieur de mon maillot de bain.Seul inconv\u00e9nient r\u00e9el, le retrait du disque est tr\u00e8s sale et \u00e0 \u00e9viter absolument dans des toilettes publiques. J'ai voulu bien faire en changeant de disque en milieu de journ\u00e9e, et comme c'\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois, j'ai d\u00fb mal m'y prendre et le contenu a coul\u00e9 un peu partout... R\u00e9sultat j'avais du sang non seulement sur ma main (normal vu qu'on doit ins\u00e9rer les doigts pour le retirser), sur mon maillot et sur la planche des WCs. Et combl\u00e9e pour moi, il n'y avait pas de petits sachets en plastique pour jeter mon disque dans la petite poubelle, et c'est mission impossible de ranger le disque usag\u00e9 dans l'emballage du nouveau disque.Si on s'y prend bien, il n'y a aucun besoin de changer de cup en journ\u00e9e, m\u00eame pas le premier jour des r\u00e8gles quand on saigne beaucoup, mais comme c'\u00e9tait ma premi\u00e8re fois et que je n'avais pas de protection suppl\u00e9mentaire en cas de fuite, je n'ai pas os\u00e9 tenter de simplement vider la cup en contractant mon p\u00e9rin\u00e9. Je l'ai fait par contre plus tard dans la journ\u00e9e chez moi pour tester, et \u00e7a fonctionne. Quant au retrait du 2e disque, je l'ai fait \u00e0 la maison sous la douche, et comme \u00e7a, pas de risque de renouveller l'\u00e9pisode catastrophe du midi.Bref \u00e7a demande peut \u00eatre un peu de pratique, mais c'est super efficace comme protection, et on ne sent pas du tout le disque en journ\u00e9e (test\u00e9 debout, assise et allong\u00e9e) malgr\u00e9 la taille qui parait imposante.Je recommande vivement pour toute personne qui comme moi ne peut pas porter de tampon ou cups.",
