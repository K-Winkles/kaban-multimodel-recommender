                "reviewText": "I can\u2019t beleive I overlooked this product for so many years, but am relieved that as a last resort I finally found it! I have tried EVERYTHING under the sun for my heavy, uncomfortable and temperamental periods. And EVERY one of them had a huge downside for me.The biggest downsides were leaking, pain inserting or taking out, or the worst one, causing a UTI or bladder irritation by the end :( I don\u2019t know if I have a particularly sensitive vagina or an unusual cervix position, but I know that I always have problems no matter how careful I am and it was very depressing.Cups never fit quite right and hurt to take in out no matter what I tried (also pushed my bladder uncomfortablely), then would leak every time even after doing every suggestion I could find. Tampons I could feel and would hurt when hitting my changing cervix, not to mention bulging out at heavy times causing pain on my urethra, and completely dried me out by the end.Disposable pads were sweaty, stinky and no matter how \u2018green\u2019 would always cause irritation. I had finally just become dependent on cloth reusable pads, which were great for absorption and were the only thing that didn\u2019t overly irritate...I was about to resign myself to them for life. The only things I didn\u2019t like were the constant cleaning of them, feeling uncomfortable on hot days with a bulge in my underwear, and feeling gushing at times...I mean, I trusted them not to fail me but every woman still feels that twinge of fear that it might just keep going past the pad!I was about to try another brand of reusable cup when I saw these. I read a lot of info on them and liked that they sat more like a diaphragm then something in your canal, so I decided to give it a go. Insertion was a BREEZE compared to anything else and after tucked behind my pubic bone I couldn\u2019t feel a thing, it was amazing!! The real test was how long it could hold up this way.I went to a museum with my family and we were walking everywhere for HOURS. I had a small reusable pad on just in case, this was my heaviest day and the cup was going to be put to the ultimate test. I had less cramping than normal (not sure if this was because of the cup or just my cycle) and I FORGOT I was wearing it! That never happens!! I was reminded finally after about 5-6 hours when I had to go to the bathroom. (I would have had 3 bathroom visits with a tampon in that same time!)There was absolutely NO leaking onto my backup pad, I would have just rinsed and reinserted but being in a public stall I just emptied what I could (the whole disc was filled btw) then changed to a new one. I had packed some medical gloves and just used one for easy cleanup and insertion...that is the best idea possible trust me. It is a little messy taking out but with the glove is no problem. I went the rest of the day without incident and then went to the beach the next day same thing.This is the first period in my life (no exaggeration) where I have felt free. Before, it just felt like something was always wrong and I was miserable just trying to prepare for the next mishap. I didn\u2019t have to worry this period. No pain, no leaking, no irritation...I seriously have found my holy grail! If you have tried everything else with no success I strongly suggest giving these a try. I was at the end of my options and am SO glad I did as this is it!Ps- as others have suggested you can also use your muscles to empty the cup by bearing down while on the toilet then just using a finger to push the rim up behind your pubic bone again, this was so helpful in a public restroom when I didn\u2019t have time one time to do the full change routine! As if it couldn\u2019t be better!",

                "reviewText": "I have been a cup user for about 2 years (I finally figured out how to use it during COVID when I didn't have to go anywhere). I like the cup, but it would catch me off guard with leaks entirely too often. While the cup worked better than pads or tampons, it needed constant emptying and sometimes I didn't know it wasn't inserted or sealed properly until it leaked. Since I was used to using a cup, I figured the switch to a disc would be an easy one...and it was even easier than expected!The box comes with 14 discs, which is exactly enough for a 7-day cycle, using 2 per day. I was a bit hesitant when I saw how much wider the disc was vs the cup and I honestly didn't see how it would be possible to not feel something that large. On the first day of my cycle, I inserted the disc while in the shower. It went in so easily that I was sure I did it incorrectly. It was so comfortable and I really didn't feel it at all, so I was really convinced that I did it wrong. I put on a pair of period panties as a backup since I was so positive that it was in wrong and I kept checking for leaks. To my surprise, it really was in correctly and it didn't leak!I read up on how to auto-empty and that has been an absolute game changer for me! Since my heavy days tend to be very heavy, the ability to auto-empty allows one disc to last throughout an entire work day on any day of my cycle with no concerns. Just 'bear down' to push down the pelvic floor and it allows just enough of the disc to push down from behind the pelvic bone to empty. I use one in the morning when I get up and change it in the evening after my shower, which lasts me through the night.I do agree with some of the other reviews in that you need to be comfortable with 'self-exploration' in order to be OK with using a disc. Current cup users should have no issues but those switching from tampons or pads may feel a bit awkward at first. Also, each time I auto-empty, I always check to make sure the disc remains tucked behind the pelvic bone so I can continue the day leak-free. I love this product so much that I am now going to purchase a reusable disc and will never go back to pads or tampons (which never worked properly for me anyway). If you're considering a disc, definitely try this one!!!P.S. I definitely recommend changing this while in the shower unless your goal is to make the bathroom look like a crime scene. The removal process makes quite a mess!",

                "reviewText": "I think this is probably the first review I have ever posted on a product I have brought, but tried these and they are too good to not review.So simple to insert, I actually found it easy than tampons. It was comfortable as soon as it was inserted, never felt it and never leaked.I managed to keep mine in for 7 hours with a heavy flow, and quite a bit of exercise without it leaking. I suppose they are like tampons you eventually learn the length of duration as you go. It leaked a tiny bit after the 7 hours which was obviously a sign to change, but I always wear either a pad or liner anyway:l.Removal was a lot messier than tampons, however nothing major.I\u2019m definitely moving onto these from now on and going to look at a reuse-able one. 100/10!!",
