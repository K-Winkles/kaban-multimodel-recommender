                "reviewText": "Each of my 5 kids weighed in higher than 8 lbs at birth. My smallest was 8.2, and my last was 9.3! I've dealt with weakened muscles for years. My doctor's only advice was to do kegels and give up coffee. As if! Anyway, I've used tampons and pads for years, with some inconsistent luck. I saw this product and decided to give it a try, although it seemed far-fetched that a little disc would do anything. It inserts like a tampon but I think the plastic applicator is bulky and a little uncomfortable. Once it's been deployed I was shocked that I couldn't feel it! My first day with it was borderline miraculous to me. I still use a pad to catch small leaks if they occur. I don't use the string because I can reach it ok, like removing a diaphragm. I don't use it at home because I worry my muscles will get used to it and it won't be as effective over time? That may not be true but that's my worry. I insert it when I'm heading out on errands or other activities and it just plain Works! I went out of town for a few days and forgot to pack the applicator. I simply folded it in half (again, like a diaphragm) and easily inserted it without the applicator. I still experience a bit of leaking, but after years of office work I have a bad habit of waiting too long to use the restroom so part of that is my bad. But if you can use a tampon - you should give this a try. I 100% recommend this product. \ud83d\ude0a",

I thought I finally found something that will work. But the second day there was leakage and I was so disappointed. I thought maybe I inserted it wrong. So I tried it again a 3rd time and it was like I was using nothing. I checked to see if maybe the rubber/plastic pessary thing lost it's shape or something. Regardless. it didn't work for me.",

                "reviewText": "I have dealt with bladder leakage for years and as I get older I'm finding the problem getting worse. Last week I purchased this product because being active is getting harder for me because of my problem. I also purchased a a disposable product by another brand that does the same thing. They insert in like a tampon and push against the pelvic floor so that accidental leakage is minimized. I was very hopeful for this one because it's reusable for up to a month and much cheaper than the disposable product. I started having a bad cough before the product arrived and if you've ever experienced bladder leakage, you know that coughing is a big problem, so it's the perfect time for me to test this product out! The first day that I tried this product I realized I was still having leakage and according to reviews that I've read, you may have to push it in more or pull it down some. I'm still trying to find the right location for me, but I have noticed that some times when I'm wearing it, I have no leakage at all. Other times I have some minor leakage but it's no where near the amount of leakage that I endure when I don't have anything at all in. I still need to use the incontinence pads to catch any leakage that occurs but the problem is much more under control as long as I'm using my Revive device. Overall I'm happy with this product. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I do wish it were more dependable. I did find that the other brand's disposable product stopped the leakage completely but I'm still holding onto hope that I will find the perfect location to wear this so that it would do the same. It is a much more affordable option.",

                "reviewText": "EDIT: My Recommendations:1. order 1. If it works for you, order a second so you always have one loaded ready to go. I'm now going to add 2 to my auto delivery.2. PAY ATTENTION TO HOW IT COMES PACKED INSIDE CARRYING CASE. Even take a photo. I futzed with loading the string until I realized I was making it harder than it is.3. Even if you wear underwear, this is FAR simpler, more comfortable, more convenient and less expensive!...................I've been using Poise inserts for years. I have incontinence when laughing, etc. I don't want to wear pads because they're gross and I prefer going commando anyway.Poise inserts are impossible to find in stores and prices are outrageous.I tried this on a trip, and once I got the hang of it, it's awesome!You have to insert with the ridges of the applicator facing straight up or it won't be in place correctly, I know it's correct if I can pee freely.You also want to make sure the silicone piece stays straight and doesn't turn to one side or the other when inserting into the applicator for it to work well, but that's not a big deal if you just take your time and watch.No more carrying these tampon-like things. Less expensive by far. Yeah, the string gets wet, but that happens with regular tampons and with Poise. Plus I always felt gross leaving Poise in. This can be worn 12 hours. I have and I never even know it's there.Stringing is really easy if you just follow the directions, by the way. It looks like it should be more difficult but it isn't.I will save so much money!",
