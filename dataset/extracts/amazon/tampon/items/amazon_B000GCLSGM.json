It's hard to find cardboard applicators now. I get that plastic glides more easily, but I have a heavy enough flow that it's just not an issue to use cardboard. Plus, cardboard breaks down and plastic doesn't. In a world with plastic straw bans, why not go after plastic applicators? Anyway, these are my go to, and not always in stores these days.",
