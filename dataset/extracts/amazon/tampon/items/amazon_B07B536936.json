                "reviewText": "Can\u2019t seem to find OB in stores lately so tried these. Out of organic tampons I have tried (only Lola and OB organic), these were the most absorbent and shed the least. But still left some cotton fibers where you don\u2019t want to find them! not terrible though but you still gotta check. OB organic sheds worse.. Lola\u2019s I tried had an applicator which I don\u2019t prefer but were the least absorbent out of the 3. actually they soak through pretty fast. As for Cora I would use again but not converted as of yet. Non organic OB works the best for me with no shedding, but also obviously not being organic could be a drawback!",
