She has used Kotex as well as Tempax and while both have some great products, she is liking some of the new products from Kotex even more.U By Kotex Tampons Sleek Super Absorbency Tampons are one of the best protection plastic applicator tampons for heavy days with amazing comfort and convenience. Typically, she needs Super Absorbency only 1-2 days in the cycle and she find these one very convenient and comfortable. She is home-maker which means she has to pretty much work whole day for chasing after kids and to maintain home and she likes comfort of these ones. Tampon opens all around, conforming to body. The absorbent core locks away any fluid. I have no complains in terms of absorbency or comfort is concerned.This particular package comes with Super absorbency tampons and they are unscented. It comes in individually wrapped 18 packages which are easy to store in purse and easy to carry. The packaging is special as it is quieter and resalable.IMPORTANT NOTE:Tampons come in different absorbency levels depending on menstrual flow such as Light, Regular, Super, Super Plus and Ultra. Many people think that selecting the best absorbency level is better, but this is not wise. Tampons carry rare risk of getting Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) and hence manufacturers recommend choosing minimum required absorbency level to control menstrual flow to reduce the risk of getting TSS.",

                "reviewText": "I don't care about what color these are, I just care about comfort and reliability. These are comfortable and totally painless to insert and I forget about it once it has disappeared ;) For Super absorbency tampons, I can easily go a full 4 - 8 hours without leaks but I have a light to medium heavy flow at the peak of my cycle. I like the option of using higher absorbency tampons overnight so I don't have issues and on days where I know I can't change them out as often as I would have to with light or regular absorbency types.",

They are great for almost any day of the menstrual cycle. The applicator is easy to use, likely in part due to the fact that it is indeed a 'full-size' applicator. These are, simply put, great tampons that get the job done!",

These are durable and easy to carry around with you. The pack is small but it's a good one to give this brand a try if you're not sure what you need absorbance wise or if you will like this version. I would say it's on par with other top brand names out there. Basically the same product.",
