                "reviewText": "I don't have issues with the applicator, since I've used these before and am used to how it works. Also, I know how it's going to be when you take it out when it's kind of dry, again used to it. But my issue is something else. I used to like these a lot, but this time it seems to absorb on the string and complete saturate it before even absord on basically any of the tampon, causing worries about and string leakage even outside of the extra long and wide liners. It's unfortunate because I bought 3 boxes of L,R, AND S, at the same time. I hope they're not all like that, because that's $30 down the drain and like 90 tampons I can't use.",

                "reviewText": "The only thing that could make this better is a multi-pack with varied absorbancy levels. For the first two days, I needed the super plus or I had to change my tampon every 5 hours before slight leakage. Which is fine, as it isn't advisable to wear a tampon longer than 6-8 hours. The last three days were perfect. No leaks, no mess. These are comfortable, non irritating and easy to insert. Removal is a breeze and doesn't hurt at all, even when semi dry. I love them and won't go back to sea sponges, traditional tampons, pads or period underwear. Awesome!!",
