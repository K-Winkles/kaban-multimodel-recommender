What I've noticed on the market is that a lot of sanitary and tampon brands have a lot of chemicals and fragrances that'll unbalance a woman's pH. With Cora, I don't have to worry about that. Their products are organic (so no crazy chemicals) and no fragrances, which I love. Not to mention they donate sanitary products to young girls in need. Like you can't go wrong with this brand. I highly recommend using the Cora brand, especially if you've had a bad experience with tampons in the past.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using CORA tampons for like the last year or so and have never ordered any but I saw that they were cheaper. Tell me why I received them and they came in plastic packaging and were noticeably bigger. The regular is almost as big as the Super used to be and the Super is wayy bigger. The light ones are close to how they used to be but are def bigger. I don't know if this is like a dupe version and I got scammed or something. They could have changed the way they make them but idk.. They are not impossibly big or anything, I am still going to use them but the size difference is kinda noticeable (coming from someone who doesn't tend to notice these kinds of things).",

The hexagonal shape of the tampon after it soaks up blood is super painless to remove compared to other tampon brand shapes. It holds the same absorbency as other tampon brands that are non organic and definitely make me feel better about using them.",
