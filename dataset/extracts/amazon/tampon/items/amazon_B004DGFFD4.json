                "reviewText": "I wanted to use these for a few menstrual cycles before I wrote my review so I could really give them a good test and using more than just one box for comparison. I had read the reviews about the punch hole in the cardboard applicators being a problem and the tubes being hard to push up once inserted. I am in my late 30's and have used Tampax brand tampons with the cardboard applicator exclusively since I was 16.First, the cardboard tubes are thicker than the Tampax ones which means you can really grip them tightly and not worry about crushing anything. There is, indeed, a punch hole in each tube that goes through both cardboard tubes (the outer one and the inner one that pushes the actual tampon out of the applicator) BUT I listened to a previous reviewer and I pushed the tampon out just enough to get beyond the hole but NOT enough to where the tampon is coming out over the cardboard that opens up and out around the top of the tampon. The top of the cardboard applicator has, for lack of a better description, petals like a flower that come up and over the top of the tampon. If you push the applicator up just a little bit to allow that punch hole to be gotten past the petals do not open up. I have not had any issues with inserting these tampons, the applicator getting stuck, or them hurting.I have noticed a DRASTIC decrease in my cramps since changing to these tampons. I love the peace of mind knowing that these are organic and my body is no longer getting the toxins put it in from the Tampax tampons. How I wish I would have discovered these YEARS ago!I flush the entire tampon, applicator, and wrapper and have had no issues with that.I have not had any leakage issues and the tampons are as easy to remove as the Tampax ones.I highly recommend these tampons to anyone. It is well worth the price and once you realize you can really grab on to the applicator and you get past that little punch in the cardboard you are good to go.",

                "reviewText": "The ad claims this product is super absorbent, protects from leaks, the applicator Is comfortable, the tampon is soft on the skin, and it\u2019s organic. There\u2019s so much wrong.The product is not absorbent. I got the super plus and after an hour of use I start leaking onto the pad. It doesn\u2019t even expand much, just sort of opens up where the material was pressed together, the overall thickness doesn\u2019t increase. I tried using two at a time, they were enough for an hour and a half.The applicator is rough where it should be smooth (the tip) and smooth and sleek where it is supposed to be rough (the holding point and the pusher). The tip is scratching my skin, and when I try to push the tampon in, the applicator is too slippery to hold it even with dry hands. The tampon is tight inside the applicator and only starts moving after a significant pressure is applied at which point the applicator starts slipping through fingers.I gave up on the applicator after several attempts and tried to insert the tampon without it, it is super scratchy and not soft at all.I hope that it is at least truly organic and will decompose in the landfill quickly, since that\u2019s where the whole 6 pack is going. I absolutely regret buying this, I wish I could return the unopened packs.Btw I also got their daily pads, they are equally ridiculous. The absorption is poor, the top layer gets detached from the rest of the pad once wet, and also it comes with so much packaging it defies the purpose of buying Earth safe products: the pads are on paper liners stuck to plastic individual wrappers inside a plastic bag inside a box. Quite the trashy onion this one.",
