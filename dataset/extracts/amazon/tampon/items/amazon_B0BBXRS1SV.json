I have only 2 suggestions: 1, the bag should be a bit larger. It will be a struggle to stuff larger sanitary napkins into this. 2, I wish the bag were more opaque. There is no way to discretely dispose of a used tampon in this without being able to see exactly what it is, without having to first wrap it in toilet paper, which defeats the purpose. If you don't care what can be seen in your trash, then it doesn't matter.",

                "reviewText": "These little translucent plastic feminine care disposal bags are really handy. They come in a small box, perfect to fit in a purse, and they do not rattle or crinkle like crazy when using them, I like that they are translucent so you can dispose of your feminine care items discretely. They do not have adhesion to them, which would be an improvement, but nonetheless, fold the edge over and toss it into the trash.",
