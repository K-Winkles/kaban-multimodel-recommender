        "description": "Our regular organic tampons are made with a rolled wadding of long-fibre organic cotton \u2013 designed to gently absorb menstrual flow and expand widthways. We only make organic tampons because most are made from a mix of rayon and non-organic cotton, and are commonly chlorine-bleached. Tampons often have a plastic wrapper, contain perfumes and even dyes. Rayon is a highly absorbent fibre which rapidly absorbs menstrual blood but at the same time can also dry out the natural protective mucous lining of the vagina. No-one should be exposed to pesticide residues, phthalates, azo-dyes and dioxins, especially in such a sensitive and absorptive part of the body. Know exactly what you put in your body.",

                "reviewText": "I used OB tampons for years in an attempt to reduce the amount of waste produced by my tampon habit. After you get used to the lack of an applicator, it's really no big deal. Then, after considering the health implications of putting synthetic materials and chemically treated cotton into my body, I made the switch to organic tampons about 10 years ago. Not only would I rather have organic cotton in by body than synthetics for obvious reasons of preferring natural materials, but I've also read that they pose less risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome. I've tried a number of brands, but have found NatraCare to be my favorite for their ease of use, price, and ready availability on Amazon.One of my favorite things about these is that they are constructed well. As they absorb fluid, they unfold in a flower sort of shape that catches everything very efficiently. I can count on them to work, no matter what I'm doing. The tiny little individually wrapped tampons are also super discreet, and can fit into any little pocket without causing a scene. I've been using these for nearly 3 years, and will continue to buy!",

                "reviewText": "These take a little getting used to when you are used to using plastic applicators. It's just a concentrated cotton swab really. It takes getting used to putting in correctly. They are also quite small when compared to the \"super\" size or super + that the big brands have. They are literally half the size compared to the pearls. Nonetheless, they still work when properly inserted. Another caveat is they are individually wrapped in tight plastic which is difficult to get out at times and a nuisance to deal with the multiple pieces of plastic in your hands in the bathroom, while still needing to place the tampon in. I am happy that this is organic cotton so I will stick with this until something better comes along.",

Pretty self explanatory on how to apply this. I am actually impress for how small the thing is that is absorbs good amount for medium bleeders. I don't think it would be good for heavy users if so, you'll definitely change it more often. As for no applicator, I don't see the big deal. Its really fine, nothing difficult to apply it. Overall, glad I am reducing my waste consumption.",

Absorbency seems the same for all the tampons I\u2019ve tried, regardless of brand (and I typically use regulars through super pluses depending on the flow), but something about other tampons, even the natural ones, causes irritation (I have very sensitive skin and a lot of allergies), but not these. I also prefer the ones without an applicator (because you can carry them around much more discreetly, not to mention reducing all that excess waste).",
