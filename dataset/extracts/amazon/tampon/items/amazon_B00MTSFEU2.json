The long string makes it uncomfortable to wear if i go swim or jog. And #2. The tampon is soo teeny tiny. Quite disapoint in the brand, but i guess i will use them until they are gone. What a waste of 9 bucks. I prefer tampax pears design. I will say it is super duper easy to slide in though and you get soo many in one box.",
