        "description": "Natracare super plus absorbency organic tampons are made with a rolled wadding of long-fibre organic cotton \u2013 designed to gently absorb menstrual flow and expand widthways. Natracare makes organic tampons because most are made from a mix of rayon and non-organic cotton, and are commonly chlorine-bleached. Tampons often have a plastic wrapper, contain perfumes and even dyes. Rayon is a highly absorbent fibre which rapidly absorbs menstrual blood but at the same time can also dry out the natural protective mucous lining of the vagina. No-one should be exposed to pesticide residues, phthalates, azo-dyes and dioxins, especially in such a sensitive and absorptive part of the body. Know exactly what you put in your body.",
