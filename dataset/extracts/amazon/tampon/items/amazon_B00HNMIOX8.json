Veeda Non-Applicator Tampons are made with ultra-absorbent all-natural 100% cotton for reliable, leak-proof protection. Designed with specialized grooves for added absorption and all-natural cotton string for easy removal. Available in: Lite, Regular, Super & Super Plus with Compact BPA-Free Applicator or Applicator Free Synthetic and/or scented period care products can irritate the sensitive skin of the vulva. Veeda tampons are natural, hypoallergenic and dermatologically tested, which is very important for women's health. In fact, statistics show that yeast infections are less likely to occur with natural products that contain no harsh chemicals and fragrances. Veeda tampons are made with naturally soft, absorbent 100% pure GMO-Free cotton (that\u2019s it, nothing else!) ensuring that your body only meets with the purest, irritation free ingredients. Our 100% natural cotton is sourced directly from a global network of leading cotton traders and all cotton is cleansed with an oxygen cleansing process, not chlorine-bleached, for a healthier eco-friendlier product. This process removes all dirt and impurities including any synthetic matter and this is the exact same process by which all organic cotton is cleansed with, to ensure it also has no synthetic substances. This ensures that the final tampons are truly 100% natural cotton. Veeda tampons are lab-tested for over 250 harmful chemicals and contain no wood or synthetic fibres, no additives and no dioxins. Another advantage to using 100% pure, hypoallergenic cotton, is that cotton does not contribute to the growth of the bacteria that causes Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), irritation and allergic reactions.",

Yet, somehow, there is extremely low awareness among women of what ingredients are used in their sanitary protection products and what implications they may have for their health. We believe that natural products are better for you and for our planet. We also believe that when it comes to products that touch the skin, particularly in the most intimate parts of the body, it\u2019s important to know exactly where it came from and how it got there. This is why we are committed to ensuring that all of our products contain ONLY pure, hypoallergenic, 100% natural cotton with No Nasty Chemicals and No Dyes. Unlike other brands, our cotton is grown naturally, not manufactured or altered. Plus, all our products are gently cleansed with oxygen and are chlorine-free. Conventional period care products from well-known brands can be made from blends of bleached cotton and/or synthetic products. They can also contain dioxins from the bleaching process, herbicide residues, synthetic chemicals, artificial fragrances, and dyes. We want to make sure that our products are kinder to the earth in every way possible. After learning how conventionally made feminine care products affected our body and environment, Veeda was created. The average woman uses 11,000 feminine care products in her lifetime; this fact alone keeps us inspired to create a top of line sustainable process when manufacturing our products. Veeda products are made with pure, hypoallergenic, 100% natural cotton. Our cotton is grown naturally, not manufactured or altered. Both our tampons and pads are gently cleansed with oxygen and are chlorine-free. Veeda tampons are made only with 100% Natural Cotton and have No Nasty Chemicals, No Synthetics, and No Dyes. Knowing the facts, consider making a better choice by making Veeda your go-to natural period care brand.",

I just had previously only seen them with a wasteful plastic applicator. I\u2019m so glad to be able to buy them without an applicator. They can be discreetly carried in a change purse or pocket, and only a small amount of plastic wrapper for waste. The absorbency is equivalent to Cora or OB applicator free tampons.",
