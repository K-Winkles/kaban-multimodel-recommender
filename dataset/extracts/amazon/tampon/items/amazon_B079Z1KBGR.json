                "reviewText": "The absorbency is comparable to that of any Tampax or Playtex brands in my opinion. Packaging is a little flimsy, but I believe that's because of it's recyclability. Comfort could be better, if we're talking about the applicator. I've read lots of complaints about the applicators \"deployment\" difficulties... I've only ever had it \"not properly deploy\" once, and that was one of the 'light' sized ones. I've been using this brand for over a year, so I think the odds are good for having no problems.",

                "reviewText": "I have tried MANY different natural feminine products...and CORA by far is the best!!! The absorbency rate is great, although sometimes may feel like I need to switch out slightly sooner, I am OK with this. They are super comfortable. I have only had trouble with one of the applicators one time, and it was partly due to user error. I also like that with each purchase they help another female in need by sending feminine hygiene products. I wish that I could choose how many of each absorption levels I needed, but regardless I will continue to purchase CORA for my feminine hygiene needs. Thank you!!!",
