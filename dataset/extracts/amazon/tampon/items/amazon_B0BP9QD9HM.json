                "reviewText": "These are great at doing what they are meant to do, but the individual wrapping has gotten worse. When these first came to the market, the sticker would open the pouch and you could also use the sticker to close the pouch to neatly dispose of the applicator. The sticker can no longer be removed without tearing the wrapper so disposal is not as clean and easy as before and the wrapper is harder to open.",
