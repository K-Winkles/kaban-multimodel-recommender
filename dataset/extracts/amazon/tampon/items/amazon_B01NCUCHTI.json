Tampax Pearl Tampons have a special LeakGuard Braid to help stop leaks before they happen, while a Smooth Removal Layer allows for easy removal. Plus, FormFit Protection gently expands to fit your individual shape. How long can I wear a tampon? You can wear a tampon for up to eight hours, but never leave it in for longer than that. If you usually sleep longer, set an alarm or just use a pad instead. How do I know which absorbency to use? Choosing the right tampon absorbency can make a big difference to be comfortable and avoid leaks. Take the Tampax Quiz on Tampax's website to learn more. What makes Tampax Pearl different from Tampax Pocket Pearl? Both Tampax Pearl and Tampax Pocket Pearl offer outstanding protection with a LeakGuard Braid to help prevent leaks. The main difference is that Tampax Pocket Pearl is compact in size so it fits in your pocket. When ready to use, extend the compact applicator to make it a full-size one.",

Waaaaaay to many regulars, not enough balance with the super and super+ in my opinion. I unfortunately could not see the numbers in the images and no where on the page does it say how many of each you get. You get 18 regulars, and only 8 each of super and super+. I just wish I\u2019d known that before buying because that would have been a pass for me.",
