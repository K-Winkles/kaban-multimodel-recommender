Plus, FormFit Protection gently expands to fit your individual shape. How long can I wear a tampon? You can wear a tampon for up to eight hours, but never leave it in for longer than that. If you usually sleep longer, set an alarm or just use a pad instead. How do I know which absorbency to use? Choosing the right tampon absorbency can make a big difference to be comfortable and avoid leaks. Take the Tampax Quiz on Tampax's website to learn more. What makes Tampax Pearl different from Tampax Pocket Pearl? Both Tampax Pearl and Tampax Pocket Pearl offer outstanding protection with a LeakGuard Braid to help prevent leaks. The main difference is that Tampax Pocket Pearl is compact in size so it fits in your pocket. When ready to use, extend the compact applicator to make it a full-size one.",

Which I know that's not too great for you but oh well there are worse things ya know. I mean think about it, I'm kinda being sustainable, the less I use, less waste is produced. I had found out recently that at the waste plant, whatever you call it, they sort through our waste ya know, and they have to dig out each individual tampon because they really aren't flushable. But this fact not only made me think about my waste production through my monthly ritual, but how the movie finding nemo lied to me also it makes no sense. I was fed this idea that all toilets led to the ocean, and how that was one of their plans to escape, but if that was true there would be a whole ocean full of tampons. Now I wonder how many ultras it would take to absorb the whole ocean. That would be a good promo/marketing thing. Someone write that down. But in all seriousness when I flushed my dead beta fish pickles I really thought that he would go back to the ocean, even though he was a freshwater fish, I thought maybe the saltyness could revitalize him, like electrocute him. But all in all don't trust that tiny clown fish nemo. Trust in the fact that the Ultras are the way to go.",

I do recommend using a pad combined with the tampon just for any accidents and I\u2019ve never been able to fully avoid leaks, I don\u2019t know if user error or product error but with a pad I don\u2019t feel the bleeding in comparison to pad alone.",

This one DOES work as well as the OG Kotex super plus but with some discomfort. I do rely on these for the first couple of days and they have held up to a monster flow with minimal leakage.
