                "media_text": "Find your Flow Combo Your period is different every day of your flow, so why wear the same tampon absorbency? Tampax Radiant tampons come in different absorbencies, so you can move up or down as needed. A lot of women experience a heavier flow in the beginning of their period, and then it gets lighter toward the end. So you might want to think about switching between different absorbencies. If the tampon reaches full absorption before four hours, you need a higher absorbency like Super or Super Plus for extra protection. If there is still white fiber showing after four to eight hours, you need a lower absorbency. Use for a maximum of eight hours. FAQ How do I use a Tampax Radiant Tampon Applicator? Tampax Radiant tampons have a textured grip applicator for easy and comfortable insertion. With the removal string hanging down, insert the outer tube at a slight upward angle, toward the small of your back. Gently slide the applicator all the way in until your fingers touch your body. Then push the inner tube all the way into the outer tube until the ends of both tubes are even. Place the used applicator back into the wrapper and throw it away. How does Tampax Radiant stop leaks? Tampax Radiant has a LeakGuard Braid to help stop leaks before they happen. What makes Tampax Pocket Radiant different from Tampax Radiant? Tampax Pocket Radiant compact tampons offer the same protection as Tampax Radiant tampons, but are more discreet. They're a full-size tampon in a smaller extendable applicator.

                "reviewText": "Ok, it's a little awkward deciding to write a review of a feminine product, which is why I guess there aren't any on here! But as a woman, I know it would help me tremendously to have another woman's opinion so here goes!I've been using this specific product for a while now and will not go back to any previous versions Tampax has put out. The Pearl line was great, but this specific product is perfect. I haven't had any issues with this product at all, it's simple, easy to use, and perfect for women and girls alike.What makes this so great is not what you would imagine though. yes, the applicator is comfortable and sleek and simple and works terrifically well, but what really stands out to me is the applicator bag. Most tampons have a pouch that is either sealed on both ends or peels open at one, and this pouch has a re-sealable tab that allows you to easily remove the tampon/applicator from the pouch and then easily and efficiently place the applicator back in and securely seal it for disposal! Really, this seems like a feature all tampons should have! I'm personally so happy they came out with this idea and executed it so perfectly well!The re-sealable tab really does reseal tightly and securely and really is super easy to open. There is no fumbling to try and get it open, and it provides a clean, sanitary disposal option which seems like it should have always been a top priority for product designers in this industry!I'm extremely happy with this brand and this product and in general the duopack concept is perfect as well. I can't imagine trying any other option after finding this, and so far I haven't wanted to!I would recommend this for both women experienced with these products as well as for young girls just experimenting to see what works and is comfortable for them. I have sons, but if i had a daughter I would be buying her these as well!(Phew! That wasn't so bad!)",

The radiant line provides a neat way to wrap the applicator, or the used tampon, then seal it before disposal. Also, the applicator glides very smoothly, as does any bodily fluids adhering to it, so be sure to hold the used applicator over the toilet or wipe it with tissue before inserting in the plastic sleeve for disposal. I like the radiant line more than the compact plastics, but I only use the deoderant free version, since the others irritate me. I wish Tampax made a Super Plus/Super/Regular combo in this line; the lites are really not something I use often.",

You can also put the used (eeeeew!!) cartridge back in it easily and seal it up before tossing it in the trash.The grip is AWESOME. Even if you WANTED to drop it or lose your grip while...you know....inserting it, you couldn't! I hated it when things were too...slippery (eeeew!) and you lost your grip. Fear no more!!These things last forever, are easy to grip and are very nice on the...well, you know.Buy them. Buy them now.",

It even has a light scent!They're SO much cheaper than any of the other ones sold in our local Duane Reades / CVS and perform so much better. I'm a loyal fan and subscribe to monthly delivery now.",
