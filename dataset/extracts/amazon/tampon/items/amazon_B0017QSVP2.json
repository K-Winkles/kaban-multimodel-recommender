I recently purchase a box off Amazon and had no tearing issues. The pads are great super comfortable and surprisingly absorbent. Feels like I\u2019m wearing nothing at allI liked them so much I went to sprouts (a store they advertise as being sold physically in) and in the store I got this sad sappy wrapper. If you get this wrapper your pad is not fake, it\u2019s not damaged it\u2019s just the new changes. Picture in image is store bought not Amazon purchased. You could get either or when your purchase as seen from reviews.My fault with this new packaging is the only thing that brings it down from 5 stars for me. It\u2019s really hard to pull it off",

I've been using them for two months now between two sizes and one box should last for two months if you use the long and regular alternatively.My body feels better, I don't cramp as much, which is crazy, and I feel better I'm leaving a cleaner planet for my children.This is an investment as well as improvement to the quality of my life.

However, this doesn't happen with these natural and comfortable pads. I cannot stress enough how much I recommend this brand! Buying them online is also discreet and easy to stock up, they sell out quickly in stores!Make a difference for the earth, they are biodegradable!!!! AMAZING!! (And this same brand offer tampons, so much better for your health and the health of mother nature. They are flushable! So very safe!)HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",
