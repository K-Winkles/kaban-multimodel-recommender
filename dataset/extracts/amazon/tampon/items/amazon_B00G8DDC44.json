        "description": "If you\u2019re looking for uncompromised period protection, you\u2019ve come to the right place. Always Maxi Pads feature the Always advanced 3X Protection System to give you up to 100% leak free comfort throughout your days and nights. RapidDRY works to wick away gushes fast to absorb more than you may need. The LeakGUARD core locks in leaks for long-lasting protection to keep you fresh and clean, and SecurelyFITS helps the pad stay in place throughout no matter what you do. Make sure that you are getting the right protection from your pad, using the wrong pad size can lead to leaks. Always Maxi Pads come in a range of sizes fit your flow and size perfectly depending on your needs. If you have a light flow or need a teen-sized pad, then we would recommend using our Always Maxi Pad size 1 to 3. If you have a heavy flow or want overnight protection, then we recommend using our size 4 or 5 Always Maxi Pad. Whether you have a heavy flow or a light one, Always has you covered. Also remember that all Always Maxi Pads are FSA & HSA eligible! Check with your FSA or HSA plan provider for information on the coverage of period care products.",

These were the only ones that would be delivered the next day compared to others. They showed as being super absorbent and during the first few days its nothing but stained underwear if im not consistently changing them.These show as nighttime wear but given that I would only be using these for the heavy first few days I thought they would work and to my surprise they did.....however I am beginning to understand why these were met for nighttime because the diaper eques feeling of them and look while I wear them is not something meant for good lighting.You can feel them, point blank. There is a huge dent in the back when you wear them and slightly noticeable in jeans or slacks. I did wear a sweater that covered my back so it wasn't as noticeable but if your unable to do so then definitely recommend you are not outside or with people.They do however soak up everything. Never once did I stain or bleed through which was a plus and I guess a good balance when it essentially feels like a diaper.I do still have plenty so I will continue to use them until I run out but I will only do as stated and use at nighttime or if I hit despair again and have nothing else available.",
