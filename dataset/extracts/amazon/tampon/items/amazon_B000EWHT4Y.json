        "description": "Healthier by nature. 100% Cotton. Certified organic. Non-chlorine bleached. Why organic tampons? In 1989, Natracare was developed as a direct response to health and environmental concerns about dioxin pollution by chlorine bleaching, the use of rayon in tampons, and the extensive use of pesticides on conventionally grown cotton. For over 15 years, Natracare has been trusted by women who see the good sense in making a natural choice in tampons, pads, panty liners and feminine wipes for their monthly cycle. It makes sense to choose a tampon that is made from only certified organic cotton to avoid unnecessary exposure to chemical residuals and synthetics. Natracare Organic cotton tampons and chemical free pads are high quality products made from only pure and natural materials that are not chlorine bleached and are free of rayon, plastics and synthetic materials. Made in Germany.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m a relatively health conscious individual and have been gradually making changes into a healthier lifestyle.I kind of always knew how awful regular tampons were for you (I mean it\u2019s terrible that us ladies have been sticking bleach and pesticide infested cotton up our lady parts for YEARS. I mean, no wonder so many woman have ovarian cancer!), but was always pushing off making the switch because of the price of these things! I mean, I can get 5 cancer sticks (aka regular tampons) at Cosco for the price of one of these. And that certainly adds up over time! But then again, so does the cost of harming the body with all those chemicals. Urggg.So I finally decided that well-being was vastly more important than a few extra bucks each month and thus, made the switch these little bullet looking things, which I call 22\u2019s. Check out the pics and tell me it doesn\u2019t look like the bullet for a 22! I got the kind without the applicator, because it\u2019s less waste for the environment and (ok I admit it) mostly because it was cheaper.I was actually kind of freaking out about the no applicator thing (I mean how gross that I have to \u2026well, I\u2019ll leave out the details). Well, it hasn\u2019t been nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I mean, it took a few times for me to get used to it, but again, definitely not as bad as I thought it would be. Actually, I\u2019ve found that an AWESOME perk about the no applicator is that it\u2019s SO small and compact that it takes up virtually no room. Stick one or 2 in my pocket on a night out and I\u2019m good to go!Last thing to make note of... Again, it might be TMI but heck, what did you expect to get from a tampon review?! So before I had reformed my ways and was still buying cancer sticks, it would sometimes get itchy up there in lady world and would just feel \u2026hard to describe\u2026itchy/uncomfortable/not clean. Since I\u2019ve switched, that never happens anymore! Yay! I\u2019m pretty sure it was my ladyhood revolting at me in the presence of such unclean cancer sticks.I was NOT paid to do this review or given any free stuff. I did it because I\u2019m hoping that more ladies will make the switch. I know it\u2019s more expensive but your well-being is vastly more important than a few dollars. Trust me, I\u2019m an expert ;)Anyways, hope you enjoyed the review and that this helped. Please leave comments or questions if you have any and I\u2019d be SUPER appreciative if you\u2019d be so kind as to rate my review :DP.S. A few people commented about this being so hard to unwrap. They must have updated the product because it now has an easy peel flap in the middle. I took a pic so you can see what I mean.Xoxo",

                "reviewText": "Organic cotton tampons are more expensive than rayon, but they're made with fewer chemicals and the fibers cause less trauma to the vaginal walls so I use them religiously. This one is a great product, easy to use and transport, and since I bought a case I won't need to buy tampons for over a year (FYI, I do the same with the Natracare breathable panty liners -- the only ones that don't leave me with a yeast infection since standard liners with plastic build up moisture).The case is pretty compact, so storage isn't a problem and I get to enjoy both savings and convenience of not buying tampons monthly. Keep in mind these do not have an applicator, but I prefer this because they're more discreet (I can hide one in the palm of my hand or pants pocket) and also create less waste than the applicator versions.",

                "reviewText": "I used O.B. before. Then suddenly that brand became unavailable EVERYWHERE. I hate plastic and applicators and all the waste. I hate the tampons that grow longer instead of wide.....BlahThese are comparable to O.B.. I did have a little less cramping...but not much. They are a bit more solid....almost to hard to absorb at first...I found that if I loosened it a bit by sticking my finger in the string end and scrunching it a bit, it made it a bit softer and more absorbent right away.Have switched to a cup now, but still carry these around for emergencies. Very nice product.",

                "reviewText": "These tampons are really good. It takes a little getting used to not having an applicator, but it's not a big deal.My mind is at ease knowing the fibers are organically grown and do not contain harmful chemicals.They can be a bit tricky to open at times, but mostly they are excellent. I also love the fact that buying them in a large quantity means I have plenty on hand and do not have to reorder frequently. Buying the case is definitely worth the investment and saves money.",
