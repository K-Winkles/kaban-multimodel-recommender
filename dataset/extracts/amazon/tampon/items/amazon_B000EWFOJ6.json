        "description": "Healthier by nature. 100% Cotton. Certified organic. Non-chlorine bleached. Why organic tampons? In 1989, Natracare was developed as a direct response to health and environmental concerns about dioxin pollution by chlorine bleaching, the use of rayon in tampons, and the extensive use of pesticides on conventionally grown cotton. For over 15 years, Natracare has been trusted by women who see the good sense in making a natural choice in tampons, pads, panty liners and feminine wipes for their monthly cycle. It makes sense to choose a tampon that is made from only certified organic cotton to avoid unnecessary exposure to chemical residuals and synthetics. Natracare Organic cotton tampons and chemical free pads are high quality products made from only pure and natural materials that are not chlorine bleached and are free of rayon, plastics and synthetic materials. Made in Germany.",

                "reviewText": "Before I got any further, I have no clue why it took me so long to start using these natural tampons. A few friends have been recommending them to me for years but I thought most of what they bragged about was advertising. Really, these are the best tampons around, especially for girls like me who have a very heavy flow. They last for hours, are comfortable, and I have had less cramps and leaks since switching over to Natracare. I truly believe that the chemicals and synthetic items used in Tampax and other brands are now designed to make us use more and buy other products. I also LOVE that they are so tiny. No more carrying a giant purse during that time of the month to carry tampons for the day, or dragging a purse with me while walking. These are tiny enough to easily fit 2 of these tampons in a jean pocket while you are on the go. They are truly are a girl's best friend! While they seem pricey at first glance, they are better in the long run since you use less product and they are much easier to manage.",

Fortunately for us, they're also not all tied together in a nice tampon bouquet, but I guess you could do that at home too. The quality is exactly the same as all the other natracare tampons I've purchased at my local co-op. The boxes of 20 each arrived in fine condition packed within a larger box. This supply will last me longer than a year, is significantly more convenient than going to the store every month, and is a better financial deal. Also - I would use a menstrual cup but haven't found a model more comfortable and convenient than tampons but if I had I'd probably be doing that instead (cotton is hard on the environment).",

I appreciate the compact size, it made the product easy to store, carry, and pack for hikes/day trips. I never lost/wasted the product due to the tab opening. If there was a time when I \"struggled\" with the packaging, I took a deep breath and pulled the little plastic flap a little harder.I'm looking forward to my next year supply, it will be well utilized treasured due to my new remote location.",

A few in your pocket, one in your change purse, the glove box, etc. I tried keeping full size tampons on hand, but the cardboard applicator always ends up getting crushed, and the body of the tampon frays to the point of no longer being usable. I've found these in my pants pockets after they've come through the washer and the tampon was still as good as new.Other reviewers have voiced complaints about these not inserting easily, but I've found just the opposite. Most tampons are loose and fray easily, and I've had trouble inserting those even with an applicator. These are densely packed, and stay smooth all the way in.",
