                "reviewText": "I have extremely heavy periods and the only tampon that has ever worked for me are the Kotex U, which has been discontinued. I've been buying different brands all year, testing and trying them out. I'm also plus sized and I can't use Tampax, et al, because they applicator is so small and has no lip or grip. I can't contort myself into a pretzel to try and inset a tampon. If you're bleeding heavily, the applicator gets wet and makes it almost impossible to push those in or take them out.I tried the Lola brand sold here on Amazon and they were about as close as I could find but were packed so tightly that they didn't absorb much. When you take them out, you basically do a Kill Bill across the bathroom floor with a big glop of blood everywhere, because it's more of a plug than an absorbent tampon. They also hurt because they were packed like bricks. My vag felt like it had a headache all the time, lol.These, however, are about 99% there. Good absorbency and comfortable to insert. They're soft so they absorb the blood. And most importantly, they have the wide-bottomed applicator that has a lip on the edge so you can grip it if things are slippery.My only complaint is that the bottom applicator tends to separate from the top piece. The great thing about Kotek U was that when you inserted the bottom and pushed it through, there was a little dot that clicked them together so when you pulled it out they came out together with no problem. I find I have to dig a little to make sure I'm pulling both pieces out at the same time. But other than that, they are a fantastic replacement.",

                "reviewText": "So, I\u2019ve been searching for a clean brand tampon that is also extremely absorbent. This is not it. I am a heavy bleeding girlie during the first 3 days of my period so I need a tampon that can hold me through at least 2 hours without bleeding through.I\u2019ve always used Tampax ultra. Those are THEE JAM!!! Those ultra\u2019s carried me through 4 hours at at time without a leak.BUT, I can\u2019t use them anymore because I read they are toxic and can cause cancer and all that blah blah so I\u2019m trying so hard to be better to my body and the environment.I\u2019ve bought Lola, I\u2019ve bought organic brand, I\u2019ve bough rael, and now Cora.also, TMI but when um inserting the tampon, i seem ti always get my labia pinched with the applicator. OUCH.So far, cora is the best so far out of that list but I still have to wear a pad together with the tampon at work for obvious reasons. I wish wish wish I can find the winner",

No. Are they at least comparable or better than the other alternatives? Yes. The applicator is trash. BUT, if you figure out how to hold it a certain way it\u2019s not impossible.I have put these tampons through crazy crossfit workouts with zero leaks, and no slippage or any other crazy problems. No bits and pieces coming off while taking the tampon out. Nothing like that.Again. They are not Kotex, they are not better than Kotex. Ladies I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever getting another security tampon. These will definitely do though.",
