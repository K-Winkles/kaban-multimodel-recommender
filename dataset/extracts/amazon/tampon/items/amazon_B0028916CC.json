You only get a handful of Ultras/Supers and like 100 regulars. I don't remember the actual amount but I don't like spending money on products I don't need and super/regulars I don't bother using and I have them coming out my ears. My flow has been extremely heavy recently and these are the only ones worth using. This is probably a review for tampax themselves; however all the pictures are right. My box came opened too. Customer service screwed up and took forever on my refund but they're the only ones who have these. I have no choice. Something really needs to be done about these opened boxes! Why open but not take any??",

Worth every penny to not have the constant worry of bleeding through tampon, pad, underwear and pants.HOWEVER, I RECOMMEND BUYING AT TARGET.

Id sometimes flood a super plus tampax and a pad within an hour or two when its bad. these offer a little more protection so have been a real find for me. I got 2 boxes and keep them in the back of the drawer for the really bad days or overnight. I initially wondered if these was quite big when i first got them, but if i use them only on the heavy flow days its great.",
