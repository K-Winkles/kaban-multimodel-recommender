I have very rough periods, and since I\u2019ve switched from Tampax to these, my cramps are GREATLY reduced. They are MUCH better. They are tolerable now. I am a very busy person and student healthcare worker. I ain\u2019t got time for this shit. Periods have taken so much from my life. These tampons have been a gift and I\u2019m not going back to Tampax ever. Other organic tampons leak, but I have zero problem with these. Would give 6 stars if I could.",

                "reviewText": "I am pretty sure they don't hold the same amount as my tampax, but I've found if I size up (ie when I normally need a Super Tampax, I use Super Plus here) it works well. I've only used them for one cycle so far, but I've found them far more comfortable and the fact that they are organic is worth it to me as I have been getting a lot of irritation from the non-organic products. After caring for someone with cervical cancer, I've been taking this issue way more seriously. The cardboard applicator on the S and S+ sizes are not as easy to use as the plastic on the Reg, but in my opinion its not that big of a deal, just something to get used to. Will continue to use these!",

Absolutely love them, and may live on them as many as I buy. Not sure. To whoever makes these, great work, makes my life much more peaceful, and you can\u2019t put a price on that..",

                "reviewText": "I never write reviews but thought I would share my experience with using Cora tampons. I originally found them at Target but with very limited selection, so I am really happy to know I can get the sizes and options I need, all with prime shipping! I purchased a combo box of super+/super, and honestly after the first Cora tampon I used, I didn't want to use any other brands! I am very sensitive to pretty much everything, and I could tell the difference immediately between Cora and other popular brands that I have used my entire life. After using only Cora for the past several months, I can honestly say my cramping and period pain has decreased, and I think it is due to the fact that there are no chemicals in these tampons and the cotton is organic. I had to use a different brand recently when I found myself out & about without supplies, and I seriously could feel my insides cramping from the toxins. I could always \"feel\" tampons before, but I thought that's just part of being a woman and having your cycle and wearing tampons. Not with Cora. I can't \"feel\" them at all. They are the best natural, chemical and toxin free tampon I have found!! And I have tried literally all of them! Seriously try them, you will not regret it.",
