I originally purchased 4 boxes of 36- half super, half regular-back in May 2017. I gave 1 box to my daughter so 3 boxes have lasted about 4 months. I don't have any of the issues other reviewers have had and that is why I felt compelled to write my review. I have tried numerous organic tampons, even tried the Diva cup-too messy, and these are the first to:1. stay in, they have never fallen out or even slipped a little-this was a huge problem for me with other brands! Maybe this is bc I've had kids?2. when inserting they slip right in & don't get stuck in the applicator so zero have gone to waste, I think this is bc applicator is plastic & organic tampons are usually paper3. I change mine regularly every 2-4 hours except at night, depending on flow and I've never leaked with these, not even in the morning after 8-hour sleep. This has translated into so much more confidence and I'm now using fewer pads/pantiliners which equals less waste and eliminates the icky pad feeling (Houston is hot y'all, the fewer layers the better)4. They are easy to open and don't make a ton of noise. Not a huge deal, but I'm an introvert and sincerely appreciate my tampon bringing more quiet into the world.5. I love that they're not bright orange or hot pink. I carry my tampons freely (I usually tuck my huge pad into my huge bra) but I prefer for my long sparkly nails to be the loudest thing I wear & hate always having to compete with my period accessories so I appreciate that these blend with my outfit as I'm strutting to the bathroom. Honestly, that was the first thing that caught my eye about these.I am looking into signing up for the free trial on the website where they offer a plan to deliver every 3 months, but...1. I need more than the max 24 tampons per month bc I'm buying for 2, almost 3, and that's not gonna cut it!2. I also need pads/pantiliners and will have to purchase separately until, hopefully, Cora is making those too (hint, hint)So, for now, I'll continue to purchase right here.",

Tell me why I received them and they came in plastic packaging and were noticeably bigger. The regular is almost as big as the Super used to be and the Super is wayy bigger. The light ones are close to how they used to be but are def bigger. I don't know if this is like a dupe version and I got scammed or something. They could have changed the way they make them but idk.. They are not impossibly big or anything, I am still going to use them but the size difference is kinda noticeable (coming from someone who doesn't tend to notice these kinds of things).",

                "reviewText": "I used these for my last period, which was my second period postpartum (I've had multiple children, so that makes a difference with fit as well). I was at a convention doing tons of walking.The product itself gets 4 stars: I love having an applicator (I had happily been using ones w/o an applicator for years, but don't like using those in public restrooms), but I had some difficulty getting the tampon to pop all the way out of the applicator--several times I pulled the applicator out with the tampon still stuck in the very end and had to retry. Granted, I'm not used to any kind of applicator, so that might not be an issue with just this product. An open applicator tip might help, but then that might impact the comfort for insertion I guess. I did leak a little, but I always wear a pad or at least a pantiliner with tampons since now that I've had kids and am older they fit differently, so the liner caught the fluid that did make it past the tampon--it was not a significant amount.The company support was fantastic and gets the full 5 stars: I love the company philosophy and their commitment to women worldwide. There was a mistake in my order as filled by Amazon, but the company quickly sent me a replacement and allowed me to keep the product that was sent as well. I was impressed by their concern for their customers.As a side note, I like the packaging. Both halves of the boxes are great for holding things like kids' craft supplies or toiletries, and the bottom half is free of labeling so can be used out on shelves or a desktop.",

                "reviewText": "These tampons used to be the same style as Playtex, which is becoming extremely difficult to find. Tampax style has never worked for me, the expanding wall of cotton not only leaks frequently, it is terrible at absorbing and is painful for me. The Playtex style gently opens like an upside down flower, is more absorbent, and rarely leaks. That is what works for my body and why I was excited when I found Cora (Rael made the same exact switch). I suppose it\u2019s cheaper to make, but for some of us it makes an already unpleasant experience torture.I opened a new box today and was surprised by a leak after 45 minutes. Then I realized why and was not happy because it meant running to the bathroom every 45-60 minutes. The Playtex style lasted a minimum of four hours. I refuse to pay for a product that I\u2019m using four times faster. Cora -you\u2019ve lost a customer, to say I\u2019m disappointed is an understatement.",
