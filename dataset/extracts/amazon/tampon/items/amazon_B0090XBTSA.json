The pure organic cotton absorbent core is hypoallergenic as well as being biodegradable, making a natural tampon for safe wear every day. The pure cotton tampon is bleached without chlorine which reduces the risk of irritations and allergies. The only bleaching process that is carried out by Organyc is for good hygiene. These organic cotton tampons are treated by a naturally occurring disinfectant called hydrogen peroxide which is a safe and natural alternative to chlorine. For an additional hygiene aspect, the cotton tampons are also individually wrapped. The cardboard applicator with a soft rounded tip allows for gentle and comfortable insertion.",

I like that they are organic because who wants chemicals leaching into the body?! I have to use applicator, and this one is easy to use. It slides easily and doesn't get stuck like some brands. I give 4 stars because the actual tampon seems just a little too long. But it absorbs really well, and no leaking!",
