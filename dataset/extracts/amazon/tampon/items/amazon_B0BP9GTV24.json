A plus for me is the mix of light and regular, I don't think the name brands offer a mix. The best part is it's organic and I refuse to go back to the name brands I've been using for decades. The one hiccup is I've noticed the cotton is thicker thus harder to insert at times, and doesn't quite conform to your body so there are little gaps somewhere that allow leaks. Still I prefer to choose my health over stained underwear - just use a panty liner if that happens.",
