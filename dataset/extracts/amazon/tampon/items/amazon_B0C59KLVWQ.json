Also great for the environment, everything about it is biodegradable! And the tampons are very comfortable to put use. Would highly recommend this product!",

Don\u2019t let the plant based applicator scare you away if you\u2019re use to plastic - these feel no different, totally comfortable and perfectly absorbent!",
