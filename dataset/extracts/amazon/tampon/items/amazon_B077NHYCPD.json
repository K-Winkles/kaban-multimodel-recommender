                "media_text": "Find your Flow Combo Your period is different every day of your flow, so why wear the same tampon absorbency? Tampax Radiant tampons come in different absorbencies, so you can move up or down as needed. A lot of women experience a heavier flow in the beginning of their period, and then it gets lighter toward the end. So you might want to think about switching between different absorbencies. If the tampon reaches full absorption before four hours, you need a higher absorbency like Super or Super Plus for extra protection. If there is still white fiber showing after four to eight hours, you need a lower absorbency. Use for a maximum of eight hours. FAQ How do I use a Tampax Radiant Tampon Applicator? Tampax Radiant tampons have a textured grip applicator for easy and comfortable insertion. With the removal string hanging down, insert the outer tube at a slight upward angle, toward the small of your back. Gently slide the applicator all the way in until your fingers touch your body. Then push the inner tube all the way into the outer tube until the ends of both tubes are even. Place the used applicator back into the wrapper and throw it away. How does Tampax Radiant stop leaks? Tampax Radiant has a LeakGuard Braid to help stop leaks before they happen. What makes Tampax Pocket Radiant different from Tampax Radiant? Tampax Pocket Radiant compact tampons offer the same protection as Tampax Radiant tampons, but are more discreet. They're a full-size tampon in a smaller extendable applicator.
