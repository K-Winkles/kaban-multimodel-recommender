Here's why:Comfortable Fit: These pantyliners are incredibly soft and flexible, making them comfortable to wear all day long. They conform to the body's contours without feeling bulky or restrictive.Absorbency: Despite their slim design, these pantyliners offer excellent absorbency.Discreetness: One of the things I appreciate most about these pantyliners is how discreet they are.Adhesive: The adhesive on these pantyliners is strong enough to keep them securely in place without causing any discomfort when removing them.Scent-free: I prefer feminine hygiene products that are scent-free, and these pantyliners deliver on that front. They're free from any artificial fragrances, which is a big plus for me.",

If they come in one of those envelopes there's a pretty high chance it will be damaged. Sometimes it's minor but last time it was so bad I couldn't use them.I still recommend them.",

As the headline states, within hours, the sides of the liner tear away from the main pad which deteriorates its ability to provide any protection. When this occurs, it bunches up and becomes uncomfortable. I had originally searched for Extra Long on the Amazon site and when it brought up various different sizes of boxes, the color of the boxes were all the same, so I chose one that had a good price and quantity. When I received it, I found that they had sent Regular instead. I phoned them and they informed me that I had ordered that size. I told them no, I had searched for Extra Long and had chosen a size on that product page. The agent informed me that the page included all different sizes and the quantity and volume I had selected came only in Regular. I asked her then why did it come up when I requested Extra Long? I assumed as all the boxes were the same color that this was the size searched for. In any case, this is an unusable product and a waste of money. Find another brand that has good customer satisfaction.",
