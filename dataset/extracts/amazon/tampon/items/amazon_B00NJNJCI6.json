I was hesitant at first, worried I'd get some severely inferior product that might cause some rare, news-making infection. I read a few reviews though, and these seemed to be legit so I placed my order. Can confirm, at least when shipped thru Amazon, that these are not knock-offs, they are legit. These are my favorite brand/style because they are so easy-to-use, eco-friendly/create less waste, are discrete and portable, comfortable and they work. I realize I could try change to a different brand or product that is available to me locally, but there's just certain things in life that I'm brand loyal to - this is one of them. I'm grateful to get these thru Amazon, and I'd be so dissapointed if the manufacturer discontinues making these. One could easily put these on a routine shipment to make life easier - I (fortunately) don't go thru them fast enough so don't have to worry about that.",

                "reviewText": "First time buyer and wasn't sure what to expect but overall good experience!Opened the box and was shocked how compact it was... wasn't sure if a single Obi tampon would absorb what I want it to. After fluffing it out, it was as big as Tampax regular tampons.HOW TO REMOVE WRAPPING:Took me a few times to figure out how to efficiently remove the wrapping without touching the clean tampon with my fingers/ hands too much as it will be going into my body...** Check out the photos for a step to step guide!!**PERSONALI am usually a light to medium flow gal, occasional heavy (usually the first day). Irregular flow as sometimes it can be light then medium then light again in the same cycle. Was using Tampax as it was more affordable than other brands I've tried.Decided to try a budget friendly Obi as necessity costs add up.In the recent period cycle, I used a Tampax super for the night as it is usually a larger flow. Then I started using Obi the day after. I change it out after 3.5 to 4 hours and it kept everything together. No leakage. I'm pleasantly pleased and want to continue using Obi on light to medium days.Uncertain how far can one Obi regular really go but it is currently matching the Tampax regulars.CONs1. Hard to remove the plastic wrapping at first but after some practice, I am OK.2. The plastic wrapping. It feels worst from my initial Tampax where they use paper wrappings and paper inserts. I guess the plastic keeps it compact..?3. I am OK with inserting Obi tampons with my fingers. It may be an issue to some people.Although there are cons, it is a pretty good product to use and since I'm replacing Tampax regulars with Obi regulars, I consider this a win.",
