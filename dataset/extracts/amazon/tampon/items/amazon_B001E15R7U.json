I honestly one time while on a road trip forgot I already had one in, I wound up realizing both then had been in for many hours, and because they are wonderful organic products there was no danger or concern of toxic shock or anything! I have tried using \"regular\" tampons with all of the horrible chemicals in them after using natracare, and I can feel the burning and the chemicals practically, so now I just don't do it, and it's why I just bought a big bulk order of Natracare tampons from Amazon to be prepared !!",
