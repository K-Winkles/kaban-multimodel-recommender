                "reviewText": "I've been using these for literally years and I happened to notice the review section the other day, so I just felt the need to throw my support behind this product as it's always been an excellent one for me. I've personally not had issues with leaking unless I wait too long to change one, and I have ridiculously heavy periods. I recently started wearing bamboo period underwear (also from Amazon) with them just for added protection for when I'm unable to stop and get to a restroom, and while they weren't really necessary they really help with peace of mind. I don't think they're difficult to use, nor do they pinch (never had that happen to me at least) - not the plastic ones, anyway. I tried to go down that road with cardboard but I find cardboard applicators impossible and really messy.Before I used these, I used to have UTIs and yeast infections constantly. Someone asked me if I'd ever tried switching to organic tampons, because regular cotton is grown with a lot of pesticides and other stuff that can irritate sensitive vaginal tissue. I made the switch to organic and the difference was night and day. The few times I've had to use a regular tampon since, I could literally feel it burning my skin. I had probably just become so used to the irritation before that I never even noticed it. I've tried several brands of organic tampons but have always come back to these since finding them. They feel and perform, in my opinion, indistinguishably from regular tampons.",
