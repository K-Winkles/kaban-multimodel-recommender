It comes empty so you need to get those yourself. I am not complaining. I am just suggesting for the seller to notify buyers of this detail on the description like\"\"Feminine products not included\" or something to that effect. If you do, I apologize in advance however it's not as accessible as it should be if that is the case. At any rate, cute and useful item.",
