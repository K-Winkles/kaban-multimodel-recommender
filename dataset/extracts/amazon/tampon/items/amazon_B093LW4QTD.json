Tampax Pearl Tampons have a special LeakGuard Braid to help stop leaks before they happen, while a Smooth Removal Layer allows for easy removal. Plus, FormFit Protection gently expands to fit your individual shape. How long can I wear a tampon? You can wear a tampon for up to eight hours, but never leave it in for longer than that. If you usually sleep longer, set an alarm or just use a pad instead. How do I know which absorbency to use? Choosing the right tampon absorbency can make a big difference to be comfortable and avoid leaks. Take the Tampax Quiz on Tampax's website to learn more. What makes Tampax Pearl different from Tampax Pocket Pearl? Both Tampax Pearl and Tampax Pocket Pearl offer outstanding protection with a LeakGuard Braid to help prevent leaks. The main difference is that Tampax Pocket Pearl is compact in size so it fits in your pocket. When ready to use, extend the compact applicator to make it a full-size one.",

                "reviewText": "Sometimes it's just very uncomfortable to put in a regular absorbency tampon when you're only bleeding a small amount. Sometimes I just don't feel like wearing my period underwear or a pad so these are wonderful. Also there are some times when I'm not planning on having a tampon in for a full 6 to 9 hours so throwing in a light tampon is perfect for having to pull it out in 2 or 3 hours and not wanting that uncomfortable feeling like my insides are being pulled out with the tampon.",

                "reviewText": "It was late, so it came on the last day of my period, but it's perfect for those with a lighter period and/or people who pee often. I use a disc overnight then use lights/regulars during the day. Buying in bulk makes the price worth it and they last forever when you use it with cups/discs. I would just use discs, but I feel like when I use it back to back I start getting sore. So this is perfect.",
