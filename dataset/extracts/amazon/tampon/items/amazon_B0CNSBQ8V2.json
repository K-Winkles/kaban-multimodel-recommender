Very convenient to keep one at work and one at home, so I am covered at all times. These were easy to use and comfortable. The applicator was smooth and has a grip to hold onto during insertion. The super strength version kept me going doing the heavy flow times.",

I amGlad i was able to use these organic tampons, which come with a BPA-free applicator for easy insertion. It worked like a charm.2 sets of tampon packs with 16 tampons each. Super absorbency as shown in the description. I don't recommend wearing them at night though.Although, the first time dealing with tampons, i have previously used day/night pads from this brand and liked them too. So I was sure this product was gonna be equally good.Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "The wife says these organic tampons are easy to use and sufficiently absorbent to be useful in everyday situations. Not quite as good as her favorite brand, but still a solid choice. Owing to the organic and hypoallergenic nature of these tampons, they might be a good choice to stock for guests or simply to keep as a backup at work, in the car, or stashed in your outdoor/camping equipment.",

                "reviewText": "These tampons work great. Applicator is smooth and the super absorbency is sufficient. I love that it is made of fragrance free organic material so there are no concerns of toxic chemicals, dyes, or pesticides. I do wish it came with a cardboard applicator variety, but bpa free plastic is certainly easier to use. No complaints as the product works great and the organic material offers peace of mind.",
