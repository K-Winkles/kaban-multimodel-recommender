Tampax Pearl Tampons have a special LeakGuard Braid to help stop leaks before they happen, while a Smooth Removal Layer allows for easy removal. Plus, FormFit Protection gently expands to fit your individual shape. How long can I wear a tampon? You can wear a tampon for up to eight hours, but never leave it in for longer than that. If you usually sleep longer, set an alarm or just use a pad instead. How do I know which absorbency to use? Choosing the right tampon absorbency can make a big difference to be comfortable and avoid leaks. Take the Tampax Quiz on Tampax's website to learn more. What makes Tampax Pearl different from Tampax Pocket Pearl? Both Tampax Pearl and Tampax Pocket Pearl offer outstanding protection with a LeakGuard Braid to help prevent leaks. The main difference is that Tampax Pocket Pearl is compact in size so it fits in your pocket. When ready to use, extend the compact applicator to make it a full-size one.",

I have tried many things but I keep coming back to Tampax pearl. They are the best tampons I have ever used and compared to most other sanity options, they are the easiest. I have tried other brands and they leak, which c'mon, periods are already annoying enough, now I have to worry about embarrassment? These are not cheap, which is super lame, but thankfully amazon has my back! Also, whats worse than going into the super market to buy my monthly tampons/ibuprofen and candy bar than to have the clerk make some sort of PMS joke. No thanks, not today a-hole!",

I still wear backup of course, but I just simply have less issues with these. The price is good since they get delivered, though I did find them cheaper at Costco for those with a membership. I have tried playtex sport and I still leaked. They do have the \"360\" version now that claims to have 3 layers that I haven't tried but you can't buy them in a big pack like this so they end up being more expensive.",

My first few days are often very heavy, and having a few of these handy is the best way for me to stay prepared. If you're *very* heavy on days 1-2, like I am, you may want to opt for the Super Plus absorbent ones (I find myself changing out the Supers every 1-2 hours). But the Pearl line is by far my favorite. Keep in mind these are NOT as discrete as pocket-sized expandable tampons, but they are far more reliable!",

                "reviewText": "These were perfect. I bought this big box hoping to not have to buy another for a long time and I ended up not having to buy any more for almost 2 years. They came in little plastic pouches so they were easy to hide in my purse or pocket. The plastic applicators were also easy to slide in. Sometimes it was hard to push the cotton in depending on your flow, but just wipe your hand off, try again. Overall, if you have a regular flow to a semi heavy flow, these will work fine. When they get too full you can feel them almost trying to come out so that means it's time to change. I'm semi heavy at first then I slow down to regular flow and I'd change mine 3 to 4 times a day. Also, I never had an issue with leaking at night while these were in.People make too much of a big deal of woman in their periods sometimes and menstruation is nothing to be ashamed about. I just wanted to put an honest review of the product.",
