                "reviewText": "I can not say enough about these. I've use Tampax for decades, but I have recently been making the switch to a more organic/natural/cruelty-free lifestyle. I decided to try organyc tampons because they claim to be organic cotton, cruelty free, bleach free, and hypoallergenic. I didn't even know that the burning and discomfort from tampons was abnormal. These are amazing! I can't tell I have a tampon in, there is NO discomfort or irritation at all. I am a fan already and will never buy a box of mass produced, insecticide filled, bleached tampons again.Pros:I literally can not tell they are in.Comfortable.No irritation.No yeast infections.No dyes/fregrances/or harsh chemicals.Cons:I'm glad I read reviews before purchasing, you MUST twist to separate the two parts of the applicator before attempting to insert.Insertion can be difficult, but patience is key here. I've found that practice does indeed make it much easier to insert. Just slightly start to push the tampon out before inserting, it will make it easier for the tampon to exit the applicator once inside. I will absolutely admit I had to waste one the first use because, yes, they were a bit more difficult to insert.Yes. I would absolutely recommend these to any woman looking for an organic cotton tampon.Yes. I will buy more!",

                "reviewText": "I had been purchasing Tampax Pearl, until I went on a natural health product streak when I found out what awful chemicals are in everyday beauty products (not to mention food!). When I realized that cotton was one of the products with the most pesticides, I decided I didn't want pesticides inside my body every month. So I did some research and found these tampons. They are slightly expensive, but they come in a two pack. I usually order a two pack of regular, super and super plus sizes about every 6 months. They have been great and haven't leaked at all! I did like plastic applicators better, but it's a small price to pay. Great product!",

                "reviewText": "I needed a tampon and one fast, 7th gen tampons were out of stock so I figured I would try these(thanks to Prime I got them in two days)...we were heading off to the cabin with my husbands family for a week and would be spending time in and around the lake. The cardboard applicators on these things are HORRIBLE!!! they are flimsy, get stuck (meaning you cannot push them up) and crumple and you cant even \"apply\" the tampon. I am so mad that I bought TWO packs of these tampons. I will never purchase these again! So instead of being prepared I had to run into town and purchase a different brand of non-organic tampons. Dont buy these things ladies, save your money!",

We get enough from everything else including the air. Death from above! An old Command & Conquer reference... Listen to General Solomon and get those SAM sites lock and loaded. This tampon is as good as any SAM site for this matter.",
