TSS is a rare but serious disease that may cause death. Please consult the product insert for further information. WARNING SIGNS OF TSS ARE, FOR EXAMPLE, SUDDEN FEVER (USUALLY 102\u00b0 F OR MORE), VOMITING, DIARRHEA, FAINTING OR NEAR FAINTING WHEN STANDING UP, DIZZINESS, OR A RASH THAT LOOKS LIKE A SUNBURN. IF THESE SIGNS OR OTHER SIGNS OF TSS APPEAR, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE TAMPON AT ONCE, DISCONTINUE USE, AND SEE YOUR DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY. IMPORTANT FACTS ABOUT TSS:There is risk of TSS to all women using tampons during their menstrual period. TSS is a rare but serious disease that may cause death. There are scientific studies that have concluded that tampons contribute to the cause of TSS. The reported risks are higher to women under 30 years of age and teenage girls. The incidence of TSS is estimated to be between 1 and 17 cases of TSS per 100,000 menstruating women and girls per year. REDUCING YOUR RISK OF TSS:You can reduce the risk of developing TSS during your period by alternating tampons with feminine pads. You can avoid any possible risk of getting tampon-associated TSS by not using tampons. There are scientific studies which have concluded that higher absorbency tampons increase the risk of TSS. You should select the minimum absorbency needed to control your flow to reduce the risk of developing TSS. Tampons are available in a range of absorbencies: Regular Absorbency (6-9 grams), Super Absorbency (9-12 grams) and Super Plus Absorbency (12-15 grams). Each absorbency range represents the grams of fluid that can be absorbed by all manufacturers' tampons based on a standardized laboratory test. Use this information to compare the absorbency of these tampons to other brands. If you have had warning signs of TSS in the past, you should check with your doctor before using tampons again. Consult your doctor if you have any questions about tampon use and TSS. See more",

I find them to be very absorbent since they do open up into a sort of umbrella shape. Perfect for those heavy days! Personally, I find they actually work better than other brands. The price is decent too! I recommend them based on my experience and will buy again. But every woman is different, so you don't know until you try. Good luck! 5 stars.",
