                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Tampon Tribe Certified Organic Tampons with Applicator, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase! They truly have exceeded my expectations in every way.The fact that they are certified organic and hypoallergenic is a huge plus for me. I have sensitive skin, and I've had issues with irritation and discomfort in the past with other tampon brands.(also, when I researched, I realized others were not truly organic) \u2026with Tampon Tribe, I've had no such issues! That makes them my best choice.The applicator design is easy to use, comfortable, and ensures that the tampon goes in smoothly without any discomfort! So important!! I've used tampons with flimsy applicators in the past, and it's a world of difference to have a sturdy, reliable one like this.The Tampon Tribe tampons are also super absorbent. I\u2019m confident I\u2019ll be dry with them. I also appreciate that they come in different absorbency options, for my needs of the moment.I noticed some negative reviews here, but I wanted to share my positive experience to offer a more balanced perspective. It's important to remember that everyone's body is different, and what works for one person may not work for another. That said, I believe that these Tampon Tribe tampons are definitely worth trying.For a reliable, organic, and hypoallergenic option, I highly recommend giving these tampons a chance. They\u2019ve given me peace of mind. ** Plus, the environmental benefits of using eco-friendly products are an added bonus. If you\u2019re on the fence, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to give them a go!",

                "reviewText": "Tried these a year ago ... Haven't looked back. Love that the cotton is natural, without dyes or additives. (I don't need my tampons smelling like roses!) They also have FANTASTIC CUSTOMER SERVICE!Like lots of people mention, I had an issue figuring out the applicator. It would \"get stuck\" and I'd have to throw the thing away. But I wrote to them about it and they sent a link to a short video explaining how to rotate the applicator to \"unlock\" it. (Plus they offered to replace the tampons I'd wasted in the process!)The video made all the difference. It's easy once you've done it a few times.I will say that if you are accustomed to plastic applicators, these take a bit of getting used to. Sometimes, I like to \"test\" it by pushing the tampon out just a centimeter to feel that it slides easily, before inserting. That tiny extra moment of mindfulness is worth it to me to eliminate my use of plastic applicators.I love the minimal packaging as well. They really are dedicated to sustainability and eliminating extra or harmful materials.And I appreciate how I can customize not just how many of which absorbency I get in my package, but how often too (like every 2 mos if you don't need new ones *every* month).Also, I get pretty heavy flow the first couple of days, and I use the extra super for that. And they work great. The \"regular\" works kind of like the light tampons from companies like tampax. So keep that in mind. \"Size up,\" so to speak.",
