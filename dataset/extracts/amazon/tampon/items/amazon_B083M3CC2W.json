I have tried the newest Kotex \u201cClick\u201d a couple years ago and they absolutely suck! The mechanism(which is supposed to make them more compact) would constantly UNCLICK while you insert..which then pushed the tampon OUT of the applicator and would basically just fall on the floor! Biggest waste of money! I actually didn\u2019t even realize until now that I paid $36 for 1 box of 32..thought it was at LEAST 2 boxes! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f That was my fault for hastily purchasing \u201cpast items\u201d that are in constant need! Glad I tapped \u201c1 time only purchase\u201d \ud83d\ude21Tampax sucks too!We all need to write to Kotex to bring them back!They were truly the best, most comfortable, and reliable tampons ever \u2639\ufe0f",
