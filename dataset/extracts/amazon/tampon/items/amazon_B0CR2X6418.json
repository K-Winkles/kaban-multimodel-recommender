If you have a lighter menstrual flow, such as at the beginning or end of your period, regular tampons are a suitable choice. They are smaller and less absorbent, making them more comfortable to insert and remove. Super Tampons Super tampons are best suited for days with a moderate to heavy menstrual flow. These tampons have a higher absorbency level, making them ideal for when your flow is at its peak. Using super tampons on your heaviest days helps prevent leaks and allows you to go longer between changes. Super Plus Tampons Super plus tampons are designed for extremely heavy flow days. If you experience heavy flow or have a long-lasting period, super plus tampons can provide the necessary protection. They are the most absorbent and are essential for ensuring you stay comfortable and leak-free during these intense flow days. Available in 3 absorbencies 6-9 grams 9-12 grams 12-15 grams",

I found the tampon itself to be soft and leak proof. The price is a bit on the higher side and they do get shipped to your house so you will never run out.",
