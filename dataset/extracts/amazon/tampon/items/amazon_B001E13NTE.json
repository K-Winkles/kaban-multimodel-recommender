                "reviewText": "I wish I would have known about these when I was younger! I've read about the dangerous side effects of the chemicals used in commercial tampons and always felt uneasy about using them monthly inside my body. Price, convenience, and the false assurance that \"they can't be that bad or they wouldn't sell them to us\"... kept me from making a change. Well, on a whim, I searched on Amazon, found this brand and decided to give it a try based on the positive reviews. And now I'm here to give my own two thumbs way up for Natracare. First thing I noticed was that the applicator worked consistently as it was supposed to, without sticking. Next thing I noticed, to my complete joy, was that these tampons did their job. Leaking was no longer an issue, which amazed me because I figured that was just part of the whole ordeal. Impressive. The string doesn't fray and it's easy to grab ahold of. But the biggest, most profound difference didn't become apparent until I had been using Natracare for a few months. Cramps that used to plague me the first day or two of my cycle practically disappeared. In fact, so did the headaches and general irritability. I'm no scientist, but my guess is that some of the symptoms I'd always assumed were \"normal\" were my body's way of dealing with the toxins, not the period itself. Like I said, not a scientist... but I'll tell you that this is my brand for the duration. Price: well worth it. Function: 5 stars. Convenience: thanks to Amazon, quick & easy. Sold.",
