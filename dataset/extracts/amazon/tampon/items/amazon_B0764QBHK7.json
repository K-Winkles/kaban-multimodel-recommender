                "reviewText": "I found these and I am glad. Before, I thought I deserved an eco badge for using traditional (national leading retailer) brand product with the paper applicator - since it takes way to much effort to find the paper version, with most stores only carrying plastic applicator products these days. But then I realized that there was a significant amount of plastic in the tampon material itself - which is sub-optimal for my septic tank as well.So, finding these organic cotton tampons is great. I appreciate the manufactures for making this product. It is 99% as good as what I was using performance-wise, and much much better eco-wise.",

I've tried plastic applicator tampons and was concerned about how much trash I was accumulating so I switched after only one cycle. The cardboard applicator was easy and comfortable to use and the tampons themselves where quite absorbent. Would recommend to anyone who wants to be more environmentally conscious about their period but still wants the comfort and convenience of applicator tampons.",

This would have been a 5 star review but I do have an issues with the packaging. I ordered the regular and super size, and while the boxes have a different color, the individual tampons have the exact same wrapper. They are not distinguishable once removed from the box. It was really annoying on vacation. I had brought a few regular and super tampons and always had to open the wrapper to see the size of the tampon to find out which it was. It'd be great if they could fix that problem. Besides that though it's a great product and I'll be purchasing them again",
