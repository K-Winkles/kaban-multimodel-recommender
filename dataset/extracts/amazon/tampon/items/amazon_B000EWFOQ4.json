        "description": "Healthier by nature. 100% Cotton. Certified organic. Non-chlorine bleached. Why organic tampons? In 1989, Natracare was developed as a direct response to health and environmental concerns about dioxin pollution by chlorine bleaching, the use of rayon in tampons, and the extensive use of pesticides on conventionally grown cotton. For over 15 years, Natracare has been trusted by women who see the good sense in making a natural choice in tampons, pads, panty liners and feminine wipes for their monthly cycle. It makes sense to choose a tampon that is made from only certified organic cotton to avoid unnecessary exposure to chemical residuals and synthetics. Natracare Organic cotton tampons and chemical free pads are high quality products made from only pure and natural materials that are not chlorine bleached and are free of rayon, plastics and synthetic materials. Made in Germany.",

The applicator is great -- cardboard, but shaped like the plastic applicators (comes to a round ending instead of the cotton sticking out of the tube). The only reason I took off a star is that I feel like its a little less absorbent than the typical store brand stuff that I used to use; granted, it had mixed materials. And it'ls not a huge deal, but I pay a lot of attention to the details. But I'm still glad to have switched to Natracare!",

                "reviewText": "Yes, I bought tamps online...with 3 women in my home, I'd buy a whole years worth to never have to worry about running out of this pretty essential product. After researching this brand and reading about how the expanded shape is superior to the typical store brand, I was a bit disappointed that I did not notice any difference between this brand and the typical store brand I normally purchase. Note, I did not say 'the leading national brand', I said 'store brand'. I'm not so sure their claims are legit, and I'm not sure it's worth it to pay a premium for this product. While buying them online is great, again, I did not notice a difference between this brand and its store brand counterpart.",
