These are so easy to insert and not a downgrade from plastic at all! Highly recommend and would love to see them at more places than Amazon!",

                "reviewText": "You don't really want to read a review of this product, do you? So let's just summarize as:I got this because I wanted an add-on item. It did not disappoint me - it successfully did what tampons are supposed to do. And there's a lot of them so I don't have to worry about running out for a while. Yay.Let me add a shout-out for cardboard applicators, which seem to be getting less and less popular. Cardboard is biodegradable, plastic is not. I don't really perceive a difference between plastic and cardboard \"in action.\" This is not as pretty or colorful as the \"Pearl\" or \"U\" applicators, but does the stylishness of a *tampon applicator* really matter? Would it be too much think twice about choosing the non-biodegradable stylish plastic applicator over the biodegradable perfectly functional (and cheaper) cardboard applicator?",
