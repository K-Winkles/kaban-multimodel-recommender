You can definitely go a couple hours or so without having to change so quickly . I\u2019ve used these while playing volleyball or during any strenuous activity. I\u2019d say this is also a great product for a first time tampon user. A lot of people are starting to switch to menstrual cups but if you\u2019re a tampon user and want to switch up brands and try something new I\u2019d say go for it! You will not be disappointed! If I did have to point out something negative, I hate that tampons always create a lot of garbage. More biodegradable applicator's and packaging would be a winner!",
