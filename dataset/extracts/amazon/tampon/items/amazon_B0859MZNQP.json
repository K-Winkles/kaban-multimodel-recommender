                "reviewText": "The regular ones I\u2019m not too fond of .. very little hold. However the super was a lot better. The one thing I dislike is the applicator itself. The click aspect of it is really hard to do with one hand which is really unusual \u2026 maybe it\u2019s TMI but the applicator has pinched me a handful of times and I have to utilize both hands to get the applicator to \u201cclick\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t rebuy for that reason.",

I love being on auto renew so I don't need to worry about buying them at the store, and I love that they expand width with absorption instead of long...helps so much. great brand!",
