                "reviewText": "Let me first start off by saying this: I have tried many different brands of organic cotton tampons. Off the top of my head, I\u2019d say it\u2019s been around 5 or 6 different brands.Before I ever switched to organic cotton tampons, I did use tampax. That was years ago.A couple of the reviews on here are complaining about the leaks and comparing them to Tampax.Please allow me to address these two reasons people are rating this brand low.I don\u2019t personally see a difference in these tampons than the other organic cotton ones I\u2019ve used. The issues I\u2019ve had with other organic cotton tampons are the same ones (mostly) that I\u2019ve had with these. The biggest? That the super size still needs to be changed very frequently during the first (sometimes second) day of my period. It does leak, it doesn\u2019t absorb much, BUT all the organic tampons that I\u2019ve used (that I can remember) have been that way.Is it because they\u2019re organic? I don\u2019t know. Could it be because they\u2019re just cotton and do not have all sorts of other harmful materials in them? Possibly.Which brings me to my next point. Stop comparing organic cotton tampons to the terrible-filled-with-synthetic-and-who-knows-what-else-fibers tampon brand. I mean, really. That\u2019s dumb. Either decide you\u2019re going to make the switch because you want something better for your body, or be quiet and stay with your artificial tampon so you can go 6 hours without changing it.I rated these a five because i freaking love the light absorbency tampons they have. For me, those are perfect near the end of my cycle, when I don\u2019t need a regular tampon, but still need something. I\u2019d usually just wear a panty liner, but I prefer tampons.I am going to try the super plus next time to see if it adsorbs better.Either way, I\u2019ll never go back to synthetic fiber-filled tampons.",

I learned to squeeze the applicator when using it to make sure that the cotton portion is deployed correctly. I have had no issues with leaks.",

                "reviewText": "I used to wear regular tampons before I realized how much unnecessary BS & chemicals are in them, so I decided to switch to organic. I\u2019ve tried several different brands, and so far Cora seems to be the best on the market in terms of organic tampons.Although, they are still not that great. There is pretty much zero leak protection. If I\u2019m going to wear these I have to wear a panty liner with it because they leak that much. At that point I might as well wear a pad. I thought maybe I was leaving them in for too long (I normally have them in for 4 hours at a time) so I started wearing them for less I went to 2 hours before changing.. still leaking.. an hour.. still leaking. I by no means have a heavy flow period, but I have to wear the heaviest flow tampon and it still leaks! What\u2019s the point of wearing a tampon if it\u2019s going to leak so much? I\u2019m going through way more tampons in a day then I should be. Also, the ratio for light, regular and heavy tampons is super off. Why so many light? What\u2019s the point in even using light if the heavy flow can\u2019t handle a normal period? These tampons don\u2019t absorb anything!Aside from the poor absorption/leaking issue.. the applicator is awful and the string is far too long. Although, this issue is minor compared to the last and I can deal with this.I can say that these tampons are comfortable to wear and my cramps aren\u2019t nearly as bad as compared to when I\u2019m wearing a non-organic tampon.But.. the leaking. I can\u2019t handle the leaking. If the tampon can\u2019t absorb more then a dime of liquid and there is constant leaking.. it completely defeats the purpose of even wearing a tampon in the first place. And like I said, I don\u2019t have a heavy flow period by any means. I\u2019d say my flow is light-moderate. But I still have to wear the heavy tampons and they still leak, and I\u2019m still constantly changing them.Can we like.. please get an organic tampon that actually absorbs anything and doesn\u2019t leak?",
