                "reviewText": "Every woman should know about organic tampons! Conventional tampon brands like Tampax or Kotex (same company!) are made with GMO cotton which is sprayed with birth-defect and cancer causing chemicals made by Monsanto. No woman wants to put that in her body. Major brand tampons are then chemically treated and bleached. Cotton is absorbent, which is why we use it for this purpose. Cotton will absorb all of those horrible chemicals and then they will leach into your soft woman tissues. Make the switch! It's not more expensive to use organic cotton tampons! I have heard from multiple women who have switched that their cramps were way less intense. Natracare brand also makes tampons with an applicator for those who prefer it. Smart packaging and friendlier for the Earth with less plastic.",

The products arrived very well packaged, as advertised, and on the day they said they would.As for the tampons themselves, Natracare is my new go-to brand for pads and tampons because they \"use certified organic 100% cotton and sustainably-sourced natural, plant based materials\" and they do the job. My only caution to a first time user of this brand would be that the tampons absorb less than you might think. However, since one should change their tampons often anyway, it is actually for the best. The pads on the other hand, I find the regular ones way more absorbent than they should be based on their appearance.",
