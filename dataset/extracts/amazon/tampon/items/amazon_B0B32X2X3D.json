Applicator is comfortable to use (which is honestly one of the MOST important details, am I right?) and functions correctly. Material absorbs decently. It's nice to get this quantity conveniently delivered on the regular so I don't worry about running out, and I'm sure it would be helpful to any embarrassed by shopping for these in person too. My only complaint is on one of my shipments once, every tampon wrapper was sealed shut and would not open at the flap as they should, so weird. That entire group of boxes I had to tear down the side of eCh tampin wrapper instead. But usually they open very conveniently so I'm not holding one shipment against them more than one star off. I'm still happy with the product",
