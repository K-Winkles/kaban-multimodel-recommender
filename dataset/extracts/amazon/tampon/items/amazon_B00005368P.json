I would always end my cycle with irritation, itching and a yeast infection kind of feeling. After reading about the causes for this, I learned that other tampons contain chemicals and dyes to bleach the cotton. Also, the cotton causes micrortears in the vaginal wall, leading to the irritation. As if having a monthly period isn't bad enough, throw in the discomfort of a yeast infection and it's double trouble! Since using the organic cotton tampons, I haven't experienced the usual irritation at the end of a few days using tampons!",

                "reviewText": "I really trust these. Natracare tampons are manufactured in Europe under strict guidlines in a sterile environment. They are organic cotton with no rayon, and are bleached with hydrogen peroxide instead of chlorine. They are available with applicators and without- in the case of those with applicators, they are cardboard. (I will say Natracare has changed the applicator in the past couple of years, and I'm not totally wild about the new design- sort of an \"asterisk\" shape at the opening of the cardboard applicator which the tampon must pass through- which I find rather unnecessary) But I still think that these are the best tampons out there. Safe, naturally bleached organic cotton. No scents, no rayon, no plastic applicators, no dioxins, no junk. Simple. Great. I give these as many stars as I can, and then some. Absolutely worth every penny.",

When I woke up and went to take it out the string was gone. No problem usually they still pop right out on the toilet. Except this one wasn\u2019t. I tried for two hours with a mirror to get it out and I couldn\u2019t. Panic set in and I decided to go to the ER. At the ER they did an exam and told me the tampon had halfway dissolved by my cervix. They had to flush me out and give me a round of antibiotics to prevent an infection. I only had this tampon in a few hours prior to this happening. The hospital said I did nothing wrong and couldn\u2019t have prevented this. Just be careful. I don\u2019t know if I got a bad batch or what. I will never risk it again though.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to try a more natural tampon product than the products offered in the supermarkets which are often bleached and harmful to ph levels. I found this brand and am so glad I did- the product is great, it\u2019s soft and comfortable to wear, just as good as others with the added benefit of being better for the environment. Will definitely continue to buy these and recommend.",
