Tampax Radiant tampons come in different absorbencies, so you can move up or down as needed. A lot of women experience a heavier flow in the beginning of their period, and then it gets lighter toward the end. So you might want to think about switching between different absorbencies. If the tampon reaches full absorption before four hours, you need a higher absorbency like Super or Super Plus for extra protection. If there is still white fiber showing after four to eight hours, you need a lower absorbency. Use for a maximum of eight hours. FAQ How do I use a Tampax Radiant Tampon Applicator? Tampax Radiant tampons have a textured grip applicator for easy and comfortable insertion. With the removal string hanging down, insert the outer tube at a slight upward angle, toward the small of your back. Gently slide the applicator all the way in until your fingers touch your body. Then push the inner tube all the way into the outer tube until the ends of both tubes are even. Place the used applicator back into the wrapper and throw it away. How does Tampax Radiant stop leaks? Tampax Radiant has a LeakGuard Braid to help stop leaks before they happen. What makes Tampax Pocket Radiant different from Tampax Radiant? Tampax Pocket Radiant compact tampons offer the same protection as Tampax Radiant tampons, but are more discreet. They're a full-size tampon in a smaller extendable applicator.

So, don't feel dumb if you weren't sure what to do either. I didn't know they were even pocket size but I did notice the box was smaller. I actually prefer these over the regular size now. And the size comes with Regular and Super sizes. They easily fit in your pocket which is nice, too. I highly recommend these. And the applicator in plastic, NOT cardboard. Please view my picture for what they look like and how they operate. Thank you! Definitely \ud83c\udf1f 5 Stars \ud83c\udf1f",

These do a great job for intended use and prevent leakage. I am just so disappointed that, by now, not all applicators are biodegradable. If I had realized that these were not prior to purchasing, I wouldn\u2019t have. There is no good reason to fill our landfills with more plastic. Everyone else is taking care of that for us! So, if you\u2019re not worried about Mother Earth, this is an excellent option. Personally, I will be searching for a product just like this with a much better applicator.",
