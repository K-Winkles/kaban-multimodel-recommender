                "reviewText": "I recently tried the Playtex Sport Tampons Multipack, and I must say, they exceeded my expectations. The variety pack of regular and super absorbency tampons provided me with the perfect options to cater to my changing needs throughout my menstrual cycle. The tampons are comfortable to wear and have a smooth applicator that makes insertion easy. I appreciate that they are fragrance-free, as it reduces the risk of irritation. These tampons offer excellent leak protection, allowing me to stay active and confident all day long. Overall, the Playtex Sport Tampons Multipack is a reliable and convenient choice for active women seeking comfort and protection during their periods.",

Actually the only brand that I\u2019ve found comfortable sliding in. Most feel hard or scratchy. And they\u2019re so comfortable once inside that it\u2019s easy to forget that you\u2019re even wearing a tampon! I\u2019ve used these my entire life and don\u2019t plan on ever switching!",
