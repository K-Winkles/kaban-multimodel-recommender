I kind of stumbled upon these when I couldn't find what I was looking for as a repurchase. I saw that there was a decent quantity for what appeared to be a great price, especially for being organic. Admittedly, I was a bit surprised at how small the boxes were! Then I realized I had purchased a boat load of non-applicator tampons and thought \"UGH!\" Turned out to be the best mistake I have ever made. After reading the reviews left by others, I made sure I tugged on the string and sort of fanned it out before using. I typically need to use a pad or liner with a tampon the first couple days of my period, as I always end up leaking. I was literally shocked that I have not experienced ANY leaking with these at all. When I went to reorder I had a hard time finding them, everything was saying \"Not in stock, not sure when or IF they will be available\" and I wanted to cry! Luckily I found them and ordered a bunch. I don't know what I'll do if I can't find them at some point...",

                "reviewText": "I will say that there seemed to be a reduction in cramps using these however if you use ultra for heavy days and are changing every 2 hours and using an overnight pad for leak protection in combination, these will not work for those days.It's a wonderful product but if you're middle aged and you've got Freddy Krueger in your uterus, these are for your lighter days. (Buy it but keep ultra on hand...)",
