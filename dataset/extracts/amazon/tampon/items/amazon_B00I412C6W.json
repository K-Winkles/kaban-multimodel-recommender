They're pretty comfortable, and as mentioned, don't leak on me. I wish the cardboard applicator was a tad bit sturdier, and it would be great if the paper wrapper were a little larger so that you could place the used applicator in the wrapper with greater ease. My most favorite tampons are the Tampax Radiant, but these are more economical, so I switch back and forth.",
