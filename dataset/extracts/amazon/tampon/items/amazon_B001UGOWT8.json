TSS is a rare but serious disease that may cause death. Please consult the product insert for further information. WARNING SIGNS OF TSS ARE, FOR EXAMPLE, SUDDEN FEVER (USUALLY 102\u00b0 F OR MORE), VOMITING, DIARRHEA, FAINTING OR NEAR FAINTING WHEN STANDING UP, DIZZINESS, OR A RASH THAT LOOKS LIKE A SUNBURN. IF THESE SIGNS OR OTHER SIGNS OF TSS APPEAR, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE TAMPON AT ONCE, DISCONTINUE USE, AND SEE YOUR DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY. IMPORTANT FACTS ABOUT TSS:There is risk of TSS to all women using tampons during their menstrual period. TSS is a rare but serious disease that may cause death. There are scientific studies that have concluded that tampons contribute to the cause of TSS. The reported risks are higher to women under 30 years of age and teenage girls. The incidence of TSS is estimated to be between 1 and 17 cases of TSS per 100,000 menstruating women and girls per year. REDUCING YOUR RISK OF TSS:You can reduce the risk of developing TSS during your period by alternating tampons with feminine pads. You can avoid any possible risk of getting tampon-associated TSS by not using tampons. There are scientific studies which have concluded that higher absorbency tampons increase the risk of TSS. You should select the minimum absorbency needed to control your flow to reduce the risk of developing TSS. Tampons are available in a range of absorbencies: Regular Absorbency (6-9 grams), Super Absorbency (9-12 grams) and Super Plus Absorbency (12-15 grams). Each absorbency range represents the grams of fluid that can be absorbed by all manufacturers' tampons based on a standardized laboratory test. Use this information to compare the absorbency of these tampons to other brands. If you have had warning signs of TSS in the past, you should check with your doctor before using tampons again. Consult your doctor if you have any questions about tampon use and TSS. See more",

Most come with a combination of regular and super. The larger size tampons hurt me, so the only size I use is regular. This is the first time I've been able to find a box where all the tampons are regular, and therefore usable to me. These are comfortable and absorb well. Probably not good for women who have really heavy periods, but for women who have lighter ones, or want something comfortable to wear on their lighter days, I'd recommend these.",
