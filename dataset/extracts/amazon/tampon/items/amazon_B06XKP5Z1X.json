I also love their cup for when I\u2019m at home, I\u2019ve definitely noticed with the all cotton and natural tampons my cramping is incredibly better and flow is much more consistent and lighter. My period has also gone from almost 6 days to just 4, could not recommend this more.",

But now I can feel safe and secure using a healthy products, and that I am being a responsible consumer because my purchase helps women around the world. The idea of having to miss so much school that you drop out because of your period is daunting, and I think we all take for granted basic necessities that have allowed us to progress as women. I love the sophisticated, simple design of the box and the black packaging, I actually like to have the box displayed in my bathroom. They\u2019re tampons for women... mature... conscious .. thoughtful women!",
