TSS is a rare but serious disease that may cause death. Please consult the product insert for further information. WARNING SIGNS OF TSS ARE, FOR EXAMPLE, SUDDEN FEVER (USUALLY 102\u00b0 F OR MORE), VOMITING, DIARRHEA, FAINTING OR NEAR FAINTING WHEN STANDING UP, DIZZINESS, OR A RASH THAT LOOKS LIKE A SUNBURN. IF THESE SIGNS OR OTHER SIGNS OF TSS APPEAR, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE TAMPON AT ONCE, DISCONTINUE USE, AND SEE YOUR DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY. IMPORTANT FACTS ABOUT TSS:There is risk of TSS to all women using tampons during their menstrual period. TSS is a rare but serious disease that may cause death. There are scientific studies that have concluded that tampons contribute to the cause of TSS. The reported risks are higher to women under 30 years of age and teenage girls. The incidence of TSS is estimated to be between 1 and 17 cases of TSS per 100,000 menstruating women and girls per year. REDUCING YOUR RISK OF TSS:You can reduce the risk of developing TSS during your period by alternating tampons with feminine pads. You can avoid any possible risk of getting tampon-associated TSS by not using tampons. There are scientific studies which have concluded that higher absorbency tampons increase the risk of TSS. You should select the minimum absorbency needed to control your flow to reduce the risk of developing TSS. Tampons are available in a range of absorbencies: Regular Absorbency (6-9 grams), Super Absorbency (9-12 grams) and Super Plus Absorbency (12-15 grams). Each absorbency range represents the grams of fluid that can be absorbed by all manufacturers' tampons based on a standardized laboratory test. Use this information to compare the absorbency of these tampons to other brands. If you have had warning signs of TSS in the past, you should check with your doctor before using tampons again. Consult your doctor if you have any questions about tampon use and TSS. See more",

This, combined with free shipping to my front door, is enough for me! I'm not going to go much into the actual product.... If you're a female of menstruating capacity, you just know what you like. But in case you haven't tried these, know they work well. The combination box accommodates various phases of the cycle and the overall design makes them easy to use. My one concern is that applicator, which is made of plastic, is not biodegradable. Hopefully they get recycled someone along the process.",

Just keep in mind that if you are ordering this on subsc & save, to WATCH OUT! Amzon is known to creep up the prices over time--once you are lulled into complacency from the convenience of it all--but did you know that you might get charged a price that is substantially higher than what it shows you on your subscriptions page? I happened upon this practice when I noticed that there was approximately a 25-33% premium being charged on some items in my S&S order. This was different from the price that Amzon said I was being charged when I was reviewing my order. It only showed the true price on the back-end. I could attach the screen shots, but due to the personal nature of the products, I'm electing not to. :) So, be very careful with your orders. Customer service basically replied saying they don't do post-purchase adjustments. They were not interested in fixing this issue for the consumer.",

One time I was getting my wisdom teeth pulled out and had to go under anesthesia because my wisdom teeth hadn't come out all the way so they were surgically removed. When I woke up, I had these two strings coming out of my mouth. I said to the nurses, \"Who put these tampons in my mouth?\" They laughed.Anyway, I'm not sure if these were the same tampons they used, but if they were it worked great to stop the bleeding of my gums from getting my wisdom teeth taken out. If they're good enough for that, they should be good enough for menstrual bleeding in the va-jay-jay.",

I get a box every month which has worked out perfectly because I always have at least two boxes worth at any given time. Not only that, but these are just the easiest, most comfortable tampons out there. My only complaint is that it's hard to find the scented kind.

                "reviewText": "I love the playtex sport line, the applicator is great having a plug kind of shape places the tampon in perfect position for maximum comfort and protection. Excellent for young new users as well as older girls like myself. They don't leak even after long walks. Nice to have two sizes for heavy days and nights and lighter days in one box. The sport line is the best tampon out there, especially for us active gals.",

                "reviewText": "I've tried just about every brand out there and I find a lot of them are uncomfortable because of the way the expand or because they feel too long after wearing them for a while. I haven't had a problem with these yet! The applicator is comfortable and the packaging is easy to open and dispose of and I rarely if I'm using the correct size. Sometimes I just use what I have available... I would definitely recommend for petite women.",
