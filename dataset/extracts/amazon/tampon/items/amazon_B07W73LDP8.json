I really like these, not sure why there would be a difference but I noticed on another brand I got from Whole Foods I have leaked a couple times and sorry to be graphic but when removing the tampon it actually wasn\u2019t fully absorbed with blood, just one line of the tampon had blood and it seemed to leak. These tampons absorb evenly and fully with blood so premature leaking.THANK YOU Amazon/my box shop for now supplying applicator free tampons. There was only the applicator version of these for a while and I prefer non applicator to be more sustainable.Sorry to preach but I highly encourage women to switch to non applicator or give it a try. I really think once you get used to it it\u2019s very convenient. Also more compact, I keep them in my little wallet pouch..",

However, I have given these a try and \u201cregular\u201d with MySoapBox organic has been wonderful so far. No issues like I normally would and I can actually go about my day without that feeling of anything in place and very comfortable. Hold well, discreet packing, and organic!! Great product.",

My one and only complaint is that the girl in the stall next to me has to assume I\u2019m eating a snickers bar when I open it. The wrapper is pretty crinkly. Small price to pay for your health but I really hope this can be fixed. I will continue to purchase them anyway but discretion is something I value too.",

I was pleasantly surprised. They are just as good as the pads and a great alternative to the garbage in drug stores.",

                "reviewText": "Worst tampons I\u2019ve ever used! I hate to be negative but I\u2019m just wanting to warn y\u2019all, from the applicator to absorbency, I never knew a tampon could be so bad! This product does not absorb much compared to other brands of organic tampons I have used. I constantly dealt with leaking with these and was very nervous about what clothes I would wear with them. Probably my least favorite aspect of this product was the applicator. It's a terrible pain in the butt! More often than not It did not work properly and It was almost ALWAYS an awkward two-handed Jimmy rig to get the thing in! I have been pretty neutral towards tampons my whole life I have even used UB and not been bothered but I literally could not wait to get new ones the very sight of them bother me and I cannot believe this product was approved for sale! Anywho I would recommend L. organic tampons (I know you can get them at target) I could not wait to get back to them, they are more affordable and overall a much better product!",

                "reviewText": "I bought these based on all the 5 star reviews. I\u2019m trying to be more aware of what goes on and in my body, so I got these tampons to try because they\u2019re organic cotton. They\u2019re very comfortable and can\u2019t even tell they\u2019re there, I like that a lot, especially since I\u2019m on the move a lot and work with horses. They do absorb pretty well, obviously still wear a liner(I used the same brand liner- love them!) My biggest issue is the applicator, it is awful! It\u2019s very flimsy and hard to push so usually it takes 2 hands and that\u2019s awkward. I\u2019ve had a few that won\u2019t even push out all the way and come back out with the applicator, that\u2019s a waste! These aren\u2019t cheap.. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll buy them again or not. I may experiment with a few other brands first. 3 stars for the tampon itself.",
