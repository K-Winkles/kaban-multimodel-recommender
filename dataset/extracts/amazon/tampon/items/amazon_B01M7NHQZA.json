Veeda Non-Applicator Tampons are made with ultra-absorbent all-natural 100% cotton for reliable, leak-proof protection. Designed with specialized grooves for added absorption and all-natural cotton string for easy removal. Available in: Lite, Regular, Super & Super Plus with Compact BPA-Free Applicator or Applicator Free Synthetic and/or scented period care products can irritate the sensitive skin of the vulva. Veeda tampons are natural, hypoallergenic and dermatologically tested, which is very important for health. In fact, statistics show that yeast infections are less likely to occur with natural products that contain no chemicals and fragrances. Our 100% natural cotton is sourced directly from a global network of leading cotton traders and all cotton is cleansed with an oxygen cleansing process, not chlorine-bleached, for a healthier eco-friendlier product. This process removes all dirt and impurities including any synthetic matter and this is the exact same process by which all organic cotton is cleansed with, to ensure it also has no synthetic substances. This ensures that the final tampons are truly 100% natural cotton. Veeda tampons are lab-tested for over 250 harmful chemicals and contain no wood or synthetic fibres, no additives, no harsh chemicals and no dioxins. Another advantage to using 100% pure, hypoallergenic cotton, is that cotton does not contribute to the growth of the bacteria that causes Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), irritation and allergic reactions. BETTER FOR YOU, BETTER FOR THE PLANET - Veeda tampons are made with naturally soft, absorbent 100% pure GMO-Free cotton (that\u2019s it, nothing else!) ensuring that your body only meets with the purest, irritation free ingredients. Since 100% pure cotton is made by nature, it biodegrades by nature and won\u2019t build up in landfill.",

Yet, somehow, there is extremely low awareness among women of what ingredients are used in their sanitary protection products and what implications they may have for their health. We believe that natural products are better for you and for our planet. We also believe that when it comes to products that touch the skin, particularly in the most intimate parts of the body, it\u2019s important to know exactly where it came from and how it got there. This is why we are committed to ensuring that all of our products contain ONLY pure, hypoallergenic, 100% natural cotton with No Nasty Chemicals and No Dyes. Unlike other brands, our cotton is grown naturally, not manufactured or altered. Plus, all our products are gently cleansed with oxygen and are chlorine-free. Conventional period care products from well-known brands can be made from blends of bleached cotton and/or synthetic products. They can also contain dioxins from the bleaching process, herbicide residues, synthetic chemicals, artificial fragrances, and dyes. We want to make sure that our products are kinder to the earth in every way possible. After learning how conventionally made feminine care products affected our body and environment, Veeda was created. The average woman uses 11,000 feminine care products in her lifetime; this fact alone keeps us inspired to create a top of line sustainable process when manufacturing our products. Veeda products are made with pure, hypoallergenic, 100% natural cotton. Our cotton is grown naturally, not manufactured or altered. Both our tampons and pads are gently cleansed with oxygen and are chlorine-free. Veeda tampons are made only with 100% Natural Cotton and have No Nasty Chemicals, No Synthetics, and No Dyes. Knowing the facts, consider making a better choice by making Veeda your go-to natural period care brand.",

                "reviewText": "OK product. They are small and nearly same size as O.B. but that's where similarity ends. They pull apart easily when opening them so you have cotton fluff just hanging out. They have not leaked for me but I feel like they need to be changed more frequently then O.B ever did. Opening the dang thing is where you learn if you are a patient person or not. So hard to fine the start spot to open them.I would buy again only because of price and minor inconvenience of cotton fluff doesn't really deter me from use.",
