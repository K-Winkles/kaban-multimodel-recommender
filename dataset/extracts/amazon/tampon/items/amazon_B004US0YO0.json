TSS is a rare but serious disease that may cause death. Please consult the product insert for further information. WARNING SIGNS OF TSS ARE, FOR EXAMPLE, SUDDEN FEVER (USUALLY 102\u00b0 F OR MORE), VOMITING, DIARRHEA, FAINTING OR NEAR FAINTING WHEN STANDING UP, DIZZINESS, OR A RASH THAT LOOKS LIKE A SUNBURN. IF THESE SIGNS OR OTHER SIGNS OF TSS APPEAR, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE TAMPON AT ONCE, DISCONTINUE USE, AND SEE YOUR DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY. IMPORTANT FACTS ABOUT TSS:There is risk of TSS to all women using tampons during their menstrual period. TSS is a rare but serious disease that may cause death. There are scientific studies that have concluded that tampons contribute to the cause of TSS. The reported risks are higher to women under 30 years of age and teenage girls. The incidence of TSS is estimated to be between 1 and 17 cases of TSS per 100,000 menstruating women and girls per year. REDUCING YOUR RISK OF TSS:You can reduce the risk of developing TSS during your period by alternating tampons with feminine pads. You can avoid any possible risk of getting tampon-associated TSS by not using tampons. There are scientific studies which have concluded that higher absorbency tampons increase the risk of TSS. You should select the minimum absorbency needed to control your flow to reduce the risk of developing TSS. Tampons are available in a range of absorbencies: Regular Absorbency (6-9 grams), Super Absorbency (9-12 grams) and Super Plus Absorbency (12-15 grams). Each absorbency range represents the grams of fluid that can be absorbed by all manufacturers' tampons based on a standardized laboratory test. Use this information to compare the absorbency of these tampons to other brands. If you have had warning signs of TSS in the past, you should check with your doctor before using tampons again. Consult your doctor if you have any questions about tampon use and TSS. See more",

However, on the occasions I have shown up at the house after a trip to the drug store without this particular brand, I was... well... in the doghouse. Apparently they work great as intended. Guys, be awesome and get extra so she never runs out. Also, add to your subscribe & save to prevent the same problem AND keep you from doing the drug store shuffle with this beautiful bright pink box.For those of you who camp or do outdoors stuff, there are a ton of other uses for tampons, including water filtration and tinder for fire starting. So if not for her, get some of these for you and learn how to use them outside their designed purpose. Stick to unscented if you intend to suck water through one. :)",

But now the head becomes more round and I don't know why at least 1/3 of them look like the picture - the cotton is out of the tube before you even unpacked it, they are broken!!! Disappointed. Hope the brand will do something to improve it!",
