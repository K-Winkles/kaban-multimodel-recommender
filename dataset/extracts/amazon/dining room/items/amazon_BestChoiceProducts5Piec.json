While it is not flashy, it doesn\u2019t look too cheap either. Once apartment living comes to a finish, she can either use it in an office, a spare room, or we won\u2019t feel bad about donating the set to another small house/ apartment dweller. We\u2019re confident that the set will have quite a few years of life of the table top is cared for.Also, it is worth noting that we (2 ppl) carried the box up to the 3rd floor and it fit in the back seat of the car!! If you are looking for something decent, solid with a small footprint and minimal investment, I recommend this set in gray.",

                "reviewText": "First of all I ordered this table jus as a extension table for thanksgiving and some extra chairs. The table and chair are not easy to put together and the instructions are confusing at times not instructing you on what part of the chair to assemble first. The bolt/screw holes were also unevenly drilled so all the chair bases and the table base was uneven to the metal counter parts so we were forced to screw it in which made the table legs and chair legs slightly uneven. It took me about 4 hours to get everything put together and when making the last chair I noticed there was a missing number #1 screw/bolt no I did not mis place it I only took them out of the bag individually as I was tightening them in so making the 4th chair is impossible . I also noticed before flipping the table we were missing the base of the bottom one of the legs to the table that is circular that fit in with all the other legs. Also most of the number #1 screws bolts wouldn't fit in the table frame to connect the legs to the table the #2s fit finely except for one and that also was tough because of how uneven the frame bolt/screw holes was compared to the actual tables screws/bolt holes. I will be requesting a partial refund due to these flaws as it will be way to much work for me to actually disassemble everything. And this table and chairs deserve to be priced a lot lower or removed from the Amazon market place as it's quality is poor and does not even meet low standards. (****** Edit I contacted the seller and they offered me a full refund I am now to believe that this does not happen with every table I updated feedback because seller immediately responded to my concerns a plus seller",

                "reviewText": "As you can see from the pictures, the product arrived damaged, revealing the vinyl coating they talk about to be rather flimsy and thin. Package looked to have been dropped in the middle, so probably not the company fault, but the table top was not surrounded in styrofoam like the rest. It was in a box of it's own with no padding, so made contact with whatever the box fell on.I will say I have not attempted a return. It is mostly cosmetic so not a big deal. Mostly though, I'm not trying because it took nearly a month to get here, with delay after delay. Pandemic probably had something to do with it. But still.As for the set itself, my daughter and I only just put it together today, so I have no info on wear. I do like the metal feet and construction. It feels sturdy. The tabletop has the feel of one of those plastic folding tables you can get from any department store, though I know it's not because I can literally see the MDF board thanks to the damage.Honestly, I don't think it's worth $165. The metal in the legs and the chairs makes it worth something, but not $165.Overall:Pros: Easy assembly, lightweightCons: Cost, damage due to lack of edge styrofoam on the tabletop,I can't give you a yay or nay. I can only give you my experience. Do with it what you will.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely LOVE this dining table set. My husband and I recently moved to a new apartment and we never had room for a dining table before so we were really excited to get something! The dining space we had room for was on the smaller side so we looked for a smaller table yet was also big enough to host friends and family with room to eat and play games, yet also seat multiple people. This table was perfect. It came in the grey color I needed to match my apartment, it\u2019s skinny and sleek and small for an apartment but not too small and has plenty of room to seat people and space on the table. It\u2019s extremely strong and sturdy and the chairs are perfectly set and sturdy as well. It looks modern and sleek and was fantastic quality for the price. One of my favorite purchases from Amazon to date!",

                "reviewText": "My husband and I just moved into our first house 1,650 miles away from where we were living before, and we had to sacrifice a lot of furniture for the move. I picked this table because of its appearance - although we didn't have a small space there were only two of us so it works perfectly! Really easy to assemble - even alone. The seats may be a little small if you're bigger (I'm 5' 4\" and a little under 200 pounds) and probably wouldn't be comfortable for hours of sitting, but they're pretty sturdy. If you have issues with the chairs wobbling, all you have to do is loosen all the chair screws, press down on the seat (or put something pretty heavy on it) so that it doesn't wobble, and keep holding until you re-tighten all the screws. That way, they all tighten at the correct angles to have every foot on the floor. They do come with little built-in plastic floor protectors, but they are a little slidey on hardwood floors - easily fixed with some furniture felt stickers! I've had other tables in a similar price range and this is definitely the least wobbly if you assemble it correctly. (:",
