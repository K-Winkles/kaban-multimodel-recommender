I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt, but after taking it out of the box I realized that a lot of the screws were missing. The instructions gave info to get parts that were missing.Contacted the manufacturer for possible replacement parts, no response. Contacted Amazon and they advised me that I only had the option to return it. Had to try and repackage in an already damaged packaging and return the entire set! Worst experience with Amazon by far!",
