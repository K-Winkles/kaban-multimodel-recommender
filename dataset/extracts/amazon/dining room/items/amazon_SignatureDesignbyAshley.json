The case is about 150 pounds and contains all the items.The chairs, bench, and table each have their own hardware kit, so it makes organizing this simple. The table took 10 minutes to assemble, 10 minutes per chair, and the bench took 5 minutes. I did not use the provided allen wrench.Tip- if you have a drill or impact gun, go to Harbor Freight or any other cheap tool retailer and buy a bit kit for $10. I used the bit from this kit to assemble everything.The finish amd quality of the set is as expected. No damage during shipping. Stable when fully assembled. The set looks great!",

                "reviewText": "First and foremost the table is nice . Delivery took about a week. Small scratch on the surface of the table which I didn\u2019t even think it was worth a picture . Delivery process is out of the control of Signature Design By Ashley , but total responsibility of the mail carrier . It is a very heavy box which is good because the table has some weight into it , Feels very sturdy and can sit 5-6 people . I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth the price , I don\u2019t know how long it will last , but I do hope at least a year and I\u2019d say I get my moneys worth . Last thing would be to be patient while putting the legs together as you\u2019re going to put 16 legs together and 5 cushions . Instructions are clear and simple to understand took me about an Hour and 30 minutes. ** quick tip - if you have an uneven chair remove the cushion and attempt to sit it flush and tighten back again. I thought they gave me uneven legs on one of them but it was my mistake when building I did not make sure it was leveled and sitting flush .*** Other than that for an affordable table designed by Ashley furniture it\u2019s great 10/10!! I hope my review helps others and if you were to purchase one and have scratched or missing parts remember it\u2019s out of the control of Ashley as this set ships out from Amazon . Everything already comes included in the box . Travel might create a few tears in the box which can end up dumping some parts it all depends on the way it\u2019s handled as it travels . :)",

Simple design, easy to clean, soft to sit, won't take a lot of room, 6 people can sit, easy to move around. I was hesitant to order because while ordering it said people return this item a lot of time. It came with a lot of packaging material, so there is no damage to the items. I was able to assemble it my self. It was nicely labeled everything. You don't need any special tool to assemble. Finally very good product for the money.",

                "reviewText": "The product itself came in with a big chip on one edge of the dining table. I called in for a replacement. They sent me a new one BUT it was a nightmare returning the defective one. First, I called Amazon 3+ times for someone to pick up the return. I filled out the form for return pickup 3 times! The product was ready for return and packaged up, but no one came! They charged my card for the new one I had gotten. Let me tell you, $500 extra charged on your credit card is not a small amount. Thankfully, after going thru with Amazon CS, they refunded me my money (for the extra charges). During this, no one came to pick it up (in the span of 2 months). I moved to a new place with this baggage, planning to throw it out. It was becoming a burden. Lo and behold, after 6 months (yes, 6 months later!) I get an email that the furniture company FINALLY scheduled a pickup thru a third party. Thank god, I hadn\u2019t thrown it out! It had been sitting in the garage in a box. I had to then call Amazon and verify and make sure the third party was authentic. It was a horrible experience. I won\u2019t ever make a furniture purchase like this again from Amazon.Coming to the actual product which was in new condition, it was easy to assemble. However, you have to be careful with the chair legs. Very easy to split them apart. The table is decent size but chairs were slightly smaller than expected. I would recommend it for those with a small dining room. This dining set looks small in my dining room. I have to purchase a new set now. The quality if top notch and the dining set is definitely sturdy and beautiful. I recommend it. It did fit my apartment beautifully.",
