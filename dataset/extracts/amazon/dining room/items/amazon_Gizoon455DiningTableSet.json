                "reviewText": "So we wanted something that didn't take up a lot of space and this is perfect. It fits 4 comfortably. We love the benches. It's not very heavy but sturdy. Not woobly at all. It was one of the easiest assembly's I've done.Most importantly I want to point out how this company went above and beyond. FedEx lost our package (even though we paid $50 shipping) and denied our claim. They made me contact the seller of this product and the company immediately replaced the table with a brand new one. This says a lot about the company because it was not their fault the product was lost by FedEx.As for FedEx they get a 0 out of 5 star review because they are the worst shipping company. Every package we get from them is late or lost. Get it together FedEx. But to the seller of this product. Thank you so much for taking care of us!Highly recommend.",
