                "reviewText": "thrilled to find this product for our dining room chairs! Thought we would have to remove hundreds of staples to re-cover our 6 chairs and spend a pile of money, or spend A LOT more to have someone else do it for us. We were skeptical of the quality and fit of this product, but WOW! , what a transformation ! So quick and easy too, and they are perfect! Got the green diamond patterned ones and they look beautiful on our dark wood chairs. One tip i would mention though ,is that these covers stretch quite a bit if necessary (a good thing). You do need to remove 4 screws on the underside of the chair to put these on, but don't remove the old fabric. The old fabric will not show through these covers but will help make installation of the new covers so much easier and comfortable. Also, be mindful of which way the diamonds on the cover stretches as you pull them on!",

We were able to easily stretch them over a 1-inch-thick piece of craft foam and the seat base and have them tight and secure. These are a very rich, dark wine color. I've only had them since Thanksgiving, so I can't comment on how they'll clean. They are definitely worth the $30 I spent to recover 6 chairs we thought we were going to have to replace. Highly recommend!!",

                "reviewText": "We got these high chairs at a thrift store. They were very inexpensive and the style was exactly what we were looking for. However, the seats all had staining, some pretty severe. I considered getting them re-upholstered, but that would have countered the whole \"inexpensive\" thing. The foam was in great condition, it was just the seats themselves. Then I discovered these seat covers! Perfect! I got the \"waterproof\" ones just to prevent happening to these what happened to the original seats.The installation took time but wasn't terrible. I had to unscrew the seats, add the covers, then screw them back into place. In the process the covers added a little bit of extra depth, which then caused the existing screws to be too short to re-attach. I had some spare screws that did the trick, but I hadn't expected that complication.At the end of the day... WOW! I LOVE these! The chairs now have the perfect blend of style, character (scratches and dents). I'll be looking into these again in the future. Very nice product.",
