I highly recommend these rugs. I\u2019ve already purchased two of them and plan on purchasing more rugs to use throughout the house. If you\u2019re considering the purchase don\u2019t hesitate.

                "reviewText": "This rug is exactly what I was looking for, it looks great and fits my space very well. The quality seems to be good, but I have only had it a few days. My only complaint is it was shipped folded up into a rectangle. I still have raised lines where the bends were. I placed some books on the raised areas, and that along with gravity are mitigating the issue, although it looks like it will take a couple of weeks to become completely flat. It will be worth the effort when this happens. I think it could have been avoided by simply shipping the rug rolled up, but that may have negatively impacted their shipping cost.",

Putting a carpet protector on the floor carpet worked for a while, but I wanted something that has some \"resistance\" to it that I could lay over the plastic carpet protector. Viola! This rug did the trick!!It is FLAT. There is no pile to this rug (which is exactly what I needed). It looks nice for an under-the-desk, under-the-chair carpet and is holding up well (after a few months of use). For the price, if you need a no-pile carpet for any area in your house, apartment, or office, this is a worthy option.",
