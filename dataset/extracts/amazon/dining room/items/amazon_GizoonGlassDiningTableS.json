                "reviewText": "The table and chairs are relatively well made, chairs could be a little bit longer in the seat and a little better padded, but fine for dinners and things like that. The table could be a bit wider and longer, but the height is ok, and it all fits together pretty well. Unfortunately the finishes was all scratched up and scuffed, which, since it's jet black, is an issue, the box was fine, but the metal still had enough room to scrape around apparently. If you need a six person table and chair set that you aren't going to stare very hard at, then this will work on a budget.",

However, after o Lu six months of use, the table has become \u201csee through\u201d where scratches were sustained. The chairs are also falling apart. I must constantly redo the bolts or it\u2019ll literally fall apart. Even when done 100% correct, the chairs wiggle and wobble. They are difficult to clean.In the future we will invest in a wooden table and chair set. Going for the inexpensive version is now costing us in the long term.",
