A couple do the diagrams took a little bit to figure out. Once done, this thing looks great! It feels super sturdy. One important thing- the hinges are adjustable and include directions so you can make the doors fit in just the right positions. The shelves are also adjustable so I can actually fit my large rotisserie in the bottom of one with more room!",

Originally I thought I was missing a part but just needed to read the directions more closely. Adjusting the doors is a pain! I eventually just gave up and will live with the slight gap between one set of doors.Piece looks nice despite the wood not being the best quality.",

I did have my older teen daughter help for a little while, then my husband helped some, but it still took about 5 1/2 hours to put together. And the doors are not even and one drawer is wonky. It is fine since we still have little kids in the house that will be using it, so I'd rather not spend a lot of money on something they will probably not take great care of, but overall it looks good in our dining room. I'm using half as a coffee bar and the other side for homeschool storage. It works for what I needed. It does provide a good amount of storage space. I was able to put mugs, syrups, and coffee pods on one side, and plenty of room in the other for all their school and art supplies. I will definitely upgrade at some point, but it does the job for now.",

Needless to say a couple of pieces became warped. I laid everything out for two days with weighted stuff on top to try and flatten most of the warped pieces . After a few days I assembled this beauty and although the shelves buckle a little, and a few pieces don\u2019t meet up as perfectly as they should, it\u2019s still beautiful addition to my tiny kitchen. Customer service was amazing ! They actually sent some extra pieces, and gave me a small amount back on the piece. So in all great sideboard, and amazing customer service . Valerie -NJ",

It seems decently sturdy and looks lovely.Now\u2026let me tell you though this thing was a nightmare to assemble. I pride myself on being a patient person. More patient than most. This took me 6+ hours over two nights to put together. I swore up and down at this thing. The directions are easy enough to follow but there are SO MANY PIECES. I think a part of my soul died at one point when I was having difficulty getting it together. The amount of items I had on backwards without realizing was absurd. If I can give you any recommendation at all when you buy this and put it together because you\u2019ve decided to ignore my warning make sure you have a power drill. It will save you the smallest fraction of time.But like I said it looks great. So you\u2019ll probably be like me and ignore all the warnings and order this anyways.",
