It was not really hard to put together, we had a broken hinge & the company was super responsive & sent a new hardware kit. Once I got that fixed,the doors didn't line up & one looks too tall, the company offered me a partial refund. They were very responsive & helpful to my issues.",

The particle board (MDF) is good and the vinyl laminate covering is a good quality.I did not recieve assembly instructions, but I went to the Belleze web site and looked-up the product then found a link to the manual and downloaded the .pdf file. I took a couple of 5 minute breaks and it took me 2.5 hours by myself to assemble. Easy to assemble and the instructions only had 1 mistake. The packaging was good. Nothing was marrred or broken. Plenty of hardware and some extra.I asssembled the entire unit with my long handled phillips screwdriver and the allen wrench they provided with the hardware kit.",

It fits perfectly and had plenty of room left on top to fit an Xbox and a headset stand.Each shelf on the bottom has a cut out on the back to run wires, so additional game consoles or home theater equipment works well with the bottom compartments.I love the look. The assembly was not too difficult. It just took time. The build quality is good for the price and with proper care, should hold up for many years.",

                "reviewText": "I was surprised to see how well this was packaged! The box was big and really heavy. Poor delivery guy dragged it! Lol Good thing it did not got damaged in the process.The good: looks nice for the price, and took us about 2.5 hours to assemble, but only because we missed on the manual that there are 2 kinds of hinges! So pay extra attention to those final steps where you have to assemble the doors. Manual was easy to read and understand.I am rating a 3 and not a 5 star because the doors look really cheap compared to the rest of the piece.The last pictures show what i mean by that.**** UPDATE: Tried to have doors replaced, so I contacted the seller. We got a quick response, and although they could not send us new doors, they worked with us and we are now satisfied with the outcome.So my conclusion is: if you are okay with the quality of the doors, this is a pretty good deal. Unit is heavy and sturdy otherwise.",

This piece is great quality, feels very sturdy, and looks far more expensive than it was.The only trouble I had while putting it together was that the spots for the door hinges to be screwed in to the cabinet were too far in to work but it was easy to screw them in slightly closer to the edge and you would never notice now.Two months later I noticed a bubbling on the side that looked like there was a gouge underneath. I reached out to belleze and they were extremely helpful and quick and shipped out a replacement for that piece. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to buy more from them after the experience.",
