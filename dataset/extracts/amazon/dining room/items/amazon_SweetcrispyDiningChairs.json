I purchased these chairs for $140.00 so my expectations weren\u2019t that high being these were only meant to be temporary. However, the quality of the leather, the heaviness of the chair, the first wide-ness of the seat paired wit the comfortability. I see myself having these chairs for YEARS to come.
