Anyone with experience in putting furniture together, should get done in less than that. Don\u2019t get me started on the price. $139!!! What a steal. Don\u2019t doubt it. Buy it!!!

                "reviewText": "This dining set is amazing! I\u2019m super impressed by it and so happy I found it. I have included pictures along with a normal size, (10 pounds) house cat as a bit of reference Incase you do not have measuring tape and have a hard time visualizing the size. She just happened to be inspecting the new furniture while I was taking pictures and I thought she might be a good reference point.So basically what drew me to this set first and for most is the price! I did not have barely any money to spare towards buying a table and chair set, but really needed one for thanksgiving. Finding this one seemed too good to be true. It is cheaper than anything I found a Walmart or any thrift stores in my area and it promised to ship quickly so, after consulting reviews, I went ahead and got it. Honestly such a great decision.It arrived right on time and was so easy to put together. It took me a little while as I did it mostly by myself, but besides a little trouble tighening the screws it was a very simple and straightforward process.The table and chairs are very well made. I will admit the table wiggles a tiny bit but not anywhere enough to cause alarm. The glass on top is tempered so it\u2019s thick and can withstand extreme temperatures. The chairs might seem uneven after putting them together but when sat in they do not wiggly or move at all. The chairs are also super comfortable. I ordered the black table so my chairs were cushioned and I love them.I did notice a few reviews complaining of missing screws and did, myself, end up with the same problem, BUT I messaged the seller explaining my situation and they responded to me the same day with the promise to send out replacement screws immediately. Also since they were very polite and understanding and it is probably just a slight problem in manufacturing what with the sets being mass produced, I see no real reason to get too upset over this small, easily solved issue.All and all, amazing set and wonderful costumer service. Would 100% recommend this if you need a table for a family of 4 or smaller. Also would be wonderful for an office space.",
