                "reviewText": "This table and the customer service for the company are worthy of 5 stars. The table and chairs are shipped in two shipments (for the 2-seat table), and I was a little surprised when I received only the table. There was a paper inside the box explaining that it would be shipped in more than one, so that quelled my surprise a little. When I opened the package, I noticed some rust spots on the metal frame. By this point I was a little frustrated.By now you might be thinking why I gave it 5 stars. I contacted customer support, and they responded within a couple of days to clean the spots. I did that with some soft scrub cleaner, and they came right off. The second package arrived, and I was ready to install it. I have to say that it is a very cute and practical table for a small space. I was specifically looking for a white table, which is kind of difficult, but this one looked nice and was priced right. I like that the glass has a blue frost that went well with my d\u00e9cor.There were some surprises at the beginning, but with the responsiveness of customer support, the overall look of the table, and the price, I give it 5 stars.",

The chairs are decently comfortable but nothing crazy. You will get the chairs in a different package, and for us it was on a different day. The only thing I did not love was some parts came with some reddish dust on them (almost like rust). Most of it came off with a cleaning wipe. Overall I think it is a good bang for your buck!

If I went to a furniture store it would be $500.00 and I would have to wait 3 to 6 weeks. Amazon did the thing with one.",
