The table is pretty much sturdy and easy to clean. I received the package two days back and assembled it same day. Assembling took may be a couple of hours. The seat cushions were hard to align and each chair perhaps took 10-15 minutes. I liked the rounded corners in the table. If you have small kids then you would truly appreciate that.The chairs look really nice for the price paid for the whole set. Those balance pretty well and hopefully kids would not topple those over. The table top perhaps is veneer so it shines well, and as is the case with any veneer furniture, always use table mats to avoid heat stains. This is a good option if you have a limited space.",

The funny metric tool bit and metric screws were difficult. I was so frustrated. And it felt like it took forever to assemble. My hand was sore afterwards. However, since it is assembled now, I am pleased with the outcome. I was so pleased, I took myself out to eat instead of serving myself a meal on the dinette set. I\u2019ll around to it. Assembly is a pain, but as a final assembled product only, I do recommend. Enjoy!",
