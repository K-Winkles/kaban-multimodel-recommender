                "reviewText": "Sometimes I do write reviews - either for exceptionally good products or because of a bad product I bought.This table is beautiful and solid/sturdy and well designed/engineered.Assembly instructions are clear. I had a young helper ( always teach my kid to learn some new skills). I told him not to tighten screws until all part in place ( from my personal experience, as a handyman), but apparently even that step was marked in the assembly instructions booklet. All parts were clearly marked. What impressed me most, that every single type of fastener/washer had one extra in the set. If you misplace one - it\u2019s not an issue anymore.Beautiful and sturdy table. great engineering for easy assembly. Oh, the table was well packed in the way, that not to be damaged during shipping. This was my biggest fear, when I received a long, heavy box ( by FedEx I believe) and one of the corners was smashed. I took a video before opening the box and was relieved to see there was so much protective foam on each side and all corners, so no parts were damaged.I Highly recommend to support this brand/seller.",

                "reviewText": "I got the gold metal with white top and regretted that decision. The gold is more like an orange yellow, the hardware doesn\u2019t match it so it definitely is noticeable. The white top came damaged it some sort of hollow particle board so there\u2019s a hole. I live where it\u2019s hard to return items and reached out to the company for at least a new piece and they said it would take two months to send a replacement. So offered a 50% discount. That was nice of them I guess but I still have a hole in my table.The metal frame is solid. The table top\u2026 eh. The design does fit six chairs on each side nicely but the ends are awkward. The edge of the table ends exactly where the metal does so there\u2019s no lip and really no way of putting a chair at the end nicely.",
