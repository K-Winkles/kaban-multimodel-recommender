The most complicated part (the mechanism used to slide it out so you can put in the leaf) was already put together, so for people who struggle with instructions, it's easier than most. Pretty good quality. None of the terrible fake wood you screw stuff in either. It's all metal you screw things into, which is much better than most of this type of furniture you buy. Def recommend.",

The black is pretty, however this finish catches and holds finger prints and hand prints. All you have to do is barely touch it and you have prints so just know you will be wiping it down fairly often. The benches are really small. They are fine for kids, even bigger kids but not real practical for full size adults. 2 adults can sit on each bench but not very comfortably. My husband and I each weigh 175 lbs and they were just too thin for us so I bought a set of black chairs on Amazon, so for $300 I have a super nice set I\u2019m happy with. The table and benches are very sturdy and seem like they will hold up for a long time. **NOTE** the benches DO fit under the table when it\u2019s not extended. When the leaf is removed only the top slides. Not the entire frame of the table. I like this feature for space saving.",

                "reviewText": "We bought this table because we have a compact space in our dining area, and a medium sized family. We've got 3 kids- aged 12, 12, and 3. This table is amazing. It arrived beautifully packaged, has a tough table top, and the benches are wide enough to fit a bigger bottom, but small enough to sit nicely under the table. The leaf is sturdy and has a fantastic fit. It only took my husband and me 30 minutes to put together, and it's rock solid. The little corner protectors so that when our 3 year old is zooming around, he doesn't end up with bumps from the corners. It looks exactly like the picture. Fantastic table for the price!",

                "reviewText": "Not hard to assemble, except figuring out the rotary knob. Delivered on time; all pieces in tact. Seems sturdy. Is kind of low (H= 30in) for taller individuals. My daughter is 5\u20196; the table feels small / low to her. Definitely opens up space. Resembles a picnic table. Benches hold weight well (I\u2019m a chunky one). Is NOT scratch resistant. I recommend a table cloth to preserve the newness and flawlessness. Shows ANY oil and FINGER PRINTS easily and immediately. Overall, worth the buy; not horribly expensive, not cheap enough to raise an eyebrow.",
