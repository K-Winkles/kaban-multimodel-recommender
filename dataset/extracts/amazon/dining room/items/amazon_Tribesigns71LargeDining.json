The only heavy part is the metal bracing for the legs and underneath the table. It\u2019s made with paper which is fine but it\u2019s not even thick enough to be mailed and had huge holes in the carton .I contacted the seller because I was going to request a partial refund because my boyfriend was going to patch it up and we would use outside as a work table because we couldn\u2019t figure out how to get it back into the box. The seller kept pretending like I never ordered the table from them. Do not purchase",
