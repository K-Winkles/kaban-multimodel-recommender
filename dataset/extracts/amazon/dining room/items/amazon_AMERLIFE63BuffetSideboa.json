However, it exceeded my expectations! the instructions were very easy and through to follow, took about an hour or so to put it together. The only part I had trouble with was at the end, which doors attach to the wood panels. I did mess up but luckily I was able to swap the magnets to the opposite side and all was good! Only thing I was bummed about was one of the door panels came scratched, but not enough of a bother to complain. Definitely worth the purchase!",
