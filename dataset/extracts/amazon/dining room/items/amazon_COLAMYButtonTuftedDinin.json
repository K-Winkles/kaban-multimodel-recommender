Chairs were easy to assemble. Gorgeous color and material with the existing dining table we have. Recommend Scotch Guarding the chairs for accidental spills and normal wear and tear. Great price for a set of 4!",

                "reviewText": "For years, I have been searching for the perfect chairs to replace the original chairs that I bought with my solid wood table. I bought two completely different sets (one from a different seller) and put one chair from each set together to compare. It was an easy choice! These chairs have a very plush fabric (so soft) and the gray is so lovely (as you can see in the third picture). The wooden legs perfectly match my table. The seat of the chair is firm yet comfortable. They seem like they will last a long time. It took some time to put together the chairs since there were six of them, but I was able to do it without any issues. They even provided extra hardware. So happy with my purchase!",
