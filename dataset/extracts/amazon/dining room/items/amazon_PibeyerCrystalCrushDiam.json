I have a cut glass mirror about 32\" wide, and I thought matching ends for each side of it would look great. I was right! These mirror match so perfectly yo would have thought I purchased them along with the other wall mount. Oh and the price is very, very affordable, I was surprised when I reviewed the price before buying. ( well under $50.00) they are so decorative and look mor expensive then they were. If you want to brighton your walls, buying four ( if you don't have a center piece) would be perfect.",
