We had to assemble the product ourselves.Then I checked Amazon. A set of better quality chairs was for only $250, free delivery. Of course, we had to assemble the chairs ourselves.The chairs were nicely packed - two in a box. The boxes were easy to receive in our home. Assembly was quite easy. Amazon offered Asurion warranty for $50 for three years.The chairs are very elegant and comfortable. Light weight and special sliders at the bottom of the wooden legs make it easy to slide (or lift) the chairs.All in all, I would highly recommend this product who is looking for high value and high quality.",

                "reviewText": "I'll write my honest review because I want people should really know what to expect when buying these chairs .First of all , they're nice ,neat, and comfortable ,elegant , sturdy enough to sit on them , lightweight enough to move them around , when you sit down on them at the table you'll move in smooth while sitting down and when getting up you'll move out smoothly as well, we bought 6 chairs and we're happy.Now when it comes to installation you can see in the customer reviews that it takes very long for assembly , and the holes between the legs and the cushion are not lined up so its very difficult to find the hole to turn in the screws.Which I must say is true , I also watched the installation video here on the site , I have no idea how he turns those screws in with that Allen wrench that comes with it so effortlessly , not in my dreams.We started the first chair by screwing in the middle screw with that Allen wrench enclosed first like it says in the instructions and like he does in the video, for us it was impossible to screw in the other 4 screws with the Allen wrench , 2 at each end , we tried very long and we gave up , and brought the drill out , we have the tool that fits for this screw .We worked differently , we screwed in 1 screw on the right 75 percent then 1 screw on the left 75 percent then the second screw on the right 75 percent then the second screw on the left 75 percent then the screw in the middle , with the drill we were able to match up the holes very quickly , and then we tightened up all the screws 1 by 1 and it worked out very nicely .The other 5 chairs were a breeze , less than 5 minutes per chair to assemble .If you have access to a drill definitely use a drill in this order , corners first then the center screw . We hope to enjoy the chairs for a very long time .Only the 2 front legs have level screws on the bottom , on a few of the chairs even after turning out the level screw to the Max it still wobbles a bit when not sitting on them , once you sit down on those chairs , there's no wobbling whatsoever which is kind of magic but great.Enjoy your chairs",
