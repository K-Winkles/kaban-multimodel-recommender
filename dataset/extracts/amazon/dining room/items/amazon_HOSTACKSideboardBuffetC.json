                "reviewText": "This sideboard is very nice and very sturdy for a fantastic price!! It did take an afternoon to put it together as noted, but it went together easily and without any issues. It holds a ton of items, so we were able to clear out multiple shelves and drawers in the kitchen and reorganize there. This fits in beautifully with our farmhouse decor. We are very pleased with this purchase!",

                "reviewText": "Overall I am very happy with my purchase. It\u2019s beautiful, sturdy, the perfect height to keep my big dogs off, and has added much needed counter space.Building it was a bit tedious. It took most of the day to build between help from the pups and being a bit \ud83c\udf43\ud83d\udca8. Directions are easy enough to follow with the exception of a few steps where the illustration showed predrilled holes on the outside when they were in fact inside certain parts.I used an electric screw driver, a drill could be too much power to put this together, and at times I screwed bits in by hand for fear of cracking the boards. There are several holes that should have been predrilled a bit wider (around cabinet hinges especially), I ended up widening a few on my own because otherwise the paint and wood would absolutely have cracked if I was too rough.This unit is VERY heavy. I received this a week early (YAY), and thankfully I was home because it had rained. I ended up opening the box to bring in bits at a time since I didn\u2019t have help.Putting on the cabinet doors was an absolute chore. Despite being very careful about aligning the hinges, the doors were still crooked with awful gaps. It took A LOT of adjusting and I had to widen predrilled holes cause it was cracking when I would tighten my screws. I would secure everything, loosen my screws, align the door and then slowly tighten again till I was satisfied. Not all the screws that were anchored in were completely straight by the time I was done- but I don\u2019t care anymore cause they look straight from the outside now.This unit was packaged perfectly. There were several deep dents and gouges in the cardboard and I thought for sure something would have been damaged but it came out entirely unscathed! Very impressed.Overall I\u2019d really like to leave a 4 star review, taking off half a star for some quality control concerns with the tight anchor points, chipping/cracking wood, and another half star for those annoying cabinets that I was eventually able to straighten.",

When we opened it the top was broken, its holding on by a thread.. There is a lot of wood and paint chips/scratches. (See the pictures) It was terrible to put together. The door do not match the frame so they scratch against it. It looks like it was just thrown together. All in all I am extremely disappointed.",
