                "reviewText": "I was looking for a deeply moisturizing body cream with a nice scent and scent wise, I'm more than happy with this. It's not perfumey or cloying, but the Rose scent is just right with hints of underlying citrus that actually creates a uniquely pleasant fragrance. While it is thick and creamy out of the tube, and it does feel softening and moisturizing, I'm taking a star off for the fact that it could be MORE intensely moisturizing than it is. When you first apply cream, it always feels a bit greasy or tacky. That's pretty normal. After you apply you'll probably want to wash your hands but the plus side is, if you feel that it is initially TOO tacky or greasy, once you wash your hands, after you rinse, you can use your wet hands to rub the lotion in further and your hands will become less so. Even so, I find is that it is hard to find ANY lotion or cream where the moisture isn't just a temporary feeling that leaves your skin a little soft, but doesn't retain the moisture barrier you need, particularly if you are prone to dry skin. But this is a keeper and I like it enough to continue keep using it. The best body moisturizer I've used was the Curel brand, especially their Ultra Healing for hands and body lotion. It's so good if you only apply it 3 times a week, its good enough on skin to skip some days or in between showering its benefits are extended. Unfortunately, they changed their formula slightly about 5 years ago but again, for me it's the best one I've found.",

When I saw the Jergens Lavender lotion, well simply had to order it. It was the Lavender scent that intrigued me. Love lavender. The lotion itself feels wonderful on one's skin. I highly reccomend this to anyone that has dry skin. It goes on smooth and feels great!",
