It would have saved me from buying a lot of lotions that don't do as they claim! This lotion is wonderful. It really does absorb quickly and completely. My skin feels soft and looks younger for over a day after applying! It has a very subtle scent and doesn't clash with your perfume. It would work equally for men too. My husband tried it and loves how it made his skin feel.I'm really glad I found this. Seeing as it's a generic I wasn't sure - you know how that works. But so far Amazon Basic products have really impressed me and I plan on ordering more! BTW it even feels great on my face!",

                "reviewText": "Firstly, I clean for a living and spend a lot of time cooking and doing dishes by hand. So naturally I wash my hands A LOT! I've wasted so much money on lotions. I started to believe they don't work, OR I was doing something wrong. This lotion does have a slight oily residue, which holds moisture in. I will have to wait a few minutes to touch anything (under 5 mins). I've noticed after a few days my hands are way better. If you're conflicted but need strong lotion, this is it. If you need something less heavy duty, look elsewhere. This is for working hands that are under attack constantly or severly dry skin. At A STEAL OF A PRICE TOO!",
