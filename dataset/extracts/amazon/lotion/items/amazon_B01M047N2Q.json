When Used Daily, O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s Skin Repair is clinically proven to: Provide instant relief Moisturize and protect against dryness for 48 Hours Help prevent flare ups associated with dry, itchy skin Absorb quickly into your skin Last through showering Safe and Effective for skin that is impacted by Diabetes and Eczema. Directions: Apply a small amount to dry skin - it's all you need. Reapply as needed throughout the day. Note: Packaging may vary between yellow or white bottles. Dispensing Tips: Our body moisturizer is highly concentrated and thicker than many other lotions. If you experience any difficulty in getting the product to dispense with the pump you may want to try the following: Shake the bottle to redistribute the lotion. Unscrew the cap and lift the entire pump out of the bottle a bit, then set it back on the bottle and screw the cap back on so it is tight and does not move. This is putting air back in the bottle which helps in releasing the pump to dispense the lotion. It may also take extra priming of the pump to draw the lotion up into the straw for dispensing.",

                "reviewText": "The pump on mine wouldn't work either. I removed the clear tube from the pump (just pull it off, it looks like a clear plastic straw), wiped off one end of the tube, then blew HARD into it until the thick lotion came all the way out the other end of the tube. Ran hot water through the tube, reinserted the tube, and viola! Pump works fine now.I have old, extremely dry skin, especially on my inner arms and have been using Gold Bond Overnight (good stuff), but wanted the ease of a pump. This cream is slightly less effective than the Overnight, but if I use enough of it, it works well, soaks in, not greasy at all. Best of all, no scent to interfere with perfumes.Hope the broken pump tip helps others!",
