It's a hard place to get lotion on after a shower and this was the answer to my prayers. So easy to apply, the scent is subtle, doesn't irritate my sensitive skin and is great for your whole body. Quicker than moisturizing your skin all over After your shower. When it became impossible for me to find anywhere in Ontario Canada for a few years, I was devastated. Needless to say I'm so glad to have found it on Amazon. It is the best product ever.",
