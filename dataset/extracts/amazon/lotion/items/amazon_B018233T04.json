                "reviewText": "I live in Minnesota, where it gets really dry in the Winter, AND have radiant heat, which really lowers the humidity. This leads to severely dry skin; so much so that I often find myself scratching myself until my dry, cracked skin bleeds.I have tried most OTC moisturizers, and the best I'd found before now was Gold Bond Diabetic Dry Skin Relief. But it seems to not work as well as it used to (is ANYTHING better since the pandemic?); it didn't absorb well, just sitting on top of my skin and leaving a layer of lotion.My next door neighbour recommended Adamia Therapeutic Repair lotion, and gave me a sample to try.I have to say that it is the best thing yet! It absorbs readily, feels amazing, and keeps the painful and infuriating itching down \"to a dull roar,\" as my father used to say.Unlike some reviewers here, I'm not looking for it to make my skin look younger, just to make the itching at least manageable, and it does that pretty well. If you suffer (and I mean SUFFER, not just \"have\") from really dry skin, I highly recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "I have purchased this lotion several times for my husband and elderly In-Laws. This is very nice lotion. A bit greasy at first, but soaks in nicely after a few minutes. Does not stain clothes. The fragrance is good for men or women, young or old. Very subtle and not perfumey at all. My husband had hand surgery earlier this year and his PT asked what he was using on his scar tissue because it was nicely hydrated and softer than most scar tissue. He told her it was Adamia Repair Lotion and showed her a photo of the bottle on his phone on his next visit. She was very impressed with the healing quality. One bottle lasts quite a while. Try it.",

                "reviewText": "I bought Adamia to help heal bruises on my 75 year old arms. In 2 days the bruises were visibly lighter. In 7 days they were almost gone. I\u2019ve been using it every day and my skin doesn\u2019t seem to bruise as easily as before. I\u2019ve also had rough cracked heels for years, even though I used various lotions and creams, including Cera-ve. Three weeks of Adamia applications have almost completely restored my feet. Reviews on Amazon gave me hope that this product was different than the rest. When I tell my fellow oldsters about Adamia they just roll their eyes because they think there\u2019s no hope for old skin. You have nothing to lose if you buy on Amazon with free return. This product is Awesome!",

I am 60 years old and noticed crepey skin on my inner arms last year but because I was healing from surgery, I just shrugged it off thinking, bah, I\u2019ll get my arms back in shape when I can. Moving forward, and a year later, I need 2 more surgeries and looking at my arms, horrified me. Thinking what have I done and more importantly, what can I do? Amazon search. Because of all the great reviews, I purchased this cream and OMG!! For me, it\u2019s life changing. It\u2019s absolutely amazing, and honestly, it\u2019s been only 4 days of applying it 3 times a day\u2026liberally. The wrinkly, crepes are minimal (almost gone) I am so happy, and confident now, I am wearing all my sleeveless summer dresses, and am dumbfounded at the incredible results. I put this cream EVERYWHERE. Forehead to my toes and quickly and greedily, ordered 2 more bottles. Never, ever have I liked a lotion so much. It works! I am over-the-moon happy. It is my fountain of youth, and puts a smile on my face as I\u2019m applying it! Thank you, thank you. Thank you so much. \ud83d\udc95\ud83c\udf38\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc9e\ud83c\udf37",
