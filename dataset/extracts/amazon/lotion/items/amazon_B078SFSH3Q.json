                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great value, neutral lotion",
                "reviewText": "I noticed a few other reviews said this lotion absorbs too quickly to be used for massage, but I found a solution. By itself, this lotion is basic, and very neutral. It's unscented, feels thick enough to offer relief on dry skin, but quickly absorbs and doesn't feel greasy at all. Sometimes, that's exactly what I need. I work in for a pharmaceutical manufacturer and cannot have heavy or scented products. We aren't even supposed to wear makeup or hair products. This lotion is perfect for work because it absorbs nicely and I can still get gloves on easily.I love that this is such a great value. For the price, I can't beat the amount of lotion. It's like a lifetime supply! (Not really, but still a lot) Because I had so much to work with, I wasn't afraid to waste some and experiment with adding scents and oils. I found that adding this with a tiny bit of jojoba oil, vitamin e oil, and my favorite scent oil, to a small pump bottle, the consistency doesn't change too much, but the absorbency changes drastically. I don't need much scent because it carries through the unscented lotion nicely, like a blank canvas. The oils make it slicker and better for massage or after a shower. I'm sure I could add even more oil to get a richer result. Sometimes you actually want a greasy feeling lotion to lock in the moisture. Even with the added cost of the oils and scent, my finished product is still substantially cheaper than the lotion I was using with a similar scent, and feels so much nicer. (It's like 1/10 of the cost!)So yes, this lotion does absorb too quickly for massage, but I still recommend it. If you plan to put this in a different bottle (like a pump bottle or squeeze) I recommend cutting a small hole in the foil, close to the rim, and poking a tiny hole on the opposite side as an air vent. Then you can squeeze it from the jug right into a new container without making a mess. My foil popped off halfway through the jug, but at least the first half was easy to use.",

                "reviewText": "I love this stuff. I use lotion all over after my shower every day. I wanted something that produces fewer empty bottles and that I wouldn\u2019t have to restock so often. This stuff goes on nicely, isn\u2019t sticky or greasy after applied, but does leave me feeling moisturized. No dry feeling, skin feels supple without that unpleasant coating some lotions have, truly no fragrance, and it\u2019s the most cost-effective option. The difference I feel when using this does measure up to my previous various favorites from over the years as I weeded out the ones that didn\u2019t do anything. As an avid lotion user, I\u2019m very happy with this one. I also occasionally have flare ups of eczema and whatnot, which this does not irritate at all- it\u2019s quite nice to apply over it, in fact. I do recommend also buying their pump, because it\u2019s way easier to just stick the pump in than try to move some to another bottle. The only problem I have with this at all is that the last bit of it does become hard to get out as you near the end of the pump\u2019s tube. I give it a whack to move the lotion to the very bottom, then just buy a new one a little early, use it for a bit to make some room, then use the last of my nearly-empty one to top off the new one.Overall good quality everyday lotion at a great price and in convenient quantities with less packaging. Have bought a few times and will buy again.",

                "reviewText": "Out of all of Ginger Lily Farms products (of which I am a huge fan) this is the very best! It was the first product I ordered when I worked at a birth center and we needed an excellent nourishing lotion that could be used on every client. It is extremely moisturizing. The price is excellent. It does have a very slight scent, which I would describe as clean and fresh. I never had a single complain about this lotion from hundreds of women.We recently moved to an extremely dry part of the country, so I now order this lotion by the gallon for my own household. We have tried some of the scented lotions from this company, and although most of our family members enjoyed the scented versions, we do have a couple people with ultra sensitive skin (including eczema and psoriasis) for whom the unscented version is the best and most economical lotion we have found. So now it is the only lotion I order.Be sure to order a pump which is also sold by this company to help dispense the lotion. The pumps are reuseable so are a one-time investment. Overall, you will find that this lotion is an extrememly gentle and money-saving option. I am so thankful I found it!",

This is the one!! The smell isn\u2019t wonderful, but it is very faint and disappears after a minute or two. You could always add a couple drops of your favorite essential oil, too. Leaves my skin super soft, and without any residue tackiness. Perfect dupe for the Whole Foods 365 brand unscented lotion that\u2019s impossible to find anymore. Super affordable, too!! It\u2019s annoying to see that people are giving it not-great reviews solely because it rubs in pretty quickly (making it not the best lotion for massage) when I don\u2019t see anywhere that it\u2019s advertised as a massage lotion\u2026",

It feels good at first but, before I'm even done my opening techniques it absorbs into the clients skin and I feel like I have sticky gecko hands. On the other hand my hands are very soft now. Maybe if there was a bit of coconut oil or something to give more glide this would work better as something beyond hand cream.",
