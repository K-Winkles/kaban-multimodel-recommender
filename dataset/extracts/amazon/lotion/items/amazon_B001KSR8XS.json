Japanese Cherry Blossom it's an absolutely wonderful sweet scent that has a lasting aroma that is sure get many compliments. The product is wonderful but the company is even better due to the issues that I have the company was able to help me and getting a semi-large quantity and also other products in that line the body wash, hand lotion, body spray, and even a candle if I was interested. I did purchase the hand lotion, body wash, body lotion and body spray. I really appreciate all you've done for me and my issue. They were extremely helpful and polite.
