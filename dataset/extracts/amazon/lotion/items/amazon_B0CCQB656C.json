I'm obsessed with everything about it \u2013 except for the size versus the price. Chapstick is there to compare size. It's a bit on the smaller side, and that's my only gripe. While the fragrance lingers beautifully, I find myself rationing it because I don't want to run out too quickly. If the price matched a slightly larger container, this lotion would be perfection.

Unfortunately she only tested it out to see what it was like because Amazon had shipped it in a box with a book we had also ordered separately. They did not secure it at all inside, and the dispenser was broken when we opened the delivery package. We were just lucky the cream didn't get out and ruin the book which was a Christmas gift I got for my sister. Amazon, please package this more safely next time.",
