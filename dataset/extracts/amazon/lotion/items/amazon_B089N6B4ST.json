I used it 5 minutes ago and I feel like I will be sleeping on clouds tonight LOL. My 3 year old daughter said her skin was itchy and I used it on her so no complaints as of right now. If you\u2019re thinking about getting it, BUY IT NOW!",

                "reviewText": "I wasn't sure if this was going to be too greasy and when I opened it up, it looked like it would be, but it sank right into my skin. Has a fragrance (would prefer that it didn't), but it is pleasant and not overpowering. It did give my collar bones a nice glow, but that didn't last too long (but I'm also a bit dehyhdrated so that may be specific to me). I think it is worth a try! Really impressed by how fast it absorbed into my skin and the softness it gave my skin.",

I use my regular lotion (for my stretch marks) and then put this one on top. My skin does not feel dry at all by the end of the day. I\u2019m going to buy a back up and it also smells amazing, I love walking into my room after using this.",

Yea, it does leave a nice subtle glow as well. Now there is a slight fragrance to it but once it\u2019s on the skin it goes away after a few minutes. This is something that i definitely will be repurchasing.",
