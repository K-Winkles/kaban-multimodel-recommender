It adds wonderful, long lasting hydration to my skin, without the scent of cocoa butter. It is truly, fragrance free (where as other lotions / creams claim to be fragrance free, yet seem to have fragrance). I will absolute be ordering more. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "My mother has used the original cocoa butter lotion for as long as I can remember(I used to call it the \u201ccereal lotion\u201d because it smells just like coco puffs). Anyways, I\u2019m a die hard fan of the lotion, but as I\u2019ve matured I just don\u2019t like the scent and it clashes with my floral scents I use. The unscented formula feels and dries the exact same way as the original, and this way I can empty the bottles, mix in some essential oils, and refill them to tailor the scent to my desires. My skin is dry and eczema prone and the formula in palmers is perfect for every day use- it\u2019s even great in the winter for helping prevent my flare ups, though I still need specialized creams when I do get patches. On its own it has the most subtle raw cocoa butter scent which I love(think very dark chocolate, with some earthy notes). If you've never smelt raw cocoa butter, it may seem \u201coff putting\u201d but that\u2019s just how it is. No need to be alarmed. The 3 bottles are a great deal as well:)",
