I bought this lotion for the first time and was kind of disappointed with the texture/smell. I learned quickly that you only need a small amount because otherwise, it will leave your skin feeling sticky for quite some time after use. The smell also isn't my favorite (not that it's bad or anything), but just not as good as some of their other scents. However, it does do a good job at keeping the skin moisturized, so it does what it's intended to do. Overall, I would recommend this product but would probably not buy again for myself.",
