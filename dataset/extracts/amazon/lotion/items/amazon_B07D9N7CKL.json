I stayed over in Hilton Hotel and they had Pharmacopia lemon body wash, shampoo, conditioner and body lotion in the bathroom. After a day in the sun i decided I should put on some moisturizer and used the Citrus Body lotion that was in the bathroom, To my surprise it was not greasy and the scent was pure and clean. I could tell it was a high quality product and upon further examination found it to be all natural and clean. I then used the shampoo and conditioner and body wash and found all of them to be amazing. The lemon scent was vibrant and uniquely clean smelling, The scent remained on my skin and i received compliments from the other wedding guests informing me how nice my cologne smelled, unbeknownst that it was body lotion.I looked up Pharmacopia and found that it was available on Amazon. I bought the lotion and body wash. Its a staple in the bathroom now. Once you try Pharmacopia nothing else will do. They are the best.",

                "reviewText": "This was discovered through a small sample I got staying at a hotel, I think. I threw it into my bag and didn\u2019t think anymore about it until I went away on a trip and found myself needing a moisturizer and found this in my bag. It was so startlingly good I used every last drop of it then found myself comparing everything else to it and missing it. Ordered a full size and I\u2019ve never looked back. It is now one of my holy-grail moisturizers (and my DIL says I have the softest skin of anyone she knows). I love that it has a pump so it\u2019s extremely easy to use, never messy, and less waste. The scent is so fresh and bright and always makes me feel like I just pumped up a good mood in scent form. The moisturizer itself smooths on delightfully with no stickiness and the perfect viscosity - not too thick and not watery or runny. It soaks in and leaves my skin feeling sooo super smooth. Whenever I use it my husband comments on how soft my skin is. As a point of reference, my skin usually tends toward the dry side. This is, in my book, my perfect body moisturizer.",

It is similar to a spa lotion which I can never find anywhere so I use it as a close substitute. It does come out of the pump quite generously so be aware because you don't need too much if just applying to your hands.",

I love the scent, however, the lotion itself is a little bit watery for my liking. I feel like the thicker the product, the more moisture it deposits. I do feel like it moisturizes well though, so if you're looking for a lighter consistency in a lotion, this would be for you! I will continue to purchase just for the amazing scent.",
