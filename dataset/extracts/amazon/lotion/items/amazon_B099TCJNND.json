                "reviewText": "I really like this stuff. It does what it claims to do. Unique texture and hand feel. I don't have to use a lot; reapply only about twice an hour. (I\u2019ve learned to start with a bit more on my hand to begin with). It's a bit less slippery than Albolene (which is all oils) but also less messy. However, it is much more costly. But, it seems a little goes a long way. My personal analysis is simple--So Low offers a very nice tactile-sensual experience that I think is just right for longer sessions of row-your-own-canoe handiwork.A Russian proverb (paraphrased) says, \"We each row our own boat in our own way.\" When I'm the captain of the boat, I've found this to be a nice, unique, satisfying first-mate to have at hand (right or left). I understand that some people may stick with the many gummy, quick-to-dry-out lotions they are used to (remember the Russians). That\u2019s cool. For them.I suggest trying it, especially if you like long edging sessions. I've bought a second tube before the first is used up and a smaller tube at a local big box store (for a logical 1/2 the price of the bigger one) just for travel. The fact that I want some with me when traveling is a big, strong thumb's up from me\u2014from both hands.",

                "reviewText": "I was skeptical at first, due to the mainstreamed nature of this product and the cost. I wasn't sure how long it would last. I'm a big fan now. I bought my first container in early September and there is still some left in late December, and I use it A LOT! I use it at least once a day, sometimes twice.I wouldn't consider it a lotion, but a cream....but it warms up to be like a lotion.I am circumcised so I need it for self pleasure to be more long lasting. I really like this stuff. I do need to apply it once or twice for each session, depending how long I am edging. I shared it with some friends when hanging out and edging, they love it too. When reapplying using the same hand with the lotion on it, the container doesn't get sticky. It's easy to clean up and my keyboard and phone wipes up easy too.I'm very much looking forward to my next container. I live overseas and having it shipped here too.",
