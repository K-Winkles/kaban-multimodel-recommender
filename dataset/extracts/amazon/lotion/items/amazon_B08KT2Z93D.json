                "reviewText": "UPDATE: Okay so this will probably just be a hand lotion when I\u2019m out of my regular lotion, from now on. The scent doesn\u2019t last on me (that\u2019s fine - most scents don\u2019t hang around for too long). The problem is - it turns into a lactonic skin scent - *on me*. I shower before bed and I put this on my arms, neck and hands - and go to sleep. Each time, I wake up smelling like milk. I\u2019ve never experienced this before. Not spoiled milk - just - milk. Not the warm and inviting scent I\u2019m going for. Also - due to circumstances - I don\u2019t sleep very long. So this turns, in 3-4 hours. Bummer because I really liked it. I still have my vanilla bean Noel lotion from B&BW and it scratches the same itch but this lotion feels so much better/more moisturizing so I\u2019m bummed. My search for a decent vanilla lotion continues.Smells identical to B&BW VBN - if you know, you know. So while the fragrance is spot on the same - it\u2019s less cloying than VBN (which hits far too heavy on the caramel note - the caramel overshadows everything). But this EOS lotion? Perfection! It\u2019s not cloying. It\u2019s perfectly sweet and rich but not overly so, in either direction. I put this on after my bed time shower and it\u2019s a nice soothing scent.As for the lotion consistency - it\u2019s phenomenal! It\u2019s thick but satin-y. It\u2019s not greasy at all. The thickness means you need to rub it in a bit more but once it\u2019s dry - you\u2019re moisturized and you\u2019re also dry - no weird residue! My skin loves it. I have super thirty skin that steals moisture and fragrance from all my products. This still feels really nice, 4 hours after applying. I highly recommend it! Due to the fragrance, tho - I\u2019d either wear this alone or pair with a similar scent profile in other frags (vanilla, cashmere). For what it\u2019s worth - I own BBW VBN lotion. This smells better and outperforms it (moisturizing) a hundred times over. Highly recommend!",

I hate light lotions during the winter time so I was worried I wouldn't be thick to my liking but I was wrong. Its a nice size bottle and it feels so smooth on the skin after applying. It has no smell what so ever and it does not smell weird at all considering it has no smell. I don't know about you guys but sometimes lotion can smell weird when it's not scented in my opinion. I would definitely recommend for adults and kids",

                "reviewText": "It kinda smells like iceing. I love it. Goes on a little strong but after a few mins it calms down. The smell is very gender neutral. It would be paired well with sweet feminine vanilla/ coconut. But for us it would also be paired very well with a coconut musk, or just a smell with more musk notes. def makes me smell edible, I would say its worth the hype. Mainly because yeah it smells pretty damn good, but also it makes my skin feel like butter. I use lotion often but this lotion is so thick and creamy, and they shea butter really hydrates the skin. I pair this with fresh cream warm cashmir by philosophy, I use the body wash and the perfume and I use Oat milk latte deodorant by native and I smell amazing.",

This Vanilla Cashmere smells like some sort of vanilla cheesecake - but not in a good way. Aside from the scent, I do like the lotion. It's very thick and rich, goes on nicely. It absorbs well and doesn't leave a greasy feel on your skin. It seems to moisturize fairly well and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and supple. I don't think I'll buy this scent again, but I do like this brand of lotion.",
