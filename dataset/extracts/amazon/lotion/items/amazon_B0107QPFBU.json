                "reviewText": "I don't know what black magic is in this tube, but it WORKS!I used to have the most chronically chapped and peeling lips ever. I tried everything - drinking tons of water, applying Chapstick, Burt's Bees, Carmex, O'Keefe's, and even Vaseline throughout the day...some brands were better for my lips than others, but I always had to re-apply them anywhere from hours to minutes later. The peeling skin was always there, the chapstick just kinda stuck it down, but eventually the chapstick would dry from my lips and the skin would come up again.I could never wear lipstick because it looked awful with my peeling skin. I developed a nervous habit of chewing on my lips, trying to bite off the peeling skin, which of course was a vicious negative spiral which caused my lips to peel more and eventually bleed. The only relief I could get was with super hydrating lip gloss, but then my lips were glittery and super shiny and wet looking, which made me look like a teenager lost in the 90s. I wanted matte-lipped sophistication, damnit!Then I tried Aquaphor. I figured, why not, I've tried everything else, and this big tube is pretty cheap. When I first opened it, I thought it was basically repackaged Vaseline based on its consistency. Vaseline hadn't worked for me in the past so I was a bit disappointed, but smeared a little on my lips right before bed anyways. The next morning, my lips were still moist from the product. I washed my face and wiped off my lips. The dry, dead, peeling skin from the night before had been moisturized into goo that just wiped off, revealing seamlessly healthy skin underneath. No cracks. No edges of dead skin that would start peeling again. Just perfectly moisturized lips like all of the advertisements that I had told myself were photoshopped over the years. I couldn't believe it. Was I one of those people with good lips now?? I thought I had been genetically doomed!I brought the big bottle of aquaphor with me to work, thinking I would need to reapply it to keep my magically healed lips moisturized and happy (after all, even with the most moisturizing chapsticks I still had to reapply every couple of hours). I didn't need it the whole day, even after eating and wiping off my lips. The cracks never reappeared, my lips didn't dry out, no dead peeling skin in sight! I started wearing lipstick sometimes, never having to worry about it collecting on my dead flakey skin.Now, all I do is rub a thin bead of Aquaphor on my lips right before bed (it only takes a little - this bottle is going to last me several years!). Sometimes I get so used to healthy, uncracked lips that I forget to use Aquaphor for a few days, and then my lips start peeling again. All it takes is one application at night and they're back to being healthy and moisturized again! I squeezed some Aquaphor into a little contained to bring with me when I travel, but I don't even bother keeping it in my purse any more because I never need it throughout the day. I used to buy chapstick in bulk so I would always have one or two in every purse, upstairs, downstairs, in my car, at work, or anywhere I'd be. No more! This humble product has changed my life!",

After reading reviews and comparing to other moisturizers, I chose this product because it's water repellent but still lets air through while working wonders on your skin. I use this all the time now and rarely use regular lotion. It keeps my skin hydrated and to my surprise also helps with crepe looking skin. We've also used this on burns and small cuts, and it works very well, highly recommend!",

I\u2019m one of those lip balm addict types of people lol.If you\u2019re like me- I will say this ointment works wonders on my lips and makes them soft and hydrated in a way that the little tube of Aquaphor lip repair simply can't do. Much less greasy feel, and I don\u2019t have to reapply nearly as often. It also leaves them feeling smooth and leaves the results lasting longer as well, making it well worth the larger size. Definitely would recommend over the tube of Aquaphor lip repair, especially for anyone looking for an actual solution to dry lips as opposed to just a temporary fix.",
