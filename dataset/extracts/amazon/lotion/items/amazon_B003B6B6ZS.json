I bought unscented one, and the product felt heavy and smelt a bit smoky. After using it for 3 months all over my body other than neck and face, I realized this is a very healthy product. It moisturizes really well and lasts for a long time, leaving skin protected, breathable ( no matter how much I accidentally applied on) & not oily. I also use a lot on my feet starting several days ago, and it made my feet's skin soft moist and smooth the same day. I really really love it.",
