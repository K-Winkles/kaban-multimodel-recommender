                "reviewText": "My legs started suffering more and more over the years along the shins to the point of daily discomfort. The itching drove me mad. Good news! I started using this product which saved sanity, my legs, and greatly improved quality of life. Maybe this sounds melodramatic and it is, but it\u2019s worth sharing how much I like the convenience of spraying on the thin non greasy formula in these cans which have become a daily need. It goes on quickly, dries fast, and the scent is heavenly. You can smell cocoa butter but it\u2019s not overwhelming. My legs smell good enough to eat... which is why I\u2019ve begun carrying around a swatter to avoid being mistaken for a bar of delicious chocolate.The cans are so lightweight they seem as if they are made of all plastic which is great if you need to take them with you for vacation and the sprayer has a lock position to prevent accidental pressing. Give this stuff a try and you might love it as much as I do. I also use Vaseline Total Moisture Cocoa Radiant Body Gel Oil for my arms where it\u2019s easier to apply but it\u2019s a heavier feeling product than the spray. It feels good on and works well too. Both are long lasting on. If I could change anything it would be their pricing as it\u2019s a little bit high for what it is. Buying in bulk provides little relief in that regard but I hate to run out.",

My skin does feel moisturized though. My only issue is that one of the cans doesn\u2019t spray. It was the first one I tried and promptly tried the rest of them.It doesn\u2019t make sense to return all 6 because one can doesn\u2019t work, and I\u2019m going to guess that there will be one in the replacement set that won\u2019t work too. It\u2019s disappointing.As for the product review, I like it! It\u2019s not what I expected but I still like it.",
