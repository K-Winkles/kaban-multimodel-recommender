                "reviewText": "I make my own body butters and salves, so I haven\u2019t bought lotion in years, but with all the extra hand washing due to the Coronavirus I wanted something with a pump that I could place by the sink. When I started looking my requirements were: a pump bottle, no icky chemicals and no GMOs. This seemed to be the best match and when I emailed them to verify that their products were GMO free they got back to me in less than 24 hours. The smell is very nice \u2014 not too overpowering or artificial; it actually smells like essential oil and not artificial fragrance. It\u2019s thinner than other lotions I\u2019ve used in the past, but it moisturizes much better. When I use it, it rubs in completely with no greasy residue, but my skin feels softer and well moisturized and that feeling lasts longer than it usually does when I use lotion \u2014 I find that because lotion is made up of so much water, my skin usually feels dry 10 minutes after I\u2019ve put it on. This lotion rubs in very easily and only requires a small amount to moisturize well, so while it is more expensive than some natural lotions, it lasts longer. If you\u2019re looking for a truly natural lotion that makes your skin feel great this is a perfect choice.",

                "reviewText": "My skin is in rough shape. I have very dry, eczema prone skin with patches that tend to break out with occasional acne, scar tissue formation, and rough calluses on elbows and feet. And I got so tired of using multiple skin care products that either barely helped or were way too expensive ($60 face creams, anyone?). So I researched different ingredients, tried out some raw shea butter and coconut oil to see how my skin would react to them, and put quite a few hours into searching for just the right product to meet my needs. This lotion isn't a miracle cream, but with its affordability, pure ingredients, effective moisturizing, and all-over versatility it's pretty close.I purchased the unscented version and it truly is without any scent, good or bad. It comes out thin like a lotion, which made me nervous at first, but goes on silky smooth like the thickest creams, yet without any sort of greasy residue. I've been using it all over (face and body) to the exclusion of any other moisturizing products, just to see what it could do - and I've gone from 6 containers on my countertop to just one, which is pretty amazing. No more dual face creams, body-only lotion, extra moisturizing treatment, cuticle cream, and callus cream! It's gentle enough for sensitive areas like around the eyes, yet effective enough for tough areas like elbows and feet. It hasn't completely reduced my calluses, but it's certainly stopped them from getting worse. My cuticles and skin tone have improved, my acne has almost disappeared, and red eczema-prone patches have evened out. I live in a cold, dry, wintry climate . . . so that's saying something! I love that it's made of the purest and most natural ingredients, and have enjoyed learning more about the benefits of soapberries. I will definitely be buying more of this in the future!",

When you first put it in it feels like it\u2019s going to be greasy but it\u2019s not. Leaves skin smooth and gets rid of dryness.

Not every lotion is gentle enough to use all over, but this one actually is. A huge help when traveling, and generally just reducing clutter, which I love! I'm a firm believer in natural, organic bath and body products. I have used quite a few different brands, including locally handcrafted products from the farmer's market, and I've crafted some of my own.So far this definitely ranks up there in the lotion department! I feel like it performs just as well as my Bare Minerals face cream product, which is amazing, but much pricier. I still love that brand, and will definitely continue using the makeup products, but I think I might switch over to this product for a moisturizer.My daughters are using it for acne and eczema with amazing results. Even overnight we can tell a difference. Feels great, and does not irritate the least bit.So far, it looks like we've found a winner!",

It does moisturize but I have to re-moisturize quicker which means I\u2019m using more product which seems to be my issue with this overall line. The stuff is good and Works but you have to use so much to get there and then the cost isn\u2019t making sense. However I can\u2019t knock the product but I do wish this was more creamy and moisturizing for us. The scent is nice tho",
