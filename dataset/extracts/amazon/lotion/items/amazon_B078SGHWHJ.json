                "reviewText": "This is a good lotion. I generally rub body lotion everywhere immediately after a shower, and as not a small person this takes up a lot of it. Having a giant container of it really helps as the smaller bottles I'd end up using in about a week with two showers a day. The champagne mimosa smell is good, sweet and fragrant but not too overly perfumey. It also seems to moisturize well, isn't just water like some discount large-sized bottles. One morning application has left my skin ash-free all day. The gallon container does not have a pump, however, so plan on putting this into smaller containers if you want to make usage easier. Overall, I recommend highly.",

I did not have high hopes, but I love this stuff. If you have a salon or super dry skin, I highly suggest you check this out. It soaks into the skin, it\u2019s super moisturizing, and does not leave a film. Additionally, it smells great! It is better than any body lotion I\u2019ve tried in a while (Cerve, Hemp\u2019s, Neutrogena, Philosophy, The Body Shop, and First Aid Beauty). It is similar to Olay Nourishing & Hydrating Body Lotion and reminds me of some of my favorite face creams in the way it soaks into the skin: Peter Thomas Roth, It Cosmetics, and way better than any bulk body lotion or there is simply no difference.",

                "reviewText": "I am a licensed esthetician. Despite this, I use the most cost effective products on my own skin because no one has $40 to spend on expensive facial serums. I also have eczema which causes atopic dermatitis on my hands, so washing them so often leaves them dry and painful.After experimenting with different moisturizers, I settled on using Dermasil-branded lotion and had to buy new bottles of it every week. Then I thought to myself, \"Can I find body lotion for cheaper online?\"The answer is yes. I did the math, and the bottle of lotion I was using costed roughly 50% more per oz. So initially, this was the most cost effective solution I could find.I ordered a gallon of lotion from another brand before this one, and I have to say that the Ginger Lily lotion is far better quality. It's thick but doesn't leave a residue on the skin like Dermasil or coconut oil might, and it doesn't sting even in spots where my skin has split from eczema. When I use it, the cracking I tend to get on my heels clears right up, which saves time on having to do foot soaks or exfoliating treatments.If anyone is wondering how the lotion smells, it's fruity with heavy citrus notes. The consistency isn't what I would consider watery, and the fragrance doesn't fade too quickly. I use it in place of perfume.No one at my house purchases their own lotion anymore because they always ask to borrow mine now. This includes my mother who is very particular about fragrance and only used a particular lotion that got discontinued.It is shipped in a standard box with no padding, though I have never received a bottle that leaked or was open. The only downside is that the bottle does not come with a pump, so you'll have to squeeze it into smaller containers or do what I do and just pour it straight from the gallon.This product is my go-to when it comes to purchasing body lotion. If this brand released more fruit fragrances, I would definitely be interested.",

                "reviewText": "Product smells amazing and is light on my face when applied. It is smooth and refreshing. It does not pour into containers with small openings. The consistency of this is like yogurt. Does not flow into containers easily. Careful with where you are wanting it to go! I had to place lotion in a plastic bag and cut the end like I was frosting a cake to get it into my lotion dispenser. Just an FYI",

Great value and I love being able to refill containers versus buying replacements.Regarding the lack of pump, I just drilled a hole into the lid. It is painless to get the lotion into all my dispensers. I wish they had this on subscribe and save. \ud83d\ude22",
