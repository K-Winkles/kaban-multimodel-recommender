With this Aveeno cream, it cleared up the dry skin on my face instantly and I didn't have to use it again for weeks, which is great becuase with the CeraVe I was having to carry it around me all day to classes at Uni when my skin would dry up again. Personally I don't like the greasy feel it can have when you apply it, so only 4 stars for me, though other than that, it does the job very well, which is the main thing.",
