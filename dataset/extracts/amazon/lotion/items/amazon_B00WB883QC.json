I wasn't sure how this would be different, but it is. I'm getting older and my skin dries out much more easily and often. I use it mostly on my face. This soaks in right away and leaves my face feeling softer right away, and it shows. I'll save it for my face and continue to use it, particularly with this warm summer weather !!",
