                "reviewText": "I have a moisturizer that I use regularly (Hempz Age Defying) that I love. My skin is not particularly dry, but it does keep my skin well moisturized, and sinks in perfectly, leaving zero oily residue. Recently I had a laser treatment on my face from my plastic surgeon. He recommended Cetaphil to use afterward, and I thought, I don't need that -- I'm perfectly happy with my regular moisturizer. Well, after a week, I was still applying the Hempz about once an hour and my skin was still extremely dry. So, I bought the Cetaphil. Man, this stuff is incredible! I have to say, it doesn't sink in as well as the Hempz, and does leave an oily feel to the skin for a while after application. But, my skin is SOFT, doesn't hurt anymore, and this stuff lasts for hours! I have super sensitive skin and haven't had any reaction to this at all. It is unscented, which is what I prefer. I probably won't use it on a daily basis after my skin is back to normal, just because I don't like the oily feel. But after a laser treatment, or if I were ever to get a sunburn or anything like that, I would use Cetaphil in a heartbeat. I would also use it if I had naturally dry skin. This stuff is fantastic.",

                "reviewText": "Over the years, I have tried so many body creams, and was never satisfied. Either they didn't moisturize enough, irritated my skin, or were not good economical choices (I put body cream all over my entire body daily, so I use a lot). I used Cetaphil growing up, but after college, I felt the need to use what I felt were higher end body creams.Well, Cetaphil has won over the hundreds of \"high end\" body creams I have used over the years. My dry, sensitive skin loves it. I love that it does not have fragrance, is hypoallergenic, and it also does not clog my pores, so I literally use it from neck to feet. This cream really seals in moisture and protects my skin, especially in the Winter, When I shower the next day, I can feel that it is still on my skin, hence the reason why the skin on my body is so hydrated all the time.Due to the very economical prices, I buy tubs of this product regularly. If I don't have at least two extra tubs on hand, it gives me anxiety because I love this cream so much.",
