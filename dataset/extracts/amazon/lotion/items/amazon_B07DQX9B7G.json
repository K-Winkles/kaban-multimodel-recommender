It is unscented which I like and the texture of my skin has changed-hydrated and softer. I can also feel the differences if I forget to use it.

                "reviewText": "The lotion is a very creamy consistency (not liquid-y) that you apply to wet skin. It takes little effort to smooth it over your wet skin - no need to rub it in all the way! It'll absorb pretty quickly so you can get dressed without worrying about leaving marks on your clothes.I used to apply body lotion in the morning and by the time I changed into shorts at the gym in the afternoon, I'd be so embarrassed by how dry and flaky my skin was. Not anymore. I don't remember where/how/who told me to buy try this lotion but I was hooked day one after seeing and feeling an immediate difference.I've never used a lotion that's left my skin feeling so soft or looking so hydrated. I have a small bottle of the regular Curel lotion that I keep in the car. I swear it takes ten years off the apparent age of my hands because of how moistured and healthy my skin looks afterwards.There are two downsides to this product:1) It's applied to wet skin and in cold weather climates such as where I live, sometimes you just want to dry off and wrap up in a towel. I have tried drying off before applying but it's not nearly as effective so now I just brave those few minutes of cold.2). It does leave a greasy residue that I only notice on my black work desk. While my skin doesn't feel greasy there is usually a mark from each arm where I've rested my elbows on the desk first thing in the morning (~30 minutes after applying). I've never noticed marks on anything else (clothes, sheets, towels) and have experienced this with other types of lotion as well so I don't think it's is limited to this particular one.If you struggle with dry, itchy, flaky skin, or are just searching for a nice body lotion, I highly recommend giving this product a try!",

This lotion really saves the day. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and looking great without the stickiness I hate and the bottle wasn\u2019t broken or open upon arrival. Overall here\u2019s what you need to know:Yes, it works and smells great.Yes, you simply pat yourself off with a towel afterwards.Yes, it\u2019s worth the price.No, it doesn\u2019t completely replace the need for basic lotion or oils. It just saves you from using half a bottle to survive. (I have eczema if it does for you then yippee I guess.)No, it doesn\u2019t file taxes and make breakfast\u2026unless?",

With the others I\u2019ve tried my skin would be dry again by the end of the day. This stuff is amazing and I highly recommend it.",

As soon as I got out of my shower, I IMMEDIATELY applied this \u201clotion\u201d to my body, ALL OVER, especially TO my shoulders, legs & arms. WOW !! My legs, shoulders & arms IMMEDIATELY felt velvety soft. I did NOT even dry off. I sat there and allowed myself to absorb EVERY drop of this \u201clotion\u201d, which, by the way, I prefer to describe this as a \u201ccream\u201d. It is as rich as a \u201ccream\u201d, then, after a few minutes, I dressed. There was ABSOLUTELY no staining on my clothes, which, to my mind, tells you ASAP, that your skin has absorbed it all. It does and it did. The price is very reasonable.I am older, so, my skin needs extra moisture and a \u201clotion\u201d doesn\u2019t do it, but a \u201ccream\u201d on the other hand, does it VERY well. This Curel Hydra Therapy is EXACTLY what my poor dry skin, OBVIOUSLY, did need and I am VERY glad I found this. As I said, the price is very reasonable and THIS is EXACTLY what the doctor ordered. My doctor REALLY did suggest this. MAN !! And, I am SO glad he recommended this. THANK YOU, DOCTOR WALKER & AMAZON !!!",
