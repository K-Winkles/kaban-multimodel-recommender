Thankfully, Baby Oh Baby Unscented Body Lotion does not contain sweet almond oil and does not give me a rash, hives or swelling. I use this lotion year around it on my legs after shaving and on my hands during the dry winter months.This lotion is truly fragrance free; I detest when products adverse as being fragrance free when they actually contain a masking fragrance. The only smell that this lotion has is the natural faint smell of shea butter. I would describe this lotion\u2019s viscosity as more on the thick and creamy side than thin and light which makes it more effective at healing my dry, cracked \u201cwinter\u201d hands.",

It is best to use therapeutic lotion on clean, dry skin preferably after a shower. This lotion is smooth and silky on my skin. It is a medium to thick lotion. I like the natural herbal ingredients that's healthier for your skin. It feels great, and it's non-greasy. It blends very well with my essential oils. I am going to order another bottle soon because I will finish this one in a few weeks with all the aromatherapy products I'm going make. I highly recommend this amazing product.

It's a natural product with a short ingredient list, no harsh chemicals, and it wasn't tested on animals. I trust that the ingredients are not harmful. It works as well or better than any other hand and/or body cream I've ever tried. I used to get it at one of my local supermarkets. I don't know why they stopped selling such an excellent product, but I'm glad I can get it through Amazon.",

My 5 y.o. loves the stuff and she normally shirks any kinds of creams or lotions, I think b/c they have alcohol in them and can sting a child's skin. This may or may not have alcohol, I don't recall, but if it does maybe it is a reasonably low amount.",
