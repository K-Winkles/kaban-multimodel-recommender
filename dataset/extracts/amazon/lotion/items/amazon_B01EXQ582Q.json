I even got the body spray cause i love it so much. Ive been rubbing every night on hips, thighs, and bum bum. It really moisturizes and softens. Absorbs quickly. Ive been doing work outs along with this and gives me a really smooth tight look. I noticed a difference after about 4 days in my skin. The price is worth it for me. The cost is biggest downside.",

I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the original brand lotion. There is no stickiness to the lotion that I\u2019ve noticed. I just mostly love the smell. When applying the lotion after getting out of the shower, it feels so luxurious to lather on and the smell fills my whole bathroom. The smell isn\u2019t overwhelming but it\u2019s there. I just only wished the smell lasted a bit longer. It seems to run out quite quickly and you have to reapply. I love the travel size. If you used it a lot however you\u2019d want to buy the bigger size. This smaller size will not last very long say if used everyday. I love the travel size because it works for what I need. Just buy it! You\u2019ll fall in love like I did.",

No tightening/firming or change in appearance...which is disappointing for a product that costs 3x what my normal product costs for the volume. The product does have a nice silky, whipped feel and smells quite nice. But I find it smells stronger than I really like, so I don't use it before work since I work where strong scents are discouraged.",

I usually do not like smells like vanilla and things like that, but reading the reviews i decided to try a small container. I LOVE the smell of this. It's not overpowering and it isn't one of those smells that 'gets in your throat'. If you know what I mean then you get it (happens to me with smells like vanilla & maple). It is a very soft smell and I love this stuff. When I get close to running out I'm going to order it again. Thank you all for sharing your reviews otherwise I may not have tried this!!!",

Comprei a embalagem mais pequena que deu para cerca de 2 semanas. Nesse espa\u00e7o de tempo fiquei com a pele muito bem hidratada (normalmente n\u00e3o uso qualquer tipo de creme) e sedosa. Penso que o facto de tornar a pele mais lisa (pelo menos \u00e9 a sensa\u00e7\u00e3o que deixa ao toque) faz com que a pele pare\u00e7a (ou fique) mais tonificada e atenue a celulite (n\u00e3o tenho muita, mas parece que ficou melhor depois do creme). Quando este acabou decidi comprar o Sol de Janeiro Beija flor. At\u00e9 que chegasse (cerca de 10 dias de intervalo) n\u00e3o usei qualquer outro creme e mesmo com idas \u00e0 praia todos os dias a pele manteve-se sempre hidratada. Fiquei f\u00e3 da marca (o Beija Flor tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 muito bom), pelo que acho que vale o pre\u00e7o.",
