        "description": "Made with Pure Cocoa Butter and Ultra-Hydrating Lipids, Vaseline Intensive Care Cocoa Radiant body Lotion for dry skin prevents dryness and helps keep your skin looking healthy and hydrated. With daily exposure to environmental triggers (like wind, lack of humidity, and sun), skin's natural moisture barrier can break down, allowing water to escape the skin. But the Ultra-Hydrating lipids in our Cocoa Radiant lotion fortify the skin barrier and replenish moisture to allow the skin's natural barrier to recover. Vaseline Intensive Care Cocoa Radiant Lotion, formulated with Ultra-Hydrating Lipids and Pure Cocoa Butter, moisturizes skin for a long-lasting, radiant glow. This body moisturizer is clinically tested to provide 90% more moisture (vs. untreated skin). This body lotion for dry skin absorbs fast for rich moisturization without the residue and provides 48-hour moisture. Use this dermatologist-tested body lotion daily on dry, rough skin for stronger, noticeably healthier skin. Just apply to your skin for long-lasting moisture. This Vaseline lotion bottle is made of 50% recycled plastic. Our ambition is to get to 100% recycled plastic in the near future. Since 2018, we've used 337 Metric Tons of recycled plastic across the Vaseline product portfolio in North America.",
