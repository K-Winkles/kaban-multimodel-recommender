                "reviewText": "I really was struggling to find a good lotion that was natural with no strong scent to keep my insanely dry skin from getting painful and looking just.. bad. I've struggled with it my whole life. I only found one other lotion that has worked but the scent is very strong and some that don't have more of a refined sense of smell hate it (frankincense and myrrh, the company did not have the same lotion unscented sadly). My skin looks and feels SO much better, as well as my nails. I have been using this on my face as well with no issues. Your mileage may vary but I don't regret buying this one bit. It does have aha and I believe lactic acid, and while it does not say non-comedogenic on it, everything including someone touching me on the face gives me acne and this hasn't, likely due to that.Just be careful with sun exposure due to the added ingredients if not already aware and are not a label reader.",

                "reviewText": "I've recently started trying to switch to more natural products but lotion hasn't been an option till now. From my experience natural body lotions are more liquid than solid and therefore hard to put on. This is not the case with the Alba Very Emollient. This lotion is thick and smells divine. I look forward to using it daily. I've never looked forward to using lotion. The consistency is thick and the smell is a mixture of floral and almond. It goes on easy and is not greasy at all. That's my complaint about many lotions. It's either easy on and doesn't work or it's too thick and greasy. This lotion is just right. I don't think I'll ever buy any other lotion. My skin is soft, no razor bumps, no dry elbows, no ashy skin, just soft and supple like lotion should be. This lotion also has AHA in it which is an anti aging skin smoothing product and so I tried this lotion on my face(I have dry skin) and it didn't break me out, or make me an oil slick. It was gentle enough for the face too!A surprising side effect. I don't know if this is normal but I use this after I shave. The hair is growing back slower and slower since I've started using it. It didn't say anything about this when I bought it. But no joke since I've been using this daily I only have to shave my legs once a week. Then it's barely stubble. I don't know if Alba meant for this product to do that but I love it. I've never loved a side effect before either lol",

It doesn't say unscented but it also doesn't say that there is a scent so beware if you are sensitive to scents like I am. Hard to describe the smell but it's kind of like roses. I've smelled this same (or similar) scent in the regular Olay face cream. I could not find an unscented version of this product so I will use it on my feet so it's covered up and I won't smell it.",
