                "reviewText": "I personally love this brand, so I was excited to see that they had a moisturizer with high enough SPF production to use during the day. Goes on pretty smoothly tho a little bit thick so I used only for my body and not my face. It\u2019s not meant to be waterproof, so would not recommend for beach days, but perfect for every day use during the summer. Would give it 5 stars if it was easier to apply for face without too thick feel.",

Once it\u2019s rubbed in, I can\u2019t even tell I put it on (besides feeling moisturized \u263a\ufe0f). Doesn\u2019t leave a white cast either.It does smell a little like sunscreen, which I don\u2019t love. But the smell doesn\u2019t linger much at all when you put it on so you won\u2019t smell like sunscreen all day!I\u2019ve used the whole tube and am about to order another!",

But it can be a little more clogging when not clean off well be mindful on that but would 10/10 buy again",
