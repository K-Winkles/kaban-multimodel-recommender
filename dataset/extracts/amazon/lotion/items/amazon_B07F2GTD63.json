My arms and legs get so dry that they will usually look dry again an hour after applying body lotion. With Nivea firming lotion with Q10 and Vitamin C, they seem to appear nourished until I shower again the next day. I shower in the evening. I haven't noticed whether or not it's firming my skin because I don't usually look in the full length mirror in the bedroom when I get out of the shower. And I forget to apply it twice a day. But my calves feel firmer. Lol. Most body lotions moisturize my skin for a short time but this actually nourishes it and works longer than all others. I have 4 different firming body lotions in my bathroom but I keep reaching for this one because I no longer itch from dry skin since I began using it. That in itself makes this one a winner in my book.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019d lost 127 lbs and once I figured out what worked for my body the last 75 fell off in a few months ! I worked out diligently throughout the weight loss. But the sagging skin at age 64 was unbearable. I\u2019ve only used this 3 days 2x a day . The difference is unbelievable as I had incredible crepe and a zillion lines around jelly hanging skin on my thighs and Under arms . I planned to take a beforehand pic but this worked to quickly! Also amazing on my super dry rough skin which now feels like silk ! This is what you want ! Also great supplier came fast !",
