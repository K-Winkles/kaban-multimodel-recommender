                "reviewText": "I only started using this lotion as of this week and am already ordering more because I don't want to ever run out! I got Nature brand goat milk soap at the health food store where I live to help me get through some poison ivy (it was on my face!). I really liked the soap and went to Amazon to buy more as I'd bought the only bar at the health food store and they tend to have a random, sporadic inventory. When I searched for the soap I found the lotion and saw how well-reviewed it was. I've always wanted to find a scented lotion that worked well with my skin -- i.e., it's still more about being a moisturizer than being a perfume. And I love the scent of lavender. This lotion is amazing!!! It has a lovely, soft but lasting scent and still fulfills its primary duty as a moisturizer. Whereas I find a lot of scented lotions to be thick and actually drying, this lotion is light and moisturizing. I have sensitive skin and it doesn't seem to be a problem. All of that said, based on how much I usually spend on moisturizer, this is expensive. This is a splurge. For bumming around on the weekends or days when I'm not leaving the house, I'll probably stick to my drugstore brand. But the fact that I'm frugal and am repurchasing this is indicative of how lovely it is -- just a very all-around soothing product that is more luxurious than you'd expect. .",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve always had chronically dry hands during the winter for as long as I can remember, but this time it decided to wait until the end of the season to attack me in a way I\u2019ve never experienced before. My skin was so bad it was cracked and bleeding, and I had to wear gloves even to do the most menial tasks (like rinsing something off, because the water would irritate my skin and dry it out even worse). And I\u2019m a housekeeper, so you can imagine I was wearing gloves 24/7 to protect my overly sensitive skin. Even putting lotion on irritated my hands, and I usually use a very nice olive oil based lotion from Greece which, up until this point, has suited all of my dry skin needs. After a couple weeks of red, itchy, stinging, and bleeding hands, I was fed up. I remembered someone saying that goats milk is a miracle cure for skin problems, so I decided to give some lotion with it a try. I was not disappointed! After a few days of using this, my hands improved tremendously, and after a week, they were cleared up almost entirely! It didn\u2019t irritate hands at all, and if my skin is so smooth after using this. Getting the cuts to heal was another matter entirely, of course, but my dry hands were no longer dry. Even my mom who has terribly dry skin is now using it and is obsessed! It\u2019s a pricey lotion, but if you have severe dry skin, it\u2019s worth every penny. I did see a few reviews with people complaining about the smell? Not sure why? It\u2019s very light, slightly peppery, but it reminds me of my grandmother (not in a bad, old-lady smell sort of way!) and I find it very relaxing. It does linger after using the lotion, too, but it\u2019s not overpowering like some cheap bath and body lotion. Definitely not a bad smell, and definitely not something I would complain about.",

                "reviewText": "I have tried just about every lotion and various oils on the market to combat by excessively dry skin and eczema. In the winter, though, my skin is just horrific. It gets really red and scaly as my eczema flares up. Someone happened to mention that I should try a lotion made out of goats milk. I went to Amazon and found this lotion. Although the scent is not pleasant, it doesn't linger, so it is easy to ignore. Best of all, in just ONE WEEK of using it, my skin is no longer dry and my eczema is gone! It's incredible, so I would DEFINITELY recommend this product if you have either excessively dry skin or eczema. I cannot tell you how many YEARS I've struggled with keeping my skin moist, especially in the winter. This is the first I've come across that actually WORKS.",

                "reviewText": "I like this for after bathing, tried it for the first itme last nite. Light and sinks in. Nice soft scent.My other Canus Nature Goats milk REviews re eye cream, nightly moisturizing cream and facial scrubits only been 3 days but i love this so far. hoping for no breakouts. I have used the Canus Nature goats milk soap bars to bathe for a couple years and LOVE the soft scent and soft skin afterward. I use a cloth on my face (that i clean with the soap and rinse soap off) so I don't think I will be allergic to eye and facial cream and break out. I hope...will follow up. I buy all high end creams and haven't found one i love this could be it and price is great. I purchase the facial scrub and night moisturising cream too. So far they are both awesome. I probably shouldn't try 3 news things on my face at once but all same product base. I love Canus Nature. First discovered on duluth.com but now I buy here. Packagin isnt fancy like some skin creams but i dont want that i want quality skin saving moisturizing creams for aging skin...... quality cream, moisturizing and silky feel all of which this has. I will up date in a couple of weeks to see if i break out. Ago 50, great skin, no blemishes, however very dry and getting lines as i age.4 stars instead of 5 becasue I am not sure if i love this or my balck honey archipelgo lotion better.",

I even use it on my face.The misdelivery is the fault of the postal service, not the seller and I'll complain to the right people.It says that it was left in my mailbox, so there you go. My order was indeed delivered, to my 87 year old elderly neighbor, and I will complain to the proper people at fault.My sweet neighbor left me a message thanking me for the lovely lotion. I wasn't about to tell her that it was a mistake, especially since she had already opened and used the product and under the impression that she just received a gift.",
