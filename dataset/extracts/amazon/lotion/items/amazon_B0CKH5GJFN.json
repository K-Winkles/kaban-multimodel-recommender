                "reviewText": "My husband normally hates lotion because sometimes it doesn't absorb well, smells too feminine, or leaves his skin feeling \"squishy\", especially between fingers. However, he uses his hands a lot for work and they have taken a beating over the years. The skin on his fingers and palms have gotten dry and cracked from all of the physical work he does on a daily basis.The Every Man Jack lotion pumps are masculine and uniquely shaped He really appreciated the pump dispenser instead of a squeeze tube. It's easy to just pump, apply, and go.The consistency is thin and easy to spread over your skin. It is definitely not a super thick lotion which makes it perfect for applying to hands. (doesn't leave them feeling coated and greasy)The fragrance is on the stronger side. If you like the scent of sandalwood, you will probably like this. The sandalwood is VERY prominent! It does have a somewhat woody, masculine vibe going on but I think some women would probably enjoy the fragrance, too. I used it on my legs after shaving just to try it out and didn't care for the fragrance. It was a little too masculine for my personal tastes.It is moisturizing without feeling heavy or sticky as long as you don't apply too much. When I tried it on my hands and only used a little, it absorbed well. When I dispensed too much and applied it to my legs, it took awhile to fully absorb. My legs stayed tacky longer than I would have liked. I used less the next time and I didn't have that problem. So, a little really does go a long way!My husband said that the moisturizing benefits lasted him all day, even when working, sweating, exercising, etc. My legs are on the drier side and the lotion did a good job of keeping them moisturized and itch free throughout the day.",

I've used their body wash before and really liked it and was excited to try this lotion. It's lightweight, absorbs fast, and leaves your skin feeling nourished thanks to natural ingredients like aloe and coconut oil.

Once applied, the smell seems to last at least 12 hours which is very nice. The lotion itself is lightweight, not much more oily compared to Aveeno or Vasoline. That makes it easy to spread on the skin without excess lotion that you have to work hard to rub in. The packaging is convenient too and fits easily in my night stand. Great product overall and shoutout to the non-animal testing label.",

                "reviewText": "I like this lotion because it\u2019s not an overly strong scent, nor does it smell too \u201cmanly\u201d. I ditched chemicals like sulfates, phthalates, and paraben a decade ago so I\u2019m glad to have options like this for my husband. He has been using it daily and seems happy with it. It absorbs quickly and isn\u2019t greasy or sticky at all. We will buy Everyman Jack again!",

                "reviewText": "The lotion works really well so I recommend it but with this caveat, it is not a masculine smell as one reviewer stated, After a few minutes it has like a hint of vanilla smell. Thats ok if you like that smell, I was looking for a woodsy smell. So I have 2 big bottles to use up. The efficacy of the skin softener is good.",

                "reviewText": "This lotion smells a little funky to me? It's also not very hydrating either, but my husband prefers that's since he doesn't like to feel overwhelmingly greasy. He says all my lotions are too thick and this one is a better consistency to him that absorbs better. It is a 2 pack, but one of the pumps came broken and won't pump, so we'll just have to switch the broken one, with the working one when the time comes",

                "reviewText": "Cis men with fragile masculinity can rejoice with this targeted lotion. The ingredients are good, the natural coconut and shea smells accompanied by warm wood scent. If you wear a similar fragrance it can work with it but if you wear something else it may clash. It doesn't project like a good cologne does, you'd have to get close.It's a lighter lotion, a thin but not watery consistency, that absorbs pretty well. A little goes a long way. It can feel greasy if you use too much. It gets rid of ashiness instantly. It's the dry winter season right now, and this is great to counteract that.",
