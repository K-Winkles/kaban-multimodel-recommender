I was wanting a lotion that doesn't conflict with my tanning bed lotion and leave funny smells. Let me just tell you, this one smells amazing! It's super creamy and a little goes a long way. It didn't affect my tan, and I was even able to use it after having a spray tan other than just the tanning bed. Whether you need this to extend a tan, or just everyday lotion, the smell and the creaminess is totally worth the investment!",

She said it was the BEST product she found for repelling the annoying little No-See-Ums biting bugs so I immediately ordered this.I haven't confirmed her claim yet, but I'm very confident she knows what she's talking about.
