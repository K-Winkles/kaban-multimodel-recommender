The cream has proven to be effective in enhancing the overall health and moisture levels of my skin.One of the most noticeable benefits of this skin cream is its ability to provide a deep and lasting hydration to my skin. After regular use, my skin feels noticeably more moisturized, and this added hydration has contributed to a healthier overall complexion. It's reassuring to see a product that lives up to its promise of increasing skin moisture, as dryness can be a common issue for many individuals.Moreover, I've noticed that my skin appears to be more radiant and supple since incorporating this cream into my skincare routine.

It goes on smoothly and is easily absorbed by the skin, which is a relief for those who dislike heavy or greasy products. It doesn't leave any residue or sticky feeling, making it comfortable to wear both during the day and as part of a nighttime routine.Furthermore, it's essential to mention the quality of the ingredients used in this cream. It's clear that the formulation includes ingredients that promote skin health and hydration, which aligns with my skincare goals.In summary, I can confidently say that this skin cream has had a positive impact on my skincare regimen.

                "reviewText": "I must say the majority of the reviews are right with this one. I have been using it for about a week and I definitely feel a difference. I don\u2019t see it so much yet but I definitely feel that my skin is softer and feels more moisturized. I have KP and it has softened that too. I feel like I need to use it longer to get it to go away with steady use. I Will say the bottle is ridiculous. It is more of a butter or cream than a lotion and the bottle makes it very hard to squeeze out the product. Your hands are slippery from using it and is hard to squeeze with one hand. I will need to transfer it to another bottle. Right now, I squeeze with both hands on to the top of my thigh and then scoop it up with my finger (it\u2019s that thick) then put it in the palm of my hand. I do mix it with a little body oil or regular lotion to help smooth it out over my skin a little easier because it\u2019s thick af. You won\u2019t go wrong. I will not be using reg. Lotion alone again! Game changer for real!",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this lotion! It moisturizes well but works even better as an exfoliant. It is fairly strong and you will definitely feel the tingling when you first apply it, though it disappears quickly. The lotion itself is very rich and is more akin to a body butter. It is not scented, although to me it smells just a tad sour-ish, which is expected. I slather it on everywhere, including on my feet. If you have brittle nails, it\u2019s worth looking into the effects of Glycolic Acid on nails too. It\u2019s absolutely fantastic as an exfoliant before or after sunless tanning also. If you have any doubts if it works, just look at the tanned dead skin in the shower after you use it. This also works great if you fudge the tan some too as it will strip the remnant patches. Obviously don\u2019t use this on your skin if you like to extend the life of your sunless tanner. This is also terrific for treating KP. It won\u2019t remove it immediately but you will absolutely see a difference after multiple uses. It\u2019s also great for the skin on your elbows, knees and feet; basically anywhere where you need exfoliation. I have sensitive skin and severe eczema and this lotion does not aggravate either, though, I strongly recommend that you do not put it on eczema spots as it will only promote the inflammatory skin \u201cchange\u201d. This lotion will also help with hyperpigmentation, although, you won\u2019t see the full result until several skin cycles have passed. Anyhow, if you\u2019re on the fence, just pull the trigger and buy it. You will absolutely not regret it.",

Due to the thickness of the lotion even leaving the bottle upside down you can\u2019t get the lotion out. The consumer should not have to work to use the product. Please add a pump that can dispense the lotion.",

New Dr suggested this and IT WORKS!!!!My only complaint is that it is so hard to get out of the bottle. Maybe a pump might help. Then again, the consistency may be too thick for a pump. I just hate asking for another set of hands to squeeze the bottle to get some out. I even tried turning it upside down for 2 days...it didn't slide down to the lid.I guess we're sort of getting a 2 for 1. Lotion that softens the skin AND a workout.\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",
