                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Fixed My Skin Issues Like Nothing Else Could",
                "reviewText": "2-Year Update: Still fantastic. This lotion hardly has a scent (a pleasant one if you really sniff for it), rubs in well so as to not leave skin feeling oily, and has completely resolved my skin dryness issues. I can hardly remember what it was like to have my skin just crack and bleed from being so dry, even after having tried other lotions and healers. Several years in, this is still the best lotion I've found.Original review:I've never been one to use skin lotion, and I'm also rarely happy to put on sunscreen for similar reasons -- I don't like the way my skin feels oily after using it and that it makes everything you touch feel slick, sticky or slippery.However, after living my whole life in the south, I spent a few years farther north, enduring colder, longer and harsher winters than I've ever been through before. In fact, going from a warm, humid (wet) climate to a cold, dry, windy climate really did some damage on my skin, particularly a few different areas on my hands. I tried using some lotion my girlfriend had on it, and it seemed to help, but the redness, dryness and itchiness would only be alleviated for a day or two at most before it would come roaring back.I consulted a doctor who suggested that it might be a fungus (apparently, it can be hard to distinguish between skin irritation and fungus), so I went through a tube of Lotrimin AF trying to treat this. I've also used Neosporin and maybe some other products trying to get my skin to heal. Nothing was working.Even after I moved back down to a warmer climate, my skin irritation lingered. Finally, I read some reviews of this lotion on Amazon. Others had noted similar stories to mine, that they had tried other products, even doctor prescribed medications, on skin issues and nothing had helped until they tried this Jergens Ultra Healing Lotion. I was hopeful that it would work for me, and I'm happy to report that it has.This stuff works wonders, and it doesn't leave me feeling oily afterward. After using this for a few days, my irritation was almost completely gone. For a few weeks, it was still in this state of coming and going, but NOTHING like what it had been before I started using it. My skin had gotten to the point that every few days, my skin would crack and bleed, and bending my fingers or washing my hands would be extremely painful once all these cracks and cuts showed up. Since using this lotion, my skin hasn't come anywhere near this point of irritation. I also ordered some smaller bottles of this so that I could keep some in my car, some at my office, etc., and I could just apply a little any time I started to feel dryness coming on. Now that it has been a few months, I'm hardly even using the lotion anymore and my hands are completely back to normal. Seriously, before, my hands did not look normal -- the redness, the cracking, the cuts, it was awful, and it was far worse on one hand than the other. Now, my hands look exactly the same: completely normal.Every few days, I can feel it starting to come back, but I just apply a little at night and wake up feeling smooth and normal again. This lotion does have a faint scent, but nothing irritating. As I have said, it seems to run in rather quickly and does not leave me feeling like I can't go typing, grabbing the mouse or my phone without leaving that object oily.My girlfriend has abandoned her old lotion. I actually forgot I put this item on subscription and a second, huge bottle came that we didn't really need. However, she simply took that one for herself and put it at her bedside to replace whatever lotion she had been using. She is completely on board with how fabulous this lotion is, and so am I.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Product is good, spreads easily and is great for moisturizing. However, needs better packaging from the seller. I ordered 2 bottles and they came on time. 1 was ok while 1 was defective, as it was squeezed out in the box and the cap was somehow defective and simply spinning and not popping up to be able to pump the lotion out. I bought them so my daughter and I could each have one, but now I will just have to give her both so she can use the pump from the finished one when it's done, to use on the defective one. And I will have to get something else which is such an inconvenience now.It actually costs me to return stuff to amazon because we dont have a direct UPS drop off point so its a waste of time and money to return the product for a replacement.",
