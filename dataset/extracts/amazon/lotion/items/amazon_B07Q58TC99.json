I just got it today, put a tiny dab on the back of my hand, and it\u2019s all I can smell. Even an hour later. :/ I will probably return/exchange for coconut one.",

                "reviewText": "I have tried this company\u2019s body wash at the suggestion of a friend and love it so I picked up the lotion. Great smell, it\u2019s thick but absorbs relatively quickly and lasts a long time. I love it so much I ordered an extra bottle. That should tell you all you need to know. Also, I have sensitive skin and haven\u2019t had any issues with breakouts or rashes while using this. Try it, you will love it. I do wish it was a pump though as the bottle is a pain to squeeze sometimes, due to how thick it is.",
