I love the light scent and it is a nice thick consistency without being greasy! It absorbs into the skin leaving your skin feeling soft and smooth. The only complaint I have is that they should provide a pump to come with it. As others complained about, the lotion is quite thick, so not really pourable. For now, I have another pump from a different product that I'm using for now but it is too short, so not sure what I'll do once the bottle gets to be less than half full. I still think it's worth the money and happy that it is Vegan and Cruelty Free which is top priority for me and my family!",

I like to use a combo of lotion and oil so that it provides maximum moisture for my client's skin and gives me the glide I like. I mix my own oils and was looking for a lotion with some glide, but not too much. If I use the lotion alone it will take a couple minutes to fully soak in. If you are also a massage therapist make a note that you too will need to add oil to get the glide you desire.This lotion soaks into the skin quickly. It has no scent other than just lotion scent. I like to use it to moisturize my hands and arms at the end of a shift so my skin doesn't dry out, especially in the drier winter months.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a licensed massage therapist and thought I'd give this a try. This lotion is great for Myofascial work but not great for Swedish massage. It does leave skin very very soft. You will go through this lotion twice as fast as a gal of biotone or massage fx if you try to use it for Swedish work because it absorbs quickly. You also get a lot of skin balls using this lotion for Swedish. But it's great for Myofascial! Enough lubrication to keep from peeling the skin off but sticky enough to get a great grip on the soft tissue.",

                "reviewText": "I hardly ever write reviews even though I use Amazon religiously but for this product I just had to. At first I was very skeptical about buying this because I usually buy OGX Moroccan argan oil lotion which is impossible to find in stores so I have to order it on Amazon and it's usually $8 or $9 for a 19.5 Oz bottle and while looking on Amazon for that lotion this is the first time I ran across this product as a suggestion. But again i was very skeptical because i have very sensitive skin, like cant even wear any type or brand of makeup sensitive skin because it breaks me out, im even allergic to grass thats how sensitive skin not even exaggerating there and also very dry skin, but I decided to give this a try because it was a huge bottle and had pretty good reviews. And I have to say I can't be more satisfied, it is absolutely amazing lotion. It is the same as the OGX brand lotion I normally buy. Alot of people said in the reviews the scent was strong but to me it wasn't it was perfect because it smells exactly like the OGX brand which is exactly what I wanted because I think it smells amazing. I will definitely be purchasing this again as well as the body wash, shampoo, and conditioner in this size bottle, brand, and scent because I'm absolutely head over boots for it!",

                "reviewText": "This is making my head throb because the perfume smell is so strong. I am not sure what others have found to be \"moisturizing\" or \"good smell\"ing about this product, but not only is the perfume smell very strong, it is a cheap perfume smell at that. Despite what others say, and the description stating \"Nourishes & Hydrates Skin\", this is not the fact. The perfume ie extremely drying and has caused a rash. If you have sensitive skin, save time and money - dont buy this.",

It\u2019s not terrible, but it\u2019s nothing to brag about either. It has a thin, watery feel & while it \u2018does\u2019 moisturize, it\u2019s doesn\u2019t leave my skin feeling as soft and hydrated as I had hoped. I do like that it smells pleasant & isn\u2019t over powering, that in itself is a win!",

I purchased this for my short term rental properties.I was looking for something affordable and to try and reduce waste. I was also searching for a neutral scent. This seems so address all. I have tried it and I am very happy with it. It is not greasy. It absorbs quickly and non sticky. The scent is not overpowering and it is fairly neutral, meaning it is not feminine or masculine. I would describe the scent as a clean scent, not floral. I would highly recommend this product. I would recommend buying a pump to refill your bottles. It is thick and you can\u2019t just pour it out. I have also ordered the entire line (shampoo,conditioner, and body wash. I will review those separately) Again this is for my short term rentals. I wanted everything to have the same scent.",
