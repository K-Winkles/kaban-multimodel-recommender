And I can definitely say that if you apply it liberally on all your skin, that is an accurate statement (at least for me). Mosquitoes usually bite me like crazy and when I wear this, I don't get hardly any and many times none at all. If they do bite, it's usually on the spots I didn't get applied well. The lotion is also moisturizing and easy to spread. It doesn't feel greasy. This particular scent is ok, but I'm not a big fan of it overall so will probably choose a different one next time. Love the product overall though.",
