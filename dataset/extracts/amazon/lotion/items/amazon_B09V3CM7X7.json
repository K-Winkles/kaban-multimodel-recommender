The product is significantly thinner than the majority of currently available body lotions and has on average 2X the amount of oil. Our high-oil formula is infused with Shea Oil, Rosehip Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, and Vitamins E & A. This unique combination of being ultralight yet high in oil is made possible by Bio-Oil\u2019s pioneering \u2018shake before use\u2019 formulation. Bio-Oil Body Lotion has been formulated to hydrate and replenish mild everyday dry skin, helping to maintain the skin\u2019s natural moisture balance. It supplements the skin\u2019s natural oils which can be stripped away by factors such as extreme weather, water with high chemical content, frequent bathing and the drying effects of central heating and air conditioning. It helps lock in moisture and reduces the rate at which water vapour is naturally lost through the skin\u2019s surface. This product is non-comedogenic, safe for oily skin, acne prone skin, and sensitive skin.",

                "reviewText": "I have been very dehydrated lately and my skin was very dry to the point of itching after every shower and having patches of visible dry flaky skin. I was basically looking for anything that was in my price range and could get here soon because I was tired of itching and feeling this tight dry skin all the time. I bought this product and as soon as it went on my skin I literally felt like my skin was saying thank you for all this nourishment and all this moisture. My skin felt amazing and now that I've been using it for four or five days my skin has no more dry patchiness it stopped itching and it feels really nice now and smooth and soft. I would highly recommend to anyone with dry skin. It is unscented so that makes it very non-gender specific so if you're a woman or a man you can buy this and put this on without feeling like oh I'm going to smell floral or I'm going to smell musky. But honestly I would definitely give this a try for anyone who's having dry skin problems because it's really nice it goes on very nice it doesn't feel sticky or goopy because it dries really quickly and it's so nice and I have itchy flaky skin.",

The texture is not a thick cream like traditional lotions, but more of a loose, watery lotion. It\u2019s a milk white color. Isn\u2019t oily but feels like a silky, watery lotion that immediately absorbs into the skin. Great product for wintertime or for anyone with dry skin in general. Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Writing this review on my husband\u2019s account. This lotion was great for itchy skin during pregnancy. It worked better than prescription topicals from my doctor. A little goes a long way. It\u2019s a thin oil like consistency but doesn\u2019t leave your skin greasy and the moisture lasts all through the day. It\u2019s unscented which is a bonus and my sensitive skin is very happy.I love this lotion, hate the bottle/packaging. It doesn\u2019t come with plastic wrap or a safety seal; there\u2019s a risk that the bottle could leak during transit or someone could tamper with it without you knowing. Also, because this lotion is so runny, it\u2019s impossible to pour it in your hands without residual product running down the side of the bottle after. I wipe the bottle down each use but also store it in a separate tub so it doesn\u2019t damage my cabinet. I plan to get a pump bottle instead to prevent this for future orders.",

                "reviewText": "I use Bio-oil and love everything about the product, so I decided to try the lotion. Yes, at first I thought it was too watery, and it didn't look or smell anything like the oil. But, please know that this is a genuine product, and not watered down nor fake, like some disappointed people here have sorely reviewed!! This is a lotion, and the oil is an oil...simply two completely different products made by the same company. So, as far as Bio-lotion is concerned, and apart from juding it against Bio-oil, I do like the way it goes on my skin, it definitely works well, and it has a clean smell, meaning no scent at all. I actually think this is a great lotion to use when you don't want greasy residue on your clothes...and especially if you are scent-sensitive, or maybe you just want to smell like yourself and not a walking lavender bush:)lol",

It's like you're putting on body oil. It leaves your skin super oily, takes a LONG time to dry, if at all, I think doesn't just come off when you put on clothes. After it had \u201cabsorbed\u201d, I made a mark on the skin to see if the skin was still dry, and to my surprise the skin was completely dry. It doesn't have any smell. But if you are looking for a body oil, better go with the original version of their oil which dries faster and smells good.",

I read tons of reviews prior to ordering, which kind of had me on the fence about purchasing but I\u2019m SO GLAD I decided to anyway! This is my favorite moisturizer!Pros-A little goes a long way! It comes out in an oily/milky-like content that spreads very easily. It has hardly little to no scent, but it\u2019s still very refreshing. My skin feels like it\u2019s glowing since I\u2019ve used this. I also do not feel like it immediately transfers to my clothing once applying, nor is it sticky at all.Cons-The bottle.I read many, many people talking about this before I ordered so here\u2019s my opinion:Yes, it could have a better dispenser but it\u2019s not a make or break deal. I simply put my hand close to where I dispense, and just catch any extra product that may leak out (this hardly ever happens & even when it did \u2014 it was little to none).I honestly have no other cons whatsoever \u2014 I love this!I would not put this on my face. I know it says body, but I still read some people talking about applying to their face. It is an oily product so I personally believe it would break your face out if you have sensitive skin like myself.Hope this helps anyone looking for a great moisturizer! \ud83c\udf89",
