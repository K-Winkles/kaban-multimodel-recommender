Luckily, most of their product line is available on Amazon and the pricing is a bounus.The thing about skin care products is that everyone has their own preference... and that can vary a lot. For me, I like the way this lotion feels on my skin because it's not as heavy as others I've tried. I always keep coming back to St. Ives products. In addition to the lotion (which comes in many scents) they make a variety of shower exfoliating body wash products.All in all this product protects and soothes without over doing it. Try it St. Ives products and you'll be satisfied with the results!",
