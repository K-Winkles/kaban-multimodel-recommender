Whether it's my hands or body, it does a great job of keeping my skin well-hydrated.While I appreciate the lotion's subtle, neutral scent, it's not overly fragrant. This is a big positive for me as I can use it in professional settings without worrying about an overwhelming fragrance.The only reason I didn't give it a full five stars is because it is a bit on the pricier side compared to some other options",
