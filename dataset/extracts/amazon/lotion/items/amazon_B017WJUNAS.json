The Vaseline brand was built on the healing efficacy of Vaseline Jelly. Formulated in 1870, this \u201cWonder Jelly\u201d has been healing dry skin for over 150 years. Today, what started with a jar of Vaseline Healing Jelly has grown into an expansive product portfolio that includes Vaseline Intensive Care Lotions and Vaseline Lip Therapy tins. However, The Healing Power of Vaseline Jelly can still be found inside the products that Vaseline makes. We invite you to go back in time and learn the origins of the Vaseline brand, and how after a century of healing it became one of the celebrated skin care brands around the world.",
