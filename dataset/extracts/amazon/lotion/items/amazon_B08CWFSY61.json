No other lotion keeps me as moisturized as Alba Emollient. I usually use the Original Scent. The smell reminds me of stale hard candy lol! At first it was off putting but I stuck with it because it worked better than any other lotion Ive tried. Im glad I did because now I actually prefer the Original scent to the Unscented. The scent is light enough that it goes away fairly quickly and I am able to use my scented lotions over it. I just recently tried the Maximum lotion and it also works great! It can be a little thick to apply so I just add a little bit of filtered water to the bottle and shake it up if I need to thin it out. This lotion has all but cured my eczema, as long as I apply it after every shower, and I don't have to feel guilty about the amount of lotion I'm putting into my body because of all of the great ingredients! I hope it never changes!I received my product in great timing and customer service is great. I would definitely buy from this seller again.",

                "reviewText": "I love that I can subscribe and save to get this product regularly. I live in a country where I can\u2019t find it anywhere. I have tried the coconut, the maximum, and now this one the original and I think it\u2019s my favorite one! It has a little bit of a thicker consistency then regular lotion and even though it\u2019s unscented, it still has a slight \u201cclean\u201d smell to it. I use it everyday on my entire body, it\u2019s the only lotion I will use! My only issue was the pump came undone during shipping and lotion escaped, which I can\u2019t really complain about it did make it overseas, but maybe just a strip of packing tape put tightly over the pump to prevent the pump from coming up might help that. All in all great product highly recommend so thankful it ships here!",

                "reviewText": "This is my new favorite moisturizer. The soothing chamomile, aloe, and green tea is great for my irritable, itchy skin. The moisture fees luxurious and I would definitely recommend it for dry skin. It stays all day and treats even my rough patches rather quickly. My skin feels and looks great. Some say \"greasy\" finish, but I'd say \"silky.\" And honestly, I've never had a moisturizer worth a darn that didn't have that finish. This lotion means business. The scent is delectable- chamomile and jojoba, but with a little freshness to it from the aloe. Not overwhelming, just clean.Finally, the pump bottle is SO convenient and it's paraben/pthalate free. I'll definitely keep buying this lotion.",

                "reviewText": "Happy to get them in a large size for a really good price because I use them every day, head to toe, even as a night time facial moisturizer. For me, there is no reason to get additional creams and potions. I am in my 60's and the weight and moisturizing properties are just right for a hydrated feel without any promises of miraculous ingredients. I get the two original formulas and one is supposed to be extra moisturizing, but they seem fairly similar. The scent is \"lotion\" scent, not off-putting or strong. It is slightly sweet where I might want more of a forrest smell, but that's just me and it is not going to get in the way of my ordering another bottle. P.S. I work outside in all weather and have never had an adverse sun-related reaction.",
