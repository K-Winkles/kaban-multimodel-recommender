Smells great and leaves you feeling moisturized, slightly greasy, but that leaves a nice shine on the skin and it still absorbs really well. Thicker texture which assures you it is not a watered down lotion product, great for the colder weather and a good night's sleep. I absolutely love this old school lotion!",

                "reviewText": "I couldn't be happier with my experience using Keri lotion! From the moment I opened the bottle, I was impressed with the creamy and smooth texture of the lotion. It doesn't leave any greasy residue or stickiness behind, which is a huge plus for me.One thing I really appreciate about this lotion is the light scent. It's not overpowering, so I can easily layer it with other scents I enjoy without feeling like I'm overdoing it.I first started using Keri lotion when my best friend's grandmother gave me a bottle as a gift, and now I can't imagine using anything else. My skin feels softer and more hydrated than ever before.Overall, I highly recommend Keri lotion to anyone looking for a nourishing and non-greasy lotion. It's a fantastic product that does exactly what it promises, and I look forward to continuing to use it for years to come.",
