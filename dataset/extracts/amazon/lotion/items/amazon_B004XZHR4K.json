With in a week my feet were felt soft and the skin was not dried out and the cracks were almost completely healed. I was so amazed by how fast my recovery time was that I purchased three 12 ounce bottles from Amazon. It is hard to find in the pharmacy and stores because it sells out fast. I recommend to anyone that suffers from dry skin or cracks in your heels to purchase this product. I also was empresses by the other body was soaps that Aveeno has. Aveeno this is the only skin lotion and body soap I use now. Never knew there was a difference in bath and body lotion\u2019s until I started using Aveeno. Get some you will feel the effects right away .",

It works great, but not as good as the stress relief Aveeno, which is thicker. Smells great and has okay texture. Would be better if it was a little thicker like the stress relief Aveeno, hence the 4 stars instead of 5.",
