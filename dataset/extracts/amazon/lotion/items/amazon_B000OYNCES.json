It's earth and gentle. This lotion saved my skin in ways words can't justify. It's been consistently good for bottles of use, and is the only lotion I've used for the better part of 2 years. Dry Canadian winters don't stand a chance. I use it on my entire body after showers and I don't get dried out and itchy. It soaks in quickly that by the time I'm done moisturizing, I can get dressed and carry on with my day.",

                "reviewText": "I find that there's sort of good news and bad news with this lotion... the good news is that it feels incredible; it soaks in immediately & isn't greasy in the least and it doesn't need to be applied often (although I have been on my hands because I wash them so often & my house is *really* dry in the winter).The bad news (for me at least) is the scent. Before I ordered it I asked if it smelled the same as the original (I LOVE the scent of the original); two people said it did & two people said it didn't, one of whom said it smells exactly like the Body Shop's White Musk. I ordered it hoping that the first two were right but it turns out that it really does smell like White Musk. I used to wear that perfume years and years ago so I do like it but I was really hoping for the original scent.The only reason I bought this one is that there was no single bottle of the original, it was only available in a 2-pack, which I think I'll end up ordering anyway once I put a significant dent in this one.It arrived in 3 days and was really reasonably priced, so other than the scent I really have no complaints :).*Edit: After about a week of using this I'm pretty much over the scent because my skin has never been softer. The difference after only a week is huge, night & day -- I really can't recommend this highly enough.",
