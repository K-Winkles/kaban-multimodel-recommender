Plus, the formula is non-greasy (no, really!) and very hydrating. My skin doesn\u2019t feel tacky for hours after application like a lot of other brands. I liked it so much I bought the big bottle and it\u2019s the only brand of lotion I will consistently apply at night and with pleasure.",

So I generally always have to buy scent free products.After buying my partner Hempz\u2019 hard working face cream, I tried it and loved it. I wanted something for my body and this stuff didn\u2019t list a smell in the description so I bought it. It does have a smell... but it Smells fantastic and doesn\u2019t give me a headache!Makes my skin feel amazing. I bought the big pump bottle for at home to apply when in bed and then I bought the mini bottle for when I\u2019m at work! I wish I were rich because I would totally stockpile on it. I pray that they never discontinue this product",
