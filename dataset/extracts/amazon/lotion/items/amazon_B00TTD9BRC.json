                "reviewText": "This southern gal has struggled badly with dry skin since I had to move to a much colder climate, especially during the colder months! I get dry flaky skin on my hands and my legs especially; on my legs it is so bad that sometimes I cannot help scratching until it bleeds, or leaves a rash. I even do it in my sleep. It is... not my favorite thing.This product specifically - the moisturizing cream - is a lifesaver for me. Since using it, I no longer have the above issues with my skin. It does not smell like anything, is not at all greasy (my fave thing about it!!), feels thick while going on light and smooth, and ACTUALLY moisturizes. It's not meant for scent or cosmetic purposes. It truly leaves me with a deep moisturize that puts my dry, inflamed skin to rest. it is the only product I can swear by using for moisturizing my body. I have not used it much on my face, but I believe it is light and clean enough to do so :)Even better, my skin is sensitive to shaving and I sometimes get razor burn. If I apply this immediately after my shower, I do not get razor burn, and no uncomfortable itchy or burning sensations!Highly recommend for dry skin girlies especially during the cold months.",

I am 50, and have always had sensitive skin that dries out and flakes in the winter months. My fingers crack in the cold as well.This cream isn\u2019t greasy, absorbs very well, goes great under makeup, and has caused no adverse reactions whatsoever, and I use it on my face, neck and under eye area every morning and night after washing my face with Alaffia black soap and using Thayer\u2019s alcohol free toner. It also works well on my hands and body but I have always had more difficulty finding a facial product that works sans any negative side effects. Furthermore, my husband, who has a LOT of allergies and product sensitivities, and struggles with finding good personal care products has also used it successfully on his face.Nothing but satisfaction from me!",

Goes on easy, remaining residue on hands can be rubbed in and you can start touching stuff right away. Not much of a scent to it, so that is a plus for me.The shipping for this was bad. It was loose in the shipping box with other things. The container itself has no seal, so I'm just assuming it was the same inside as it was in the factory and nothing was put in there in transit. The lid came off at the slightest touch when picking it up from the box. Luckily this stuff isn't liquid, so nothing spilled out into the rest of the box. The cream itself seems normal and the same as it was when purchased at a retail store.",

The best qualities for me, aside from it actually softening my hands and arms, is how nontoxic it is. Unlike many other brands, I don\u2019t end up with itchy sweaty hands after applying this. It absorbs wonderfully and I don\u2019t have the need to wash my palms due to feeling oily. Instead with this cream they are just left feeling soft.

Dopo diversi mesi posso assicurare che funziona molto meglio di tante altre marche (che non mi hanno dato sollievo).La consistenza \u00e8 molto piacevole, morbida e vellutata, molto piacevole al tatto, si spalma con facilit\u00e0 e non lascia le mani eccessivamente unte. Ha ingredienti di qualit\u00e0, non tossici e non ha praticamente odore, cosa molto importante per chi come me ha un olfatto sviluppato o preferisce mantenere il profumo di altri prodotti usati nella routine.La migliore sul mercato? Non azzarderei, ma il prezzo \u00e8 decisamente migliore rispetto ad altre marche pi\u00f9 note e costose (\u00e8 comunque un prodotto L'Or\u00e9al, quindi alta qualit\u00e0)Questa versione da 539g pu\u00f2 risultare comoda per chi ne usa molta tutti i giorni, tuttavia il prezzo per grammo \u00e8 pi\u00f9 alto rispetto alle altre confezioni. Consiglio di scegliere le versioni pi\u00f9 piccole se vogliamo risparmiare qualcosina o se dobbiamo portarla in viaggio.",
