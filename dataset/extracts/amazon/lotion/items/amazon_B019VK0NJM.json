                "reviewText": "I struggle with obsessive repeated handwashing due to OCD so my hands have started to bleed and crack; especially so during the winter. I recieved the product only four days ago and my hands feel brand new already! They're small enough for me to have them kept near sinks, in my bag, car and etc. so that I can always reapply it when necessary.The only problem is that after applying the lotion feels quite oily/greasy, and has left some oily residue on my desk. After letting your hands dry for five minutes or so this isn't a problem, but the residue does not go away without cleaning if you touch anything before it dries. The consistency is also slightly runny and can sometimes vary from bottle to bottle.Overall very good lotion that I recommend! My hands went from scaley, dry and cracked to smooth in less than a week.",
