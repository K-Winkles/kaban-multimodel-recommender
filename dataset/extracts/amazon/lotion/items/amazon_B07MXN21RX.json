Uradin Lotion 10 has been tested and proven to be highly effective for body use. If you are looking for a face moisturizer we recommend Age Contour which is suitable for a wide range of skin types. Can I apply Uradin Lotion 10 on wet skin? Uradin Lotion 10 can be applied on damp skin, for example after showering or taking a bath and drying off slightly. This can help your skin to absorb the emollients and allows the lotion to spread easily.",

So far I\u2019ve had no issues with dryness this winter and I used it on my heals every day for a week and I now have smooth, soft heals for the first time since leaving my mother\u2019s womb. It does have perfume in it but it\u2019s a very mild scent. It kinda smells like public bathroom hand soap, but it goes away quickly and I kinda like it because it reminds me of the bar soap my whole family used to use in the 90s.",

(No cakey/mask/suffocating feeling) My skin is no longer dry feeling or has the dry appearance. Dermatologist told me a little of this lotion goes a long way, and she was right! Also, I'm hyper-sensitive to scents and this product barely has a scent during application that is a mild neutral that absorbs in so well (and quickly) ... you would have to literally put your nose on your skin and take a big sniff to detect a scent (once it's has soaked in). Very pleased with this product. Yes, it costs more than regular big box or store brands, but it lasts longer if used as directed/getting your money's worth and without an odor that competes with your perfume, or your natural clean scent. I prefer to apply product directly after a shower for all over, and following washing hands thru out the day.",

I'm in my mid 70s and have developed extremely dry skin due to age. My back was actually peeling it was so dry. Just a few weeks after I started using it my skin was noticeably improved and continued use has just made it better. This will be my cream from now on. It does have a mild scent, but it is not offensive, to me it is just a fresh, clean odor...like soap. Worth every penny. I definitely can recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I recently started using the this skin care cream. I had been experiencing itchiness and moisture cracks in my shin and calf areas for a while, but after using this cream, all of those problems have disappeared.The cream is very moisturizing and has a pleasant scent. It absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn't leave a greasy residue.After using this cream for just a few days, I noticed a significant improvement in the condition of my skin. The itchiness and moisture cracks were gone, and my skin felt soft and smooth.Overall, I highly recommend the ISDIN skin care cream to anyone who is looking for an effective and solution for dry, itchy skin. It has worked wonders for me and I'm sure it will do the same for others.",
