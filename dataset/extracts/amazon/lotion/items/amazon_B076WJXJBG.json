                "reviewText": "\"Eczema Soothing Relief Cream\"---finally, a product that does exactly what the name says it does!This is a long but thorough review that I hope may be helpful to fellow eczema sufferers:I have eczema flares on my hands which always get worse in the winter. I've been struggling to find a product that will relieve the itch and the scaly patches without making my hands slippery and greasy. I've applied this product only twice since I received it, but based on my extensive experience with other eczema products, this one is a winner! It has a great texture and soaks in quickly, but best if all it relieves the itch very shortly after I apply it. The red scaly patches on my hands are already disappearing and my skin is left soft as a baby's cheeks!It is fragrance free, but does have a very very faint petroleum-like smell after it is applied to the skin, but dissipates quickly.This is just something I observed that's not a big deal to me, but may be something to consider for someone else wanting to try this product.I would definitely recommend this product, as it is effective AND affordable, and as a bonus, it is FSA/HSA eligible!",

                "reviewText": "I gave La Roche-Posay's eczema cream a shot for my eczema flare-ups, and here's the real deal: it's great for moisturizing but didn't quite hit the mark for my flare-ups. It kept my skin feeling soft and hydrated, sure, but when it came to the main event - tackling those pesky flare-ups on my face - it just didn't stand up to the task. I had to switch back to my trusty cortisone, which honestly did a way better job.I ended up using this cream more as a general body moisturizer. It's okay for that, but if you're looking for something to combat serious flare-ups, this might not be your hero product.And about the tube - it's kind of a pain to squeeze out the last bits of the cream. It's like you know there's more in there, but good luck getting it out! A little redesign could go a long way in making sure you can use up every last drop.Overall, it's a decent moisturizer, but for those tough eczema moments, you might want to keep looking. And a little tweak in the tube design wouldn't hurt, either!",

Light pleasant scent.Feels \"luxurious\", which might sound weird to describe a lotion, but other lotions often feel goopy and cheap.This is the most expensive lotion in the category that I saw but I am totally happy with the overall value. I also liked the one by Aveeno, but that one had a little stickier feel. I will likely buy this one again as it has been the most effective for my eczema.The marketing for this company is questionable (they exagerate too much), but the science seems spot on. This was not even recommended to me by my dermatologist, and considering the expensive city he is in (Newport Beach, CA) he would likely not have a problem recommending something expensive. He gave me a bunch of samples of other lotions, they were decent overall at best, the one by Aveeno was the one that left the softest skin and smelled best. But i found this one on my own and happy with it.",
