I don't know what the old formulation that people are reviewing was like but this product is pretty thick, but not so thick that you can't get it out of the bottle. I store my bottle upside down so that I don't have to squeeze it and that helps. When I get to towards the end of the bottle, I supposed I can let the bottle sit upside down in a warm water bath and I think that should do the trick. As far as the scent, it is really, really nice. I wear scented oils and I feel like this product's scent is strong enough that I don't need any additional scented oils; at least for a few hours. The lotion is fragrant but doesn't last as long as an oil would though. I would definitely order it again.",

                "reviewText": "So I squeezed the contents into another container and that works for me. Plus other ppl can smell the scented lotion. But unfortunately I cannot after application adding essential oils helps with moisture \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-This squeeze bottle is too difficult to get the product extracted. It takes me two hands to squeeze the lotion out. And sometimes it clogs. Have to remove cap.Moisture? Maybe adding my own coconut essential oil gives my skin moisture but this shea butter lotion ain\u2019t it!The scent on the soap is why I purchased the lotion. Nope! Not the same strength in scent. Very mild. Therefore money paid wasn\u2019t worth the value.",

                "reviewText": "This lotion is so moiturizing! It does have a strong Shea butter scent to it which I don\u2019t mind as it smells lovely. However if you\u2019re going for unscented, this is not it. I have to keep the bottle on it\u2019s side in order to quickly get product out when I squeeze because it\u2019s more creamy than lotiony. I wish the bottle was designed with the lid as the base to ease product let down. Everything else though I love! It keeps my skin moisturized alll day long! Love it! I will be using this especially in the winter months. With the weather getting so hot now though I\u2019m going to look for a lighter lotion hopefully as moisturizing as this one!",

That's my only complaint. I've noticed on reviews, people are seeing some weird color on the top of the bottle and the product is perfectly fine! I put mine in a glass jar and have noticed the oxidization of the shea. Do not fret! This is normal for a CLEAN product to turn a little. There's nothing wrong with it!",

Within theb2 pack of lotion one of the bottles had MOLD inside of the bottle. It was visible through the bottle and then was all throughout the bottle. Very disappointed that this was sent out and sold.Normally this lotion is and has been great for my skin. Smells great and has helped to relief redness while keeping me moisturized.Would like a replacement sent!",
