Yes, you may have noticed that we have updated our packaging to showcase our new & improved formula with Pro-Ceramide. This exciting change reflects our commitment to delivering high-quality products. You may receive either design. Did Lubriderm change their formulas? Yes, Lubriderm has made some exciting changes to enhance our products! We have improved our formulas including the addition of Pro-Ceramide, but don\u2019t worry-our lotions are still fast-absorbing with a clean, non-greasy feel. What is Pro-Ceramide and why is it important? Pro-Ceramide has been shown to penetrate within skin\u2019s surface layers and help support your skin\u2019s natural Ceramide levels. Ceramides play a role in helping maintain a healthy moisture barrier which helps retain moisture within your skin\u2019s surface. Is Lubriderm lotion safe for use on tattoos? Experts recommend using a water-based lotion to hydrate tattooed skin. Lubriderm Daily Moisture Lotion Fragrance Free is a gentle, water-based, unscented lotion that quickly absorbs and moisturizes for healthy-looking skin. Which Lubriderm lotion is best for winter skin? Dry, winter air coupled with heat indoors can lead to very dry skin. Intensely moisturizing products such as Lubriderm Advanced Therapy Moisturizing Cream Fragrance-Free replenish extra dry skin and help to restore your skin's moisture barrier.",

Used Lubriderm years ago and, frankly, had completely forgotten about it. Well, this was a pleasant surprise! Absolutely no scent!!! This lotion with the pump top comes out thick like Greek yogurt. A little dab the size of a pea is enough for both hands and it is wonderful. Not sticky nor slippery, either. Goes on smooth and works into skin to leave hands or the rest of body silky soft. 16 ounces is a great value, too. My husband loves it because it has no scent and smooths his rough hands.",
