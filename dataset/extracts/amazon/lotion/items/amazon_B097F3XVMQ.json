I then bought several different brands to find one that worked for me, and this was very similar to the old Suave. It rubs in nicely to my skin, minimal scent, leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. The only thing I don't like about it is the pump. I wish they sold it in this size with just a squeeze top. I bought a few of the 8 oz. size with the squeeze top, and pump the lotion form the bigger container into my smaller containers for easier use.",
