                "reviewText": "A gallon of lotion! I wanted this lotion for my super dry skin and also for my husband's very dry hands. I wasn't sure what to expect but I am pleasantly surprised. The lotion is quite thick. I thought it would be watery but it isn't at all. It is creamy and hydrating. There is no scent so my husband feels more comfortable using it than my scented lotions. I wish it came with a pump top so we could pump some out whenever we needed it. I bought some pump bottles though and am filling those so I will have a bottle in almost every room of the house and in my RV to keep my skin hydrated.Its simple but effective moisturizing lotion. It lasts for around six hours before my skin starts to feel dry again. I use a thick body butter after a shower and this lotion as often as I can between to keep my skin plumped and hydrated. I tried it on my face and it works great! No scent, no stickiness, and it hydrated nicely. I wouldn't use it as my daily facial moisturizer but it's quite effective. I removed a star because it doesn't last quite as long as I would like on my skin and I wish it came with a pump top but, in all, this is a great buy and will last for ages!",

                "reviewText": "I have tried dozens of supposedly fragrance free lotions. This is by far the best. No scent, no smell at all. Rich, creamy texture that absorbs just right. Skin stays soft a long time. Does not seem to me a massage lotion because it is nicely thick. Not too thick, but luxuriously so. And a great value. I just hope it is as free of bad ingredients as it claims. Very happy with this lotion.",
