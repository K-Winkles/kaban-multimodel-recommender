                "reviewText": "This works well if you have really dry skin. Most moisturizers on the market are just so full of fillers that there is little if anything in them to benefit the skin. This actually has useful ingredients! It actually helps smooth dry skin and make it normal again. I like the pump bottle. It works well until you get down to the last 1/3 to 1/4 of the bottle. Then you just cannot get it to pump out anymore. I cut the bottle apart and put what is left in another container. It might be better to sell this product in a jar. It really is more of a cream than a lotion.",
