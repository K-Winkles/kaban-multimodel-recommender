I use the lotion mostly on my upper arms where I do tend to have a little bit of bumpy skin and it takes care of it immediately.If you are using this for the first time put it on in the evening and give it overnight and you will have smooth skin in the morning.I can only highly recommend this and will be purchasing this again, just wish it came in a larger size.

First, this lotion is truly unscented. A little goes a long way; using too much will leave a slightly sticky residue. I took off one star just because of the feeling of it on the skin, but it absorbs okay and isn't too bad. I have noticed an improvement in my skin and have been using this for around a month. The bottle seems small, but it actually lasts a long time.Here is my routine:For the first week, apply both morning and night.Starting the second week, apply in the morning, then use a heavier moisturizer at night (I like Hemps lotion).Once or twice a week, exfoliate with First Aide Beauty KP Bump Eraser scrub.Consistency is key here. But all of these products are decently affordable and last a long time. Hope this helps someone!",

                "reviewText": "Story time!! I'm 30 years old and I've always had dry skin, prone to stretch marks, slight translucent, and occasional karatosis Pilaris (red, hard bumps, looks like mild acne on arms, chest, back, and butt, leg's) . As a teen I never wore shorts because it was embarrassing not to have soft legs. They didn't look bad, they just were kinda matte even with lotion. Recently I bought Cerave body wash and lotion at the store. My skin looked better, felt better, was so soft and normal. My bumps are gone. After a few glasses of wine I got on Amazon and ordered a bunch of Cerave products to try them out. I got the bar soap, face wash, bumpy skin lotion, bumpy body wash, the dark blue container for extremely dry skin, the pump jar, the day and night cream, and the vitamin C serum. Sober me was happy to see all of these products today. I took a shower and tried different ones and I love them all!!!! No after shower itchy skin from hot water, everything is so soft, no itching or burning from these products. Honestly I've bought so much stuff to help me. Even Aveeno gave me dry skin. Lotion, oil, vaseline, homemade natural stuff whipped up in my kitchen, nothing worked. Just from what I got at the store my skin looked like everyone else's, but tonight it has that extra soft shine without being greasy. Products just soaked right in and my skin feel's comfortable. Some products go better on damp skin. The moisturizing face wash is great but I used it after using the bar soap to remove makeup. The moisturizing face wash doesn't foam up, so sometimes you'll need something extra, but it is super moisturizing. The bar soap is great you have to really work up a lather at first but it's so gentle, and moisturizing. I used it everywhere and when I got out of the shower I wasn't dry and itchy, and this is before lotioning!! Night cream over vita C serum feels so good, not greasy vita C serum is thin, night cream is not heavy, soaked in quick face is so soft. Hang tried the day cream yet, but will tomorrow. Go to the drug store and buy a small lotion, if you like it then I highly suggest trying other thing's, maybe before drinking a half bottle of Moscato. Since I bought so much stuff I'm posting the same comment on the other things I bought.",

I really dont know how this cream is supposed to work, but I'll monitor use over next month, and will see if any improvements appear. I do hope it works though as my skin is a mess right now",
