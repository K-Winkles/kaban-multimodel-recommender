                "reviewText": "I was excited to try this lotion. I usually like lavender scents and it's vegan which is a must for me. It's decent and I do love that it has active ingredients to not only soften and moisturize, bit to also help treat bumpiness and rough patches. I felt soft after but it's texture makes it harder to spread on your skin. I felt like I had to use more than a slightly thinner lotion to cover the same area. It's a good price for the ingredients you're getting but because it takes more lotion, it just doesn't last very long before you need another tube. Also, if you have older or thinner skin that thickness may tug a bit when rubbing it in. Scent was faint and okay but not as lavender forward as I wanted. It also had a kinda weird background smell from the base ingredients too, but it all fades pretty quickly. For a lotion with active ingredients I will stick with Flamingo body butter and for pretty scented lotion I'll stick with Eos or Hempz",

                "reviewText": "I have very dry hands and this is great handcream. Vitamin E is very good for skin and I love the neroli and lavender scent. Ifirst bought in the 2 oz size then had to have the bigger size and bought 2 at the same time so I wouldn't go without. It keeps my hands hydrated. My hands can get chapped and crack so using this daily is a good preventative. Highly recommend. Led me to other products with neroli. I'm a long time lavender essential oil user so it's a great combination for me.",
