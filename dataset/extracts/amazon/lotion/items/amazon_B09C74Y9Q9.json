Now for the elephant in the room, the smell. I don't mind it, it's not the OG coconut smell anymore, I can deal with it. Unfortunately the guys in my house can not. I put it on in the morning, and by the time I'm ready to shower the smell has dissipated. For people with eczema this doesn't help, try AmLactin it has a really high concentration of Latic acid but is also unfortunately a lot more expensive. Oh and if the smell of this bothers you, buckle up!",
