It leaves a nice, gently matte, glow (not greasy at all); Despite how light it feels, the coverage is phenomenal and sweat-proof, which is surprising because most sunscreens this protective are very thick to the touch and feel like sludge when applying. Also, an extra surprise: The smell is not only heavenly, but also not overwhelming (like most sunscreens). I will not be buying any other sunscreens other than this one after this. Highly Recommend!Note: I only use this on my body, so I can't say whether it transfers/irritates the eyes.",

It\u2019s a thicker whipped texture which feels drier to touch although the finish is as shiny as typical spf. Takes longer to rub out than other chemical spf I own. Would probably best on body if you don\u2019t like a slick wet feeling. I use spf for face mainly so doesn\u2019t benefit me. I\u2019ll use and finish but wouldn\u2019t repurchase. My favorite spf from this brand is there mineral tinted and the gel in the bronze bottle \u201cinstant bronze\u201dThe light scent, high spf and affordability are the best features of this item.",
