Sometimes it last until the next shower. The scent is good and the product itself is a good moisturizer without the overly oily, greasy feel. Its just the right amount, I like that because theres another lotion from this brand and man you put it on and you feel like a greasy piece of bacon, it was horrendous durring the summer. I am so happy to have found this formula. Its way better, I get moisturized without having to worry about my poor pores being clogged...or sliding of my bed sheets.",
