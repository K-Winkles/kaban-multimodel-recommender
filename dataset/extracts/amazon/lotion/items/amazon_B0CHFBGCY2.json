I have terrible skin - it\u2019s oily, dry, crepey, saggy, wrinkly - you name it\u2026 but this is moisturizing and makes it super soft to the touch and it just feels good to live in. I hate most lotions, they seem tacky, sink in without accomplishing anything, feel oily\u2026 but this isn\u2019t any of those! It\u2019s not heavy, my skin drinks it up and it only feels a little oily for an hour or so if I put too much on\u2026 which I do sometimes bc I like to bathe in it! My hands are even awesome - it\u2019s winter and I wash them a lot and they are always dry to the point they are rough and almost cracking\u2026 not now - my body feels like silk!!!! Made my husband feel my dry legs and now he is stealing my lotion. But the pun doesn\u2019t work\u2026 I\u2019d like to find a good pump for it - or even a squirt top\u2026 it\u2019s annoying to have to unscrew the pump, pull the pump out of the bottle then screw it back in.",
