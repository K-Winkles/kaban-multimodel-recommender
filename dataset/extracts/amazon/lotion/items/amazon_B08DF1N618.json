Has a gell like property that absorbs in seconds and really does last for a good day on your skin. It does have a strong smell that dissipates after a while, remember it does say \"mens\" on the bottle so it is a masculine-ish scent; my wife still uses it sometimes. Works great on the hands especially if you using your hands outdoors or car work, sports.. etc, you won't have slippage because it absorbs almost entirely.One of the few lotions/moisturizers on the market like this, and I hope they never discontinue it..",

                "reviewText": "I bought this after I ran out of Nivea's female version of this lotion. These \"breathable\" lotions are the only kind lotion i'm willing to tolerate cause I can't stand how most lotions make my skin and clothes feel all gross and greasy.This lotion isn't ultra moisturizing but it definitely gets the job done. For reference, I live in a dry climate and I take hot showers so my skin gets dry enough that I get visible flakes if I don't moisturize (no amount of exfoliation makes these flakes go away so I guess you could say my skin gets pretty dry). This lotion is adequate for that. It sinks into your skin faster than regular lotion and more importantly: it doesn't leave any gross residue! I don't like how it takes a little bit longer to sink in than the other one, but I would say the main difference between the male and female version is the lack of soy and the scent.When I ordered this I assumed it would have less of a scent than the tropical women's version, but unfortunately, it has a really strong perfume to it. Oddly, it smells more perfumish than cologne-ish to me (I don't particularly like it but neither do I hate it). What bothers me is that it's strong enough that it sometimes feels like it hurts my nose, so if strong scents irritate you I would steer clear.Luckily, I've found that the scent doesn't linger, but I will definitely be going back to the female version (regardless of the soy). The scent of that one lingers, but at least it actually smells good!",
