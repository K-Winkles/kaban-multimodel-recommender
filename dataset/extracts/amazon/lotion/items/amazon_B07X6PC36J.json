                "reviewText": "As an older woman I do have dry aging skin. Bought this product hoping it would help. The first couple of days I noticed that it seemed to evaporate and leave my skin drier that when first applied. Thought maybe that would change after a week or so. Nope. This product is horrible. Used it for 6 weeks with the same awful results; apply, wait about an hour, dry skin back. Have since found a better product.",

And it feels a lot better on my skin than thick heavy lotions. They feel like they are coating my skin and that it can\u2019t breathe. Ordering my 3rd bottle today.",
