Yes it's a bit greasy or sticky when first applied, but I find that my skin drinks it in quickly...my skin has become drier as I've aged so this is very helpful. I also have eczema on my lower legs and this cream keeps it pretty well in check, and is soothing and stops the itch when I do have a flare-up. It moisturizes my skin and keeps it moisturized all day and through the night. I personally like the coconut fragrance, but it doesn't stick around for long so if I wear EDT it doesn't interfere with the scent. Can't go wrong with Palmers products! I've stopped using all other brands.",

I think it works so much better than coconut oil/butter (which someone told me is awesome) With this stuff I have gained no new stretch marks even with almost being due so my belly is very large. I put it on after showers or before bed as it takes a long time to absorb into the skin. It is also very greasy once applied. Very happy with this product. I still haven't gone through this one tub and it has been about 7 months. I have even skipped a few days of application and still feel good in the belly. I do recommend pairing this product with the lotion as it's easier to apply, absorbs quickly, way less greasy. Make it a double whammy for moisture.",

This is very good for extra skin moisturizing.Ingredients, as listed on the jar: Theobroma Cocoa (Cocoa) Extract, mineral oil (Paraffinum Liquium), Microcrystalline Wax (Cera Microcristallina), Theobroma Cocoa (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Dimethicone, Fragrance (parfum), Tocopherol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Beta Carotene (CI 40800), Zea Mays (Corn) Oil, Isopropyl Myristate, Benzoyl Benzoate, Benzoyl Cinnamate. As labeled.When you need more than lotion, or even creams can provide, this will surely oil up skin. My personal preference is to smear onto very dry skin, then shower off, occasionally. I wouldn't, personally, need to use daily, although some reviewers say they have.",
