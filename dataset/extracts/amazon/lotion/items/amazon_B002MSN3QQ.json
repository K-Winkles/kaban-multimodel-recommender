                "reviewText": "As a woman past 40 with acne and sensitive skin, I'm constantly searching for sunscreen that doesn't make me break out or irritate. A couple of years ago, while in the tropics during winter, everyone thought I had a bad sunburn, but no, it was hives all over my chest, neck, and face. I looked like a swollen lobster, which is not a good look when you are actually eating lobster.I've tried every brand I can find in all different price ranges. Inevitably, I toss the ones that make me break out in hives or are super irritating, and most of the remaining clog my pores or otherwise encourage facial acne, so they end up in a bag for the rest of my family to use. The last time I was at a beach, I just hauled out my failed pricey facial sunscreens, slathered them all over my legs, and wore a gigantic hat.Then my blue-eyed red-headed niece (extremely sensitive to the sun) told me about Elta MD UV Clear Face Sunscreen. Her dermatologist had recommended it because of her acne issues. I was a bit skeptical because I'd been prescribed all kinds of treatments by my dermatologist, and none of them worked very well, but I've been using the Elta MD all this summer and couldn't be more pleased with the results. I still wear a hat because we all know no sunscreen protects 100%, but most importantly, my skin has actually gotten clearer.It's expensive but worth it if, like me, every other sunscreen makes you break out in rash or pimples. As you can see in the pictures, a small amount goes a long way and is completely sheer with no residue. One pump from the applicator is exactly enough for the face and neck. Because of the price, I use it only on my face, so my small bottle of Elta MD has lasted for about two months.It's not super moisturizing, but if I apply my moisturizer first and give it time to settle, I can benefit from both. Another great advantage of this lotion is that it can be reapplied without residue building up. I've used products that get gross after a couple of layers, but this really is very sheer and seems to absorb completely into the skin.There is no added fragrance, so you don't have to worry about weird odors, and Elta MD also makes a tinted sunscreen that I sometimes wear over the UV clear so I can even out my skin tone AND discourage acne. All around, the best sunscreen I've ever used.",

The lightweight formula feels like silk on my skin, and it absorbs quickly without any greasy residue. It\u2019s a game-changer for my sensitive skin \u2013 no irritation or breakouts. The broad-spectrum SPF 46 provides excellent sun protection, and the added niacinamide has visibly improved my skin\u2019s texture and tone. I love that it works well under makeup, creating a smooth base without causing any pilling. The pump dispenser is not only convenient but also ensures minimal product wastage. This sunscreen has become a daily essential for me, and I can\u2019t recommend it enough for anyone in search of a reliable, dermatologist-recommended sun protection solution!",

Mind you, im switching from being a long-time user of Neutrugena Spf50 clear skin (since 2013/14) also for the past few weeks I started using La Roche Posay and that also didn't cause breakouts but just something about it doesnt feel good... and just in one day, EltaMD feels much better when applied.
