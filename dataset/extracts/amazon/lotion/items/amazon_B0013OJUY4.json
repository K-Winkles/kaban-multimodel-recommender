                "reviewText": "I normally purchase the 33-oz to keep in the bathroom for use after showering. This is what happens with pump bottles\u2014After you have used 3/4 of the product, there is still quite a bit of product left in the bottom of the container. It took me a while, but I shook and got out almost all that was left, which was a lot. For my next bottle, I\u2019m getting out my small hack saw to cut the container in half and make it easier to scoop out the remaining lotion. I wonder if most people toss it after the pump stops reaching the lotion on the bottom? It\u2019s just a waste of good product unless you can save & use the rest.",
