That's why Cur\u00e9l Skincare is on a mission to end dry skin, for good. This mission is what compelled Cur\u00e9l scientists to gain unparalleled knowledge of what happens in the skin when it becomes dry. They found that ceramides, the moisture-retaining molecules within the skin, are vital to healthy skin. When ceramides are lost, skin becomes dry and damaged. This is what drove us to develop our Advanced Ceramide Complex and include it in all Cur\u00e9l moisturizers. Our moisturizers work at the source of dryness, helping replenish skin's ceramide levels, for restored and hydrated skin. We can't wait to see what incredible things can be accomplished with dry skin worries behind you! Cur\u00e9l, the end of dry skin, the beginning of so much more.",

                "reviewText": "My Eczema recently came back after 30 years of being in remission much to my surprise and horror. But because it's been so long I had no clue what's currently out there for eczema products. I found the NEA website (National Eczema Association) and it's been very helpful. I was on their Facebook page one day and saw a couple of people recommended this Curel 'Itch Defense' formula. I have to be honest, Curel is one of the last companies I would ever think to turn to for this type of product; I know they're a fairly popular brand, but I just didn't think of them as making \"serious\" products for skin conditions. But I went to Curel's website and checked it out.Sure enough, it's a fragrance-free formula designed for eczema and with ingredients I was told to look for and none of the ingredients I was told to avoid. Two things sold me on trying it: 1. It had the NEA Seal of Acceptance. That's a big deal, that means they went through vigorous tests and reformulating in order to meet the criteria of the NEA's standards, including avoiding all ingredients on the NEA's known list of irritants. 2. The price! I had spent hours comparing labels on some very expensive eczema-friendly moisturizers and here was one that seemed to fit the bill AND came in a huge 20 ounce bottle for a very fair price.The lotion is thicker than I expected, somewhere between a lotion and a cream in thickness. It's white but slightly translucent which reflects the highly emollient ingredients like petrolatum and dimethicone. Both are said to be excellent for eczema but many eczema moisturizers will have one or the other, this has both. It goes on thick but spreads VERY nicely. It's definitely on the heavy side, you can really feel that \"barrier\" on the skin. That's exactly what eczema patients need, a moisture barrier on their skin - not a lotion that disappears/evaporates, but the downside to that is that I personally find it an annoying feeling, a slight tackiness on the skin that lingers for a long time, but I'll live.I did get immediate (albeit not total) relief of my INSANE itching. It didn't disappear entirely, but I got relief of the worst of it and some areas have stopped itching, so it's still a huge improvement. I've started using it in two ways: Putting it all over my body morning and night and after showers, and also \"spot treating\" areas, spreading a small amount like an ointment on an area that starts itching out of the blue - it soothes the itch enough for me to leave it alone and I repeat that as needed. I've decided this: I do still need to find a specific treatment cream or ointment to put on the worst areas during flare-ups, but this Curel formula is excellent for after showers to seal in moisture and for general use all over my body on a daily basis during dry winter months. I have to admit I've misjudged Curel; it turns out this is an excellent quality formula that I probably would not have tried if it weren't for the NEA Seal on the bottle.",

                "reviewText": "I've used Curel Itch Defense for many years, at least 8 at this point. It's heavily moisturizing without feeling heavy at all and completed scent free. I struggle with keratosis pilaris and have used a wide variety of body lotions to help control it, and what I've noticed is that every time I stray from this, no matter how heavy or highly recommended the product is for KP, I end up with a reoccurrence of the issue within a week. Curel has been a consistent performer along with exfoliating using a hard towel or salux cloth in the shower daily.All three of my littles have or have had childhood eczema and I didn't hesitate to use Curel for them during breakouts. It doesn't sting their sensitive skin and helps control and abate the flares so I don't have to heavily use their prescribed corticosteroid cream.This product is so effective and inoffensive in how it feels, wears and smells that my husband also uses and loves it. He's not a guy who is too into cosmetic applications, and suffers from dry skin so it's a major win that he will use this to help prevent irritation and itching, especially on the hands and feet.",
