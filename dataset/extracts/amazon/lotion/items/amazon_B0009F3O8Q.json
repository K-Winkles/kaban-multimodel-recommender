None of the other products I've used have ever moisturized this well. Probably because it's one of the only products that's not watered down with alcohol and water, and not loaded with petroleum. It has actual moisturizing ingredients. Very nice mild smell. Sinks into skin well, not super greasy. Super thick consistency. Very affordable. But the spout bottle leaves a ton of product at the bottom that the spout can't get out, so I have to use a utility knife to cut the bottle in half to get the rest out, There'd be a lot of product wasted if I didn't, still a great product.",

When I saw it came for a very reasonable price along with a lotion with which I was not familiar I decided to take a chance and I'm glad I did. The lotion is very healing and does not leave a residue on your clothes or sheets. Using it overnight leaves any skin problems on the road to healing as well as soft and natural feeling. I would definitely buy this again. I have a Lotta respect for pPlmers products.",

The smell has always been subtle but noticeable. A bottle of the lotion has always lasted me a few months or more with every day usage. Having said that, the bottle of lotion I received is much different in quality than I\u2019ve ever noticed from this brand before. The lotion is very thin and the smell is very fake, like hot cocoa powder mix.I\u2019m hoping this is a one off. I will continue to buy this product until this become a recurrence.",

D\u00e1 pra notar que \u00e9 feito da mais pura manteiga de cacau, at\u00e9 pela cor meio amarelada. Como nada \u00e9 perfeito, o \u00fanico contra \u00e9 a embalagem, que \u00e9 bonita, mas que peca no pump. O creme, por ser bastante consistente, sai com um pouco de dificuldade, e at\u00e9 virando a embalagem de cabe\u00e7a para baixo \u00e9 dif\u00edcil fazer com que ele saia facilmente.",
