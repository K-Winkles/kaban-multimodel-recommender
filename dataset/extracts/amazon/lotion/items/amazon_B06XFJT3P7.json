                "reviewText": "I have only been using this a few days but I think I am going to make this a staple in my skincare regimen. I have had KP for years but tried to ignore the problem. Recently it seemed like my skin problems started compounding so I knew I needed to do something about it. This is just one of the products I started using, along with the body wash by the same company, a serum by a different company, a scrub by a different company, a couple of other lotions that address different issues, and some new \u201ctools\u201d like body scrubbers and also an IPL treatment device. It\u2019s only been a few days but I\u2019m so glad I started this journey to fixing my skin. I thought I was just experiencing aging skin, but I have already noticed a huge improvement across the board, and I suspect I will continue to see improvements the longer I use this. My skin looks and feels like skin I thought I would never have - skin that I thought people only get through good genetics. I do think my skin needed to adjust to this lotion just a bit, but I haven\u2019t had any bad reactions - just a few new red bumps but they definitely don\u2019t come close to the bumps and redness it has gotten rid of. I use this twice a day, mostly on my arms and legs. The days that I\u2019ve forgotten to apply my other lotions, my skin is still soft and smooth for hours with just this on - at least half a day. I was trying to use clean, natural products for years, but finally caved and added a few products like this to my routine and it has made a massive difference in such a short time that I think I\u2019m going to be a customer for life. I find myself just feeling my skin in disbelief that this is actually my skin! I would say redness has reduced by ~60%, bumps have reduced by ~40%, ingrown hairs have reduced by ~70%. Regarding the other products that have helped, I live in a very dry environment and needed a water-based lotion with hyaluronic acid, and I added another lotion with squalene to help seal in the moisture. I also needed to add physical exfoliation to help remove dead skin cells, help these products penetrate the skin, and to help stimulate the skin.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Best lotion Ive tried for KP",
                "reviewText": "So I've had KP since I was a teenager, and my dermatologists have always prescribed me either a lactic acid lotion or just a moisturizing lotion with urea. These never worked for me, and I pretty much gave up on treating my KP after a few months. It was a terrible, sad, dark time :*(...Now that I am a bit older and more sensible, I realize that it was kind of silly to feel so insecure about my skin. So even though I feel amazing now, I still wanted my skin to look as good as possible :) I decided to try those old lotions again, and stick with it at LEAST for a month. Fast forward a month and still nothing changed!Anyways, I ended up researching ALOT about KP and ingredients use to treat it. AHAs, BHAs, scrubs etc... That's how I ended up finding out about this lotion on google. I just felt like other products weren't strong enough for my KP, but this one definitely is. Usually lotions only have 10% glycolic acid, but that didn't work for me, so I wanted to try 15%. This was the only one that I found that had 2% salicylic acid also which apparently is great for deeper exfoliation. The lotion tingled a bit the first few times I applied it, so i knew it was working.Overall I think any exfoliation lotion with a high enough concentration of acids will work to smooth your skin, if you use it consistently everyday. BUT, with this you know its strong enough and its great for the redness which is what bothers me the most. ALSO the lotion smells great, not like most of the other lotions with glycolic acid. I've been using this lotion twice a day everyday for 3 months now and i'd say the improvement is slow, but steady, getting better by 10% each month that goes by. Definitely give this a try!",

If you have a rough patch of skin drying out from a razor or just a rash just from it being a consistently washed area this should clear it up pretty fast and give it a brighter silk like consistency \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd",

I always end up using a box cutter which, at my age I have no business messing with. Additionally, once I've gotten the exfoliating lotion open there is no guarantee the turn- to-release device will work. I know I'm doing it right and it simply does not work. At KP Touch someone there should try it themselves.",

The bumps are noticeably fewer and their skin smoother. It's actually working to make their skin smoother.I was also nervous that it would irritate their skin since they have sensitive skin, but no complaint there either! The skin seems a little pinker, but they don't seem to have pain or itching, so that's good.I highly recommend!!",
