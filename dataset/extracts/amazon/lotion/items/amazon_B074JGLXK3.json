The scent doesn\u2019t last that long, so it doesn\u2019t clash with my perfume either. It smells so good though when I put it on and it instantly makes my dry, itchy skin feel better! It\u2019s going to be my new go-to lotion for sure! I even use it on my face and it doesn\u2019t make my face break out or burn! I wish I knew about this sooner! It\u2019s so hard to find the perfect lotion. I\u2019ve not seen this at the stores either, so hopefully it stays on Amazon! It was packaged extremely well too. I received it intact without any leakage. I really do buy a lot of different creams and lotions because I can never find one that meets all of my needs, but this one checks all the boxes for me and just feels nice to apply! I really cannot stress enough how clean and yummy it smells, either. Plus, it feels cooling upon application. I would love to find it in a little trial size bottle to keep in my purse! I will be repurchasing! It\u2019s a huge bottle too for a very reasonable price",

                "reviewText": "Despite having pretty solid ingredients, the scent was hit or miss; my friend liked the smell but I didn't. That said, nobody who tried the lotion enjoyed the feel. It's sticky and doesn't seem to absorb into the skin, nor did it moisturize well. Instead, it seemed to deposit on the surface of the skin. Maybe it'd be a decent lotion for body massages, but not worth it in my opinion.",
