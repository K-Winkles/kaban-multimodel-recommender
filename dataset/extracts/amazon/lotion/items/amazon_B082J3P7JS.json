I do love Hempz products, in general - they're light going on, not too greasy, and provide a good amount of hydration - but this particular scent is AMAZING! I've had friends/colleagues stop me to ask me what scent I am wearing when I walk by them. I ran out of this scent and couldn't find it anywhere locally, so I had to turn to amazon to help me out.",

I felt the sandalwood was too strong and did not like the apple scent pairing with it. I have had many other Hempz lotions and I have liked all the previous scents so I feel like it's unfair to take away a star because of my personal preference. The lotion is great. It absorbs nicely, doesn't feel greasy and doesn't just sit on top of my skin like other lotions. I still recommend it even though this particular scent was a miss for me",

Hempz is literally the best lotion on the market and helps my skin issues. I am not affected by the scent in anyway and this lotion absorbs quickly, not leave me feeling sticky or greasy! Amazing 10/10.",

The sandalwood and apple are strong enough to lighten up the room, but subtle enough that it isn't overwhelming by any means, and I find it a little addictive. The moisturization is helping his dry skin too.",
