                "reviewText": "I have pretty sensitive facial skin so I can't use anything with fragrance. It just gets red if I apply any lotion that has added scent. This lotion is solid, it is thick but absorbs fairly quickly. I would not use this 5 minutes before you head out to work, since it does take a bit of time to absorb into the skin. I use it at night before I go to sleep. If necessary, I'll add a SMALL dab to my face before heading out. When I wake up after applying the lotion the night before, my face feels hydrated. It has been at least two weeks or longer since I started to apply this lotion... so far it has healed my red dry skin. I may have to wait to test it during the dry winter, but we shall see. I do not see any problems using product. I have already covered my entire face with this thick lotion and felt no pain as I would with many other brand that may contain fragrances. The only products that I have been able to use is Cetaphil (ONLY the \"body\" cream) and Aquaphor. Cetaphil body cream is kind of light, so it absorbs quickly. When I wake up in the mornings I can tell the Cetaphil doesn't really keep moisture long periods of time. Aquaphor is mineral based petroleum, kind of super-oily. So one moisturizes too short term, while the other kind of keeps your face too oily. This Eucerin Original Healing Lotion kind of fits in between. Highly recommend Eucerin Original Healing Lotion or the cream version.",

                "reviewText": "I've been buying Eucerin Original Healing Rich Body Lotion for a few years now and I love it. I particularly enjoy the fact that it doesn't have a noticeable scent and it doesn't irritate my rather sensitive skin.The past two bottles I've ordered from Amazon, however, have pumps that leak. It doesn't start immediately, but after a couple of weeks (even when not in use), lotion builds up around the base of the pump and oozes down the side of the bottle. These were ordered some months apart, so the problem clearly has not been fixed. Not planning to switch brands any time soon, but it still should be noted.",

I wanted to try some for my self. I will never go back to normal lotion. It makes your skin so soft and shiny with moisture. I use this atleast once or twice a week along with other lotion in between the days I don\u2019t use this.",
