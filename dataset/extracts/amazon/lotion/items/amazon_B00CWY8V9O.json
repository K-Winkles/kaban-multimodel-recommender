                "reviewText": "I have been suffering with dyshidrotic eczema for years now. It started on my hands as a child, and now as a 27 year old it's moved to my feet. It's miserable! Super itchy, sweaty, blisters pop, feet dry out, then crack, then get sweaty and itchy again and the rotation begins again. I was hesitant to buy thus, seemed expensive to me, but after all the great reviews, and trying literally everything else, I bought it. This stuff is amazing! Buy it now! It's for sensitive skin, not scented, and drys nicely! It doesnt make you greasey or clog your pores! That was another issue. If I put any other lotion on, gold bond, equate, dove, anything sensitive, it was way too thick and made my feet/eczema flair up much much worse! This stuff is just great in general! You don't even need to have eczema to use it. Super moisturizing! RECOMMENDED!!!!!",
