        "description": "Vaseline Intensive Care Essential Healing is now Vaseline Intensive Care Nourishing Moisture. Made with Pure Oat Extract and Ultra-Hydrating Lipids, Vaseline Intensive Care Nourishing Moisture Lotion helps keep your skin looking healthy and hydrated. With daily exposure to environmental triggers (like wind, lack of humidity, and sun), skin\u2019s natural moisture barrier can break down, allowing water to escape the skin. But the Ultra-Hydrating lipids in our Nourishing Moisture lotion fortify the skin barrier and replenish moisture to allow the skin\u2019s natural barrier to recover. Vaseline Intensive Care Nourishing Moisture Lotion, formulated with Ultra-Hydrating Lipids and Pure Oat Extract, locks in moisture and deeply nourishes for healthy-looking skin. This body moisturizer is clinically tested to provide 90% more moisture (vs. untreated skin). This body lotion for dry skin absorbs fast and provides 48-hour non-greasy moisture. Use this dermatologist-tested body lotion daily on dry, rough skin for stronger, noticeably healthier skin. This Vaseline lotion bottle is made of 50% recycled plastic. Our ambition is to get to 100% recycled plastic in the near future. Since 2018, we've used 337 Metric Tons of recycled plastic across the Vaseline product portfolio in North America. Our Intensive Care range works to heal dry skin from deep within. Explore the range of Vaseline products, including Vaseline lotion, and enjoy the healing power of Vaseline. Vaseline has a range of products to help heal, soothe, and moisturize all skin. We believe skin health is essential for well-being. That\u2019s why Vaseline is working towards giving everybody, everywhere, access to the skin care they need.",

                "reviewText": "This 4-count of Vaseline Intensive Body Care Lotion is ideal for those who are familiar with the Vaseline line of intensive body care products. This is a four 20.3 fluid-ounce bottles of Vaseline Intensive Body Care Lotion with ultra-hydrating lipids and oat extract.I've been using this in moderation since it primarily targets those with normal skin and I do have more sensitive skin. So, I don't want to overdo it. This is intended as a daily lotion for rough and dry skin and it really combines the best features of traditional Vaseline with a body lotion. It's a pretty effective combination and I definitely am seeing improvement in my dry skin areas and my rough skin areas (mostly my hands as I'm a wheelchair user and spend most of my day wheeling my chair).This lotion is designed to offer 48-hour moisture (so in some ways the whole \"daily\" moisturizer statement is a bit weird). I've been trying to aim for the 48-hours because it's better for my sensitive skin anyway and I do find the lotion to be effective. I do also find that if I use it every 48 hours that it tends to help prevent my skin from getting dry.There's an entire Vaseline Intensive Care Line and I'm definitely finding it to be a really solid line. I love this new one and I do find it to offer effective body care that prevents dry and rough skin and it does last longer than most similar body lotions. I'm a fan and will continue to use.",
