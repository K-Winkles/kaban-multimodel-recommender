                "reviewText": "I don't like to smell strongly of colognes, but I did want a little bit of a scent. This was perfect for that because you can easily use an amount to your \"taste.\" (but please don't taste it, it is not for tasting.) The scent profile isn't exactly what I'd call Palo Santo, but it's very nice nonetheless.",
