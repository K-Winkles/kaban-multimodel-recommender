Questa e' la versione crema fluida per il corpo, sorella della ben piu' famosa versione concentrata per il viso.Si stende facilmente, idrata la pelle del corpo e non appiccica (occorre farla assorbire per un paio di minuti). Ha uno strano odore (apparentemente di lavanda ma a me sembra cocco!!) che fortunatamente svanisce quasi subito.L'acquisto mensilmente con l'abbonamento amazon e risparmio un euro rispetto al prezzo pieno. Va bene anche come crema mani, piedi e volendo anche per il viso. Consigliata.",
