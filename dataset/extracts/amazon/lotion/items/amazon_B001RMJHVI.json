After handling chemicals and having my hands in a shampoo bowl all day every day, my hands tend to dry out to the point that some lotions can actually irritate and burn me. I heard about this moisturizer from my mom and she actually gave me a travel size bottle. I loved it so much I used it all within a couple weeks and needed a bigger bottle. Though it is a wee bit on the pricier side, the way it hydrates my skin will have me purchasing it over and over again once I run out. I have never had a lotion make my skin feel the way this one does. It is not greasy whatsoever but makes my hands feel silky soft. Like baby skin soft. The only thing I could do without is the fragrance. It smells similar to baby powder or the Airspun loose setting powder. It\u2019s strong at first but dissipates after a while. Fragrance aside, this lotion is a must have.",

The kiddos have it so badly they get horrific patches of dry red skin that looks like an alligator to the look and touch. They also claw themselves until they bleed and are constantly itchy. Eczema is not contagious but is hereditary and extremely uncomfortable and can be tied to allergies and asthma which I have all three, not sure if my kiddos have all of three yet since they are so young but unfortunately it appears they are heading in that direction. Eczema affects my children's sleep thus mine. Their skin is so bad that strangers feel the need to inquire about their skin or ask me what is wrong.I have taken my children to an immunology/dermatologist specialist at Children's hospital and I'm truly doing everything I can. I did NOT want to use steroids but I have to use a steroid cream when my 2.5 year old has a major flair up. The doctor has suggested showers then deep moisturizing as soon as she's out. Then to apply intense moisturizers, vasonline, comfortable soft pj's that are non skin iritants. I also have to use a steroid cream and Benedryl to assist with the itching. I have tried more creams than I care to list. The dermatologist also prescribed an anti-itch chewable tablet but my daughter refuses to take it so moisturizing and steroid creams are all I can do, thus incredibly important.I tried the Renew moisturizer after two of my friends swore by it and one was referred by her doctor to try it. Personally my dermatologist and the kid's dermatologist have never mentioned Renew but I will give almost anything a try. Here's my feed back. While two bottles are near $40 and some people may find that spendy, they are extremely large bottles at 20 ounces each and anyone buying eczema creams are used to this. Creams are usually higher in cost than lotions. As far as moisturizing it is nice but I wouldn't say it is the best thing that I have ever tried. It's not as thick as Eucerin or some of the other creams on the market so I feel I need to use more of it or add vasoline with it but it has a nice silky feel.The NEGATIVE and dealbreaker for me is that for a skin product that is supposed to heal skin sensitivities and issues it has FRAGRANCE added to it. This is UNHEARD of. Why would you add fragrance to something that is supposed to help those of us who have adverse reactions to frangrance? This makes no sense to me and it is an AWFUL smell. I know I'm sensitive but it has a really bad smell to it and I don't like my kids smelling like it, this sounds terrible but it kind of reminds me of the smell of a grandma (I'm not trying to be cruel, just honest). I'm going to use it because I purchased it and it does do an o.k job moisturizing but next time I order cream I'm going back to my other options which avoid fragrance. Some creams do have all natural oils which sometimes have a light scent but nothing that has the verbiage FRAGRANCE added. I also feel that you have to use it after a shower or it does not moisturize well and must be reapplied over and over throughout the day. If you don't have any adverse reactions or allergies than the fragrance most likely won't bother you but for someone like myself who is really sensitive I figured it is worth mentioning. I have tried a ton of other creams that people have said have awful smells and they haven't bothered me. This smell is definitely bothersome.Pros:-Moisturizes and feels silky on your skin which is nice-Just like it advertises \"nongreasy formula\", it does NOT feel greasy-If applied after a bath or shower it seems to lock in nicely & last for the majority of the day-The bottles are very large so I think the moisturizer has a great price point, it is also nice not to have to order the moisturizer every two weeks. Some moisturizer bottles are so small I continuously have to re-order them every other week which I find it to be very inconvenient.-I have been using it almost a week on my daughter's skin and it does seem to be keeping her skin moisturized nicely-The other thing worth mentioning is that some creams really hurt if your child has an open cut from scratching, so far my daughter has not complained which is awesome because usually when she's clawing is when she needs the moisturizer the most!Cons:Fragrance is added to the moisturizer (I'm very sensitive)The frangerance that is added smells awfulIf you don't use it right after showering or bathing the moisturizer doesn't lock in, however I find this is pretty normal for most moisturizers.Ingredients: For those of you like myself that need this info!Deionized Water, Glycerin USP, Petrolatum USP, Distearyldimonium Chloride, Isopropyl Palmitate, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Allantoin, T36-C5, Melaleuca Oil, Benzyl Alcohol, Fragrance.Company is listed s a product of USA, out of Idaho Falls, ID but distributed out of Australia and New Zealand.",
