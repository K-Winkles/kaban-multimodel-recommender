                "reviewText": "first - i am not kidding in the headline. i am extremely picky about hand cream, despite having hands that are dry as the sahara. if it's greasy or leaves a sort of film, i hate it. if it leaves my hands slick, i hate it even more. i had just given up finding anything outside of asian beauty brands - aside from l'occitaine, which, well, love their handcream, but my wallet does not love the price. until i picked up some of this stuff in desperation at the store. IT'S FANTASTIC. it doesn't sink in as instantly as some korean handcreams, but it sinks in pretty darn quick. it isn't greasy, it doesn't leave my hands slick, and it packs some real moisturising power. the scent is really lovely.best of all, since it's also for body, it is great to just put some on your feet at night and anywhere else that needs a bit of care like your elbows.i've absolutely been going through a tube of this about every two months. amazon makes it really easy to repurchase, and the cost is SO much better than having to special order from asian companies or having to fork over a huge amount of cash for very bougie handcream each time. plus i can use it on my feet as well, so it gets to replace not just one but *two* beauty products in my routine and save me even more money!",

I get a chocolate (or cocoa - go figure since it\u2019s cocoa butter lotion) scent right away, then after I\u2019ve worked it into my skin, it takes on a sweeter, cookie-like smell that others have mentioned. It\u2019s really a great lotion. Not greasy at all, goes on very easily and smooth. Absorbs quickly and leaves your skin very soft I love it!",

I'm ok with the product but probably wont buy it again. Just being honest.",

                "reviewText": "Positives- This lotion has a nice scent, but it smells very strongly of cocoa butter though. If you're a fan of cocoa butter, then great, but if not, then I wouldn't recommend buying it. I liked the scent, so I consider this a positive.- My favorite thing about this lotion is that it moisturized very well without making my skin feel greasy.Negatives- As much as I liked the scent, I couldn't get rid of it. Whatever I touched for the entire day seemed to smell like cocoa butter, and no matter how many times I washed my hands, the smell still lingered. I don't mind a strong smelling lotion, but it would have been nice to not last for quite so long.- In my opinion, this is a very expensive lotion for the amount that comes in here. I should have known that when I bought it, but I guess that I was hoping that it was a really high quality lotion. It was very good, but I didn't feel that it did a better job moisturizing than bigger lotions that I've bought at a cheaper price.Overall ThoughtsI liked this lotion, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who is looking for cruelty free products, or anyone who is a fan of strong cocoa butter scents. For me personally though, I didn't think that it was quite worth it for the money, so I probably wouldn't purchase it again.",
