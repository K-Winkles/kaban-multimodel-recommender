Reminds me of summer days at the beach and that is heaven. The scent is not strong or over powering, subtle but nice. Fresh and perky. This lotion is not heavy, not greasy, soaks in quickly and feels like silk on your skin. After continued use, it was then I found I could not use sesame oil. Which is one of these ingredients. And Im heartbroken. Everything I needed but one little culprit. I am now on one more arduous journey to find the moisturizer that works for my temperamental skin. If this is not your issue, you are lucky. This is a great lotion.",
