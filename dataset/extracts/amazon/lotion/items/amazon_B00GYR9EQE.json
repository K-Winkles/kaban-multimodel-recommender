The late Yogi Bhajan (Founder) was a Kundalini Yoga teacher and master from India who had moved to the West to teach yoga, meditation, and healthy eating habits. His students were from all walks of life. In their quest to live a healthy Ayurvedic lifestyle, Yogi Bhajan provided his students with a collection of ancient Ayurvedic formulas for oil blends that had been used for centuries in India. The massage market valued a high quality oil blend for massage as the popularity of holistic products grew in the United States, and thus Soothing Touch became one of the trusted massage product manufacturers in the United States.",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s pretty good, while I have had better lotions in my 13 years in massage therapy but it\u2019s not bad for the price. The scent is a little weird but can be covered up with essential oils. It\u2019s a little bit of a slightly thinner texture than the average lotion. In general a cream is better for winter due to the drier skin. So it\u2019s not the most ideal for winter, just because you\u2019ll use more, but for the summer it\u2019s perfect. Either way it works just fine and that\u2019s what matters.",

It\u2019s thin enough to provide a good glide for clients but doesn\u2019t dry too quickly if you go into deeper tissue work after your warming up the area. I don\u2019t have any issues with the consistency being too thin or too thick. Totally unscented and it works really well for mixing with essential oils for aromatherapy massage.My clients also say they don\u2019t feel overly greasy after their session as the day goes on which I\u2019m very happy about.Can\u2019t argue with the price and I\u2019m shocked at how amazing this is.
