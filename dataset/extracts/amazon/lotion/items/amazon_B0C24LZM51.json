I've only been using this a few days but I already notice a difference in the feel of my skin. I feel so soft and not dry. The scent is a light beachy smell like other reviews mention. I think the product will last a while because a little goes a long way for me. I don't feel oily after applying and it dries fast. I think the scent lasts too, which I don't normally notice with other lotions. A great product all around, I can't wait to try other scents when I finish this one!",

                "reviewText": "I typically use very affordable aloe vera gel to moisturize/hydrate my body after showers, but I smelled this Ouai St. Barts body cream in a Sephora and couldn't get the scent out of my head. I opted to purchase this for a splurge, and I don't regret it at all. I always get compliments after I wear it, and it's only pilled for me when I REALLY slather it on to my body. A little bit definitely goes a long way when it comes to this cream- the scent is strong and you may find it a tad headache inducing, however. That's why I try not to use it at night since it also makes my bed smell strongly of the scent and I opt to use it during the day/after morning showers.",
