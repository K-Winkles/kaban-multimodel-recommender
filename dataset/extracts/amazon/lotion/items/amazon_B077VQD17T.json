                "reviewText": "Reviews for a product such as this are always going to be subjective. What works well for one person\u2019s skin might be hell on someone else\u2019s.For me, this product is a must buy. The lotion moisturizes and provides a barrier against dryness that will last all day unless I\u2019m washing my hands frequently with harsh soap. I primarily use this for my hands and feet, as I have an incredible sensitivity to dry fingertips that renders me incapable of using my hands until the problem is rectified. I have also used it on the rest of my body and have experienced positive results there as well. It softens skin ant that softness lasts.Now, there is something that some people might not appreciate. If you\u2019re sensitive to strong or concentrated scents, you may not like this lotion. The scent is a nice one, but it can be very powerful. I don\u2019t mind this, but it\u2019s something to consider. The scent isn\u2019t, in my opinion, chemical, but quite sweet. If you\u2019re not a fan of powerful scents or they give you a headache, either test this first somehow, use it sparingly or turn your attention to a product with a less concntrated fragrance.",

It's sweet, but in a subtle way without being overpowering.If you live in a dry environment, I can't recommend this lotion highly enough.",

Anyhow the pump is great and dispenses the most generous amount just enough for each body section. The moisturiser glides on easily and absorbs so nicely and my skin stays smooth until i shower the next day and re apply. 10/10 would recommend.",
