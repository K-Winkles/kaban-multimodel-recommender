I have frequent migraines triggered by fragrances, but this was another Hempz winner. The scent is strong enough to be noticed but not overpowering, and I wish I had bought the bigger bottle. I love how moisturizing it is without being greasy. If you're looking for something that is fruity but not reminiscent of cheap teen dollar store fragrances, this is a great option.",

Also, it doesn\u2019t leave a sticky feeling on my skin. My skin has never felt this refreshed before with any other moisturizer. With a light refreshing scent that doesn\u2019t cause headaches. This is one of my top favorite moisturizers out there. Would definitely recommend to all of my friends",

I wanted the pineapple and melon because everyone was raving about the scent. But they didn't have it in trial size so I got the green tea and pear. It smells very nice and it went on smoothly and felt good at first. I noticed my hands did not stay moisturized for long. As a matter of fact, they felt kind of dry after an hour or two. I guess this just wasn't for me. I have dry skin, but not overly dry. Cerave moisturizing cream works great, but I wanted something with a nice scent. Maybe the age defying Hempz might work better for me, but I don't think I can return it after using the product. Plus some people were comparing the scent to baby powder, which I absolutely hate. Glad it works for some of you.",
