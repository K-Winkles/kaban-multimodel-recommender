                "reviewText": "I absolutely loathe lotions. I hate applying them. I hate the greasy residue. I hate the overly perfumed mess that causes me migraines. I would rather deal with skin so dry that wearing clothes or the sheets on my skin is painful (if you know what I mean, you *know* what I mean). I also deal with acne, psoriasis, contact eczema, and KP (to list a few). So, I had avoided any lotions for 41 years until someone in one of my FB groups who deals with the same issues I do (hEDS/JHS/HSD) turned me on to this stuff. It's absolutely amazing...now that doesn't mean I like applying it as someone who's lived 40 odd years without a lotion habit, but it does mean that I do use it daily (or at least every other day depending on my shower schedule). I even moved to a cold high desert and I have better skin than I ever did in a warmer humid climate because I'm actually using this lotion regularly. So here are the reasons I like it: 1) if not applied too heavily (one squirt per leg is enough), this stuff sinks in within minutes. I can put some on my hands and use my phone two minutes later or handle food or do anything else without feeling like I'm covered in oil (ugh hate that feeling). 2) I no longer have painful sheets/clothes problems because I'm actually using this stuff (see #1). 3) there's no perfume or scent that will give me migraines. It doesn't smell the best upon application (some people say it has a bit of an ammonia scent, but that's gone in seconds), but that doesn't bother me. 4) I can use this without breaking out. 5) when I do slip and stop using it and my skin starts hurting with any contact, this lotion also provides negative reinforcement because it stings (no seriously, this stuff stings on open wounds or really dry skin) which helps remind me that I *can't* go days without using lotion or bad things start happening. Anyway, if any of the above resonates with you, give this stuff a try. It's truly a game-changer.",

It does a lot to soften and gently exfoliate dull, dry and rough skin. For my feet, I like to put it on before bed and then wear cotton socks to bed, the next day my feet are so soft. With regular use, the last time I got a pedicure, the nail technician told me the bottom of my feet had hardly any dead skin. I do think it is the best lotion I have ever used for my hands and feet. I have repurchased this a couple of times and will continue to purchase this.",

The lotion application is lovely ... not too thick and not too thin ... and it does feel moisturizing; however, the smell of this lotion, even though it is unscented, is extremely unpleasant to me. Some people say it smells like cat urine; others say it has a heavy smell of maple syrup. I cannot pinpoint the smell. It is strong and horrible. This is not a lotion I will apply before going out in public. I will continue to use it until gone but I will not purchase this lotion again.",

So bad I almost returned it.Then I noticed my skin stayed hydrated for 3-4 days, way longer than my prior go to lotion.So I set out to see if I could manage my way around the smell, and feel I cracked the code.I start by using equal amounts of Amlactin and a pleasant smelling lotion (Maja). After application, I choose a fragrance from my collection that isn\u2019t too strong and not very long lasting (Tabac and Mac Turquatic work great) then spray liberally everywhere I applied lotion.By the time the cologne fades, so does the bad smell of the lotion.A little creativity and I\u2019m loving this lotion!",

                "reviewText": "I've been using Sandoz Amlactin Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion for a while now, and I must say it has been a game-changer for my skin.This lotion lives up to its promise of providing daily moisturization. It's incredibly hydrating, and I noticed a significant improvement in the texture of my skin. It's especially effective for dry and rough patches.One of the standout features of this lotion is its exfoliating properties. The inclusion of lactic acid helps to gently slough off dead skin cells, leaving my skin feeling smoother and more radiant. However, if you have sensitive skin, it's important to be cautious and perhaps do a patch test before using it on a larger area, as lactic acid can be a bit strong for some.The lotion absorbs well into the skin, and it doesn't leave a greasy residue. I can apply it in the morning and not worry about feeling sticky throughout the day.While the lotion is effective, I wish it had a more pleasant scent. It has a somewhat medicinal odor that might not be to everyone's liking. However, the scent dissipates fairly quickly, so it's not a deal-breaker for me.Sandoz Amlactin Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion is a fantastic choice for anyone seeking intense hydration and the added bonus of exfoliation. It has done wonders for my skin's texture, making it feel soft and smooth. The only minor downside is the fragrance, but the results definitely outweigh that. I highly recommend it to those in need of an effective daily moisturizing lotion.",
