                "reviewText": "Objectively this product is lovely, it goes on easy, the smell is kinda strong at first but fades quickly. It provides really good protection and if you're thicc like me even eases tight rub considerably.The bad news.A month into using this product and I suddenly had a massive full body reaction out of no where. I've been skin swatch tested before with inconclusive results. But this was undeniably an allergic reaction. I thought at first it may have been heat rash, sunscreen in my pores, the heat wave that came through out of nowhere, wasn't out of the realm of possibility. Except heat rash is supposed to go away on its own with minimal intervention. Needless to say this didn't. 90+ hours of excruciatingly painful and itchy skin later I caved. I set out for the walk in clinich where it was decided that it was an allergic reaction, and that I'd need topical and oral steroids and to load up on antihistamines till it passed. Only just on the mend now.If your skin is sensitive and you really want to try it, I honestly think you should consider it. Before I had a reaction it was my favorite product in my routine. I love this stuff and I'd give anything other then compromising my health to keep using it.On the other hand if you're like me and have reactive skin and go get patch testing and it comes up negative. If that feels wrong to you, get a second opinion. It isn't worth it to spend your whole life guessing and checking when this is a possibility.Good luck",

                "reviewText": "I have very fair skin and it is very difficult for me to tan in the summer. It doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m wearing sunscreen or not. This summer I walked every day and definitely got plenty of sun but my skin never tanned. I started using this product about a month ago and about a week later I realized that I had a tan line. It was amazing and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m just now finding out about this and I\u2019m 44 years old! I know it doesn\u2019t look that impressive in the pictures, but for this girl who never tans naturally, I\u2019m ecstatic! I recently went on a cruise and then walked three Disney amusement parks and applied it only once each of the days during my vacation. I never got a sunburn, ever! I\u2019ve been using it for a little while now and there is still plenty in the bottle. I apply about 3 to 4 pumps on each arm and each leg. And then some on my shoulders, chest and neck. I think it\u2019s definitely worth the price you pay because it is lasting a long time. I am amazed by the results as well. It has zero smell and it goes on easily and absorbs well. I really don\u2019t notice a discernible glow per se. Supergoop\u2019s dry oil Glow Stick is definitely better if you want a more noticeable glow. That being said, this is a product I will always buy now. Love it!",
