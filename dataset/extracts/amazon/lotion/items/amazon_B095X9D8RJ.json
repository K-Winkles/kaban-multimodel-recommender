The ingredients are good and safe. It is very hydrating. I have very dry skin and it does the job. The scent doesn't smell exactly like the body wash but it's ok. It's very subtle. If you put too much like i did the first time, it leaves a white cast but disapears after a few minutes. It's not oily and my skin absorbs it like crazy and it leaves my skin very soft. No more itchiness from dry skin. I ordered the orange scented one too and i like it also. I do recommend",
