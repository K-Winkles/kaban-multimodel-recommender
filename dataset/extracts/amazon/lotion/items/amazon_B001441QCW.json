                "reviewText": "We have been using this body lotion for years. The quality has not changed, which I appreciate. It\u2019s unscented and does not irritate sensitive skin or noses. It\u2019s thick, but not too thick, and a little goes a long way. Does not feel greasy and rubs in easily. This is a great lotion for the price (I would pay more for it, but don\u2019t tell).",

                "reviewText": "I have used this lotion for years and for me it's the top for quality and value. It doesn't have any real fragrance to speak of. The texture is thick and creamy and it goes on smoothly. I like to use it everyday directly from the shower. It leaves your skin feeling cleanly moisturized, you do have to work to rub it in fully but it only takes a couple of seconds and then there is no residue or stickiness once it's absorbed. It works great for me in both super dry and humid climates. No frills but a great everyday product.",

If you do not like shea butter, regardless of the almost zero scent, you will notice it. I use this lotion to extend the smell of my very expensive perfume collection and my perfume easily eliminates even the slightest hint of shea. This is a cheaper method rather than spending another $120 on the additional body lotion for my scents. If you want to be completely scentless (not possible/your body gives off a natural scent), avoid products with shea butter.",

The only problem is that it is too hard to release the pump valve which is locked upon delivery. Turning the head in the direction of the arrow does nothing. I had to open it and use a wrench to hold the inner grooved portion (covered in lotion) and then turn the pump head very hard. It only opened with brute force. Alba needs to re-evaluate their pumps and fix this problem.",

It moisturizes without any greasy feeling or shine. Can\u2019t recommend it enough. If you have sensitive skin or alcohol allergy like I do, this product is great.
