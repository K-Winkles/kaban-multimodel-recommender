If you have super dry skin and you\u2019re trying to fix an issue Im not sure this would be your best bet, however if you just need a daily moisturizer for normal skin this is it! You get so much product for the money, and like I said it smells absolutely amazing but it\u2019s not too powerful. I don\u2019t like when anything masks my purfume so this is good for that. It\u2019s lightweight and doesn\u2019t feel heavy or oily on my skin. I would definitely purchase again :)",

Pros: I like that the bottle isn\u2019t plastic. The lotion feels good going on and sinks in quick, not leaving you feeling greasy. You can\u2019t beat the price point. Cons: the Vanilla Musk scent smells very artificial and as soon as I put it on I had a reaction to the smell. I\u2019m not an allergic person but my eyes got itchy and my nose became stuffed up. I threw it out and won\u2019t be ordering this again.",

It wasn't dispensing lotion but I could tell there was at least 1/4 of the bottle left. I took the pump out and discovered that the tube is at least 2 inches short of the bottom of the container. I can't get the remainder of the product out easily, so its quite a waste. Very disappointing. The pump needs a simple redesign with longer tube.\u2026if you don't mind throwing away 1/4 of the bottle, this lotion is fine.UPDATE - I purchased another bottle of this lotion and it has a better pump. My first bottle was actually missing a piece of tubing. Not sure why the tubing would be in 2 pieces but it is.PS - the price on this lotion has TRIPLED since I purchased it on October 27th so sadly, I won't be buying it again at this new price.",
