I really like the scent, which is like a men's shampoo or fragrance - not too strong, but nice aroma. The lotion feels very luxurious and expensive, and it is kind of on the upper end of what I would normally spend for hand lotion, but it really works, and I don't have to use it nearly as often as I would have to use a cheaper lotion.I had a hard time opening the top the when I first received the bottle, and thought it was broken. It kind of was, but I was able to put it back together. I would have returned it otherwise, although the logistics of returning an open, broken bottle of lotion would have been tricky. Fortunately it worked out and I'm happy with my purchase. Highly recommended.",

It is a clean scent-maybe with some musk, that I find calming at bedtime, on my hands and elbows. It is practical for both of us and we take it on trips in the squeeze tube size, so we can both use it. The lotion is thick and absorbs completely in a minute or less. I recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "Some samples were sent to me and I decided to try them. I have edema in my lower legs, some due to age, and on one leg worse due to past injuries. I wear high boot socks, compression support and usually mid boots or hikers. My legs were drying out and the skin was flaking, severely on my injured leg.Within two days my skin was vastly improved and by day four all dryness and flaking was gone. Color improved too. Skin feels soft and normal. I use this everyday now.My better half, who is sensitive to this sort of thing, says that the scent is pleasant and that she likes it. The scent is not strong or overwhelming.It doesn't require much to get coverage, just quarter sized dabs for each lower leg. It does need to be rubbed in, both to be absorbed and to provide coverage. I have settled on the method of using smaller dabs and covering \"zones\". It sinks in or is absorbed fairly quickly, you want to spread it around right away. It is absorbed completely, it doesn't make a mess or stain your clothes. My boot socks show no traces and it washes off my hands completely with water.I have no reservations recommending people try it.I shopped around, no one beat Amazon's Add-in price with Prime delivery to the door. Thank you again Amazon and Prime.I have no relationship with Gold Bond or Amazon. Just appreciate good products and service.",
