                "reviewText": "I was looking for something nice on Prime Day and saw this lotion on discount! After reading that it has a non greasy finish on the skin, which is what turns me off from moisturizing in general, I figured to try it.It does smell like a watermelon candy, a bit too sweet for my liking. My nose gets used to it after awhile. But it DOES dry nice and nongreasy, which means a lot to me in a humid climate!I need this to get into the habit of moisturizing more without feeling like a slicked up seal. The smell is a bit sickly sweet, but the beauty of Hempz is that there's tons of different scents that they offer. I see a bunch at Ulta and I smell them time to time to see if their scent profiles differ. Feels a bit better than Bath and Body Works lotions since their nongreasy finish is a plus for me.It's been several months and I hadn't been keeping up with moisturizing, and my standard sized bottle is far from empty. I still look forward to trying a different scent. I keep it in my room since the hemp leaf image might bother my conservative family, BUT other than that, it literally smells like any other feminine lotion brand, but dries nicely, so it's a win for me!",

                "reviewText": "So far I really like the feel and smell of the lotion but it is very thin compared to most lotions. And so I find that I use a lot more. I have used it on my face instead of other lotions just to see if it makes any difference. But on my hands and arms which I lotion up at least twice a day I don't notice any difference, and it doesn't seem particularly moisturizing. So I'm glad I tried this, I love the coconut watermelon smell- and really to me it smells like fresh watermelon; I do know my fruits and I honestly don't smell the coconut - but I probably won't buy it again. I like something that you know you've put lotion on afterward. This is more for someone who doesn't want to feel like they just put lotion on within 5 minutes of using it . It actually surprised me because so many reviews claim that their skin got better and they felt that it was healing. I have found none of that to be the case. However anyone saying that this is an overpowering scent, I can disagree as far as the coconut and watermelon it's just a very light pleasant fragrance and dissipates within 30 minutes or so.",
