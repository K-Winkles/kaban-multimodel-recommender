She convinced me that I could use some too, and she was right. So, I've gotten used to using them, at least on occasion. The other day, I was shopping at a nearby grocery store and they had a variety of personal-use items packaged in very small portions. One of them was Jergens Ultra Healing lotion in a one-ounce tube. My thoughts were that this would be perfect for such activities as camping, or perhaps I might have a tube in my office desk drawer or my car's glove compartment. Viola!
