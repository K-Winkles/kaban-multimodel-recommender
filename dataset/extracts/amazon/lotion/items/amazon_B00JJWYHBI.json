                "reviewText": "I originally tried this lotion from the person who cuts my hair. I bought a bottle and went through it quickly. I have since bought many bottles of this product, all with different scents. This is one of my favorite scents so far. The best part is that it is not greasy like other lotions. I accidently got some on a shirt sleeve and changed the shirt because it had a wet spot. When I was ready to launder the shirt, the wet spot was GONE!!!!I happen to have neuropathy in my feet and this lotion works better than any of the other lotions I have used that are specifically made for diabetics or people with neuropathy. You have to take care of your feet every day and this is by far the best lotion to use. Feet stay soft and smooth all the time. The fact that it is non-greasy means I can put it on my feet and immediately put on my socks and shoes. And, the scent lasts and lasts. also, I put this on my feet when I go to bed and can keep my feet under the covers because it is non-greasy and does not stain my bedding. By the way, there is an Age Defying lotion from Hempz that I have. Great to put on the face as it is not greasy either. Try that one, too!!!! I am definitely a fan of this product, no matter what the scent and will continue to buy it before I run out of it! Can't live without it now!!!!",

                "reviewText": "I had been using the green tea version of this brand for maybe a year. (Which I loved.) I switched to the anti-aging one to try something new. I wasn't sure if this was the generic \u2018flavor\u2019 or if it was a fancy one - but I love it so much more than the green one! \ud83d\ude0dIt smells kinda like baby powder or something, but it\u2019s pleasant and only lasts maybe twenty minutes. So you won\u2019t have to worry about having any aromas from this.It\u2019s *very* thick and creamy! \ud83e\udd24 Lathers on really well and makes my skin softer than anything else I\u2019ve ever used\u2026! And the crazy part is it isn\u2019t even just the oils in the lotion that make my skin soft. Even after I shower it off my skin is genuinely healthier than it ever has been in my adult life. \ud83e\udd2f It also helps any small wounds heal rapidly. (I have cats that sometimes accidentally leave scratches when they\u2019re anxious, and I sometimes get blemishes.)I\u2019ve already recommended this lotion to all my friends and family. \ud83d\ude07",
