                "reviewText": "For almost $10 for only 12 oz. of lotion, I expected a lot better scent. The only reason I bought such an expensive lotion was because I have a sore on my arm called \"pityriasis rosea\" and it was recommended I specifically buy Aveeno brand to help it heal faster (takes almost 3 months to heal). The sore does look a little less red after 2 days, but I put it on my face as well as it feels very greasy (another reason to remove a star). However, I also put it on my arms where there are no sores, and my skin does feel soft. I love the scent of lavender but am very disappointed that the lavender scent disappears in about 5 minutes. Although it seems to already be helping my sore and my skin is soft, I would not buy this again for non-medical reasons because the scent is so weak and the price so high. With that said, however, I am very glad it is helping my sore so I would recommend it for that and if you have the money to spend, it is a nice, non-scented lotion.",

Glides from my hand and has better scent of lavender too from my perspective. So gentle on skin and I will definitely buy another once I am out on this one. Love the size.. it will probably last more than a year",
