The temperatures are getting steadily colder as winter approaches here in the Great Lakes region and that means extremely dry and chapped hands. I got the lotion to try to be productive. So far so good! Using a full pump is a bit too much since it gives enough lotion for hands and both arms. I recommend doing a \u00bc or \u00bd pump. Within a few minutes the lotion is absorbed leaving behind non greasy, soft, and perfume free hands.",
