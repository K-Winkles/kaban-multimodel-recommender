                "reviewText": "As someone who typically shies away from using lotion due to its heavy and greasy feel, I was initially hesitant to try the Queen Helene Cocoa Butter Hand and Body Lotion. However, after ordering a large bottle for both my husband and me, I can confidently say that I am pleasantly surprised by how much I love it. One of the first things that struck me about this lotion is its delightful scent. With every application, I feel like I've been transported to a serene beach setting, enveloped in the comforting aroma of cocoa butter. It adds a touch of luxury to my skincare routine and leaves me feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. What truly sets this lotion apart for me is its lightweight texture. Unlike other lotions I've tried in the past, this one absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving behind any greasy residue. I appreciate how effortlessly it spreads and how it doesn't weigh down my skin, allowing me to go about my day comfortably. Additionally, I've noticed that the Queen Helene Cocoa Butter Hand and Body Lotion provides ample hydration without feeling heavy or cloying. It leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth, and moisturized, without the need for constant reapplication throughout the day.I would highly recommend this lotion, especially for those with mature skin. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula makes it a joy to use, and the beach-like scent adds a delightful touch to the skincare experience. Overall, I'm thoroughly impressed with the Queen Helene Cocoa Butter Hand and Body Lotion and plan to continue incorporating it into my daily routine.",

                "reviewText": "There were so many great reviews that I wanted to try something new that is a good value and still has cocoa butter near the top of the list of ingredients. Other brands like Vaseline, Nivea, and other stores' brand list coconut and shea before cocoa extracts and smell like additives. I typically buy Palmers, and grew up using Palmers.Queen Helene has a pretty short ingredient list but there are 3 color dyes added including Red 40 - which is proven to cause migraines, hyperactivity, and behavioral changes like irritability and depression. Other countries require warning labels on products with Red 40! Also called: Red 40 Lake, FD&C Red No. 40, *Red 40 Aluminum Lake* <- listed in ingredients.This lotion is not as thick as other cocoa butter lotions I have tried so I don't feel like it is as hydrating but would be useful in warmer months to cut down on that sticky feeling. The smell is alright too.I would probably commit to a switch if they removed the red dye 40, which is unnecessary. I don't care what color the lotion is w/o dyes, if the ingredients and quality are good it doesn't matter.",
