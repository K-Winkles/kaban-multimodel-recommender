Not like those other moisturizers that you apply and literally 10 min later your skin is dry again. Plus the scent is not heavy, so I can wear my cologne without the moisturizer interfering with my cologne. I recommend for any one who has really dry skin like me. Use it everyday and everywhere face, body, hands, feet\u2026 it\u2019s a good product if you are looking for a new moisturizer.",

                "reviewText": "I tend to be allergic to a lot of products but this has been amazing for my skin. The scent is nice and light, pretty neutral. It\u2019s a great moisturizer, but it is thick - more of a cream to body butter consistency. A little goes a long way.I kind of wish they did sell it in tubs since it can be hard to get the product out after you\u2019re halfway through it and it has settled back down. To avoid the frustration we just store it upside down so it\u2019s always ready to squeeze.I hope they never change the ingredients. Been using this for 5+ years.",

It is very thick, however, so I transfer it to a jar and mix it with a small amount of water, to make it easier to spread on your skin. The stuff is so thick that it's impossible to get to the last few inches in the bottom of the container, so I have to cut the bottle in half and scoop out the bottom part with a case knife.",

For the longest time I refused to wear anything that expose my back because I was so conscious about how it looks.I've been using this lotion along with African black soap body wash and the results were astonishing. The spots on my back were faded and I haven't gotten any new bumps ever since I use them.The lotion is pretty thick, thicker than your typical lotion which I like. It goes on your skin very smoothy and it smells pretty nice. This product works and it works slowly so give it time to start working. It took me a whole bottle to see results that I'm happy with. I will continue to use it and I don't think I'll use anything else.",
