                "reviewText": "This is the 2nd best cream I've ever used. The BEST cream I ever used had the same consistency and smelled AMAZING. Unfortunately, it was discontinued a few years back so I\u2019ve been on the lookout for a replacement, trying various brands until I found one I liked. I'm always concerned about buying creams online as I don't have the opportunity to smell them, and I don't like to smell like anything edible or stinky, nor do I like greasy creams.Because of the low price and great reviews, I decided to give this Nivea one a try. I thought it was going to smell like chocolate like my cocoa butter stick, but it didn\u2019t. It has a very light, pleasant smell that dissipates quickly. It\u2019s creamy and thick and quickly absorbs into the skin, and doesn\u2019t feel or look greasy. It feels soooo luxurious (like an expensive cream) that it is a pleasure applying it. I wasn\u2019t one before to put cream on my hands every time I washed them, but now I do because I love how it feels when I slather it on my skin. I love it so much that when I work from home I\u2019ll apply it to my hands, neck, and face three or four times a day. The jar didn\u2019t say not to apply it on my face so I hope it is safe cause everywhere I\u2019ve applied it looks and feels AH-MAZING! My skin never felt so soft or looked better, and my skin doesn\u2019t look as crepey anymore. \ud83d\udcaf% recommend, and I hope you love it as much as me.",

I am not one to usually use lotion because I hate that oily greasy feeling when I don't feel like it did a thing after it soaked in. This stuff... first the price is amazing! The tub is HUGE! This soaks into your skin fast, no greasy feeling...and an hour later my skin looks and feels soft.",
