I hate my skin feeling sticky or greasy hours after it\u2019s applied. I hate feeling like I have a layer sitting on top of my skin even hours later.I also have sensitive skin, I can\u2019t do scented items or I get itchy/rashy and a lot of scents cause me to have a headache. And I didn\u2019t want something that caused me to break out. I\u2019ve had a really hard time finding a lotion to meet all my needs but this is it!My skin slurps this up in seconds! Truly! It absorbs so fast, by the time I\u2019m done spreading it over my body it\u2019s practically dry. Feeling my skin after application it is soft, but dry, no residue, no greasy layer, you can\u2019t even tell I put something on other than the fact the the skin is soft and no dry skin flakes. Perfect! I can put clothes on right away and not \u201cfeel\u201d the lotion because it has completely absorbed.",

I have very sensitive skin and this lotion doesn't make me itch, it absorbs into my skin right away with no sticky or oily feelings. It leaves my skin feeling very soft. I truly love the way Aveeno gets the job done. It has a faint scent, but it's not too much",

No tiene nada ultra especial como \u00e1cido hialur\u00f3nico o ceramidas, pero si tiene harina de avena que asumo ayuda a esta versi\u00f3n \"fresca\". Es una crema muy sencilla y b\u00e1sica que para lo que me cost\u00f3 en oferta ($176 mxn, $8.7 usd dlls), me pareci\u00f3 genial porque los productos sin: fragancia, aceites naturales, extractos naturales y otros irritantes, siempre son m\u00e1s caros.La considero una buena crema complementaria a mi bloqueador solar, pero no necesariamente una buena crema para usar en la noche, no obstante eso a\u00fan no lo compruebo.",
