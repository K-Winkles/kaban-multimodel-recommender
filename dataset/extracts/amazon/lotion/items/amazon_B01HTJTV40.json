        "description": "Made with Vaseline Jelly and Ultra-Hydrating Lipids, Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair Unscented Body Lotion for dry skin prevents dryness and helps keep your skin looking healthy and hydrated. With daily exposure to environmental triggers (like wind, lack of humidity, and sun), skin's natural moisture barrier can break down, allowing water to escape the skin. But the Ultra-Hydrating Lipids in our Advanced Repair Lotion fortify the skin barrier and replenish moisture to allow the skin's natural barrier to recover. Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair Unscented Lotion, formulated with Ultra-Hydrating Lipids and Vaseline Jelly, locks in moisture and repairs extremely dry skin. This unscented body moisturizer is clinically tested to provide 90% more moisture (vs. untreated skin). This lotion for dry skin absorbs fast for rich moisturization without feeling greasy and provides 48-hour moisture. Use this dermatologist-tested body lotion daily on dry, rough skin for stronger, noticeably healthier skin. Just apply to your skin for long-lasting moisture. This lotion bottle is made of 50% recycled plastic. Our ambition is to get to 100% recycled plastic in the near future. Since 2018, we've used 337 Metric Tons of recycled plastic across the Vaseline product portfolio in North America.",

                "reviewText": "I have tried multiple lotions and oils. My legs were so dry. I looked for a lotion that Vaseline made years ago that worked, but I couldn\u2019t find it. They came out with this lotion and it is great. My skin is so soft and hydrated. I love this lotion. It is perfect. It doesn\u2019t make my skin feel greasy, just soft. I bought four more bottles just so I wouldn\u2019t run out. I highly recommend this lotion, and I hope Vaseline never stops making this lotion.",

As soon as I turn the heat on in my house it becomes as dry as the Sahara Desert.I started using this lotion about a year or so ago, I believe it had different labeling but it's the same product. After using it my skin feels amazing and my wife even compliments me on how nice my skin looks and feels.I bought the 4 pack since I use it alot.",

                "reviewText": "My elderly parent's poor vision make it difficult for them to identify the side of the pump the lotion will come out of. This issue is, of course, exacerbated in lower lighting conditions. The wide surface of the top of the pump is very comfortable to the hand, but both sides are identical and it can be a challenge to know where the lotion will come out. Oh well, they usually guess correctly 50% of the time! Ha ha ha. I marked the opening side with a white paint pen to help.",

Since menopause, my skin is super dry all year not just in winter. I put it on at night & by morning my hands aren't dry. I re-apply in the morning. It's non-greasy & has no scent which I like. I bought this from Amazon because you can't beat the price! I bought ONE bottle of the same lotion at the drug store for $17.00 plus taxes. Amazon is selling them for 3 bottles for $20.00! I was skeptical so I ordered it just to see & YES, 3 bottles showed up & only billed me $20.00 for them. This might be a time limited deal but I'm not sure. Best cream ever!",

I never know what side the pump is on when I'm grabbing lotion... haha. It only comes out one side, but looks like both? I have been caught off guard a couple times.If you are looking for excellent moisturizing lotion, look no further. Just minus one star for lost product to the floor.",
