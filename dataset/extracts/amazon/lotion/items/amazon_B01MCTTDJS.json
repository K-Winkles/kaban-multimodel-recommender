It also does not seem as hydrating for me but I do have very dry skin . The price is nice and a fraction of the more expensive brand . Will I finish this bottle - yes. Would I purchase it again? - probably . Would I compare it to bum bum cream ? not a chance",

                "reviewText": "I was really excited to use this because I love coconut scents, but I\u2019ll get to that in a second. The product itself moisturizes nicely and isn\u2019t greasy, but takes a second to rub in on damp skin. If putting on dry skin, it rubs in just fine. I felt it made my skin really soft and helped any dryness. As for personal preference, this doesn\u2019t smell good. In the bottle, it smells REALLY good and has that amazing coconut scent but rubbed into the skin, I swear to God, it smells like tobacco-scented perfume. I cannot stand the smell and I wish I hadn\u2019t purchased this. My husband felt the same way when he smelled it in the bottle versus on skin. I\u2019ll finish this and top it with coconut body oil, but I definitely won\u2019t repurchase.",
