Yes, you may have noticed that we have updated our packaging to showcase our new & improved formula with Pro-Ceramide. This exciting change reflects our commitment to delivering high-quality products. You may receive either design for a short time. Did Lubriderm change their formulas? Yes, Lubriderm has made some exciting changes to enhance our products! We have improved our formulas including the addition of Pro-Ceramide, but don\u2019t worry-our lotions are still fast-absorbing with a clean, non-greasy feel. What is Pro-Ceramide and why is it important? Pro-Ceramide has been shown to penetrate within skin\u2019s surface layers and help support your skin\u2019s natural Ceramide levels. Ceramides play a role in helping maintain a healthy moisture barrier which helps retain moisture within your skin\u2019s surface. Is Lubriderm lotion safe for use on tattoos? Experts recommend using a water-based lotion to hydrate tattooed skin. Lubriderm Daily Moisture Lotion Fragrance Free is a gentle, water-based, unscented lotion that quickly absorbs and moisturizes for healthy-looking skin. Which Lubriderm lotion is best for winter skin? Dry, winter air coupled with heat indoors can lead to very dry skin. Intensely moisturizing products such as Lubriderm Advanced Therapy Moisturizing Cream Fragrance-Free replenish extra dry skin and help to restore your skin's moisture barrier.",

                "reviewText": "Our family has been using this lotion for years and highly recommend it. The lotion is unscented which is perfect for my wife's sensitive skin. She hastried many different lotions on her face and many of them make her break out in a rash around her eyes but she has never had a problem with this lotion. It's a little bit thicker consistency which is great for dry skin but it also does not leave a greasy residue on your skin. Would highly recommend if your looking for a fragrance free everyday lotion.",
