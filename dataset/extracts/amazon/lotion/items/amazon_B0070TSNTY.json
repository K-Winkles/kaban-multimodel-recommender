                "reviewText": "I'm loving this lotion! It was my first time trying this brand, but I decided to go for it based on the good reviews and the large size you get for the price. I especially love the scent. It's both coconut and lemon, without being too much so on either end of the spectrum and without having a synthetic or chemical tone to it. It smells very natural and although it's scented strongly enough to definitely enjoy it for awhile after applying, it's not overwhelming. It's got kind of a \"yummy\" scent to it, like a lemon/coconut cream cookie, but it's not sickeningly sweet or way too feminine like some lotions and creams I've tried. I will say that the scent probably falls a little more on the feminine side, but not in a flowery way. I'm sure many guys would also enjoy it. I know they have a cedar/citrus version for men too though if that's a concern.As for the lotion itself, it's light, but not runny, very hydrating, but not super thick. It absorbs extremely quickly and doesn't leave any oily or sticky residue. There also isn't any of that \"thick\" feeling layer where you can tell most of the product is just kind of sitting on top of your skin. This soaks right in. My hands get extremely dry in the Colorado winters and this is moisturizing enough to keep them feeling soft and smooth, but I don't have to wait for it to absorb or be left with oily hands. I even find myself reapplying it throughout the day as I pass my nightstand just to enjoy the yummy scent. I definitely recommend!",

                "reviewText": "EO's coconut-lemon lotion is by far my favorite year-round product. In the summer, spring, and most of fall, it makes for a great body lotion and thin face moisturizer is perfect for use right out of the shower. During the colder winter months, a thicker layer of this lotion is better as facial product, although for legs, hands and body it's still good, just maybe in need of an extra layering when the humidity and temperature really drop. I've tried both the orange mint and this scent, and the coconut-lemon is far superior (the mint is nice, but the mis with the orange is slightly off, although I happily used it as a leg lotion w/the coco-lemon as a face, arms and neck lotion). The smell is reminiscent of a lemon tart, and is the perfect barely-there everyday scent. Well worth the buy, and it seems to last forever! (each 32 fl oz. pump has lasted me at least a year).- Compared to other lotions: I've used Aveeno jars, Nivea bottles, and Jergens pumps in the past, but this is the one that is convenient to use right out of there shower, absorbs quickly, and leaves you feeling fresh and soft as opposed to greasy and bland. While not sufficient alone as a hand lotion when it's actually needed (dry, flaky, winter), it does live up to it's multi-use claim.-As for the actual pump container, it's extremely stable and doesn't fall over easily. When I have knocked it down from a sink or shelf, the plastic shows no damage and if anything, only a bit of lotion gets pumped out. The pump is VERY convenient, and only 2-3 pumps are needed for full-body coverage. (~1/4 pump for face)OVERALL:-great scent-lives up to 3-1 claim (only hand lotion aspect is semi-shaky)-great for warm months, good as base moisture for colder, drier months-good price/quality & quanity (lasts long, works well)-well worth it, especially in competition with more traditional brandsThis is my 3rd or 4th bottle of EO lotion, and I'll be sticking around for more.",

There are no garbage ingredients or poisons that the big manufacturers put in their products. Remember, your skin is a sponge and anything that you put on it is absorbed into your blood stream. It IS time to stop using poison products and start supporting companies that put together healthful products for us to use. The price is fantastic due to the amount that you get in the bottle and how long it lasts. I have calculated it to be about $ 3.00 dollars per month. you can't buy two bars of disgusting Irish Spring or Dove or any of the garbage soaps full of poison for that price. Here are a list of ingredients. I have used most scents of this product and my current infatuation is the Coconut and Lemon.
