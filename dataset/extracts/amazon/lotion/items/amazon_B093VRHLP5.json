Triggers can include cold weather, arid conditions, excessively hot or cold showers or hand washing, and even chronic conditions like diabetes. This fast absorbing lotion heals skin from the inside out, hydrating and drawing moisture into the skin with urea, a humectant that helps skin retain moisture and softens rough skin. It also contains 2% dimethicone, a known skin protectant that helps to seal in moisture. CETAPHIL Cracked Skin Repair Lotion provides daily maintenance for dry, cracked skin and is clinically proven to effectively protect, soothe and hydrate, leaving sensitive skin feeling softer and smoother. 100% of users felt cracked skin was softer and more moisturized after use. Tackle sensitive skin with the help of CETAPHIL. A weakened skin barrier lets more water out while letting irritants in, both of which can lead to dryness and sensitivity. By strengthening and reinforcing the skin barrier, CETAPHIL skin care products defend against 5 signs of skin sensitivity - dryness, irritation, roughness, tightness and a weakened skin barrier.",

I was very diligent about using this every night for 2 weeks and saw an amazing transformation. It is a little greasy but I did apply it very liberally. There is no heavy scent. I now apply it every other day to maintain the results. I highly recommend this!",

It does not have a scent to clash with my perfume and works well in that regard for men as well. It takes a little while to absorb but leaves my skin so soft and healthy feeling. It spreads easily. I hate really thick lotions that take forever to spread and go on white like paste. This will not do that!",

This Cetaphil lotion after some time my cracked skin starts to really hurt and only feels better after applying this lotion again or the Eucerin healing cream. My skin never hurts when I use the healing cream though even when my skin dries out",
