                "reviewText": "Ok, so I first tried this Gold Bond Radiance Renewal Ultimate Hydrating Lotion last year when the pandemic had us washing our hands many times a day through the winter. I worked in a lab, and the gloves were drying my hands even worse. One of my co-workers let me try this stuff, and it was amazing!!! It instantly brought moisture to my dry, cracking skin, and it wasn\u2019t greasy! I actually said, \u201cWow, oh, my gosh, look!!!\u201d It instantly brought life back to my dry hands, and it didn\u2019t hurt to move them because they were so chapped any more. It was instantly better.I bought my own bottle here, and it\u2019s still amazing! If you need to put on latex/nitrile gloves after using this lotion, you can do it, because it doesn\u2019t make you greasy. It\u2019s amazing, and I believe that I will use this stuff to the last drop! Seriously, any other lotion I\u2019ve tried makes your hands sticky or greasy, but this does none of that. This stuff is the best. You have a slightly silky touch after using it. It\u2019s nourishing. If you use it on your legs, your legs don\u2019t stick to your pant legs, either. I tried it! Perfect product\u2026Also, I hate scents in any lotion. This has a very slight smell. It smells a tiny bit like coconut. That\u2019s not bad! Natural is the best.I was asked to rate how easy it is to spread. It\u2019s not quite as easy as other lotions to spread. It is dense, and if you\u2019re looking to spread it over hairy arms, you will need a comb. Either that, or you could spread it on your slightly wet body after a shower/bath. I think that would solve the difficulty spreading issue. I think that it absorbs into the skin so nicely. The skin does not look oily after rubbing it in. I think the formulation is a real winner.",

                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying that all the gold bond lotions that I've tried have been pretty freaking fantastic. What makes this one my favorite is that other only does it make my skin soft and shiny but it smells heavenly! Often times in thw summer months I don't use body sprays or perfumes so this lotion is ideal as it smells delicious and gives my skin the moisture it needs. My ONLY complaint is that when I near the end of every bottle, I have to literally cut them open with a knife and scoop out what remains with a spatula because it's so thick. Seriously, if you do this you'll see that SO MUCH is being wasted by simply tossing it away when the pump stops working. I get at least 1/2 cup of this lotiony goodness by slicing and scraping what's otherwise left behind. I am not overly fond of plastic jars for healty and beauty products but in this case I would prefer it. The thickness of this lotion is wonderful but it really requires different packaging to avoid serious waste.",

                "reviewText": "So I\u2019ve been looking for a decent lotion for the past couple of years. After trying multiple brands and getting lackluster results, semi dry hands with multiple applications, I used some of my cousins Gold Bond while out visiting. Put it on just once and my hands actually felt soft and smooth for hours. As long as there are no changes in quality, I\u2019ll be going with GB from here on out. This lotion goes on nice and thick, gives relief as soon as I put it on, and looks as if it will last for quite some time.",

                "reviewText": "Gold Bond Radiance Renewal Hydrating Lotion offers a remarkable solution for visibly dry skin, with just a minor caveat to consider. Here\u2019s the breakdown:\ud83d\udca6 Hydration: The lotion lives up to its name, providing long-lasting hydration that significantly improves the appearance of dry skin. The effects are visible, giving skin a renewed and healthy radiance.\ud83d\udc6a Family Size: The 20 oz. size is quite generous, making it suitable for family use. It\u2019s great to have a skincare product that can be shared among family members without fear of running out quickly.\ud83d\udc86 Skin Feel: The lotion absorbs quickly, leaving skin feeling soft, smooth, and non-greasy. It\u2019s a pleasant experience that makes you want to reach for the lotion regularly.However, there\u2019s a slight area of improvement:\ud83d\udc43 Scent: While not overwhelming, the fragrance of the lotion is a bit distinctive and might not appeal to everyone. It\u2019s not a deal-breaker, but it could be a factor for those sensitive to scents.In conclusion, Gold Bond Radiance Renewal Hydrating Lotion earns a solid 5 stars \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50. It delivers excellent hydration for visibly dry skin, and despite the unique scent, its benefits far outweigh this minor issue. It\u2019s a worthy addition to your skincare routine if you\u2019re looking to rejuvenate your skin\u2019s radiance.",
