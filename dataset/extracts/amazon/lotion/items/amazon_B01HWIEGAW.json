                "reviewText": "I love O'Keefe's Skin Repair Body Lotion. for Extremely Dry Skin Relief. It does amazing repair work on the skin overnight. And in the day time. And I can feel that it is still working even after I wash my hands. Also I touched my face accidently at night time with the lotion because I had fallen asleep before I smoothed it onto my hands. And I didn't break out in pimples. My face reacts really quickly to oils of any kinds in a really bad way. I was too tired to get up from my sleep at night and clean my face. And surprisingly in the morning time there was no major damage to the skin on my face. I have not seen this yellow O'Keefe's lotion bottle in the store. Which is unfortunate because it is a really great product. It has no smell really. And it soon sinks into the skin and almost evaporates. Leaving only a slight moisture on your skin. Not greasy although. That is the reaction that I have had with my skin. It is worth a try for anyone who is searching for a good skin repair lotion for their hands and body. For my face I use Vitamin E Oil 75,000 IU from Bella Terra. But this is ideal for the rest of the body.",

Both are unsented which I need for my health. The company sent me the wrong one twice they ,sent me the cream so I've decided to try it and I may like it even more, a little heavy at first before absorbing, and a little like a base with baby oil but soaks in prety quick and first try seemed to last longer , penateated deeper. The picture here is the lotion, the more solid yellow is the cream. Evidently the company person that pulled to ship is colored blind and cannot read English. They shipped the wrong one twice and want to know what's wrong with it. The item numbers would be different just like color of tube and writing on it.",
