I use to use suave, but that stop working for me because after using it my skin was left feeling dry, so that's when I decided to use Jergen which I've been using ever since. I have no complaints because not only is it moisturizing it smells very good. Lastly the bottle lasts for weeks so it's worth the price.",

Came in a set of 3 and only got 2. This looks like it happened during transit, which reflects dishonesty with customs. Very sad and disappointed. Do not know about the longevity as yet as I will begin to use my lotion as of this weekend.",
