There are an awful lot of lotions that contain mineral oil and I always have to read labels before using a new lotion.I've tried lotions from the lotion specialty stores, and while they smell nice, they really don't seem to moisturize very well. I'd rather buy a quality lotion that moisturizes my skin and doesn't smell like perfume and get my scent from a scent product.I've come to only use this Nivea lotion. The firming doesn't contain mineral oil, though the regular lotion does. Is this lotion a magic skin firming potion? No. But I've been using it quite a while and I do think my skin it holding up pretty well for my age. It moisturizes well and that is what lotion is supposed to do. The moisturizing will help keep my skin firm. I am sticking with this product.",

This absorbs quickly and keeps my legs, which I shave daily, smooth and silky, without bumps, redness or itching. All of which are a problem with every single other body lotion I try, but not if I use this Nivea once a day. I've done the oh-so-great-smelling Bum Bum Cream, organic lines at 5x the price that others rave about and, every single time, I come back to this Nivea Firming. Reasonably priced, works fantastic and probably the beauty/skincare product I've been loyal to the longest.Does it firm? Eh, not really. I mean, well hydrated and cared for skin is going to look somewhat firmer by definition, but this isn't going to make cellulite vanish\u2014mostly because that's not a thing any lotion can do.If you said I could have one dessert island beauty product, this drugstore lotion would seriously probably be the one. Yes, it's that good. Not fancy, but absolutely gets the job done, better than anything else I've tried.",

                "reviewText": "This stuff has really surprising results. My skin is noticeably softer and firmer after only a few days of use. My face is brighter, my hands are softer, and my cottage cheesiness is firmer.I have lost quite a bit of weight (50 pounds and counting) so my skin needs some tightening and toning - this stuff does just that. I also have extremely dry skin in the winter over my whole body and this helps with that as well.I use the \u201cstronger\u201d version of this lotion, the gel-cream (on the left in the picture), for my stomach, thighs, and butt. I then use the lotion (on the right) for my chest, arms, hands, and face/neck.It also smells great, not too strong but still a delightful smell. My only complaint, and reason for taking off one star, is that it does leave my skin sticky for an hour or so after application. Other reviewers didn\u2019t seem to have that problem so I\u2019m not sure why I do - I usually apply shortly after showering so I know my skin is clean, but still leaves it sticky. Even so, I would still recommend cuz the results are well worth it. P.S. the gel-cream does not leave any stickiness, it\u2019s great!",
