I didn\u2019t understand the hype at first but I always gravitated towards lotions that had a scent without realizing it wasn\u2019t for me in many ways. This lotion is truly fragrance free and is super easy to massage into your skin. Plus, it leaves a healthy glow that isn\u2019t greasy or irritating. It seems strange but I just smell like\u2026. Me???? Love, using this forever",
