Well, after about 5 hours and only one application they really feel smooth and soft - even after washing them a few times. I read a few people complaining about the scent. It's actually a very light scent and smells kind of sweet like ice cream. I can't wait to try using it on other parts of my body, and hopefully it will help with my old lady neck. Even if it doesn't, I really like how soft it makes my skin feel!",

The Glycolic Acid was is invigorating, especially since our days are always hot. The lotion is light weight but you still feel it's effectiveness because your skin is so smooth and soft afterwards..not to mention adding a few pumps of the booster to it..and it went to another level of moisture on my skin. I'll be a customer forever! Try these products y'all..they're magnificent \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude0c",

However, if I pretend it doesn\u2019t smell so terrible, so far I like it. Very hydrating and soaks in with no residual residue. Hopefully I can tolerate the scent long enough to see if it works to lighten dark spots ( the reason I purchased this was to lighten the dark skin patches on my thighs) I will update this review in time and let you guys know how it goes. The scent does get a little bit better when it dries and isn\u2019t as overpowering as when just applied\u2026 but it still lasts and smells terrible. If it lightens the dark spots I won\u2019t be mad at it anymore. Will definitely be back with an update.",

                "reviewText": "I am obsessed with this entire line of lotions!!!Because the reviews for all the different types are together I\u2019m going to highlight them all here as I have tried and loved every single one of them.For background on me. I\u2019m 60 but take good care of myself and people usually think I\u2019m 10-15 years younger than I am. I do have some age \u201ctells\u201d though that if you look closely would give my age away. And these lotions are making those go away. I have spent tons of money over the years and am a product junkie and I\u2019ve never found anything that works better on my face - yes my face(!) or my body than Medix 5.5 lotions.Collagen and Peptides lotion is the one that started my love affair with this brand. All the lotions are loaded with dimethicone which fills in all the lines and plumps skin and it is amazing. Spackle for skin. Anyway after just a few days my reasonably deep forehead lines (age tell) are way less deep. Noticeably. I\u2019ve taken such good care of myself I don\u2019t expect to turn back the clock at all - I\u2019m happy just slowing it down - but those lines are better. Also my skin is baby butt smooth and any alligator lines are gone. There isn\u2019t really a smell aside from the normal lotion smell. This stuff is amazing!! Do not be afraid to use these on your face. The ingredients are safe, gentle and effective.I tried the retinol lotion. Now I\u2019m actually very allergic to retinol but I\u2019ve only used it on my face and I figured in a body lotion surely it\u2019s not too strong. Well I put it on my body at night (retinol and sunlight don\u2019t mix and I\u2019m a Florida girl) and woke up needing a benedryl. There\u2019s a good amount of retinol in there. Lol. No bad smell and I wish I could use this on my face but I do skim it on my legs lightly once a week or so.Hyaluronic acid and cica extract. Ok watch out for this one. This smells strongly of rose. And it doesn\u2019t go away. I love hyaluronic acid to hold in hydration but the smell is way too strong for me. Medix has a booster that has no odor and can be mixed in and I prefer that. I am using this up by applying it before I shower and then rubbing it in with the water and showering as usual. But this one I\u2019ll probably pass on next time.Argan oil and Vitamin E is another solid basic lotion. Smells like lotion and hydrates well. This one is also great.Vitamin C and Turmeric is a great lotion but it does smell strongly and body spray doesn\u2019t cover the smell. But it works like it should so I will keep using this one (only at night because Vitamin C and sunshine don\u2019t mix either). So this one has helped a lot with my brown spots on my hands and chest (another tell). I haven\u2019t used it too much out of love for my husband sleeping next to me but I can see a difference.Coconut oil and manuka honey - this one smells fabulous! Like the best coconut tropical suntan lotion but it\u2019s not overpowering and sadly it fades quickly. The lotion is good just like all of them although I don\u2019t think it makes as big an impact as some of the others.Hope this helps. I cannot say enough good things about these lotion!!",

It drastically reduced how wrinkly my stomach looks in like a week and a half. I have also ordered the Argan in the orange bottle to try. These lotions absorb nicely without leaving a feeling of residue. The smell doesn't bother me either. This won't get rid of my excess skin, but it definitely makes it look firmer and less ugly.",

After a lot of different creams etc this one works.Used it twice a day for first week then at least once a day thereafter it feels really nice on the skin and any stickiness\u2019s goes of very quickly only been applying it to arms at firstnow going to use on legs and neck etc.This is not as expensive as other products I have used so was unsure about buying it after several failures this is worth every penny.",
