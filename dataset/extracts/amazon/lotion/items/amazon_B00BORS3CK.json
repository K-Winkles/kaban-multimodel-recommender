I switched to creams a couple of years ago because most store bought lotions just don\u2019t cut it when it comes to being moisturizing past a couple of hours. This lotion beats any brand name lotion I\u2019ve ever purchased, hands down. I\u2019m pleased with my purchase. I will be trying other scents.",

I\u2019m glad to have found a product I like that supports an American small business. Vanilla is my go to scent, but I\u2019m very tempted to try others, especially since they are priced so reasonably.",

                "reviewText": "Alright - where to even begin.I'm a 73-year-old man who uses a variety of moisturizing body lotions. I've always enjoyed the smell of vanilla - whether in after-shave or hand/body cr\u00e8mes. The reference standard in body cr\u00e8mes that I had used for years was that from the C Booth company that made a 32 ounce container of Vanilla Butter cr\u00e8me that set the standard for both its moisturizing abilities and for the longevity of the vanilla smell (which was most of the day).Since C. Booth is no longer making this cr\u00e8me (a shame really), I had to look for other options. You may still be able to find these 32 ounce C. Booth vanilla butter formulations, but they are going for ridiculous money (again, if you can find them) for anywhere from $65 to $100, which is ridiculous - such was the popularity of this cr\u00e8me formulation.I eventually came across this Lotion Company Vanilla Bean cr\u00e8me and had to give it a try. Now right off the bat, the vanilla smell is not as engrained in this formulation as the vanilla butter was in the C. Booth version. However, right now, this formulation (Lotion Company) is one of the better vanilla formulations on the market, and I'd say that the scent lasts around a half day or so.As for the moisturizing capabilities of this cr\u00e8me, it is outstanding. I use it on my arms and legs, and it keeps them soft and moisturized all day long. I love it.",

                "reviewText": "After my normal lotion was discontinued (Vera Bradley Vanilla Sea Salt), I started my hunt for a new product and have ordered multiple vanilla scented lotions. For a while the EOS vanilla cashmere was my preference but the vanilla scent is somewhat muted in that one. I bought this with relatively low expectations and now I've bought it 3 times in the last week because my teenage daughter loves it just as much. The vanilla scent smells natural, the moisturizing properties last for a decent amount of time and the skin feel wasn't overly oily, plus it's made in the USA!! If you are looking for a good vanilla scented lotion for daily use, you won't be disappointed with this one.",
