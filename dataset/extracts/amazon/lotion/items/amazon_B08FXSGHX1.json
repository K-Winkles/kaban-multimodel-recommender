It is not sickly sweet and the feeling after applying the lotion mixed with body oil is luxurious. skin is left so soft and it last all day. I like to use this as a perfume laying combo. It pairs well with Vanilla Woods buy 7 Virtues, Vanilla 28 by Kayali and the Arabian pink perfume named Qissa. I will be repurchasing this and I will also try the other scents as well.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this as an afterthought when buying the quinoa scent, which was amazing!I like vanilla and lemon so I thought this would be a nice scent. While it's not bad, it's definitely boring. The vanilla is very lacking and the lemon, well, .... what lemon? I think if I imagine lemon, I might smell it, but I really have a hard time finding that in this one.The formula is very moisturizing but doesn't leave skin greasy or sticky. This brand doesn't break put my upper arms like most do & the scents have been mild yet noticeable but not overwhelming. I feel like I can definitely layer perfume or body spray on over the lotion and neither is competing. I'll definitely buy the brand again but probably not this scent. It's just underwhelming.Update - plum scent:The plum scent is really terrible. It's listed as smelling like plum & peach but it doesn't smell like either. So far, the best scent has been the quinoa. If you like a warm scent like cashmere & a hint of vanilla without an overpowering scent that gives you a a headache, that's the one. The scent of the plum is so strong, I can't even get it off though I used a partial pump & washed it off right away! Now I smell like an old lady with way too much fruity musk perfume on. Definitely sending this one back. I kept the shea & used it on my legs. I gave away the rose. It smelled like old fashioned tea rose perfume. I love the quinoa & the plum is really reminiscent of an old bottle of old lady perfume bottle you'd find in a thrift store. Just so bad & almost soapy smelling.",
