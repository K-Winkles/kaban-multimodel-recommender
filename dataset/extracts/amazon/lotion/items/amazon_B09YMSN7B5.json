                "reviewText": "I use it mostly on my hands and neck. It feels light and very comfortable and it has no scent which is great for those who are sensitive to that. For the price and the amount you get for a body lotion that have great ingredients including retinol and vitamins i say its worth the try and see how much improvement it gives to the look of your hands and/or neck. I havent used it on my other parts of my body since im using a diff product with retinol on my face. They also ship it with tape on the opening so it wouldnt spill out which is great.",

It glides on fast and smooth BUT there is one issue I have with this amazing lotion. THE SMELL. It smells like smoked meat from a fair. I'm not sure if other people would agree but every time I put it on, I feel like I just ate some smoked meat. However, it's OK with me because I can always put another layer of my favorite scented lotion on top. But this is such a great lotion, I will keep purchasing it !!!!!!!",

But they don't state what retinol concentration actually is (few if any brands do). Still, applying at night leaves my skin softer next day - more so than other creams. Can't say I've seen any firming effects beyond what any moisturizer might do. But I haven't taken photos or used regularly enough to expect significant improvements. That said, for the price and the general improvement in my skin's moisture, I'll continue to use it.",

It moisturizes well, but it can sting on the thinner skin of the d\u00e9colletage, neck, and face, so fyi. After this one was used up I purchased Versed\u2019s retinol body lotion and I prefer that one. It\u2019s less creamy, thinner like a daily body lotion, no sting, and the moisturizing ingredients are really nice and soothing. So this is a decent deal for the price but I probably won\u2019t buy it again.",
