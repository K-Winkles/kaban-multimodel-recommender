This is my cream of choice! The intensive formula is thick and makes my skin feel soft. The only negative about this product is that it has mineral oil in it which is very bad for cats. I have to be very conscious to put pants on after I use it if I'm going to feed her as she rubs against my legs and I don't want her to lick the cream off of her fur. I'm sure that I could use something else that's mineral oil free but I like this product enough to use it mindfully.",
