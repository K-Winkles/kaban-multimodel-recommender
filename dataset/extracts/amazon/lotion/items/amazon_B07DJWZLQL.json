                "reviewText": "Ah, hyaluronic acid, ye mystical humectant. You can cost $9 for a big ole bottle, as with this Neutrogena Hydro boost or, next over on the list, product X is ching-chinging in at $35. I have long thought, What gives? The other selling point for me was that it's either oil free or nearly so, so it might be a winner in summer months in the perspiration-avoidance department. I'm normally a scent-free shopper but a number of reviews, including a dermatologist on YouTube, claimed the texture of the scented was nicer. The scent is in the citrusy department rather than the vanilla or overripe apple department--which would have compelled me to re-gift it. Plus the scent dissipates fairly quickly.The ingredient list requires a chemistry background but that was expected with a big box store type of brand. And I should note that the famed hyaluronic acid is the last ingredient listed, whereas the world's most beloved and used humectant (water-attractor), glycerin, is the second listed ingredient after, uh, water. I buy glycerin by the gallon and use it as a lotion daily. People in olden times always used plain glycerin. I don't know why folks have seemingly forgotten about it. It's in 98% of cosmetics.So, this stuff goes on really smooth, it soaks in instantaneously, whereas plain glycerin will sit around a bit until you rub it in.There is definitely something to all the cheering about the disappearance of crepey skin. I'm not a youngster. My skin is in great condition for my age (thanks, glycerin!) but I'm starting to crepe in a few spots, or something new and weird is going on. This lotion does have a positive effect. It also makes your skin feel cooler than normal to the touch and somehow plump--in a good way. And after the summer of '23, it's a go-to in steamy weather.As for sensitive skin, I do have something like eczema on my elbows and this lotion doesn't irritate but most lotions don't. I don't think I'm a good judge for the sensitive skin factor.So, no idea what ingredient is doing what, if the hyaluronic acid is the hero, or if it all boils down the the glycerin, but I've been impressed.",

I never have that slimy lotion feel. I have recommended or bought this for several family members, now they are all hooked. It really works very well!!!",
