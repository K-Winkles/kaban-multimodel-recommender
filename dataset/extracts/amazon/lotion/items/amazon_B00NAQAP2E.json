I don\u2019t really notice any lingering smell, but my skin is grateful for the calming effect it has especially on my dry itching hands. I\u2019ve gone through too many lotions which promise to moisturize and soothe but don\u2019t deliver. This lotion is not cheap but in the end saves me money because I only need 1 product that actually works and I don\u2019t need to keep searching and and paying for disappointing products. If your skin is like mine, I happily recommend this soothing, creamy light lotion.",

                "reviewText": "Hear me out! I swear this stuff keeps mosquitoes away from me. First used it at a hotel in Austin. The mosquitoes in the courtyards were pretty bad. One morning, I lathered this on me before going out for coffee. We brought it back to the outdoor seating area and I could see a lot of mosquitoes just hovering around. They bit my partner but not me. And I'm a mosquito's favorite dish usually. Looking at the ingredients I suspect it's the amount of citrus. Now, I'm not saying you should take this deep into the Amazon (no pun intended) but try it at your next back yard bbq. Curious if its just a fluke or if I'm onto something here. I think it smells like fruitloops in a good way.",

                "reviewText": "First found this while flying Delta. Love the scent, which is a faint lime/citrus, and the way it moisturizes without leaving a greasy feel.Also, it's the most efficient moisturizer I've used. A little goes a long way. For instance a dime-sized drop can moisturize the full length of both my arms...and I live in hot dry climates like Sacramento and Las Vegas!The only reason I didn't give it 5-stars is because it doesn't come in larger bottles. The largest size is only a little over 8 oz. If they had a 13 oz or even 16 oz, that would be perfect! Thank you Malin & Goetz for your great product.",
