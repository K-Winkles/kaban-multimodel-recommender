Gives you a clean and pampered feel). Absorbs well, hydration lasts throughout the day and a little goes a long way. Second is the value; very reasonable price for the size and quality. Third is the packaging; I love that this doesn\u2019t come with a pump that never seems to work. If you\u2019ve got arthritis in your hands as I do, you\u2019ll appreciate the shape of the bottle which is easy to squeeze. The shape also makes it convenient to throw in a tote, gym bag, etc. Also appreciated are the simple, yet stylish, graphics on the bottle itself that blend in with any decor. Plus it\u2019s nice to know I\u2019m not paying extra for someone else\u2019s idea of a fancy looking bottle.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a new lotion since my previous try at a new lotion felt like I slapped butter on my body. This method daily lotion smells quite nice and doesn't leave a greasy residue or feel after applying. It absorbs into the skin fast, but I wouldn't say it's super moisturizing. I have pretty dry skin, especially in the winter and with the colder months here, I wouldn't switch out my usual Nivea lotion for this one. While I do enjoy the soft, rose scent, the moisture factor could use some work, but it's not heavily marketed for dry skin so I wouldn't fuss too much over that. It is, however, marketing to moisturize for at least 24-hours and I feel like if you have pretty normal skin, it would work for you. Overall, would utilize as my 'scent' lotion, but not as my 'moisturizing-out-of-the-shower' lotion.",
