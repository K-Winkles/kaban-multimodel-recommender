        "description": "Vaseline Intensive Care Calm Healing Lotion calms, soothes and restores dry skin with a light lavender scent. This body lotion, formulated with Lavender Extract, helps keep your skin looking healthy and hydrated. With daily exposure to environmental triggers (like wind, lack of humidity, and sun), skin's natural moisture barrier can break down, allowing water to escape the skin. The Ultra-Hydrating lipids in our lotion for dry skin fortify the skin barrier and replenish moisture to allow the skin's natural barrier to recover. This lotion locks in moisture and promotes smooth, naturally glowing skin. The body moisturizer is clinically tested to provide 90% more moisture (vs. untreated skin). This body lotion for dry skin absorbs fast for rich moisturization and provides moisture all day long. Use this dermatologist-tested body lotion for dry skin daily on dry, rough skin for stronger, noticeably healthier skin. Just apply to your skin for hydrating relief. This Vaseline lotion bottle is made of 50% recycled plastic. Our ambition is to get to 100% recycled plastic in the near future. Since 2018, we've used 337 Metric Tons of recycled plastic across the Vaseline product portfolio in North America.",
