                "reviewText": "I was skeptical about buying this lotion because of the negative reviews I read. I am so happy I did, the size is decent and honestly perfect for traveling which I do every single day. There's nothing more annoying than lugging around a 12 oz lotion with you in your purse. Aside of the good size for traveling, the scent is so refreshing. In my opinion it's more of a grapefruit than it is raspberry but it's so delicious. If you enjoy the scent sweet pea from Bath and Body Works, you'll definitely like this scent. Now to review the actual product, it is extremely moisturizing and I am a die hard lotion fanatic. I am using lotion after every single time I was my hands. My hands naturally get pretty dry especially after I do my hair every morning and expose my skin to different hair products. Even using a dime size amount was enough to fully moisturize my hands. This lotion itself is very soothing for my skin and this little bottle will definitely last me considering what little amount you need. I always saw the bigger bottles at Ulta and never purchased them because of the price and I was never able to try this brand until now. I now understand the price, its quality lotion and with such an amazing refreshing scent. Not for nothing, I received the product 2 days after I ordered it and I could not be happier!!",
