Then when I was getting a tribal arm band while I was pro wrestler (they called me Ripper John). I rubbed this on my bicep and the tattoo showed up. Now that I\u2019ve got tough guy tattoos. Ya know fingers and necks. This works on those too. What ever the fad this works on all tattoos.Except infinity symbols. This product will make infinity symbols fall out.",
