After almost hitting 40 years of age I've decided to start using lotion as my skin is starting to become dry and less supple. This definitely helps stop flaking skin! However, I don't know if this is how lotion is supposed to feel, but using this lotion gives me this feeling of having a \"film\" over my skin. Its not oily per se, but its just this smooth layer that makes me feel like its not my skin. Its very smooth tho! Not a huge fan of the scent, but it dissipates pretty quickly.",
