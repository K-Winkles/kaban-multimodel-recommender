I'm the same way - I've always got some sort of job to do. This moisturizer goes on very easily, is absorbed quickly and smells beautiful. It keeps my skin nice and soft, especially during the winter when our house tends to feel very dry. It was built in the 1880's and the walls have horsehair plaster on them, which sucks up all the moisture. I keep a bottle of it in the kitchen, bathrooms(we have 2) and in the bedroom. I never let it run out. My order arrived very quickly and packaged to prevent damage during shipping. I can't say enough good things about it or the vendor. I'll definitely buy from them again. I highly recommend this for dry skin - you won't be sorry.Linneaann",
