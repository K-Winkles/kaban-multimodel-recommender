                "reviewText": "This lotion for its value is a S T E A L!! Why? Let me explain.I have a whole host of skin issues due to having sensitive skin. I have KP, Hyperpigmentation, Scarring, Acne, Chronic Dryness, etc. This lotion has helped me with all of those things and its ingredients are very good for you!- It doesn't have any Silicones which can clog your pores depending on your skin type or how often you lotion inbetween showers and if you use soaps that have sulfates to dissolve the silicones; so if you have a Sulfate Free bath routine; this lotion is a MUST to avoid silicones but still have super hydrated and soft skin.- The hydration literally lasts all day or sometimes almost 2 days.- The smell is a nice fresh Coconut scent; but it's light enough if you want to change up and DIY it into a scent you'd accept more; buy some lotion fragrance oils and mix a few drops in. I added Birthday Cake and Chocolate-scented drops into my Value Size bottle, so now it smells heavenly!- It (unintentionally) brightens and lightens your skin slowly over time. This lotion has a lot of brightening ingredients in it; I'm not sure if Palmer's knew that or if they used these ingredients for their other great factors and nutrients to the skin. But my KP and body scars are slowly starting to fade with the consistent use of this lotion.Here are some very minor Cons of the lotion:- It is a very heavy and thick lotion that WILL hydrate your life better than a hot date on a Saturday night. Because of this, it's great as a winter, fall, and spring moisturizer, but summer? Use it sparingly or try not to go too heavy with it! You'll feel lubed up for dayssss. Unless you like that sorta thing~- I saw people complain about the smell. I personally don't mind the mild scent of Coconut. However, I am a Gourmand queen and I love smelling like I got dipped in chocolate, nutty, cookie batter goodness. Like in my Pros section above. Just add some fragrance oils meant to be added to lotions and spruce it up a bit! Be sure to patch test as you mix to make sure your skin won't be irritated. I recommend taking out a bit of lotion and mixing it separately and see how it fairs with your skin before committing to transforming your whole bottle.All in all. I L O V E this lotion, and nothing will separate it from me. It's a keeper~",

                "reviewText": "Palmer's Coconut Oil Formula Body Lotion is my absolute favorite lotion. It provides deep hydration and leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft and nourished. The coconut oil-infused formula has a delightful tropical scent that instantly transports me to a beachside paradise. I especially appreciate how it quickly absorbs into my skin without feeling greasy, making it perfect for daily use. It has been a lifesaver during dry, winter months and has significantly improved the overall texture and moisture levels of my skin. Palmer's Coconut Oil Formula Body Lotion is a skincare must-have, and I highly recommend it to anyone in need of intense hydration and a delightful fragrance.",

My mum always had the stick of Palmers cocoa butter. This coconut oil formula with green coffee smells wonderful, warm & rich. My husband wants one lotion for his face and body and he loves this. I love it too. It\u2019s economical, nourishing, smells beautiful and complements my warm perfumes.",

I found out later that I can purchase it for half the price at Walmart. But I also saw that is comes in a much larger bottle for $39.99, which I would buy in an instant on this website.You won't be sorry if you purchase it.",
