                "reviewText": "I've used Eucerin lotion for years, and let me tell you, it's been my steadfast companion in the battle against dry skin. As I age, I've noticed my skin becoming even drier, but thankfully, this lotion continues to be an effective solution for me.One of the features I appreciate most about this lotion is how quickly it absorbs. Nobody likes that greasy, sticky feeling after applying lotion, and Eucerin avoids that entirely. It sinks into my skin with ease, leaving it feeling soft and supple, without any residue.Additionally, the fact that this lotion is scent-free is a huge bonus. I don't have to worry about conflicting fragrances with other products or an overpowering scent lingering on my skin. It's a simple and effective moisturizing solution without any unnecessary frills.",

                "reviewText": "I have very dry skin on my arms and legs, and I\u2019m also battling some crepey skin on my upper arms. This was recommended on YouTube as an affordable alternative to pricier lotions made for crepey skin. I\u2019ve been using it for a few months now and I think my crepey skin is improving! My legs look better too- still a bit dry but I think the skin tone is better- less blotchy. I also use it on my neck and d\u00e9colletage as an affordable alternative to very expensive neck and chest creams. Only odd thing- it absorbs nicely on my arms and legs but hours later my neck will still feel a bit greasy. But it\u2019s not irritating my skin! And that\u2019s huge for me as I have sensitive skin and prone to the occasional breakout. But do NOT use on face or neck if you plan to put makeup over it. It does not take makeup well at all!",
