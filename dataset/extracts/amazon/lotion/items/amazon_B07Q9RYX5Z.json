        "description": "Long lists of ingredients can be daunting to read, making it difficult to decide which skincare products are right for you. Cocoa Butter, Shea Butter, and Coconut Oil are some of the natural ingredients for skin you may see in products, but how do you know which natural skincare ingredients are best for you? When it comes to Shea Butter, it's known as one of the best natural skincare ingredients. Due to vitamins and fatty acids, it delivers nourishing properties with rich moisturization lasting up to 48 hours. It's known for being gentle and ideal for sensitive skin. Regularly using products like Palmer's Raw Shea Body Lotion can improve the way your skin looks and feels. Sustainably sourced in Africa, this form of shea butter for skin combines the healing, hydrating power of shea with skin-loving ingredients like oatmeal, grapeseed oil, and Vitamin E to create a powerhouse lotion that nourishes dry skin, leaving it soft and glowing every day. Since shea butter for skin is natural, it's good for people with sensitive skin to use, as it's non-irritating. Its soothing, emollient formula works wonders for dry skin and locks in moisture, keeping your skin soft and smooth for longer.",
