After trying so many moisturizers where some may leave me a bit too \u201cgreasy\u201d with too much of a dewey look, and some being a little too light that feels like I need to keep reapplying, this is so nice!It is the perfect consistency for me. It feels like butter the way it spreads and settles in. Such a rich, moisturizing texture without the greasy look. Bonus points from me and why I will continue to purchase this product, is how easily available it is, the incredible prices, and most important for me is the different sizes it comes in\u2014traveling on-board? NP the 2.5 oz bottles come in handy. Need a big size for home? NP. My new fav moisturizer.",

It is preferred over ANY other brand I have tried over the years. A must have. It is also great for itchy skin because of the oatmeal in the ingredients. Helps in the winter months for that reason. There is no scent so it won't clash with your perfume. I highly recommend to everyone!",

For guys it's actually really difficult to find a good product that really hydrates and yet doesn't smell like women perfume.This is fantastic for guys that work with their hands all day and keep having dry broken paperdry hands afterward. Just keep this handy (pun intended) and it will keep your hands feeling like normal again and not cracking in bloody lines. I also use it on my face at night before bed to keep myself look younger and fight off acne or bleemishes.I know it's not something a lot of men are used to do (to moisturize), but trust me guy, this is not rocket science and it will help keep your skin from hurting. You can apply it to the rest of your body too if you want your skin to be more elastic after a workout at the gym.",
