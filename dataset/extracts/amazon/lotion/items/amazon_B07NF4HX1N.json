I used to use Vaseline cocoa butter lotion and loved it, however this lotion is wonderful. It\u2019s a smaller bottle than the Vaseline bottle but I use less of this lotion for my whole body (only about 5-6 pumps versus ~10+). This lotion is thick and initially leaves a bit of a white cast when you spread it evenly, however within the next 2 minutes it absorbs fully. My skin feels super soft and very moisturized with just one application until my next shower. The scent is also nice and not overwhelming like the greasy Bath and Body Works lotions I also used to use.Highly recommend for anyone wanting make a non-toxic swap.",

I like that it's EWG certified for gentle ingredients. The scent is very mild- it smells nice but isn't overpowering. It moisturizes nicely and isn't greasy. Will purchase again!",

It absorbs super fast and spreads so well, leaving my skin smooth and softer than it\u2019s ever been! It also seems to last throughout the day even in the dry winter climate here in Canada. Some products make my sensitive skin react, but so far every Attitude product I\u2019ve tried hasn\u2019t irritated my skin at all. I\u2019m switching to Attitude products for everything because they are superior to any other brands and I love that they are clean products and are made in Canada!",
