                "reviewText": "My skin was parched and dry in Vegas. Here, I doesn\u2019t matter if its summer or winter, the water is sucked out of you in the desert climate. So the moment this got delivered, I didn\u2019t wait for a shower, I ripped into the box and slathered it on my hands and smelled it. Kind of a medicinal odor. I didn\u2019t care. I worked it into my forearms and watched as the white scaly skin turned back into its natural color. I hadn\u2019t put my makeup on and my face hurt, so I put a generous amount all over my face, including my eyelids. It felt so good I spread the excess down onto my neck. I almost heard my skin go \u201caaaahhhhh\u2026\u201d There was absolutely no burning around my eyes which surprised me, as some of my very expensive facial creams warn against getting close to the eyes, and if you\u2019ve ever experienced stinging, crying eyes, you know why. But with this simple drugstore St. Ives lotion, all I felt was good.I got curious so I started reading the bottle. Aptly named Nourish and Soothe, it said it was made of 100% natural ingredients. Nice. I turned to the back label and it confirmed my experience. Soothing hydration, non-greasy\u2026says it intensely hydrates. The only thing that didn\u2019t jive was the warning in caps; avoid contact with eyes. But I wasn\u2019t worried. Mine were still saying thank you.The ingredient list doesn\u2019t seem 100% natural, but if your skin is hurting from dryness, just don\u2019t read it. If you don\u2019t like the smell, be patient. It fades. From my perspective, 21 ounces of relief for under $10 that is gentle enough for my eyes but strong enough to turn tough skin on my feet soft is pretty incredible. Take a shot and buy it. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for my scalp. Yep, that's weird, but I was sick and tired of my scalp being dry and flaking and I was ready to try anything. I put the lotion in one of those narrow tip bottles that they use for hair coloring and I applied the lotion where my head was itchy. I had been using scalp oils and none of them really moisturized, but this gave me relief from the itching and I don't have flakes anymore! I do need to mention that I confirmed that I didn't have any other scalp issues/infections going on, it was just a dry scalp.I worked in a med spa and had access to all sorts of expensive, fancy-pants products but I really trust the St. Ives products. So when I needed something for my scalp, I immediately went to them. This \"flavor\" has a little bit of a neutral scent, and it absorbs completely and doesn't leave a residue. And the small amount that gets on my hair makes my hair soft...even though that is not the intent.",

                "reviewText": "I am a frequent user of vegan and organic products due in large part to the fact that there is no active government body which regulates chemicals used in food or cosmetics. While this product is not vegan or organic by any means, it is a great, inexpensive substitute to use in between purchases.It works wonders on dry skin and even eczema. I applied some to mine and my husband's cracked hands and knuckles, weathered from working long hours in the wintery cold. Doing this just a few times in one day significantly improved our discomfort and left our hands feeling soft and smooth. It does feel a bit greasy after application (any lotion that claims it feels otherwise is simply not telling the truth), but by blotting a few times with a towel just enough to not slip off of slick surfaces or leave a lotion-y residue (i.e. touch phones) that quickly resolved the issue. I also rubbed some of the lotion into his sore spots where his eczema flares up. While it did not heal him completely, it did help to reduce his desire to itch.I truly love the scent of this lotion. It is sweet (but not overpoweringly so) and calming. I'm a big believer in aromatherapy and the power that certain scents have to relax the nerves. I often purchase items with lavender in them for this very reason. However, this scent had a surprising effect on me (and my husband!). We couldn't stop sniffing our hands after applying it to our cracked knuckles, and each time we did so, smiles spread across our faces. It's not quite \"fresh baked cookies at grandma's house.\" More of a \"coming home after a long day of work and drinking some good tea\" type feeling. It really puts you in a good mood, and I imagine it would give you an extra \"clean\" feeling when applying fresh out of the shower.My only concern with this product lies in one of its ingredients. There are a handful of ingredients in this product of which to be wary, but none that are cause for too much concern. These are mostly potential irritants to those who have particularly sensitive skin. Although, I have VERY sensitive skin and I had no adverse reactions to this product. However, there is one ingredient listed called cyclopentasiloxane that does worry me a bit. While it is ranked as one of the lower toxins on ewg.org, it is still linked to cancerous tumor formation in animal studies when given at moderate doses according to the Dow Corning Corporation. This certainly isn't a product I would use every single day of my life only because of the amount of ingredients I can't pronounce let alone identify without a reference, but in small doses I don't think it would be particularly harmful. This is just my personal preference.Overall, I really like this product. It works well, smells great, and gives me very little concerns in terms of chemical content. I would definitely recommend this to a friend or family member, especially one who is experiencing extreme dryness with their skin!",
