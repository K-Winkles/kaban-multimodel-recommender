That's why Cur\u00e9l Skincare is on a mission to end dry skin, for good. This mission is what compelled Cur\u00e9l scientists to gain unparalleled knowledge of what happens in the skin when it becomes dry. They found that ceramides, the moisture-retaining molecules within the skin, are vital to healthy skin. When ceramides are lost, skin becomes dry and damaged. This is what drove us to develop our Advanced Ceramide Complex and include it in all Cur\u00e9l moisturizers. Our moisturizers work at the source of dryness, helping replenish skin's ceramide levels, for restored and hydrated skin. We can't wait to see what incredible things can be accomplished with dry skin worries behind you! Cur\u00e9l, the end of dry skin, the beginning of so much more.",
