Inis is the Irish word for 'island' and the fragrance was inspired by the beauty and energy of the wild Atlantic coast of Ireland. Signature Scent of Fragrances of Ireland We are a family owned boutique perfumery and Inis is our signature collection.. Independent and passionate, we operate from a converted farmhouse in County Wicklow. For over 30 years we have been creating perfumes and personal care inspired by the beauty and nature of Ireland. Sea the Difference All of our body care products feature skin-restoring seaweed extracts that help hydrate and rejuvenate the skin. The cold, pristine waters of the Atlantic ocean are the source of the nutrient-rich seaweed found in our products, along with other nourishing ingredients like shea butter, argan oil, aloe vera and vitamin E. Our Commitment to Dolphins and Whales The ocean is a place of wonder and magic, its energy is the inspiration for Inis the Energy of the Sea. For over 18 years it has been our honour to be the core funder of the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group - dedicated to the protection, conservation and better understanding of whales and dolphins in Irish waters and around the world.",
