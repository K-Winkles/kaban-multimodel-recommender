It also smells like chocolate. The downside is that you have to cut every bottle because a an entire 1/4 of the product will get stuck in the bottle and that is a lot of product.

                "reviewText": "So I've seen this product in the store and what not but I've never tried it. I've lost A LOT of weight and am concerned about the loose skin. My Boyfriend suggested this so I looked at the reviews and saw one lady comment about using this along with derma rolling. So I bought it. It just arrived a few days ago and have used it a few times since then. First impressions: When I saw it come out of the pump it reminded me of a silicone cream, but it goes on MUCH better and smoother than the silicone cream and does not leave the greasy residue. This stuff soaks right in, I almost feel like I need to use a little more during application. My skin feels like silk, doesn't have a residue or weird feel to it. This lotion lasts for a long time too, unlike other lotions where you have to keep re applying it. The scent...for some reason I thought it would smell like sun tan lotion, ya know, beachy... But...it has a slight smell of chocolate...hence the COCOA BUTTER...lol. But it does smell pretty good! My boyfriend doesn't find it overwhelming which is a plus. I will definitely be purchasing this again when this bottle is gone.",
