This set of 6 has been really helpful to have; I purchased at the start of the winter and placed a bottle in each room of the house so we don't have to search around for it. In a family with dry skin/ eczema, this has been gentle enough for all of us. I even use this on my young toddler and her skin has responded very well to it. I see no difference between this and when I used eczema baby cream on her, in fact, she has fewer breakouts.",
