It lasts a long time. I do like it in my toddlers skin because it\u2019s sort of watered down and not too thick like some of the usual baby lotions. However, on me and my husbands skin it was like water. We were ashy about an hour later. I\u2019d say this is soothing and great for going to sleep after a night bath or shower but don\u2019t expect to go out on a day trip or too the beach with this on, if your brown skin like us, your legs will be white within an hour.",
