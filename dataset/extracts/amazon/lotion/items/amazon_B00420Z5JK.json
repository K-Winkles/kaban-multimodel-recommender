A kiss in the dark can be sensual or scary. Judas betrayed the Son of Man with a kiss. I don't know if I would classify the smell though, to be about betrayal, more like seduction, but subtly so. Definitely not fitting for a lady, like Christian Dior Dolce La Vita. Nah, this is definitely woman quality stuff. ;) A woman, not necessarily a promiscuis one, just a woman who is not afraid to let her hair down once in a while. Where her husband does not mind her being \"showy\", if she is indeed married. A lady is a woman who is most diligently kept, reserved, funny, excitingly witty and extraordinarily accustomed to the ways of properness. Women can pull of being a lady just as well, it is our nature, but not with this fragrance. LOL. I am indeed being silly. I do like this fragrance, it's fun and unique.",
