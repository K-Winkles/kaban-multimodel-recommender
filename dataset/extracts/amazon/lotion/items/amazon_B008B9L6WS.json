                "reviewText": "The Gold Bond Healing Hydrating Lotion, specifically the 14 oz. variant, is truly a phenomenal product in terms of effectiveness and overall quality. From its impressive hydrating properties to the addition of soothing aloe, this lotion addresses multiple skin care needs in one package.One of the best things about this product is its ability to provide sustained 24-hour hydration. In a world of skincare products that make grandiose claims, Gold Bond delivers on this promise. One application a day keeps my skin feeling supple and soft all day long. The immediate hydration effect is visible from the get-go, and my skin texture has noticeably improved since I started using this lotion.The aloe inclusion deserves a special mention. It provides a soothing effect that\u2019s like a salve to my sensitive skin. Its healing benefits are evident on those troublesome dry patches that seem to resist other products. I\u2019ve seen marked improvement since using this lotion, which is a testament to its healing power.Now, while I can\u2019t help but sing praises, there is a slight caveat. The fragrance, while pleasant and mild, may not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea. It doesn\u2019t bother me, but it is noticeable enough that if you\u2019re not a fan of scented lotions, you might have to weigh that aspect against the undeniable benefits of this product.Even though the lotion is packed with hydrating properties, it doesn\u2019t leave an oily or greasy feeling on the skin. It absorbs fairly quickly, which is always a good thing, especially for people who don\u2019t have much time to spare in their skincare routine.The packaging is solid, and I particularly appreciate the pump, which dispenses the lotion easily. The 14 oz. size is pretty generous, ensuring that you get a decent run out of a single purchase. It might seem a bit pricey, but considering the benefits and the long-lasting nature of the product, it\u2019s a worthy investment.All in all, the Gold Bond Healing Hydrating Lotion with Aloe is a superb product. While the fragrance might not appeal to everyone, the undeniable hydrating and healing benefits it offers make it a five-star contender in my book. It\u2019s become a mainstay in my daily skincare routine, and I believe anyone who values quality skincare would appreciate it.Thank you for taking the time to read my review. I hope it helps you in making an informed choice. Wishing you the best of luck in your skincare journey, and may you find your ideal product. Happy moisturizing!",

                "reviewText": "Gold Bond Healing Hydration Lotion absolutely works, and works quickly. I first used it on my feet, that had been very cracked, rough and dry. After 24 hours, I noticed such a significant improvement, no more dry and rough feet, that I now use it on my feet and lower legs below the knee, and on my hands and arms up to my elbow. And if I plan to go outside in the cold weather, put it on my face. Makes your skin look and feel wonderful.",

The consistency is thick but it isn't difficult to work into the skin and it doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy or gross.it's very moisturizing and my skin feels very soft after using this. I like to use it all over my body and it keeps me feeling moisturized and smooth ! The best thing is that the bottle is HUGE",

Definitely not diluted down like so many of these products on the market. Our old favorite brand that we used to use feels like water compared to this. The only problem is that since it is so thick, a lot of product gets stuck at the bottom of the container when it\u2019s getting low and will not pump out. We cut it open and scoop it out.",
