Our formula is made out of 100% cold-pressed oils with no water, which means it is 100% preservative-free. Why should I prefer a moisturizer with no preservatives? Preservatives eradicate bacteria that might cause contamination. It will not distinguish between harmful organisms, and beneficial skin bacteria. Your skin is your biggest organ, and using moisturizers clean of preservatives will benefit your skin. Why do water-based formulas use preservatives? Many moisturizers will have water as the first ingredient, which means they are 85%-95% water. Water is easily contaminated and cannot sustain extended shelf life without preservatives. How does your formula maintain shelf life with no preservatives? Our formula is made of 100% cold-pressed oils. Bacteria will not grow in oil, which is contamination-resistant by nature. In addition, we use a state-of-the-art airless bottle, which prevents the formula from exposure to air. Why should I choose Ancient Greek Remedy Butter Cream? We make small batches with care and love using the highest quality organic cold-pressed oils. The formula is suitable for all skin types and is 100% free from water, preservatives, parabens, gluten, fillers, artificial scents, and chemicals.",

Personally, I love the scent it is a very natural lavender with rosemary notes. The scent lightly lingers for a brief time.",

                "reviewText": "I find this to be all excellent multi-purpose, unisex moisturizer. This makes it great for people who are trying to cut down on the number of products they use, especially for travel. It's in an airtight dispenser that will easily pump out every drop to the bottom. To me the scent is suitable for any gender. I don't find it flowery feminine or too masculine. Also, a little goes quite a long way, so it will last.Face: My face tends to be on the oilier side, so personally I wouldn't use this daytime under makeup. I find it to be great at nighttime though. A very small amount is all you need. I had no trouble with it clogging pores or making my face feel like a grease pit.Hands & body: Great body moisturizer after shower, just a small amount is needed. It soaks in within a few minutes, doesn't make my clothes greasy. Excellent moisturizer for hands and cuticles overnight. In the daytime you might want to wipe your palms off a bit with a tissue.Hair: I have shoulder length hair, semi-course and very thick with a strong natural wave. This worked great for me three ways. 1. Overnight or before-shower treatment on dry ends, 2. Through damp hair before drying (very small amount, maybe the size of three straight-pin heads), 3. Lightly after drying to smooth flyaways or frizzies.This has high-quality natural ingredients that are great for the hair and skin. Being a multi-use unisex product with convenient packaging makes it ideal for travel or space-saving at home. Thumbs up, I would definitely buy this again!",

                "reviewText": "I REALLY wanted to give this a 5 star review... but its unfortunately not that. My initial thoughts on the scent were a natural lavender with notes of an earthy environment that instantly transported me to Greece and made me feel really calm and peaceful. The scent may initially come off as rather masculine but I'd say its balanced out by the lavender making it perfect for any and every one. About an hour later, the scent shifted to having no undernotes of earth and instead having a sweeter lavender smell making it smell almost like Grapefruit. The cream felt good at first.. but eventually felt hot as it felt as though my pores and skin were clogged by it making me itchy and look red which was especially on my face. On top of that, I've never had this happen to me but the cream made my light yet warm skin turn a shade darker which instantly washed off as I took a bath making it go back to its natural color. While taking a bath, there was weird dirt water coming off me which I've never seen before but I wouldn't be surprised if it was the cream. The cream didn't feel like other creams/lotions that I've used where its absorbed by the skin.. it felt as though it was just on it while moisturizing. It worked a lot better on my hair but I've since been hesitant to put it back on as I don't want whatever that weird dirt was to just be sitting on my hair. I think it may work better on others but for my sensitive skin and hair.. I really don't think it helps.Edit: I forgot to mention that this came inside a box with a scratch off card with a discount for future purchases. I got 30% off but I'm sure there's higher and lower ones. I thought that was really nice of them to include. I requested a refund and promptly received it as well as an unscented bottle for free which I thought was really nice of the company.Edit 2: I've recently tried using this about an hour or so before a shower as a leave in and highly recommend it be used as such. It still wasnt perfect but it personally worked much better for me like that.",
