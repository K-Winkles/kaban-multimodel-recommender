A very environmental product. I have used this product for a few years now and have ordered through Amazon in the past year or so. And while in the past it was a hit or miss whether it leaked or not this recent delivery has an upgraded packaging that is just perfect. It was delivered in a box that was appropriate for its size and had plastic securing it in the box so it could not move and thus prevented any possible leak. So excellent upgrade and I'm very grateful to be able to order it especially since I live in a rural area. I have been without this product for about two months I think and have missed it enormously !",

                "reviewText": "I JUST now got it so i've not tried it yet, but wanted to let the manufacturer know they need to put a semi-hard plastic ring around the top of the bottle so this won't happen to someone else.I\"m sure the lotion is good and i will update on that later, but for now i'm NOT happy that the bottle top came loose and now the inside of the \"protective\" (ha!) bag has a ton of the lotion in it. PLEASE add a secure plastic ring around the lids of this product in the future!I only gave it three stars for now because of the lid.**UPDATE**Apparently there WAS a plastic ring on the pump part, but it was definitely not secure. I don't know if these bottles go through something akin to a milkshake mixer en route to their destination, but the \"secure\" (HA!) plastic ring around the lid was almost all the way off.THE MANUFACTURERS NEED TO START PUTTING THE PUMP PART OF THE TOP ASIDE THE BOTTLE, WITH A SCREW ON LID. That way, when the lotion arrives at its destination, the buyer can switch the screw-off lid to the pump lid. I mean, SERIOUSLY, how hard would that be???Ok, now that i've vented, i CAN honestly say that the lotion itself is excellent.It's not greasy, absorbs into the skin very nicely and leaves skin buttery soft. Also has a really nice, light scent, not heavy or overpowering. Added a star for that reason.",

                "reviewText": "Very appreciative of this product! It\u2019s the only lotion I\u2019ve used, ever since they\u2019ve made it, for many, many years. Love that it has no scent - this benefit is huge. No worries about respiratory reactions, watery eyes, headaches\u2026that I get from so many other products that are toxically scented.Another thing I really like: it doesn\u2019t leave a greasy film on my skin. It seems to absorb well. Most important, in the winter especially, it prevents annoying and painful hangnails. I keep an extra bottle in the kitchen and use it on my hands after they\u2019ve had to get wet. The bottle in the bathroom gets used after every shower. Especially nice after a leg shave.Here\u2019s a tip: Use a knife to (carefully) cut off the bottom part of the bottle, once the lotion supply gets low enough to where the pump can\u2019t reach - just keep it covered with plastic wrap and an elastic band, and then that remaining lotion at the bottom of the bottle can last another 2-3 weeks. I also fill tiny bottles with it to keep in my purse, and also bring it on every trip, as a remedy for overly-drying restroom soap. Keeps my skin in tip top shape. Highly recommended!",
