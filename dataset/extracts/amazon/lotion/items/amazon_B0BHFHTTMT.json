It has a really pleasant, light scent and within a minute, it's soaked in and my skin feels soft and stays that way for several hours.I have noticed a cumulative effect, so if I use it several days in row, my skin feels softer for longer in between uses. Still trying to get into the habit of isn't it every day after my shower.4 stars because it can be a bit pricey compared to other options if it's not bought when it's on sale.",

My skin not only looks more youthful, but it also has a radiant glow now. I am absolutely in love with this lotion. Here's my routine: I first apply Snail Mucin, and after waiting for about 20 minutes, I follow up with this lotion. It does wonders in moisturizing my skin and significantly reducing the appearance of those pesky dark spots. As an African American woman, my skin had started to look dull before, but not anymore. I'm definitely sticking with this lotion and will continue to use it every single day.",
