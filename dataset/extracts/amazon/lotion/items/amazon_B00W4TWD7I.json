                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Helped get my post-pregnancy stomach back in shape: A complete review",
                "reviewText": "I just had my first baby at age 35 and one thing I wasn\u2019t expecting was how loose my skin would be after giving birth. This lotion has helped tremendously with firming up lose skin on my stomach and making it look so much healthier. I am currently 8 weeks postpartum and have been using this lotion for the past 6 weeks and see a big improvement in the looseness and crepe-iness of my stomach.I had a healthy pregnancy, gaining a healthy amount of weight for my growing little one. But you forget that for all those 9 months your skin gets stretched to full capacity. I had a c section and if 9 months of stretch wasn\u2019t bad enough, having your skin opened and retracted even more by forceps is even worse. After my c section I was horrified by the appearance my stomach, it was lumpy, loose, uneven and crepey. I vowed to find a way to get my skin and body back. After hours of researching expensive creams I found that this Jergens Firming Lotion had all the ingredients geared toward improving loose skin and at a mere $5 it was totally worth it.Our skin is made of up collagen and elastin which are what allows it to stretch and move. It also is what gives skin a youthful tight appearance. As we age collagen production in the body slows down and that is what contributes to our skin aging (.ie. wrinkling, looseness, sagging) This lotion contains both collagen and elastin which really help to \u201cplump\u201d up dry, loose skin. I saw a noticeable difference immediately. The lotion goes on smooth, rubs in entirely and is not heavy at all. After putting it on, my skin still feels clean, and not greasy at all. A lot of heavily moisturizing creams leave you feeling sticky or greasy but not this one, my skin just looks and feels hydrated without any residue. The pump makes it easy and convenient to put it on right after the shower. Lastly, the scent. I\u2019m not sure what some other reviewers were complaining about but the Firming lotion is very lightly scented with just a fresh clean sort of smell. It\u2019s not perfumey or floral smelling. I have a very strong sense of smell and this lotion doesn\u2019t bother me. It goes on smelling clean and then I don\u2019t smell a thing after it\u2019s on.Now full disclosure... no cream is magic and cannot change the amount of loose skin someone has or magically shrink a belly back days after giving birth. But this lotion has really helped improve the look of my skin, the softness and also the health of my very damaged skin. In only 8 weeks my skin is back to looking like it used to prior to pregnancy. It also has improved the look of cellulite on my thighs which I\u2019ve had since puberty. I cannot recommend this lotion enough to new Mommas out there or anyone looking to firm up loose, aging skin or improve cellulite. Im hooked on this Jergens Skin Firming body lotion. Hope this review helps anyone else in the same boat!",
