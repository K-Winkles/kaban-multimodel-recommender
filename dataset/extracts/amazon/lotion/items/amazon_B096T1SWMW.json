I ended up also purchasing the body spray to match because I like the smell so much. The lotion makes your skin feel so incredibly smooth - better than any lotion I've used before. It's a little pricey for the amount you get, but I think the price is fair given the amazing quality of the lotion. I plan to purchase more lotions by this brand in the future.",

                "reviewText": "BUT\u2026. A LITTLE PRICEY!Definitely a little pricy for the quantity so I\u2019m only going to buy this on sale from now on.HELPED WITH MY RAZOR BURN!This lotion did NOT cure any discoloration on my legs, stretch marks, or body acne. There\u2019s nothing incredible about the properties of this lotion. BUT! It definitely helped with razor bumps after shaving, some mild discoloration on my legs, and smoothing out skin texture on my butt and arms.I really only use this lotion for the amazing sent and for after I shave.I use other dermatologist approved body lotions like Cerave if I am wanting to address my skin concerns.AMAZING SENT!!At first I was hesitant about a lotion with such a strong smell\u2026 (I typically don\u2019t go for perfume lotions) BUT the sent was so refreshing and sweet! Not overwhelming at all. After applying the lotion and letting it sink in the smell also dissipates more.VERY MOISTURIZING!!I have combination skin type and really sensitive skin, so certain products and lotions can make me either dry out more, breakout, or get really oily. This lotion was instantly moisturizing and set into my skin really well. My boyfriend definitely complimented how insanely smooth and soft my legs were after applying the lotion too!!ONLY 8.1 oz OF PRODUCT??The average lotion bottle has closer to 13oz of product in it. I was surprised that the largest tub they sold was less than 10oz and for almost $50!! However, although it\u2019s not a huge tub, thankfully a little does go a long way! I only really needed a few quarters sizes on my fingers to cover my arms and legs.",
