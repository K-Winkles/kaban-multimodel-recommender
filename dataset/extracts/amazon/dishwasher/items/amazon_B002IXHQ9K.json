There may be times when it\u2019s necessary to use a little more or less, depending on your dish load and water hardness. For something even simpler, try Cascade ActionPacs. Each pac provides the perfect dose of clean, so you know exactly how much to use, every time.How do ActionPacs work?Cascade, Cascade Complete, and Cascade Platinum ActionPacs make dishwashing even simpler by taking out the guesswork. They\u2019re easy to use because they require no measuring, unwrapping, crumbling, or cleanup. ActionPacs contain a higher concentration of detergents than powders and gels, plus built-in rinse and shine ingredients. To use, simply pop an ActionPac into your dishwasher\u2019s detergent cup, close the cup lid, and let your dishwasher run.My dishwasher manual says to fill both cups with detergent. Do I need to use two ActionPacs?Nope. You only need one ActionPac because the formula is concentrated. They\u2019re designed to give you a convenient, simple way to dose detergent with no premeasuring.Do I need to pre-rinse my dishes?Actually, with Cascade Complete powder, gel, and ActionPacs, and Cascade Platinum ActionPacs, you can skip the pre-scrub and load your dishes in right off the table. These formulas contain advanced cleaning and rinsing power, so pre-rinsing isn\u2019t necessary.What if I have hard water?Water hardness varies depending on where you live. The good news is all of our ActionPacs are formulated with water softeners to help fight hard water deposits on your dishes.How can I prevent filming on my glasses and dishware?Here are some simple steps you can take to help keep your glasses film-free:Fill both detergent cups for each load (if you\u2019re using Cascade ActionPacs, you only need to use one).Try using Cascade Rinse Aid, which protects surfaces and boosts drying to prevent spots and streaks.Dishwasher water temperature should be at least 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Try running hot water at the kitchen sink before starting the load to help reach this temperature.To help prevent low water pressure, make sure that no other water is being used in the house (showers, grass watering, washing machine, etc.).Be sure the dishwasher is loaded so that no items block the sprayer arms and prevent adequate water from reaching all the dishes.Once a month, use Cascade Dishwasher Cleaner to help remove limescale, grease, and odor buildup that can contribute to spotting and filming.Product Comparison Cascade Platinum Cascade Complete Cascade Our ultimate clean for dishes, and even helps keep dishwasher sparkling.

I started off using other pod brands, and they didn\u2019t get things clean. Then I found Cascade Platinum pods, and they worked super well, but the strong scent of them gave me headaches. I didn\u2019t think that this type of Cascade pod would work as well as the Platinum, but for me, it really does. The only difference I can tell in my dishes is that they don\u2019t smell strongly of chemicals like they did with the Platinum version, the stuff is just clean! Love these and this bull option.",

I think Cascade pods work better then Total, but that could be user preference. I do think they work better with JetDry, so I always use both. I almost never run my dishwasher on heavy, always on normal, and almost never have any food debris left on dishes.If I've left heavy grease or cookware without pre-rinse, heavy cycle seems to always remove everything.

                "reviewText": "Cascade is the best dishwasher detergent hands down! This tub of 105 packs of the OG Cascade is $20 bucks. The fancy tub of the platinum super soaker stuff gives you 62 packs for $20. I have very hard water so i use 2 packs when I have a really big or really dirty load. Maybe 4 out of 10 loads...I think I'm the winner in this game! The pretty colors and extra sections on top of the fancy expensive versions are just not worth it. I actually bought a big bottle of the original liquid Cascade (orange scent of course) and it did a wonderful job as well! Just use more detergent if you have hard water, use a rinse aid, Finish is the best in my opinion, and put it on turbo wash. Your dishwasher (and dishes) will thank you!",

                "reviewText": "These pacs are easy and awesome! I used to buy the cascade gel, but was noticing a white powder residue on some of the dishes. I bought jet dry thinking that may have been the issue, but it wasn't the residue was still there. I ordered these to try something different and they rock! It's an all in one!Pros: super easy, no mess, clean greatCons: if you do not be sure to dry out the area where your pac is placed, it may not release the pac properly. The water makes the outer coating stick to the dishwasher canister. If I know water got in that area, I will take a paper towel and dry it out with hopes it will release completely for a proper clean with all the powder (not 3/4 of it from being stuck)Love these pacs! will not be going back to powder/gel! Highly recommend!",
