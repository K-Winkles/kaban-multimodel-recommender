The trick is finding the \"sweet spot\" in your dishwasher, for your particular stemware. Try different spots along the edge of the top and bottom rack (the top rack is adjustable in many dishwashers if you're glasses are too tall). Pro tip 2: Check to make sure your wine glasses are dishwasher safe (don't worry, most are). Pro tip 3: Before you run your first cycle with Wine Wash, close the dishwasher door and re-open to ensure that a protrusion in the door or side wall is not pushing the clip off of the rack. If everything looks good, wash away! Pro tip 4: Once you've identified that sweet spot, for convenience, you can leave Wine Wash attachments clipped in between cycles.",

Though my stemware was dishwasher safe, I was afraid it would tip over and break in the dishwasher. And a really nice glass of wine just tastes better in a glass with a stem (sorry stemless), so I took matters into my own hands. Countless designs, prototypes and bottles of wine later, Wine Wash was born. A simple gadget that lets you safely wash your wine glasses in the dishwasher. My hope is that it makes your life a little easier - less time hand washing, more time for the important stuff. In addition to our flagship Wine Wash, I\u2019ve created some really fun cleaning accessories and gifts for the tidy wine lover. Let\u2019s make choring less boring!

                "reviewText": "I recently bought wine glasses on Amazon. I first made very careful measurements of my dishwasher to make sure that they would fit on the top rack. Once I received the wine glasses I found that because of their shape they could only stand stable on the top rack in a way that caused the wine glass base to rub against the dishwasher wall, which caused the glasses to lean sideways when pulling out or pushing in the rack. I ordered the Wine Wash glass holders to hopefully solve this problem. They worked very well. They were easy to attach to both the wine glasses and the dishwasher rack. The wine glasses stayed secure through the wash and were easy to remove from the Wine Wash holders when I removed them from the dishwasher. Overall I would say they are a very good product and I\u2019m glad that I bought them but their cost seems a bit high.",

                "reviewText": "I recently had to replace a dishwasher that had a built-in wine glass rack extension. As the removeable rack didn't work in the new machine I purchased these holders. They are adequate and serve the purpose sufficiently. Easy to install and position, they can be moved around in the machine to accommodation grid configuration. Once attached to the wine glass stem, there is enough tilt to drain water from the inverted foot of the glass. Four stars as durability is yet uncertain. Also, the idea of supporting a small independent business is appealing! Recommended.",

Only work for about 50% of the kinds of wine glasses that I have. First of all if the glass is a very large diameter, it will not work because the clip is too short. On some glasses, the bowl of the glass extends too far down the stem so that the stem is lower than the 4 1/2 inch height of the side of the rack that it would need to attach to. Ok if you're lucky enough to have glasses that fit.",
