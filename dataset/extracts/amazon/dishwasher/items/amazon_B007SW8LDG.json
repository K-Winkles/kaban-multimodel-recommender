It gets the dishes clean, mind you, I'm saying clean, not spot-free. Spot-free refers to a dishwasher's job to properly first rinse the dishes off, then evaporate the water to dry them (if you use that setting on your dishwasher). So it's not the detergent's job. It's the dishwasher's job. This detergent smells nice too. I like it way better than the lemon.",
