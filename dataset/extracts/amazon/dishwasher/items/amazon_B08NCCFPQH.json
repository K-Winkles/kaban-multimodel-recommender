                "reviewText": "I have a very old dishwasher and was ready to trash it because my dishes just were not getting clean anymore. I was constantly having to rewash many items. Also, since being diagnosed with Lyme, and having many co-diseases from that, I\u2019ve been doing my best to rid our home of toxic products. I\u2019ve tried Melaluca brands, Seventh Generation, Bronners, and other brands\u2026 and just wasn\u2019t finding anything that I was satisfied with. Then one day I bought the Dropp fabric softener tabs and was floored at how great they were! So I checked out their other products, and decided to give the dishwasher tabs a try. Am I glad I made that decision!! I didn\u2019t realize how yucky my dishes felt coming out of the dishwasher\u2026 until I removed them after using these tabs for the first time. Wow, wow, wow! These are small tabs\u2026 but they pack a mighty punch! My glasses actually FELT clean, and I saw very minimal spotting (as I said, my dishwasher is old\u2014like 18 years old! It was leaving a LOT of spotting, even with using the rinse aid. Mind you, we have hard water also.) I cannot wait to get a new dishwasher and see the REAL power of these tabs in a machine that\u2019s actually working the way it should. The scent is mild, not overpowering at all (plus, I\u2019m not concerned about a scent when it comes to my dishes!). Packaging around the tabs dissolves easily, and the box it comes in is compact and compostable/recyclable. I don\u2019t think anyone could go wrong purchasing these dishwasher tabs\u2026 they are really good.",

Also, I've noticed a lot of film on my dishes, you can feel it. I don't like that or the idea of eating it. Lastly, trying to reduce microplastics.Anyway, I'm certainly no tree hugger. I am responsible but not militant. Everything else aside, these are fantastic. I've yet to have anything not come out spotless since switching. Also, absolutley no film or residue. I also don't use a dry aid.Yes, they cost about double, but at least they do what they say and they are healthier.",

                "reviewText": "I was in the process of transitioning all of my dishwashing/laundry products to vegan and cruelty fee options, and I will say I was very nervous as sometimes the efficacy of these products aren't that great. I did a TON of research and read so many reviews, but decided to try Dropps. These are a HUGE win. I got the unscented kind as in the past with using cascade pods, I could taste a chemically residue on my silverware. Not with these. They work so well; my dishes are spotless. I do use a vegan and cruelty free rinse aid from a different brand (ECOS) as I have hard water where I live, but I feel like I could skip the rinse aid and still have spotless dishes with these dish pods. I will never go back!!!! Give them a try! The only thing I would have liked is if the brand was Leaping Bunny certified. My 5 star rating would jump up to 10 stars.",

                "reviewText": "Dropps Dishwasher Detergent is a convenient and eco-friendly option for achieving spotless and sparkling dishes. As someone who values both effective cleaning and sustainability, I was eager to put this product to the test. After using Dropps for several weeks, I can confidently say that it delivers on its promises, with a few minor considerations.One of the standout features of Dropps Dishwasher Detergent is its commitment to the environment. The detergent pods are free from phosphates, chlorine, and other harsh chemicals commonly found in traditional dishwasher detergents. The product is cruelty-free, vegan, and comes in a minimalistic packaging that is recyclable and free from unnecessary plastic waste. This eco-conscious approach makes Dropps an appealing choice for those looking to reduce their environmental footprint.Using Dropps is incredibly convenient. The detergent comes in pre-measured pods, eliminating the need for messy pouring or measuring cups. Simply toss one pod into the dishwasher dispenser, and it dissolves quickly, releasing the cleaning power. The pods are compatible with all dishwasher models and work effectively in both hard and soft water.In terms of cleaning performance, Dropps does a commendable job. It effectively removes food residues, grease, and stains from dishes, leaving them clean and shiny. The detergent is particularly efficient at tackling dried-on food, which is a common challenge in dishwashing. It also helps to prevent spots and streaks on glassware, ensuring a spotless finish.Another notable advantage of Dropps is its mild and pleasant fragrance. Unlike some dishwasher detergents that leave behind a strong chemical odor, Dropps leaves dishes smelling fresh and clean. The fragrance is subtle and not overpowering, enhancing the overall dishwashing experience.One aspect to consider with Dropps is that the effectiveness of the detergent may vary depending on the hardness of your water and the specific dishwasher model. Some users with very hard water have reported that the cleaning results were not as satisfactory as with traditional detergents. However, for most individuals, Dropps provides excellent cleaning performance and is a reliable option for everyday dishwashing needs.Price-wise, Dropps Dishwasher Detergent falls within the range of premium dishwasher detergents. While it may be slightly more expensive than some conventional options, the eco-friendly and convenient aspects, coupled with the effective cleaning performance, make it a worthwhile investment.In conclusion, Dropps Dishwasher Detergent offers a convenient and eco-friendly solution for achieving clean and spotless dishes. Its commitment to sustainability, effective cleaning power, and pleasant fragrance make it a top choice for those seeking a greener dishwashing option. While effectiveness may vary depending on water hardness, for the majority of users, Dropps delivers reliable results. If you're looking for a convenient, eco-conscious, and efficient dishwasher detergent, Dropps is definitely worth considering.",
