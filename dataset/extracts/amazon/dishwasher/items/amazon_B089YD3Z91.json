The cleanliness of hand dishwashing is only 60% that of automatic dishwashing, as your hands and washing cloth are often dirty due to remaining makeup, dirt, grime, and more.

Fits my 10 1/2\" plates. I LOVE IT! I would recommend this in a heartbeat! Great for kitchens that can't spare the space for full sized built in dishwasher!",

                "reviewText": "I decided to purchase this machine when I finally got fed up with my dishes situation. I moved to an older 1 bedroom apartment with a small kitchen. The sink is not very deep, nor is it split. The faucet is short and I would always bump it with my hands when I was working. Basically, making doing dishes well by hand a huge hassle.I started looking into portable/ countertop dishwashers and this is the product I settled on. I like the clear glass front and the tank that allows you to fill it with a pitcher. However, what really sold me, was this was the perfect size for the small space of counter to the left of my skink.I am writing this review about 3 months into owning this product. So far- it is super great. I only use the normal wash, speed wash, and drying function of this machine. As a single person, this usually holds all my dishes. So 3 meals of dishes, plus cups and silverware. I only run it more than twice a day if I have people over. More space would have been nice, but then, I don\u2019t have room in my apartment for anything bigger than this. However, I would note this size would probably be too small for a couple if you eat 3 meals at home a day.I have had 0 issues with this product so far. It\u2019s easy to fill the tank with water, and it runs like a charm. It takes 69 mins wash on normal, and 29 mins on speed wash. I just tell it to wash just before I go to bed, and when I wake up my dishes are clean and dry.Some things to note- this machine does not have a detergent dispenser. There is a small indent in the door where you can put a washer pod. But other than that- it just starts washing right away. Meaning\u2026 there is no \u2018real\u2019 prewash cycle. This isn\u2019t a huge deal for me. My dishes are never gross because I do them every day. I also always rinse them right after I eat, so any food falls off. However, if you are a person like my old roommate\u2026 who keeps dishes in their room for a week and lets food get crusty and moldy on them, then- this dishwasher probably will not be powerful enough for you. I\u2019d recommend using pods with this machine just because they dissolve a little slower so you can get a bit of a mini- fake prewash however. I\u2019m using the cascade ones, and they work perfect.The fan also has a higher pitched sound than I thought. This bothered me at first, so I put a fan in my room to drown out the dishwasher fan. (Note my apartment is really small. In a bigger place you could probably not hear the fan.) But, now I am used to it and it does not bother me.But other than those few things, this machine is great. I am glad I gave it the counter space. It makes my life easier and my glasses and forks are finally crystal clear and sparkling. I would recommend this product greatly.",

                "reviewText": "I rarely write product reviews because I order too many things and don't have the time, but I feel like this product deserves all the love. I was skeptical of it when I ordered because not all reviews were favorable and it's expensive for your average person, but I'm glad I went with my gut. I've had it for about a month now and used it probably 30 times at this point. And I have yet to be disappointed. It's compact enough to sit on my counter without taking up too much space (although I may end up getting a rolling cart for it because it's still kind of big), is super easy to use, and has really helped me to not feel as anxious about dishes. I don't have a faucet that can hook up to this (I think that was intentional by the landlord since he pays for hot water) so the built in tank is ideal. It has multiple cycles, can fit a fair amount of dishes (I can usually run 4-5 plates, 3-4 glasses or mugs, a bowl or two, and plenty of silverware at once), gets everything clean without any issues, and even notifies me when water is needed in the tank or I've reached the capacity so I don't overfill it.The only things that I have an issue with are that the dishwasher pods don't fit in the spot they are supposed to, but it's not a big deal because you can just toss it in the bottom of the dishwasher and it'll do what you need it to do, and that my larger plates don't fit and need to be angled (with only a couple at a time). These are such minor issues, though, that I don't care.Great product overall and I've already been recommending it to several friends who also have landlords too cheap to provide a dishwasher. I'll update this review if anything changes.06/11/22 Update: Still working great and I've used it about 70 times since I got it. So happy I made the decision to buy this.09/06/23 Update: Still cranking out those clean dishes. I've used it well over 500 times since I got it and have had zero issues. It's well worth the money.",

                "reviewText": "Fits perfectly on my countertop next to my sink. Easy set up and easy to use. I rinse my dishes first then use the speed wash setting on the dishwasher. The dishes come out clean even if I overloaded the dishwasher a little. I like the sensor light and the drying function. Usually, the only thing I have to wash by hand is the pots and pans (it's just me and my partner in the household).The main thing I dislike is if I use my faucet sprayer to fill the dishwasher tank, I don't hear the beeping sound that lets you know when it's full, so I use the pitcher provided instead. The other thing I dislike is when the dishwasher isn't running, the power button keeps blinking, so I unplug the dishwasher after a cycle is done. Something that doesn't bother me, but might bother others is the little cup rack doesn't work for a regular size mug. Perhaps it's meant for small tea cups. I just put other items on it like my knives or hamster bowls.Overall, the things I dislike are minor and I am happy with how it cleans the dishes and makes my life easier.",
