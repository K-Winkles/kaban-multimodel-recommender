We've seen many consumers say that other similar products not dissolve completely and leaves a film on the dishes after use. So we test many times and designed Binbata dishwasher sheet. 100% dissolvable & No film left. Do I need to buy extra dishwashing salt and rinse aid? No, our dishwasher sheets contain both dishwashing salts and rinse aid ingredients, so you don't need to buy additional dishwashing salts and rinse aid, you just need one piece of Binbata dishwasher sheet. How many times can I use binbata dishwasher detergent sheets? There're 80 sheets in a box, each sheet can be torn into 2 strips. 1 strip for lightly soiled or small machine load, 1 sheet for medium soiled or medium machine load, 2 sheets for heavily soiled or large machine load, so you can use up to 160 times. Do Binbata dishwasher detergent sheets create a lot of foam? We take a low-foaming formula that will not produce a lot of suds and will not leave residue in the dishwasher. Do I need to pre-wash my dishes? No, pre-wash is generally not required. Unless its really heavily stained.",

                "reviewText": "I honestly wasn't expecting much. I am kind of picky about my laundry detergent, and felt like I would have to sacrifice my morals (I try to buy cruelty free products whenever I can) to get something that works (I normally use Tide hygienic clean pods).This actually works. The sheets dissolve quickly in water and after drying (no fabric softener; I usually use Downy) the scent is very light but still there and really pleasant. I washed my son's clothes to try these sheets, used Haussimple wool balls in the dryer, no fabric softener (he hates scented clothing) and we both really like the result. Clothes came out of the dryer soft and clean and fresh.Also about the scent: we got the citrus one, and someone in their review said it smelled like vomit...? That would be the cleanest smelling vomit in the world then. It actually does NOT smell like any vomit I have ever smelled before. It smells kind of like orange blossoms to me, but just a hint. Not vomit-y at all.And did I mention that the big draw for me to even try them is that they are cruelty free and eco-friendly?I am using up my Tide pods then I am switching over to these sheets completely - I might even give the Tide away. No more Downy either. And I will try this brand's other products too, because I am kind of obsessed now that I have tried this one. Plastic bottles are so 2010.",
