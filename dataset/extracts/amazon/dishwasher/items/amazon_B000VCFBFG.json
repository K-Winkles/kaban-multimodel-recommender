                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Sparkling Clean, Slightly Messy",
                "reviewText": "After switching to Cascade Complete Powder Dishwasher Detergent from a gel version, I've noticed a significant improvement in the cleanliness of my dishes. Here's my take on this product, considering its effectiveness, value, and user experience.Pros:Exceptional Cleaning Power: The most noteworthy aspect of this detergent is its cleaning efficiency. It seems to outperform the gel version I used previously, leaving dishes, glasses, and utensils spotlessly clean with no residue.Great Value: This powder detergent offers excellent bang for your buck. It's reasonably priced and the amount of detergent per box is generous, making it a cost-effective choice for regular use.Efficiency with Tough Stains: It handles tough stains and food remnants remarkably well. Even with heavily soiled items, the dishes come out looking pristine.Cons:Messiness: The powder form can be a bit messy to deal with. Pouring it into the dispenser sometimes leads to spills or powder residue around the area, which requires additional cleanup.Storage Considerations: Due to its powder nature, it's important to store the detergent in a dry place to prevent clumping. This might require some extra attention compared to gel or pod detergents.Measuring Required: Unlike pods, you need to measure the amount of detergent for each load, which might be a minor inconvenience for some users.In summary, Cascade Complete Powder Dishwasher Detergent is a highly effective product that offers great value for money. Its superior cleaning capabilities make it a worthwhile choice, especially for those dealing with frequent or heavily soiled loads. While the powder form might be a bit messier and require careful storage and measuring, the end results in terms of sparkling clean dishes are undeniably impressive. For anyone considering a switch from gel to powder dishwasher detergent, this product is definitely worth trying.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. ### A Stroll Down Memory LaneRemember the time before dishwasher pods took over the cleaning aisle? It was the era of good old-fashioned dishwasher detergent powder, something that seems to have slipped into oblivion with the advent of fancy pods and gels. It's time to rewind and rediscover the magic of Cascade Complete Powder Dishwasher Detergent, the unsung hero in the fight against grimy dishes.### The Pod-Powder ShowdownIt's amusing how dishwasher pods have become the staple, yet they come with their fair share of downsides. They pack in more detergent than necessary, leaving behind a filmy residue that screams 'not clean enough'. Moreover, the promise of a pre-wash with an extra pod feels like a marketing gimmick to burn a hole in your pocket. Now, let\u2019s talk about Cascade Powder. A mere tablespoon (or less, once you get the hang of it) does the trick. It\u2019s a no-brainer; the powder is economical, lasting well beyond the number of washes mentioned on the packaging.### The Pre-Wash WizardrySprinkle a bit on the dishwasher door, a tad more in the detergent compartment, and voila, you\u2019ve set the stage for an effective pre-wash that laughs in the face of food particles clinging onto your dishes. The result? Dishes that come out spanking clean, outshining the half-hearted attempts of pre-measured pods and gels.### Cost and Efficiency, A Rare ComboThe cost-effectiveness of Cascade Powder is a breath of fresh air. It\u2019s dirt cheap, and a box of this magic powder seems to last forever (or several months in my case, well past the 75 washes mark). It\u2019s not just about the cost; it\u2019s about getting cleaner dishes without making a dent in your wallet.### Convenience RedefinedWho said using pods is the epitome of convenience? Grabbing the Cascade box, pouring in a bit of powder is as easy as it gets. There\u2019s no turning back once you experience the simplicity and effectiveness of this powder.### Bottom Line: Ditch the Pods, Embrace the PowderCascade Complete Powder Dishwasher Detergent is a throwback to when things were simpler and, dare I say, better. It\u2019s cheaper, more effective, and throws a knockout punch to the modern-day pods and gels that have been reigning the cleaning aisle. The verdict is clear: it\u2019s time to go back to the basics, and Cascade is leading the way. Say goodbye to the filmy residue and hello to sparkling clean dishes without burning a hole in your pocket.",

                "reviewText": "Used Cascade gel version (21 cents/oz) for years and very happy with cleaning. After last service call on dishwasher I decided to try a different approach and bought the powder version (8 cents/oz). From my experience with soft well water, I used less volume in the soap dispenser and filled the dishwasher with dirty dishes, utensils, etc., no scraping, no pre-wash, etc. The cleaning result was very satisfactory. Using a cardboard box to dispense was not. Looking around my kitchen I spotted the recently emptied orange juice container (2.5 qt with handle version). Problem solved! Makes a great dispenser and easy to handle. Cardboard box went straight to recycle. All in all, a good experience.",

                "reviewText": "Yes, pods are easier. However, I didn't want to add more microplastics to the water supply. I have tried other brands and then switched to this Cascade Complete powder. Even with some caked-on food, my dishes are clean and most of all, my glasses all rinse clean (even without rinse aid). My previous brand regularly left some white powder inside a few drink glasses. This product does not have that problem. This Cascade Complete powder is a powerfully-effective and cost-savvy option!",
