I took off one star not for the product but due to the person that shipped the product didn't bother to tape down the lid and about 1/4th of the detergent spilled all over the rest of the contents of the shipping box. So, it was a mess and I lost a lot of the detergent.",

                "reviewText": "All of the other reviews are 5 stars and they state it cleans well and dries. I beg to differ, at least with my experience using it. For starters there are no directions on it. So you don\u2019t know how much or how little to put in (I\u2019m used to pods). I\u2019ve tried filling the soap compartment to the top, I tried half , I even tried one third and no matter how much or how little I put in my dishes are STILL DIRTY and WET (yes I put drying agent in my dishwasher as well & have never had this issue with the pod version). You\u2019re probably wonder why I ordered this then and not the pods? I needed something ASAP and the liquid had a faster delivery date. I\u2019ve been handwashing all of my dishes as of late. It kind of defeats the purpose of having a dishwasher. Also worth noting my dishwasher is clean, no built up gunk. But anyways that is my experience with this product.",
