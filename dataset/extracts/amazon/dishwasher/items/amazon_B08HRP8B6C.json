All seemed to be well until her roommate discovered water stains on the ceiling in the room below the kitchen. Upon further investigation we found that where the clamp attached the rubber end of this universal dishwasher drain hose to the garbage disposal had torn at the clamp. The rubber is too thin and too soft. We were very unhappy and it resulted in a water leak and stain. Too bad for us. I found an manufacturers original drain hose for nearly the same price and had to replace the one I got on Amazon. We do not recommend this Universal drain hose at all.",
