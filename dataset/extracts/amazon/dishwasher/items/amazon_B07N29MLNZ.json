                "reviewText": "I recently started using Mrs. Meyer's Liquid Dish Soap Refill in the Lemon Verbena scent, and I am absolutely thrilled with the product. It has become an essential part of my daily kitchen routine, and I can't stop raving about it!First and foremost, the fact that this dish soap is made with a biodegradable formula is a game-changer. It's not only effective at cutting through grease and grime on my dishes but also gentle on the environment. Knowing that I'm using a product that is eco-friendly gives me peace of mind, and I love contributing to a greener planet.The Lemon Verbena scent is divine. It's refreshing and leaves my kitchen smelling clean and inviting. The fragrance is not overpowering but just the right amount to make the washing-up process a more enjoyable experience. Plus, it lingers on my dishes, adding a pleasant hint of lemony freshness.The refill format is a fantastic addition. Not only does it save me money, but it also reduces plastic waste, which is a big win for sustainability. The packaging is sturdy and easy to pour, making refilling my existing Mrs. Meyer's bottle a breeze.In terms of performance, this dish soap does not disappoint. It effortlessly tackles tough, stuck-on food residue, leaving my dishes spotless and squeaky clean. A little goes a long way, so this refill bottle lasts a surprisingly long time, making it an economical choice.Overall, I can't recommend Mrs. Meyer's Liquid Dish Soap Refill in Lemon Verbena highly enough. It combines exceptional cleaning power with a commitment to environmental responsibility, all while smelling fantastic. I'm a loyal customer now, and I'm eager to explore more of the Mrs. Meyer's product line. If you're looking for an eco-friendly, effective, and delightful dish soap, this is the one to choose!",

                "reviewText": "Look, I'm not proud of it. Okay, maybe a little. My therapist would say it's a metaphor for embracing the unexpected, my roommate calls it \"the weirdest shower session ever,\" and I simply call it the day I learned my dish soap doubled as a surprisingly effective (honeysuckle scent) body wash.Now, don't get me wrong, this \"MRS MEYER'S CLEAN DAY\" claims to \"conquer grease like a ninja warrior,\" and it does. My once-greasy pans shine like disco balls after a rave. It's the Iron Chef of cutlery cleaning, the Michael Jordan of sudsy slam dunks. But, here's the thing... it also makes you feel unreasonably smooth.last night, out of lavender body wash and desperate for a rinse, I reached for MRS MEYER'S CLEAN DAY liquid dish washing soap. A dollop later, I was enveloped in a honeysuckle monsoon, bubbles clinging to me like miniature disco dancers. But guess what? My skin felt like silk. Like the kind Cleopatra draped herself in, bathed in moonlight and questionable moral decisions.The lather was epic, the scent invigorating (in a \"clean kitchen floor\" kind of way), and my skin? So. Soft. I emerged from the shower a honeysuckle-scented enigma, questioning everything I knew about personal hygiene.Now, I'm not suggesting you ditch your shower gel for dish soap (seriously, moisturize after, people). But this review is a testament to the MRS MEYERS CLEAN DAY liquid soap unexpected versatility. It's a dishwashing detergent, a kitchen sink warrior, and apparently, a secret weapon in the arsenal of accidental self-care.So, if you're looking for a soap that conquers both grease and existential crises, this is your sudsy soulmate. Just don't tell your friends you borrowed it from the kitchen sink. Trust me, it's a conversation starter you won't live down.Rating: 5 stars for cleaning power, 3 stars for questionable life choices, but an undeniable 10 for bathroom disco vibes. And yes, my skin is still ridiculously soft.",

                "reviewText": "Our family has been using Mrs. Meyers cleaning products for many years now. At first, the motivating factor for that is that we live in a home with a septic system. We are very careful about putting chemical detergents down the drain.Now, after years of use, we have come to appreciate the benefits of using a biodegradable product that still affords excellent cleansing power. This product cuts through grease very well. However, since this product is natural, we don\u2019t have to wear protective gloves while doing the dishes. Plus, this dish soap smells AMAZING!As a rule, we tend to buy whichever Mrs. Meyers scent happens to be on sale. They all smell great. Lavender is a clear favorite though. We also like Lemon Verbena.As far as price, buying the bulk size is definitely the route to go. Plus, you will be helping the environment by refilling your existing bottles to reduce plastic consumption. Two thumbs up!",

However, their Basil scent is AMAZING, as well as their Compassion Flower and the Bluebell and the seasonal Apple Cider scent. OMG and the Lemon Verbena is my fave - citrusy and kind of earthy more than floral - my son usually balks at scented dish soap but even he likes that one. But sadly the Peony just didn't do it for me: it started out sweet and light, but then after lathering an odd, kind of salty odor mixed in with the floral, and I am not sure if it was intentionally part of the fragrance, or I got an old or bad batch, or maybe there was something in my water that reacted to something in the formula, or maybe it was my imagination. But I was happy when the jug was finally empty and I could start on one of the other scents I had ordered.It might have been my imagination, or I am sensitive to something in it. Your mileage may vary. It still works really well washing dishes. And Mrs. Meyers always makes this chore more delightful.",
