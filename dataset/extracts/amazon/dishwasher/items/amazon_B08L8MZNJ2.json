Well, I received my pods and when I opened the bag, it was just empty plastic pods and a bag full of loose detergent. Lovely. Worst part is, this product is NONREFUNDABLE AND RETURNABLE so I'd say save the 10 bucks and just pay a little more for a product whose reviews don't say that they are broken open or else you could be like me that gets a bag where they are literally all but 1 broken open and unusable. :(",

                "reviewText": "Usually use cascade gel and more recently cascade tablets. While the tablets clean well, they leave a strong detergent smell on everything, especially on my dishwasher safe food storage containers (plastics hold smells better it seems). The lemon scent cascade is less strong than their \u2018fresh\u2019 scent, but it was still annoying to smell and sometimes taste detergent on the food i kept in those containers.Discovered the palmolive unscented tabs here, just did a load in the dishwasher - cleans just as well as cascade, and just as importantly, does not leave the smell of detergent on what was washed!!! This will be my new brand! Well done, palmolive - well done\u20263/6/22 UPDATE - so like one of the other reviewers, i've recently received two orders of the 60 pack size (at least a few months apart) where the small green liquid 'wings' portion of each pod has burst open, dried up or leaked out into the bag. maybe amazon hasn't been storing these properly and they're sensitive to heat? i've still be using them, and so far doesn't seem to clean less effectively, but time will tell. i've e-mail palmolive about it, to see if it matters or if it can be avoided somehow. assuming they respond, i'll post their response.4/9/22 update - ok, probably too much time spent on dishwashing tablets, but final update (probably) - palmolive responded about a week after an email, they asked for purchase info, lot #, etc, said they\u2019d look into it. They basically said that without the little green liquid sides the tabs still work fine, just not as well. I asked, but they didn\u2019t tell me specifically what the green liquid in the \u2018wings\u2019 section does, just gave me some marketing speak about the tablets effectiveness in general. Anyway, in my own experience, i\u2019ve noticed that the tabs that don\u2019t have the green liquid MAYBE don\u2019t wash quite as well (had 1 or 2 instances of some tiny bits of dried food stuck on even after the wash), but for the most part, the tabs still work, as they noted. In any case, this hasn\u2019t deterred me from keeping this as my go to dishwashing product, and i give credit to them for being responsive.",

It doesn\u2019t leave any strong scents behind, which I appreciate and it cleans grimy dishes that have stuck on food. Usually I run my dishwasher once a week since I have a small household.
