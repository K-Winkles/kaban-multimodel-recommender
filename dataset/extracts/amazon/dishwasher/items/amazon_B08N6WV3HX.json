With just the two of us we decided to try a counter sized. This is perfect! Easy to set up and does a great job. I'm surprised how much I can put in this and everything comes out sparkling clean. This is it's first week so I'll update later. Also love how easy this is to use. This would be great for the elderly for this reason.",

                "reviewText": "AIRMSEN Portable Countertop Dishwasher is a great choice for any small kitchen or apartment. It's lightweight and easy to use and it can easily fit on the countertop or in a cupboard. The dishwashing cycles are powerful and efficient. This dishwasher is an ideal option for anyone who wants to save time and energy when washing dishes. Not to mention, it has an affordable price tag that will fit into anyone's budget. I don't know why I didn't buy this 5 years ago when I moved into my apartment that did not have a dishwasher.****Note For Anyone Experiencing The Following Problem: Upper Spray Arm Not Turning****So I started experiencing a slight problem about 3-4 months into using the dishwasher. The upper spray arm would stop rotating during the cleaning cycle. I emailed the company and they offered the following remedy:The most common culprit as to why the upper spray arm isn't moving is that debris has built up within the inner workings of the upper spray arm. To fix this, remove the lower tray of the dishwasher to freely access the upper spray arm. Then remove the upper spray arm by turning the large screw by hand. After it's removed, clean out any debris that has wrapped around the mounting area for the spray arm. This is usually food particles, hair, and other general buildup. Then check the spout nozzles for any blockages. Use a toothpick or a sharp stick to unclog the individual outlets. Then rinse with water to clean out the dirty things in the spouts. Make sure that each outlet is not clogged and re-install the spray arm using the large screw. Please note that the spouts must be facing down. After installation, first manually rotate the spray arm by pushing the upper spray arm with your finger to check whether it runs smoothly. If it runs smoothly, then the problem is solved.THIS FIXED THE PROBLEM FOR ME! Try this remedy first. If you clean up the upper spray arm and it's still not rotating, contact the company directly on the Airmsen website and report the issue using the form on the Contact US page. I hope this helps.",

Have been using the SPEED function, and the dishes, silver ware, cups, come out spotless. Was easy to hook up the drain hose and drape it into the sink. It runs quietly and efficiently using Cascade gel. Just make sure you have adequate space on your countertop. The dimensions are in the product description. Perfect for a vacation home, a rv, or even in this case for a single family home that needed a dishwasher in a pinch. Compared lots of different portable dishwashers and glad I chose this one. I highly recommend this dishwasher. Great value for the money.",

                "reviewText": "I got this dishwasher for my dry yurt. I have to haul the water, but it uses far less water than running them under a sink. Since I don't have running water, it's difficult for me to rinse my dishes off very well before putting them in the washer. So I have probably pushed this washer to its limit.It does an incredible job on caked-on food, really greasy dishes, and can be loaded very full lol. I have really put this thing through its paces.I've had it for about 3 months with no issues until recently. I did not rinse out my French press well enough, and the coffee grounds clogged a lot of the spouts. This caused water pressure issues and neither arm was spinning. But all it took was detaching and rinsing the arms out mid-cycle, along with cleaning the filter, and it is now working good as new! Luckily I had seen a previous review before I bought it talking about how the dry granulated dishwashing powder caused a similar issue. So I'd recommend a liquid detergent and just be ready for some maintenance cleaning (which I should be doing anyway).I highly recommend this washer for dry cabins/yurts/rvs etc. It saves me hours of time, and gets everything super clean. 10/10 would recommend (without coffee grounds).",

Size and weight wise it's a bit like the old portable televisions- a bulky square. I bought a stainless steel kitchen cart here on Amazon by Amgood that is 18\" square and the height including the wheels on the bottom is an inch or two above the countertops so it's easy to roll over to the sink and gravity drain into it. Filling with the pitcher is easy and the hose easily drapes into the sink. So relieved the days of endless handwashing are over! Highly recommend!!P.S. Using Seventh Generation Dishwasher Packs (powder in pods) have been working great- usually use the Speed wash setting with major food bits wiped off beforehand.",

                "reviewText": "I am so happy with this purchase. I debated for so long about whether to get a countertop dishwasher-would it be worth it for the smaller amount it could hold? Would I regret losing the countertop space? Would I hate the way it looked in my small kitchen? Etc. In the end, my biggest regret is that I didn\u2019t get one years ago. I\u2019ve had this for almost two months now and can\u2019t remember how I managed without it for the last 6 years. I use it at least once a day, sometimes twice and have not had any issues with the machine. It was easy to set up - but quite heavy to carry up the stairs and get up on the counter -fyi. I rinse the dishes well before putting them in and they come out perfectly clean. As recommended by other reviewers, I also use liquid dishwasher soap and havnt had any issues with the arms clogging from undiscovered soap. The machine is fairly quiet - my living room and kitchen are basically one room and I don\u2019t need to turn up the tv volume when this is on. Size-wise, it can fit a lot. Though it takes some trial and error with your dishes to get the best pattern for loading it right. My plates are slightly larger than 10 inches and they don\u2019t fit neatly in the designated spot, bit by leaning them the opposite way I\u2019ve figured out how to get at least 2-3 in there. Honestly, this thing saves me so much time and I\u2019m never stressed about the piles of dirty dishes that used to pile up in my tiny sink every day. If you are debating getting one, do it.",

Die 26cm-Teller muss man aber in den 2 und 3 Schlitz stellen. Am Rand und direkt unter die obere Wasserd\u00fcse passen sie nicht. Hier muss man aber auch sagen, wer 3mal t\u00e4glich isst und dabei jedesmal dreckiges Geschirr hat, da kann es sein, dass man t\u00e4glich sp\u00fclen m\u00fcsste.- Man kann die Maschine irgendwo in der K\u00fcche oder auch im Bad (je nach Platz) aufstellen, da man durch den Wassertank sehr unabh\u00e4ngig ist. Ich z.B. Stelle einfach eine gro\u00dfe Sch\u00fcssel unter den Wasserablaufschlauch und lasse das verbrauchte Wasser reinlaufen, da ich direkt neben der Sp\u00fcle keine Abstellm\u00f6glichkeit habe.- durch den Wassertank wei\u00df ich genau welche Wassermenge verbraucht wird und gerade, wenn man etwas umweltbewusster agieren will, sind ca. 5,7 Liter weniger als man bei einem Abwasch per Hand braucht.- die Lautst\u00e4rke entspricht meiner Meinung nach in etwas der einer gro\u00dfen Geschirrsp\u00fclmaschine. Ich empfinde das Ger\u00e4usch nicht als st\u00f6rend.- nach ca. 3 Wochen Gebrauch bisher keine M\u00e4ngel festgestellt.- Von der Sauberkeit her ist auch kein Unterschied zu einer gro\u00dfen Maschine festzustellen und ich wasche das Geschirr vorher nicht wirklich vor um es dann fast sauber in die Maschine zu stellen. \u00c4Negativ:- f\u00fcr den Preis k\u00f6nnte man sich auch eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Maschine holen (bei gen\u00fcgend vorhandenem Platz und der M\u00f6glichkeit eines Anschlusses), aber da muss man dann auch den h\u00f6heren Wasser-und Stromverbrauch mit einrechnen ( also ist das eigentlich kein wirklich negativer Punkt!)Fazit:Ich w\u00fcrde mir die Maschine bisher wieder holen!",

                "reviewText": "I LOVE this countertop dishwasher! Works so well and saves me so much time, now that I don\u2019t have to wash each and every bowl, plate, and utensil by hand! I have 7 detailed tips below, but here\u2019s the \u201ctoo long didn\u2019t read version\u201d if you\u2019re pressed for time:TLDR: 1-Use gel dishwasher detergent NOT powdered!2-Do not use dishwasher detergent pods\u2014they\u2019re way too large for these small units!3-Rinse well everything you put into this dishwasher! Plates with sticky or dried-on foods or knives with a layer of Mayonnaise still on them may not come completely clean.4-Clean the filter (rinse it) and wipe the unit out regularly with a damp cloth.5-If the top piece of the silverware basket is being a pain, you can remove it\u2014it really doesn\u2019t make much of a difference in how well your silverware gets cleaned.6-If you are able to hook up the supplied hose to your kitchen faucet, do that instead of using the supplied jug to fill the unit with water. It saves time.7-Register your product on Airmsen\u2019s website and they\u2019ll approve you for a 1-year warranty (Amazon gives a 30-day warranty).Now, here\u2019s the detailed version of the tips that have helped me in my 2-month relationship with this dishwasher\u2014he treats me so well! Yes it\u2019s a \u201che\u201d ;)1-He\u2019s happier with gel detergent than with powdered detergent. The manual says that powdered or gel detergent can be used, but that\u2019s not true at all! The powder detergent has small granules that cause his spray arms to get stuck so they stop spinning. If you don\u2019t catch this, he won\u2019t clean your dishes properly for you. You can fix him by manually spinning his arms a few times until you\u2019re confident he can spin them continuously on his own for the rest of the cycle, but this is such a pain and makes him out to be pretty high-maintenance! You get the detergent water all over your hands (not good) and you can\u2019t just start the cycle and walk away cuz you have to babysit him for the first few minutes! If you already have the powdered detergent it\u2019s not the end of the world. Just stir a Tablespoon (and no more) of the powder into a cup of hot tap water before adding it to his main compartment (make sure to pour it into his main compartment NOT into his top water tank AND, wait until he\u2019s drained before adding the detergent\u2014he drains at the start of every cycle). Unfortunately, I bought powdered detergent for him when I first bought him. He didn\u2019t like that so he made me dissolve it in water for each load, but that got old really fast, especially when I was in a hurry! So I went and bought him some gel detergent and since then, he\u2019s been much happier and so have I! Learn from my mistake and you\u2019ll be thankful you did. ;)2-He also doesn\u2019t like dishwasher detergent pods. They\u2019re way too much detergent for him at once and he likely won\u2019t be able to completely dissolve it by the end of his cycle. The detergent holder at the bottom of his door holds about 1 tablespoon of detergent, which is all he needs to wash my dishes perfectly. ;) This is a case of less is more!3-He loves it when I rinse my dishes, silverware and utensils really well. While he works really great, he just doesn\u2019t have the same washing capability as his older brother, the standard home dishwasher (sorry to say buddy), so he can\u2019t reach as many nooks and crannies. Thick layers of grease or sauces, stuck/dried on food particles, and any food particles in general likely won\u2019t be washed off completely. Tip: rinse dishes, silverware and utensils as soon as you\u2019re done with them or leave them to soak if you won\u2019t be putting a load of dishes on right away. This has saved me lots of time and elbow grease! ;)4-Make sure to clean his filter and give him a sponge bath regularly. Every 1-2 loads for his filter and every 3-5 loads for sponge baths. The less gunk in his filter, the easier it is to clean. And, I wasn\u2019t cleaning him as often as I should have and I\u2019ve noticed he has hard water deposits now.5-Sometimes I take away the top piece of his silverware basket if it\u2019s being bad. It\u2019s not always needed and it detaches from the basket base far too easily. Besides, I don\u2019t find it makes a huge difference in how well this guy\u2019s able to clean my silverware\u2014he makes it squeaky clean every time with or without that top piece, and I usually have a good amount of silverware in each load (at least 7 pieces).6-If I had the option to hook up the hose that came in his box to my kitchen faucet, I would much prefer to do that vs using the jug that also came with him. He\u2019s pretty thirsty and using a jug to quench his thirst can be a bit of a pain, but he\u2019s worth it I suppose. ;)7-I\u2019ve registered him on the Airmsen website. Airmsen offers a 1-year warranty, while Amazon offers a 30-day warranty. It\u2019s definitely worth it if he breaks after the 30 days! I hope he doesn\u2019t though, cuz he\u2019s the best relationship (aka purchase) I\u2019ve ever had\u2014hands down! ;)Hope these tips helped you and if they did, please mark my review as helpful! I\u2019ll be sure to add more tips I learn along the way in my relationship with this special guy! ;) Thanks for reading! :)",

                "reviewText": "Bought this for my small apartment that does not have room to add an instal a regular dishwasher.This one works very well. The dishes are clean, and although you have to play a bit of Tetris with your dishes, you can fit a good amount in the rack. Couple things to note:- The water tank needs 5L of water to function; they provide a measuring mug, but the appliance also lets you know when more water is need/enough was added.- The spinning jets are mechanical, meaning they turn with the water pressure. I\u2019ve noticed that the top one doesn\u2019t always turn properly, but I think the fix is to make sure it is tightened well enough so the water doesn\u2019t seep out of the connection.Overall, perfect for small spaces, and singles/couples.",
