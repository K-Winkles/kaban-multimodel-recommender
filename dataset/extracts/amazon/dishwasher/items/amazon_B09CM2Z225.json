Please not on the photos there is no gasket or sealant between the element and brass nut; the corrosion starting after initial use; the water drops on the INSIDE of the PVC nut since the water is dripping off the wire and inside the nut. This is part cannot work and is a fire hazard. I know this since I have had two electrical connectors already burn on the original part. I was home both times - thank God.
