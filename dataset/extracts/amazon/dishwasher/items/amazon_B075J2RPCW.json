The lemon scent is very refreshing and not overly strong; it provides a fresh smell in the laundry room. There is no visual residue, however, because some reviewers mention having allergic reactions to washer cleaning products, I do run a full wash cycle after cleaning just to be certain that there isn't any residue on the drum. Plink does not remove any staining on the door seal and inner rubber ring. You will need to place a bleach soaked rag on the inner seal and leave overnight to remove most of the staining.",

However the last 5 or 6 orders I\u2019ve gotten, when I open the package, the disc appears to have some specks of mold. I obviously don\u2019t want to clean my dishwasher with a moldy product so I don\u2019t use those. But I\u2019ve gotten packages where 3/4 discs have mold specks. It sucks because I like this product and use it frequently but now it seems like a waste of money since I\u2019m not using the entire thing.",

                "reviewText": "I do like this product overall and I may very very well purchase it again, however I must share that as you remove each tablet from the cardboard 1/4 of the tablet crumbles. I don't care how careful I have done it always crumbles and I'm not sure why this is occurring but I purchased several packs and I thought maybe I got a bad pack but it happens to every single tablet I removed from the cardboard. It would be nice, if the company would provide replacement tablets for the order I placed since I probably lose one tablet out of every packet to crumbling. The scent is nice, but I feel the cost is a little higher than what the product is worth. Yes, I would recommend it to a friend as long as they know that the product will crumble. And, as I previously said I may or may not purchase it again I am undecided at this time.",
