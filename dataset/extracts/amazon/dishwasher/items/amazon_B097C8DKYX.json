I was optimistic since I tried their laundry detergent, and it's been working great for months now, so I hoped their dishwashing powder would work just as well. I was still a little skeptical since I have very hard water here in Arizona and other dishwasher powders and pods (even Cascade) would leave white residue and forced me to have to use an extra rinse aid to get them clean. But I'm happy to say that after trying Nellie's powder (even without a rinse aid!) they come out just as clean, and even better it doesn't leave any gross strong-smelling soap fragrance on my dishes. Great price too for the amount you get - I'll definitely be buying the larger quantity once I run out. Would absolutely recommend!",

I had tried adding more, adding less, absolutely rinsing everything off before putting the items in the dishwasher, and using the hottest setting possible with an extra rinse setting and my dishes never come out clean. There is a film on them and they feel just gritty and dirty. Glass is cloudy and weird looking after using this stuff. I have never had a problem with any other dishwashing soda, or detergent. Will be returning.",

It turns out Samsung just makes crappy dishwashers and require soaps with harsh chemicals to do most of the work. Upgraded to a Bosch 300 series and tried the soap again and it cleans 90% as well as the big brand name dish soaps with all the harsh chemicals. This soap does have a tougher time with dried stuck on food when dishes are left overnight sitting on the counter. Running a soak/rinse cycle prior to washing helps a lot for those situations. For the most part this soap has no strong perfumes and leaves glass wear sparkling. When I use this soap I run on Heavy setting with Sanitize + Extra dry and results are great even with heavy greasy dishes. For Dried stuck on foods this soap will struggle a bit.",
