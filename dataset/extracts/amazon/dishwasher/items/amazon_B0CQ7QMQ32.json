                "reviewText": "For the past couple of years I've been on the hunt to find the perfect spatula, as I broke my favorite one during a cookie dough incident which worked a little too hard one day and broke straight in my batter. I also wanted to replace a couple of my everyday plastic cooking utensils since they're looking a bit beat. Thanks to Amazon Vine, I got the opportunity to test these out to see if they will reign as one of the supreme tools of choice!Upon receipt, I received the kindest pair of utensils ever, and I appreciate they came with a couple of hooks I could use if I wanted to hang them up anywhere in my kitchen (shelves, or otherwise). The first thing I noticed was they have a light texture but it's a soft finish, so it made me wonder if they'll be difficult to clean at all. The handles are wood with a light satin coating, and I'm still thinking I may need to smooth them a bit as my thick winter skin saved me from a splinter. That puppy didn't have a chance besides pop right off.I cook and/or bake at least 2-3x a day and have used them continuously for the past week. I'm happy to report, after a tomato based sauce, heavily staining extracts, oils, rice, brown sauces and more, they haven't showed any indication that they will stain. I understand, this will probably change with time, so I intend on updating this review if that should occur. For me, they have thicker centers, nice solid curves and I find they work better for lighter batters, soups, stir frys, things you want to be able to toss in larger quantities and transferring your food onto a plate/bowl, without losing any of the tasty bits. They're not so much for starting off with cookie, or bread dough (at least for me right now) because there's a stiffness in them that doesn't bend completely to the shape of small and medium-sized bowls.Will these replace my favorite spatula? No. I'm giving them another week, but I actually don't see myself reaching for my old plastic cooking utensils anytime soon, so I might as well get them ready for the garbage or donations!",

                "reviewText": "It really is just what I needed. Size is perfect for what I use it for. When I ordered, I didn\u2019t even realize it came with hooks. So that was a pleasant surprise! It looks well made and I am very picky with how thick the handles are and I am happy with their handles. My only issue is, it is a little hard to remove spots from the spoon and I feel like the white one will eventually stain at some point.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been replacing my old plastic utensils with nicer silicon ones. This set is perfect with the spatula/spoon combo. They are very sturdy and should last a long time. The silicon ends are thick not flimsy. I did put the white one in spaghetti sauce and let it sit for a couple of hours. It did stain, but it is so faint you would have to know what to look for. Overall these are a great set of utensils.",

                "reviewText": "I have been eager to find the spoon/spatula combo known as a spoonula since seeing them on TV and they are everything I hoped they would be. Use it as a spatula, use it as a spoon, or in baking you can often use it as both. Perfect for mixing and scraping the sides of jars and bowls. These are food safe and heat resistant and I can find uses for them all day long. Great!",

                "reviewText": "Love these silicone cooking spoons. They're larger than our old standard-sized ones. Its large and wide size is not quite as large as the bbq grill ones we have outside. They're just big enough to fit on our kitchen spoon-rest. But yet the scooping parts are deeper and longer than our standard silicone cooking spoons. So, they can scoop and mix bigger servings of stews, rice, ground beef, and stir fry with ease on our non-stick pots and pans. My chef husband absolutely appreciates them. He actually donated our older silicone spoons recently, after about a week of using these. Got the blue & white ones. He plans on getting more of these set for his work kitchen.Greatly recommended.",
