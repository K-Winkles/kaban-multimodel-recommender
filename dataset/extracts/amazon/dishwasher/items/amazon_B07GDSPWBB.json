                "reviewText": "I have tried tons, literally dozens, of all natural laundry detergents. Never have been totally happy. I tried this on a whim, hnestly not expecting much. I was so wrong! It got stubborn smells out of my husband's shirts (armpit odor), got our cloth diapers clean and odor free, and tomato sauce almost completely out in one wash with no pretreatment. It also completely removed a mud and other various unknown food stains in one wash no pretreatment. Then I tried it in the dishwasher. Dishwasher funk was gone, and it got my plastic compost bin clean and fresh which is almost impossible to do. So then I started cleaning all kinds of stuff. Soaked our sinks, which were \"clean\", and the water turned brown. Ewe. I also soaked the kids' tub toys, and got my stainless sink sparkly again. Our basement shower is next on my list. Best of all, it smells nice while you're cleaning with it, but leaves no scent when it's done and rinsed. Great for sensitive skin like our family, and also sensitive noses. My daughter recently had a meltdown after I washed her blanket in baby detergent that smelled like powder. I re washed with Powerizer and she said it was \"fresh\" again. I just ordered a case of this stuff. My new go to! Oh, one negative- I did find it left our clothes a smidge coarse, so I add in a tablespoon of Zote soap flakes to our wash.UPDATE: it also cleaned the basement shower really well, which is painted concrete with a plastic patio floor. All of got fresh and clean. Very happy! I will continue to use this product and hope it doesn't get discontinued",

                "reviewText": "I don't give five stars for much, but this stuff is amazing. Everything I've used it on so far is cleaner than it was with any other products. I have hard water and all the problems that go along with that. In order to get my whites bright I had to create a concoction with different laundry products to make that happen and I would only get so-so results, but I use two scoops in my giant washing machine and my whites are blinding. I actually did soak some things that were badly stained and was stunned when the stains were gone. Have used it to dissolve hard water deposits in my tub and use it as my dishwasher detergent. Only half a scoop for that, the dishes look great, in the inside of the dishwasher is nice and clean.I'm still finding uses for it, but so far it's well worth it for the few things I do use it for.",

My son works at a restaurant and is constantly coming home with the smell of oil and chicken on his clothes. I had to re wash his work clothes with my go to Gain to get the smell/stains out. This is very expensive for the money so I probably wouldn't buy it again. I have not tried it for any other uses around the house.",

The stains came out.I\u2019ve been using it for laundry more often now and I\u2019m about to start using it as a spray cleaner as well. I tend to use mrs Meyers as well as a lemon oil cleaner and windex for various things. Let\u2019s see how this stacks up on all purpose cleaning. I\u2019m also going to start spraying my toilets with this before using the toss away pod things that attach to the stick. If they work I\u2019ll use one pod per 2 toilets just as a wipe down.",

Our first load of Powerizer scrubbed these off but did leave a bit of residue on a washcloth. I would recommend that if you have the scum build up - run a preliminary load to remove potential stains. After that one time, it cleans perfectly. For dishwasher we notice that with Finish or other detergents there seems to be a slight haze to the stainless steel hub. Powerizer leaves the dishes very clean and shines up the washer significantly. We also use in our carpet cleaner - making sure the mixture is thoroughly dissolved before pouring into the cleaning fluid container. We also use the liquid concentrate for spotting on the carpet and it works well. In general we are very pleased!",

Clothes come out smelling like ... nothing. No perfumes, no chemicals, just clean. There's no static cling when they leave the dryer, so no fabric softener is needed. I usually press the the autosoak button for very soiled items.Carpet - I follow the directions, using very hot tap water, to make a gallon and fill a spray bottle. Don't screw the lid on the bottle or the expanding \"power\" can do harm to the mechanism. Saturate stains, let them set. Next, I use the shampooer, with either clear water or carpet cleaner. Make sure the stained areas are rinsed very well. If you have any leftover solution, pour it in the toilet, bathtub, or shower, and let it soak.Stained Flower Vase - Sprinkle a few granules in the bottom and fill with hot water. Wait for a few minutes and watch the magic.Hard floors - I don't use it for this because by the time I've finished mopping, I'm too tired to rinse. I'm sure the floor would look great if I did!",
