                "reviewText": "One of our cable strings broke and then the dishwasher opened dangerously quick. I looked all around for the best replacement and came up with this product. Does the job. Fairly easy to install if you're able to pull out the dishwasher about 6 inches. Noticed the other cable was starting to fray as well so I'm glad I received a pair to replace them both! Not sure how long they'll hold up, but if as long as the originals, it should last until I'm ready for a new dishwasher!",
