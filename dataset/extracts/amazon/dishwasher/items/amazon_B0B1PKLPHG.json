                "reviewText": "I really wanted to switch to something less harmful to me and the environment, but there's no beating cascade. Please note I have an old crappy dishwasher and hard city water. I live in an apartment with no water softener. This product does a great job at cleaning plates and cups that do not have anything tough on them like coffee rings or dried food, but if you have tough stains or let things sit in the dishwasher this will not remove the grime. I even tried 2 pods with added citric acid. Even after three washes the same cup was still stained and dirty. If you methodically rinse all your dishes, don't have stained cups, just use your dishwasher for sanitation after washing dishes yourself, or have a newer dishwasher with soft water these may work great for you. But for most people without those things you're going to have to either scrub before you put into the dishwasher or after.If you wipe and clean everything off your plates and don't let coffee cups sit around and run your dishwasher daily before stains set this is your product. If not though don't expect this to work magic like a cascade platinum pod.I am still giving 5 stars because this is a great product. I love the scent and that it doesn't contain harmful ingredients. I'm impressed the scent is only essential oils! Exactly what I wanted. Once I get soft water and have to run my dishwasher more frequently I think these will be perfect. Currently though I'm lazy and throw things in the dishwasher haphazardly and only run it every 3-5 days.For improvement I would say they need to add something to assist stain removal for cups and add more water softening agents. Maybe even a hard and soft water version. If it would remove hardened food and coffee cups stains I'd switch to this in a heartbeat.",

One of my favorites brands! It will definitely get your dishes clean. We choose to use the unscented, but they do have other options to choose from. Great value in price for a cleaner alternative.",
