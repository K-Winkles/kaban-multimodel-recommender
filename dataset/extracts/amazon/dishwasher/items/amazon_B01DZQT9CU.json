                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Durable and reusable silicone bags!",
                "reviewText": "Stasher silicone bags are a good quality expensive reusable option for food (and not only). The bags are very versatile, the limit being just the size; I use them to store, carry, freeze, refrigerate, warm-up, cook food and anything in between. The silicone is quite thick, but still somewhat flexible; the thick silicone makes them really durable, but I would still advise care to not scratch or puncture the surface with something very sharp.The Stasher bags make a great addition to my plastic free reusable items collection of household items.Overall, I wouldn't consider them that great for voluminous items, since the silicone is quite thick and the opening quite narrow. And if you pack too much stuff in them the pinch-lock can easily open; but if you don't over stuff the bags the seal is air-tight. Still, personally I won't store liquids like soup in them.I personally wash them in the dishwasher and they always come out 100% clean. I just make sure that I `spread` out the opening as much as I can without putting stress on the silicone. I never noticed gunk hiding in the crevices of the pinch-lock or around the corners; and since mine are transparent, they would be easy to spot. If I leave them stretch-opened in the dishwasher, they dry out completely.Depending what I stored in the bags, they do get some staining in time; but I consider this part of the regular wear and tear.Otherwise, my bags were used hundreds of times in the freezer, microwave and oven, without any issues.Snack size:The snack size is pretty small, it's more usable for portioned snacks (puffs, nuts, crackers, dried fruit, homemade granola bars). It's quite sleek, so it fits in bags and backpacks, while keeping items safe. If you sit on the bag you'll crush the puffs/crackers, but otherwise they do help with keeping snacks from crumbling.I used sometimes to freeze smaller portions of fruits or half of an avocado.It's the perfect size to bring vitamins and supplements to a week long vacation/travel.Sandwich size:The sandwich size is the most versatile for me. I use it to store small portions of meats and veggies/fruits in the freezer. I use it for leftovers in the fridge. I use it to carry snacks, from rice cakes, to carrots, sugar snap peas, crackers, puffs. I use it for bread and sandwiches; the bag fits regular sized sandwich bread, but it's too large for thin sliced small portioned ones and not big enough for super-sized slices; if you make huge over-stuffed sandwiches, they won't fit in the bag.Besides storing bread, the bag is great for reheating stale or frozen bread in the oven. I pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees, put the bread/buns locked in the bag for 7-8 minutes and get back crusty warm delicious bread. I bet it works for (non-glazed) donuts and pastries as well.I also cooked eggs in the sandwich size bags, both in the microwave and in boiled water. The eggs are really fluffy when cooked in the Stasher bags.Big size (1/2 gallon):I mostly use the big size to freeze large quantities and sizes of veggies (great for long one like green beans and asparagus).But the best use for the 1/2 gallon bag for me is making popcorn. I just put in the salt and the popcorn kernels, run my microwave popcorn program for 3-4 minutes, and get perfectly popped popcorn each time; you can add oil or butter if you like, but it's not mandatory. I would repurchase this bag again and again just to use it for popcorn. Mine started getting brown stains from all the times I made popcorn in it.Another great use for the big size is steaming veggies in the microwave for a quick meal. It works for green beans and smaller broccoli and cauliflower florets.Stand-Up:This is definitely the most versatile bag, from pantry to freezer, from produce to soups. It can hold a large diversity of dry bulk goods, rice, beans, smaller pasta, crackers, nuts, cereal. Fruits and smaller (or cut) veggies fit perfectly both for fridge and freezer storage. They are great for meal prep, both for storing food and for taking it along (although the opening won't allow too much flexibility from eating straight from the bag). In the big one I can store even whole cut watermelons and halves of spaghetti squash.I have purchased various sizes from Amazon both individual bags and sets, usually when there's a deal around. I have reviews for different sizes with the same overall comments, but specific considerations depending on the size.",

These bag are durable and easily cleaned in the dishwasher (make sure to prop open by separating the opening across a few spokes). If you don't close them the right way they pop open. The instinct is to slide your thumb and forefinger along the \"zipper\" the way you do with commercial sandwich bags. Instead, what you need to do is press the seal together inch by inch. It only takes an extra second but this ensures they stay closed. My only complaint is that they are a bit bulky and i haven't figured out a neat way to store them.",

                "reviewText": "After using it for a couple months, here are my findings:Sturdy bags that can hold and keep many different types of food; they save space on the fridge; they have a very tight seal (they keep liquids provided you\u2019re sensible and don\u2019t squeeze them too hard, they do take some level of pressure without opening no problem); They go on the freezer and they do fit a lot depending on what you\u2019re using them for.They have always been leakproof for what I use them - I never traveled with a bag full of soup in my backpack tho, so I don\u2019t know your standards/ideas on leakproof. Fruits, cookies and sandwiches/bagels are fine to travel tho. Also for seasoning/marinating stuff overnight in the fridge they work great.The opening is finicky but that\u2019s what makes the seal really good, so you have to pick your battles, and I never had any problems on transporting sandwiches - if it\u2019s cut in half and arranged nicely.To take the contents out just press the corners into each other and the opening should suffice. They are tight. If they\u2019re not tight, they won\u2019t be leakproof. Get a bigger model if you want more space, you can\u2019t have it all.They\u2019re ok to clean, but drying silicone bags out is a bit of a pain in general, you have to stack them upside down on a glass or something and forget them there for a good few hours. Not a deal breaker but could be improved. Maybe selling then with a thin stand/dish rack add-on to dry them? I don\u2019t know.I don\u2019t use my Stasher for cooking/boiling/microwaving so I can\u2019t comment on that.I bought cheaper ones to compare and I like them as well, but the Stasher does work and feel a bit better, specially on closing and opening, maybe the silicone quality is what does it, you do feel the slightly difference in touch/feel of the material. The seal seems pretty much the same and they\u2019re equally useful to me.They\u2019re dishwasher safe but I ended up always washing by hand for some reason so I also can\u2019t comment on that.If you don\u2019t want them for cooking/boiling, consider buying cheaper brands, they perform very similarly and are WAY cheaper - I got this one for \u00a311 and the cheaper ones were a set of 3 for \u00a315.I gotta say tho I really like the Stasher bag and although they\u2019re are a bit overpriced, if they last as they seem to do, it\u2019s well worth the investment. As it is, I would recommend/ buy more of them, great experience overall.",
