The setup was not too difficult coming from someone who\u2019s never done something like this before. I even found a few useful installation videos from Honeywell\u2019s YouTube channel.I would like to note that your experience with this dishwasher might vary depending on what dishwasher cycle you run, detergent you use, and how dirty the dishes are. This dishwasher does clean really well, but I\u2019ve found that on certain dishes that have been dirty for several days, this dishwasher will not completely clean them and you might need to clean by hand.All in all, if you need an 18 inch dishwasher, you can\u2019t go wrong with this one for the price.",

                "reviewText": "We have a small kitchen so when we did the remodel we wanted to size down the dishwasher to fit in a full sized sink base. We did a lot of research and decided on this unit. It's incredibly short. We had to raise it all the way up to have it reach the appropriate height and my husband had to carefully place the toe kick to hide the amount of space between the bottom of the dishwasher and the floor. It runs incredibly quiet, we can't hear it at all unless we are in the kitchen, and the rapid cycle does a great job. However, it's been installed since July and the motherboard just went out on it--less than a year. Honeywell is sending a replacement unit which is appreciated but still a pain in the neck and extra work for my husband to remove and install. Hopefully the new unit lasts longer than this one did.",

I am really glad that i did, the unit arrived in perfect condition, no dents or anything like that. So shipping, not a problem.Appearance and dimensions, the description and the pictures are accurate, it looks great in the kitchen.It cleans the dishes well, even when i did not rinse the dishes before loading the dishwasher, just to see how it will do.I have only just had it installed so i cannot comment on how well it will do long term, but so far i do recommend this dishwasher, due to its appearance and how well it cleans, not to mention the price, it was actually cheaper than most other 18 inch dishwashers, so if you are like me and are worried about ordering an appliance on Amazon, i tried it and it was a completely positive experience for me.",
