Clean streak free & residue free dishes every time! I've been using these for years and will continue to use them.They are surprisingly powerful and can handle really dirty dishes. If you have something that is sticky or very greasy though I would recommend wiping that down before putting it in the dishwasher with a tab. While these are strong and the best detergent pods I have used, they are not perfect at getting absolutely everything. Highly recommend these, they have a nice light fresh smell also! Good quality product for a decent price, 94 tabs should last a while.",

                "reviewText": "These are indeed the foil wrapped pods (thank goodness). I've been using these for over 10 years since I bought my Kitchenaid dishwasher. They were recommended by the manufacturer at the time. They always get my dishes perfectly clean (I do pre-rinse them for good measure).They leave no film in the dishwasher. My dishwasher still looks brand new inside. No residue.When these foil wrapped pods were discontinued at all of the local stores, I tried the other \"dissolving\" pods, and within a few washes, I noticed a buildup in the dishwasher. Gross. After doing my own research, I determined that the outer casing (that's supposed to dissolve) essentially gets diluted into the water and redeposited on everything. Sometimes it doesn't all dissolve and leaves a film. You are eating it off your dishes!It's not good for the internal pumps and valves, and will lead to premature wear and plumbing problems of your appliance. This was confirmed by several repairmen and handymen (as well as my own common sense). One guy told me 1 out 4 calls is a pump failure (dishwashers and clothes washers) with either goo or partially dissolved pod shells jammed inside from the modern \"dissolving\" pods.My dishwasher and washing machine are still on their original pumps, and I'd like to keep it that way thank you.To open these pods, just tear the foil like a piece of paper. I find that simple, but it might be harder for those with dexterity problems. In this case, I recommend using gel liquid or powder with enzymes as the main ingredient (not bleach) instead of the dissolving pods.For those who complain that the foil pouches spill powder when opening, yes, that happens. Fairly often. Even if the pod comes out busted up, that doesn't matter! Powder is powder! It will still clean the dishes. Dump it in the detergent tray and move on with life. Back in the old days, dishwasher detergent was only sold as powder in a box. These foil wrapped pods are just compressed powder into a cube.For those who think it makes a mess when the powder spills on the floor, I learned that lesson 10 years ago. The simple \"life hack\" is to tear open the foil over the detergent tray. That way, if some spills when I open the foil, it will just go into the dishwasher where it belongs. Problem solved. Excess powder that misses the tray can contribute to the prewash. Another hidden benefit.Life seems to be a trade between convenience and longevity. Smart people find ways to get both. Not-so-smart people buy a new appliance every 3-5 years. Your choice.",
