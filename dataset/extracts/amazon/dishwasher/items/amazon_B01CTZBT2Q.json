Surprisingly impressive, especially when considering the significant price point difference.Cascade holds its ground against Finish Jet Dry when it comes to delivering streak-free, sparkling dishes. I've noticed no compromise in the quality of the shine, and it effectively prevents water spots \u2013 a win in my book.What sets Cascade apart is its unbeatable price. The value for money is remarkable, making it an attractive choice for those of us who appreciate a budget-friendly option without sacrificing performance. In direct comparison, Cascade offers a wallet-friendly alternative that doesn't skimp on delivering that coveted polished finish.While Finish Jet Dry is undeniably a quality product, Cascade proves that you don't need to break the bank for exceptional results. If you're all about maximizing value without compromising on shine, give Cascade a shot \u2013 your dishes and your wallet will thank you. A clear winner in terms of performance and affordability! \ud83d\udc4d",

                "reviewText": "Bear with me here while I share with you my dishwashing saga.Okay, so, I am the woman who quit using her dishwasher because of waterspots! I tried several national brand drying agents (I won't name shame them here), but I had never tried Cascade Platimum Drying Agent. I had tried Cascade Platinum Dishwasher Pods and they worked well, for cleaning the dishes at least, but the water spots were killing me. I was spending 20-30 minutes essentially polishing the plastic and glass dishes that came out of the dishwasher regardless of the drying cycle used (heat, high heat, or air). So, as if it would hurt the dishwashers feelings, I decided I could spend 20-30 minutes simply doing my dishes manually (yep the old sink and water method) and not additional time rinsing them off, loading the dishwasher, then running it, waiting, then 20-30 minutes of, you guessed it water spot removal before putting the dishes away!So, last night was the test. Not only did I NOT RINSE the dishes before loading the dishwasher (and there was a dirty cutting board with onion and pepper residue and juice all in there, as well as bowls with the last bit of grits (yes, white corn, stone ground grits were left in the bowls, you know the ones that you can't get on the utensil no matter how hard you try because they are in an intimate affair with the bowl), and as you see in the pictures, a BLACK CERAMIC CROCKPOT INSERT! (With peppersteak residue, unrinsed!).I ran the dishwasher on a normal cycle with a heat dry setting which uses the heat from the washing cycle to dry the dishes (if you leave the door closed long enough).My curiosity got the best of me though, and open the door almost as soon as the cycle had stopped, I did. And of course, steam rolled out, my glasses fogged up, and I couldn't see if there was food residue or water spots! So, I reluctantly closed the door, and as hard as it was not to look again, I waited until this morning.Imagine my surprise when I opened the door to the dishwasher and it was if I heard dishwasher angels singing the \"We are the Champions\" song, you know the one, yep, that one that you are now singing in your head (sorry, not sorry)! I almost wanted to cry, tears of joy! I immediately grabbed my phone so I could record this most triumphant moment in dishwashing history forever!The proof is in the pictures, folks! Although, I can say with a certain degree of certainty that this beautiful combination of Cascade Platinum dishwashing Pods and Drying Agent weren't 100% successful with the water spots, they were 100% successful at food residue removal, and at least 92.5% successful with water spot removal. That being said, I only spent about 1-2 minutes wiping off minimal water spots (on some plastic bowls, that I was too excited to think about taking more detailed pictures of, but trust me, the spits were minimal).So, to Cascade Platinum Production Workers! I say thank you!!!! Thank you for giving me my life back (well at least the 2 to 3 hours a day I spent handwashing, drying, and putting away dishes, because I would wash breakfast, lunch, and dinner dishes after each meal). You have also made water conservation a new thing in my house, and imagine how happy my dishwasher angels will be when they get to rejoice in song (here we go with \"We are the Champions\", and again, sorry, not sorry)\ud83d\ude01.I say all of this, so you will know how grateful I am to not have dishpan hands any longer (Oh! the money I will save not having to buy rubber gloves!), and how you have helped this woman with her OCD over dishwasher waterspots regain some normalcy and time in her life by simply doing EXACTLY what you say that you will do, dramatically decrease the likelihood of waterspots after a dishwasher cycle has been run! (Not that that is really exactly what you say, but you get my drift).Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!",
