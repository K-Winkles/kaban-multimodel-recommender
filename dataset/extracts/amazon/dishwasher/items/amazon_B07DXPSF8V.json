These pods combine powerful cleaning abilities with a commitment to natural ingredients, making them a standout choice for anyone seeking a greener and safer alternative.One of the most notable features of these pods is their gentle formulation.

They effortlessly tackle tough food stains, leaving my dishes sparkling clean after every wash. I've also noticed a significant reduction in water spots and film on glassware, a testament to their effectiveness.Another standout feature is the convenience of the pre-measured pods. They eliminate the need for messy liquid or powder detergents, ensuring that I use just the right amount for each wash. This not only saves time but also prevents any potential waste, making them an eco-conscious choice.The commitment to transparency and sustainability from the brand is evident in their eco-friendly packaging. The use of recyclable materials reinforces their dedication to reducing environmental impact, which aligns perfectly with my own values.In summary, Free and Clear Natural Detergent Dishwasher Pods have become an essential part of my household routine. Their gentle yet effective cleaning power, combined with their natural formulation, make them a top-notch choice for anyone seeking a safer and greener dishwasher detergent option.

There is no residue left on my glasses as there was with the big box store brand I used to use, so I don't have to rinse the glass before I use it. I had noticed a slight foaminess in my water unless I rinsed the glass first. Ridiculous to have to do that - and now I don't. And it also doesn't have a strong chemical smell like any of the other commercial brands I have tried. I feel much better knowing I can use a product that isn't harmful to me, to the environment, or to my septic system. All good!",

                "reviewText": "I have run five loads using this detergent and it barely cleaned the dishes. Each time, I had hand wash everything all over again. I tried doing a more thorough job rinsing the dishes, but that did not help. It simply does not clean the dishes. I have an water-saving dishwasher, so perhaps it works okay in machines that use more water. It is a shame, because I wanted to switch to a more environmentally friendly product. I think I will go back to Cascade for the time being....As I indicated in my last review, these did not work for my machine, but I wanted to see if they would work on my partner's machine to see if it works on his. And it did! He says that the dishes turned out well-washed, possibly better than his previous TJ pods. Additionally, the dishwasher itself looks cleaner. So 5 stars for him and 1 star for me. My dishwasher is IKEA and his is KitchenAid. I hope this is helpful.",
