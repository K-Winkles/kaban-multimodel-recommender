I found it reminsicient of Anthony Bordein's 'Kichen Confidential' in its informed depicition of the inner workings of the kitchen and life in the restaurant industry.Full of colorful, seedy characters and overshadowed by addiction, it's hard not to empathize with the hard-working protagonist even if you don't know why.",
