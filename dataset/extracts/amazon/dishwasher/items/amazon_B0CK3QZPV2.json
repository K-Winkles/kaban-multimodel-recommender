I was using power wash but now I can use the normal wash option. The pods are delicate but that makes them good as well since they completely dissolve. I took them out of the bag they came in and placed them in a container. I read others say they were broken so I handle them cautiously. I will buy again. I also added the Lemi shine booster, which didn\u2019t help the old detergent much but works great with these pods. The old dishwashers didn\u2019t need all this help\u2026.new ones suck.",

                "reviewText": "Before I discovered Lemishine, my dishes never seemed clean and almost always had a film and a salty taste- and we were THOUGHT we were using the \u201cgood stuff\u201d. But after I discovered LemiShine Dishwasher Detergent over 10yrs ago, I REFUSE to buy anything else!! Unfortunately, it\u2019s hard to find at my local stores so I have to order it from Amazon. Sad to see so many of the reviews give this amazing product bad reviews because of broken pods that were most likely caused by rough handling.But a suggestion for those who stated they still had dirty dishes after using Lemishine (or dishwasher detergent), clean your dishwasher filter. Yes, there\u2019s a filter at the bottom of your dishwasher and it\u2019s SUPER gross \ud83e\udd22. Then try the Lemishine Dishwasher Cleaner. It\u2019ll clean your dishwasher like new and I promise you\u2019ll notice cleaner dishes thereafter! I always highly recommend Lemishine dishwasher detergent to my family and friends. I love what an amazing job it does and the safe ingredients.",

                "reviewText": "In terms of how well they clean, these are probably the best dishwasher pods I\u2019ve tried. I switched to them after the brand I\u2019d been using for years changed their formula and started leaving residue on my dishes. After trying one other brand that didn\u2019t help at all, I decided to give this a shot, and it made an I credible difference. The dishes come out as clean as ever, and now without any hard water or detergent residue on them, and as an added bonus, the inside of my dishwasher stays noticeably cleaner now.My one complaint, and the reason this isn\u2019t a 5-star review, is that the pods themselves aren\u2019t very sturdy. I haven\u2019t had the liquid side of them pop before, but probably one in four of them was already leaking from the powder side when I got them. I\u2019ve had multiple bags now, and this was an issue on all of them. It\u2019s not too problematic though, you basically just have to pour some of the loose powder from the bag to supplement any time you pull out a leaky pod.",
