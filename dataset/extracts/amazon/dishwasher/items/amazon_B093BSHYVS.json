                "reviewText": "The top of the filter looks a bit different and for that matter so does the grooving on the bottom, but it works perfect. My pic shows my original which had never been cleaned in 10yrs in Phoenix. Who reads dishwasher manuals? I didn't even know it had filters that I was supposed to clean. The washing has been bad the last year and the last month it hadn't been draining water. Research uncovered this, completely calcified with Phoenix hard water. Getting the old one out, breaking the calcified seal was a pain, but this new one went right in!Clean your dishwasher filters, folks.",
