Nonetheless, I wanted a way to quickly know whether the dishes were clean or dirty.I thought about adding a magnet to the front of the dishwasher like I had there before. But felt with all the buttons on the front this magnet made it look even busier and less slick.So looked at different options. Ordered this item. I have to open up the dishwasher to know whether it\u2019s clean or dirty but, it does what I needed to do and keep the front looking not so busy.Wished it was a slight bit bigger in size. What I don\u2019t know is how this will hold up overtime with the writing. But for now I\u2019m happy.",
