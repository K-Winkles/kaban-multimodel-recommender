                "reviewText": "I had purchased this Free & Clear dishwasher detergent several months ago and was very happy with it. It cleaned well and was exactly as it said: free and clear of all fragrances. I was almost out of my last box so I purchased another and was so disappointed when it arrived today. In spite of being in the same \u201cFree & Clear\u201d packaging, the detergent has a distinct smell to it (similar to other lemon-scented detergents).I am a super-taster which, unfortunately, is nowhere near as fun as it sounds. I am extremely sensitive to the taste of fragrances used in dish detergents. If there is any fragrance whatsoever in the products that clean my dishes, it\u2019s all that I can taste when I eat food off of them. It is difficult to find any detergents that are completely fragrance-free. I was so happy when I found Seventh Generation Free & Clear because it was affordable, effective, and my original box truly contained no fragrances. However, this most recent box is unusable in spite of claiming to be \u201c0% Fragrances.\u201d Very misleading. I am so disappointed.",

It works about as well as the Finish and Cascade powders it replaced. It leaves behind no smell at all (you'll either love it or hate it), doesn't sud, and works quite well in hard water. The Cascade powder I used leaves limescale on my stainless steel pots, this one doesn't.The packaging is a bit of a weak spot. The box isn't quite as sturdy as the ones Finish and Cascade come in. Not an issue, though, since it's good enough for most cases.",
