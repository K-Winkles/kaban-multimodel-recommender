We hooked up the dishwasher on 2/4/22 and ran it for the first time 2/5/22, 2/6/22 it gave a code of E4\u2026 we got on here and found the return window closed 1/31/22. My wife was very hesitant on getting this brand but I fell for the brilliant range. So I went with the set. I had not read the reviews, I just wanted to give Cosmo a shot. We do live cooking shows, I can\u2019t Imagine explaining to our 3 million viewers about the whole in our new cabinets.",
