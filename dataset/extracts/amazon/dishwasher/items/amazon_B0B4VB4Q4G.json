I like this better than the official Miele salt because theirs is in a box and this is in a resealable bag.However! If you only get the 5-pound version of this you will be sorry. The salt tank on your dishwasher holds most of a 5-pound bag on one fill. You'll get about three fills out of the 10-pound order, but one and a little more on the 5-pound order. Since the 10-pound order is less than double the price of the 5-pound, and it goes a LOT farther, it's worth buying large.",

I have had at least six previous dishwashers over the years, so I was surprised when I read my manual. I must say that so far it seems to have enhanced the cleaning. This particular product arrived quickly an appears to be doing its job.",
