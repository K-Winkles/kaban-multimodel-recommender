I've had this for less than a week but has met all my expectations. It's got a good seal, so air tight. It can hold up to 2 sticks of butter, so has plenty of room. It keeps the butter at just the right temp to easily cut a piece of spreadable butter. It's marked at proper sizes or servings. It's foot print on the counter is a bit larger, yet takes less room than a tub of butter or margarine. Until summer comes around again, I don't know how the butter texture will be. Too soft or again, just right. It even has a slot for the knife that comes with it. And, the only downside, is a downside, no matter what....it gets buttery and smudged as they all do but its contained inside and can certainly be washed. \ud83d\ude0aNow, the important part. It's on Amazon, shipped in 2 days, and only cost 15 dollars and change. Taxes and all. If you don't have Prime, there might be shipping but under 20 bucks is not bad.",

The little knife that comes with it stores under the cover perfectly and the clear cover lets you know if you need to put another stick in it. And, as mentioned, there is room for a second stick of butter to soften up before the first one is gone. It has a rubber seal and rubberized feet so it stays put on the counter. The top just sits on the rubber seal so you don't have to hold the dish down to open it. Just lift up on the cover.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this dish.The lid seals very well.It works best with the longer thin stick's of butter because you can fit two sticks side by side but we buy the shorter stubby sticks at Costco.I am not crazy about the knife design inside the dish, it tends to get butter on it easily.I ordered a second one but without the knife thinking I would have that extra space to fit a second stubby stick side by side but the style without the knife isn't the same size.It is more narrow, so I couldn't fit two sticks side by side.It would be great if they sold one that was wide enough to place two short sticks side by side and made the dish shorter because the length is much longer than needed.I ended up using the second dish I ordered for the longer unsalted butter sticks to keep them at room temperature for baking.Overall it is a very nice butter dish.Especially if you use the longer skinny sticks.Of the two designs, I prefer the one without the knife for household use.If you were using it for camping, I could see where the knife would be handy to have.Be careful not to drop the lids.We first bought another brand very similar and was planning to return it to purchase this one because it was wider.We decided to give that one to our parents instead but my husband dropped it as he was bringing it inside and the lid cracked pretty badly.\ud83d\ude1fThis style stays together better because of the seal.The design of the seal is wonderful.It has almost what I would call a suction close and open method.It would definitely keep any bug's out.",

                "reviewText": "I researched tons of butter dishes! This butter dish is perfect for all of these reasons listed: (a) can leave butter on counter to soften (b) butter knife sits in a slot inside the dish so it won't fall out, get lost or get debris on it. No searching for the knife. No running out of knives in the drawer. (c) has a very nice tight seal. You can pick it up by the lid but I would not recommend it just to be safe. There's no reason to. It has nice handles. (d) the butter knife has a substantial size handle. I can wrap 4 fingers around it in a fist and still see handle. The handle is 3.5inches and the blade is almost 2-3/4in. (e) Fits in fridge door butter keeper and can close door flap (f) has side ramps to wipe off the excess butter and rest the knife (g) has no-slip feet so the dish stays in place (h) Has TBSP marks and slight recess for the butter to stay in place. The knife blade fits exactly across the recess so you cut fully across butter side to side without angling the knife. THE RECESS WILL FIT A 2inch wide stick of butter! I use American size butter, east coast, which is 1.25in. wide. You can technically fit two sticks, but they come up over the recess slightly. Finally, for anyone with finger neuropathy, the knife handle won't get too cold in the fridge. Came in a sturdy box, no damage. I wish I could show a picture. ***I reviewed the Butterie brand but their knife sits on the outside and slides around. has no ramps to wipe off butter. and the Huveo brand looks nice but the knife sits on top in a loose recess, and much shorter handle plus you have to remove the inside to wash it. The KITCHENDAO is simple and exceeded my expectations. Video was helpful.",

From the sloped sides that assists you when getting your butter, to the wider width base, which allows for 2 sticks instead of just one, yet it still fits in the fridges butter tray compartment. It also has a great little knife with side slot to rest in, so it's always right there for you with a clear, sturdy lid that has a slight bit of suction (due to the base of the dish) that secures the lid nicely. No, this isn't fancy, but it does offer many nice features.. & I am quite happy with it. 1",
