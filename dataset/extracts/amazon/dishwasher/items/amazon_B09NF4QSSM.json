                "reviewText": "I use a different brand that has a weekly cleaning strength but when subscribe and save time came around it was out of stock so I wanted to try a substitute because if I miss a week, you can tell. :( Now, I already use Cascade tablets so I was a little skeptical if this would do much -- but I was shocked! It's not that the inside of my machine looks dirty, but there is a wet dog smell in the glasses if I don't clean it often enough (and yes, I do clean the filter too.) But, this tablet really cleaned the machine! I haven't used the weekly tabs in 2 weeks and there is still no smell. (For me, an empty rinse agent compartment can also impact a smell, so I keep that filled too. Sharing in case anyone else is trying to get of the smell on glasses.)",
