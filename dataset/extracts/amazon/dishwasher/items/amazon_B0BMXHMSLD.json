                "reviewText": "I have made way too many trips to the big box stores as I'm helping my son get his house back in order. Ordered this kit to do a brand new dishwasher install. At first, everything looked to be of good quality and even included instructions (which is rare for some of these bargains). I thought I was almost done with my install until I went to connect the water line under the dishwasher and realized there are NO threads on that end of line to connect to the elbow!! Now I'm going to have to make another trip to replace this line since this needs to be done tonight! So, to an earlier reviewer--yes, it IS possible to screw up a water hose connection!",
