The colors are vibrant and the pieces are a great size (we don\u2019t like huge plates) for adults and children. They came very quickly and are a great bargain. Also microwaveable and dishwasher safe.My husband\u2019s family have been wheat farmers for decades, so we were thrilled to see these great items are made with wheat straw! Great idea.",

We don't like heavy breakable dishes anyways, so this wasn't a big change for us. These have been awesome. Our bowls get the heaviest usage, and show the use with some light staining on a few of them. They're flexible, durable, and affordable. I will be buying more. I posted pictures to show the staining (bowls - from not stained to the most stained), and the scratches (plate). This doesn't bother us, or affect the function, and it's not like we bought wheat straw dishes to impress anyone \ud83d\ude05, so it's just not a big deal for us. It also took some time and lots of use for these stains and scratches to happen.",
