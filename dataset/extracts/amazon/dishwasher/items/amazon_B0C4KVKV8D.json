I use the dishwasher for sterilization purposes.I have used cascade packets in the past and they do a wonderful job.I am sorry these did not work as claimed. I want to support businesses that claim they are helping our planet by using their products but the product has to do the job it was claimed to do for me to continue its use.I am also upset with the return policy on this product as it only had less then a month window to return.To be fair the product needs at least 2 months.",
