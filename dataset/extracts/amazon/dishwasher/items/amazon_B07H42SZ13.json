So easy to use, just drop one of the tablets down on the bottom of your dishwasher once per week when you do a load of dishes. Smells great too and doesn't leave a film on glassware! There is even an easy calendar on the back so you remember to use. I would suggest to date the back of the date of the first use.",

                "reviewText": "Since I am elderly and a widow, I am no longer using the amount of dishes I used to. The dishwasher gets really stinky after awhile. The Finish Dishwasher Tabs make it easy to make the dishwasher smell like new! Just throw one pack under the rack and do your dishes as you normally do! Highly recommend this product!",

                "reviewText": "How do you measure the immeasurable? Examine the unseeable?It's like the commercial on TV for a cold remedy with a claim that the duration of your cold will be cut by 25% when you take the product. Huh? How in the world can I verify that claim?So, if I take it and the cold lingers for 3 days, that *should* mean that it would've lasted 4 days without it. How do I measure and quantify the duration of something that hasn't happened? You can't, just as I can't prove that I never visited Mississippi.It's my long-winded way of stating that I have to pretty much take it on faith---based on the manufacturer's reputation and the experiences of other users---that the cleaner does what it claims to do: cleans HIDDEN grease and grime.Do I know for certain that it's doing what it claims to do? No, because it's HIDDEN.Do I know for certain that it's NOT doing what it claims to do? No, because it's HIDDEN.To paraphrase Socrates, I know nothing except that I know nothing.So, I have to trust the manufacturer, Bosch, and the many users of this product who say that it does work, particularly since our new Bosch dishwasher is only a month old and has no visible mineral build-up or offensive odor that this cleaner can erase to demonstrate its worth.I'm using this cleaner as a preventative based on BOSCH's recommendation, like I do with dishwasher salt and rinse aid.It's better to stop a problem from developing than to correct it after it's happened, especially when it comes to mineral deposits, HIDDEN grease and grime, and foul odors.",
