                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Nice Compact Unit That Works as Advertised",
                "reviewText": "I've had my SPT dishwasher for more than a month now (I wanted to wait till I had a nice sampling of uses before leaving a review), and I can offer feedback that prospective buyers will perhaps find valuable.I had read quite a number of reviews here before purchasing my unit, and the smattering of complaints did give me pause. But here's what I've learned.Some reviewers said that their units arrived damaged. I'd imagine this is the fault of the delivery services, but, thankfully, mine came in perfect condition. Second, one or two reviewers complained that a hose leaked from the connection at the bottom back of the dishwasher. After having attached the hoses (which is part of the normal set-up), I can say with confidence that this is no doubt because the reviewers did not make sure they included the necessary washers when making the connections. In particular, one hose has its washer taped in place so it won't fall out of the connector, which it can do VERY easily. So it you're not careful when removing the tape, you can lose the washer and not realize it. The bottom line is that the connections are extremely simple; I cannot see any reason why there'd be leakage if the hoses are connected properly. And my unit is perfectly water-tight.Next, quite a number of reviewers mentioned that the dishwasher didn't dry the dishes well. I had the same experience INITIALLY, but then learned something: The detergent you use is of the utmost importance.I initially bought bargain, no-frills dishwasher detergent, and it appeared to work well, though the dishes didn't dry well, and on one occasion the detergent didn't wash off completely. I was concerned that maybe the unit wasn't really doing the job, but then a friend told me to try a certain high-end detergent pod (I won't mention its name because I don't want anyone to think my purpose is to advertise it).Wow, I was shocked at the difference. Not only did the detergent rinse away perfectly and leave the dishes and glasses crystal clear and shiny, but, to my surprise, they also dried wonderfully. The only exception are plastic containers (such as Chinese take-out ones); they don't dry well, but, then again, SPT says in the manual I believe that plastic won't dry well. The bottom line is that \u2014 and this apparently is true with all dishwashers \u2014 you must get a quality detergent.As for the unit in general, it rolls easily and is perfect for a small apartment such as mine; it fits in my tiny kitchen. The unit comes with a faucet adapter that fits on any standard faucet. It's easy to attach, and it provides much better water flow than my old faucet aerator. The hose adapter is easy to attach and detach from it, too.The dishwasher has a number of different settings and is easy to program. It does a very good job, and I'm happy to no longer have to do dishes manually. The unit's capacity is what you might expect from a smaller washer. I live alone and 24 hours' worth of dishes fit in the machine. So it's good for one or MAYBE two people, and that's what it's made for.Now I'll just have to see how long it lasts (you never know with products today). But so far, so great.",

                "reviewText": "I will update this review after longer periods of use.Today was my first day using this dishwasher and so far i am impressed. Unlike many other reviews my unit came flawless and ran without any issues. Hook up was easy, instructions were clear and here I sit not having to wash dishes by hand anymore. I have a spot for it to become a permanent fixture just need to get the kit to hard install.All in all I\u2019m very satisfied with this purchase. Would recommend if you\u2019re tight on space.Update: I purchased all the parts needed for a hard install. I did not know that some dishwashers (portable) can not be permanently installed. When I tapped the cold water line and ran the feed hose my dishwasher flooded. After taking everything apart and running the washer with parts that were included I got a E4 code. To clear this code I tilted the dishwasher slightly and got excess water out of the machine. There is a float sensor that will trip if the machine floods.As it sits now I\u2019m using the original hoses and may split the lines so I do not have to roll the machine to the sink.Still worth the money I paid. Take my misfortune and do not try and hard install. Be glad you have a dishwasher period.",

This cut my light bill by $28 I\u2019m very impressed. Very narrow design is perfect for crowded kitchens but you can wash quite a few dishes in a load.",

                "reviewText": "This machine appears to be used. It took a couple of weeks to get to me and didn't arrive until after I had a shoulder replacement. I was unable to do anything for weeks. I was finally able to get someone to unpackage it and bring it into the house. When the box came off, it was clear that it was either used or \"reconditioned\" or simply returned by someone and repackaged. There is a scratched area on the front upper right that was caused by some damage, and various dents and dings. There are a number of dents along the side and inside rear. It was already past the return date when it was finally unpacked. I have photos taken during the unpackaging. I have been unable to use it because I couldn't use my hand to hook it to the sink. It's been extremely frustrating. I finally got it hooked up today and the faucet connection leaks badly. The parts are all those that came in the box. It is all done correctly. It appears that the white \"handle\" hooked to the faucet does not seal whatsoever. Am having someone come over to see if another washer will fit in the connecter to stop the continuous flow of water from the connector.I am very disappointed with this entire deal. I paid over $500 for this machine as I have a tiny kitchen and nowhere to put one in a counter area. I wasn't able to use it until now. I had hoped it would arrive before my surgery, but it ended up being well past. I still can't lift or push anything, so it took until now to use it. I expected much better quality for that money and am not happy.I will never buy another appliance from a can opener to a dishwasher from your company, and probably not from Amazon. I won't take a chance.",
