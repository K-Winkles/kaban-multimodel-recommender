We\u2019re redefining clean for the 21st century. Clean products. Clean homes. Clean values. Leading by example and making sure we try to operate as transparently as a freshwater stream \u2013 without getting too holier-than-thou about it. All to inspire people to make their world that little bit cleaner. Pushing the envelope. Always asking if there\u2019s a cleaner way. Collaborating to create products that will make a real difference and change attitudes for the better. Sure, we\u2019ll make some mistakes along the way.

                "reviewText": "Overall, I'm pretty impressed with how it performs and its eco-friendly features.What caught my attention is that it's plant-based, making it a more environmentally friendly option compared to those loaded with harsh chemicals. Plus, it's free from artificial fragrances and dyes, making it suitable for folks with sensitive skin and allergies like me.In terms of cleaning power, it does the job quite well. Tackling everything from greasy pans to stained cups, the Ecover Zero leaves dishes spotless and shiny. No pesky residue or film left behind, which can be an issue with some detergents.The compact packaging is convenient for storage and handling. It's designed to work with all types of dishwashers.Now, it's worth mentioning that the Ecover Zero is a tad pricier compared to some other options out there. However, in my opinion, the investment is justified for the peace of mind and excellent results it delivers.Give it a shot if you're on the lookout for an eco-friendly and efficient dishwasher soap powder. The only downside I found is that each tablet is individually wrapped in plastic and can be a bit tricky to unwrap.",

I personally don\u2019t see what the plastic wrapper is an issue in some reviews. It comes out easily and I can see it is needed to keep the tablets from dissolving or breaking up in storage.

                "reviewText": "These clean well and the scent is fine. These are lovely BUT my husband forgets to unwrap them. The leading brand that we previously used had a dissolvable wrapper. So if he starts the dishes they get run without any soap. I find the tightly wrapped tablet at the bottom of the machine. I have to unwrap it and rerun the dishes. While the wrapper is labeled recyclable, my area doesn\u2019t support recycling for plastic film so it ends up in the trash. Basically these are a good product, poorly executed. I will switch to another product because in our home these result in wasted water and electricity as well as increased trash.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a product with that was affordable, cleaned well and does not have a toxic smell. This hit all 3. I paid a little more then I wanted but am pleased with the cleaning and also they seem less toxic then what I was using. I have yet however to look up toxicity levels of ingredients. They do have a small plastic bag around each one that has to be taken off. This is a little annoying when you are used to the dissolving bag and you would certainly want to prompt younger helpers to make sure to get it off. Likely the bag helps to preserve the pod though so IMO it is a fair trade.",

Thank you for this! \u2026.dishes come out crystal clean, not harming the environment. But mostly I LOVE LOVE LOVE the PRICE! At $5.99 for 25 pods. I mean this is astounding and amazing! Please keep that up you have a buyer for life here. At that price.Despite the fact i see here people whining about the individually wrapped tabs\u2026. I LOVE LOVE LOVE that they are INDIVIDUALLY wrapped .. so there is NO POWDER at the bottom of the box and each one is fresh. \u2026. Excellent and well done I say! Keep that up!If you are worried about the environment everyone should get off their ass and fight to stop the chemtrails being sprayed and the radiation bombardment on your smart meters and every technology that is emitting radiation instead of complaining about tiny super thin plastic wrapping of your dish detergent tabs sheesh ! Come on now people \u2026 really? There are far more dangerous and harmful things in the world we ALL should be working to stop \u2026 direct your energy to those things or we will not be here to enjoy our food and dishes right? \u2026 to your best health and to your Victory!
