So, I decided to order these and give them a whirl. I love the ease of just popping one pod into the washer and moving on.PRO:- The concentrated pods mean that 80 loads actually doesn't take up a ton of storage space- works just as well as the 'name brand' liquid stuff (see before/after photos. yes, the glass itself is banged up)- Eco friendly and affordable- Lemon scent vanished/didn't cling to dishesCON:- the fake lemon scent is pretty powerful. If you're sensitive to chemical smells or the like, this may not be for you.8/10 would recommend.",

There's a bit of a lemony scent, especially while the wash cycle is in progress, but there's no scent left on the plates or inside the dishwasher after the cycle is done. I always load my dishes without any pre-rinsing and haven't had any issues with this detergent scrubbing them clean, even after the plates sat for a day or two. I've washed plenty of glasses and haven't had any issues with water spots -- my glasses come out very clear! Very happy with these, would continue to use in the future.",

                "reviewText": "Pods are small size so should have no issue dispensing/fitting your dispenser. Lemon scent helps freshen the smell up. Note that many washers will leave some water pooling up and while this may help clean this, it's good to check that drain/filter every so often as well and get as much of that water out to see how it's looking in there. These pods left a light lemon scent after running, pricing per pod isn't too bad but a little higher than some. Bag they come in is resealable zip-lock style. Overall seems like a decent option.",

                "reviewText": "I've tried these twice. I followed instructions and only used one pod the first time. There were a few dishes that were still a bit dirty afterwards. The pods are really small in comparison to anything I've used previously. I tried two of the pods and it seemed to improve.However, if I had to use 2 pods per use at $22 a pack, I don't think that's a good use of my money. I'll finish out the pack, but won't repurchase. I'll update if I change my mind with more uses.",

                "reviewText": "The Clean Revolution Dishwasher Pods are working well in our dishwasher. I do prefer them to the name-brand pods because they are a little smaller and fit better into the pod case in the dishwasher. We do rinse our dishes before putting them into the dishwasher as we don't need to run it very often, so this may not be a fair test of the pods. I've used them about 6 times and have not found any residual food left on any dish, even when they weren't rinsed over the holidays with a houseful of family. I can't find any negatives about these pods and will continue to use them!",
