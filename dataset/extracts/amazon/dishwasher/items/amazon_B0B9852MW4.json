                "reviewText": "I like how well it snaps and does not leak. However, installing was not easy. You need a special device to heat up the tip of the hose and expand it. I ended up cutting the old hose and attaching it to the end of this one. Also, like many spare parts, the price does not make sense. A new dishwasher unit is about $600, and buying this for about $100 makes it about 16% of the price of a new unit. I wonder, if a hose is 15% of the price, what would be the price of an electric motor, and would there be anything left behind for all the other stuff in the unit?",
