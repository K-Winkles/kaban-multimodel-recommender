I am also very sensitive to fragrance so I don't like the liquid pods. The previous powder pods I bought before these were lousy, leaving all the dishes feeling like they weren't rinsed thoroughly enough and sometimes the dishes weren't even clean. So I was afraid to try more powder pods. But these work much better! Dishes are clean and don't need an extra rinse. Happy to have found a good solution. Less waste, no fragrance, works great!",

I think they were leaving a film on their plastic cups. I started using these and we have had no more problems! There isn't much of a strong smell and I feel so much more safe using them. I am in fact about to order more! I just reuse my old cascade tub and carefully place them into it. They clean just as good or better. I use my cascade tabs for my mop water now until they are gone. This product gave me peace of mind washing dishes and I won't ever go back to regular pods again. Thank you!",

                "reviewText": "I have used Finish Powerballs for years because they were top-rated by Consumer Reports, and they got our dishes and glasses cleaner than anything else. But recently, I have been switching all our cleaning products to less toxic varieties. This Clean People product is fabulous, though pricey. I will continue to use it for sure. The only thing I am not crazy about is the smell. They say it's lemon fresh, but the pods smells rather plastic-like to me right out of the bag. Fortunately, very little smell is left once the dishes are clean and dry.",
