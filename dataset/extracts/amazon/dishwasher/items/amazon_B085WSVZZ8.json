                "reviewText": "I have owned Corelle for years but my ex kept my old set. I just bought 24 place settings in five types to suit my needs. Winter Frost White is Cornell's \"Open Stock\" Dinnerware for Home or Business and accordingly offers the greatest variety of pieces and color matched accessories although some are porcelain, which is too bad. The \"Vitrelle\" glass is incredible. It's more durable and chip resistant than one would believe and its easy to clean! It doesn't get hot in a microwave and because it's glass it doesn't conduct heat well. So, the edges are safe to touch/pick up, even if the food is boiling hot! If you think White looks to plain, there are options just in sets that are limited to a few choices of bowls, plates etc. You will find White looks classy in any setting! For example: You can't get \"Versa Bowls\" in any of the patterns I have seen. Winter Frost White also has Divided plates in 8\u201d and 10.25\u201d great for kids or Parties. That\u2019s next on my shopping list.",
