                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Just-right, small-sized car freezer",
                "reviewText": "I have owned and reviewed over a handful of car freezers, including Foho/Costway, Acopower, and Rockpals. Each had their pros and cons. This Joy Pebble looks to be the right size for day trips.PROS- Lightweight and \"just the right size\" for grocery shopping (my wife's own words)- One compartment for use as either freezer or fridge- Fast freezing-- After 30 minutes, compartment went from 78F to 45F-- After 60 minutes, it went down to 9F- Temperature was roughly consistent during 1 day of continuous testing. It was set at -4F, and spot checking throughout the day resulted in between -4F and 0F- Auto resume: When power supply is cut off and later restored, appliance continues operation- Two (2) Power options-- 12V car adapter (draws about 38W or 3.3A on 12V)-- 100-240V AC wall plug- Low energy usage. (See TIPS section for calculating how long the car freezer could be used for on a battery power station)-- Freezer only uses power to reach or maintain set temperature. Once there, it goes idle-- 50W with AC port of the Goal Zero Yeti 500X (8W of that is used by Yeti's inverter)-- 38W with 12V DC car port on the Goal Zero-- 0W \u2013 2W on idle- Usable during off-roading-- Works at up to 30 degree angle tilt-- Anti-shake design keeps compressor protected- Can be used while the car is turned off, if its car port has a bypass to work directly off the battery-- Many SUVs, trucks, and minivans today have such output at the back. Refer to the car's owner manualCONS- Like other car freezers in this price range, requires manual defrosting-- To defrost and remove excess ice, power off the unit and wipe dry, then power back on--- Do not allow a large amount of frost to build up on the inside of the walls as that will make cooling less efficient-- I was not immediately able to find any portable car freezers that have an automatic, self-defrost cycle that \"cleans\" the freezer from accumulating too much frost- No protective carry bag included- Not waterproof. Keep it out of the rainTIPS- When you receive your car freezer, do NOT plug it in until it has stood upright for at least 10 hours to allow the refrigerant to settle- Internal temperature is displayed on the LCD at power-on and updates periodically- Power off/on by holding the \"POWER\" button for a few seconds- There is no built-in battery-- Requires a power station, 12V/24V DC/car port, 120V/220V AC, or solar panel(s) capable of providing at least 60W of sustained powerRUNTIME WITH BATTERY POWER STATIONS- To calculate how long the car freezer could be used for with a battery power station depends on the battery's capacity (Wh) and how much power (W) the car freezer draws- Examples are with a Jackery Explorer 1000 (1002 Wh). Halve the time when used with a Goal Zero Yeti 500x (500Wh)-- Plugged into AC port: 1002 Wh x 0.85 / Device Wattage--- As short as 16.3 hours (1002 Wh x 0.85 / 52W). Longer when idle---- Informal testing found an estimated use of 500-670 Wh/day as a fridge. It was idle much of the time--- About 10-15% of power is lost during conversion from DC (battery) to AC, which is normal for all power stations-- Plugged into DC port: 1002 Wh / Device Wattage--- As short as 25 hours (1002 Wh / 40W). Longer when idleCOOLING EFFICIENCY- Car freezer only uses power to reach or maintain the set temperature. Once there, it goes idle-- Time can be shorter or much longer, depending on how often the car freezer's compressor needs to be activated to reach or maintain target temperature- The colder the set temperature and/or the warmer the ambient (surrounding) heat, the more energy will be used-- Keep in a cool location and out of direct sunlight for best efficiency-- Consider putting the car freezer in an insulated bag for better cooling- Ensure adequate air flow (4\"+) on all sides of the car freezer, especially where the fan is at- The more frozen/cold items are inside, the longer they can stay cool/frozen. Avoid opening the lid too often or for too longMAINTENANCE- Ensure lid seal is clean and unobstructed to keep cold air from escaping- Clean inside with a damp cloth every week-- Use sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) dissolved in lukewarm water to clean anything dirty-- Allow inside to dry before closing lid and putting away- Do not use detergent, soap, or abrasive/sharp products- Never clean under running water- Do NOT store the unit on its side. Always keep it upright to prevent damage to the compressorCONCLUSIONThe Joy Pebble 19qt car freezer cools FAST and is just the right size for day trips and grocery shopping.",

                "reviewText": "What a great price! What more could you ask for in a dishwasher. I just got it today and used it Arrived and packaged well. Theres a water tank on this and you open up this little drawer and add the water. You don't fill it up on the top It's great. I'm filling it with my bidet sprayer that I use for my portable washing machine. I think that this is an introductory price 184.00 I imagine the price is gonna go up. I would grab it now while it's listed low on the websiteUpdated review: I've only had this dishwasher for a few days When I first got it it had some kinks in it and I thought I had gotten it straightened out. It does not go into the draining cycle. I'm returning it back to Amazon I paid $184.00 I would have to spend an extra hundred dollars to go with a different brand that saying don't let one bad apple spoil the bunch I decided to go with a replacement. I will keep my review updated.Updated reviewReplacement arrived, and it is workingThe merchant is standing by their product. They have been communicating with me back-and-forth to meet my expectations and be satisfied with their product. They have made it so that I can purchase a five-year protection plan on this dishwasher At this point I am pleased with my purchase. customer service has been great. Replacement is doing the same thing. It is not going into the last cycle This is my second time using the dishwasher. I reached out to the company and told them that I was returning and I'm not interested in their product.",

Kind courteous and quick responses would definitely recommend this seller.1st i have to cut a 1/2 inch off my cabinet to get it to fit next to my sink, i did not want to do the direct water source as i have to many things hooked up to my sink lines already so i got the 1.9 gal tank HOWEVER, on EVERY cycle even the 30 min rapid mode it will stop half way through and i would need to add more water to the tank or it will not finish. so i can never start it and not be home to wait for the cycle to tell me to add more water.2nd i love that i can turn the drying on/off for all cycles3rd the rack sucks for washing lids of plastic containers as they fall through the rack and stop the lower arm from spinning AND the silverware basket by default is in the front and blocks the view of the window. i bent 1 or 2 prongs and put it in the back and that seems to work fine.4th i love the cycles and how strong the washing is from the upper and lower arms.",
