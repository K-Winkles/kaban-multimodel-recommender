However, none of the size were exact fit for the GE machine. I had to cut it down to the lowest size and then use some brutal man power to push it in there. After that everything was smooth sailing, great quality hose and the best thing is.... It arrived in 14 hours. I ordered it at 8 PM, it was by my door at 10 AM next morning. Recommended.",

The only issue I had was that this hose has square accordion ridges while the original Samsung uses rounded ones. This was only an issue when fitting into the plastic clasp inside the dishwasher. I solved this by simply using a piece of 12 gauge copper wire to twist-tie it into place. BTW, my local appliance parts store quoted me $90 for this part!",
