It closes very tight.I actually returned the dish because it closes too tight and it was too hard for my kids to open the dish. I forsaw butter flying off the dish as they struggled to open it. I am glad I had they try it before using the dish. But if you are trying to keep little kids or paws off the butter, this would be a good dish for you.",
