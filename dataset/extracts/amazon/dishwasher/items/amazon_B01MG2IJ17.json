                "reviewText": "Just moved into a rental with an old whirlpool dishwasher and I didn't want to spend too much on detergent. Came across this Mrs. Meyers product for a doable price and decent reviews. These pods work well - everything comes out squeaky clean and leaves behind a hint of lemon scent. There is also a slight white residue that pops up some our plastic dishes that comes off after a second rinse in the sink.Highly recommend these if you're budgeting and don't want too many chemicals on your dishes.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to use a more environmentally friendly dishwashing detergent and tried a few different brands. I wasn't pleased with some so when I found Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day on Amazon.com, I thought I would try it. Before this, I was already in love with Mrs. Meyer's Basil Hand Soap so I knew I would like the scent. These dishwashing \"packs\" are little packaged pillows containing just the right amount of detergent for a normal sized dishwasher. The plastic coating degrades during the first phase of the wash cycle. The end result? My dishes come out clean, everytime! And smelling nice too! The Basil scent is not strong at all and not an overpowering basil smell - it's more of a clean, lightly herbal smell and very refreshing. The scent does not linger on the dishes - you really can only smell it when the dishwasher is running, and it's kinda like aromatheropy for the kitchen! As for the cleaning power, these do a great job on everyday dirty dishes although I usually rinse off most dishes if I know I am not going to run the dishwasher that day. It does a great job with all my coffee mugs and oils on dishes from salad dressings and sauces.What I really like about this product is that the company that makes them is environmentally responsible using only ingredients that are safe for the earth as well as people and animals.From Mrsmeyers.com website for this product:\"PRODUCT INGREDIENTS ARE AT LEAST 97% NATURALLY DERIVED.INGREDIENTS: Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Carbonate, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Carbonate Peroxide, Sodium Silicate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Hydrated Silica, Linear Alcohol Ethoxylate, Ocimum Basilicum (Basil) Oil, Carum Petroselinum (Parsley) Seed Oil, Piper Nigrum (Black Pepper) Seed Oil, Protease, Amylase, Fragrance\"Best of all, Amazon.com sells these dishwashing packs at almost $2.00 less per pack than suggested retail price if you purchase them with their Subscribe and Save program. Manufactured price is $7.99 ea - buying them through Amazon you get 6 packs (normally $43.14 which breaks down to $7.19 each) for $36.67, so it breaks down to $6.11 each! That's a great savings! Plus, for something you know you will need every month, it's good to have them on hand for when you run out, but you can also have them automatically shipped at regular intervals without doing anything! Perfect for the busy family! I highly recommend this product!",

                "reviewText": "I have been really happy with most Mrs. Meyer's products I have tried, so I decided to try these dishwasher tabs. They have a mild fresh scent before using them, but I do not smell it while the dishwasher is running or after the cycle has finished. That is fine, though, as the objective is to clean dishes and utensils, which these tabs do well. I have used other brand name tabs for years, and these work just as well. I like that they are white, too. Makes it nicer to look at if they are left out as decor in a bowl or jar. (If you have children or pets, of course, do not leave them where they can get to them and possibly eat them.) I recommend these and will buy them again.",
