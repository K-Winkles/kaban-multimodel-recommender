In years past, I've always used more expensive brands, but with my current budget, decided to give these a try. They work very well and while there is a scent, it's not terribly unpleasant or pungent. They clean dishes and utensils very well. I've noticed no film or scent present in my old dishwasher after I've run the cleaning cycle. Considering the results and price, I'll be buying this dish washing detergent again.",

I like the tabs that has 3 different cleaning sections in one pod. The actual dishwasher smells fresher after the wash cycle. I'm not sure of this is an added bonus, but I was able to tell a difference. They stay fresh in the pod packs. I don't have to open anything, just pop them in the washer and turn it on. The dishes shine and are squeaky clean including the glasses and flatware. I won't use anything else.",

Wish it came in a tub instead of plastic pouch though. Glad I kept the tub. Seems to do a good job with dishes but I always scrub the food off with a brush prior to putting them in the dishwasher rack\u2026 I just don\u2019t like the idea of putting plates in with food caked everywhere. In my opinion, these are great for my style.",
