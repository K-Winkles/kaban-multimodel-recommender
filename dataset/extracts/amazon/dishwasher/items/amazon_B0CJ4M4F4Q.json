The center cover hinge and clip is a little weak but I do not intend to ever use it so it does not matter to me. I have it stored away. The end covers are well designed and made and are the ones that I will place small items in. If you want a laugh read the instructions on the box. They state that to install the basket you must disconnect power from the dishwasher. Come on now! Where is the electrocution risk?",
