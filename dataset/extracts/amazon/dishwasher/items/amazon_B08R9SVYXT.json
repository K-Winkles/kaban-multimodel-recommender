                "reviewText": "My old element burnt out so I ordered this one. I thought it was junk as the dishwasher would not clean and it never seemed to be heating water. Today I was searching for a oem element to replace it and stumbled on a post of someone saying you need to reset the dishwasher after install. Turns out dishwashers throw codes like cars and have a full diagnostic mode, after reset this element is working perfect. Search whirlpool dishwasher reset and follow instructions, it's an easy process and necessary for the element to work.",
