                "reviewText": "I have a circa 2007 LG5815WW/1 that does not use the extra black vent hose. The old hose I removed was 12' long and this one appears to be a bit shorter, maybe 10'. For me, that's not a big deal, especially if your dishwasher is right next to the sink. But if I had it to do over again, I would have just purchased the LG 12' drain hose that would have replaced exactly what I removed (no extra black hose to begin with).The installation went pretty smoothly, but the way that the hoses are glued into the \"U\" shaped tube is off so that when you connect the hose to the bottom port on the dishwasher, the \"U\" hung sideways rather than flush with the side of the unit. I was able to use zip ties to help, but it was the dishwasher side panel that is forcing it to be flush.The other thing is the extra black hose... I could have purchased a new 4975DD1001A Dishwasher Guide Assembly (1267810 AH3524749 EA3524749 PS3524749) that accepts the black hose (mine is really gunked up from the looks of it) but I figured why spend another $108 on a 16yr. old dishwasher... Some have said to plug it up with epoxy. For me, I bought a \u00bd\" black plastic pex 'plug' at Home Cheapo and used that to plug it up. Worked tight, but really well. Since the black hose is at the top of the unit, I doubt it's going to get much water anyway.Lastly, I plan to put a water sensor under my unit (Simplisafe detector in my case) as the hose started leaking and it wasn't until drywall damage to the downstairs ceiling did we realized what was going on. Then again, it took almost 10 years in the present location for the hole to develop.",
