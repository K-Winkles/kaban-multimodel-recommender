I am delighted to share my experience with the KITCHENDAO Airtight Butter Dish, and I must say, it has elevated my butter storage game to a whole new level. This product truly deserves a solid five-star rating.The large capacity of this butter dish is a standout feature, accommodating Eastern, Western, European style, and even Kerrygold butter.

It not only keeps the butter fresh but also protects it from unwanted elements like dust, bugs, and even curious cats. Having soft, ready-to-spread butter on the countertop is now a constant pleasure.The design considerations are impressive. The side ramps make it easy to scoop up butter while providing a convenient place to rest the knife. The curved ramps at both ends facilitate effortless butter retrieval, and the top of the ramp doubles as a scraper to ensure no butter goes to waste.Measurement marks and an anti-slip bottom add to the functionality. The TBSP marks and slight recess keep the butter in place, aiding in portion control. The anti-slip bottom ensures stability during butter cutting, making the entire experience hassle-free.Dishwasher safe is the icing on the cake \u2013 cleaning is a breeze, adding to the convenience of this butter container.To top it off, KITCHENDAO's commitment to hassle-free customer service is commendable.
