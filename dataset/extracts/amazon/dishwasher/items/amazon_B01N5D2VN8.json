Which means that my three-year old dishwasher had NEVER been cleaned and it uses very hard water. Needless to say, it was full of mineral deposits and stains and was looking old before its time. Not to worry! A single cleaning with the Cascade, and my dishwasher was shiny clean again . . .almost. One or two small stains remained, but the difference was amazing. I am hoping a second cleaning will get those few stains off and I will turn over a new leaf and clean it more than every three years. Seriously, it works well. Try it.",
