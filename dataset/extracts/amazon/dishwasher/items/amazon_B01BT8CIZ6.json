Great value for the money because I purchased a two pack. I am now set for the year! I will continue to purchase this product as long as I own my Miele dishwasher.",

Well, this easy little step saved me a few hundred dollars because I now use one every 3 months and my dishwasher is working perfectly---never had to pay for a service call and I really appreciate the Miele tech helping me troubleshoot and giving me this option rather than a pricey service call. Seems to keep the machine clean and make sure residual grease is not circulating and being deposited back onto the dishes.",
