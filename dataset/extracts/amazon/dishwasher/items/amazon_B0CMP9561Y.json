I don't expect any of these will fall off or split.The one drawback I can think of is that they are a bit thicker. There may be some dishes, or more likely glasses, that fit in just right now. Adding these caps might reduce the space enough where those items might not fit in.",

                "reviewText": "I just bought a brand new dishwasher. While reading reviews of the dishwasher, and other dishwashers too, I noticed some complaints that the tine tips were rusting. When I saw these, I just knew I had to get it for prevention!I still have the white bottom rack from my 16 yr. old Whirlpool. I am actually still using that rack in the new dishwasher because it is so dark in there with everything being a very dark gray..... So the tines on the old rack are actually thinner than the tines on the brand new rack? What? They are making things better/stronger now? Yeah, I guess they are. These covers fit both racks from my old Whirlpool and the new Frigidaire, but on the new thicker Frigidaire tines, you have to twist/turn/push at the same time while putting them on. They WON'T just fly off the tines during a wash cycle. While they are much easier to put on the tines of the old Whirlpool rack, they still don't come off in the wash cycle.These also serve as a bit of another layer of protection from things bumping around too. These are a clear/white color. If your dishwasher is anything like mine, completely dark inside, this makes it a bit easier to see things. Love that there are so many, definitely enough to do the bottom rack of a dishwasher. Both of the bottom racks I have are 72 tines each. My top rack has 53 spots where I would use these so I am ordering another pack, now. Price? Excellent. If you are someone who might complain about a few rusty tines on a new washer (tine rust is NOT covered under a warranty) then this $7 pack of 100 silicone tine tips is for YOU! I really love this idea for prevention! This should be sold in every appliance stores everywhere. But, at least we know we can get it here on Amazon.",
