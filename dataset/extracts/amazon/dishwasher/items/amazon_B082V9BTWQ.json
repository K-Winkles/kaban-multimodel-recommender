                "reviewText": "Our new Bosch dishwasher came with a sample of the same Quantum Finish pods to use and a label said these worked best for our brand and model.We used up the samples, purchaser another small bag of them and at some point, we ended up buying another popular brand to try when we ran out an needed some at our local grocery store.The alternate brand worked poorly. Even though we rinse off plates, etc before putting them in the dishwasher, we found the other brand did not clean as well, especially on some items that had a thin layer of oil/grease on them like steak knifes and especially a grill rack we use in our toaster oven.We use Finish non-spotting additive, but, the other brand just wasn't up to the task of getting everything \"squeaky clean\".So after using the off brand tub with its 115+ pods (we should have purchased a much smaller quantity), we went back to the good 'ol Quantum we got at Amazon and wow, our new Dishwasher was back cleaning everything completely, with no spotting or slight bits of food stuck and dried on plates.Lesson learned. The Quantum finish tabs are in fact smaller then the other brand we have, have a fresher and less intense aroma and most importantly, clean so very thoroughly.If you have an older or a new dishwasher that does not seem to be cleaning that well and you have confirmed water temp is hot enough and no mechanical issues for the Washer, try using the Quantum for a month and I'm betting you will see a very noticeable improvement in cleaning as soon as you switch over to this brand.I've read that many appliance/dishwasher manufacturers design their cleaning system in it based on a certan brand of Dishwasher Detergent and if this is true, that's clearly why Bosch recommended these Quantum Powerballs as the only one to use in their dishwashers.5 Stars and we're never going to use any other brand or type again. I highly recommend you give these a try if you are dissatisfied with your dishwasher and how it is performing.",

                "reviewText": "These dish pacs work great! I have always loved Finish Quantum pacs, and these are no exception! They do a great job of removing nearly everything from the dishes, especially when used on tougher loads! My dishware is always sparkling, as is the silverware! The machines themselves are also cleaner for longer as well.Now, I had to remove a star for two reasons: 1) The price difference, and 2) The scentThe price is not bad, still cheaper than cascade and work just as well, if not better. But, I am not completely sold when compared to the normal Quantum pacs. The normal Quantum pacs are great and work fine for nearly any and every load. These newer pacs are no different, but not noticeably better to me. Now, unless you run a very heavy, dirty, greasy load, then they show their extra power. If that's what you need than they are a bargain I'm sure, but for most normal loads they are just overkill. Of which brings me to me to my second point...The scent. The scent is not bad, and again, for really dirty, stinky loads I'm sure they are grate. However I think its a little too strong. I use both a normal full size dishwasher and a small countertop dishwasher and use the same detergent in each. Now, in the smaller dishwasher I noticed that these are simply overkill all the way around, not bad at all, just overkill. They tend to leave the scent behind very strongly, to the point that my dishes started tasting like soap, even after the wash and two rinses. With the large machine I did not notice anything tasting like soap, but the scent lingers and often I would notice that using a cup for just plain water I could still smell the scent.I will note that for both machines this is exaggerated when utilizing the shorter cycles, and is less of an issues with longer cycles. I would also like to note that both of my machines have plastic interiors, meaning they are more susceptible to scents than stainless machines.Overall I do like these and will definitely buy more and keep them on hand! I just thing I will utilize them for my heavier loads rather than my normal daily ones.",
