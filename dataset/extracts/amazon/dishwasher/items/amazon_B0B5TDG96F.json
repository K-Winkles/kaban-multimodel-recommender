                "reviewText": "Very pleased with this purchase. I recently moved to an apartment without a dishwasher. Hating washing dishes my whole life, I bought my previous countertop dishwasher, which unfortunately started to leak after a few uses, and thus I had to switch to a tank-filled version. This one is indeed much smaller and trying to fit all dishes often takes some effort (especially large plates with thick rim and deep bowls), but virtually all water tank dishwashers are like this, and I just use it daily. It\u2019s actually less annoying than those that require a tap connection, since I still have access to my kitchen sink while this dishwasher is running. It also cleans very well, and the operation is pretty simple and straightforward.One thing I particularly like about this cutie is the height. If you also have your kitchen cabinets hanging low and are worried about fitting a dishwasher on the table, remember to measure the space you have and check the height of the product. And probably look no further. Dishwasher models with water tanks are usually tall, and this one is the shortest I could find on Amazon, which fits on my counter so PERFECT (see picture).Also liked the light and the cup tray, which actually holds large utensils that are too tall for the utensil basket pretty well bc the spikes that keep stuff in place. My only complaints are that the wheels on the rack often go off track when pulled out, and that water sometimes spills out when filling the tank. Great product overall.",

                "reviewText": "Well designed and functional. I'm not allowed to make modifications to my HUD apartment so this solved that problem with the attached drain in the sink and pouring 1 1/4 gallons of water any temperature into the top. When needed the water is heated internally to boiling. Note: Cups with indented bottoms need to be set on their sides or they will not dry. In addition to the pre-set wash cycle times, drying time is one hour. I've used the 30 minute \"quick wash\" every time so far and everything is clean. Drop a powder pod into the bottom or fill the indented area in the lid. There is no assembly. Clamp on hose and go. The drain is not high intensity so no splashes and works with slow drains. When left plugged in a VERY LOW speed silent fan will continue to dry the unit with the door shut. A typical full load is cooking and dining ware for two people. It's lighter than a 1100W microwave and I have it on a roll around cart to increase my tight counter space. Tank fill pitcher and vegi-fruit cleaning bowl included. It makes no more or maybe even less noise than a microwave. I have a sensitive cat who is not bothered by it. At most uses 7.92 amps so plenty of power room left on a 20 amp circuit for other appliances. Everything needing cleaning inside is easy and detachable. Only minor complaint is the water full alarm is VERY soft so those hard of hearing will have to keep an eye on the add water display to see it go out.",

I find myself in immediate pain after washing one or two plates, so my kitchen was frequently messy and now that I have this little wonder of a portable dishwasher hooked right up to the sink. My kitchen is spotless all the time. There's never any dishes in the sink. When the dishwasher is done I put the dishes away and then put my dirty dishes in there as I go and then just wash them. It doesn't take long and it does a fantastic job. If there's anybody out there that lives alone and hates to do dishes, this item is for you. It's quiet, it is easy to use and it gets the job done. I have also used the fruit and vegetable washing feature. That is really cool as well. Gets everything nice and clean removes any wax they put on at the store and bam you're ready to go. If I could give this 12 stars I would",

However, I had some company over throughout the holidays, as well as during this first week of 2024! I\u2019m disabled and it\u2019s hard for me to stand to do dishes, or anything for that matter, for long periods of time. I did have to rinse a couple of items as you can\u2019t expect utter miracles with older stuck on food! Anyway, it works spectacularly! My dishes have been coming out really clean. I did about 3 sets of dishes the first day! The only thing is, is that I can\u2019t seem to be able to start the 73 hours of clean air, that you can use to help keep the inside dry when not using it. I tried to use it yesterday, and my intent is/was to be able to leave it on all night in the future. It only worked for about an hour, and after doing it twice, it still wasn\u2019t totally water free. The instructions on this particular feature, are not exactly easy to understand or follow. It isn\u2019t featured very prominently, almost as an afterthought. Maybe the seller should pay a little more attention to this feature, as I think it\u2019s just as important as using the machine for it\u2019s intended purpose. It\u2019s just as important to keep the machine clean as it is to have it clean your dishes. No clean machine, not that great clean dishes, no?! That\u2019s the only thing that I can think of, so far, as a negative, and that\u2019s saying a lot! Thank you ChuMaste for making my life so much easier!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this as a Christmas gift for my little Househusband, and to say he was thrilled would be an understatement!My Husband, bless his heart, really hates doing the dishes. Cooking, cleaning the toilet, fetching my slippers when I come home from a long, hard day at the office - he could do those sort of things all day and never tire of them. But dishes? Well, let's just say there's a lot of \"soaking\" happening in our kitchen!That's why I really wanted to treat him this Holiday season - he always has dinner ready and on the table when I get home at 5:30pm and spends a lot of time making sure he looks handsome for me (coming home to a handsome, clean, well put together man is a must for hardworking women like me). So I spent 10 minutes thinking of what to get him for Christmas before it came to me; a dishwasher!Now you should know that this dishwasher comes in a box that reveals EXACTLY what's inside, so keep that in mind if it's a gift. The deliverywoman left the box outside of our apartment door and my Husband saw it and just could NOT wait until Christmas day to use it, so I chuckled and allowed him to open the box and place the dishwasher on our kitchen counter. His eyes sparkled with unshed, joyful tears. He was almost as happy as that year I got him a new toilet scrub brush for his birthday!Now, we all know being a Househusband isn't hard work, am I right ladies? I mean, he probably spends half the day sitting on his cute little toosh, eating bon bons and reading men's magazines (I'm not actually sure what he does)!But what DOES work hard is this dishwasher. My Husband has used it over and over again since he received it last week and it has done the job beautifully every time. The dishes are always clean when he takes them out, the water is easy to replenish (my Husband fills the machine with the included pitcher and it plays a delightful little tune when there's enough water) and being able to see through the front door and watch the water slosh around has kept my Husband entertained for HOURS! No more listening to him ramble on about Ryan Reynolds or the latest graphics card or whatever his cute little brain is preoccupied with that week!I couldn't be happier with our new little kitchen helper, and it's certainly given my Househusband more time to attend to my needs.So if you're a hard-working woman with a little fella at home who just HATES getting his hands wrinkly in dishwater like mine, this is the perfect gift! Now if I could only just get him to stop talking so much!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Nos lleg\u00f3 la m\u00e1quina pero cuando la abrimos estaba mojada, creemos que no era nueva, se nos hizo raro, despu\u00e9s la parte de la pantalla ten\u00eda una etiqueta que dec\u00eda \"remover\" nos dimos cuenta que solo era esa esquina de la etiqueta, porque el pl\u00e1stico real de la pantalla ya hab\u00eda sido removido y los rayones que tenia no est\u00e1ban sobre alg\u00fan pl\u00e1stico, estaban sobre la pantalla.Otro de los pl\u00e1sticos laterales de protecci\u00f3n tambien ven\u00eda roto... Decidimos prenderla para ver si funcionaba, y en efecto si funcionaba, pero tenia 3 problemas:1) Como claramente era usada, y no sab\u00edamos por cuanto tiempo lo hab\u00eda sido (cuando viene con rayones importantes, dejo foto) era no tener la garant\u00eda de un producto nuevo.2) Al poner el ciclo de lavado metimos algunos platos y cubiertos, solo se lavaron bien los trastes que realmente estaban casi limpios, los que llegaban a tener algo salsa se quedaron manchados de salsa, sobre todo en cubiertos.3) Todos los ciclos de lavado incluyen 60min de secado por calor y esto no se puede detener o controlar, m\u00e1s el ciclo normal de lavado de m\u00e1s de una hora, son m\u00e1s de 2 horas para lavar platos que no est\u00e1n realmente sucios (porque recordemos que los que tiene salsa pegada los debes lavar a mano, eso dice el manual)En general no es un mal electrodom\u00e9stico, pero esta muuuy limitado en capacidades y limpieza, esto sumado a que llego mojado... Lo regresamos al siguiente d\u00eda.",
