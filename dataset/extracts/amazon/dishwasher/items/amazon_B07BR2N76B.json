                "reviewText": "I just LOVE this countertop dishwasher I have been looking at for months and finally took the plunge and bought it. I wish I did earlier. I hate washing dishes by hand. Did I mention I HATE washing dishes? Dishes are the bane of my life and scrubbing them daily is a depressing existence after almost 60 years of doing so, for myself and everybody else. I don\u2019t mind rinsing them clean before putting in a dishwasher which I have always done, because yuck, its a dishwasher,, not a food washer and easy to do as soon as you bring the dish or cup to the sink. I was looking for a small portable dishwasher to replace the full sized portable rolling one someone gave me when they moved out of their house, that I gladly accepted. It only lasted a year before it broke. I didn\u2019t even know countertop dishwashers were in existence till I looked for a portable replacement.This washer holds a LOT more than I thought it would. In there, are 6 dinner type plates, 1 smaller plate, 11 cups, glasses and mugs, 2bowls, 5 small jars/small bowls, and a bunch of silverware which all came out super clean and non water spotted. I use Cascade gel and Finish jet dry rinse aid on the P2 setting which will be the setting I will probably use the most. It was easy to install the hoses which do not leak and the adaptor fit with my regular sink tap perfectly. It looks beautiful too. The real test was how well did it clean the dishes. It passed that test with better than flying colors! Also it is quiet as a mouse, except of course for the gush of water that comes out when its disposing the water into the sink.If you have been looking at this item, like I did for months, torn on whether or not to treat yourself to a life enhancing joyful purchase, don\u2019t wait any longer. I read all the reviews and this was the one I went for... also because it was less than 18 inches high which was what my countertop space required, for fitting between counter and upper cabinets.",

                "reviewText": "I moved into a basement studio, but I refused to give up on having a dishwasher. Space is at a premium down here, so size was an important factor, but it also had to be able be plumbed under the sink because I don't have a counter it could fit on.There are plenty of reviews talking about the pros and cons of the dishwasher, so I'll cover that quickly. It works as well as most dishwashers I've owned. I put in a newly baked chunky cauliflower mash, and it cleaned right off. Last night's macaroni and cheese did not. In other words, get the big stuff off, and if it's left out over night, give it a soak before you put it in. It's like any other dishwasher, which is exactly what I hoped for! I also have to mention that I'm impressed with what I can fit in there considering the size. Full size plates and bowls, pots and pans, etc. Lastly, the 45 min clean cycle is really all you need. It does the job, and it's legit only 45 minutes.Onto the plumbing, since I'm sure I'm not the only one here who was looking for that info. I'll tell you upfront, it was a colossal pain in the rear to find the parts. I probably spent about 4 total hours and $45 buying and exchanging parts. The main problem is your main water line fittings are compression, but the dishwasher hookups on the backside are plain brass fittings. They don't match. So I had to find a way around it....and I did.***NOTE**** I'm not a professional plumber. Consult one if you want to hook your dishwasher to the main lines since it was NOT designed for this and I'm not qualified to give advice!!!!Here are the connectors I had to buy to make this work:https://www.amazon.com/Whirlpool-W10685193-Dishwasher-Gooseneck-Fitting/dp/B00NMLG2EM/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=dishwasher+adapter+hose&qid=1560513435&s=gateway&sr=8-3https://www.amazon.com/Melnor-290KF-Kink-Free-Hose-Saver/dp/B002HWKQOE/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=6+inch+garden+hose&qid=1560513496&s=gateway&sr=8-4https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FH9OB4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005792KTS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1https://www.amazon.com/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=pa_sp_atf_aps_sr_pg1_1?ie=UTF8&adId=A04167111ELQIWYKA625F&url=%2FConnector-Connecting-Dishwasher-Essential-Values%2Fdp%2FB078TM1TXL%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1_sspa%3Fkeywords%3Ddishwasher%2Badapter%2Bhose%26qid%3D1560513435%26s%3Dgateway%26sr%3D8-1-spons%26psc%3D1&qualifier=1560513435&id=615322050740664&widgetName=sp_atfYou'll notice that one piece is missing from this assembly, and I bought it at a local big box store. I recommend you assemble all these pieces, and bring it to a plumbing shop or big box store. You'll immediately see which piece you need. Be sure to use plumbers tape between fittings so it doesn't leak!After you get all your fittings assembled, connect it to the the faucet adapter assembly that came with the dishwasher.. The other end of that water line goes on the dishwasher. Make sure you read the directions and put it on the right one. I screwed that up and got an E1 error, which indicated that the dishwasher wasn't getting water (duh!!!). The drain hose will attach to the dishwasher on one end, and you'll need to cut the nut off the other end so you can fix it to the sink drain. The sink drain should have an input for dishwasher drainage. Simply put the hose in the drain hose connector (aka branch connector in one of my links above) and tighten the o-rings.I hope this helps!Two things to keep in mind:1) Make sure you read the directions and plumb it to the hot water line. If you plumb it to the cold water line to take advantage of the built in heating element, it won't clean your dishes AT ALL. You'll be quite disappointed!!2) The hoses get quite soft due to the hot water, and they're susceptible to kinking. If this happens you'll have water all over your floor. Error 1 for lack of water input or E4 for a leak on the drainage side. Fortunately, this sucker uses less than 3 gallons per wash, so at least your leak should be limited to that if it's on the drain side (like mine was lol). I ended up trimming my drain hose to avoid that happening again.Lastly, I mounted this under my sink as you can see, and it works perfectly where it's located. I haven't gotten any other errors",

                "reviewText": "Brand new dishwasher constantly displays an \"e4\" error. Will not finish a cycle. Does not drain properly. I thought the problem was the hoses that had to be connected, but those connections are totally secure. It seems to be leaking out the bottom of the dishwasher. Silverware basket handle arrived broken, but I wouldn't have returned the whole thing for that. It was easy enough to install but useless in the state it's in. The service number is limited to 4 hrs per day and seems to have an extremely long wait time for any assistance.UPDATE: I did get ahold of customer service, they quickly sent a replacement dishwasher and I returned the broken one. The service rep indicated that it sounded like a broken pump. The shipping was pretty quick, so I was able to set up the new/ non-broken dishwasher within a week.It works well, my dishes have been clean. The only critique I have of the actual product is that the dishes really don't dry. I just open the dishwasher after the cycle and leave it for an hour or so and everything except plastic air dries that way. I am pretty happy with it as it is. It's not perfect but it has a good capacity and seems like good value for the price.",
