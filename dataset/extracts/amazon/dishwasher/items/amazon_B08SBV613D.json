Virtually nothing to assemble, making it ideal for those who value convenience.Capacity & Size:Its compact design belies its generous capacity. For someone in a studio apartment with a modest collection of dishes, it's more than ample. It handles multiple plates, cups, and even pots with ease.Cleaning Performance:Outstanding. Dishes emerge spotless every time. I typically fill the detergent between half and three-fourths, and the \u2018Eco\u2019 mode, which completes in an hour, consistently delivers pristine results.Noise Level:Almost silent. It's so quiet that it's become a near-invisible fixture just 5 feet from my work desk. It doesn't disturb work meetings and lets me sleep undisturbed.Design & Aesthetics:Sleek, modern, and about half the size of my previous countertop model. On a fun note, I cheekily compare its efficiency to that of a MacBook Pro with a sticker I added. It even outperforms larger, more expensive models.Heat & Drying:One of its standout features is the internal heat. Dishes are cleaned thoroughly thanks to the hot water. A tip: You can skip the '1-hour dry' cycle; the residual heat dries the dishes in minutes once you open the door.Consumption:Economical on water, using around 1.2 gallons per cycle. After three months, I've noticed a reduction in my water bill, with a negligible rise in electricity. It epitomizes energy efficiency.Value & Recommendation:Although pricier than some other compact models, its performance and efficiency justify the cost. A worthy investment for those who prioritize quality.",

                "reviewText": "Living in an apartment with poor water pressure led to the untimely demise of my main dishwasher's impeller, a situation my complex manager has unfortunately chosen not to address. Which led me to searching out for another solution that didn't involve me purchasing and installing another full size dishwasher and letting my rental agency line their pockets. This compact dishwasher has not only solved this issue but also brought a great deal of relief to my family, especially to my wife, who is on dialysis and thus appreciates the reduced physical strain of not having to wash dishes by hand.Here are my thoughts on it so far, after 3 week of use:Installation & Setup:Simple and straightforward, the setup was a breeze. This aspect was crucial for me, considering the need to find an immediate solution to my broken main dishwasher, and as I work 6 days a week as the sole income - didn't need or have the energy to get into yet another fight with yet another kitchen appliance.Design & Capacity:Despite its modest size, this little powerhouse holds a surprising amount of dishes. It's stylish too. It fits right beneath our cupboards on the counter. We do need to pull it out to fill it, but that's a mild inconvenienc.eCleaning Performance:The dishes come out impeccably clean every time, which I was pleasantly surprised by, I was not so keen as to the machine's effective cleaning capabilities. I usually opt for the \u2018Eco\u2019 mode, which is both energy-efficient and thorough. For tougher stuff, I put it on \"strong\" and toss in an extra pod. I would recommend using pods against powder, despite the manufacture recommendation, as the powders seem to leave a residue. Haven't tried jet dry or anything yet, but maybe I will in the future if finances make me be a bit less bougie and I have to go back to powder.Noise Level: Its whisper-quiet operation is also impressive. Being almost silent, it doesn't add any noise stress, which is particularly beneficial in our living situation, as we have a rather finicky two year old.Heat & Drying:The internal heating mechanism not only cleans the dishes effectively (seen it get all the way up to 149 degrees inside; if you open the door during the cycle, it shows the temp inside on the screen, which is a nice safety feature) but also dries them quickly due to the residual heat, bypassing the need for an additional drying cycle, which I thought was pretty neat. It does have some kind of drying cycle, but you don't need to wait for it. The instructions say something about circulating air through it for 72 hours, but as of yet I haven't noticed any kind of whirring, maybe that's select models?Water & Energy Efficiency:Considering the water pressure issues in my apartment, I was again pleasantly surprised at how little water this unit consumes \u2013 about 1.2 gallons per cycle \u2013 without compromising on performance. I've noticed virtually no change to my water bill, despite running it daily.Ease of Use:The user-friendly interface, with its clear LED display, makes operating this dishwasher effortless. This feature has been particularly helpful for my wife, allowing her to manage the dishwashing process without any issues whastoever.Maintenance:Easy-to-clean filters are super easy to snap out, wash and put right back in with minimal trouble.Areas for Improvement:While the dishwasher is nearly perfect for our needs, fitting larger plates can be a bit challenging. Nonetheless, this is a minor inconvenience compared to the overall benefits it provides. I wish it came with a faucet adapter.Conclusion:The Hermitluxe Countertop Dishwasher has been a game-changer in our household. It has effectively addressed the unique challenges we face in our apartment, making life easier for my wife and me. It's been a significant improvement to our daily lives. I highly recommend it to anyone facing similar challenges or simply looking for a reliable, compact dishwashing solution.",

                "reviewText": "My husband and I live in a spacious basement suite but our kitchen counter is still quite small. Dishes pile up fast and since we also have a cat, leaving our dishes on a drying rack wasn't cutting it. (Our kitchen is an open space.) We were nervous about purchasing a countertop dishwasher, but it has turned out to be one of the best investments we have ever made!It is true that the dishwasher doesn't hold a lot, but for basement suite living and a married couple with no kids, it's perfect! We never have dishes lying around anymore and the dishwasher does an amazing job! Our plates, cups, and pans (yes, you can fit a small pan by itself), are spotless and shiny! We barely have to lift a finger, for the dishwasher both washes and dries the dishes for us! The dishwasher is nice and quiet too!We have found it easy to use with no issues at all. If you are finding that water is leaking, it may be that the washer isn't set up properly or that too much water has been used. If you follow the instructions closely, it should be smooth sailing!We have also found that after using the dishwasher for about a week, we don't have to rinse our dishes quite as much before inserting them. Tough spots that took a bit of rinsing/scrubbing and THEN put through the dishwasher, only needed the dishwasher to get the job done after 5 days or so. We are not sure why that is, but that has been our experience!We highly recommend this product and are happy with our purchase. Thank you!PS. If you have novelty mugs/cups that say \"dishwasher safe,\" we either recommend using the gentle cycle or hand-washing it yourself instead. We have had one incident where a novelty cup got melted slightly on one side. However, plastic cups that don't say \"dishwasher safe\", have been fine on the gentle cycle.",

                "reviewText": "This is my review after around 2 months of use.I'm impressed! I purchased this model because it was the only option narrow enough to fit on my countertop (next to the kitchen sink it drains into). I wasn't sure what to expect. I've since saved a huge amount of time and effort washing dishes, and a huge amount of water. Dishes come out clean, with rare exceptions for really caked/baked-on gunk (e.g. egg proteins). Despite having a single spray arm on the bottom, it seems to do a great job of getting water into hard to reach places--for example, cleaning straws no problem.Pros:- The ability to top-fill the dishwasher is great. I was surprised to see it came with a jug for filling, and it requires only around 3 full jugs to fill. I wish the port for filing was slightly more recessed--if I pour too quickly water splashes out, but in reality I can fill the machine in under 1 minute.- It does a great job of heating the water, and displays the temperature of the water when its running. No need to fill with hot water.- It cleans really well, and needs minimal detergent (see below). Glasses that used to look dirty no matter how many times I hand washed them now come out sparklingly clean.A couple downsides:- The dishwasher has no pre-wash detergent holder. In other words, the detergent you put in at the start is the detergent used for the full cycle, unlike some (full size) models that use a prewash cycle for 15 minutes, emptying the gross water, then going on to clean for longer. The upside of not having a prewash detergent door is one fewer thing to go wrong. This model seems quite simple--hopefully that translates to longevity.- Loss of counter space. Unless you want to drain it into a bucket, you're going to want it near a sink, probably. I was glad I measured before I purchased--it just fits in my space.- Unlike some other full size dishwashers, it doesn't appear to have a mechanical blade or pulverizing system for larger chunks of food. While it isn't necessary to hand rinse every dish, I will take steps to quickly scrape off large \"chunks\", as the manual suggests. I also check the filter about once-whenever-I-remember to and have found very small bits of grunge in it. The filter is easy to disassemble and rinse.Some things I have learned:Do not use detergent pods (e.g. the cascade ones) - they contain FAR TOO MUCH detergent for a dishwasher of this size. I made the mistake of buying a large and expensive tub of detergent pods because I bought into the marketing that they would make my dishes cleaner. In reality, too much detergent consistently left my dishes smelling, even tasting, like detergent. YuckAfter watching a video on the channel \"Technology Connections\" on YT about detergent packs, I decided to give the cheap powdered soap a try. Not only am I saving about 90% of what the pods were costing, but my dishes come out just as clean, AND without the smell caused by using far too much detergent. Save your money and buy the cheap powder (not gels).As others have pointed out, this is a really small machine, good for one or two people at most. For me, it's been a godsend--no more pre-soaking dishes in the sink, no more anxiety-inducing piles of dishes in moments I get way too busy. It's given me back hours of my week.",
