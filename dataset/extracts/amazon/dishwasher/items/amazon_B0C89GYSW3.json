                "reviewText": "Picked it up just in time to replace my old junk dishwasher with a new model which used different connections from the old one. Great kit and really good selection of quality brass parts. Seals were nice and soft and threads were cut well. No issues at all. No leaks, no kinks, no problems. The supply line was also very well made and the perfect length for my installation. Comes with extra adapters which will save someone time from having to run around looking for 3/8\" to1/2\" should they end up needing them. The only parts not included (not really expected them to be) was a hose clamp for the dishwasher drain line to disposal or obviously the electrical cable (which was salvaged from the old unit). Highly recommended.",
