                "reviewText": "Originally bought it to paint mugs. Used modge podge after using acrylic paint on mugs. Followed all the directions to try to make sure I was doing so correctly in terms of number of layers, curing time, etc. They cured for over a month before being run through the dishwasher (top rack). Dishwasher totally destroyed the decorations on the mugs. Was not a fan of modge podge.However, later, I had two puzzles to try to glue for hanging. One had already been glued to a backboard but the puzzle glue really didn't work and the backboard peeled right off, as did much of the puzzle. So I figured I had a ton of modge podge left. Put down some wax paper and used a rubber brush to spread modge podge on the front and back of the puzzle (two layers on each side, drying then rotating between layers--change wax paper as needed too). Worked very well. No backer board needed at all. If you plan to hang it on hooks, 4 layers is great. If you plan to stand a puzzle up freestanding, you will need more layers or a backboard, as it will bend, especially the 1000 piece or larger sizes. Learned the hard way.I was able to finish two puzzles using most of the bottle since I had only otherwise used the bottle for two mugs. Since modge podge redeemed itself in this manner, I may buy more later. Wish it would have worked for the mugs though.",
