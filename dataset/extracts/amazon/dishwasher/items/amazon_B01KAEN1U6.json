I've looked around and that isnt easy to find. Being pre-clipped with that adapter makes it very convenient as well. The bad? It used to be about $8... at the time of this writing this wire is being sold for $17, but you can find this wire at the home despot for $12. Also the adapter is for 3/8in knock outs and in most cases will wiggle around after you install it. You can buy the connector, the wire, and the wire nuts seperately and save a good amount of money or just go buy the kit at a big box store because in terms of value it just isnt worth it.",

After some research found this complete kit with all of the necessary pieces. I did have to replace cable clip (not sure of the term) as gray one included was too small snap into place, was just worried about tension on the wire if I pulled my dishwasher out. That was mainly due to my model dishwasher. Could not find a similar kit in any of the local big box retailers and an electrician was going to cost $150 to hardwire it in.",
