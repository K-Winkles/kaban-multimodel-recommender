                "reviewText": "I'm not someone who generally reviews things unless they're really good or really bad. In thise case, they're REALLY GOOD!I first bought this set (4 cloths 2 scrubbers) in February of 2020. To be honest I was purchasing something else at the time that was really inexpensive and would only ship for free if you added it to an order. I needed some new dish cloths so after reading reviews on some different ones I landed on these.Over the last 5 years I've been trying to do away with as many single use products as possible because I hate waste, unnecessary trash, etc. I've been using an old fashioned style safety razor to shave for about 4 years now because the blades are insanely cheap, recyclable, and there's no plastic cartridges, plastic handles, etc. I bought a pack of washable/reusable cotton rounds so I no longer buy normal cotton rounds or balls anymore. I have mesh drawstring bags that I take grocery shopping for produce instead of using the plastic bags hanging in the produce section. Aside from needing to add something to get free Prime shipping I decided on these because they're reusable, machine washable, and had 2 scrubbers included.I really wasn't expecting much. I mean, a dish cloth is a dish cloth right? WRONG!I used my first cloth in February 2020 and literally used that same one for 9 or 10 months. Whenever I ran the dishwasher I would stick the cloth and scrubber in there to clean them and if I wasn't using the dishwasher I just threw them into the washing machine. I honestly cannot believe how strong, durable, and long lasting these things are! After 10ish months I wore a hole in the cloth while scrubbing my cheese grater and not paying attention. Once I wore the hole in it I retired it from dishes and used it for cleaning around the house. I then grabbed one of the 3 cloths left, used that for dishes/kitchen counters. I gave a 3rd cloth away to a friend after telling her she had to try them. We purchased a new house and moved in December 2020 and somehow I lost my cloth with the hole and the one I was using for the kitchen so I only had one left. I started using it the day we moved in 12.07.2020 and wore a little hole in it today scrubbing something rough in the sink.I really cannot say enough great things about these cloths. They're strong, durable, and last pretty much forever. Once they get a little worn out (if ever) I just use them for cleaning around the house. When this new set comes I'm going to retire the 4th of my original pack to be a bathroom cleaning cloth.The scrubbers are just as if not more durable than the cloths. I gave my friend one of the two scrubbers when I gave her the cloth. That means I've been using my one scrubber since Feb 2020 and it still works as well as the day I opened it.I forgot to mention that these are great for wiping up spills as they're super absorbent.I'm sorry that this review is all over the place and long winded.Tl;dr - The cloths and scrubbers are great, durable, absorbent, have a ton of uses, and can be thrown in the washing machine or dishwasher. Do yourself a favor and buy some!",

                "reviewText": "These attractive scrubbers are really effective at removing even the toughest burnt-on food from pots and pans . They work better than the scrubbers with sponges on the back - no more smelly, sodden, germ-laden items near the sink. They are safe to use on all types of pans and stove-tops; I\u2019ve never had one do any damage to any surface in the 2 years I\u2019ve been using them. And when you think they need a bit of freshening up, they go in the dishwasher. They are not absorbent so they are no good for surface wiping, I use a Swedish dishcloth for that",
