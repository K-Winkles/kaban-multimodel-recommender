                "reviewText": "This is a high quality dishwasher hose and the quality fittings made it easy to install. My dishwasher water valve failed and when I purchased a new valve I also purchased this hose. The installation was easy and the added fittings meant that I didn't have to purchase new fittings separately. I got an unexpected benefit from this hose. The old copper pipe created a loud noise whenever the dishwasher was filling with water. Now with this hose the water fill is completly silent which adds to the tranquility of my kitchen. I would recommend a length of hose that will permit the dishwasher to be pulled out for service without having to disconnect the water hose.",

                "reviewText": "So we did not use this product for its intended purpose, but instead chose it to convert our shower head into a water-inlet for our portable washing machine. The hose and connectors provided with our machine only allowed for hookup in the kitchen, which is just not a solution for us. This is the perfect device to be able to hook the inlet up to where the shower hose is normally connected and then have a leak-proof connector for the back of the machine. Comes with a super sturdy hose and all the adapters you could possibly need to make that situation work, also a great price for the quality.",
