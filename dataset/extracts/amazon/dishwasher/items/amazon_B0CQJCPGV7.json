Though there is a closed-off butter section on the door it can, in its waxed paper wrapper, be messy when you want to use it. So I'd sometimes on a small dish on a shelf. But I got tired of those two unsatisfactory choices.The obvious solution was a butter dish. Enter this Hekeieon one. Though plastic (BPA-free), it is solid and hefty without being heavy. The quality is definitely there. Small ridges prevent the butter ffrom moving around as it might do otherwise when soft. There are also tablespoon markings for noting baking quantities, especially handy when the wrapper is gone. The top is a snug fit so that no smells get in or out and it won't fall out of place when you carry it from refrigerator to table and bac again. And finally, it is a beautifully designed, something you don't often seen manufacturers pay attention to in less expensive and certainly in everyday, mundane items. But that attention to detail is here and for all those reasons it is worth buying even if you have one now.Definitely highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice looking butter dish, it is made with quality material, a hard plastic bottom that is not cheap looking at all. The clear plastic upper has nice curves and the set gives off a look of elegance and you can sit this on the dinner table and it would even fit in with your everyday dinnerware and maybe even your fancier china. The description states it is roomy enough for both the East/West Coast butter, I am on the east coast and had to look up the difference, apparently the west coast's sticks of butter are shorter and wider. It does not fit the Irish butter blocks which are too wide, probably the same width as two regular sticks side by side, regular meaning East Coast butter. There are markings on the floor of the dish to measure tablespoons, which is convenient. The cover fits into a grove on the bottom to seal in freshness but it does not lock into the bottom. This is an impressive butter dish and cover for the price, a lot of thought was put into the design, simple, nice looking and easy to work with.",

                "reviewText": "I like this. It's good-looking, clear and clean, sort of retro-looking. I used to keep the butter hidden in the cupboard because my cat would jump up on the counter and lick the butter. When I needed to get some dishes, I had to manage around the butter I was hiding. Now the cat has moved on and I can have a regular butter dish handy.I like that this has markings showing how to make evenly-spaced cuts. I like the little ridge that keeps your butter from sliding off the end of the dish. I like that it's sized for both short wide cubes and longer thinner ones. I like how snugly the lid sits over the bottom.One caveat though. The first thing I did when I got this was run it through the dishwasher to see if it's really dishwasher safe. It is. But one word of advice: be sure to put the bottom the right way around or the lid won't sit right and for two days you'll be unhappy until you figure out your mistake!",

It\u2019s dishwasher friendly and did not warp or disfigure at all after going through a dishwasher cycle I love that it has the measuring lines on the base so it is easy to cut a butter stick to the appropriate amount needed.I believe this is supposed to be able to be used to keep butter on the counter but I have not tried that yet. I know there are a number of types of containers in which you can keep butter on the counter, but it ooks me out not to keep butter refrigerated so I haven\u2019t tested it. Overall, I love this butter dish for its sleek look and easy to clean style.",

                "reviewText": "I like to keep the butter out so that it's easier to spread, but I never liked just leaving it out in the open so I ordered this. It's the perfect size for 1 bar of butter, and it keeps the butter safe from dust and whatever else might be floating in the air. It's nothing too fancy, but it makes the table look more put together.",

                "reviewText": "I am so happy that I ordered this Hekeleon butter dish! We have used the same butter dish for many years now, and it is nowhere near as nice as this one is--even when it was brand new. This one is so attractive; the base is a good, hard plastic (with a non-slip base), and the clear plastic cover looks as nice as if it were a glass cover. We keep our butter on the counter, but I may now move this one to the kitchen table, as nice as it looks. I am very pleased to have found this, especially at the amazing price of $6.99! FIVE stars!",

The base has just enough friction to stop it from sliding around on your counter. Best of all, it won't break (I definitely did not order this after shattering a ceramic butter dish).",
