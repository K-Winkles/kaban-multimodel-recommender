                "reviewText": "I didn't want to pay this kind of money, when it was so much cheaper to buy Cascade, etc. at the grocery store . . . but I was desperate. My flatware was coming out very streaked and my glassware was looking worse and worse, to the point where I was reduced to hand-washing it. Not fun! Since I had to order the salt anyway, I decided to try the tabs and rinse aid just once. They immediately made a HUGE difference! No more fog and streaks on my glasses, or anything else. I am cutting the tabs in half and only using the one half per load. No problems at all that way. And, I am convinced! It is so worth the extra money to get beautifully clean dishes!*** By the way, be very careful unscrewing and then re-screwing the cap on the salt reservoir when refilling it. I did not get my cap on tight enough when re-screwing it back on, and as a result, water leaked into the pan below, setting off the alarm. $177 and an appliance repair later, I found out what I did wrong. That was a painful, costly and very avoidable mistake!",
