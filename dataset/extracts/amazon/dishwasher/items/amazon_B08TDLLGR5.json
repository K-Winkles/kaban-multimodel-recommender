So I can say the dishes look great, they are dry, and no spotting of any kind. Cascade is all I will use, my days of thinking I can cheap out and use other stuff are over. I noticed the wheels on the basket and drawer roll better with this in use, and also no white calcium deposits in my dishwasher.",

I have a smaller SPT 18-inch portable dishwasher that has a rinse aid dispensing system built in, and I use typical single-ingredient detergent pacs in it. It's always done a good job, and the dishes have always come out clean but OH MY GOSH when I put this Cascade Rinse Aid in there, the difference is AMAZING. My dishes actually come out with a shine to them, and they FEEL much cleaner, as if a residue I never had noticed before was suddenly removed, leaving the dishes almost brand new in feel.Be warned: This stuff is addictive. Once you start using it, you'll want to keep using it forever!",
