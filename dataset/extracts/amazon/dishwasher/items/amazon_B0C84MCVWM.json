                "reviewText": "We moved into a house with new dishwasher and a small kitchen, so we needed a compact dishwasher to be sure we didn't take up too much room. I was worried that we were going to have to run loads constantly, but it actually holds a lot more than I thought it would. It actually cleans better than the kenmore we had at our last house. I love the 1 hr quick wash function, as if we do have a couple loads piling up we can power through them quicker than normal.",

                "reviewText": "We are in the process of remodeling our kitchen, and since all new appliances are on the agenda, I got us this Midea Slimline Built-in Dishwasher.As shown in my pics, this dishwasher is compact in size; it is much smaller than the old, full-size model that came with our house, which stopped working a couple of years ago. But once we get all new cabinets installed, it will fit perfectly flush.Since we were just replacing, installation wasn\u2019t difficult; took my husband about 2 hours to remove the old unit and get this one installed. A detailed installation manual is included in the box.Having a 22-month-old granddaughter, I will say that it\u2019s hard to keep her fingerprints off of it, but this is an awesome machine!I love the digital control panel, with the LED display; it\u2019s very user-friendly and holds more dishes than one would think; perfect for our small family.I really love the 1-hour quick wash option and the sanitizing function; having another granddaughter due any day, this dishwasher will safely clean her bottles.Overall, we are thoroughly impressed with this slimline dishwasher; it\u2019s beautiful, quiet, easy-to-use, and gets all of our dishes nice and clean on every cycle.Highly recommend!!",

We have built a home for her in the back of our home, it is not huge but it is a perfect size for her to be comfortable. The kitchen is not huge and this is perfect for that space.We are happy that we found this, it is a great size for smaller spaces and for smaller loads of dishes. I cant wait until we get her place done and to get the kitchen done and this installed. I think this will be perfect and will work great for her. She cant stand for extended periods of time, so this will be great for her.It is a stainless steel, sleek looking dishwasher.",

                "reviewText": "What a great little dishwasher! Ordered for a vacation home as we didn't need a normal full size dishwasher there, and this has not disappointed! While it is smaller than a regular dishwasher it still holds a great amount of dishes. It was actually surprisingly lightweight as well. Easy to install, my husband has installed other dishwashers for us before so it wasn't to hard to do. Did take a little bit of time but came with full assembly instructions so even someone who has never done this before can do so. Dishwasher is quiet and plays a nice little tune when finished. Has several washing modes to choose from which I love because not ever load is the same! Does a fantastic job at getting dishes clean. I would definitely recommend this.",
