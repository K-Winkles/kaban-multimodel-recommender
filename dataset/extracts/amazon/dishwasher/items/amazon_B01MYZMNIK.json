My cats still move their food to the floor to eat it (they have no brains) but it works well for my cat that likes to take a bath in the water bowl while he eats, which often results in the entire contents of the bowl being spilled onto my kitchen floor. The raised edge of the mat contains spills, keeping post-dinner/bath cleanups to a minimum. I have 4 bowls on this mat and they fit nicely, I\u2019d probably recommend a larger one if you have a large dog or something with several bowls, but my cats just have 1 cup bowls so this works for us.",

It\u2019s awkward to clean in the sink and has to be laid flat to dry. Since I have wood floors I can\u2019t put the mat back down until it\u2019s dry, and the weight and thickness make it tricky to find a place to keep it in between meals. Overall it does what it\u2019s supposed to do but I\u2019d recommend buying a dark color and being sure you have somewhere to keep the wet mat before buying.",
