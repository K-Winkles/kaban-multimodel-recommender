Seventh Generation dishwasher packs offer a convenient and powerful clean that blasts through tough residue to leave your dishes streak-free with just one wash, no pre-rinse necessary. Our single dose dishwasher tabs come in a dissolvable PVA film that can be tossed right into the dishwasher for a hassle-free alternative to traditional powders and gels \u2013 no need to unwrap or measure. Seventh Generation Free & Clear Dishwasher Detergent Packs are made with plant-based ingredients free of fragrances, dyes, phosphates, and chlorine bleach. Because trust us, we can handle the job without them. For more than 25 years, Seventh Generation has been thoughtfully formulating safe and effective plant-based products that work. Really well. Our dish detergent uses powerful plant-based ingredients like surfactants and enzymes to break down tough residue and lift away food, leaving your dishes sparkling clean. So, how does it all work? The enzymes cut through grease and food by breaking down starch and protein-based residue while the surfactants remove dirt and grease by holding the molecules in suspension, so they can wash away. Yes, even those fussy egg stains. Based in Vermont, Seventh Generation is proud to be a Certified B Corporation. B Corps are certified to be better for workers, better for communities, and better for the environment. By choosing Seventh Generation dishwasher soap products, you\u2019re joining us in nurturing the health of the next seven generations.",

                "reviewText": "I used to think I had a really bad dishwasher, even though it is only about five years old. I hated the job it did so much that I stopped using it for two years and did all my dishes by hand. I recently decided to give it another try and found I still was dissatisfied. My dishes seemed never to come out really clean -- which was particularly evident on the silverware -- and the whole unit smelled bad. Then one day I received a sample of Seventh Generation Dishwasher Detergent. I tried it and I FELL IN LOVE! My dishes came out squeaky-clean and sparkling -- silverware, glasses, everything. I do still rinse, etc., as one should, before loading, but I've always done that, and I still have never gotten this kind of results! The sample included two pods, but I didn't even wait to use the second one. I immediately ordered a bagful, and I have not been sorry. I don't even need a rinse agent when I use these pods. It is now a pleasure to use my dishwasher. I am thrilled to have found this product!",

From my local discount store and natural foods store I've bought the smaller quantity boxes that come with non-recyclable plastic bags inside. I was excited to see this plastic container on Amazon. What I received was a big cardboard box (recyclable) but with two bags of pods inside. I tried and failed. Sad.I do love the detergent -which is why it has 4 stars. (5 if I had received what I expected.) I turned to this natural brand after another one etched some glasses.I also wish 7th Generation still made this in the boxes of loose detergent where I could pour it into the little dispensers myself. Old school but nothing wrong with that, it works great.",

When my steel coffee tumblers started tasting like the smell, I decided to try something else. We've used 7th Generation liquid laundry product for many years, so I ordered some dishwasher pods. I truly believe it cleans better than Cascade and does not smell. The pods never get hard from storing under the sink (like the Cascade pods) and it is easily shaped to fit the dispenser.
