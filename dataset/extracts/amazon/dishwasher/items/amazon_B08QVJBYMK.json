        "description": "Cascade Platinum + Oxi ActionPacs are our most powerful ActionPacs providing a deep hygienic clean you can see & feel. It breaks down food soils to clean 99% of visible & invisible food residue (inanimate in nature), and washes them away so they do not redeposit on your dishes. Plus, Platinum + Oxi is our best stain-fighting ActionPac, fighting tough food & Beverage stains for virtually spotless dishes, every time. And it contains no Chlorine bleach. Cascade Platinum +Oxi cleans burnt-on messes in just one wash, with no pre-wash needed. That's because Platinum has 50% more cleaning power (% cleaning ingredients vs. Cascade Complete ActionPacs) to tackle burnt-on foods. It dissolves fast to start cleaning right away, releasing the soaking power of Dawn dishwashing liquid, while food-seeking enzymes latch on and break down food into particles so small they can flow right down the drain. It's so powerful it even works in the quick wash cycle. Plus, Cascade Platinum dishwashing detergent is formulated to help prevent hard-water filming-keeping your machine looking fresh and clean. Simply pop in an ActionPac and reveal a Platinum sparkle. Save up to 15 gallons of water per dishwasher load when you skip the pre-wash and run your dishwasher With Cascade Platinum. #1 Recommended Brand in North America more dishwasher brands in North America recommend Cascade vs. Any other automatic dishwashing detergent brand, recommendations as part of co-marketing agreements.",

                "reviewText": "I had tried the plus version of this and it leaves a heavy smell on the plastic dishes/cups. I think it\u2019s the rinse agent. This one doesn\u2019t have that strong smell, well not much of it. So this cleans great, without the heavy smell. If you think it\u2019s just me, my dog refused to eat her bones out of a bowl washed in the plus version. But was okay with this one. Gets stuff clean, absolutely!",

They clean very well and don't leave a lot spots. I would recommend them to anyone looking for dishwashing pods.",
