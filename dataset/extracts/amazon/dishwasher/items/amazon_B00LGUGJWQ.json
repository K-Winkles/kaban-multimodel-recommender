                "reviewText": "Calling this rack Junk is being kind. It's slightly narrower than the original part so the wheels constantly fall off the tracks, usually when it's fully loaded. There are already tiny rust specs in some joints after a few months of normal use, which must be patched using food grade sealant or they will quickly spread. The arrangement of dish holders is 'ok'; not as good as the original factory part, but adequate.This is the second replacement I have purchased. The first completely rusted out in sections and began to fall apart after 14 months. The original factory part lasted many, many years longer. Now I'm left with a perfectly functioning dishwasher that requires a new lower rack every 18 months and new upper rack every 24 months, because GE can't be bothered to produce quality replacement parts. It's disgraceful. What is even more disgraceful is charging this much for this piece of garbage.",

The wheel replacement was easy and the rack fits perfectly. Hopefully will get a few more years use from my 16 year old dishwasher.",

The rack is the same but the thin wheels make it not usable. But I removed the front four wheels and put them on the new rack and all was well, again the original had wide wheels twice as wide as the rear?? Otherwise, it's fine, but if you don't have wide wheels to swap them it will not fit properly. It also seems a bit pricy for a wire rack. But thay are like most parts expensive.",
