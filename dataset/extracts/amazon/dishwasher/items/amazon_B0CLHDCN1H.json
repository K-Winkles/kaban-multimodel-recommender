But unfortunately I did not have the power supply for it! It was all hooked up but with no power. So this was a perfect find! It is at a wonderful price and very easy to install. All you have to do is hook up the existing wires with the wires for the power cord and it worked great! Thank you",

The end connectors were very easy to to hook up to the dishwasher. I like that it is UL certified, and that the cord itself seems to be quite heavy duty. Using this cord is a great option if you don't already have hard wiring in place.",
