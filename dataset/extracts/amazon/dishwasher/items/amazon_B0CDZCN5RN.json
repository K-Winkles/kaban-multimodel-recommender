I find if i put some dawn dishwashing liquid with these pads it cleans really good.. i noticed when i first used them they were cleaning the clothes good... but i wanted better so i just started using Dawn with them as well.. it works well together and my clothes smell super good and super fresh... its better than all those harsh detergents and oh so light weight.. I would recommend anyone who washes clothes to give this a try... think you will be pleased as i am with this..",

They are very convenient, too. The box takes up very little space in my limited laundry room cupboards. And, unlike detergent pods, the sheets are conveniently perforated so that a half sheet can be used in smaller loads. The fragrance of the sheets prior to use is a bit too potent for my sensitive nose; however, the scent does not linger on the washed clothing. Convenient, reasonably priced, and much better for our troubled environment than are plastic jugs.",

The scent is a little strong when opening the pack (for those of you with sensitivities) i just keep the inside liner bag closed, but no heavy perfume once washed, and no skin irritations. I am definitely going to continue purchasing. I use a half sheet for most of my loads, with good results and a full sheet for extra large or more heavily soiled items",

After this I decided to find dishwasher strips - also good for the environment and I have been extremely pleased. Not only do my dishes come clean, they come sparkling clean.
