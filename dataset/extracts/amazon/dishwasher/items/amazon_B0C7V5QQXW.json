With the button to push to open the container, my son can\u2019t open it without my help (yet :)). With it being plastic I no longer worry about him breaking it or getting hurt if it were to drop. I highly recommend. The only aspect some might have an issue with is you have to push the button just right for it to open. It cleans easily and the measurements on the holder make it that much easier to know how much butter you are using.",
