I use the antibacterial 4 wash setting since I wash dog dishes and my coffee cups together.It would be great if there was a fill line on the water tank.

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Attached is a video of when we first got it. I have a love hate with this dishwasher. We live off septic so do not have a dishwasher, we plan on putting one in eventually but I have never hated doing dishes so much! This dishwasher helps some with that stress. I have 3 kids so if I don\u2019t do dishes immediately after dinner, it\u2019s easy for the dishes to get piled up, which unfortunately happens quite frequently and then I\u2019m at the sink for AT LEAST an hour. This dishwasher is small, maybe holds 4 bowls at a time to give reference. The instructions were useless, gave no indication of anything. Luckily everything was fairly easy to figure out. Except where the soap is suppose to be. We just place it on the rack and I suppose it works pretty well. The lid is finicky\u2026if you have anything that\u2019s too tall, or makes it wobble and not sit perfectly on there, there\u2019s no way make it lock. The \u201clock\u201d button is just for the button features. Not for the lid. So sometimes I have felt the need to put something heavy on top to weight the lid down. I have found from experience also that I have to check that the back hose is correctly secured EVERY single use because on 2 occasions, it came undone so I had water everywhere (the first time I caught in time). Must need to clean it pretty good on occasion also because for a couple days, the spinning part decided randomly not to work, then started randomly working again but slowly. We cleaning some of the holes out with a toothpick and it seems to be working correctly again\u2026.even with all this complaint, I can still give it a 3 star because it\u2019s fast and I can load 4 bowls up, walk away, do something else, and come back shortly to load up a few more.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The Good: Great for daily dish washing. I work on a military base in the Middle East and have been carrying my dirty dishes to the shower room for years; not going to wash them in the bathroom. This is a great solution for me as I can wash my dishes in the office during the day. So no more stacks of accumulated dirty dishes.The Bad: This device isn't smart. I have to use a step down transformer and the unit I was using could not support the wattage. I started a load and it tripped. Because I'm a guy and believe it could have been a fluke I reset and tried again. That also tripped. The problem is that the unit has no monitoring of the current water level in the washer. So unit would fill, as soon as cycle began it would trip, reset the power, if filled again, reset the power after changing out the step down transformer, and it filled a third time. So I had a cascading waterfall in my office. Luckily, I had a large towel nearby and contained the spill. To be fair there is a drain option I could have chosen, but I didn't want to waste the soap and water loaded. So don't do what I did and you will be fine. Also, there are 2 thin cracks in the dome cover. Package was very well packed and not pointing fingers here, but it looks like they may have shipped a damaged unit to me.Overall: I have 2 gallon jugs filled with water. One gallon will fill the reservoir and I have a bucket to collect the drainage. Speaking of the drain, the hose is held only by friction. I pushed in onto the drain valve but it may come loose. Best to reinforce it with a small hose clamp. Unit does very well with stoneware, plastic plates will require a pre-wash. There is a small platform for silverware, but I chose to add a steel basket I had laying around to hold my daily silverware. Fun to watch it wash the dishes. Plan out your spot and drainage and you will be good. With all the above considered, I like it.",
