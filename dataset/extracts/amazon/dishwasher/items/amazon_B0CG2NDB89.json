We currently use a small square of paper attached to a magnetic clip that we flip over to indicate the state of the dishwasher. It's effective but not attractive.This sign is well constructed, with a slider that allows you to switch between the clean/dirty states. It's a little bigger than I think it needs to be, but that's a personal preference. What I don't like is the cheap magnetic backing. It does not adequately fix to our surface (we use the side of our refrigerator, which is ferromagnetic, whereas our dishwasher's brushed stainless is not). The sign is already fairly weighty, already so a strong magnet is necessary to support its weight. I tested the magnet on other surfaces - including a whiteboard designed for magnetic clips - and the sign would barely adhere.I like the sign. I do not like the magnet. I will probably glue a stronger magnet to the back and maybe still be able to put it to use.",

                "reviewText": "Tired of constantly having to check with the whole family about the status of the dishes in the dishwasher? Or trying to Sherlock Holmes your way to the answer by inspecting the dishes in the washer for food remnants or pooled water? I can't count the number of times over the years I've had to say, \"Is the dishwasher dirty or clean?\" - shouted as people race out the door, texted on the fly, yelled across the house, first thing in the morning, etc. Ugh.I like this product because it uses both writing and color coding (red-green, intuitive) to indicate the dish status, sits unobtrusively on the outside of the dishwasher while still being big enough to easily read, and has a no-effort slide mechanism to change between \"Dirty\" and \"Clean\" options - which means that you can note if it's half-full of dirty dishes it's still dirty, and if it's clean but you pop a fork out and leave the rest for someone else to unload, there's never any question as to the status of the rest of the dishes as long as you switch it from \"dirty to clean\" as soon as you set it to run, and conversely switch from \"clean\" to \"dirty\" as soon as you unload it. Incredibly easy to do as you shut the door.Overall an easy way to communicate the status of the dishes without having to chase down the last person who used the dishwasher.The packaging is nice, and the adhesive options are a magnet and extra included stickers if your dishwasher does not have a metal exterior. The only question I have is whether the magnet might over time disrupt the computer in the dishwasher, but that's mostly because I have no idea how strong a magnet has to be (or how long it has to be in close proximity to computer components) to cause an issue.",
