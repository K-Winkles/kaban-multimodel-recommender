                "reviewText": "I know they are called cocettes, but I'm not familiar with the word, yet. These little pots are so cute! And we have used them, so far, for heating up soup and other dishes, and of course they are perfect for eating from, too. They are just the right size for one serving. I tried them because we've had a set of French white Corning dishes for decades, and only 2 are left with one ceramic cover. I was trying to find spare covers for these when I came across these adorable little cocettes. (I never did find any Corning covers, or Corning dishes with covers, available.) I love the bright colors and chose red. They are tough and very easy to clean. I saw a reviewer complained about the knobs, but I don't have a problem with them. They would also make great presents for grown kids, so I may stock up throughout the year with that in mind.",

                "reviewText": "I bought the teal ombre pots and they're beautiful in person. They look a lot more expensive than they are. The handles are thin and delicate. Only one arrived with a broken handle. It broke off cleanly and I glued it back together with clear gorilla glue - it looks like new now. The seller also sent a card with info about contacting them since ceramics are hard to ship, so I'm sure they would have replaced it if I'd asked. I got these for air fryer meal prep for lunches and they work fantastic for that. I would recommend these pots.",

I can make personal sized baked pastas and it makes good for roasting veggies as well for sauces. How ever if you don't want something smaller don't get these. these are basically personal sized pots. But I really like these",
