                "reviewText": "This butter dish to attractive, the lid knob it great, and it is long enough for a normal butter cube, but its not high or wide enough for typical \"West Coast\" sticks that are shorter/fatter. So the butter sticks to lid when try to lift it, and the sides get all smudged so looks messy all the time. Would work fine If was 1/2 inch taller/wider, would be great dish. Otherwise, only recommend if you use the \"East Coast\" style sticks that are long and skinny.",
