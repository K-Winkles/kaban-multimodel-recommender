                "reviewText": "I ordered this butter dish after our previous one got broke, and I tried a different option that just wasn\u2019t suitable. This one is perfect. The size is substantial, and enough to hold a fresh stick along with remnants from the old stick. The lid sits on a rim or channel around the dish, keeping it from sliding around; the lid is also generously sized to prevent the butter from smashing onto it. I thought I would hate the raised grooves on the bottom of the tray, but I love this feature most. They give the knife a stopping point, and allow the butter to collect on the knife instead of having butter smear all over the tray. The weight of this feels nice in the hand, and it does come in other color options. The simple design suits my taste- overall I\u2019m very happy with this purchase.",

Handle was tapered so you couldn't pick it up, the sides were so narrow they were caked with butter all the time and you couldn't set the lid down because it left butter smeared everywhere on the counter. This jewel solves all those problems and more. It's hard to believe someone could screw up a simple butter dish but they did. This guy works perfect. I strongly recommend this dish over the others.",
