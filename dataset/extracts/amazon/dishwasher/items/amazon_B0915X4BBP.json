                "reviewText": "I have run this baby a total of 81 times at this point. We are a family of 5, with boys in school and daycare. We live in a rent to own situation so until we own this house we cannot go gutting the kitchen that was built in the 50s. Our counter space is limited along with floor space so we don't have the room to store a full sized washer. Instead this dishwasher sits next to the sink on the counter space that was previously taken by the drying rack. What drew me to this dishwasher was the ability to fill the tank and not needing to buy adapters for my sink. I can run the dishwasher and then hand wash my pans at the same time. Also if anyone else lives in an older home, they will also know the fun game of not being able to wash dishes while someone showers because it will take all the hot water. The tank eliminates that issue and I am able to put a load in before bed and go take a shower without fear.My husband enjoys hand washing dishes while I do not, because while I wash dishes my kids are off finding trouble. I also enjoy the baby cycle for pet bowls /gecko decor and it would of been a huge blessing when my youngest was a baby and needing bottles for daycare. Any parent or parent to be who is currently hand washing bottles and then microwave sterilizing will understand the blessing that is not having to scrub little parts and having everything sterilized and ready to go. I can also say that because it heats the water it is saving us money on oil because we are not hand washing in hot water that was heated by oil.My kids love helping load/unload the dishwasher and the glass window is built in entertainment for them. I will say a con is the size but in the same breath it is a pro because we don't have the room for something bigger.My only other cons are that there is no rinse aid compartment but I remedy that by using cascade platinum pods, and that I can't put the wire prongs up and down like other models. The upper sprayer arm doesn't always start spinning right away, but if you leave it alone it will start spinning after the first 2 minutes of the cycle.Things I wanted to know when I was looking at dishwashers and landed on this model.1) I have Mikasa dish sets from Costco. They all fit no issue and I can fit 10 plates (good to know if you host)2) I can fit my kids bentigo lunch boxes I recommend vertical to prevent the clips from hanging down and interfering with the sprayer arm.3) I can fit a 7 qt bowl and strainer along with a whisk and measuring cup no issue4) I run multiple loads a day but I would also hand wash multiple loads a day. So it's not a big deal. What I could fit on the dish rack is what I can fit into the dishwasher but I don't need to had wash and hand dry them so major win. I also get the pods from Costco and buy a couple boxes when they are on sale.5) I cannot fit my largest baking pan in the dishwasher but I can fit my smaller ones. I also can't fit a normal cookie sheet, but I can fit my smaller ones which might be a bonus for people who live in small apartments or are 1-2 personal household. I can fit a crock pot and large pots, along with small cutting boards.6) most dishes can be run on a quick cycle especially if they were just used. Normal is good for your items used for cooking or kids school lunch boxes that you want a little more heat and a longer cycle. Baby/heavy is awesome for pet /bottles and if everyone in the house is dealing with sickness like strep and Covid where you would like to light everything on fire but can't.7) fruit wash works fine I normally wash my fruits in veggie wash and soak them for way too long so being able to put all the apples (15) and filling the basket with grapes/strawberries/ blueberries saves time and I can load it and run it while I put my other groceries away. I do recommend cleaning your filter prior to running it 8) you do not need to use the pitcher to fill the machine we just use the hose from our sink and it beeps when it is full9) the suction cup and hose stay in the sink without issue. We have the suction cup 4in from the top of the hose in the sink.10) the top rack ment for cups is great for the munchkin lids for sippy cups and straws easily fit in the wholes for the silverware.11) the sound the dishwasher makes is melodic. It doesn't bother me at all, quite the opposite it actually pleases me. The light turns on when you open the door, and when you first power it on and stays on for 1-2 minutes. If your kids are like mine and they \"need to see\" you can pause the cycle open the door and close it and the light will be back on while it washes but fear not, no water will leak when you do that, but it can be steamy and hot so I don't recommend littles doing it on their own. It's nice to know though that if my kids opened the door mid cycle I wouldn't have a bunch of hot soapy water pouring out.Overall this dishwasher has changed my life, keeps my sink clean and makes it so I don't dread hosting a party. I will need to do multiple loads ie plates/silverware, cups and desert items, prep items, and cooking items. However, It makes it so I have more time to spend with my guest instead of standing at the sink and hand washing a ton of dishes.",

                "reviewText": "It never occurred to me dishwashers came in small, compact units like this and I've never owned even a large one. Desperation made me look - and desperation also made me buy it despite the relatively few reviews at the time.What I wanted out of this unit:1. To fit at least three, if not four place settings.2. To have a tank and not require a sink hookup because my apartment already has a weird attachment to the sink that won't allow something like this.3. To lessen the water I use washing dishes.4. To clean Tupperware! I struggle with them as they build up quickly and I can't handle the recommended hot water to get the grease off easier.Does it do these things? Yes!I have a dish set that includes the somewhat large, square plates. They do NOT fit in this unit unless I turn them sharply diagonal and take up most of the space. I DID know this would probably be the case when I picked it because I saw another reviewer complain about it and I measured it myself. I decided that was okay, I've only got four of them, and if it can take care of all my bowls and cups and the freakin' Tupperware, I'd be happy.When it arrived, it was packaged well. Had a brief period of concern because the inside had obvious water residue and condensation but then I read this is due to factory testing before shipping and not unusual.Had another moment of concern when any dishes that weren't ceramic (aka, plastic like the handles of silverware and my nemesis, the Tupperware) came out covered in white residue. It left an almost fine, powdery fog on them and actual, scrape-able white residue. Experimented - turns out I have very, very hard water. For me personally, the Finish Powerball we originally tried did not work despite being recommended for hard water, not even if we used less or more of it. What DID work was Cascade Premium - no more residue!! So it definitely wasn't the unit's fault and now it works great!!!I run this unit once or twice a day. Being able to just stick most of the day's dirty dishes inside and walk away is great. The dry mode is fine - it does not get them completely dry as water collects and remains on top of cups - and honestly I would have been fine if it didn't have one at all. The sound it emits on dry mode is not necessarily loud but it is high pitched and I don't like it, but if it's bothering me I can just turn it off and take them out to dry the old fashioned way. I have not tried any of the other modes.It comes with a pitcher (the tank takes about three pitchers to fill) and a basket to wash fruit with. The drainage hose is a little too long to sit the unit close to the sink but too short to really store it anywhere more convenient. Probably wouldn't be a problem if I could just leave the unit on my counter, but it will not fit under the cabinets so I got a rolling kitchen cart.Overall extremely satisfied and I can only hope it lasts!",

                "reviewText": "Was a little worried when I opened it up and inside the bag it was wrapped in it was wet. But I have used it 6 times since then and it works perfect. It's easy to use and everything comes out clean. I didn't have any issues with residue or buildup. Also, it's super quiet. Its quieter than my dehumidifier and my distiller. I don't even hear it unless I'm in front of it. I'm so glad I got this.",
