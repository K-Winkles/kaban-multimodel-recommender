                "reviewText": "I ordered this for a family member who has several people now living with her and uses a lot more silverware. My Mom said that she separated the basket into two parts and has the smaller one on the upper rack for tea spoons, with the other part on the lower rack. So far both baskets are working well in dishwasher with no issues.",

                "reviewText": "Even though the basket is nice, it does not fit in my Kenmore dishwasher. It's too square and the handle is too tall. It doesn't fit in the front or sides of the bottom rack, and it does not allow the dishwasher prongs to go up through the basket, making the basket too tall. I will keep it to use with my picnic table. I might try to drill holes in the bottom.",

This one will hold a lot of silverware and other small items, like plastic measuring cups, etc.It even matches the inside of my dishwasher, which is a Frigidaire. First pic is this one, second pic is the one that came with the dishwasher. Now if I have LOTS of dirty silverware, like on Thanksgiving, I can use both!",
