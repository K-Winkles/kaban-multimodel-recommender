                "reviewText": "These small baking sheets were exactly what I was looking for. Regular-sized cookie sheets or biscuit pans were too big for the small number of biscuits I make for my husband and me. I wanted something small enough to hold just 4-6 biscuits and these were perfect. Being made of stainless steel makes clean-up easy and they are maintaining their color and finish. So far I have used them multiple times and the max baking temperature I have used them at is 425\u00b0 with no warping noticed. These pans are quite sturdy and maintain their shape quite well. I do not forsee any problems with their ability to keep their shape. I am using them in a regular oven and am really pleased with this purchase. If I ever need more I will certainly purchase this product again. I may buy some more just to ahve them on hand!",

After you take the pan out and let it cool, it\u2019ll pop back into its original shape and be good as new.",

                "reviewText": "the 12\" pan was just the tiniest bit too big to fit onto my 13\" wide kitchen-aide toaster oven shelf. I mean, it can slide in, but it touches the edges, so no air would be able to circulate. Measurement seems to be of the bottom of the pan, which is 12\", top edge of lip flares out just a little bit putting it closer to 12.5\" which was a bit too snug for what I wanted.OTOH, these pans are the perfect size to proof 6 bagels in the fridge overnight and fit on my fridge shelves much better than trying to get a full sized pan maneuvered in there. I can't say how they react to heat as I bake my bagels on a pizza stone, but I've been hand washing and rack drying them weekly for a bit now and no signs of rust. Beautiful shine. Nice solid, heavy pan. No warping or flexing when cold.",
