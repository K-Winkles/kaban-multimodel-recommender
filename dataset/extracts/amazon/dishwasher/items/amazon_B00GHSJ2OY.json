A few extra parts that were not needed but nice to have for a future project.One star deduction for unclear wiring. The wire provided does not have your typical white, black green wire indicators of insulation to wire easily. The green wire was identified easily but the white/black wires took some digging to find out. The wire line with the indention on the side, it takes a keen eye to see, is the hot wire. Also, after looking carefully, looking at the three-prong plug, there was a 'w' which indicated white. I used these notifications as a guide to properly hook it up. Other than that, a great kit for the inexperienced dishwasher installer.",

                "reviewText": "EZ-Flow 48337 Dishwasher Installation Kit is hard to beat. All the parts I needed to wire and [supply] plumb my new dishwasher. There are a variety of plumbing adapters so the kit fits both those with a \"garden hose / washer\" style inlet, and also also fits 3/8\" compression style inlet. Typical stainless braid over the 6 ft hose. Note, the power cord has \"SPT-3 105C\u00b0 16AWGX3C\" embedded in the cord. Some reviews here were complaining that the wire gauge was inadequate for a dishwasher connection. My Fridigaire FFBD2412SS dishwasher specification document says its \"Total Amp Draw = 10.0\". And 16AWG wire is rated for up to 13 amps, so the ampacity of the included cord is perfectly adequate for this dishwasher. And vendor \"Faucets and Accesories\" shipped my order very quickly.",
