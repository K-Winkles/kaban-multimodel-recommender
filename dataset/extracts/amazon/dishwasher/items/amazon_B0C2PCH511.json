                "reviewText": "I have been looking for a dish rack as I moved to a new apartment. Upon searching, I came across this dish rack, which has two levels, and it is amazing. The dish rack came in nice and secure packaging. There are clear instructions on how to install it, which are simple to follow. Kitchen-wares that were washed are able to dry effectively, and all the water is collected at the bottom, making cleaning easy. Overall, highly recommended, A+++",

                "reviewText": "I've never had a dish drainer so clever. It's narrow, so it fits nicely on my counter. The draining trough extends so that you can back the dish drainer away from your sink and still drain water from your dishes. The knife and tableware holder is great for knives and holding those small things that always get lost before. The cup holder will not hold American size glasses and mugs, but it's useful for holding and protecting many other items - small plates, measuring cups and small jars. I've never loved a drainer before until now. Call me silly, but it's just that cleverly designed.",

This is the worst piece of junk I have ever purchased. Omg a dollar store drainer is better matter fact once I\u2019m done writing this review dollar general here I come. I can\u2019t trust anyone on Amazon bc everyone is bought and paid for. This thing is to small. It holds water at the bottom. It slides around and it\u2019s just absolutely horrible. Nothing fits at the bottom. If you\u2019re single with one set of dishes maybe. Don\u2019t make a dinner party that requires more than one pot or pan to be washed. Good luck on this. Biggest waste of money ever!",
