It was a bit heart-pain to run dishwasher on HIGH-HEAT/max-clean mode when EMPTY and some more you need to put this cleaner product that you paid good money for to literally pour it down the drain. Never mind, just press start and watch my k-drama. After 1 (I think more like 3) episodes, my dishwasher really really smell so clean that I didn't want to load it with dirty dishes lor! Got new dishwasher smell and feel! Will buy and treat my dishwasher to de-toxing when this item goes on sale again!",
