                "reviewText": "My first experience with a dishwasher pump filter came in 2019 when my Maytag dishwasher started leaving too much food residue on the dishes. When I consulted the manual, I learned the pump filter must be cleaned periodically. I didn\u2019t even know what a pump filter was, or that a dishwasher had them. The pump filter in my dishwasher was a filthy mess, so I ordered a replacement Whirlpool filter through Amazon. (Whirlpool made Maytag, which the manufacturer later discontinued.) Fast forward to 2023, and I now have a newer Amana dishwasher that uses the same filter. Although I cleaned the filter on the new dishwasher as needed, I recognized the value of having a spare or replacement available. So, I ordered the Binazon replacement filter. It has been working flawlessly for the last month.Appliance and equipment manufacturers have long insisted that you order only \u201cauthentic\u201d replacement parts. But many people now realize that generic replacements often do as good a job at a much lower price. The Whirlpool pump filter prevents food residue from going down the drain and clogging the internal plumbing (or being splashed back onto the dishes). It\u2019s a cylindrical tube with a mesh coating that fits snugly, but not too tightly, into a hole at the bottom of the dishwasher. Give it a turn, and it locks into place. Turn it the other way, and you can pull it out for cleaning.The Binazon filter replaces the filters in a wide variety of Whirlpool, Amana, Kenmore, and KitchenAid dishwashers. (The latter three brands are all manufactured by Whirlpool.) When I compared the replacement Binazon filter to the original Whirlpool one, they seemed almost identical to the naked eye.The mesh filter on the Binazon filter felt the same as the original Whirlpool filter. The only difference between the two was some small print on the plastic top of the Whirlpool filter. That print showed which direction to turn the filter to lock or unlock it. The Binazon filter had no similar writing. However, installing or replacing the Binazon filter is relatively intuitive, even without the printed guidance. I\u2019ve had the Binazon filter in place for about a month. The dishes are clean, and the filter shows no wear or damage. The dishwasher sounds the same when it\u2019s running.Writing a review for a dishwasher is easy. There are many things, good or bad, to note. Writing a review for a single replacement component part is not. All I can do is try to find differences in appearance and performance. The only one I found was the absence of some non-essential guidance printing from the original filter. The Binazon filter does everything the original Whirlpool filter does (I still have both in good condition for performance comparisons) at a cost and convenience savings. You won\u2019t go wrong ordering this replacement part for your Whirlpool-manufactured dishwasher.NOTE: I received this product as part of the Amazon Vine program. However, the contents of this review are entirely my own.",

                "reviewText": "This filter is the EXACT same as my stock original filter. I have a Kenmore Elite but not sure of the model number. I simply wanted two in case one breaks and to have a clean one ready to go until I clean the other one.It is a process to clean this filter. I use a sponge with scrubbing material on one side. Your standard kitchen sink type of two-sided sponge. I am tempted to get an old toothbrush to use as well. There are a lot of surfaces to this filter that collect debris. That makes it difficult to clean 100%. I am confident that a complete cleaning is not necessarily needed, but I try to get it spotless.I am always careful to not tear or rip the fine mesh of this filter. I have owned the dishwasher for many years and have never compromised the filter cartridge, but I am always careful when cleaning it. You would think that you could just run it through a cycle but then the other filter would collect what comes off of this one. So, I ran a wash without a filter, but I think that defeats the purpose of cleaning the dishes.The solution for me at least is to have another filter on hand to soak and thoroughly clean before I use it again. This eliminates any 'down time' between washing. This filter cartridge appears well made and sturdy. Identical to the original. And offered at a great price. Good product. Good value.",
