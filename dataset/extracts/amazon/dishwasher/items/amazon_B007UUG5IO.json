Not only is it planet friendly, non-toxic, and free of harsh scents, it works BEAUTIFULLY on my dishes. Better than all the name brands and top sellers. Seriously, it works in spectacular fashion. No spots, no food, no grease, no nothing left behind. I think it has also replaced my need for a rinse agent as well. Have not refilled rinse agent (even though my machine says it's time), glasses, etc...all come out clean w/o spots. I absolutely LOVE this product. Try it, you'll be surprised",
