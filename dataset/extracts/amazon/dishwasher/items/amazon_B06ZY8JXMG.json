                "reviewText": "I bought these knowing the concern about the residue being left behind. I live in Florida and the water here is pretty hard, so I figured there\u2019s a high risk it\u2019ll happen, so I only bought one bag.My suggestion to anyone who is struggling with the residue or is worried about the residue is to get rinse aid. I\u2019m not 100% sure if that\u2019s the solution, but I used the Seventh Generation Rinse Aid and my dishes came out clear. (I did a very small load to test before potentially ruining a whole wash by the way)Why go through the trouble, especially if you've never had to rinse aid before? My personal reason is that this is one of the few brands I know and love, because 1. It doesn\u2019t do any animal testing on any of their products 2. It\u2019s a more environmentally friendly company than the regular big corporation store brand. The first ingredients are far softer too, not jam packed with heavy duty chemicals, but just enough needed to get everything clean. I order everything cleaning from them, and try out different scents all the time. They\u2019re not overpowering but also not so diluted that you wonder why you bother getting scented in the first place.I can usually buy all their stuff in bulk (sets of 6 or 4) which saves on the amount of times I need to order in any given time frame.I love Method so I decided to try this out knowing the risk, and I\u2019m very relieved that this is another product of theirs that I can support and use.",

That means you need to use both dish detergent booster (I use Lemi-Shine brand) & rinse aid (I use 7th Generation brand) with these pods. Yes, that does make it more expensive, but unfortunately using natural substances costs more.I\u2019ve been happily using these Method pods (WITH the other products mentioned above) for years and have had no film, no spots, etc. Only time I got a film was when a guest \u201ckindly\u201d started my dishwasher without putting in the detergent booster & my rinse aid was low. I got the white film off my dishes & inside of dishwasher by running dishwasher with the booster & rinse aid. Can\u2019t remember if I put a soap pod in too, but I don\u2019t think so.I live in an area with hard water. When I got my new dishwasher 4 years ago, the installer told me to be sure to use both a booster (helps with hard water) and rinse aid. He was right!",

This one does a great job, virtually the same as the non-environmentally friendly products, but comes shipped in a zip lock bag that after repeated use does NOT stay completely closed and will allow moisture around the kitchen and sink areas to start causing the pods to have their dissolvable, protective skin-like coatings to start dissolving prematurely which is not supposed to happen till their exposed to hot water in the dishwasher. I suppose I can buy a clear plastic storage jar from Amazon, but just one more thing to have to worry about doing",

Idk what it is, but these dishwasher pods clean my dishes much better than the rest. I was currently using leading brand Finish, but yeah...no! Method is where it's at! It smells great; not overpoweing, the value is great and it just gives my dishwashing cycle an overall cleaner finish. No more residue left in the pod compartment or bottom of the washer.",

                "reviewText": "I am SO impressed! I love Method products, number one, because they are not tested on animals.But then there is performance! I ordered this in lieu of the product that I had been using, which was very good, but didnot get food off of dishes in the dishwasher. OK, I had a 20 year old dishwasher. But still. I got a new GE dishwasher, that I really love, but wasn't sureany dishwasher could get food off, and then finally decided to try. With these packets. I still get dried-on food off, I may test with that next.And I give the dishes a rinse, but some things like a glass that sat with lemonade or wine or a cup with yogurt residue or coffee andcream....ALL come magnificently clean!! And no rinsing agent needed! The manufacturer recommended a well-known brand of detergent and rinsing agent. All chemicals. All unnecessary.And most important to me, those brands are all (Ignorantly, Unnecessarily) tested on animals. Any chemicals they could possibly usehave already been tested. The companies know the results. Any further testing is just cruelty. See the NAVs website.",

I forgot to buy new box so I realized that we don't have any tablets too late. The ecover is unavailable on amazon and I had to order it elsewhere. Meanwhile I just got these as they were next day delivery and thanksgiving weekend was coming up. Well these are pretty terrible. Switching from one last tablet of ecover to method ones showed the huge difference. They left hard water scale stains. The texture on top of glass and ceramic is rough. They stained even stainless steel with maps of white residue. After just couple loads during thanksgiving, they are going back returned. I am eagerly waiting my ecover tablets now.",
