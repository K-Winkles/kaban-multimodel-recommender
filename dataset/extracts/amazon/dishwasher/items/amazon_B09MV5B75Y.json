                "reviewText": "The main thing I also like most about this is that: most dish washers need to be cleaned out regularly with a combination of vinegar and baking soda to remove the sulfate/byproduct of dishwasher detergent from the pipes. This bubbling tablet is basically baking soda with cleansers and deodorizers. So it serves several purposes to both declog the washer, clean it and deodorize it.I use it on hot cycle once a week and my dishwasher smells fresh and good as new. No embarrassing odors when guests arrive and offer to help with the dishes.I also love the convenience of it and that the tablet totally dissolves after the washing cycle.This is a must purchase for convenience, scent and no fuss declogging. I also have allergies and has to maintain a clean and hygienic home to stay on top off the allergens, I recently tried the active washing machine cleaner, and I am thoroughly impressed with the results. This product has become an essential part of my regular cleaning routine, and for good reason.One of the best things is the active washing machine cleaner effectively eliminates unpleasant odors and removes built-up residue from the interior drum of the washing machine. After using this cleaner, I noticed a significant improvement in the overall freshness of my laundry, as well as a reduction in musty odors that had been lingering in my machine.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this product right before EOY 2023 so I decided to wait until the new year before using. Based on Serial and Model # of my dishwasher it's about 6-6 1/2 years old. I've been in my house now for a little over 3 years. Where I live, and based on the gunk buildup on the shower head, we have somewhat hard water and there was a little bit of buildup (not very much, really) beginning in the dishwasher. So, enter this product. I've used it three times so far (1st of Jan, middle of Jan and now 1st of Feb) and the inside of my dishwasher is sparkling clean, like new!! And the aromatic fragrance is very pleasant. The only thing I do different from what the instructions say is after the process completes, I restart the dishwasher in Rinse mode only to make sure everything is rinsed out. I definitely recommend this product. Two Thumbs Up!!",
