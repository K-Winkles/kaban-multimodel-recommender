                "reviewText": "Purchased these Dish Wand Refill Non Scratch Replacement heads to replace the Scotch Brite Heads that leak dishwashing liquid as soon as the wand is filled. These are less expensive than the Scotch Brite & the Ledman brand. However they did not stand up to the test/expectation. The sponge did indeed leak liquid and was empty by the next day. The heavy duty sponge although appeared to be better than Scotch Brite, by end of the week the heavy duty portion was peeling/rolling off. They are not durable enough for daily dishwashing by hand. Each sponge was utilized down to the yellow sponge and will use them until no longer effective but these create unnecessary waste in length of use and leaking dishwashing liquid from washing your dinner dishes and gone by breakfast.",

First I will say, they fit more snug on the wand then the name brand that you are supposed to use and I thought that was great. Stayed in place and did not budge while I \"Hulked out\" on dishes! I am super hard on my sponges because I am an OCD clean Freak and have to ALWAYS press as hard as possible while scrubbing!! I noticed with my previous sponges by the 3rd use they would start ripping apart from the little plastic piece they are attached to and the sponge would start breaking off...BUT NOT THESE...I would have to say someone from the factory was sent to spy on me and watch how I destroy sponges and then came up with a game plan to design one that would actually work for this aggressive dish washer!! Kudos to the makers! I will buy these again!",
