                "reviewText": "PROS:DOES THE JOB - I use when dishwasher starts to smell in between washes - IT DOES keep it smelling fresh IN BETWEEN washes, with dirty dishes in it (I run dishwasher every other day)PRICE - OK, A LITTLE PRICIER than Walmart, but only by about a couple buck AND I can get it delivered free with Prime. I pay about six bucks and change at Walmart, I paid about eight and change here. Considering I am isolating, well worth the couple bucks to have delivered.LENGTH IT LASTS - Keeps my dishwasher smelling good for about THREE weeks, if I'm lucky. A little disappointed in longevity.CONS: SCENT is strong and I am sensitive to scent. But the strong scent starts to dissipate after a few washes. IF you are sensitive to scent, after you run the dishwasher with the pod in it, before you open the dishwasher, open some windows and take a deep breath, bolt out of the room and go to another room til it cools down. It also doesn't last as long as I would like, I need to use about every three weeks and I run dishwasher every other day and rinse dishes lightly before I put in dishwasher.",
