                "reviewText": "I bought this citric acid to see if it would clean my dishwasher after I installed a new filter once it arrive (filter happens to be on back order) My filter was clogged (soap scum, hard water etc. my whole dishwasher was gross and so were my dishes) and its not the manual clean ones, but ones that you have to replace every 6-12 months. Any way I decided to try cleaning the dishwasher with the citric acid and omg it didn't just clean my dishwasher , it removed all the particles and scum off of my filter. I tried doing some of my baked on hard water and soap scum dishes which came out amazing. I'm in love with this product, I will be using it in every load. :)",
