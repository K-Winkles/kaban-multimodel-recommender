Yes it is both energy and water efficient so only a gallon to a gallon and half of water is used for the entire cycle. Impressive how it and the Finish do such a phenomenal cleaning job together that never disappoints. True NO scrubbing or soaking! Everything comes out clean silverware and glassware do sparkle lol. Since my dishwasher does not have an actual enclosed dispenser compartment, I was a bit skeptical that the Finish would entirely dissolve and expected there may be some residual bits left inside machine, nope! Never been any issues at all with Finish well worth a few extra bucks for quality cleaning every time.",
