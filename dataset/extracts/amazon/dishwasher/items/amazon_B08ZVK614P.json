                "reviewText": "This review is going to cover a bunch of ground.History. About 15 years ago, i bought a compact dishwasher with a big brand name attached. it cost a lot.it's door latch gave out and had to be replaced so i went with an SPT. Having installed and then de-installed the brand name dishwasher, i noticed that, at half the price, the SPT had the exact - and I meanexact - inner workings as the brand name. That SPT lasted about 6 years and the door latch gave out again.The product itself was great but a titchy little connection in the door latch of both machines was the weakspot.So; to the present. New SPT came in, delivered perfectly, packed perfectly.Some enhancements to the previous model - hopefully, the new door latch system will last forever : )Installation for someone who has installed two of them already was pretty straightforward. (other thanthe fact that no installation like this is easy because bending supply lines and twisting wire nuts isalways a pain for - wait for it - a 73 year old )- The instruction manual is not good - verging on bad.. They need a good tech-writer to actually write a manual for novices if they want a novice to be able to tackle the job.If you are going to tackle this job on your own, spend a lot of time looking at the installation book, looking at the machine, making little progressive steps and then go back and try to figure out what the installation manual is trying to tell you. the instructions are the weak spot.I'm hoping the latch problem is fixed because this is a pretty good little dishwasher. And, as said,that old, big name, double price machine had exactly the same innards as this little guy.",

                "reviewText": "This is the only brand of dishwasher I trust after a traumatic history of dishwashers breaking for me. Came in pristine condition. We pack it full and it\u2019s a true hero in my kitchen.Edit to add: about a year later, it\u2019s still going strong. I just realized I am supposed to clean the drain of it and it was truly nasty in there after a year! But after some scrubbing and vinegar, it\u2019s good as new.",

I\u2019m far more concerned with the job it does. I cannot speak to longevity, that remains to be seen. Also for a small unit, it holds quite a bit of \u201ckitchen-ware\u201d. Easy installation for mildly handy folks.",
