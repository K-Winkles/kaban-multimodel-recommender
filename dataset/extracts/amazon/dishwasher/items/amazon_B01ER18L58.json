The non-stick coating is fantastic (granted I still add a little oil, but only a tiny bit is required).The handle length is great.As to size, note that the diameter of the pan is only 7.5 inches, which is my favorite size. I find that 8 inch fry/saut\u00e9 pans are a bit larger than I need.The bottom of the pan has a metallic layer, which enables fast heating and conduction (plus supports an induction stovetop\u2026which I don\u2019t have). It works great on my gas stove.This pan brings back the EASY in my Over Easy eggs!",

Well packed, delivery was fast. Good price.",

I now buy a new T-Fal every 3 years or so for top-notch non-stick performance. Nothing beats new, and just replacing my T-Fals after years of use is a fantastic experience and more cost-effective vs. paying hundreds of dollars for expensive sets that stop performing acceptably after a few years.",

Not where whatever you\u2019re frying is. Like really tiny. Good for one person breast. Not two. I am keeping it. There will be use for it and it\u2019s a joy to use.

Then you ask yourself why you didn't keep the old pan. But this pan has become our go-to for the smaller pan (it is not small by any means) uses like aiggs and sausage and potato sides and such. My friend says eggs like aiggs so aiggs it is. Anyway, this pan is absolutely magnificent quality, has a good stay-cool handle (and no water pouring from anywhere after removing from the dishwasher) and we are going to get another one. I must say I am not quite sure still what the center dot is for, though. It does not change as far as we can tell. But who cares - the pan is spot-on.",

I don't need to turn the heat up nearly as high, and even the most stubborn residue (like cooked on egg) glides off the pan without soap under the tap. It's also an awesome pan to use when cooking fish, as you don't need to use any oil and nothing ends up sticking.I usually throw everything in the dishwasher because I'm pretty lazy, but it's so easy to clean this pan that moving it to the dishwasher from the sink is more work than just a quick rinse and scrub.I'm also a big fan of the entirely metal design. I've found that plastic handles tend to get a little grimy after a few years of use and are a tad difficult to clean, but no issue with that here. I haven't noticed any issues with the handle getting too hot, and the ability to use this pan in the oven will bring some versatility to your kitchen toolbox.I'm exceedingly impressed with this pan. I can't wait to collect every size.",
