                "reviewText": "I used these brackets to secure an older (Frigidaire) dishwasher to my kitchen cabinets after installing granite countertops. The Frigidaire dishwasher was an older model and as such was not fitted or designed in any way to be used with side mounting. The dishwasher had brackets welded to the top of an aluminum band which held the plastic dishwasher body to the metal dishwasher door frame. But I couldn't use these brackets since you cannot screw into granite without possible damaging it. However, even the aluminum band went around the dishwasher exterior. There was absolutely no where to \"hook\" a bracket (you also could not screw into the aluminum band because you might puncture the plastic dishwasher body which would cause leaks and trash your dishwasher). So I purchased these brackets and J-B Weld 8265S Original Cold-Weld Steel Reinforced Epoxy - 2 oz. I mixed the epoxy and put a healthy amount on that aluminum band which I described above. I then stuck these brackets in that epoxy and used blue painter's tape to hold the brackets in place. I let the epoxy fully cure (15-24 hours) and then I tested. SOLID HOLD. Just like a a steel weld. I pushed the dishwasher back in the cabinet and used 1/2 inch wood screws to secure to base cabinet frame. The other side was next to a sheetrocked wall so I used 4 inch screws and found a stud close-by and screwed the bracket directly into a stud. Mounting now is solid as a rock. Dishwasher does not move at all. Hope this helps. Good luck!",

It came with top mounting hardware as well, but I didn't use it due to my granite countertops. In order to trim these I used a Dremel with a cutting wheel to cut off the excess... but you could use a grinder or snips. I bent the back side of the bracket once installed so it would be tight, and made sure the sides flared outward on each side (opposites: one to left flared and one to right). Then I drilled a quarter inch hole so I could access the screw and started the screws with a screwdriver then finished them with the drill, but no pilot hole in the wood was required. 10/10",
