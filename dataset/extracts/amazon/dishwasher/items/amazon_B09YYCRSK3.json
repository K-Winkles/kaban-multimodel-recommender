            "Wash Wherever You Want: With a built-in 5L water tank, you can start washing dishes wherever is most convenient for you. Alternatively, hookup to a faucet (hose provided, adapter not included) for a direct water supply that makes filling the tank unnecessary.",

It's large enough to accommodate a wide range of dishes of all sizes, but small enough to go wherever you need.",
            "Extra Dry Dishes: Powerful heating elements vaporize moisture while automatic ventilation keeps your dishes clean, dry, and ready to use for up to 72 hours. Your health is our utmost priority, so we\u2019ve made sure that your portable dishwasher leaves dried dishes squeaky clean and warm to the touch \u2014 with no trace of detergent residue.",
            "Easy to Use: The tilted electronic touch control provides quick and convenient operation, while the transparent doors allow you to see the whole dishwashing process without opening the appliance. The rotating spray arms provide top-to-bottom, corner-to-corner coverage for thorough cleaning."

Gets dishes very clean (except for baked on crusty stuff, you have to scrape clean), has top and bottom spray arms, a fill hole at the top so no hassle trying to connect to faucet, a window, extra shelf space, pretty quiet when you line up the dishes properly, great compact size (*be sure to measure space between counter and cabinets above if you have them ... this just barely fit underneath mine*). Got it on sale at a great price right before Christmas. Delivery was great and box in good shape (no damage). Overall, very pleased!",

                "reviewText": "I'm so tired of washing dishes and I have a small kitchen so I've been researching these bc I kept seeing people on tiktok that bought this one and loved it. So I took a chance and got one. Got it today used it once now I'm on a second load. It did a very good job on cleaning my dishes although I did rinse before putting them in also I learned off tiktok not to use the pods due to the residue that they would leave and to use a liquid detergent but not to fill it completely also bc of the residue and it worked perfectly no residue at all. It was very simple to set up also. The drying part not so good, I mean it does dry but not completely. That's not an issue for me though. I would absolutely recommend this and am so glad I purchased it as long as it keeps working like it did today and doesn't give me any problems.",

My only gripe is that if you load it too full and the door doesn't shut completely, there's no stop function and water will splash out. I still think it's worth the value and use it almost every day.",

We have tried it for several months with 2 washings a day. There are no issues & the dishes come out clean on every cycle selection. Revised the rating to 5/5. Its a perfect size for 2 people, & very energy efficient.Update: the seller contacted me & offered a refund or another dishwasher. Because it was so amazing & got such good reviews, I opted to have them send me another one. Electronics can fail so, I am hopeful that the new one will clean just as well & not have any issues. I will update the rating when I receive the new product & try it. If it works reliably then I would change the rating to 4/5 stars initially & if it lasts at least a year I would give it 5/5.We really enjoyed the product while it was working. 10/10It stopped working. I followed all the manufacturers suggestions with no result & then contacted ecosy. No response. It is an expensive item that broke when it is past its return date. As near as I can tell the pump needs to be replaced. We were hoping the manufacturer would have a warranty for this item & either exchange it or send a replacement pump. It is too expensive to buy & have last 3 months.",

                "reviewText": "So, just to preface for the folks who are looking for a review from a similar lived experience: early 30s here, bachelor, lives in a fine downtown urban apartment but lacks dishwasher, had been manually doing dishes by hand for almost 4 years.This thing is outstanding. For starters, its practically plug and play. Aside from making sure the drainage tube is secure and facing a bucket properly, this thing pretty much was ready to go from unboxing. Not a whole lot of thinking required for that part (cut the protective tape, of course, but that actually is more than you'd think). If you're like me and you've had a dishwasher before then went an extended time without it, this will feel like meeting an old friend. It won't matter that it takes a couple trips to the sink to get the water up to the level it needs to start a cycle, you will GLADLY take that over those days you kicked the dishes to the next day until it became a beheomoth and you took an hour just to clean them so you could keep your sanity. It will take you 3 minutes, tops, to fill the unit with enough water. Then, press a button and its just like having a normal washer and dryer. The water drains pretty cleanly and with good pressure. Just make sure its secure when it starts. Mine needed a bit more reinforcement the first go-round and did spray a bit, but I caught it early and should be fine moving forward.Look, just buy it. I was looking for the best value - cheapest that wouldn't need to be replaced anytime soon and had sizable enough capacity to make doing a single person's dishes manually a thing of the past. I wanted something that could handle a few plates, a few cups, some silverware, a pan maybe and a couple bowls. I wanted to stop feeling like two uninterrupted meals in a day resulted in an unholy amount of dishes to be cleaned afterward. This machine did that. In one day.All it needed to do was prove 1) it worked like a normal dishwasher (cleaned with pressure, didn't require extra effort than would otherwise be needed on a normal dishwasher), 2) it could handle a couple meal's worth of dishes from a single person cooking at home and 3) it didn't increase my water or electricity bills. It checks all 3. When people say its a lifechanger, I mean it quite tangibly - after 4 years in the same apartment, I finally feel like my place is complete and Ive lived in a lot of places. With this small addition, I feel like I finally have the perfect place.",

I decided to get this since it has a tank so you don't need to run a water line to it. So far I am very happy with how good a job it does. It doesn't hold much, but for me that doesn't matter. I can do a couple plates, a few glasses and a couple sets of silverware. It's not good for large or odd shaped items, but I was able to wash my InstaPot, and even(barely) fit my 13-1/3 inch microwave carousel plate. So far I am very happy with all results. I am using the cheapest Costco dish soap pods. It is small and doesn't look bad sitting on the kitchen counter.",

My dishes get super clean, my sink stays dish free, and I get some peace of mind.The machine itself was very easy to set up and understand, it's quiet and effective. I still have to wash my pots and pans because the machine is too small for that, but it holds a surprising amount of dishes. It runs longer than some other dishwashers on the market and doesn't dry the dishes super well, but there is an extra dry function which helps with that, and as for the time it takes, I put my dishes on before I go to bed so I don't even worry about it.Overall this is the best purchase I've made and it is completely worth the money.",

Everything comes out sparkling clean...cleaner than doing by hand. I'm using the add water and drain into the sink option. I put a bread board over the hose to weigh it down when I run it which allows the suction cup to stay attached in the sink. I hate washing dishes and it always seems like the sink is full of dishes and the counter is taken up by the dish rack. Now the sink is empty, there's lots of space on the counter, the kitchen looks great and it saves me a lot of time. I wish I'd bought one sooner...makes cooking much nicer when you don't have a sink full of dishes to do when you're done. Very happy with this dishwasher and love that it's portable.",

                "reviewText": "ADDING on after a few weeks of use. The initial review still stands, but there is one downside that I hope the manufacturer will consider. The dish rack should have a more closely woven basket. Because the spaces on the dish rack construction are so wide apart, dishes obtrude below the basket. This causes the lower washer arm to get stuck, so that it does not rotate. The washer arm is very close to the bottom of the rack, so a bowl, plate, etc that obtrudes even 1/4\" below the rack is enough to cause blockage of the washer arm.I have resolved this by simply inserting a small baking rack, the type used to cool baked goods; the baking rack (sitting at the bottom of the dish rack) has a more closely-spaced metal grid than the dish rack. But this should be resolved at the factory, not in the home.Still, little machine works like a charm to clean dishes. ORIGINAL REVIEW:Arrived on time, 1-day delivery. Unboxing and set up are a breeze.I began to use it right away, chose the fill-up, not the tap connection method. The first load, all seemed to go well, but when I took the dishes out, they looked unwashed and were bone-dry. As if they had gone through a dryer, not a washer.Next try (and 3 different times, different cycles used) dishes come out beautifully clean every time, Quick (plastic containers), Eco (just-used dishes) , or Heavy (small pots) cycles. DO Rinse dishes before putting them into the dishwasher.Works like a charm, and at Boxing Day pricing, also a great deal for something that has immediately enhanced my quality of life.",
