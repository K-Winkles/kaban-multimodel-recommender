I searched online for fixes and found this one, watched some videos to make sure I could do the repair, and then ordered it. It wasn't the spring, rather the little nylon piece broke that attaches the spring and cable to the door. Worked like a champ. Hardest part was figuring out how to pull the dishwasher out a little bit so I could put this on (just a couple screws holding the dishwasher in place). So if your dishwasher door is flopping open and you have moderate DIY skills and motivation then this might be an easy win for you.",
