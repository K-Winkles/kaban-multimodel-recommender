                "reviewText": "Installed a pair yesterday after reviewing several YouTube videos to supplement sellers video.Removing and replacing two, took 30 minutes and required only a screwdriver and some pliers.The parts seem to be sturdy and fit into the Kitchenaid without any modification.A minor complaint: The kit does not include the adjuster protective housing which is made from the same aging plastic as the adjuster's themselves. So this leaves a weak point in the repair. The seller video doesn't cover this detail, and at first I thought they had left out some parts.PROS: Installation was pretty easy and nothing required modification. The parts fit nicely and did not interfere with the drawer mechanism as some review suggests they may.CONS: No instructions on how to adjust or level the completed repair. No replacement 'adjuster housing' is provided, so if that part is also defective, your repair will be in vain.We'll see how this holds up. The OEM parts began to fail after about 5 years as I recall.",

Time will tell on the quality but OEM part didnt last and I expect this will last at least as long or better.

                "reviewText": "The part is exactly the same as our Kitchenaid dishwasher part at a fraction of the cost. This rack adjuster arm breaks often unfortunately. Got tired of paying service calls to repairman exceeding $200 with the part after waiting a week. It was a breeze to order this on Amazon and it arrived the next day. We followed instructions from YouTube and replaced the part not saying it\u2019s fun but if you want a working dishwasher you can\u2019t beat this deal.",

                "reviewText": "The negative reviewers were correct, these are well made parts except the tabs that hold the rack to the slides are too thick. These tabs did not work on my dishwasher because they're too thick to fit into the slides. I had to take a dremel tool with a sanding drum and make them skinnier. Fortunately, it didn't take long and afterwards they fit perfectly. I bought them knowing this was possible problem because the parts get good reviews otherwise. Amazon also was the only seller who could have them at my door in two days. All in all, except for the one thing, these are a good value. Half the price of OEM.",

The OEM rack adjusters lasted about two years before both sides broke at the locating tabs and push button locks. I ordered two different replacements which only lasted about a month each. This product claims to be \"improved\", so lets hope that is correct. It has a long warranty, so I hope I don't need to use it. The parts were harder to install than the other replacements, so I am hoping that means better durability. The install is very difficult and not intuitive. Thanks for the posting of a \"how to\" video, which I would not have managed without. I will update if any changes to my review.",
