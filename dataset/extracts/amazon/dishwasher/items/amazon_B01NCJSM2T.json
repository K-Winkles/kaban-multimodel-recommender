I cut them open & squish them into a Tupperware container; mix up the dry & liquid & use like ONE HALF TEASPOON ONLY!!!! I saw a review that said NOT to put it in FIRST ... well, yah, I DO ANYWAY & still get soapy water to wash dishes even after that first little cycle of water comes into the base ... I'm thinking that's the heating part & when it starts to swing into motion, that is what dissolves the detergent & it goes to town. My dishes come out super clean & I like the combo detergent. I tried just powder --- ended up with water spots on everything. I washed a small pan from my toaster oven & it came out nasty; still useable, but maybe not made for dishwashers of this size. Now the quest is on to find detergent LIKE THIS in the little pods for little dishwashers. CASCADE ... are you up to the challenge? This is a great detergent & even though a messy process for now, it does a great job of cleaning.",
