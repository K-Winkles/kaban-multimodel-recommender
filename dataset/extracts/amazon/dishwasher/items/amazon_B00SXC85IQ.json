                "reviewText": "This product has been nothing short of lifechanging for me. The city I live in has horribly hard water, so bad that I would have to run dishes 2-3 times through the dishwasher to get them clean, hand scrubbing them each time to get the residue off only for them to still be dirty. Sometimes dishes would even come out dirtier than they went in. Not only that, but my dishwasher sucked at removing food, too. Utensils would come out with food stuck on them. Shaker bottles would come out smelling like they hadn't even been cleaned. I even through away a full set of 8 Blender Bottles thinking that they smelled bad because they were just getting old when really it was that my dishwasher was so clogged up with hard water buildup that it couldn't clean anything. Things got so bad that I dreaded cooking because it meant I'd spend the rest of the week doing dishes. I started resorting to Uber Eats and fast food which was as bad for my health as it was for my wallet.At first I blamed it on the apartment I was living in at the time which was a bit older, thinking it was either the pipes or the older appliances. But then I moved into a new apartment that was only a few years old and had the same problem. For a long time I felt hopeless about the situation, but then I found these tablets.The results were mindblowing. I didn't even realize that the heating element in my dishwasher was supposed to be BLACK and not white until I ran a couple of these through it and realized it was just covered in lime deposits (see image). My shaker bottles don't smell funny anymore. My drinking glasses come out with no white rings on the bottom and once again look clean enough to drink from. Dishes don't have to be scrubbed for hours by hand. I no longer have to check every single utensil to make sure there isn't food stuck to it before I put it away. I'm able to go back to cooking healthy meals for myself without having to spend the entire week slaving away in the kitchen to clean up afterward.I was hoping that the effects would be longer lasting, but unfortunately it only took about 2 cycles without these tablets for things to go back to how they were (the \"before\" picture is actually AFTER I had gone through about 4 tablets, but then stopped using them for a couple cycles)\u2014that's just how hard the water is here :( I imagine most people won't have that problem and can just use these for maintenance, but I basically have to run one of these tablets with every single load. However, it is ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT to have clean dishes again and I will continue buying this product for as long as I live in this city or any other that has hard water.If you have hard water and you feel like your dishwasher isn't doing its job, I can't recommend enough that you give these a shot.",

I didn't even see that insert until after I'd used it the first time. Luckily, there was absolutely no explosive reaction and my eyes were just fine. It was very uneventful. But the insert really scared me. I decided to hide this up high, where even my teens can't find it. I don't want anyone using this and getting hurt.",
