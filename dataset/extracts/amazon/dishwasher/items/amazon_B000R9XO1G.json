The excitement grew when I realized it was my new dishwasher basket, bought especially for washing my reusable k-cups. You got me! I care about the environment. Anyways, for about two months, all was swell. But cut to me today. Not six months out from buying this product realizing that i now have to throw it in the garbage because the plastic has pulled away from the metal frame and has rusted. This product is garbage. Have a nice day.",
