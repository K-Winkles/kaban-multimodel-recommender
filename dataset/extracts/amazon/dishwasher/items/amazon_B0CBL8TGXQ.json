                "reviewText": "These work better than the other options from Finish. Even better than other leading brands when it comes to getting dishes clean and not leaving spots. The dishes with these pods come out clean, shiny and no spots. I didn't need to add extra rinse agents. I have hard water so always adding Lemon Shine and still spots. Thought I would try these since they were advertised for use with older dishwashers and thought maybe it would work better with my portable dishwasher. Not that it was old just felt maybe the pressure of water was lower than a cabinet dishwasher. AMAZING! 1 hour wash cycle and dishes, glassware and silverware came out shiny and clean. Love this product!",

There are no streaks and food is washed away. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a combo of the finish and new washer. The best part for me is the reduced scent. The other brand we used had a strong scent that I never understood. My dished should smell like nothing when they\u2019re clean and that\u2019s what I get with finish. If you like lemon scented dishes this isn\u2019t for you\u2026 if you like unscented dishes, this may be a game changer like it was for me.",

                "reviewText": "I was skeptical of buying the more expensive dishwashing tablets, but these two seem to work the best of anything we have used over the past several years. They certainly clean better than any of the liquids we've used, and better than any of the other brands of tablets. We have two teenagers who eat a lot and we are constantly running our dishwasher, and these have never let us down.Everything comes out clean, with no scale or residue ever.",

                "reviewText": "When this stuff is on sale, I buy it. Not necessarily because it cleans any better than the OG power all tabs, but because the gel packs are so much easier to work with over the Finish powdered tabs that come in the foil wrap. Nope, these little packs are grab, load and go\u2026 no unwrapping, no crumbling bits falling out, and of course, the dishes come out clean. Cleaner than the cheaper pressed powder tabs?? Not that I can see, but the convenience of it alone makes it a preferred choice.",
