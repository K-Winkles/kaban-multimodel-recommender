My budget said \"buy bigger for less!\" So ordered this gel to try. It's awesome! My dishes are cleaner using this gel vs using tablets. This detergent has a fragrance to it so when the dishwasher runs, I can smell the clean scent but when I drink water out of my glasses that were washed using this gel, there's no taste of it. Rinses away really well. I'll buy this again for sure! Much more affordable than the \"convenient\" tabs.",
