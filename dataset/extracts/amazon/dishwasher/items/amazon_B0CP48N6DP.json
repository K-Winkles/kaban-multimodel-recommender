                "reviewText": "This is a great1 liter water bottle. Both the bottle and the top are made of stainless steel, as is the handy wire bale that acts as a handle for the unit. There is a bamboo wood decorative plug glued to the steel lid; it seems pretty tough. The advantage of this bottle over some others is that the bare steel allows you to stick it in a fire for boiling water or putting it in the ashes to keep the water from freezing in cold weather. The bottle is uninsulated, so it will not keep liquids hot or cold, and it will \"sweat\" in warm weather if you put ice into the bottle; the opening is wide enough to do this. One unexpectedly good feature of this water bottle is the packaging. The box is obviously recycled material, and Bambaw claims that the item is made sustainably in the PRC, along with some \"zero waste\" stickers. This is a plus on an already great product. I am quite impressed. --Ed",

                "reviewText": "Un prodotto meraviglioso per tenere al fresco o caldo le proprie bibite. La uso quando devo uscire a farmi una camminata dove mi porto una tisana calda da bere al parco. Il prezzo \u00e8 molto bene, consiglio di lavarla ogni giorno perch\u00e8 dopo averla utilizzata.Insieme all'acqua metto alcune volte anche minerali e vitamine come Magnesio, potassio e sodio. Alcune volte Vitamina. Prendersi cura di s\u00e9 stessi \u00e8 fondamentale, per questo oltre ad idratarsi consiglio di prendere vitamine, per me il magnesio \u00e8 stata la svolta. Assolutamente.Per guarire da qualsiasi trauma o situazione bisogna lavorare sul proprio sistema immunitario e sistema nervoso. per questo camminare molto aiuta oltre alla scrittura. La scrittura aiuta a liberarsi dalle energie e pensieri negativi. Ogni volta che vi sentite negative riempite la borraccia e uscite a camminare. la vostra mente si svuoter\u00e0 e tornerete spensierati. Ovviamente ci sono alcune cose che si possono fare per guarire.Per ogni percorso di guarigione bisogna lavorare anche sulle proprie emozioni. La' fuori ci sono un sacco di video e libri che possono aiutarvi a farlo. Soprattutto in inglese. Un libro che a me ha aiutato molto \u00e8 stato questo: \"Andr\u00e0 tutto bene te lo giuro\" di Faouzi Zouhair. E' un libro suddiviso in riflessioni di argomenti vari tra cui Amore, amicizia, guarigione, libert\u00e0, soldi, depressione ecc. \u00e8 un libro che libera tutti i nodi emozionali. Lo consiglio a chi vuole lavorare su s\u00e9 stesso e guarire da ogni trauma del passato, non \u00e8 facile ma \u00e8 un percorso davvero liberatorio e che pu\u00f2 aiuta anche le relazioni.Detto questo consiglio questa borraccia perch\u00e9 dopo un anno la utilizzo tutt'ora durante i miei viaggi. \ud83c\udf43\ud83c\udf42\ud83c\udf43\ud83c\udf42",
