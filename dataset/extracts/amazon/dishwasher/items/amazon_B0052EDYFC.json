                "reviewText": "The idiots I bought my house from (low-cost flipper dippers) did not secure the dishwasher correctly. I have granite countertops, and instead of securing the sides to the wood cabinets, the flipper dipper morons laid a bunch of silicone caulk on the underside of the granite and \"screwed\" the top bracket into that. Who'd have thunk that anyone was that stupid? Lo and behold, 3 years later, my dishwasher \"fell out\" of the spot it was in because constant use essentially \"vibrated\" the screws out of the caulk. As I didn't have the side-brackets, and was at a loss of how to secure the dishwasher in its spot, I found this granite countertop kit -- best solution I've researched. After stripping the underside of caulk, and cleaning the granite with acetone, then alcohol, and waiting for it to dry, I affixed the original under-cabinet brackets to the top of the dishwasher and use this kit per the instructions and * voila *, problem solved. So far, great solution - 5 stars for now. I do have a WARNING for anyone who buys this - make sure you line up everything correctly and be very patient when moving the dishwasher into position BEFORE applying the adhesive side to the countertop. I was impatient and my installation is crooked. Otherwise, an elegant solution to a simple problem.19Jun21: One of the mounts had its adhesive fail and it fell off. It\u2019s on the rough underside of granite, and I thought it was supposed to bond. It didn\u2019t. Oh well. Have to find another solution. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE - Not even two months since installing this product and one of the mounts has come loose and the metal bracket damaged the dishwasher door when it was opened. Now I have to find another way to fasten my dishwasher to granite, plus I have to figure out what parts to replace on the door. I spent hard-earned money on this adhesive kit, but have found it to be WORTHLESS! Please save your money and avoid this product. I fell for it, but you don't have to! [Updated update - The top part of the dishwasher door cost $78. Would be much more if I didn't do it myself.]Original - review: After having our granite countertops recently installed I realized that no one had mentioned reattaching the dishwasher mounting screws. I thought about trying to find small masonry screws and drilling holes, but I happened to see this product at Lowes. I ordered it from Amazon because I thought it might be cheaper than the $12.99 price at Lowes...it wasn't. Anyway, it appears to have worked. The instructions say to clamp it for only 5 minutes, but I used my own clamps and small pieces of wood and left it clamped for about an hour before removing. One thing to keep in mind is that the included screws are very small and if they fell while trying to install, finding them in the bottom of the dishwasher would be extremely difficult, so I spread out a beach towel from the upper dishwasher tray down across the open door, so that any dropped screws would be caught and not lost forever. Of course after doing that I didn't drop either of them, but it was quick and easy insurance. It looks good so far and seems to be holding.",
