                "reviewText": "[Updated 12/10/16: New home, a new cat, and ~10 months going by means I feel the need to add some info in here. You can find that at the bottom.]My cats are in love! They both love eating from the dish. I was looking for a wide, shallow bowl that wouldn't hit their whiskers when they tried to eat. (My cats are among the many who are sensitive and won't eat from a dish that their whiskers touch. If you'd like more info, Google \"whisker fatigue.\") I also wanted it to be small so that the food wouldn't get old. With bigger bowls, I usually wind up tossing part of the dry food out since it gets old before they can eat it all. While I have to fill the bowls up quite often and some pet owners may find that irksome, I personally prefer it that way.I also bought PetRageous Oval Frisky Kitty Pet Bowl, 5.5-Inch, Black . I thought it'd be cute to have one white bowl and one black one, but for some reason, the cats refused to eat from the black one. I experimented with switching the placement of the bowls and so forth, but both of them still only ate from the white one. I wound up ordering another white one, and now they're perfectly content. (And spoiled. Both things.)One last possibly useful attribute: it says on the bottom that it's dishwasher safe. I don't have a dishwasher, so I can't test that claim, but if it's true, that's awesome.Attached are pictures to show what the bowl looks like with and without food, as well as a size comparison next to my cat Rootie. She's way more excited about the bowl than she looks, trust me.Bottom line: looks great, is sold for a fantastic price, and the cats love it. Highly recommend it!---Edited on 12/10/2016: It has been roughly ten months since I bought the first bowl. As I was only the foster home for my prior cats, I now have an entirely new one. That means I can give the opinions of three separate cats now (which obviously is super important because cats, that's why).Some other observations:1) Not only did the bowls survive two separate moves from city to city, but it took eight months and a direct fall onto the kitchen tile for one to break. Even then, it was a drop from high up and only the ears broke off. These things are incredibly durable.2) My (new) cat LOVES the black bowl I previously mentioned the other ones not liking. It seems that whether or not a cat will be bothered by the bowl color depends on the cat itself.3) Now that I have a dishwasher, I was able to test the claim over it being dishwasher-safe. The answer is a resounding yes. I do it all the time. There has been no harm to the bowl, so no worries there. (There is some color fading on the back, but I'm pretty sure that's because I wash it so much.)4) In my original review, I forgot to mention that it also says it is microwave-safe. That's come in handy lately as well.To state the obvious, I still highly recommend these bowls. If anything, I do so even more now that I'm aware of their sturdiness. Seeing as three out of three cat experts prefer these bowls over all others, it seems I am stuck buying the dishes forever. Luckily, I'm good with that. :)(I'm adding two pictures in addition to the others from before. The first is simply the back of the bowl, so you can see both what it says and also the minor discoloration I'm talking about. The second picture is my new cat with the bowl as she sniffs it out and silently judges me for the lack of food in it. That one is so you can see the color hasn't faded despite the time that's passed, as well as to give a little more size proportion since she is a bit larger than the foster cat in the other picture.)",

I needed something I would be able to pop in the microwave to warm up his food, then toss in the dishwasher for an easy clean up. These little bowls are perfect!!! They do everything I need, are cute and have lasted through many microwave heat ups and dishwasher clean ups and still look great. Even though they are meant for cats, I don't think my dog minds a bit.",
