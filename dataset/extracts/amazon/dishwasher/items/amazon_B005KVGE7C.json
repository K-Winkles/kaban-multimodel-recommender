I've used other brands of non toxic dishwasher detergents that didn't seem to clean as well as this.However - my last order - the pods are ill formed (like they were wet or had a big weight on them) and the dispenser in the dishwasher won't open, leaving dishes unclean. I'd had to manipulate and sometimes open the pods to get the detergent out and put it in the dispenser. I had to throw away a few and these are not inexpensive. I may go back to liquid. When it works it works well though.",

I love the hint of a fresh, clean scent, especially since I know it's not toxic chemicals!!",
