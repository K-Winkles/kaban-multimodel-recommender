It taints food and is just gross. NOT EVERYTHING HAS TO SMELL LIKE SOMETHING. SCENTED \u2260 CLEANThese have solved that issue. They clean just as well as the platinum packs and don't leave my silicone utensils with fake lemon concentrate embedded in them. I wish they were actually completely unscented, but at least the scent that is included is just lemon extract and fades away quickly enough",

                "reviewText": "Highly recommend switching to this from regular Cascade. We've been using Cascade pods for many years and were never bothered by it because the cleaning power is great, but once we had a baby and started washing silicon plates and cups in the dishwasher, we noticed it'd always leave a chemical scent that would not come off (tried boiling it in hot water, hand washing etc. but nothing worked so eventually decided to throw items out). Granted, silicon products retain smells we found out, but it made us wonder if there was another product out there that would work better and be safer. We tried other \"free and clear\" brands such as Seventh Generation, but those simply didn't clean our dishes well. This one cleans it really well and does not leave any strong scent on dishes.",
