Dishwasher detergent leaves a powder residue on dishwasher (see white substance on side of dishwasher rack in 1st photo) and on bottoms of bowls and glasses (see white ring from bowl in my cabinet in 2nd photo). It also does not clean the dishes thoroughly. We used Trader Joe\u2019s powder detergent prior to this purchase, and it worked great. Unfortunately, it was discontinued. I contacted Biokleen customer service by email. The rep requested my order number, but she claimed that she could not find my order number. She requested a screenshot of my order, as well as other information. She never provided me with answers to my questions or any helpful hints b/c she claimed that she could not find my order. Poor product and poor customer service!",

Honestly much better than I expected and maybe even better than my go to cascade platinum pods! My dishes came out clean without any residue at all anywhere!However I will say that it\u2019s not as easy as throwing a pod in there. First there is not scoop that I could find anywhere, and I dug through the container. There also wasn\u2019t one in the second container, which I\u2019m really surprised by. I don\u2019t think I have ever had a powder product not come with a cheap little plastic measuring spoon! It\u2019s also more of a process to find a tablespoon measuring spoon, open the bottle, scoop out the power, and try not to spill it and drop it while your carrying it and filling the slot up. No, it\u2019s not the end of the world. But they could have included a scoop to make that easier! Overall though I\u2019m really happy with the results!",
