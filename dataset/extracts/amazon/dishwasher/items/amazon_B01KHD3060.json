We were completely out of detergent and I was at Whole Foods, didn't want to make an extra trip to Safeway, so I decided to give this a try. My husband and I were shocked to find it cleaned as well, if not better than, Cascade.

                "reviewText": "We have very hard well water (18 grains). Other detergents like Finish Powerballs, Cascade gel, and Lemishine leave our dishes filmy after one wash. The Seventh Generation Dishwasher Gel Lemon is the only detergent we have found that reliably cleans our dishes as well as is they had been washed and dried by hand. Rinse aid isn\u2019t even needed. I normally drive 30 minutes to a store that carries it and am glad to be able to order it on amazon.",

I tried to get away with using the lowest level with this product, but it failed to clean the dishes well. I was forced to use the max level.
