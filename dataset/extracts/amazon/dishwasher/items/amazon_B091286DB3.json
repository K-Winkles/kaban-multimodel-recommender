                "reviewText": "I was so happy with this purchase of cutting boards. They shipped quickly and were packed securely. What I love is that they have substantial weight and are skidproof on both sides. On the larger two they have an area that you can grate garlic, etc. Also, they are attractive, I hung them on the wall. And, with the groove it catches all the juice when slicing. Great price and love the product.",
