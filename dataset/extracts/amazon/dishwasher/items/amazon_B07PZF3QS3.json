The shears are sharp, and can handle medium duty cutting. I love that the sheath clicks on snugly so it stays on even after being knocked around inside the kitchen drawer. I wash them in the dishwasher in the open position careful point it away from me so I can retrieve it safely. So far no signs of rust, and the joint has yet to loosen up, 2 things cheaper scissors always seem to do.",

The only difference between these and the other \"fancy\" ones, is that these don't come apart for washing. But other than that they are just as sturdy and cut through everything.",
