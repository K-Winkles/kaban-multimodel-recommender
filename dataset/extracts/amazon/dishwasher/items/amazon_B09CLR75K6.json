Who needs fancy brands?In the thrilling saga of finding bang-for-your-buck household products, Amazon Basics stands out like a superhero in a world of overpriced caped crusaders. Their dishwasher detergent pods are the latest in my lineup of affordable, quality finds. \"Fresh scent\"? Please, it's like worrying about the brand of air we breathe \u2013 totally irrelevant. I barely notice it, and that's the beauty of it.These pods are the epitome of convenience. Forget about the days of wrestling with packaging or measuring out liquid or powder. It's like playing a game of dishwasher basketball \u2013 just shoot a pod straight into the dishwasher's belly. No need for the fancy footwork of placing it in the dispenser.And let's talk about their stick-to-itiveness, or lack thereof \u2013 these pods don't clump together like a group of awkward teenagers at a dance. They dissolve like a dream, leaving no trace but cleanliness. Plus, they're like a gentle giant to your septic system.The result? Sparkling dishes and pots, no residue in sight. It's a dishwasher detergent that does its job without the fuss and feathers of a name brand. In a world where we're often dazzled by labels, Amazon Basics reminds us that sometimes, the real treasure lies in simplicity and efficiency.",

                "reviewText": "Why pay for a name brand? I love Amazon Basics. In almost every case, Amazon Basics delivers quality at a bargain price. This dishwasher detergent is no exception. The \"fresh scent\" is of no concern. Frankly I don't even notice - who cares, right? These pods are convenient - no unwrapping or pouring - you just toss one in. I don't bother even putting it in the dispenser. I just toss it in the bottom of the dishwasher. They don't stick together in the container, they fully dissolve during the cycle, they are septic system safe, they get your dishes/pot & pans clean. What's not to love.",
