Advanced cleaning done right the first time, even in hard water, when used with your favorite detergent. Our plant-powered, mineral-enriched Booster formula blasts away 24-hour stuck on food - no pre rinse needed. And with an EPA Safer Choice Certified Product that uses biodegradable dish soap ingredients you can feel good about, we're cleaning up dishes one load at a time. For more than 30 years, Seventh Generation has been thoughtfully formulating safe and effective plant-based products that work. Really well. Our dishwashing detergents and boosters use powerful plant-based ingredients like surfactants and enzymes to break down tough residue and lift away food, leaving your dishes sparkling clean. So, how does it all work? The enzymes cut through grease and food by breaking down starch and protein-based residue, while the surfactants remove dirt and grease by holding the molecules in suspension, so they can wash away. Yes, even those fussy egg stains. Based in Vermont, Seventh Generation is proud to be a Certified B Corporation. B Corps are certified to be better for workers, better for communities, and better for the environment.",

                "reviewText": "I've used regular dishwasher pods and my dishes were always coming out with Grease and stuck on food. I felt I just needed a appliance upgrade, my dishwasher is Over 10 years old. For the price thought I'd give this a shot. My dishes came out very clean, greasy dishes came out spotless. I was very surprised . I used to run the washer 2 times before getting any real results and this changed my mind about upgraded. Def recommend and my dishwasher also came out clean. Very happy customer.",
