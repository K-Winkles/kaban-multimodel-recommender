I can fit pretty much everything I use in it, and 3 people live in my house. Except pots of course, but it really does take the hassle off of your hands. It's easy to work, and set up. I've read reviews where people say that it is really loud, but I don't think so. It is quieter than your average dishwasher to me. Over all i am extremely impressed, and if you thought about getting one..YOU SHOULD :)",

There's a ton of tips and tricks and set up in it for your needs. Very very helpful.Will it be a replacement for a large family? No. Will it replace the handwriting of bigger items? No. However this is perfect for plates bowls cups silverware exc. I run it a couple times a week and it's great. Barely and electricity is used. Highly recommend if you hate handwriting everything.",

                "reviewText": "The excellent: It does a great job, and it's a nice (small) size, and I like that it doesn't need to be hooked up to a tap. It's also easy to use. The fact that it only uses 1.3 gallons (5L) per wash is also great.Could be improved a little: The instructions say to leave it slightly open between uses to dry, but the door doesn't have a slightly open position like a bigger model. It's either closed or fully open.REALLY needs improvement: The user manual is in serious need of updating and testing. The not-so-good part: There are two connectors on the back of the unit. One is where you connect the DRAIN hose, and it states to remove the black plug before doing so. Great. BUT, it doesn't explain what to do with the white/clear plug on the INTAKE connector on the back of the unit if you are NOT hooking it up to your tap and plan to manually add water via the opening on the top (answer: you leave the plug in place, and only remove it if you plan to connect the hoses to a tap). But the REALLY bad: the unit ships with Finish rinse aid samples, there's a sticker on the unit itself suggesting the use of Finish, but the instructions say NOT TO USE RINSE AIDS (and there's no reservoir for the rinse aid in the unit, so that makes sense). It's kind of nuts to tell you not to use a product, then recommend its use via samples and a sticker on the unit itself. I can't be sure, but this feels like a \"left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing\" situation.Now, all that said, customer service was excellent and helped me sort out both issues (and no, you shouldn't use the rinse aid).",

                "reviewText": "This counter top dishwasher is fantastic! It\u2019s compact, cleans unbelievable, it\u2019s quiet, was inexpensive compared to the large portable dishwashers I\u2019ve purchased previously.It was very easy to set up. I don\u2019t hook it up to the faucet. I find it easier to just add the water to the tank and place the hose in my sink.So far I\u2019m thrilled with it. I\u2019m hoping it lasts more than a couple of years which seems to be the timeline for my other large portable dishwashers.I listened to the reviewer that also recommended this item. I clean the filters after every use and use the Finish dishwasher pods-I\u2019m leery of using anything else with my track record of portable dishwasher breakdowns.My only complaint is that the manufacturer included a powder dishwasher cleaner which I did not like but it came with the dishwasher so I didn\u2019t care when I threw it out.I would highly recommend this dishwasher for those with limited space, limited budget and want a product that is very efficient and easy to use. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would!!Hopefully, I will be as pleased with my dishwasher 2 years from now as I am now.",

                "reviewText": "I had really high hopes for this dishwasher but after having it for 2 months I unfortunately have come to the conclusion that this was not worth the money.I live in a very small studio and was excited for a bigger portable dishwasher after my farberware dishwasher stopped working.Nothing on the top rack gets properly cleaned and I more often that not have to run a cycle at least twice to get anything overall cleaned. Using different detergents made no difference I think the jets must be very very weak. At this point I expect to still have to clean my dishes a little before they can actually be set to dry.Speaking of drying\u2026 I thought it wouldn\u2019t be too big a deal to have things solely air drying but with the price point I think having a drying function should\u2019ve been included. It\u2019s certainly a feature that I miss from my other dishwasher.So far I just set everything to the hygiene cycle in the hopes the high temps will get things properly cleaned but even with that setting things aren\u2019t coming out as clean as dishwashers in the past have gotten my dishes. This cycle makes the dishes dry faster is the only other upside.I think it\u2019s overall a good concept but needs significant improvement. I\u2019d urge anyone interested to look elsewhere.***UPDATE***After over 6 months of use and attempts to salvage this thing I think I\u2019m ready to give up and throw this thing in the trash.This thing now leaks and I\u2019ve had to put towels under it whenever in use. The water hose that\u2019s supposed to take in water is constantly falling out. I also had to get a different bucket to hold the water it would intake because the one they give you you basically have to fill it to the very top where it\u2019s close to spilling and even then it\u2019s not always enough.I\u2019ve had to do other things in attempts to work with the machine that I won\u2019t go into detail because it\u2019s ridiculous.This thing was supposed to make my life easier and it\u2019s honestly made things harder. I\u2019ll happily hand wash until I can save up to buy something, anything better.",
