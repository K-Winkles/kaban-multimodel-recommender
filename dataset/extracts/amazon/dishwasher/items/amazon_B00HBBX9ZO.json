But it is the best dishwasher \"soap\" I've used for glasses. I did NOT change my rinse agent & my glasses come out sparkling.It is getting more difficult to find it. I give JF Distributions an F for the way they packaged 2 boxes of If You Care Tablets. They put them in an envelope, which was NOT waterproof. Lucky it was not raining when the delivered it. It rained soon after. One of the boxes had broken open, so there were tablets all over the inside of the envelope. The first time I ordered this through Amazon, the seller packaged it in a box & everything was good. None of the tablets broke open, so I didn't lose product, but I am wary of ordering it ever again through Amazon. Don't know who will send it.",
