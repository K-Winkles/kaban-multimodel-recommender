However, the parts are cheap looking and the product doesn\u2019t even work. 1) Delivery: the package arrived carelessly in the hallway of the building, boxes all beaten up and doesn\u2019t even have the label Fragile. 2) There are plenty of dents and one is remarkably large. It must have been because the package wasn\u2019t even labeled Fragile. 3) Adapter to faucet is not working causing water flowing out when in use. I had to use my own faucet adapter. 4) Water pouring out the drainage hose when the machine in use, causing water damage to my floor. Again, it must have been because misalignment in the design of the parts. It has been a nightmare experience.",

Since it does not seem to be leaking I will not return it but for the price I expect better.In my 2 photos you can see it is just being unpacked. Still sitting on Styrofoam. The dents are worse than pictures show. Its hard to get a picture on the shiny black surface.",

                "reviewText": "I bought a countertop dishwasher against my better judgement. Repackaged and sent it back same day lol. I read all the reviews on this 18\" portable (rolling) dishwasher and was prepared for all possible disappointments. Like MANY reviews, the box was destroyed when it arrived. If I have to send it back I will need a new foam bottom. The female adapter broke while installing. I replaced the cheap, broken plastic with a new metal fitting and used a hose clamp for cheap, but should not have had to! They should send an extra hose system to each customer! Also, the plastic inside the back wall that positions the male adapter is very loose. I think it's missing a screw because that's is a tiny hole and i am 90% sure it's for a screw. The dishwasher cleans well, but heat dry is too short to dry the dishes. I did not use a rinse aid and I did not have spots on my silverware. I haven't washed glasses yet. It fits what we need as family of three with normal sized dinnerware and pots. No buying small dishes like people do for the countertop variety. I even got a stock pot in on the bottom with plates and the utensil basket \ud83d\ude00 I've only used it once, so time will tell. I will update in a while, after I have either fallen in love with it like I did my RCA portable clothes washer, or, when I've had enough of the troubles brought to my day by this nearly $600 machine.",

And they arranged to have the bad one picked up from my house at no charge. They even gave me a 100.00 rebate because the price dropped since I bought it. It is very small but holds all the dishes very compactly. I can hardly hear it run. My only gripe is that it takes 3 hours to run when I have it set on normal with heated dry and high heat. I haven't tried the other modes yet.",

I contacted Black & Decker 7 times in 3 months in hopes there was finally a tracking number, but was let down every time! Within the 1st month I contacted Amazon and they were great about it. They put notes in my account concerning the missing part and told me if it doesn't come, then I can return it. We'll I ended up returning a perfectly good dishwasher because the company wouldn't send a $5 part. On my last call to black & decker, I expressed my disappointment over this and the lady tried telling me I CANT return it because they won't let me. I told them it's already set up and it's not up to them. If you read reviews here and on other sites about this model, others had the exact issue so Instead I purchased the SPT dishwasher. It's the same setup but it came with the correct hook. Oh and the new dishwasher has a drying cycle unlike black & decker.",
