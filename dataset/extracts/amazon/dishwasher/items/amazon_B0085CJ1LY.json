                "reviewText": "Works great, doesn\u2019t leave any white residue, which is why I purchased it. I have tried finish, and cascade 3 in 1 and both have left white residue on my dishes, I used hard water booster, and the jet dry (or equivalent) and still had it. I use the big bottles of gel stuff, but tired of messy caps, and heavy bottles. Or not being able to find them, or get a good deal without buying in bulk or at sams club or BJ\u2019s.. I also hate wasting so much of it in the bottom of the bottle because I have no patience to wait for it to make it out of a huge bottle\u2026 or shake the heck out of it\u2026 so these were a perfect option!!!!They do everything that the liquid gel bottles do without the waste, I can find them on sale, and they are much cleaner and easier to use. And when my osteoarthritis or my psoriatic arthritis kicks in it\u2019s nice not to have to try to lift and squeeze that big gel bottle that\u2019s 1/2 full or 1/4 full to get it out..",

                "reviewText": "I have tried many similar product and some of them have very fancy designs and claim how good they work. Honestly I couldn't see too much difference on the outcome in terms of cleanliness among all products I have used, maybe because my dished are not way too greasy or creamy or dirty in some other way. I like this one more not only because it's affordable. I usually let my dishes dry by itself after wash, and some other brands will have some strange scents when I open the dishwasher right after wash but before drying, this one has no strange scent after wash. However, this product is easy to glue to each other if they get damp. And now I keep them in dry place and always pick the tablet with dry hands, and never has this issue again.",

They do a great job and of not getting water spots too. These are my go-to pods as a dishwasher soap solution. Oh, btw, the reason TV commercials keep telling us to rinse the dishes every day in the dishwasher is because new dishwashers seem to be more energy efficient which is code for not doing the job for which they are intended. Sure enough, my water bill went up, not down. I might start using these more often to make up for the dishwasher not doing its job. Maybe that will help. These do a great job from all I've tried, so I'm sticking with them.",

I\u2019ve had an issue with a soapy residue / film left on the dishes and I thought it was the dishwasher. It\u2019s a bit older and I thought maybe it just doesn\u2019t rinse thoroughly anymore. But I haven\u2019t noticed that issue the last week or so using these cute little squishies.Not really a noticeable scent for me though it says orange.
