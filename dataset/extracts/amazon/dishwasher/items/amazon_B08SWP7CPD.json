The basket is longer and a little bit more narrow than the original but fits well. It works better than the original basket by preventing items from spooning / nesting. It's not flimsy and shows no signs of wear in the two months that I've had it. As others have mentioned, the lid for the center compartment comes off easily; it looks like it has a latch but it's too short to work. This means that if jostled, the lid comes off. However, it doesn't come loose when the dishwasher is running. The manufacturer could improve the basket by making the center lid latch work better and having a way to lower the compartment lids (my Ikea Dragon 6.25\" salad forks and 5\" teaspoons just hang from the lid slots, not touching the bottom, and I wonder if the 'working' parts of them are 100% clean).",

While inspecting its visibly shoddy materials and workmanship it began to come apart in my hand. The twenty plus year old one I am replacing was actually in better shape than this brand new piece of junk. So sad that this kind of misrepresented garbage makes it on Amazon.",
