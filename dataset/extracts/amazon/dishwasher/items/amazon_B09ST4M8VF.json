                "reviewText": "I live in a rental apartment with a tiny, outdated kitchen and no dishwasher. Even for one person, the dishes can pile up fast and make it difficult to cook. Depending on the time of year, fruit flies and ants can also be a huge problem. I tolerated these issues for several years until I finally decided, enough is enough!Now that I've had this dishwasher for a few weeks, I am kicking myself for not doing this sooner. Having a dishwasher again is a huge life upgrade. My kitchen is so much cleaner!Pros:- Great value. Comes with everything you need and washes dishes just as well as a conventional dishwasher.- Quiet - The mechanisms inside are very quiet. However, because the dishwasher does not have the sound insulation of an under-counter dishwasher, expect to hear some sloshing noises as it cleans.- Easy to install and use- Comes with a clip-on sink connector that makes it super easy to attachCons:- Can't use the sink while the dishwasher is running. Minor inconvenience.- The sink attachment requires you to remove the sink aerator. So, unless you want to screw the aerator back on every time you use the sink, you basically have to get used to an aerator-free sink. Again, a minor inconvenience.- The internal height is a little short. The only spot that's tall enough for dinner plates to fit is in the back right corner, and they BARELY fit.- No dedicated spot for tall glasses/water bottles.- I don't love the configuration of the dish rack. The basket for the cutlery is in the front-middle of the drawer, so it gets in the way as you're loading the dishwasher (but you can take it out).- The tines are stuck in place so you can't get too creative with how you load it. The photo in the listing shows it loaded with your standard \"dish set\"--dinner plates, salad plates, small cereal bows, and small mugs. It works great for those things. It is designed for those things. Are those the types of dishes most people need to wash these days? Ehhhh. I am mostly washing plates, tupperware, water bottles, large glasses, cooking utensils, pans, etc. It's a bit of a puzzle to get these things to fit neatly.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is the first review I\u2019ve ever written and I had to for this one.I cook all day because I work from home and I am also a grad student on top of having a puppy and working out and trying to have a social life. I spent every night washing all the dishes I used that day and by the time I was done with work and school I was mentally exhausted. The least I wanted to do was sit there and wash dishes for another 20-35 minutes.This machine has changed my life. Literally. Sometimes I hear the water flush out, but that\u2019s only because it needs to deposit the water through the hose in the sink and I don\u2019t mind it at all. Some people may be very picky with noises. But it\u2019s not bad at all. It\u2019s pretty quiet through out the washing time. You have options to pick from of how long you want to wash for.I spent years washing dishes and I only regret not getting this sooner. I\u2019ve had it for about three months now and It\u2019s one of the best investments I\u2019ve ever made because it saves me about 168 hours a year which is about 210 minutes per week. That\u2019s a lot of time I can use to be doing something else. I just hope it lasts!It cleans the dishes so well! I\u2019ve put pans in there to try it out and they are the cleanest they\u2019ve ever been. I still hand wash big pots because this is a smaller washer but I don\u2019t mind it. I don\u2019t have to scrub for a bunch of time and dry out my hands anymore due to all the soap, hot and cold water, and time.It was a bit big for my kitchen but it fit perfect for the space I had available and I also don\u2019t have a big kitchen.I had to go to Home Depot to purchase a regular dishwasher kit hose attachment. Everything I saw online was not an option for me. It took me quite some time to figure it out for a day but by the end of the night someone finally figured out all I needed was a dishwasher kit. It is basically a regular dishwasher but something that fits on top of your counter. If you don\u2019t have a faucet that attaches with the hose it come with, and if you have a hole somewhere on the sink (I removed the soap place holder which I never use anyway) and ran the hose through there and attached it to the bottom of the cold water inlet. It\u2019s not hard at all. And plus I don\u2019t have something that looks odd on the faucet. It was hard for me at first because I couldn\u2019t find anything online that didn\u2019t have my faucet and I had no idea about dishwashers cause I never had one! I just had to buy a set of dishwasher hose (dishwasher kit at home-depot) which was roughly $25.I hope this helps some of you!",

                "reviewText": "I had a full sized dishwasher for years, but when it broke down I was financially strapped and couldn't replace it until now. I've always hated washing dishes by hand, so I have a habit of pre-rinsing and letting them pile up! This was my early Christmas present to myself this year, and I love it. I have a lot of countertop space in my kitchen, but have inadequate electrical outlets near the sink. So I bought a rolling cart to put it on. Now I just roll it over to the sink, fill it, plug it in, hook up the water hose, and I'm ready to go! I gave it a 4 star rating because there are two minor things that irritate me. First, the electrical cord is much too short! Second, the water hoses are made of a VERY STIFF plastic and are hard to hook up..and because they're so stiff, it's hard to get the water emptied out after the wash cycle is done. Have to put the hook up end in a bucket until it stops dripping or I end up with water all over my floor! So, I decided to replace the original hose hook up with a rubber one. It's on order and I haven't received it yet, so I'm hoping it will work..and be more flexible when emptying out the excess water after the wash cycle is done. Overall, I'm happy with the way it works. It's very quiet, until it starts emptying the water. Even that's not too bad. Cleans the dishes nicely, and they're almost completely dry. I just crack the door opened a bit and let them air dry the rest of the way before I empty it. As with all dishwashers, you have to figure out the best way to load them to fit in what you need to wash, but I've had no problems yet. Even handles pots, pans and large mixing bowls. I think it was a really great investment. Merry Christmas to me!!",
