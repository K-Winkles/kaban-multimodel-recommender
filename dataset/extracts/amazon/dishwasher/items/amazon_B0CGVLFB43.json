It will drain if you \"force\" it to drain by holding down the start button for 3 seconds, but you have to repeat that 4 times to get it to fully drain. Any thoughts? A: There are a few parts that could cause the issue. It seems like your problem is that it will not drain automatically. I would suggest checking your door latch switches just to make sure they are working. If they are not the machine may think the door is open and will not go into the automatic drain cycle. However, if that part is working then it may be your control board that is the issue. Q: Should the sump be drained completely at the end of the full cycle? When our dishwasher is done there is an inch or so of water in the bottom of the sump. A: The If there is water left over at the end of the cycle, I would suggest checking the water inlet valve to be sure its not leaking into the unit, the float switch and the drain pump itself. Also check the drain hose, to be sure there are no blockages preventing all the water from being pushed out of the unit. Q: Drain pump screaching, working but making noise A: there may be something stuck inside of it, otherwise you can to replace it altogether.",
