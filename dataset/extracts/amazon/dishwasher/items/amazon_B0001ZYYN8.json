        "description": "Product Description KitchenAid Artisan Series Refurbished 5 Qt. Tilt Head Stand Mixer model has a 325-watt motor, stainless steel bowl with comfort handle and a tilt-head mixer design that provides easy access to bowl and beaters. Burnished or coated beater included with purchase dependent on availability. Amazon.com KitchenAid's Artisan stand mixer is a substantial piece of equipment: 325 watts of mixing power make child's play of creaming butter, kneading dough, and whipping cream. The kid in you will appreciate how quick and easy it is to mix up a batch of cookie dough. This model comes with three attachments: a flat beater for making batter, meat loaf, and all textures in-between; a wire whip for egg whites, mayonnaise, and more air-infused creations; and a hook for mixing and kneading yeast doughs. All three are solidly constructed and easily secured to the beater shaft with a simple twist. The bowl itself locks tight to the base. Standing about 15 inches high, jutting out a foot, and weighing more than a grown woman's bowling ball, this stand mixer isn't the sort of appliance you'll wipe down and put away. Better to find a square foot of free counter space for easy access; besides, this machine is as pretty as it is rugged--you'll want to show it off. --Betsy Danheim Editor's note: This is a reconditioned small appliance. Reconditioned generally means that the appliance has been returned to the manufacturer, who brings the appliance back to like-new condition. Some appliances may contain cosmetic blemishes.",

                "reviewText": "The mixer I had before was ok. It did the job, until the electronic controls broke and the speed was kind of random.This mixer on the other hand is vastly superior than my previous Oster stand mixer, or my moms old Sunbeam (but she can't complain, she used it for 50 years).The biggest pros are the sturdiness and power of this mixer. It is also quiet and can do any job without lamentations.The standard stailess bowl is a plus too. I no longer have to worry about breaking it like I had with the old glass bowls. The 5.5 qt. bowl is a good size for me. I don't think I have any recipe that would exceed its capacity. Its smaller cousing may be too limited for weekend baker.The attachments are also easy to clean, and will probably never rust. My old attachments rusted a bit near the rivets because, I often will just let the dishes to dry in the dish rack. This is no longer a worry.If you think that you need the special chute to avoid messes, think again. This accessory is not at all needed. The refurb. model that I purchased did not have it. I had reservations about this when I placed my order, but after using the mixer, I soon realized that not only did I not need it, but it is probably a nuisance.This device greatest quality, sturdiness, is also the cause of its greatest defect; it is heavy. A frail person would not be able to handle it. This is not the kind of device that you can easily store in the cubboards. It is much better if you can devote counter space for it.I still have an unresolved question? Basically kitchen aid has two basic designs: one where the top part of the mixer pivots (my mixer) and one where the bowl goes up and down. I still wonder if one design is superior? I think that should be your only question when buying a kitchen aid mixer.I hope you enjoy this product as much as I did.",

                "reviewText": "I write this enjoying an oatmeal cherry cookie, fresh from the double batch just whipped up in the new Kitchenaid. It arrived today- 4 days after I ordered it- Talk about SUPER saver shipping! You all know what a Kitchenaid is- so I'm not gonna sing the praises of the mixer in general- but I'll tell ya about mine:It arrived double boxed- and tightly packed. The inner box, the Kitchenaid box, was plain white with green \"Factory Reconditioned\" letters on the side. I was nervous about how close to new this really would be...I opened it up and set it on the counter- Yes, there are two small blemishes on it- on the side of the unit- they look just like two #2 pencil points. Not bad- I expected far worse to be honest. And I plan on making this a workhorse anyway- the Kitchenaid, to me, isn't a showpiece (if it were, I'd buy NEW.) Two small dots aren't enough to make me want to pay twice what I did on this one.I inspected the paddle (what I use most) blade- perfect- The dough hook was also perfect. Both came nested tightly in the inner styrofoam. The whisk attachment, which arrived attached to the unit, was, indeed, a little bent out of shape. A little pressure on two sides put it right back to normal. I remember the first Kitchenaid I bought (a base-power plain white one) had the same issue. Really, not a big deal at all.The bowl was perfect as well- no scrapes- solid handle.It took me a little while to unknot the plug- was wound up in the bowl.I prepped everything and set to work- a double recipe of oatmeal cookies. This is the recipe that would bring the lesser Kitchaid to its knees- it would do it, but it would complain the whole time. The mixer did just fine with it. I'm happy to report- all operation is perfectly normal.Fron the for-what-it's-worth department- I've owned 3 Kitchenaids now- they have ALL definitely made a different sound running at lower speeds than at the higher speeds.I would purchase again without reservation.Again, I make my appliances work for me, rather than just look pretty. Expect a blemish here or there- Expect the performance and quality of a KitchenAid- and expect it to arrive a lot sooner than you'd think.",

I finally decided to upgrade and I couldn't find one ANYWHERE. I even called Kitchenaid and they told me this color had been retired. I was told to look for a refurbished one or a used one. The minute I saw this for sale on Amazon I jumped at it. It works beautifully and looks brand new. I LOVE it. I had my white one for 30 yrs. I gave it to someone who didn't own one, so now we are both happy!!!!",

I gave it a 4 for cleaning because there are few crevices where the bowl sits that you actually have to pay attention to to clean. Otherwise, it's perfect.",
