                "reviewText": "The main thing I like most about this is that: most dish washers need to be cleaned out regularly with a combination of vinegar and baking soda to remove the sulfate/byproduct of dishwasher detergent from the pipes. This bubbling tablet is basically baking soda with cleansers and deodorizers. So it serves several purposes to both declog the washer, clean it and deodorize it.I used it weekly for a month and the gunk that is normally visible in the pipes that drain the washer really disappeared. I have used vinegar and baking soda before which helped but these are so much more convenient.I use it on hot cycle once a week and my dishwasher smells fresh and good as new. No embarrassing odors when guests arrive and offer to help with the dishes.I also love the convenience of it and that the tablet totally dissolves after the washing cycle.This is a must purchase for convenience, scent and no fuss declogging.I have allergies and have to maintain a clean and hygienic home to stay on top off the allergens, I recently tried the active washing machine cleaner, and I am thoroughly impressed with the results. This product has become an essential part of my regular cleaning routine, and for good reason.First and foremost, the active washing machine cleaner really does effectively eliminate unpleasant odors and removes built-up residue from the interior drum of the washing machine. After using this cleaner, I noticed a significant improvement in the overall freshness of my laundry, as well as a reduction in musty odors that had been lingering in my machine.",

                "reviewText": "I have an older front load washer that has nearly always had a musty odor to it. I have gone so far as to remove all of the seals to clean the hard to reach areas. Every two weeks I clean the filter. I leave the door open so that it can dry out between washing. I run white vinegar through it during the \"Tub Clean Cycle\". None of that made a difference. The clothes don't have an odor to them, only the tub. I was just about to ditch the washer and buy a top load machine. I am so glad that I tried this product!! I just saved me from buying a new washing machine. I strongly recommend you give it a try. The product is so inexpensive... it's definitely worth a try.",

My washing machine had started to develop a musty odor, and I decided to give these tablets a try based on the positive reviews. I'm so glad I did!Firstly, the convenience of these tablets is unmatched. No measuring or messy liquids \u2013 just drop a tablet into the drum and let it work its magic. The effervescence is satisfying to watch, and I appreciate that it reaches all the nooks and crannies of the machine that are hard to clean manually.Not only did these tablets eliminate the unpleasant odor, but they also left my washing machine smelling fresh and clean after just one use. It's like a breath of fresh air every time I open the door now. The product is also septic-safe, which is a huge plus for those with septic systems.I've noticed a significant improvement in the cleanliness of my laundry since using these tablets. Clothes come out smelling better and feeling fresher. It's evident that these tablets do more than just mask odors \u2013 they tackle the root of the problem by removing build-up and residue.",

We live in an appt that provides the W/D so you can imagine they are NASTY! also my husband does construction and welding so he is always covered in muck and mud! The washer gets very dirty very fast. The clothes smelled even after two washes! I tried bleach, vinigar, baking soda, srubing by hand etc. Nothing cleaned my washer like this. And I have to say I freaked out after my first load. Smelling them like it was the first breath after jumping out of a pool. I ran up on my husband SMELL THIS SMELL IT (he was very confused but sniffed) and I was so excited my clothes were CLEAN and smelled like lavender (my soap) they have never smelled this good!I 100% suggest this product and I WILL be buying more!! I'm a life customer now!!!",

Our front-loader washer had started to develop a musty odor, and I was worried about mold and mildew buildup. These tablets came to the rescue!First of all, the 24 tablets provide a full year's supply, which is incredibly convenient. Each tablet is individually wrapped, making them easy to store and use. The instructions were straightforward, and using them was a breeze. I simply placed a tablet in the detergent dispenser and ran a hot cycle without any laundry.The results were astonishing! After just one use, our washing machine smelled fresh and clean. I also noticed that our clothes came out smelling better than they had in a long time. It's clear that these tablets effectively removed the built-up residue and gunk from the drum and the laundry tub seal.I appreciate that these tablets are septic-safe and eco-friendly, so I don't have to worry about harming the environment or our septic system. Knowing that I'm using a product that's safe for both my family and the planet gives me peace of mind.Overall, these Washing Machine Cleaner tablets have exceeded my expectations. They offer excellent value for the money, provide a year's worth of cleaning, and deliver outstanding results. I highly recommend them to anyone looking to keep their washing machine and laundry smelling fresh and clean. Say goodbye to musty odors and hello to cleaner, fresher laundry!",
