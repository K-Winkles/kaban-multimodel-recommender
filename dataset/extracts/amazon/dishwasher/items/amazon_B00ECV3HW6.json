                "reviewText": "This replacement rack fit my Maytag Performance dishwasher model number PDB4600AWX just fine. Actually, it seems sturdier than the original rack, so that is great. My old rack had 6 wheels just like this new one. My silverware basket fits fine in the same place on this new one. It is gray in color as opposed to the original white one, so now my original top rack is white and the new bottom rack is gray which is fine with me. We had no trouble moving the sprayer tower to the new rack, so everything works as expected. I gave 4 stars for the price of $195. 00. That is about one third of a new appliance. I just think it is too much for a dishwasher rack, but I needed to replace my old rusted one, so I ordered it. Also, I noticed yesterday it was $183, but today back up to the price I paid. One final thing, in the description it said, \"Hurry, there's only 3 left!\" That rushed me into deciding to buy quickly because I didn't want them to sell out and not get one. Well with my purchase, there should be 2 left. One week later it still says 3 left. I guess this tactic worked to get me to buy it quickly for that big price. All in all it works great in my dishwasher.",

                "reviewText": "It seems that Whirlpool makes the part for my Maytag dishwasher. My existing rack was starting to rust, so it had to go, but the dishwasher works great still and similar replacements cost $700 and (way) up. So while this part isn't cheap, it's a far cheaper alternative to replacing the dishwasher. The replacement rack is nearly identical to the existing rack, and an online search quickly pointed me to all the tips I needed to remove the center part from the old rack (which comes separately and costs ~$50) and install it on the new rack. The rack is a perfect fit in my dishwasher. I netted big savings over buying the rack at dealer markup and paying the service tech to \"install\" it, and even bigger savings over buying a new dishwasher.",

                "reviewText": "Over the years my dishwasher's lower rack had gotten rusted & many prongs broke off & disappeared (where did they go?); it was also a very noisy dishwasher. When I replaced the rack, not only did it fit perfectly, but now that my dishes were being supported properly, there was no more clanging & banging as the cycle ran! My dishwasher is quiet again, AND the dishes are cleaner - again because they are being properly supported in the dishwasher.",
