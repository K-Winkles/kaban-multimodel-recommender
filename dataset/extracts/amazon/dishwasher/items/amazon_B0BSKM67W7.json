                "reviewText": "I needed a pie plate and quickly. The options on Amazon were vast but a bit pricier than what I was seeing at Home Goods. I wanted a glass pie dish and the store I was at only had the fancy enamel ones for $10. So I assumed a plain glass one would be available at a good price. I found this combo 2 pack offering to be the closest to what I wanted and it came out to about $10 each. I was desperate as I needed more pie plates for holiday pies.The standard dish is just that. Reliable Pyrex pie plate like the ones I already had. The surprise was the extra deep pie dish. Wow! At first I was frustrated as that dish was not a great option for a pumpkin pie.It has been 2 months since I got this combo pack and only used the standard plate once for a pie. I have used the deep dish several times for many reasons. It is amazing and I never would have thought of it. I baked pasta and veggie dishes with it. It is a great bake to serve option. Wow a deep dish quiche.... yeess. I am so happy I picked this and really I did because of the price point. Other sellers wanted up to $20 for a Pyrex clear glass plate. Silly.Classic product with good quality and a surprise size you did not know you needed in your life.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this combo for the extra deep dish pie pan. I make berry pie most of the summer. This pie pan is perfect. It's deep enough that it never boils over. And the pies come out 2-3 inches thick. It's perfect. If you love pie, this is the pan.Summer pie recipe:Put a crust into your pan, prebake crust so it comes out flakey. An easy way to do this is to put the crust in the pan, poke the crust all over with a fork, then put parchment paper over the crust, and pour beans or rice onto the paper to fill the pie pan. (Some people use pie weights, but this works if you don't have weights) Bake for ten-fifteen minutes. Pull the parchment paper and beans out of the pan.Note: If you don't fill the pie crust with weights or the parchment paper and rice combo before you bake, the crust will shrink and end up at the bottom of the pan.I take a mixture of frozen peaches, cherries, blueberries, strawberries, pineapple, raspberries, and blackberries and place then in a large pot. Set to low.Squeeze an entire lemon over the berries. Throw a tiny bit of vanilla in there, a tea spoon of ground ginger, and a couple dashes of cinnamon.Add 3/4 cup of sugar and stir gently.Once it's soupy stir in a 1/4 cup of corn starch.Pour contents into your pie pan and bake at 375 for 65 minutes.Let cool completely (3-4 hours). If you don't let it cool, it'll be runny.",
