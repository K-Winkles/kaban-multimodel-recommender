                "reviewText": "Update! 5 months later, this is a great little dishwasher, cleans very well, I can get a surprising amount of dishes loaded, noise level is LOW. You really can\u2019t beat it for the price!! I\u2019ve had this now for a couple weeks. The main reason for an 18\u201d dishwasher was a space issue, I had a perfect spot in my 1958 original kitchen without have to remodel both lower cabinets \ud83e\udd17 I did have a plumber install, it was a quick job. I am very happy with it. Noise level I consider low, have had many dishwashers over the years, Bosch, Kenmore, etc. Cleans very well, although like most dishwashers if you put the Mac n cheese casserole dish in without basically washing before hand don\u2019t complain. Dries sufficient, I read a lot!! of reviews on different 18\u201ddishwashers and the most common complaint was drying. This one does a more than decent job drying ( I usually don\u2019t unload till the next day anyhow). I almost bought an $800 dishwasher and decided to save a couple hundred bucks and go with this one, I\u2019m glad I did. I think it\u2019s a great value for the money I would highly recommend the EdgeStar BIDW1802WH.",

I was missing the mounting brackets and there was a slight tear in the plastic condensation shield. I called the factory, and they answered the phone immediately. The customer service person \"Brym\" was really on the ball and looked up the parts and I will have them in a couple of days. This was so easy. Even without mounting the dishwasher had been tested thoroughly first and works great.",

                "reviewText": "First off, I am super pleased with it so far. Only been a month so longevity issues are still a concern. Install was easy, doesn\u2019t come with a power cord or any power cabling at all. Buy the dishwasher install kit on amazon and it\u2019ll work out fine. Wired it up, hooked the drain and the hot water to the sink and started washing. I Live in a little single wide mobile home so space was limited but I hate handwashing I feel dishes never get really clean. This thing cleans really good, I really am impressed and it holds quite a bit. I\u2019ve found if you wash on heavy load on the \u201csanitize\u201d setting, dishes get the cleanest. One gripe is that you have to choose the load settings each time, why it can\u2019t just save what you did last time. Took a star away for that. Heavy load takes 2hr 40 min express takes 90 minutes. About the industry average these days. My friends Bosch takes like 4 hours, it\u2019s ridiculous. It is very quiet too. I honestly wasn\u2019t thinking it would be this quiet and was wondering if it was even working at times, so if anyone on here says it\u2019s loud, you must have the most sensitive ears on the planet. Seriously whisper quiet. I love it, just hope it lasts cuz it does feel a bit on the cheap side, but we shall see.Update 12/9/2019Still working great. Cleans my dishes great. The rinse aid dispenser really get those dishes to dry nicely without spots or residue. Really impressed with this thing.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this item to replace an Edgestar dishwasher purchased in 2015. While that one still worked, I wanted a replacement to a newer model. This one is relatively quiet, and seems to clean the dishes much better, without leaning residue, and the controls/display is nicer, and now includes a countdown timer to show how much longer is left in the cycle.It appears there\u2019s no way to turn off the led display. At the end of the cycle, it displays \u201cEnd\u201d, and after being opened, it displays \u201c-:- -\u201c.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This product is junk. Total irrefutable junk. Listen, this is the most honest review you'll see here. Take it from me - a master electrician that works full time as a maintenance engineer for a hospital. I work on plumbing systems, huge boilers, appliance repairs, and electrical repairs daily. I know my stuff.We had a unit from EdgeStar (more like JunkStar) that we ordered in June of 2023. Well, here we are in December of 2023 with a flooded kitchen and an E4 code, like other recent one star reviews are seeing as well. No issues other than a busted drain pump. So I cleaned it all up, and managed to somehow get ahold of customer support, and they did send me a new unit.Guess what? New unit has the EXACT same issue right out of the box. This video I've attached is the rinse cycle running on the brand new replacement unit. I just rebuilt the plumbing in the sink this weekend, for good measure. I know for a fact the drain lines are in good shape.The E4 code triggered 15 minutes into its first cycle, and it flooded my kitchen. Again.Seriously, this may be the worst product I've ever purchased in my life. I'm a professional in the industry, please listen to me. Do not understand any circumstances order this trash. You WILL regret it.",

This was the best value and we could actually obtain it within days. The other purchase options from Lowes, Home Depot, etc. for this size were very limited, way more expensive and would have taken months to receive. It arrived in great condition, excellent packing, we installed it ourselves without any problems and it works great. We were concerned about the interior space, would the blades hit the plates, would it clean the dishes as well, what would the noise level be, would we be able to put a sufficient amount of dishes and silverware in the smaller unit, etc. It has surpassed our expectations. We recommended our friend purchase one for his cabin after using it for a month with no issues.",
