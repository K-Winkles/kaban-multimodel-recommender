Designed especially for wide mouth bottles and nipples, the Munchkin High Capacity Dishwasher Basket gives you the day off from bottle washing duty! With its jumbo size, you can fit all of your little one's baby items and bottle parts into the basket and run them through the dishwasher without worrying that you'll lose track of them once the wash cycle ends. This handy dishwasher caddy features a patented straw cleaning rack on the side to hold straws upright and firmly in place for a thorough clean. Flip the lid open and place pacifiers, spoons, bottle sealing discs, valves, caps and other small parts into the basket. Easily press nipples into the nipple sanitizing lid, snap into place, and you are set to wash without worry! Just load up the basket and let your dishwasher do the dirty work while you get down to business spending time with your little one.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this basket thinking I would use it often for all of the baby products that come with a newborn. It is a great option for making clean-up more efficient although I found personally that I most often just washed the products in the sink basin instead due to not running the dishwasher frequently enough to get the products when I needed them. The product itself though is effective, sturdy and convenient if you have enough of each baby product to wait for them to go through the dishwasher. The capacity is large enough to contain quite a few bottle parts, pacifiers, lids, etc.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought this Munchkin High Capacity Dishwasher Basket mostly for my toddler's sippy cup covers and valves, which had a tendency to fall at the bottom of our dishwasher during the washing cycle. The basket itself is sturdy, yet flexible, and it has a large lower basket compartment to hold collars, valves, spouts, pacifiers, teethers, caps, spoons, and basically any sippy cup accessories, or small parts.The middle section of the basket has a divider that lets you store items in the smaller upper basket, keeping them separated from the items in the lower basket. This prevents the accessories from tangling together during the washing cycle, while also allowing empty space in between the 2 basket layers; promoting for better water/detergent distribution and circulation. The top compartment itself can be used for nipples, covers, pacifiers and whatnot.The exterior of the basket also includes a straw holder that not only keeps the straws upright, but also firmly holds them in place during the wash cycle. And finally, the basket is easy to open with a flip lid that simply closes by snapping it back into place. It is also noteworthy to mention that the divider can be completely removed from the basket, thus making it possible to put in even larger items and taking advantage of the basket's full size.I've been using this basket in the top rack of my dishwasher every day for a few months now, and it hasn't lost it's shape and the lid still snaps easily into place. I've even started using the basket for my small salad dressing containers and it works brilliantly well. Great purchase. Would recommend.If my review was helpful let me know by clicking on the ''Helpful'' button bellow :) \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
