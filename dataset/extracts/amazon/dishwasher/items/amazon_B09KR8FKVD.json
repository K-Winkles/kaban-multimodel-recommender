                "reviewText": "First the pros: Very well priced, neutral gray color, perfect fit for our older Frigidaire dishwasher, multiple good sized compartments for silverware and miscellaneous utensils, nice handle for easy pickup and removal of the basket.The cons: The hinged cover for the large middle compartments sticks and is somewhat difficult to open on the front and yet it often falls off when attempting to remove silverware because the hinge on the back doesn\u2019t hold it firmly in place. Almost all the handles on my silverware are too wide to fit through the slots (on the top of the compartment cover) designed to hold and separate the pieces of silverware. And it seems a little brittle to me.It has held up very well so far through multiple high heat wash/dry cycles so I\u2019m basically happy with it. I removed the middle compartment cover because it became annoying but I don\u2019t mind because the old basket didn\u2019t have any covers at all. Seems great for a generic basket. I didn\u2019t want to spend double for the basket made specifically for my model so this will work just fine until we finally get a new dishwasher.",

                "reviewText": "We've had our Kenmore Elite dishwasher since 2009. The silverware basket has taken a lot of abuse from years of putting the silverware in sharp side down. The forks and knives really cut into the plastic and create holes that the silverware falls right through. This got annoying to the point it was time to fix it. My wife wanted us to buy a brand new dishwasher. I figured I'd try this Universal basket and I'm glad I did. It may not be an exact match as an OEM but it's close enough. Seems well made and like it'll last for years. Probably even longer if I can convince everyone in the house to put silverware sharp side up.",
