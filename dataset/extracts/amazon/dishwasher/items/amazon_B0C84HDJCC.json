                "reviewText": "So far, the dishwasher is working rather well. It has a pretty impressive capacity considering I switched from a standard size dishwasher. However, the lettering on the control buttons started rubbing off after a week or so. \"Power\" and \"Start\" are completely gone at this point. That's not ideal and makes me a little nervous that the product wasn't well designed/ thought out. Very effective so far at cleaning dishes. I bought this brand because the air conditioner I purchased was top-notch and better than any other I've owned.",

                "reviewText": "This 18\" wide compact dishwasher from the Chinese manufacturer Midea has features that match a full sized counterpart. Your typical set of Wash Cycle Modes allow you to select the best option for what you are needing to wash. I like the ECO and Quick modes as we typically wash and rinse our dishes well before putting them in the dishwasher for a final sanitary cleaning. If you only need a heated rinse and dry then the Rinse mode is great for that. No soap needed.This dishwasher requires the typical hookups of a hot water line and a 15A dedicated circuit. Electrical code in the 2020's typically requires a receptacle in the adjacent cabinet with full access to it. That way a corded plug can be wired to the dishwasher and unplugged for servicing if needed. No need to find a breaker panel and breaker. A dishwasher braided flexible hose with a 90 end to 3/8\" is also a great choice as it allows for bending and moving which is needed to connect and push the dishwasher into the cabinet space. It should likewise come thru a sidewall of the cabinet into an adjoining and accessible space with a hot water supply shutoff.The dishwasher comes with both mounting options to allow securing the underside of a counter top, or side securing into adjoining cabinetry. It also has a removable toe kick to allow access underneath it.The front mounted controls are buttons that are convenient to access and push. Easy to read and properly label in English. An LED display provides cycle time lengths, temperature settings and door locked indications. The dishwasher isn't as quiet as a premium Bosch unit but it still is relatively low on noise.Overall this is a nice and full featured compact dishwasher. It makes an excellent option for small apartments or studio flats. It also makes a great second dishwasher that comes in handy not only for large gatherings but also really for everyday household use. You can use larger dishes, pots and pans in your main dishwasher and keep this smaller one for cups and glasses. Or have it installed in a bar area for separation of bar ware from kitchen ware. It is so versatile. I like it and think it deserves a full 5 stars for quality and performance.",

                "reviewText": "We replaced a KitchenAid dishwasher with a Bosch-made Thermador about two years ago. Now we add this Midea. I mention this to give a point of reference for my experience in writing this review..I got this dishwasher from Amazon's Vine program which gives products to reviewers in return for reviews. Despite Amazon not charging for Vine items, reviewers have to pay income tax and social security self-employment on the list value of items received. I pay somewhere between 20 and 25% of Amazon's product price in taxes for items received through Vine, thus I'm selective in what I order...This 18\" dishwasher is best for a small kitchen, a second kitchen, a basement snack area, etc. It holds a more than you might think for how small it looks. But since it is 3/4 the size of our main dishwasher I suspect its ability to hold a dinner load shouldn't be so surprising.The dishwasher's main positives include:1) Full stainless interior2) Quiet. This dishwasher doesn't quite rival our Thermador in quietness, but it's quiet, especially for the price.3) Normal cycle is 2.5 hours. There is also, however, a quick clean 1-hour cycle. Both clean well.4) Easily understood and used front control panel. Far easier than our other dishwashers.Midea is a Chinese appliance manufacturer. Midea made appliances for other companies for many years and more recently began selling appliances under its own brand name in the USA. MIdea appliances are often well reviewed. Its innovative window air conditioners are well-regarded and its dehumidifiers are also well-reviewed also. Large dishwashers are a new category for the company, but its initial 24-inch model has been well reviewed.I'm most concerned about longevity with appliances and that's something I can't vouch for in a review this early after receiving the dishwasher.Installation is typical with the exception of the location of the water inlet and the electrical supply port/box. you must supply a water line and the electric cable. If you're uncomfortable doing this you'll need to ask a friend to help who is, or hire it done. Hiring will probably cost 50% of the purchase price, however. The location of the water and electric supply connections is at the bottom, as typical, but atypically the attachment locations are back-facing at the front of the machine. So you must run supply to the front in a channel underneath the machine. Taping the electric cable and water supply to the top of the channel is probably the easiest method of keeping the lines from interfering when you push the connected dishwasher back into place.Overall, this seems a fine dishwasher initially--especially at the very reasonable price.",

We had our landlord get a plumber to install it since we didn't feel comfortable messing with plumbing or electricity but he did say it was a simple installation.We have had no mishaps with leaks and the actual washing/drying is great! everything is squeaky clean after running a cycle and very dry. It makes a humming and water sloshing noise as it's working on a cycle but that's to be expected with any appliance. It's very quiet considering the job it does!",
