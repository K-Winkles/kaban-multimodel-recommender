As you can see from my pictures, the old gasket had a rip in it from the silverware going in and out one of the utensils must\u2019ve caught the old gasket and ripped it. Purchased and installed this new gasket, and the dishwasher works flawless. I will update if there\u2019s any changes. Easy install took about five minutes and I cut the bottom of the gasket on the same angle as the original.",

                "reviewText": "My Kenmore dishwasher started leaking since and I started hunting out YouTube videos to see what solutions were out there. One option was to replace the inner seal of the dishwasher. As I watched the video,I saw that this was easy even for novice do-it-yourselfers. This gasket is easily removed by gentle pulling and equally easy to install with just some slight pressure. Do note the orientation of the seal you remove so you can be sure to put the new one on in the same way. Good news...if your don't it's easy to remove again and flip around to putting back on the right way. One tip...find the middle of the gasket and start installing from the middle and then down each side. That was your know you have the finished product equal on both sides. Thank goodness for YouTube videos! It saved me a few hundred dollars to not have a repairman come in and so this really simple repair. All told, it shouldn't take a novice more than 20 minutes for the whole repair.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the W11177741 dishwasher gasket door seal by Lusperi for my Whirlpool dishwasher model:wdta50sahz0. My dishwasher was experiencing leaks at the bottom of the door and decided to try replacing the seal first before purchasing a new lower spray arm which is more expensive. Always best to try cheapest repairs first.Pros:1. Easy Installation: The gasket door seal was incredibly easy to install. It came with clear instructions that made the process hassle-free. I didn't need any special tools or expertise to get the job done, I simply pulled the old one out and pushed the new one in. One piece of advice while installing the new one is to soak a cloth with soapy water and run along the entire length of the new seal. This will allow the seal to pop into place much easier and with little to no effort at all.2. Perfect Fit: The Lusperi gasket door seal is compatible with Whirlpool and Kenmore dishwashers, and it fit my Whirlpool model perfectly. It lined up with the door and created a tight seal. I did need to trim a small bit from the ends3. Effective Seal: One of the main reasons I purchased this gasket door seal was to prevent any water leakage from my dishwasher. I'm happy to report that it does an excellent job of sealing the door tightly. I could easily tell looking at both my old and the new gasket, it was time for a change. My old gasket was quite flat at the time of replacement.Cons:1. Slightly Pricey: Compared to some other gasket door seals available in the market, the Lusperi version is a bit pricier. However, considering its effectiveness and the fact that it is compatible with multiple dishwasher brands, and is made of high-quality material, I believe it is worth the investment.This dishwasher gasket door seal by Lusperi is a reliable and effective product. It is easy to install, fits perfectly, and seals the dishwasher door tightly, preventing any leaks and provides excellent value for the price. Although this did not fix my leaking problem as it was later found to be the lower spray arm, I highly recommend this gasket door seal for Whirlpool and Kenmore dishwasher owners looking to replace their old or worn-out seals, even if you're not experiencing leaks at the moment.",
