                "reviewText": "I used to use a pan for making large meals and (depending on the recipe) they would overflow out of my large saute pan. I bought this one because it sounded big enough to hold a lot of food and not spill over. It did just that. I can make big meals now without having to use two different pots and pans. I just cook in the one big pan and it's great! The non-stick aspect of it is a plus as well. I will say that once I purchased the pan it was too wide for our stove and it would go over the edge of the stove, but since we got a new stove it works great on the biggest burner and evenly distributes the heat. Would highly recommend.",

Easy to pick up due to 2 handles and clear lid helps prevent burning. Browns meat nicely with butter, not so much with oil. Similar pan $10 cheaper at wholesale club but not same brand. Cleans easy, limitless options.",

                "reviewText": "Granted, I have only used it once - but I love the lighter weight and the size of the pan. May not hold up quite as long as the high dollar, heavier pans, but for this size of pan I need to be able to easily lift with one hand and pour out excess oil then also pour out gravy while using a spatula iin the other hand which is super difficult with the heavier pans. Worked great for chicken fried steak. Exactly the size I wanted. Good value. Like the color.",

Needless to say having a much lighter weight pan that has two handles that don't heat up with the pan is a game changer. The lid is a nice touch also. I never did find a lid that exactly fit the iron skillet. Very happy with it. Its coated on the inside making it a breeze to clean. Love it.",
