Our house has hard water (I could probably make mineral supplements from the deposits left behind after a week of using my small air humidifier) and does not have a water softener system (naughty, naughty). However, our dishes still come out spotless when using this.Along with other reviewers, I have to say that the packaging sucks, specifically the cap. There's no way to pour the liquid into the dishwasher's reservoir with finesse -- you'll have to accept that some of it will slosh out of the bottle onto the door as you tip it over to pour. I got annoyed enough to transfer it to another container to avoid waste. If it weren't for this, I'd have given 5 stars across the board.",

I often ended up rewashing these items by hand. We tried unscented dishwasher tabs, but that didn't solve the problem. This unscented rinse aid did the trick. And it seems to be as effective as regular scented rinse aids.I agree with other reviewers that the mechanism is poorly designed and it's easy to be sloppy when filling the reservoir. But that's a universal problem.Will buy again.",
