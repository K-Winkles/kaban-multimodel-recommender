Following installation of new pocket replacement windows.There\u2019s several cavities beneath the kitchen window. Foamed around and the sill. But don\u2019t wanna mess with the pee trap for the sink inside the wall or wire to the new outlet.We\u2019re using this to stuff inside the crevices since pink insulation tends to collapse over time. This won\u2019t. It\u2019ll be dense enough tucked to add a barrier.We\u2019ve used denim like wool insulation in other rooms along the cracks behind the trim while restore trim. This product is similar. Though much thinner.Since we\u2019re tucking it in the spaces should work well long term.Based on description expected twice as thick. Why only four stars. For a dishwasher should be adequate.",
