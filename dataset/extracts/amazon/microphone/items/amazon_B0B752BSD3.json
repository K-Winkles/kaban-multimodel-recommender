I've tested even how far you could get from your phone and this would work perfectly for any content creator! You can step further away from your phone if needed if you're in the gym or something and it's also great for talking videos! I use it along with the captions app for any video editing and they work so well together to cancel out any additional noise in the video!",

                "reviewText": "I got these for the purpose of recording Instagram reels, YouTube videos, TikTok, etc. Also, I record my sessions with my personal trainer and often had the problem of not being able to hear him in the video over the other background noise in the CrossFit gym: people talking loudly around us, weights clanging and echoing, loud music. Unless he was standing next to my phone.This mic set has been a game changer. Now, all of that noise fades into the background and is hardly audible. I love that this has 2 mics, so he and I both wear one for our sessions. Now I can hear him on the video even when he is far from the phone.During one recent session I was doing a sled pull down a length of turf. He was at the other end and you can hear him clearly as if he was standing next to the phone. Another trainer was talking to his client next to my phone and isn\u2019t audible at all.Here\u2019s what\u2019s great:\u2022 super easy plug and play. Take them out of the case, plug in the receiver to the bottom of the phone, clip on the mics, and you\u2019re good to go. No need to connect manually.\u2022 clear audio even from across a loud gym\u2022 everything in a charging case makes it easy to transport. The case fits in the palm of my hand.What could be better:\u2022 it\u2019s not clear how the manual noise cancellation works. The manual is tiny print and hard to read\u2022 the microphones are a little large and when clipped onto the neck of my trainer\u2019s t-shirt they stick in his neck. I clip mine onto my sports bra strap. I\u2019d love a mic that was a little smaller.Those are little issues. The bottom line is that this mic works well and does what it needs to do at a fraction of the price of some well-known brands.Just get it.",

The batteries just keep going and capturing great sound. Highly recommend them.",

                "reviewText": "Update: I lost my first pair and ordered a second one. The second set worked for just a few videos, and then began malfunctioning. For some reason, it remains stuck on the function that picks up lots of background noise. I have to manually click into the noise, cancellation mode, but unfortunately, there is a ton of static over my voice when I use that mode. I randomly click into other modes, and sometimes find a setting where my voice sounds decent. But then, for whatever reason, the set automatically resets to the version full of static, without any warning. This means that I have recorded tons of video, only to review it, and realize that the static over my voice renders this video useless. I have had to go back numerous times to re-record very lengthy footage, which is frustrating and time-consuming. I looked online for a customer service number, but their website security certificate expired five days ago, and my browser will not let me visit the site. Thus, I cannot even ask for a replacement set.Original review: I use these little microphones to do voiceovers for my TikToks, and they have worked wonderfully. They have vastly improved the sound quality of my narration, and give my videos crystal clear voiceovers. The battery life is also surpassingly impressive.",

There doesn't appear to be any way to contact the seller for replacement.These work well, sound good and connected easily to the iPhone. We use them for creating content. They are much better than recording my voice in the room. Plus you get 2 so you can have another person in your videos. The only issue we had was not realizing the small front button, closest to the mic, is a mute button. I started a live video after doing a test and the mic worked; then I started the live stream and no one could hear me. I couldn't figure out at that moment what happened, so I took off the mic and went with the phone mic for that stream. Afterwards, I figured out the mute button. So, that's the one thing this needs imo - is some kind of indication when it's muted. However, once I figured out what happened, they work great.",
