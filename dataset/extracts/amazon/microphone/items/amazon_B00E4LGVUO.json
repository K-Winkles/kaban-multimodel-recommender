                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Must be fitted properly to hear bass frequencies",
                "reviewText": "If you've been wondering how such a highly-rated product like this can also have one-star reviews stating these earbuds have \"absolutely no bass whatsoever\" and sound \"horribly tinny\", I'd like to offer an explanation.These Panasonics are not designed to be placed in the ears and worn like classic earbuds. If that's how you wear them, you'll get nothing but tinny sound at relatively low volume (think 1960's pocket transistor radio.) These earbuds are specifically designed to fit snugly into the ear, forming an airtight seal. If you choose too small of an earpad and/or don't push them in far enough, you won't hear any low-end frequencies. It's only when you get an airtight seal that the earbuds will instantly come alive with full-range sound and volume.Here's a quick analogy: Tightly plug both ears with your fingers, close your mouth, and hum the lowest note you can. Now take your fingers away, and notice how almost all of the low end and volume drops out. That's the difference between a proper fit and an improper fit with these earbuds. Although the acoustic principles are different, these earbuds must literally plug your ears in order to give you the full frequency spectrum. Otherwise they'll sound horrendous.Unfortunately, Panasonic wasn't very forthcoming on their product's packaging about how to wear the earbuds, and I'm certain some unwitting consumers are throwing away perfectly good pairs.As an audio engineer, I can assure you these earbuds, when properly fitted, sound excellent for the price. They're not audiophile-quality earbuds with the sonic transparency of a $200 pair of studio-reference headphones, and they're not as ergonomic as a $150 pair of Westones, but for the price, they are an exceptionally fantastic bargain. Do they have a lot of bass? They're not deficient in any of the low frequencies, but they're not bass-enhanced earbuds, either, which some of you may be used to. They have a relatively nice, flat bass response as is, but if you want extra bottom end on your music, you'll want to boost the low end of your MP3 player's EQ. Fortunately, boosted lows, even the deepest of lows, are handled very well by these Panasonics.As a result of how these earbuds are designed to be worn, they could be uncomfortable for some people to wear for extended periods of time. The earpads are very soft and pliable, though, and I personally don't experience any discomfort wearing them. Since these earbuds are designed to be wedged into your ear, there are two unique, negative issues to point out:1. Be very careful not to drop your MP3 player, because having earbuds ripped out of your ear canal is not a pleasant experience.2. These earbuds may amplify the sound of your heartbeat when it's racing during an intense workout. The incessant \"tick tick tick\" is loud enough that it becomes extremely annoying during quiet passages in the music you're listening to.In summary, the audio quality of these earbuds, when properly fitted, will satisfy 99.9% of the general population. I would not recommend them for bike riding or street running since they block out ambient noise, and if you're an audio engineer, you may find them a touch brittle on the high end, but if you need some quality earbuds to tune out the world for a while, these Panasonics are an excellent choice and a phenomenal value.",

Comparado ao fone que eu vinha usando (um HP H100 - que tem grande qualidade sonora, mas \u00e9 um fone pesado, que atrapalha durante uma corrida, por exemplo), oferece outra experi\u00eancia.Tirei 1 ponto do quesito \"Conforto\" porque os fones n\u00e3o encaixaram 100% no meu ouvido, mesmo trocando as almofadas M pelas G.
