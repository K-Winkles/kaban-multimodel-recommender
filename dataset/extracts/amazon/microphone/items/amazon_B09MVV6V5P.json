                "reviewText": "5 month UPDATE:This thing is STURDY! It has stood up to the beating my toddler gives it. It's literally tossed about on hard floors daily. My toddler plays with it everyday, except for when we hide it when we're out of batteries.Which brings me to a major CON: THIS THING EATS BATTERIES. I'd say on average it gets about 20 mins of use each day and dies after about 2 weeks. We really love it though. You've been warned.ORIGINAL REVIEW:ConsHeavier then expected. Although it's nice sturdy plastic, I get a little on edge when my daughter drops it on onto the tiled floor. Wish it came with a rubberised glove or something. For now, play time with it will remain heavily supervised as she's only 12 months old.Speaker gets crackly/buzzy and distorted when you get too loud or too close to the mic. This is the biggest con for me because while the speaker gets sufficiently loud (imo) for a small toy, I just wish it handled louder sounds better. Paid $9 and would gladly pay three times that for a better quality speaker. That said, it's still a great toy and I don't regret the purchase.ProsFeels to be made of sturdy materials.Volume control15 nursery rhymes songs along with the option to play instrumentals only so you can sing along, karaoke style.5 voice filtersApplause buttonBluetooth!! Okay, so this was not a selling point for me but when I tried it, it really peaked my 12 month old's interest. How it works, is, you hold down the Bluetooth button and it beeps and tells you a code, then you search for the mic with your device's Bluetooth and, presto, you can play anything you want on the toy's speaker. Pro tip: play Ms Rachel's songs and keep your kid entertained for a significant duration.",
