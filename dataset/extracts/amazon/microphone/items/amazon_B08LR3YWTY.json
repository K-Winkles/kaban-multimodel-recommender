The sound is crisp and can be heard clearly at both indoor or outdoor parties with ease. Like any microphone, standing too close to or directly in front of the speaker will induce feedback so be mindful of where you stand in relation to the speaker when in smaller or confined spaces. Other than that, I have no complaints and it works perfectly for what it is intended to do. It's a reasonably priced microphone for those family and friends parties where Karaoke is part of the fun! I would recommend it to anyone who owns a JBL Partybox speaker.",

Very light weight which can be good or bad depending on the situation. I needed something quick and wanted to match my speaker sets for a party so im stuck with it. They have better mics for the same price that are a little more durable.",
