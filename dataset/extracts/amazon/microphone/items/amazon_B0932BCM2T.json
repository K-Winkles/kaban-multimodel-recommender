Top-addressed cardioid pickup, you will need to position it with the top of the microphone facing towards the sound source when using it. Make sure to speak directly into the top of the microphone, as this will provide the best sound quality. Why does it not work with my Android phone but function well with my iPhone 15? Please ensure that your Android device supports OTG and verify that it's enabled in the settings before use. (Search for \"OTG\" in the settings and enable it.) Is the mic compatible with the Mac book? The mic is compatible with Macbook and doesn't require any additional drivers. Make sure to check your Mac settings and ensure that the mic is recognized as an input source. As an ASMR artist, I am experiencing excessive noise with this microphone, how can you help me resolve it? The noise-canceling function is OFF by default. To activate noise cancel, press and hold the mute button until it turns blue. What is the recommended distance to keep when using this desktop cardioid microphone? The recommended distance to keep when using this microphone is generally between 6 to 12 inches from your mouth. But it's best to experiment with different distances to find the optimal one for your needs.",

Looks like initially I have received a defective item, but the replacement works amazingly. It does a great job with recording wind instruments. The gain control is very handy. I put it at 25% when recording the flute and increase it to 50% when I\u2019m talking. It\u2019s great at noise cancellation. With my settings, it looks like it is picking up sounds in 2 feet radius from it. It\u2019s perfect for my needs.Original: This microphone picks up every noise in the room. The MIC control nob is so useless. It won't pick up anything until it is at 1/4th level. once you go beyond that, it pick up every sound. I don't know what's the point of that design.If you want a Blue Yeti look a like. This is the one to get but the sounds quality is not comparable to Blue Yeti.",

                "reviewText": "Tldr: A great budget option as long as you're not looking for something extremely professional.--I usually keep the microphone about a feet away from me due to how my desk is situated, and it still picks up my voice without too many problems. I only use it for the occasional Discord or Zoom call though, and maybe a Twitch stream here or there, I can't say if it's good for gaming or recording.Some breakdowns:Quality: You can hear yourself just fine, but it's not like super crisp quality or anything. Just slightly above average good enough to use type.Background noises: I do not hear any keyboard or mouse click noises from the mic, so this is pretty decent. If you like bang the table or something it'll still pick up a bit though.Multiple voices: It definitely picks up voices very well. I have a noisier house and it would pick up other people's voices as long as they're in the vicinity.Music: It might not pick up music too well, I tried playing some music off my phone and it took a bit before it adjusted to pick up the music & even then it was def at a lower volume than my voice even though I literally placed my phone right in front of it. This doesn't really say much if ur playing live instruments though cuz I can't test that.",

                "reviewText": "I used to have a small recording company, so I understand sound equipment and the costs/expectations associated fairly well. This product exceeded my expectations.Given the changes in the world, I have more virtual meetings now. As a result, I've decided to upgrade my desk and decided a budget-friendly mic like this would serve me well. The setup is extremely easy; you just plug it in. Mics like this used to require a separate piece of equipment to make them work, so this is brilliant. I also tested to see if this did work on my phone and how easy that would be. Again, it's simply a plug-in and play. Brilliant.The sound quality is not that of a pro recording studio, but it's PRETTY FANTASTIC! I did not expect much, but this sound is actually really good (for the price). I wouldn't say the range is strong enough to use for vocal/music recordings, but for audio (meetings, gaming, streaming, etc), it's brilliant. Comparing this sound to the wireless phone mics you find; is night and day. This quality is levels above that.Overall, this is a brilliant product & if you are in need of a quality mic at a budget-friendly cost, this is like the mic for you.",
