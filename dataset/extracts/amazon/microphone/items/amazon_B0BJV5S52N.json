                "reviewText": "This isn't the best-made arm I've ever seen... but for the price, it's been pretty hard to beat. It serves my purposes perfectly. I'm using it with a FiFine mic, and I couldn't be happier with the performance from the pair.This keeps my mic completely out of my way until I need it, then it's ready to go at a moment's notice. The cord channels work perfectly and keep the USB cable neatly hidden away. Great buy for light duty and occasional use. If I was going to use it several times daily, I might look for something a bit sturdier, but for me, that would be overkill.The range of motion is fine for what it is... but this arm isn't quite as articulated as others. I knew that going in, and am willing to live with the limitation to get the price I wanted. But because of this, getting the arm positioned on my desk relative to my computer (which is a notebook mounted on another arm) so that I could easily use it took a bit of work, but once I got that figured out, it's worked great. NO complaints at all!",

The only quip I have is that it wobbles a little, nothing severe, and it's almost expected, being so tall with only one point of security at the base, but it isn't so large amount of movement that I'm afraid for my equipment, more of a slight annoyance.Tldr; it's a great item for the price point and does it's job well. I would definitely purchase this again!",

I especially like the cable managing sleeves that are included to hide the microphone cable.But this thing is just TOO stiff. I'm glad it's not flimsy, but when my entire desk flexes just trying to pull it towards my face that's almost an equal and opposite problem.I'm sure there's a way to loosen it up, but trying to do so myself produced less than helpful results. Either way still a great, functional arm. Just be wary that if you're desk is made of particle board you may just snap it in half trying to move this thing around.",

I cannot comment on long term durability yet, but it seems well constructed and is adequately secured to my work desk.",

(cost less as well) This one is sturdy, and stays locked in place once you position it. I can easily swing it left and right to get out of my way when I dont need it with a single finger.Vertical movement is locked in. It will 'rock' up and down if you put your hand on it and intentionally move it. When I do this it will move about an inch up or down, but when you're gaming/streaming and not touching it...it's not going to move. If you're looking for a good value arm this is it. I was considering the elgato boom arm, but why spend more money when this does exactly what I need it to do and it does it well? As a value shopper...this is it. If you need it to say elgato just get a marker and write 'elgato' on it. done.",

We added an office to our workshop and I placed my second computer out there. Needed this to help work with the space a little better than my floor-stand type of mic holder.Love the way you can hide the wires into stand itself. Keeps it looking neat. I do a lot of video recording for content and this looks and works great with my setup. Fantastic purchase. Glad I wasn't cheap and got something else to save money. There is the possibility that I would buy a second one and update my home office with it. I will give this a long term test and see how much I like it. But so far, so good!",

Es un brazo de acero que se nota va a durar mucho m\u00e1s que el que ten\u00eda. Anteriormente adquir\u00ed el paquete de Audio Technica 2035 con su brazo y me dur\u00f3 unos 4 a\u00f1os. Hace un par de d\u00edas desafortunadamente se rompi\u00f3 y decid\u00ed comprar \u00e9ste y vaya sorpresa. Es mucho m\u00e1s fuerte que el de AT y la calidad del material y las piezas es superior en todos los aspectos. El brazo no se mueve tan f\u00e1cilmente pero precisamente eso estaba buscando. Es r\u00edgido y manipulable.Sin embargo, hubo un problema serio: la tuerca para enroscar el micr\u00f3fono no es compatible pues es 5/8 y mi micr\u00f3fono es 1/4. Me dej\u00e9 llevar por el anuncio pues dec\u00eda que era compatible con el AT2035 (y adem\u00e1s en la im\u00e1gen dice que la rosca 5/8 es un \"adaptador\" y supuse que se pod\u00eda quitar para dejarla 1/4) pero no lo es. Desafortunadamente me vi obligado a comprar un adaptador 5/8 a 1/4 adicional y tomar\u00e1 otro par de d\u00edas hasta que pueda utilizar mi micr\u00f3fono.Revisa bien que tu micr\u00f3fono sea 5/8 y no 1/4 como es el est\u00e1ndard para que puedas utilizarlo. Esa es la \u00fanica raz\u00f3n por la que no le doy 5 estrellas. Si no tienes este problema, es el mejor brazo que puedes comprar a este precio.",
