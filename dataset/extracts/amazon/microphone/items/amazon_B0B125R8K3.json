                "reviewText": "I like to dictate my thoughts during my walks to work in the morning, and the standard, built-in microphone in my phone was just not doing the job I needed it to. I had to hold my phone as if I was on a phone call for the app to understand anything I was saying, and even then, words were getting jumbled though I was talking as clearly as I possibly could. It was time to try a lapel mic, so I bought these.I plugged the receiver into my phone via the USB-C slot, pinned on the lapel mic, and got to walking and talking. At first, I couldn't tell if the mic was on at all because I received no indication from my phone that it had been recognized when I plugged it in, but immediately I could tell a difference as I watched my words being transcribed with little to no errors at all. No more holding my phone; I could keep it safely tucked in my pocket as I got my steps in and my words out. This came with two lapel mics, and I immediately charged both of them. So far, though, I have only needed the one because the thing is holding its battery life well. It's nice to have a backup though in case you don't have time to charge one or you need to record for an extended period.The whole thing came in a nice little carrying case, and I keep it stashed in my backpack for easy access when I want to dictate something with my phone. I mainly use this for dictation, but I've recorded some audio of my daughters as they were playing a game, and the sound quality over the standard microphone in my phone was much better. Everything was clearer and there was less background noise.Oh, one feature I didn't know I needed is that the receiver you plug into your USB-C has a USB-C port on the edge so you can still plug a charger into your phone while you are using this. If you need to charge your phone as you record, it's really easy.I would buy this again or recommend it to anyone who needs something simple and effective.",

Great value.Battery life - 2 hours of spoken word. Probably could get more but my mouth's motor starts puttering. Charging is simple and fast.",

But then it suddenly stopped working.The red light on the receiver is on and the the green light on the microphone is on too but no sound is getting recorded. I have tried to unplug it multiple times and test it with different software but no luck. I guess it only has a life of 3 months. In which case it is an expensive buy.",

I feel like I have lived as a cave man not knowing this product is available. After purchasing this I always get compliments from friends of how great my video sounds. This product comes with a little bag so it makes it easier to carry and make sure that you don't lose the parts. I also love that it came with clear instructions. The batter lasts forever I had this for gosh 2months and I only had to charge it once. It also came with a bonus clip and a bonus foam. I would give this product 10 stars if I can. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. It is one of the best business investments that I purchased.",
