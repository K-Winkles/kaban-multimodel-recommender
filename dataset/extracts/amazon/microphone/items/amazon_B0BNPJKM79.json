Bought my oldest son a much better (So I thought) mic for a much larger price tag and bought this one for my youngest son because I couldn't afford to buy them both the expensive one. So, I bought this one for my youngest and he couldn't be happier. His friends/teamates can hear him louder, better and clearer than the mic on his headphones. And when my sons compared them both, the inexpensive one to the more expensive one, they couldn't tell any difference! I should have bought them both the inexpensive one and saved a $100+. Would recommend and if you do purchase, you won't be disappointed! Happy Shopping!",
