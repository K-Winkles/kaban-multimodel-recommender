                "reviewText": "I really like this lavalier microphone as the sound quality it provides is excellent. I am using this Lavalier With The Fulaim X5 Wireless Lavalier System and have been extremely pleased with the sound quality delivered by this pairing. My only criticism of this lavalier is that it is setup to be horizontally worn on the body (as you'll see in the product photos). This certainly doesn't detract in any way from the microphone which is why I did not lower my rating because of it. Rather, from an aesthetics perspective, it is my personal preference to have a lavalier that is laterally worn. This can be accomplished with the Sony Lavalier (which is how I use it) and it does not detract from the sound quality; however, in wearing it in this way it would probably seem slightly larger than other comparable external microphones. Regardless, for a sub $50 microphone, it really is quite a good value for excellent sound quality.",

My major gripes with this product are the very short 1-meter-long cable, and the poor clamping pressure the clip exerts on my clothes or other objects. I ended up zip-tying the microphone cable to my computer's headphone cable, to get that added rigidity and to bypass that annoyingly small and flimsy clamp.Edit: After two years, I realized the range of this mic isn't very good. In meetings, I'm not heard very well. Got tired of holding the mic next to my mouth. Ended up switching to my webcam microphone.",

Using it is a breeze; simply plug it in, and you're good to go.The audio signal it produces is remarkably clean and free from any annoying noise.The microphone captures clear, crisp sound, making it a perfect choice for interviews, vlogs, and various recording scenarios.For the price, it's an outstanding performer, and I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable and budget-friendly lavalier microphone. Definitely swings above its weight class.",

Any slight movement of its cable will be clearly heard in the recording. So unless you spend the time to properly isolate this microphone the recording will be full of obnoxious rustling noises.",

                "reviewText": "Right off the bat, I know some people are going to complain that the cord is too short. Two things:- if clipping it to your shirt/jacket and plugging into a camera you're using for vlogging handheld, this is the perfect length of cord: Not too long to trip over and not so short that it's going to dangle.- If recording to an external audio device, be it a transmitter or a handheld thing like a Zoom F1 that you're keeping in your pocket, it's again the perfect length.If you need a longer cord, any of the headphone extension cables found on Amazon work perfectly fine (which I've also used when in a studio streaming setup).The clarity and sound quality out of this stereo mic is perfect, and if you're going to only record mono, just turn it so that the left channel is facing upwards. I love the ability to turn it in multiple directions depending on the side of jacket I'm wearing it on.",
