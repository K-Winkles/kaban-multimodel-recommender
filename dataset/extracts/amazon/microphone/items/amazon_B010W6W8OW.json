It was possible to leave intact the top edge over the Lightning connector--unlike some cases with an open area there to I\u2019ve used the MV88 for live music performance video recording in stereo, with a handheld iPhone 6s Plus since Dec2015. As of 04Jul2017 there is no competition for this application. As a musician and software engineer coding audio signal processing, I\u2019ve found the sound quality to be excellent. Amazing lows and clear, extended natural highs vs. mics like the Zoom iQ7 and the old Tascam iM2. Amazon apparently doesn\u2019t allow external links, but google \u201cyoutube electric eye lucky strike\u201d should yield two videos of the same performance, with audio from the Zoom iQ7 vs. the MV88.There are other great stereo mics from Shure and Rode, but they're significantly bulkier and heavier\u2014impractical for handheld video.\ufeff And there is no contest vs the mono, overload prone built-in iPhone mics\u2014optimized for noise cancellation and monaural voice, rather than stereo live music. You may burst out laughing hearing recordings with the MV88 for the first time. Commenters saying there is little or no difference\u2014maybe are listening on the iPhone speaker? Headphones, external speakers, are the real test.The MOTIV app is easy to use. Documentation is a joy\u2014clear and detailed, often answering not just how, but why. Its Band preset works amazingly well for rock concerts\u2014just a touch of compression and limiting, to the point i\u2019ve never heard distortion on live performances, other than traceable to overloaded mixer/monitor/amps in the original performance. Even on video of Motley Crue\u2019s Final Tour 31Dec2015, the explosions weren\u2019t distorted (google youtube motley crue antera77, at 27:42)The highly elegant pivot and twist system for the stereo mics gives correctly oriented stereo audio for landscape mode (\u201chorizontal\u201d) video. Mics like the Rode iXYL and the apparently abandoned Blue Mikey Digital Lightning (Blue\u2019s website as of 04Jul2017 touts iOS 7 compatibility\u2014a version introduced Sep2013) require portrait mode for this\u2014rendering them essentially useless for landscape mode video. The jewel-like, all metal construction screams quality, vs. plasticy, deformed Mickey Mouse ears looking mics like the Zoom iQ7.Suggested improvements, 0-10 scale, 10 being highest priority/cost:10/10: Recording level indication on the mic - add two or three green LED level meters to the single MV88 \u201cCommunication Established\u201d LED.My biggest disappointments have involved not knowing audio levels while recording video. Excellent workaround has been an iOS video app like Filmic Pro with on-screen audio level meters. Apple\u2019s default Camera app has none\u2014suggestion to Apple: Make audio level meters a Preferences-selectable option! Much less elegant workaround: carry earbuds or headphones to the live show to monitor the audio. Earbuds are hard to hear in a live music setting, and more bulk and kit to lose and fuss with\u2014especially with iPhone 7 and newer needing an adapter for headphones.The $100 Zoom iQ7 Lightning mic has three LED level meters, so they\u2019re likely cost-effective.4/10: \u201cTurn Airplane Mode On When MV88 detected\u201d option in the Shure MOTIV appI\u2019ve come home to interference-riddled audio several times, because I forgot to turn Airplane Mode on. No reliable way to tell if interference is occurring while taking video, even with an audio level meter-equipped video app like Filmic Pro.You wouldn\u2019t want Airplane Mode automatic:* not clear that iOS would allow this* some would like to do live streaming, and/or to take calls while recording even if it interrupts the video app3/10: Improve software system reliability in establishing MV88 communicationI don\u2019t know if this is practical. But I\u2019ve had big disappointments from not paying attention to the MV88 green LED. Not noticing the serial data connection wasn\u2019t established meant the horrible, built in mono iPhone mic took over, or worse, no audio. Even using an audio level meter equipped app like Filmic Pro, sometimes I haven\u2019t noticed if the on-screen audio meters were showing stereo vs. mono, or no audio. Apparently it\u2019s fairly common even with the MV88 plugged into the Lightning connector, that a serial data connection is not established. Understandable given several systems have to interact perfectly:* mechanical Lightning connection* three software systems\u2014iOS, video app, Shure MOTIV appThe ideal live music recorder would be a dedicated video camera and permanently attached stereo mic and integrated software. It may be that Shure has already maximized communication reliability, given the constraints of integrating with the iPhone hardware and software.1/10: Add RFID\u2014MV88 is so tiny, it\u2019s easy to lose!A passive 916MHz RFID tag would add an insignificant $0.15 (in volume as of 2006) to the $150 cost. You\u2019ve got the radio hardware to sent out RFID signals right there on the iPhone. Most practical would be just a response\u2014tells you the MV88 is in the room somewhere at least, vs. lost at the gig. GPS chips and a beeper in the MV88 would be nice, but almost certainly not cost effective. Source: wikipedia RFID.\u2014\u2014I\u2019d like to address the remainder of this review to errors in the review \u201cNot $150 worth of mic, just ok.By Amazon Customer #99 on March 7, 2017\u201d, as these are common misunderstandings that could dissuade many from making an excellent choice in the MV88:\u201cBottom line: It's good but, frustratingly, not $150 good\u2026Zoom makes one\u2026at least as good for\u2026less.\u201dI disagree completely. Superior performance, build quality and features are well worth $150 vs competition like the $100 Zoom iQ7. This is generally echoed by the majority of other reviews here.\u201c \u201cIt's fine for speech and podcasts and YouTube videos, but not really good enough for a musician. It is noticeably noisy (hissy)\u2026\u201dFor conversations, and live music performances at least, avoiding distortion and overload, is far more important than background hiss\u2014a comparative non-issue. As a musician and audio engineer, I\u2019ve found the MV88 audio excellent\u2014extended bass and highs, and if there\u2019s any distortion, it\u2019s been from overdriven mixers/monitors/amps in the original performance. On quiet passages, audience noise has been more an issue than background hiss.From Shure:\u201cThe MV88 was designed primarily to record loud sounds, like a rock concert, or medium sounds, such as conversation. As the sounds gets softer and/or the MV88 is placed farther away from the sound source, at some point the self-noise (hiss level) of the MV88 might become noticeable or objectionable\u2026The MV88 does not have an exceptionally low noise floor like a Shure KSM44A (4 dB SPL-A), however the KSM44A is nearly seven times the price. If the requirement is to record very soft bird sounds in a forest, or the barely audible whispers of wind in the trees, the MV88 may not be appropriate.\u201d (google Shure Customer Help MV88 recording soft sounds)Further, the biggest source of background hiss is presets with Compression on, rather than quiescent mic capsule noise. Turning it off or using Flat preset in the MOTIV app will help. Just be careful to set recording levels low enough to prevent overload.\u201c\u2026even when the phone is in airplane mode.\u201dAirplane mode being off, and microphone signal-to-noise performance are two different noise sources. Airplane mode turns off the iPhone cellular/Bluetooth/wifi radio frequency transmit and receive, which can cause static and other intermittent noise at audio frequencies. This has nothing to do with steady background hiss from the MV88 ADC and mic capsules\u2019 combined signal to noise ratio.\u201c It has weak midrange and bass response\u2026\u201cCompared to what? I\u2019ve found the MV88 to have excellent bass response vs other Lightning connector mics like the iQ7. Shure\u2019s User Guide lists response as 20-20kHz. Its frequency response graph shows a gentle rolloff below 300Hz but no dip in the midrange:(From Shure MV88 User Guide - Specifications)You may be comparing the MV88 to a mic with artificially boosted midrange and bass.\u201c\u2026 although it's tweakable in the MOTIV app up to a point.\u201dIndeed it is, with the MOTIV 5-band graphic EQ:(From Shure MV88 User Guide - The ShurePlus MOTIV App - Mic setup)\u201cIt is heavy and cumbersome unless you hold the phone\u2026on a tripod.\u201dMaybe if you\u2019re a leprechaun. The MV88 mass is 40.5g vs. your favored Zoom iQ7 at 30.5g. Using the MV88 handheld for shooting live music performances with my 192g iPhone 6s Plus and approx 24g Incase Halo Snap case increases the mass as a unit by about 20%. Or the mass vs. using the iQ7 by about 4.1%.(192+24+41)/(192+24).(192+24+41)/(192+24+31)Claiming a 4% increase in mass would push an iPhone-plus-mic into tripod territory is baffling.\u201cIt won't work with many cases\u2026\u201dIt fits Apple, and some Incase cases. Making sure your case provides clearance around the Lightning connector is a reasonable tradeoff to get the excellent MV88 features. Shure also addresses this: (google Shure Customer Help MV88 use with a phone case)\u201cAlesis and Rode make better ones.\u201dAs of Jul2017:* The RODE iXY-L orients its stereo mics incorrectly for landscape mode video. This can outweigh possibly better sound* Alesis lists no mics on its website\u201cIt\u2019s an improvement over built in DAC/mic but not a huge improvement.\u201dDAC (digital to analog conversion) is irrelevant to an analog audio source like a microphone. You might be thinking of analog to digital conversion (ADC).\u201cAn iPhone really needs a full outboard DAC to record decently. This seems to share\u2026\u201dYou seem to be suggesting the MV88 relies on an iPhone internal digital to analog converter (DAC). If so, this is false.Again, digital to analog conversion\u2014outboard or otherwise\u2014is irrelevant to an analog audio source like a microphone. You might be thinking of analog to digital conversion (ADC). This is necessarily done by the MV88, since the iPhone Lightning connector has no analog data signals. It only has pins for a serial digital data stream. That is, the MV88 indeed has an ADC \u201coutboard\u201d from the iPhone.(Wikipedia Lightning Connector)",

                "reviewText": "I was using a Rode Video Mic on my Micro Four Thirds camera, a Panasonic GX8. However, I was frustrated by the very narrow sound window, and lack of stereo sound, and it wasn't exactly travel friendly either.I also use my phone when there is enough light. So I wanted something that worked with everything. It turned out that the MV88+ works well with Phones, Cameras, and Laptops.As a phone mic it works amazingly well. You can alter the stereo width, set it to a narrow mono, side channel, you name it. The video and audio apps from Shure work well. The mic also works with any other app on the phone without issues. The dynamic range is great, pick up the smallest sounds, and loudest thunder without clipping. When set to wide stereo there is a great sense of presence when you listen back to the audio on headphones.You can use this as a SLR/Mirror-less video microphone also. All I had to do was calibrate the input level on my camera and the headphone output until the levels were correct. With the right adapter cables, it even works in stereo on the Panasonic GX8. The microphone saves its setting even when not connected to a phone. And the headphone output works, even when the microphone is only connected to a USB battery power pack. There is no latency on the headphone output.It also works well on laptops and desktops as a USB microphone. You do still have to connect it to a phone to alter any settings. Note it works with a normal USB-A to Micro cable on Windows, no need for USB-C if you don't have it.The whole kit stores in a wrap that unrolls into a flat set of five pockets. There are also elastic straps on the outside that work to hold the mini-tripod. When warped up, it takes up about as much space as tall coffee mug. It is very portable and easy to setup.The phone kit consists of a Manfrotto brand clamp and tripod. The phone clamp is good, but there is no spring action, so your phone is held only by how tight you can get the knob. The good news is the top is a cold-shoe, and the bottom is a 1/4-20 thread, so you can replace the whole clamp with something better if you want.The tripod is high quality. It has a easy release button, and stays when you put it. You can attach the microphone directly to it, without the phone clamp, to make it into a traditional desktop microphone.The arm holding the microphone is a simple clamp, but holds the microphone very tightly. It has a 1/4-20 thread at the base, and a cold shoe attachment that works great on a SLR/Mirroless camera. The microphone body itself appears to be compatible with other traditional microphone grips.The foam ball on the end of the mic can be pulled off, making the profile even smaller where wind isn't a concern. It is still quite small even with a Movo WS-G10 Furry windscreen added.The overall construction of the microphone, and included accessories is top notch. The microphone appears to be all metal. The included cables are sturdy, however they are short. You can use a USB-Micro extension cable to get more distance, even when using the Lightning cable.",
