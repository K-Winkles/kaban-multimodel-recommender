The quality and the included peripherals, from lav mics to charging case, etc., Rode provides the biggest value for the investment. Very well done!What\u2019s missing? Depending on your need, the time-code function, which is already a headache to use, does not work when you shoot video at 120 fps. At least not that I have found a way to configure. Why would you need that? You don\u2019t\u2026until you film with the intention to edit for slow-mo(tion) post edits. Is this a major limitation? Not really, but it means that you have a little more work in post. Not the biggest of annoyances, BUT, it would have been nice for Rode to state the limitations. For me, as someone who films fast sports while \u201ctalking about it\u201d, this is a bit of a downer and has me considering whether I should return the set. Difficult decision, because the rest is darn good!Why 5-stars instead of 4?Because the limitation is so minor, that it really is mostly a nit-picky annoyance with Rode\u2019s inability/unwillingness to clearly state what can and cannot be accomplished with your $400+ investment. Sure, sales spin and omissions are strategic, yet, I\u2019d expect better from Rode.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars These are great wireless accordion microphones",
                "reviewText": "These work as accordion mics! Decent external wireless pickup mics for accordions are hard to find. Even though these are intended as lapel mics, they do the trick and sound good.The fact that the two transmitters go to a single receiver which requires no external power source is super convenient for many performance situations. You can use these with a battery powered amp/speaker and amplify your accordion wirelessly without requiring an electrical outlet at all \u2013 ideal for busking. The transmitters have a long range and can be used in strolling performances. In most cases, you will need an eighth inch to quarter inch adapter.For the keyboard side on a piano accordion, use velcro tape to attach one of the transmitters to the lower part of the grille, with the microphone pointing upwards. The high notes will be louder than the lower notes, but overall, the volume will sound more stable over the range of the keyboard than it would if you were to put the transmitter at the top facing down, or in the middle facing toward the keyboard.On the button side, thread a velcro strap through the clip of the other transmitter and strap it to the outer side of the bass strap, so the microphone is pointing upwards. Cut the velcro strap to shorten it if needed so it fits snugly around the bass strap.If you can find a black acrylic paint pen, I recommend painting over the blue lights on the transmitters; you\u2019ll still be able to see the lights to know whether the transmitters are connecting, but they\u2019ll be less glaringly bright on stage.You can use these mics for recording also, but it would only make sense to do so in a live performance setting. For studio recording, it would make more sense to use stationary mics.There are a few limitations to be aware of:1) You cannot adjust the input gain, only the output gain. If there is noticeable distortion, there is no way to turn down the input gain, you\u2019ll have to find a way to mount the transmitters differently. When I play on the bass side, the receiver indicates that there is some distortion, but it\u2019s subtle enough that it probably wouldn\u2019t be noticed in a performance setting. The sound quality is actually quite good.2) You cannot adjust the volume of the two mics independently. If the keyboard side is too quiet, the only options are to mess with the EQ on the amp/speaker/mixer or to try adjusting the mic placement.3) These mics are omnidirectional, which I think is idea for this kind of setup, but you\u2019ll have to be extra careful about feedback issues.I only just finished setting up and testing these mics, with guidance from a sound engineer friend. haven\u2019t used them in performance yet. I will update this review if I encounter any issues. So far they seem like a great option for accordionists to know about.",

I have to say that Rode's response was positive and they sent me a couple of spare parts.But it took him two weeks or more to get the new clips and I'm afraid they might break again at any moment.I recommend the product, but it would be nice to buy the Rode metal clips. This shouldn't have to happen with a $400 device.",
