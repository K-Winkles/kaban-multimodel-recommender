How does this microphone capture my voice? This top-address microphone captures sound directly in front of it using its diaphragm located at the top of the capsule, converting sound waves into an electrical signal. It's ideal for clear and focused sound capture in a studio setting. Does this microphone work with Android phones? Sure, it's compatiable with Android phones through the included TYPE-C ADAPTER. And ensure Your Android Device Supports OTG and make sure it's enabled before use, or Activate OTG as Needed. Does this pink microphone work with an iPad? This microphone includes a USB adapter for iPhone that allows it to be compatible with iPhone 5 onwards and iPad 4 onwards. Is the mic compatible with the Mac book? The microphone is fully compatible with Macbook and doesn't need any extra drivers. Please check your Mac settings to ensure that the microphone is recognized as an input source.",

Just loosen the knobs on either end and swivel to your desired position. I don\u2019t know how it will handle prolonged use or if the quality will stand up over time but right now I couldn\u2019t ask for more. Especially at this price point. Under $50. I\u2019ve used one of the \u201cbrand name\u201d mics that was over $100 and it couldn\u2019t even connect to a computer half of the time. So happy with this purchase.",
