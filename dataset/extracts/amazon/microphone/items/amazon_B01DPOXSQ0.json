                "reviewText": "If you want a heavy weighted mic stand then it's good. The microphone snaps and pops once XLR is plugged in. I used a better grade XLR, same issue. It's a prop mic really. The swivel part of the stand only really works if you secure the base to the floor or stand on it. If you plan on taking this out for performances, I don't think venues will let you attach it to their stage :) I bought for my kids to play with so I guess it's ok for that. Using my own mic.",
