                "reviewText": "This is actually a pro\u2013sounding mic and at an amazing price. Imagine a Shure SM58 at a third of the cost but housed in plastic instead of metal. I did a side-by-side comparison with this mic and a Shure SM58. To my ears, which are pretty sensitive, the two mics sounded identical on vocals (male with range from low F to high G), and I actually preferred it over the SM-58 for an acoustic guitar and acoustic bass. Sorry I didn\u2019t do electrics because I only have a dinky practice amp.I think the trade-off for the low price is in the material. An SM58 is nigh\u2013indestructible, able to take insane forms of abuse from high impacts to freezing, and even cooking. This mic, on the other hand, is a light, rigid plastic of some kind. My initial impressions were just don\u2019t drop it on the floor or anything like that and you\u2019ll be fine, as long as it\u2019s handled carefully. However, the threads for mounting to a stand are also plastic, and I do wonder how long the plastic threads will endure their job without wear. I\u2019ve had no such problems yet, though. If one only uses stands compatible with the metal adapter (included), this should not be a concern.Contrary to amateur complaints\u2026THIS MICROPHONE HAS NO PROBLEMS WITH BUZZ OR RADIO FREQUENCY INTERFERENCE.Any such problems come from the CABLE, not from the microphone.The cable included with this microphone is just a bonus; it is of poor quality and not suitable for serious use. Always use a low-impedance (XLR) cable to avoid such problems. No microphone in the world can guarantee a signal free of unwanted interference if it is connected to a cheap high-impedance cable like the one included here. Toss the cable, keep the mic.This is an amazing\u2013sounding dynamic microphone for home/studio use and at very low price; just handle it gently.Oh, and it does look really cool. The photos are accurate.Wishing everyone good health.",

However, although it looks like a vintage chrome mic, the outside is actually a chromed plastic, so you must be gentle with it. Great value, low price, good sound.",

                "reviewText": "Pyle PDMICR42R offers a classic, retro-style like feel to live recordings and events that will surely please the average audiophile. The CR42 is very sturdy and has a quality build for its simplistic yet premium design. Simply, the mic is built to last. The best feature by far is its built-in pop filter that reduces the popping sound. Awhile I love this feature, I would reluctantly still find myself using an additional filter for subtle differences in hearing Ps and Bs throughout a recording. Nonetheless, It's a matter of choice and preference as there would be certain variances often plagued by the additional recording equipment I was using. It's not big on the diaphragm, but this is not what the mic's use is intended for, obviously. Moreover, the mic holds true to its wide frequency and its unidirectional sensitivity ensuring clear crystal audio. Truly one of the best mic's on the market.",

Get a more durable (even if not as trendy) backup. Also: get a pop-filter of your choice.",

The sound of the microphone is top notch!!!",

First thing, you got to sing into the very front. If you dont then you dont get the sound response. That's normal for this style of mic.Second thing, the plastic is a good thing not a bad thing. I also have the real old shure 55 mic like elvis used and it's so heavy it makes the boom on the stand drop unless you overtighten it but then the mic stand is ruined. Plus it makes the mic stand want to tip over. The light plastic is way more practical especially on stage.Do use with a mixer that has 3 band eq.Dont use as a podcast mic.My review isnt to educate you on why, just do and dont.",
