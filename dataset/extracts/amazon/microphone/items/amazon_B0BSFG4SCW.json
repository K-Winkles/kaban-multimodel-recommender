It sounds nice had good features. You can plug headphone into the mic to get the sound before your processing. XLR or USB makes it very useful. I have it plugged into my pc for simple recording and into a mixer when I have more mics. The software is good, I wish it had a few other features but it has everything it needs, EQ, etc. I would definitely buy another.",

                "reviewText": "Coming from a fifine 40$ mic that i bought years ago, for the $75 I paid when it wasn\u2019t on sale was a great deal. It sounds full and clearer then my other usb mic and my friends could instantly tell a difference.*important note: if your XLR this mic the program does not work nor does the headset feedback, these are usb only features*It has option for XLR, which I will be trying out in the future with fifins new XLR interface, But for USB it\u2019s more then enough for even a YouTuber with some adjusting. I do use this for my own videos and it\u2019s sound clarity and quality is above its price point. Also it\u2019s recommended to talk into the top of the mix not the sides. The way this capsule is designed your best sound quality is from the top.The program works well and isn\u2019t sloppy like I thought it would be. It\u2019s well put together with intuitive design and lay outs. You can mute your mic, Change your RgB color and brightness form it and even have advanced options for mic sound adjustment like EQ (tip: they don\u2019t work that well your better off leaving it alone).The mute button feels good and is clicky but not cheap clicky , it feels premium.Cons:The RGb button on the bottom of the mic is hard to press in to activate and it\u2019s in a weird spot so I\u2019d recommend using the program for the mic which you can also adjust all rgb settings like color and brightness within it.The \u201cgains\u201d dial on the mic is also pretty \u201cmeh\u201d with no Phyisical markings on it so it\u2019s hard to tell how much gain your at. I\u2019d recommend messing with your \u201cgain\u201d setting in the program as well. In fact I recommend using this mic pretty much entirely off the app itself and not the mic itself.A negative about the mic is when you turn your computer off your rgb stays on so you\u2019ll need to use the button or turn it off in the app before turning off your computer.The ring that holds the mic does feel cheap. the mic itself feels and looks premium but the ring is this ugly glossy plastic that looks like it\u2019s where a lot of the cost cutting was at.The last con is the buttons and dials on the mic. Your RGb is on the bottom which you can\u2019t get to and your gain and mute button become impossible to see when your talking into the top of the mic. This is a preference thing but just be mindful of this when your pick out your mics, with this one you\u2019ll have a hard time controlling it from the mic if your not using an XLR or the app to control its settings which seems like how it was mostly intended to be used anyways.",

After some research I came across this mic and it fit the bill perfectly!It\u2019s pretty much plug n play and if you wanna download the software for it it\u2019s pretty good too. You can adjust things like gain, vocal pattern, limiter and other stuff, no settings for highs, mids, and lows but that\u2019s to be expected at this price point tbh. Friends say it\u2019s def an upgrade compared to my previous mic though!There\u2019s a 3.5mm headphone Jack built into the back of the mic for your headphones and a mute button on it too (on the mic) it turns red when you\u2019re muted to that\u2019s pretty cool and you can turn on mic monitoring to make sure everything sounds good.Got options for usb connection (usb c and it has an adapter for standard usb connection) AND it\u2019s got XLR connection in case I do want to buy a preamp to hook it up to. Curious to see what the quality would be like using that instead of the usb connection but even with usb it sounds really clear!All in all, I would recommend this to anyone on a budget looking to buy something that\u2019s great quality but not wanting to break the bank.",

                "reviewText": "I've had a couple of Maono audio products and have been impressed at the quality each time, so I'm pleased to find that it's also the case with this quality podcast mic. For a start, they have their broad target audience understood, with both the studio-style XLR socket as well as a USB-C one for laptop-based setups. It's the USB-C one I was using, and although a USB-C to USB-A cable is provided, I used it without any issues with a USB-C to USB-C too (note - no XLR cable included).It's beautifully crafted, with a solid, quality-feel chassis for the mic that has a decent weight to it, which also houses the volume/gain/mute controls. Impressively, there's also a 3.5mm jack output for monitoring direct from the mic, which is a huge bonus if you're socket-short, or using a slower/older laptop. Most importantly, pickup on it is superb for spoken voice, with a crisp, clear vocal when I recorded via the mic in GarageBand.Top top it all off, it makes a very cool-looking addition to a home studio setup with the LED back-lighting on the controls, all controllable via the button on the base.It's another expert piece of audio kit from Maono, which adds a pro touch to a home podcasting rig - heartily recommend it for hobbyists and semi-professionals alike.",
