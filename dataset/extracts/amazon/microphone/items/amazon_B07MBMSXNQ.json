But you should know before buying that this is a plastic echo mic so you won't get a professional echo to begin with. I bought this because its basically a plastic microphone and fits the aethetic. Know that it won't work very well if you are not projecting. My advice, if it doesn't really work is hold the mic really close and talk loud. The rattle thing is removable which is a plus and the light up switch is what makes this thing different and more worth it than the rest. Will update on how it goes being used for my funny little \"mc\" idea~",
