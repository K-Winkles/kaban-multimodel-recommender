The microphone's base is surprisingly heavy and has a very effective, non-slip coating on the bottom. So I'm not concerned about this microphone tipping over or sliding off my desk.I installed this on my Windows 11 machine for voice recording and virtual meetings. I appreciate that it is plug-in-play with no software required.Sound Quality: Awesome. I captured a voice recording where I spoke softly, and then loudly with lots of P-words. The sound was crystal clear and the pop filter was extremely effective on all of my P-words.For the price, this microphone is an amazing value!",

                "reviewText": "Upon opening the microphone box everything was packed in thick foam and protected very well which I liked, the stand was heavier than I expected which was nice and everything has a very good build quality feel. The instructions made it easy to assemble and connect to my PC, I used it first on discord with some friends who said the sound quality was very good and clear sounding. After that I used an audio recording software to compare the lows, mids and highs against the boom microphone on my Sennheiser head set. While using default audio settings the Amcrest AM430-PS microphone had a more even sound profile from low to high where my boom microphone was more on the high pitch side, I also tried to speak as quietly as I could to see if either microphone could pick it up and the AM430-PS surprised me with being able to pick up my voice when I could barely hear it myself. Overall I think this is a nice microphone and with some audio tuning it could be a very good for podcasts, streaming or VODs and if a friend is looking for a reasonable priced good quality microphone I will point them to the AM430-PS from Amcrest.",

                "reviewText": "Here is what I thought about this microphone:Marketing:I looked at various offerings for podcast-style microphones on Amazon and found that Amcrest did a good job on the write-up of this product there. There is a lot of good information about the product in the Amazon listing, arguably far more than is included with the purchased product. Everything that is written on Amazon should also be in the product manual.Packaging:I found the overall packaging to be good. I purchased the microphone from Amazon and did not notice the options to ship in the OEM box or in an Amazon package, so mine came in the OEM box; there were shipping labels directly on the top of the box which obscured the graphics and description of the microphone. Not a big deal, but if this makes a difference to you, be advised that it is an option, and the default was to ship it in the OEM box. Regarding durability, the box was a little dirty from moving through the USPS system but undamaged otherwise. The contents of the box were smartly organized in foam to maximize space while providing good protection for all the pieces.Assembly:Assembling the microphone stand, filter and microphone was very easy. The included manual has assembly instructions that are easy to understand. However, the instructions correctly state to screw the stand tube clockwise into the base, but the arrow in the graphic appears to indicate a counterclockwise direction. Care needs to be taken that you do not cross thread it as it has a fine thread and is a little difficult to get started. But once it is screwed in securely it is solid. The base is 4\u201d in diameter and has some weight to it, but I found once I had the microphone and filter attached and the adjustable stand extended to its top-most position, it was a little top heavy and if things are not well balanced on the stand it could tip over on its own. I made some minor adjustments to how and where I attached the filter and twisted it around so that it helped with the balance issue, but I would like to see the base either a little larger or a little heavier to alleviate any balance issues. It is probably only an issue with the stand extended but I am tall, so I need it fully extended. And while the filter was easy to attach to the stand, it is only by looking at the picture on the box or the front of the user manual that you know how to attach it, as there is nothing about it in the assembly instructions. The last thing I will mention is that there was a threaded collar in the box that was not attached to anything and there is no mention of it anywhere in the manual. I figured out quickly that it just screwed into the bottom of the microphone, but I was not sure of the orientation. I finally decided that putting it on narrow side out did a better job of hiding the USB connector. It was just strange that it was not mentioned in the parts list or in the assembly instructions; perhaps it is removeable if you are using some other type of stand.Quality:This part can be subjective as I am not a professional podcaster or radio DJ but based on what I paid for this set, I think the overall quality both in its design and sound production is very good. It was truly plug and play and my computers recognized it just fine. On the picky side, it just shows up (Windows 11) as a USB PnP Audio Device. It would be nice if Amcrest branded the driver so it showed up as Amcrest USB Cardioid Microphone. Again, just being picky.Warranty:The side of the box the microphone came in states Limited Warranty but there is no mention of the warranty anywhere else; no separate warranty card either. And Amazon just says to contact the manufacturer for warranty information. That is not good enough in my opinion. Amcrest needs to be upfront about their product\u2019s quality by providing clear warranty information.Finishing thoughts:This is a good microphone for what it is designed for, as other reviews on Amazon agree with, and a lot of bang for the buck. Sure, other microphones costing hundreds or more will outperform this one, but most users will not need any more than this microphone setup will provide. If you need one with an articulating arm instead of a stand base, Amcrest also sells that type. I\u2019ll give this a 4.5/5; Amcrest just needs to improve a few minor details previously outlined here. And, full disclosure, I have several of Amcrest's security cameras and I find overall a similar pattern with this brand \u2013 a good quality product, lacking in the area of documentation/instructions; the same could be said about other brands as well, I am just familiar with Amcrest.",
