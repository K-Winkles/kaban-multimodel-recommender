I did a test or two with it and found that it works pretty well with my DSLR camera and with my phone (type C). The mic is sensitive, it picks up a lot and works pretty well from a distance. I did have some crackling and humming to begin with, but I think it's because I was holding onto it and fumbling it around. Once I tested when the mic was standing still untouched my results were much better.",
