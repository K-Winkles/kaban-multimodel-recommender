My methodology for Vine Program products is to give a more thorough -- often product-destructive -- review. If I like the product, I buy my own version of it, otherwise, it gets donated post-testing. I may include my opinion on the product's value proposition to the market.REVIEW:--------------------------------This is a decent quality microphone that you might use for small gatherings or karaoke in your garage. It has a very basic transmitter setup, and quality will be what you should expect at this price point, meaning that anything on the edge of the audio frequency spectrum might not be reproduced very well.Build quality is okay, but not high-grade, and I would not expect this thing to stand up to any level of abuse or frequent use. The battery cell is a generic 18650 cell that is common in many rechargeable electronics these days, it is replaceable, and pops in/out so that is one thing you can upgrade if you find it doesn't last very long for your needs.END NOTE:--------------------------------And with all the reviews I do, if there's ever a problem with this product, I will edit (if able) to update this review. These will be denoted in an \"UPDATES\" section.",

No help at all and wouldn't give me the phone number to troubleshoot. There is no volumn control and barely makes any sound at all.

                "reviewText": "I wanted to like these. I really did. My current set of wireless karaoke mics need AA batteries swapped in often, and the receiver is a sizable box (larger than my speaker amp, actually). These have everything I\u2019ve wanted in a wireless mic set: a compact receiver with good reception over a decent distance, rechargeable without some proprietary connector/charging cable (everything is rechargeable with a USB Type-C connector), support for 2 mics on one 1/4\" input to my amp, even replaceable rechargeable batteries! This set should be absolutely amazing!However, it has one flaw that means I\u2019m unlikely to use it: whenever anything low-frequency goes into the mic (singing or speaking with any sort of bass, or tapping the mic, whether intentionally or not, and not even on the tip \u2013 even the sides of the mic, while holding it, will do the trick) causes a VERY audible crackling noise to accompany the audio. I don\u2019t know if this is a side-effect of the \u201caudio reference companding\u201d that the box mentions over and over, but it makes it unusable for me as a karaoke mic. (FYI, \u201ccompanding\u201d is a real term, meaning compressing + expanding, and could account for frequency-specific issues like what I\u2019m hearing from these. It is usually a good thing, when implemented well, but in this case, the low end seems to have some issue.) It's possible that the mics are aggressively trying to separate noise from voice, but if that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s not doing a good job of it. Certainly not the quality you\u2019d get from higher end mics, but you get what you pay for.The listing mentions XLR and \u201ccorded electric\u201d power \u2013 the only time you have corded electric power is when charging these \u2013 they\u2019re wireless\u2026The microphones claim to be using frequencies in the 700-800MHz range\u2026 which may also interfere with LTE/5G, so that could be a concern as well. I haven\u2019t looked at it in great detail, and I don\u2019t have a spectrum analyzer to confirm that those frequencies are indeed being used, but I do know that some companies selling wireless mics have had to reduce the number of frequencies that they operate in due to LTE/5G band acquisitions in the USA, and I suspect the 700-800MHz range may be dicey to run these in. Hopefully the FCC doesn\u2019t come knocking on our door\u2026I may give these a try in some other locations, just to see if what I\u2019m encountering with the sound quality is due to some localized interference\u2026 but I really kind of doubt it, since it doesn\u2019t seem to occur when my wife or son speak into it, so it seems to be something to do with lower vocal frequencies getting clipped. If there\u2019s a way to fix that, then I\u2019d love these things!All in all, these work to some degree, and I have no way to tell if the issues I have are one-off issues or not. For some people, these may work just fine (especially if your voice is higher than mine, apparently). But for me, I guess I'd better stock up on AA batteries and hold onto my old set of mics. I'll keep these around for karaoke nights and hand them to the ladies.",
