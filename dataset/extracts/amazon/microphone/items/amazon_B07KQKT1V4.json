They are so good, that one of the clubs I DJ at even bought them.I highly recommend!",

I love it so much I ordered 2 more and they work great. I play classic country and it is so much easier with no mic cords. The batteries lasted two, 4 hour jobs. You need to buy bigger mic holders. These mics are much larger than regular mics. Great for the price. I only have the volume set on number 2 and master on on 3 and that is loud enough for us. We don\u2019t play loud so they work great for us. ",

Never once have I encountered interference from outside sources. Range has been just fine. They work as they should from the other side of a large room. Mine is mounted under my controller inside a flight case. These are much better than the cheaper ones and compare more to Shure. As one of the top DJs in my area, I need quality, and these meet the expectations of my clients.",

Initially I thought I'd never find a decent enough wireless set in the budget I had, but GTD came through.Yes, they are cheap and the build quality isn't up to the standards of professional brands, but if you're putting it in a rack and not moving it, I don't feel like you can beat these. They have every feature you'd expect on units many times as expensive.Very intuitive to use if you're familiar with modern wireless at all. Good sound quality, EXCELLENT transmission range and good battery life in the handsets.I also have to commend GTD on their customer service. My initial unit was defective (one of the receivers would not pair with the handheld). I sent them one email and they had a replacement receiver on the way that day. I've since ordered some accessories directly from GTD and got very fast service as well.",

However I sold everything but put together a small DJ rig for a few of the community events we do each year. I wanted a wireless mic for the rig and decided a Shure wireless mic was too much $$$ for the 3 or 4 times a yr it gets used, And its not for band use either. I found this setup and it had great reviews, so I went with it. I am amazed how well it works. Out of the box, I mounted the receiver in the rack and put batteries in the mics and turned them on and away we go! The range is awesome and the signal is very clear. There was no feedback while walking in front of the mains and i never had to do any EQ'ing of the mics. They were that clear! If you're on a budget or you do karaoke, these are the ticket!!",

I could not ask for more from a product at this price point. Everything about this (build quality, microphones, antenna\u2019s and the receiver) are well made and operates better than I expected. I purchased these after trying two or three others which were returned quickly after I received them because they were faulty or defective.So happy that I stumbled onto these and expect to have them for quite some time.",
