                "reviewText": "I bought this for use in my escape room. I use it with an amplifier to speak with guests through a series of speakers. I previously had a wired microphone which worked fine, but it was annoying not being able to get up and walk around. This wireless mic really did the trick. I was skeptical at first about the quality but it's actually fantastic. And it's quite a bit louder than my previous mic and I had to turn down the volume on my amp. It connects super easy, just turn on the receiver and then turn on the mic. and it connects super fast. I've been able to walk out of the room and down the hall and it still worked which is also awesome. There are a few things that are odd about it, at least for my use. The mic itself takes 2 AA batteries, which are easy to change. The receiver has a rechargeable battery which is great, but there is no LED that lights up when it is charging and I wish there were. You just have to assume it is charging. The LED on the receiver is GREEN when it turns on and is NOT connected, and turns RED when it is connected. That seems backwards to me, but once you figure it out it's fine. There is no way to mute the mic once it is on and connected. It's either on or off. At first I thought this was going to be a problem but it really isn't for 2 reasons. First the mic is directional. I can set it down with the top pointed away from me and it doesn't pick up any sound. You do need to remember this when using it and speak into it directly. The second reason is that because it connects to the receiver almost instantly i can just turn the mic off when i'm done talking and then when I need to speak again I just pick it up and flip it on and it instantly connects and is ready.The mic has a small display that shows battery life, which seems to be pretty good, as well as the channel it is connected to. You can change the default channel so I can, in theory, get a second mic and use it in the same room without interference. I haven't tried that but it should work.Overall this is an awesome mic for the price despite a few of the quirks.",

                "reviewText": "The microphone with our Pyle public address system has seen better days in the elementary school. Unfortunately could not locate an exact replacement unit but this all metal professional microphone and receiver kit is a major upgrade! Really beefy and well made. Plugs into the auxiliary port and works well. Easy to recommend this for a wireless device or as a replacement for an existing device that has failed. We will see if the kids can destroy this one!",

                "reviewText": "This is a decent quality bargain UHF wireless mic for light duty use. It has a good feel, the transmitted sound is excellent for speech and decent for voice singing. It's easy to use. It automatically chooses a free channel, in the face of interference on a given channel. Overall, for the price, a reasonable item.BUT: If you need a system you can RELY on for use over over numbers of hours, DO NOT BUY THIS, the Pyle PDWMU105. Insetad, buy the (slightly more expensive) PDWMU103, also sold here on Amazon.The two look alike. The microphones for each look identical externally (tho are not interhcangeable).But this item, PDWMU103, has a soldered-in NON replaceable lithium rechargeable battery in its receiver! If the reciever's battery goes dead, YOU ARE OUT OF LUCK. You CAN NOT drop in a new battery to make the show go on. WORSE, this item's battery is pretty small, and relatively low capacity (I know... I opened it up to look at the battery). In contrast, the otherwise near identical PDWMU105's receiver uses a BIG 18650 lithium ion cell, the single most common kind of replaceable LiIon cell. It has a huge capacity, and you can trivially have a spare, charged up, handy, and if need be drop it into the receiver on the PDWMU105's receiver with no need for tools to do so, in a matter of seconds, literally.The two systems are otherwise the same, and have essentially the same electronics.But the PDWMU103 costs a bit more than the PDWMU105. $20 more, last time I checked. But... it's WELL WORTH IT for near all applications, however, I'd say.PDMU103 on Amazon:https://www.amazon.com/Pyle-Kit-Portable-Professional-Unidirectional-Transmitter/dp/B08XDN5Y4W/ref=sr_1_1?crid=36O6NRTRIP5O5&keywords=PDWMU103&qid=1671776553&s=electronics&sprefix=pdwmu103%2Celectronics%2C117&sr=1-1",

On the phone with someone who put me on hold, read the directions to me that I already told him did not work. Missed the return window hoping I could get someone from tech support to provide help.

However the battery in the receiver portion of the microphone does not hold a really big charge. I am not sure but an external power-source could possibly be added when doing longer gigs. Any cell 5 volt cell phone power source will do such as an external batter backup or wall charger. The handheld microphone shell is made of a metal alloy and not cheap plastic.
