                "reviewText": "Pros:-People can hear me nice and clear-The build quality is decent-The big round LED to tell it is on or not-Easy to assemble-Easy to set up for windows 10 without the driver being installed, window 10 detected it in 1 to 2 min.-The cable that connects to the mic is detachable.-The size of the mic is compact in my opinion compared to other mics-The stand/base is made of metal, so it doesn\u2019t move that easily.- packaged nicely- According to others the noise cancelation just makes it less static noise and more clear on my voice, but I have to talk loud/louder it sometimes.Cons:-Has no sensitivity control on the mic, so I have to tweak it through windows because sometimes it picks up background noise but this is rare and depending on the game chat/platform.-The detachable cable is not braided (not a big deal because the cable is replaceable and it is thick enough).-The stand needs to rotate more, it only rotates a little. Unless you are trying to keep this on your desk for one place this will be fine.Build quality:-The base/stand is made of metal and the rest is made of plastic.-The build quality is decent-The stand/base is made of metal, so it doesn\u2019t move that easily or fall over.Nice to have in the next generation mic:- braided detachable cable- build in sensitivity control- I feel like the plastic could be thicker to make it feel more premium. Right now it feels average to decent compared to other mics.- A more rotatable base/stand.Overall:Compared to other mics in the price range this is an amazing mic for your money.I would recommend it to anyone to buy it. It is worth it because it is easy to set up and there aren\u2019t big flaws when getting this mic.",

When using the noise cancelling function of the mic it only serves to increase static rather than mute other noises. You can still hear nose from the other side of the house.I plugged headphones into the mic to see how it sounded and there was no sound via the headphones. Not sure what the issue is there.And the cable that can with it was frayed. I messaged the seller and they want me to buy one myself and they will reimburse me. No thanks. Just send me one.",

                "reviewText": "After having this product for about 2 months, I can assure you that the price you are paying for this mic and the quality you are getting is a steal! Most microphones average $40-60, this is under HALF the cost.The microphone is great for gaming and streaming, nice crisp and clear audio. If you're a discord user (or calling somebody on another platform), this is a really good mic for calling. If you're a musician, like myself, this mic is also good for recording. I will warn that unless you have your own audio interface, you will face input delay in FL Studio (3-6 milliseconds, that's the lowest I can get it to go).The mic is plug-n-play, just plug it into your computer and it will work. I have tested this microphone on Windows 10/11, as well as 3 different distros of Linux (Nobara 37, Tuxedo OS and Lubuntu 22.04), and they all detect the microphone perfectly.If you're looking for the best bang-for-your-buck, get this microphone!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is my take on the Bietrun UMKF01 microphone. I am an up and coming content creator on a streaming platform, I need a microphone that could accurately capture the commentary I provide when I stream video game content. So far this microphone gets the job done. It does not have the advanced noise cancelling features that more premium microphones have; but at this price point, I would gladly get this mic as an entry level purchase.These are what I consider to be its pros and cons:PROS:-It is a cardioid microphone and it does pick up audio mainly from the front, some audio from the side and the rear-It comes with a stand that rotates and is adjustable for proper positioning whether in content creation or meetings-It uses micro-usb, this to me is a Pro because you are able to get a replacement cable if ever you lose the cable it comes with.-Indicator LED, it lights up green when it is recording or live and red when it is muted.-Has headphone jack for monitoring audio (Don't know what you sound like? plug a pair of headphones to do so; volume knob allows you to adjust volume while you monitor your own voice)Cons:-Plastic construction, it is what you pay for (the microphone has survived many falls from a 3ft table to hardwood floors)-Short cable, it does not have that long of a cable (approximately 3ft in length)Overall, this microphone is a good entry level microphone. If you are doing commentary work, meetings, or need a good quality microphone for the price, this is the microphone for you. If you are well versed in audio manipulating software, this mic is a great purchase as you can make the audio quality even better!",

                "reviewText": "I have probably bought a dozen stand-alone mics for various Windows platforms (currently on WIN 11) and this is by FAR the best bang for the buck. It is truly plug-and-play, and when I am using them, I am at least 2 feet away, and the sound it crystal clear. The one thing I would change (NOT a flaw) is the glowing green light (indicating it is on) is incredibly bright and is distracting when using in low light between you and your PC monitors. I wrapped a piece of black electrical tape around that...and I couldn't be more happy with this device, overall. Highly recommend.",
