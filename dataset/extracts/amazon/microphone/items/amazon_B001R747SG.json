It went all over Europe with me, while staying in hotels with less than ideal sound environments. The Samson Q2U is great at keeping unwanted noise at a minimum, allowing for less tweaking. It isn't the most articulate mic, and that's exactly why it works. It smooths over vocal imperfections like mouth noises, while maintaining a professional tone. Tried the more expensive Samson Q9U, & wasn't impressed. The Q2U also blows away the Shure MV7, so If looks aren't important to you, buy two of these and save some money.",

                "reviewText": "This microphone which you can often find somewhere between 50 and $60 is just awesome for anybody who is on a budget, you sound quality is extremely good it can be used as an XLR microphone or it can be used as a USB microphone, of course it does sound better on XLR but it does sound great on USB as well, if you can afford to spend a little more sure get something a little better but let's just say you're somebody making YouTube videos or doing some sort of vlog or something like that you can buy this microphone and the audio quality is actually good enough that you would never need to replace it with something else unless for some reason you just didn't like the sound of this one or you really just want to get something better but it's really that good I mean for the money this is probably one of the best options out there, I've actually done some reviews on my Danny lightning audio channel where I can pair it to some much more expensive microphones and I think it really holds up and competes with the best of them",

                "reviewText": "TLDR; for spoken word, live performances, and YouTube recordings, it makes no sense to buy a more responsive mic. Plus the dual output function makes this much super handy. For recording Adelle in a studio, look elsewhere.Sensitive to interference with both USB and XLR. If you can get rid of the hiss and hum from certain electronics (mine hates my monitor), this guy sounds really good. It rejects of axis and background noises impressively well. The included XLR cables are above average and impressive (and long) at this price. The included pop filter is a plus, though not a huge necessity as it handles plosives respectably.The stand is a joke, but the included 4\" boom section comes in handy around the studio. It does work. The shock mount is adequate. The USB cable is too short if routing along a boom arm, so pick up a longer one.Small nit picks:There is a strange equatorial channel that a rubber band sits in. I don't know if it's as bumper, or is there to hold on the screen, but it comes off way to easy. Maybe if you replaced it with an actual o ring it would be useful.I would trade in the stand (and pop filter/wind screen) for a decent case or pouch.Pros: The dual functionality is a winner and a no brainer. This guy pulls multiple duties for content creators with it's dual output capability. It would be totally adequate for singers and bands on a budget. It's good enough to shape it or EQ how you want it to sound. Who's doesn't EQ anyway? Nobody would notice any shortcomings in a live setting-meaning it won't sound cheap. It will sound good if you do. It is great for spoken word, voice overs, podcasts, etc. By the time YouTube squeezes it through it's processing, you won't hear a difference between this and an expensive mic for spoken word. You tube compression algorithm-the great equalizer for budget enthusiasts!The dynamic aspect makes using it in non ideally spaces easy. Of course this isn't a world class mic, but like in all things in life (especially audio) you are close to the level of ever diminishing returns here (for dynamic mics). It would be a good by being just USB, it just XLR, but both is a steal! Very sturdy to boot. I don't handle it much, but handling noise seems well controlled. I'm not sure what mic likes being handled... I'm sure they are out there for broadcasters.The no lag monitoring works great. I have low impedance headphones for so i can't say how well it drives high impedance cans. That's why i monitor with low impedance cans -no amp needed! I used to pay extra for performance, now i pay extra (or less) for simplicity and portability. I haven't checked the frequency response for micing instruments, but i doubt this is a good mic for that. It doesn't seem bright enough.Of course this isn't a condenser mic-which could be good or bad. So pick it for your use case.",

Mete un poco de ruido pero nada grave, adem\u00e1s se puede suprimir por software, yo lo hago con Reaper. Lo \u00fanico que no he logrado usarlo por medio del OTG del m\u00f3vil, lo reconoce como un DAC para conectarle unos aud\u00edfonos al Jack del micr\u00f3fono, pero no lo reconoce como micr\u00f3fono, as\u00ed que s\u00ed lo quieres para usarlo con Android, primero investiga bien.
