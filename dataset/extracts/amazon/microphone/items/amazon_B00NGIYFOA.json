                "reviewText": "I really like this headset. It has a mute button you can press that is very helpful and a volume up and down button. I like how it is only on one ear so that I can also hear other people in the house when they need to speak with me or if somebody were to knock on my door. I don't know about other games but when I play my elder scrolls online, I only hear the person or people chatting with me and not the music or noise of the game, but of course one ear is uncovered and you can hear that coming from the TV itself. These are definitely the type of headsets that you need to be gentle with but I have been able to make a pair last a couple years and I've also had a pair last only one year but I do love this particular model the best but it does seem that they may be not making them anymore since you cannot get them on the Xbox store anymore and I have only been able to find them for sale through third-party sellers and it will definitely make me sad when I can no longer buy one from anyone. I do recommend this headset",

It seems to disconnect from Xbox intermittently and becomes unable to be detected. I hope others have had better luck than I did. I didn\u2019t go below 3 stars because at first it worked amazing. So with that being said I won\u2019t buy another and can\u2019t recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "If you own the Original XBox One with controllers that don't have a 3.5mm audio jack built into them then this is your only option for replacing the headset that came with your XBox. The replacement headset works fine. I can hear the chat conversation well and others hear me with no distortion or static. The headset does not have the same frequency response or dynamic range of more expensive headsets but this one meets my needs and should meet the needs of most casual gamers who own the Original XBox One.",

Sure do it\u2019s a great headset and a good for gaming. The best part is that it has a mute mic button so that you can mute the mic whenever u want to just by pressing the buttons. \ud83d\ude3c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb",
