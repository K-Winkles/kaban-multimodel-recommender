Voice was clearer but very soft.With MAXTOP mic:There was a bit of background noise and background feedback.The sound of my voice was definitely louder. When I pointed the mic directly at my mouth and pulled the mic closer, the sound quality was a lot better and clearer.I think with some post production the benefits would shine brighter.Pros:WirelessSimple to use and set up.2 Mics that can be used in tandem.This type of mic is perfect for using during simple interviews or discussions with 2 people.Don't clip the mics on something that moves around a lot.Point the mics towards the sound you're trying to pick up.Solid 4/5 product",

I work in marketing for real estate and do a lot of voiceovers as well as on camera social posts for the properties we feature. I think the best part about this microphone set is that I can use them on my newer iPhone, but my coworker can use it on her lower generation phone. So easy just to flip that receiver to accommodate whatever phone you have. But what really blew me away was the sound quality. In fact, I have used it in my studio to tape voiceovers on my phone and import those into my editing software because I find the voiceovers to be so crystal clear. Highly recommend this. Can\u2019t believe the price for such a little powerhouse duo!",

                "reviewText": "My review is based on value. I boughts to replace a $250 single lapel wireless mic I had purchased for my then GoPro in 2012 (mic batteries now defunct). Sound is even better and probably similar to the iPhone native mic. Much more compact than old lav mike. It a mono system, if both mikes are used, they are mushed into a mono channel. On tests in an open space, absolutely no interference and audio drops outs started at 80-90 m. I guess it would be much less in a building. Extremely simple, automatically pairs and just works. Studio grade mikes ($$) will have better audio specs and better security and interference rejection, many more options, thats my assumption.",
