                "reviewText": "Could not be more pleased with this product. Typically \"gaming\" products are lackluster in their construction, materials, and performance, but this is a huge exception.Installation: Incredibly easy to install. Takes less than ~2 minutes. All you do is clamp to your desk, and drop the arm into the hole. The arm is easily installable with no instructions required.Materials: Dense, sturdy metal for the boom arm. \"Twisty\" knobs are plastic but feel high quality with smooth turns. The joints on the arm are very smooth, and easy to adjust while still holding their position.Performance: The range of motion is very large, and you can really cram your mic into small spaces thanks to the foldable arm joints. The microphone holds position well and does not sag or droop. The boom arm is easily swayable/movable to hide the microphone when not in use. The boom arm is also very sleek with its cable management. The only complaint I have is that the cable management magnets could be stronger.I would compare this to other professional boom arms for music production as opposed to other gaming products since this boom arm far exceeds a \"gaming\" product.I could not be happier with this purchase, and would recommend this to anyone looking for a clamp arm/mount for their microphone.",

The motion is smooth and fluid...until you have to make a major adjustment. While I am SUPER thankful for the great tension offered by the adjustment knobs, they sometimes require some real torque to set and undo. I want to try the non low profile version at some point.

                "reviewText": "As a streamer, having a good quality microphone is crucial, and the Elgato Wave Mic Arm Microphone is an excellent option for anyone looking to improve their audio quality.First and foremost, the build quality of the mic arm is top-notch. The arm itself is well-made and feels sturdy, and it's easy to adjust the height and angle of the microphone to get it in the perfect position. The microphone itself is also very high quality, with clear and crisp audio that really enhances the overall quality of your stream.One standout feature of this mic arm is the built-in shock mount, which helps to reduce any unwanted vibrations or noise. This is particularly important if you have a mechanical keyboard or if you tend to move around a lot during your streams.The Elgato Wave Mic Arm also has a low profile design, which is great if you're working with a limited amount of space. It features a 360-degree rotation and a horizontal reach of up to 32 inches, so you can easily position it wherever you need it. When you're not using the microphone, you can simply fold it up and out of the way, which is really convenient. Setting up the Elgato Wave Mic Arm is a breeze.Overall, I highly recommend the Elgato Wave Mic Arm Microphone for any streamer who wants to up their audio game. It's a high-quality, well-built mic arm that will really help take your streams to the next level.",

                "reviewText": "I use this mic arm at work for video chat calls and for capturing dialogue for on-screen demo recordings. My primary criterion for this use case were 1) the ability to quickly move it in and out of position to keep my workspace clear when not in use, 2) strong fixtures that hold the microphone in place, eliminating constant readjustment, and 3) high-quality build. This arm meets them beautifully. I leave all of the joints unlocked, which means that I can instantly swing it over to join a video call. However, leaving them unlocked means that if you bump it from below, you may possibly lift one of the arms from its seating. The upper arm and ball head clamps are not the most high-quality I've ever used (the tightening motion gets a bit jerky as the pressure increases), but they hold well. The cable channels are an excellent design feature and make for a very clean look, though if you have a tough XLR cable, certain motions may cause the cable to dislodge the magnetic channels. The table clamp is fantastic \u2014 wide, padded surface area and high-quality machine screw. I'm currently using it to hold an Audix VX10, but I'm confident that it would hold a Shure SM7b, though perhaps with not as much strength as say a Rode PSA1-type of arm (due to the size of the ball head).Definitely worth the $100 I spent on it!",

                "reviewText": "Let\u2019s get my gripe out of the way first: the product is more expensive than most of the things that are out there. I don\u2019t necessarily believe that it justifies the price, but it\u2019s worth it if you need the quality of life improvement, which is to say\u2026 stability.This thing is much more sturdy than my spring loaded microphone arm that I had before. It\u2019s very easy to swivel so I could move it out of the way, or right in front of me very easily. There is zero wobble on this thing. The mechanism to hide the cabling is all magnetic and very easy to use. In fact, it\u2019s probably the easiest cable management system I\u2019ve ever used. It\u2019s also not very heavy, and the low profile keeps the entire arm under my monitors, which is nice!If you really want this thing, I say wait till it goes on special.",

As someone who frequently attends Teams meetings, having a microphone that delivers clear audio is crucial. While I already had a mic, the lack of a good mic arm often resulted in my mic being in the way of my keyboard, and if i move it too far, my voice will be too quiet.Its low-profile design keeps it out of the camera\u2019s view during meetings, ensuring a professional appearance. Plus, the premium build quality is evident, and the added cable management feature keeps my workspace neat and organized.If you\u2019re working from home and looking for a reliable, unobtrusive solution for your microphone setup, I recommend getting the Elgato Wave Mic Arm.",
