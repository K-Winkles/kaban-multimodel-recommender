Early afternoon until 10 pm!!I had contracted the \u2018virus\u2019 back in late March until April and hadn\u2019t sang for so long, and I knew my vocal cords did have problems\u2014but as I practiced over & over I finally sounded great close to 10 pm!This little dream mic helped me forget and helped my self esteem in a very long time\u2014for that reason & more\u2014I highly recommend from kids to adults!
