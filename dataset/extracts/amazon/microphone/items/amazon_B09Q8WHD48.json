                "reviewText": "This set of microphones was a game changer. We own a professional karaoke system for more than 5 years that we use most of the time in our livingroom for our own enjoyment. We used to have corded microphones that seen to do the job just ok, but dealing with the cords in many reasons it's a pain in the back, plus they gave us problems with the feedback so we kept them lower than we wanted. We wanted a change. So, we were worried about sound quality, fidelity and even the battery life. Well, we searched, we read, and finally we purchased this one, hoping it was the right one. And yes, it is! We can be more happy, the sound improvement is incredible, exceed expectations and more. They have a nice grip and weight, they feel like the real deal. They look beautiful, have an amazing range, capture our voices and other sounds that we want (like my guitar) fantastically, the base is easy to set, and looks great too. And for the cherry on top of the cake, no more feedback issues. We play now really loud. Really, really loud.",

                "reviewText": "This microphone set comes with everything you would need to take it to an event. The hard case protects and holds all the components perfectly, including space for two sets of batteries. So, you could have the batteries loaded in the microphones when you set out - with room for two spare sets of batteries in the case. That's a good idea!Speaking of batteries, the microphones have a very handy \"remaining battery life\" indicator on them so there's no guessing about when to replace them. You can see right on the display. This is a huge bonus and Gudeholo deserves a lot of credit for including it!The receiver has a nice large display that shows you which channel each microphone is using, and it works like a 2-channel mixer so you can adjust the volume on each microphone separately before it is output to your mixer or other device.One drawback to the microphone design is that you have to unscrew the handle to access the controls for the channel and the gain on the microphone. So, if you're in the middle of an event and you get interference, you'd have to basically take the microphone apart to change the channel. This prevents accidental interaction with the button, but it seems like that function could or should be more easily accessed. As a matter of fact, it seems to me that the channel changing feature should be accessible at the receiver, since that's where an audio technician would be most likely to be during an event... At the sound board. Just an idea.I'm a little mystified as to why they called this microphone set a Karaoke accessory. I mean, it could be used for Karaoke for sure, but these are professional quality wireless microphones that could be used for any application. They're rugged, work well, and sound great.I have removed one star from my review because I have seen very similar sets being sold for as much as $20 less than this set. Not having used the other sets, I can't say they're any better or worse, but I can say that they look almost identical to this one, which leads me to assume that maybe this set could be priced a little closer $80 instead of $100.",

I wasn\u2019t expected much for a brand I\u2019ve never heard and a cheap price point. Right out of the box these are easy to set up and the quality is pretty comparable to some more expense vocal mics that I have. I\u2019ve only had them a short time so not sure the longevity yet, but so far I\u2019m pleasantly surprised with this purchase.",
