                "reviewText": "As a video creator, one of the most important things for me is sound quality, ease of use and connectivity. This wireless microphone set is great because it comes with two microphones and one receiver. The receiver has multiple connections for different types of mobile devices. In the past, I had to buy separate kits every time I updated my phone. With this set you can connect to older iPhones as well as new ones. The wireless connection happens automatically and sound quality is perfect. I highly recommend these to any novice video creators to professional video creators. A+",

I wanted it as my microphone while teaching a course, where my laptop is recording the screen session and also displaying to the large screen in the lecture hall as an external monitor. But this microphone's receiver uses one of the two USB C ports on my Macbook, and physically blocks the other USB C port from being used at all, so I cannot record a session while also using an external monitor, which is the only thing I wanted to do with this. The microphone receiver does NOT work in the Macbook headphone jack, nor does it work when attached to a short USB C extension cable (which I tried because this eliminates the physical blockage of the port where I want to attach to the external monitor).",
