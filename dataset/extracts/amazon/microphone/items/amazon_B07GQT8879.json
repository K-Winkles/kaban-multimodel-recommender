                "reviewText": "So i was looking for a starter microphone for YouTube videos for my channel. looked through reviews on google, all the top 10 mics were 200 bucks to 500 dollars. I needed something affordable to get started with, so started looking at amazon reviews for 20-100 dollar mics on a swing arm. This one caught my eye with a lot of reviews for a decent price. it is totally worth the money. It was literally plug and play, just went in to my windows sound menu and selected it as my default mice. it DOES NOT have a mute, but doesn't record unless you start your recording program and will start recording immediately. I used . My Geforce Experience recording and it works fine. be warned it has great pick up use the pop filter, and it picks up my stupid chair squeaking. while they clamps to hold it in place are not what i would say are top notch quality they do the job, swing arm is good, and cable is USB and is of good length i run 3 monitors 27In on right 36IN TV center and 24IN on left with computer on the far right and mic on the far left and cable works fine. Great Value and quality for $54 dollars shipped. so if your just getting started streaming or other social media this is a great starter Microphone.",

                "reviewText": "An amazing microphone (and holder/boom arm) that sounds great!You COULD pay $200, $300, $400 for the microphone that Joe Rogan uses (Or your favorite Youtuber, podcaster, etc..)But we are living in a time where you can get incredible audio quality for 1/4 of that price.That comes from this microphone.You can get GREAT sound quality without FINANCIAL STRESS.Why add more stress when you can get great sound quality?Okay, if you are an audio engineer, or need the best of the best of the best, then I can see how you might want something else.But, for me, I just wanted something that sounded crisp, professional, is easy to use, and comes with a boom arm/pop filter.And this exceeded my expectations for all those! I am very pleased.If you want GREAT quality audio with the LEAST amount of financial stress -- this is your answer.",

                "reviewText": "I've been doing my research on microphones for use with a new Podcast series that my friend and I want to start as well as some YouTube product review videos. First off, compared with the two previous mics that I had, this thing is amazing for the price and when you consider everything you get with the package it's the best place to start.The stand is sufficient and holds everything very steady and is fully adjustable with some good tensioning knobs to keep it in place. The pop filter fits nicely although I like to just use the wind foam that slides over the mic itself. It's sounds the same and allows me to keep a clearer view of my desk and my monitor. The best part is the sound quality. Is it the best mic out there--no--but with a bit of tuning in your DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) you'll be amazed at how good of a recording you can get from this it. I like everything about it so far. One thing to keep in mind is that if you back away too far from the Mic, even with the gain up, your voice is going to sound more ambient. Keeping your face 2-4 inches from the mic produces clear and well detailed audio. The USB option just works perfectly on my Mac, and on my PC--although I use this with GarageBand on my Mac. If you're just starting out and you want all the bells and whistles for recording your voice for well under $100 you can't go wrong with this setup. Enjoy!UPDATE 4/16/2019 - I'll need to strike my comment about the mic being more abient as I pull back, that is a function of the space I'm sitting in. I'm going to add some curtains and sound insulating panels to some the open areas of my new home studio to reduce the echos that the room produces. This is one sensitive mic! Also, something that just blew my mind. I realized that my desk was too deep for the extension arm that came with the mic so I surfed around and realized that Maono also had a mic setup like this with a desktop mic stand (using a weighted base). I reached out to them and asked if I could purchase that stand separately, letting them know how much I loved their mic setup. At first they said that they don't offer the stand separately, but then decided to just mail me the stand free of change. That's right, \"FREE OF CHARGE!\" I was so blown away by this. Talk about customer service. Don't let the lower price fool you folks, these are good folks and their product is worth serious consideration before you drop a lot more money on something that might be as good or even less. I can't imaging needing something better for podcasting and youtube video production.",
