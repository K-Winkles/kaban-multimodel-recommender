                "reviewText": "I got this to use in my Focusrite 2i2 Gen3 Interface, and it didn't work. 48v on or off, there was nothing I could do to get it to work... which was disappointing.I wanted a condensor lavalier bc I thought it'd work perfectly with my setup. It doesn't. And now if I want to use the mic at all, I'll have to get another piece of equipment from Shure, since this mic has a proprietary plug at the end (not standard XLR or audio jack).That's on me for not doing enough research, and for not testing it soon enough to be able to return. Oh well. Maybe one day I'll get the other piece I need, try it out and update this review.For now, 3 stars, bc I literally have no idea about how well it works.Moral of the story: If you are getting this to use in a USB Interface, using an XLR adapter (I tried 2 different ones), don't. Don't waste your money, if you have the same intentions as I did. *Shure* would be cool if it did work though lol, since I've heard good things about the sound quality of these mics.",
