Works well on all three. Sound the other end of the wire is awesome. Yes it is definitely best if you yak close up to the thing, but it also is pretty good even at a distance. The retro look is very cool, and it is very stable and does not pick up too much vibration through the base. Overall I rate this 5 star, two thumbs up. Glad I bought this instead of the smaller siblings. Worth it for business use as well as games, and social. With the current social distancing, do yourself stand out from the crowd and don't sound like a turkey on the internet! Definitely recommended.BYTW, this Yeti was refurbished. Like new.",

I wanted to get a desk microphone that would last, and after over 2 months of using this one nearly daily, it's working just fine. It has plenty of settings to adjust to whatever your needs may be, the only downside being that you probably can't just plug this in and go; you will need to find out what settings work best for you. I would also recommend getting a different sort of mount for it; although the standard base that comes with the mic is well made, it can get in the way while gaming and it picks up every keystroke and mouse click if you don't have your sensitivity low enough.",

                "reviewText": "I teach in higher education and have used a Blue Yeti microphone at work. When we transitioned to fully online classes in Spring 2020 due to the Covid19 pandemic I decided to by my own for my home office. Durable, sturdy, great sound quality for recording voice for instructional videos and live meetings/class sessions with students. Seamless connection and easy to use. I also have a daughter who wants to pursue a career in music. This spring we used the Blue Yeti microphone for her virtual recital and it worked great for that to. The gain setting is useful for family Zoom calls with grandparents - I can boost the gain (sensitivity) so quieter children can be heard.",

                "reviewText": "At first I could not figure out why it did not show up in System Preference (Device Manager for Windows users) so I did a search others had similar problems. Until I spotted a you Tube video that a fellow was having on his iMac. He swapped a cable but did not explain why. So I searched found a smaller USB cable this one was small a 12\" one and voila it showed up as Yeti Stereo Microphone. We found another one about half as long as the original and it to also worked. So if any Mac user or even a Windows user is having a problem for the device to initialize try swapping a smaller length cable. I think there may be a voltage drop in the longer length cable that may cause problems for the computer to pick up the signal. -- Lou Cioccio",

                "reviewText": "Mine is a renewed product, it's a good mic for beginners like me, I think the noise cancellation worked really nice and fine. It cancelled lot of background noise, of course you need to have quite room for recording, that's a prerequisite. The sound quality too was quite well recorded, I have bought this mic to record my son's song, it did a pretty decent job, wanted to go for XLR but the problem was I was tight on a budget, with XLR one would also have to pay for audio interface or mixer, and again a good XLR mic is not cheap such as Shure mics they sell at a premium. each and every item in the pic have been bought from Amazon over a period of time. I found the renewed Yeti mic good for the price, wanted to go for a new one but the price is too high and I don't think the price of the new one needs to be this high 12500/-. I hope my renewed does not go dead, I want this much to work for years to come. I found the cable supplied with the mic to be a cheap one Selling the new mic for 12500/- the company should make sure to supply premium quality cable, also the mini usb port and the audio jack port was poorly placed, no quality work there. After going through all the reviews majority of those reviews complained about the cheap cable and the poor quality of placement of ports. I did register the product on the blue website.",

Si quieren calidad y buen precio, \u00e9ste es ideal. Si lo que buscan es que tenga lucecitas porque graban podcast de esos de gente blanca que opina desde su privilegio y hace afirmaciones gratuitas, pues compren otro. Pero si son profesionales, compren este micr\u00f3fono.Desventajas: es pesado si lo traes en la mochila, pero aguanta caidas. Igual no lo tiren.",
