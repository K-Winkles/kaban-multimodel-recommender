                "reviewText": "I bought several desk top mikes to add sound to my old silent 8mm movies which I spent hours converting to .mp4 digital. THIS ONE is the ONLY ONE that works!I bought a cheapie at $4.99... You'll find it, looks just like this one, but has a 3.5mm jack that goes into the mike input jack on your computer / laptop. It did not provide more than about 2% volume, muffled sound.So... stick with ANY of the Jounivo mikes. They range from about $11.99 (model JV610) to $16.99 (model JV601, this one). And, they ALL seem to be pretty much the same -- mute button, LED indicator (green when mike is 'open', red when muted). They call two models the \"pro\" models (JV610P and JV603P) for $16.99 same as this one, but I'd bet they ALL work just great about the same as this one!I was just so happy when I plugged this one in (USB) and it worked immediately. No settings required in my computer. And the voice was clear and strong.I think it comes with a silly 2 year warranty. I doubt you'll need it. This will probably work just fine for 20 years! And, they package it so neatly in a little cardboard box that you know cost them $2 just to create and ship! And, it comes with excellent instructions how to log into your computer settings if it doesn't work immediately as mine did.",

                "reviewText": "When I first got this plug and play USB microphone it wouldn't work. I tried troubleshooting I tried unplugging it and plugging it back in I tried plugging it in a different USB port. Windows detected it and saw that it was there it just wasn't hearing any sound. So I tried it on another PC and eventually got it to work and then eventually I got it to work on my laptop. My analog plug-in microphone and my headset microphone and the microphone built into my laptop all work fine and then this j o u n i v o jv603p will suddenly go back to not hearing anything and I'll have to start over and troubleshoot and unplug it and plug it back in and get it to work again. as soon as it's working again I just assume it's going to be working when I actually go to use it and then when I go to use it I usually end up having to spend a half an hour trying to get it to work again. the amount of sound this microphone picks up is underwhelming compared to my wired microphones and the onboard microphone built into my laptop even with the microphone level at 100%. If I can figure out and recreate a root cause for when it stops working again I will update my review. That being said, I have encountered exactly one plug and play USB device in my lifetime that didn't work when I plugged it in and that would be this device. I was frustrated the day I got this product and it continues to frustrate me on a regular basis. Ways Windows describes this hardware include audio endpoint generic audio end point generic USB audio. under driver details Windows reports no driver files are required or have been loaded for this device. The manufacturers website has no information about drivers or a troubleshooting or support for this product.02032021 UPDATE: was working fine for the last day and this morning and Cortana responded to WIN + C just fine. This afternoon I tried and it wasn't working so I checked and it was not the default device because I had plugged in a USB sound card, so I made it the default device again. I noticed in the sound control panel that one green bar at the bottom was illustrated but there was no fluctuation or detection of sound. regardless the HD web camera microphone and the analog wired microphone and the onboard microphone on the laptop were all detecting sound and working properly. in this particular instance I was able to resolve the issue by getting up going over behind the laptop fiddling with wires unplugging the USB microphone waiting 10 seconds and then plugging the USB microphone back in like it's a modem from 2003. Regardless of default devices or unplugging or plugging in other audio devices with microphone capabilities the HD web camera, onboard microphone, and wired microphone all continue to operate indefinitely with no issues; however this USB microphone continues to simply stop working randomly forcing me to apparently unplug it and power cycle it and plug it back in which worked this time but may not work every time.02052021 UPDATE: so I could talk to Cortana yesterday and this morning just fine. No hardware or configuration changes. Went to do a voice command this afternoon and it didn't work and Cortana reported that the microphone was disabled. Not only was the microphone enabled and set as default but I could see sound input and hear sound input via voice meeter, even though sound control panel and windows showed no sound input.in this instance I was able to get Cortana to hear me afain by disabling the microphone and then re-enabling it.02062021 UPDATE: so I went to use Cortana again and she couldn't hear me. funny thing is sound was being detected in sound settings and in the sound control panel but Cortana was reporting that the microphone was disabled even though the microphone was enabled. Of course at this point I was ready to grab the box and ship this gift I received back to the place it came from but as it turns out the return window ended three days ago. in this particular instance I disabled and re-enabled the j o u n i v o jv603p several times and also unplugged it and plugged it into a different USB port and restarted my PC. While sound detection would seemingly randomly disappear and return in sound control panel and sound settings I still have yet to get Cortana to hear me today. Every time I click on the microphone or hit Windows cortana responds by saying that microphone disabled enable your input device in Windows sound settings.",
