                "reviewText": "The Rode PodMic is a dynamic microphone, the holy grail for many podcasters and streamers. Priced at around $99, it promises broadcast-quality audio at an almost embarrassingly affordable price point. But does it live up to the hype? Let's dive in.First Impressions:The PodMic feels like a tank. Its sleek black metal body and sturdy mesh grille scream quality. It's surprisingly heavy for its size, which inspires confidence in its durability. The included swivel mount offers decent adjustability, and the internal pop filter is a thoughtful touch.Sound Quality:The PodMic shines in the sound department. It captures voices with remarkable clarity and warmth, thanks to its tight cardioid polar pattern that effectively rejects background noise. It's particularly flattering to speech, adding a touch of richness without being boomy. Compared to condenser mics, the PodMic is less sensitive to sibilance and plosives, making it more forgiving for less-than-perfect recording environments.However, the PodMic is a low-output microphone. This means it requires more gain to achieve the same volume level as other mics. This can lead to increased noise if your preamp or audio interface isn't particularly clean.Features and Ease of Use:The PodMic is a plug-and-play XLR microphone, meaning you'll need an audio interface to connect it to your computer. No fancy buttons or dials here \u2013 it's all about pure, unadulterated sound quality. This simplicity is refreshing, but some users might miss the bells and whistles found on pricier mics.The Nitty-Gritty:While the PodMic is fantastic for its price, it's not without its quirks. Here are a few things to keep in mind:Requires an audio interface: No USB option here, so factor in the cost of an interface if you don't already have one.Low output: You'll need to crank up the gain, potentially introducing noise.No monitoring: No built-in headphone jack, so you'll need to monitor through your recording software.Limited accessories: The basic package includes only the mic and mount. You'll need to purchase a pop filter and mic arm separately for optimal results.Verdict:Overall, the Rode PodMic is a fantastic value proposition for podcasters and streamers on a budget. Its broadcast-quality sound, rugged build, and simple operation make it a compelling choice for anyone looking to up their audio game. Just be aware of the low output and XLR requirement before you dive in.Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars",

                "reviewText": "I've been using Sennheiser headset mics and Modmics forever, primarily for Discord gaming and Teams remote work. While they did the job, I often got complaints about background noise, inconsistent audio levels, and I cringed listening to myself.I finally upgraded to the PodMic with a Wave XLR interface. This thing is a WORLD apart in quality, I easily have the best audio now in every game lobby or meeting. It rejects background noise very well and is extremely clear and crisp, which has gotten a few compliments. I also love the cool design, compact build, and all metal construction - frankly, I still can't comprehend how it's only $99.",

                "reviewText": "Update: 2024 and this thing is going strong. I've gotten so many compliments in games like Valorant and in Discord of how good my mic sounds. A great purchase!Pros:-Build quality. This thing is SOLID! There's no plastic on this thing..all metal. No cheapness here.-Sound quality of this mic is truly great especially paired with a mixer with great pre-amps.-Aesthetically the design is very pleasing. Kinda gives off a retro look with modern spin in my opinion.-The price to performance is truly amazing for what you get with the quality.-The form factor is great and compact.Cons:-The mic has a built in pop filter, but its not the best.-Weight. Since this thing is built like a tank, smaller/cheaper boom arms might struggle to stay in place.Final Thoughts:This thing is truly amazing in every way. Not sure if im blown away by it due to it being my first XLR Mic. Or the fact that I have this paired with a GoXLR and the pre-amps on it/EQ settings makes this thing sound amazing. I've received several compliments on my voice when talking in game on this mic. Some noting how clear, punchy, and streamer like I sound. Though I've listed some Cons, there's really none in my book. I wasn't expecting the built-in pop filter to do anything super. If there was one con I'm not a fan of is if you should get a pop filter cover, it takes away from the aesthetic of the mic. Since the mic is pretty compact, the pop filter makes it seem you have a black blob on a mic arm. Again, this is pretty minor all and all. Gotta say i'm definitely a fan of Rode now coming from a Blue Yeti USB mic. Well down.",

                "reviewText": "The mic is just a mic. No cables or anything else. Keep in mind that this is a dynamic mic, as opposed to a condenser mic. That means it picks up less background noise, but also means you need to set it up close to your mouth.Stuff you need or might want with this mic:-audio converter: converts the mic's xlr output to aux output (i use a scarlett solo, but i'm sure there are tons of good options)-xlr cable: connect this from your mic to an audio converter. you'll get very poor audio if you connect an audio jack or usb cable directly to your computer-usbc to aux cable: connect from your audio converter output to your computer (use whatever input makes sense)-pop filter: helps reduces extra noise from plosives and tbh looks cool-arm or stand: since this is a dynamic mic, it needs to be close to your mouth. set things up however works best for you, but make sure you're able to comfortably talk and see with mic very close to you.i'd recommend searching rode pod mic set up on youtube just to make sure you get all the necessary components to make the best of this mic.as a side note, i tried using a preamp (cloudlifter CL-1) to output into my audio converter (scarlett solo) and it made almost no difference.this mic is very high quality and i love how it sounds.",

We use it predominantly with XLR to the RodecasterII.The Microphone is made artificially heavy... most likely to justify the huge price increase over the analog only PodMic which doesn't really add any value when you mount it on a boom/arm. Just makes live more difficult for the boom and the friction adjustments to stay in place.Value for money is not great, specifically at the much higher price. We bought it mainly for the future compatibility over USB-C if we ever change our setup. If our budget would have been tighter, it would not be worthwhile spending the extra money for the USB version and we would have bought to the analog only PodMic.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Rode PodMic Cardioid Dynamic Broadcast MicrophoneThis is really underpriced mic. It sounds absolutely amazing for the price you pay. It's even sweeter if you can find this mic on an amazonwarehouse deal.I'm using this mic for work -- basically conference calls. I use a RODE PSA1 swivel desktop clamp mount with it and it is the perfect pairing because the PSA1 can easily hold up the RODE podcast mic. I highly discourage buying a low cost 20-40$ swivel mount because this mic is heavy. It will sag any cheap knockoff mic mount. This mic comes with an integrated wind/pop filter in the mic and i find it works OK however it isnt perfect -- it still has a sharp sound but not that bad imo. I can recommend a Rode WS2 Microphone Pop Filter if you desire a bit more pop filtering but you can live without it to be honest.I'm also using this for hobby recording. Since its a dynamic mic , not a condenser mic, it can take high sound pressure levels. Does a great job with heavy guitar input but its definitely no where as delicate with details especially if you finger pickon an acoustic -- For some things i prefer my condenser mics but theres a time and place for everything.I will however point out that you MAY want to buy an inline mic preamp if youre looking for more output. Things like cloudlifter work -- but cloudlifter costs more than this mic itself so that makes no sense. In my opinion, you can find alternatives (Se electronics \"Dynamite\" fro about 100$ or MANAYO preamp for mere $50 or Coda inline preamp for around $100 ). These will bring a lot more oomph from the Podmic and its worth trying without one first, then deciding if you'd like to buy an inline mic preamp.This is truly a great bang for buck . If youre on a budget, and cant afford the ubiquitous shure sm7b , this is an excellent alternative. It's a GREAT mic for podcasters, video conferencing and the occasional music recording (depending on what youre recording). I'm really pleased to have bought this mic.To end off the review i provided a really simple recording to demonstrate the mic. I used a Focusrite scarlett as audio interface, and first demo is RAW recording while second demo is raw recording wiith JUST the Focusrite \"Air\" exciter function built-into the Focusrite. I think the Scarlett audio interface with the \"AIR\" function is a really great combo since it brings a bit more high ends to the mix without any fuss and whenever you want a warmer sound, you can just turn it off from the Focusrite instantly. Makes for a really great combo: Rode Podmic + Rode PSA1 mount + Focusrite Solo with \"air\" exciter function.Hope this helps!",
