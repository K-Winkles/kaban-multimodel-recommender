The sound quality is awesome and very loud for the size and cost of the product. Additionally, I love that you just charge the pieces and don\u2019t have to fool with replacing batteries!",

At first I was a bit disappointed by how small the speaker was and almost returned it but decided it would be a good stocking stuffer.Christmas Day arrived and I was absolutely impressed. Don\u2019t let the small form factor fool you. This speaker is LOUD and the audio is pretty clear.The speaker has been used a few times everyday since Christmas and is still holding the charge that it came with out of the box.Me being a typical guy admittedly did not read the directions and didn\u2019t realize it had Bluetooth capability. Just looked at the instructions today and connected my phone to it. Music playing through this speaker sounded great. It can easily be used as a stand alone speaker indoors.My daughter has really enjoyed putting on performances with this and I didn\u2019t let its size fool me. Great purchase and great little speaker.",

I like how it has a PU handle to make carrying this around easy, specially for kids.Has 6 buttons on the machine, and 3 buttons on the mic.The color display is surprisingly very good. Rotating rainbow colors or solid breathing changing lights. Very vivid and attractive.The manual lacks depth and the print is so minute. With a large box, they could have printed a page with bigger font and it still would fit the box. The manual does give you a basic rundown of the functions.The mic is so cute and controls reverb and volume (3 settings for each). The sound coming out of the machine is not the best quality (lacking in low freq) but is acceptable, specially if this was to be given to a kid.It also has magic sound which changes the frequency of the voice. Funny.The machine and the mic are rechargeable which is a good thing. Gone are the days scouring the house for batteries. Came with a USB A to USB C cable.Music can be played via bluetooth, which easily connects and has good fidelity. It also has a TF card slot, and USB A port. You can control the music tracks with the machine. There is also a aux port for ear/headphones.Price is unavailable but an exact item being sold by other sellers have the exact unit plus an extra mic that goes for $59.99Overall, this is a great gift for kids and adults too.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Having a Bluetooth speaker and a paired microphone for Karaoke seemed like a great idea. This little Karaoke setup seemed to have a lot of features that I had to try.After receiving this portable karaoke setup I realized the user manual was not the greatest so I ended up spending some extra time figuring out the features this small setup has.Firstly, both the microphone and speaker charge with a USB-A to USB-C cable. Once they are charged you turn them both on with the respective power-on buttons and they pair together. You can also pair the Bluetooth speaker with your phone so you can play music from your phone to the speaker. Another option available is that you can put your music on a micro SD card which you put into the speaker. You can then play your music from the micro SD card.I will go through a few of the features since the product page gives very little information.There are several buttons on the speaker itself. There is a power button. This turns the speaker off and on. It also doubles as a pause/play button.There is a button that looks like a microphone. This button cuts down the volume of the vocals on the music so the instrumental sounds are louder and you can then hear your voice when you add your vocals with the microphone.The button that looks like a light bulb changes the LEDs around the speaker. They can be multiple colors, solid colors, or flashing to the music depending on how many times you press the button.The plus and minus buttons control the speaker's volume.On the back of the speaker is the charging port and the micro SD slot. There is also a headphone jack so you can use wired headphones.The microphone has an on/off button. The plus and minus buttons control the volume of the microphone. They also control the amount of reverb. You have to double-tap these buttons to increase or decrease incrementally the amount of reverb.The button that is the most fun is the bottom button on the microphone. They call it a magic voice button and it alters your voice. Pressing this button multiple times cycles between various interesting voices. There are some that sound like a chipmunk and some that make your voice alien or very low. This feature alone is a lot of fun. I have attached a video demonstrating this feature.So, with all these features and controls does this sound any good? Yes, it does. The sound from the speaker is surprisingly good.Once the mic is paired with the speaker it maintains its connection well.There is a bit of an annoying squeal when you are changing the volume or reverb. This is to let you know that the change has been accepted but is unnecessary.After discovering all the features built into this karaoke set I am amazed at everything it will do and it's a lot of fun even for an adult. I am not sure why OUTUVAS does not advertise these features better and the user manual is hard to follow.If you are willing to spend some time experimenting with the buttons and the sounds and learning what this can do you will be impressed.For such a small speaker with so many features and for the price they are asking it's a great value. I only wish the user manual was a little clearer.",
