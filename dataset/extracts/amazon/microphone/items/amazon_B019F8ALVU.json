I got this for a white elephant present, I couldn\u2019t test it out beforehand if it worked or not because I don\u2019t have an adapter nor a headphone jack.Luckily the person that won the gift did and we tried it out. The microphone is not like a real life one that you can hear yourself talking. It\u2019s after you record the audio and disconnect the microphone that you can hear it work.So IT DOES WORK JUST NOT HOW YOU WOULD EXPECT, or at least how I expected.",
