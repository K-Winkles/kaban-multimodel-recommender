                "reviewText": "These are easy to use, and have a decent enough clip. Compared to other microphones in this price range though, I would expect the clips to be more robust. They do a good job picking up on spoken audio and not picking up too much background noise, and they last long enough to not think about charging them every time, at least in my short stints of usage with them. That said, I do wish they didn't charge exclusively through Type-C as I like how many Lavier Mics now include charging cases akin to airpods, something these do not have. Distance-wise, I have not tested the range of these, but within 10ft of the phone I plugged into, there was no issue for me. I appreciate the inclusion of replaceable pop filters and including an extra set so that you can keep them clean. Without the filter, they do pick up on noises they shouldn't but with them, they sounded great to my ears.",
