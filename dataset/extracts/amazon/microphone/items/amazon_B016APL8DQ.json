                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars It\u2019s built like a tank",
                "reviewText": "The SM58 is the industry standard general purpose \u2013 hand-held vocal microphone. It\u2019s built like a tank. Legend has it that once upon a time a roadie used an SM58 to hammer a nail into a stage prop, then later on that night the lead singer used the very same SM58 to do the show. May or may not be true, but these mics are tough. The sound is warm, with a notable midrange (vocal friendly) peak. They have a multi-layered percussive (pop) filter that effectively eliminates almost all objectionable close-mic vocal problems. In the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s sound engineers who wanted to protect their investment in very expensive Neumann microphones, used the SM58s to mic drums, guitar amps, and other very loud instruments. Consequently many hit songs came out with the characteristic Shure signature sound. The SM58 and it\u2019s sister microphone the SM57, were the one-two punch in rock \u2018n\u2019 roll recording.So when you buy a Shure SM58, you\u2019re buying a legend! THE hand-held microphone of choice for a great number of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll artists. This wireless system is also bullet-proof. I have used it in many venues, where the speaker and/or artist walks around singing, and talking to the audience. The resistance to feedback is quite astonishing. The range of this also amazing. At one event the speaker walked about 60 yards away from the receiver and without a glitch, no interruption of sound.Of course they are indestructible too. Once the master of ceremonies handed the microphone to a kid who promptly dropped it on the concrete floor from about a four-foot height, and after a very loud bonk, the microphone continued to work as if nothing happened. Which reminds me, you should always keep a foam wind screen on your microphone in case someone drops it (not just for the sake of keeping the wind noise out.) It\u2019s $6.00 investment that can preserve the head of your mic. http://www.amazon.com/Shure-A58WS-BLK-Windscreen-Microphones-Black/dp/B0006NMUK4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1443557645&sr=8-1&keywords=Shure+windscreenI know $190.00 sounds like a lot of money, but it\u2019s well worth it. You\u2019re getting a legendary microphone all wrapped up in a sophisticated high-tech wireless system. The battery life is pretty good, and the sound is, well, legendary.",

                "reviewText": "This is a steal for this price. It truly made me think it was a typo. I believe the model I had before was the UX Series. Which is essentially the same as this, except the mic had a small LCD screen on it that showed battery power remaining. Other than that, there isn\u2019t much a difference here. Of course, you get the same old reliable SM58 mic, that you will never have to worry about breaking. The only reason I\u2019m replacing my UX, if I can\u2019t find a replacement mic for it, as the buttons broke on it and I can\u2019t change the frequencies any more. Regardless, this is essentially the same Mic/ receiver combo. With the only thing missing,Being the LCD screen on the mic itself.This is a pro model for a base model price. This Mic will allow you to travel a football field or two before you ever have any issues with break up. The sound quality is everything that you would ever get from any SM 58 microphone. Which is what all of the professional musicians use around the world.Has both a XLR and quarter inch jack in the back to allow you to plug into most any situation you would need. Overall, you will not get a better microphone for the price. And the fact that it uses AA batteries is a huge bonus over the 9 V I used with the UX, which would last two shows and have to be replaced. Whereas, the AA batteries on the new microphone last for at least four shows. Which is pretty amazing and AA batteries are much cheaper. You can buy 200 pack for 20 some odd dollars here on Amazon.So stop listening to me and definitely go buy yourself one now. I\u2019m buying a second for back up and may consider buying more in the near future.",

                "reviewText": "This is replacement for another brand. Previous model had an LED screen, showing you if it was on, or muted.You need to use the Shure chart to ensure that your mic is legal in your area of the country (US). I have no idea what folks who travel a lot (musicians/speakers) do to meet these requirements.I thought I'd miss the mute button. I don't. Users at church start playing with the buttons, and that takes the control away from the folks at the sound board. They can turn it off, or on.Remove the battery cap, and you'll find the controls to connect to a Shure receiver. I don't have enough receivers, so I connected this to one of the existing ones ... can't use the headset, and this at the same time, however, you can use one at a time. The gain is different, therefore I set our x32 Behringer to the lower gain value. I have to turn this mic up each time (only since I'm sharing a receiver).Battery life is amazing! We also have some 9v mics (this one uses (2 AA) that don't last nearly that long. We regularly use rechargeable batteries, and that's worked out really well. Just to be sure we check the battery level before use. After several uses no battery issues.This mic you can use at lips or about 8\" away without issue. As with any mic it works best when closest to the sound source.Overall very pleased, and will be purchasing a receiver so we don't have to share a channel between mics.We're slowly moving to all Shure equipment for compatibility.",
