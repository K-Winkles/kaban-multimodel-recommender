The sound quality is outstanding - a full range with good base and no hiss. Not really possible to tell the difference between these and Sennheiser lapel mics. You can't however say the same for Rode shotgun mics - the Sennheiser options are noticeably more sensitive.The connectors are TRS, so they won't work with a smartphone without a TRS-TRSS adapter (TRSS jacks have an extra ring). So don't buy the later Rode mic if you need a TRS connection for your mixer or camera!",
