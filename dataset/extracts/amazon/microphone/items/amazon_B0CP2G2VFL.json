                "reviewText": "I don't think there's a better mic out there for under $80. It's incredibly easy to set up and the quality is fantastic. I love that the mute button is touch so it's silent. I haven't used the XLR yet, but I love that it comes with the option. I really love the way this mic looks. It's sleek and simple.I have a soft voice and with all of the mics I've tried (5-6), people complain that they can't hear or understand me. This mic picks me up clearly and I don't even have the gain turned up to max. It works well with OBS, Discord, and Audacity.",

Chegou um pouco amassada a caixa, sabendo como os correios tratam nossas encomendas, mas o produto veio com pl\u00e1stico bolha bem protegido por dentro. Qualidade de som incr\u00edvel, cumpre o que promete. Recomendo para quem quer gravar conte\u00fado e n\u00e3o tem ambiente tratado. Paguei 430 nesse microfone.",

                "reviewText": "Es un micr\u00f3fono que no le pide nada a muchos de sus competidores directos, es vers\u00e1til en cuanto a conectividad se refiere, lo que mas me gusto es su calidad de audio (sin ecualizar) es bastante buena y es comparable con opciones mas caras que esta, una vez que lo configurar y le das ciertos retoques a su configuraci\u00f3n inicial es cuando mas sobresale sobre otras opciones de mismo precio.Es la mejor opci\u00f3n si no quieres comprar una interfaz de audio y usarlo con USB, aunque tambi\u00e9n te da la opci\u00f3n de usarlo con XLR y en mi opinion el ruido que puede llegar a meter es muy poco cuando grabas, yo principalmente lo uso para streaming y es una maravilla, lo recomiendo si buscas una opcion estetica y que tenga una calidad buena.",
