Yes, you can replace the 18650 battery yourself by purchasing a replacement. Can I hook it up to my stereo for home karaoke? Yes, this microphone is indeed plug and play, which means that it can be used straight away without any complicated setup or additional software installations. Can it connect to any wireless speakers? Yes, the microphone can be used with any wireless speaker as long as the speaker has a compatible 6.35mm interface. I ordered 2 sets of microphones. Can I get all two mics to work on one receiver? No, a single receiver can only support one microphones at a time.

                "reviewText": "Our arts organization for adults with developmental differences had a giant Bluetooth speaker, but only had one corded microphone, and we had a big open house performance planned. I purchased these in hopes they would make everyone\u2019s lives easier, and to be current and professional. My coworker and I expected to encounter frustration and perspiration as we attempted to connect these mics. But, within 5 seconds we had a successful amplified, \u201cHello? Hello? Oh wow! That was it?!\u201d Our performance was hugely improved. They were used for 2 MCs, a karaoke song, and a staged radio play\u2014they worked seamlessly. I was also really glad I purchased 2 mics and not just one. Well worth the investment for us!",

The sound is amazing and the Bluetooth connection is mostly reliable.My wife loves singing and now we find ourselves doing Karaoke 2-3 nights a week. I\u2019m a bad singer but it captures you when you hear your voice.I honestly thought for the low price they were going to be cheap, but so far we had them for a couple of months and they are working great, excellent quality at an affordable price! I sure recommend them.",

                "reviewText": "I am very impressed with the sound quality from these microphones. They pick up the voice really well and transmit it very cleanly. Using both the microphones at the same time results in a really fun experience when doing karaoke. The receiver base charge up and maybe 30 minutes. I haven't gotten a chance to really use it till the receiver base loses power so I couldn't really tell you what the max battery life is; however, we did use it for about 2 hours the other night and the receiver unit was still going strong. For the price, I believe this is the cheapest two microphone set on Amazon and you won't be disappointed in terms of quality. I highly recommend.",
