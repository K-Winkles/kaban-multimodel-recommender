That's minor compared to the major disatisfaction with audio quality both in and out. The Over-the-Ear fitting was slightly uncomfortable. Liked the fact that the controls didn't weigh down the cables since they were mounted on one ear piece.I purposely paid a little extra for better audio pleasure but did not achieve my objective. Don't know how to remediate this for the inevitable next iteration. I am not an audiophile but would love to derive better results without seeking financing options.Ubuntu recognized the device as soon as it was plugged but there are no 7.1 drivers. The microphone recording is sub-standard.",
