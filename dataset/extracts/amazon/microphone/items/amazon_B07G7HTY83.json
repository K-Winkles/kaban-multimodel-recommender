Sadly, they aren't the most durable, and easily broke over time. I use it as a microphone for my computer, it isn't the most ideal, since it has caused them to break much more. The cord started to get pulled out and the clip broke. They work for the price, and it is what you pay for, but I would reccomend if you need a cheap and quick solution to microphones.",

                "reviewText": "Looks solid (pun intended). Thoughtful design: you can use different combinations of the extension cables, so the mics can be either of the same length, or one is super long and the other one is short. No noticeable sound degradation or attenuation for the longest possible extension. When you are using one mic only, you can just plug it directly to the phone, bypassing the V-branching.Included are two spare mic covers, a nice pouch, and an adaptor that's not needed for standard Android phone.There's a very slight crackling sound from the mic particularly in a quiet environment, but is quite acceptable.The standardization of plugs makes it very easy to combine mics of different brands and hear the difference, if any. I bought two pairs of mics of different brands, and you can interchange all the parts with no problem.I haven't tried it in open air with all the wind noise. Will update if there's anything worth mentioning.Note: when testing the mics, don't forget to unplug the cable from the phone first to hear the recorded sound :)",

When I opened them I tested them first on my phone. They did NOT work. I was displeased. I tried them on my computer next. Still didn't work. So then I tried each piece individually to see where the short was. Turns out that I didn't SNAP all the connections completely tight. They snap ALMOST all the way and they look like they are connected but they aren't. So be sure you push hard on each connecting point until they snap all the way tight. With all the connections sure, I tested them again and everything works great. The quality of the sound sound is excellent. The wire size is small and looks a little fragile like a headphone wire might, so you should be careful not to snag, pull or roll over these wires just in case. Now to take these mics into the field and see how they work.",

Cords have a good legth, which will allow you to be creative on your video projects.But I found two problems:1. The splitter, one microphone and one extension cord are hard to click, as if they don't fit correctly. This is bad to a point in which it feels like it's going to break but once they are finally connected, they work just fine.2. It does not work with my huawei p10 lite which is my main tool to produce my videos. It did work with my sister's phone (LG) and with a Lenovo Laptop, but it's very disappointing that it will not work for the purposes I had in mind at firts.Unfortunately I am back to a location where I can not send it back to get a replacement.My advice is: buy it only if you are willing to risk that money since it might not work for your phone.If it does work, it's a very good product for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the Lavalier Lapel Microphone 2 Pack set because my family is regularly on Zoom calls with Friends and Family. I tried out USB Speakerphones but nothing really worked well. I ended up trying these out.They are perfect! On my MAC and Windows PC, just plug in the 4 pin to 3 pin adapter, then plugin the Y cable into that and boom - you can plugin the two mics. The extension cables allow us to sit a long way away from the computer yet still have the Lapel Mic clipped onto our shirts for great sounding mics. I think it's a perfect purchase and well worth the cash.I'm actually going to purchase another set to use for my work computer where I'm on Zoom calls all day. Probably a little overkill, however, having the extra 4 pin to 3 pin adapter will be nice as will the Y splitter cable.",

                "reviewText": "Looked like a good item. Adequate packaging. Even after opening the envelope the items looked just as \"pictured\". But as soon as I tried to clip one on I found the clips were frozen junk...unusable. Then I noticed the foam mic muffs were hardened as if they were very old. Disappointed and returning this item. I hate these moments of disappointment. UPDATE: It was too much trouble to \"return\" this item during this holiday season so ordered a set of clips for these mics. Then, when I could not remove the mics from the frozen, useless metal clips they came with, I used a rotary tool from Amazon and a diamond blade to cut off the clips. The ROTARY TOOL worked just fine. (I'm still impressed with the Amazon rotary tool) A sad experience but true.",

There are plenty of ways to get these to work, I was using a pretty modern phone during my brief test but there are many ways to use these so if it doesn't work at first don't be mentally lazy and play around with different options because my experience has been excellent. Sound quality is amazing and for the price of one of these mics it's a steal but you get 2 and all the extensions and adapters you need for a 2 person interview, if you're looking to conduct interviews or have sit down discussions for this price you really can't go wrong.",
