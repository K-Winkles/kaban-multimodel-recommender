                "reviewText": "The microphone sounds great, and for a reasonable price. I got the version with the on/off switch which is nice to have. The problem is when they shipped it, they just put the mailing sticker on the microphone box. This is a common practice and I have no problem with it, the problem comes in that there was no sticker/tape over the tab where you open the box up. It's just one pull tab and its fully open, and it wasnt even that tight. So anywhere along the shipping route someone could have so easily opened the box, pulled out the stuff, and closed it without it looking any different. Luckily mine was perfectly fine, but it is probably not a good idea to keep shipping it like that, or someone is going to be out 100 bucks because amazon didn't put a piece of tape over the open tab.",
