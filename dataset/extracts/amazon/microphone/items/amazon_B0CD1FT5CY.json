The mic set has helped out team hold meetings that can be understood even when in noisy restaurants.By having this mic set have a usb-c adapter vs Bluetooth, I can use it on any modern laptop and most phones. This helps as some of our volunteers have locked down laptops that can't add Bluetooth devices.In general we only work with one mic, and hold the other as a reserve, but we have had meetings where we needed to use both, and did so with no issues.The size of these are nice they are not much bigger than a thumb drive or rsa token.Also, there are no drivers to install - so that is a nice surprise.",

I got the microphone to make sure my voice sounds louder and clearer for the video and this worked perfectly. I also tested it for TikTok as well and it is a game changer. It comes with two microphones, two clips for if you want to clip the mics on something, and also comes with a charger and the microphones link through Bluetooth seamlessly.",

When using it, I can hear it loud and clear! Sadly, I never got to use it for the project but handed it to a friend. She loves it too! Noise cancelling is fairly good, there is a bit of noise in the background but that's pretty common so I'm totally fine with it as well as the friend.",

The clips for the lapel for the microphones are secure and without a lock for easy assembly and dis-assembly for storage.The noise cancelling feature is superb as I did not pick up any background noise and was able to boost recorded voice-overs at a much higher and clearer volume.The best feature is the fact that you can connect both microphones at the same time in order to achieve a high-quality interview. Highly recommend - couldn't be a simpler system with a secure storage to protect the components.",
