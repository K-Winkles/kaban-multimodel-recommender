Liked the push button mute with light (and yes, I did test as other reviews say the mute did not mute). Works well for my need for hands free speaker talking (as a mic should). Had this for 1.5 months and still works fine.One star down for low volume. The volume control doesn't really increase volume at all.I also had to fiddle around as it did not connect consistently when using an external AC powered USB 3.0 hub. It needs to directly connect to PC's USB port or a USB 2.0 hub.Note: You can detach the mic from the stand holder.",

                "reviewText": "During Covid, I hosted a weekly Zoom meeting for members of my dance club to stay in touch. Each week, my wife and I would start up the Zoom call on my computer and then huddle in front of the computer but the audio was always hard as the computer required the speaker to be right in front of the laptop. We ordered this mic and it has been great. The sound quality is very good and it has a wide angle of response so my wife and I could be comfortably apart, and even behind the microphone refilling our glass and the microphone still picked up our vocal input. We now start a Zoom call each week so people can watch our dance remotely and I place this microphone in front of the speakers so the viewer can hear the music and the caller/cuer (it's a Square Dance and Round Dance club). The sound quality is great but I'm most impressed with the durability of this microphone. For the last 2+ years, I've been jamming this mic into my backpack and then setting up up for the dancing and then bringing back home and it is rock-solid. I fully expected that by now I'd have a short in the wires but this is a quality unit. The volume adjustment and mute button are also very handy. I can't recommend this device highly enough. Great product!",

It may have been a faulty unit, but it was absolutely atrocious added this lack of accuracy and I would never consider purchasing this under any circumstances if voice dictation and accuracy of work is something important to you.

                "reviewText": "I got this hoping that a purpose built microphone would have better quality than the tiny one built into my webcam. I didn't want to buy a gigantic $200 microphone, and so it seemed the only option was a cheap one like this, or one of those. Well I guess I shouldn't have bothered because everyone I talk to reports that there is no difference in audio quality between this and my webcam mic. I can't give it too low of a rating for that though since its price is so low, you can't expect too much of it. Other than the sound quality, it's great. I the arm is very flexible and it is properly weighted so it stays in place. I love the volume knob right on it for fast adjusting without fiddling with finding a setting. Setting it up was easy, and I never had feedback issues. If you're looking for a basic little microphone, it does a great job.*Update* I've had it several months now, and every now and then it stops working. It's only happened three times ever, and when it does, a computer restart usually fixes it. I think it's a software problem and not a hardware one though since some programs still see it, while others like zoom or my phone will not. Just FYI.",
