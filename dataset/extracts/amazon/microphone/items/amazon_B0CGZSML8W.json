                "reviewText": "I love this headset!! It\u2019s extremely comfortable. I wear it a minimum of 12 hours a day. And it never hurt my ears or my head. You can see in my photos that the cushion for the ear is open a bit so your ear fits so nice and snug in that bed and the surrounding padding is so soft. Accross the headband is also cushioned. The microphone flips to either side. So you can have it on your left or right side. The arm of the microphone is bendable as well so you can easily adjust to the perfect distance from your mouth. The sound quality is exceptional!! Background noise is blocked very well. The range is long. I was able to leave my computer go outside and walk my dog and still be connected! I did have to purchase a usb Bluetooth dongle as my computer did not have Bluetooth capabilities which was inexpensive, just check your system ahead of time so you know if you will need one as well. I know it holds a charge a minimum of 12 hours I don\u2019t know past that as I charged it nightly, as to not risk it dying in the middle of my workday. Set up/pairing was very simple, it does take a little bit of time though, so don\u2019t wait until the last minute to pair it or panic, however, you only have to do it once per device . Yes, they can pair with more than one device at a time; which is nice to go between my desktop and my laptop. The power and volume buttons are easily accessible. The mute isn\u2019t a button you just tap the little circle. The only thing I had an issue with was muting, I work from a remote call center if I had it muted when a call came in I could not unmute it and I could not mute it in the middle of a call. Once the call is connected the mute option did not work for me. Other than that these are perfect I would most definitely buy them again. Great Purchace!",
