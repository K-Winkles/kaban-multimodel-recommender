I'm not a professional in audio, just an enthusiast.For my needs, I was thrilled, I ended up using this mic as the primary mic for my voice recordings and the pop filter makes a noticeable difference.The 'scissor arm mount' wasn't the best, I ultimately used my other one with the new mic.It's not a bad price, I'd recommend this to anyone getting started with XLR mics or who needs a backup as equipment can get expensive fast!",
