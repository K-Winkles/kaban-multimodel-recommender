For the most part it has worked fantastically, but after about a week of having it I have been running into some issues. Currently the issues I'm having is randomly static coming thru my headphones and also being heard thru my mic, some times this static is so bad that I have to take my headphones off from how loud it is. I first thought it my be my headphones messing up but after unplugging my headphones and plugging them back in, it still happens. It is only \"fixed\" when I unplug the mic and replug it in, and even then it's a temporary fix. Other than this issue the mic works great, my voice comes thru great and my ambient sounds are almost all eliminated.",

                "reviewText": "Recently I bought a headset that didn't include a built in mic because I liked the audio quality and felt that it was time to at least give a standing microphone a spin, when I saw the value of this microphone I was thrilled to give it a try, but there was that nagging feeling that it was too good to be true.If you are in the same boat let my story be a warning for you, it appears this product has absolutely no QC, the box was in absolute shambles when I received it, the manual was thrown to the side of the box like it was an afterthought, and, although the packaging was alright, it just seemed even more off than before. But again, the price with everything that was included I thought that it would still be quite a good deal, even with all of the aforementioned nitpicks. And then I plugged it in, straight away it gave me the coveted \"Microsoft cannot identify your USB device.\"This message is a nightmare for me as I had a headset that went bad and had the same issues with it doing this same thing, I hoped it was a fluke, and replugged it. When I did it actually identified and was letting me change the settings, fantastic! And just as quickly as that excitement came it fled, when I tested the mic the audio visualizer, for lack of a better term, was stuck at roughly the 30% mark and not moving no matter what noises I made. Okay, it's probably just a problem with my settings, I followed all of the settings of manual, all of which are just \"make our device default\" by the way, not a very in depth process, only to still have the same issue. Well I decided that it could possibly be the USB port that I had been using, as I had never used it before, I unplugged my, currently, working headset and plugged in the USB microphone, now not only was it not recording sound, it was once again saying it was undetectable, and that has now been the full story of this microphone, I have tried 4 more USB slots (don't ask I have a ton of USB slots on my motherboard) and a full reboot and absolutely nothing has changed, I can't even get to the point where I can get it to get detected again. And the worst part is I have no idea if a change in USB cord will even affect anything, as neither the port in the mic, or the cable end on the cable look damaged at all. So thank you Tecurs, you have been a complete waste of my time, and an absolute horrible first impression to standing mics for me, worst part is I'm sure your mic arm isn't even compatible with most other mics so I can't even write this off as just buying an extra mic arm.Okay after 20 minutes of writing this I must amend it, I tried it on my friend's PC, and it detected on his but wouldn't record audio, but then I plugged it into my PC once again, and it inexplicably worked, I have absolutely no idea why this would be the case, it was the same USB port that wasn't working, I didn't even restart my PC again, I must say this is the nature of the beast when messing with cheaper products, I guess I'm happy but I cannot imagine why it works now, I didn't even scrunch the USB in any particular way. I'll amend this with what I feel about the quality of the product after I actually am able to use it now that it is actually functioning.This is after roughly a year, the mic has been working fine, until I moved the arm one day and the entire plastic assembly in and around the mic holster (if you'll call it that) and the part that connects that to the mic arm completely collapsed under the weight of the microphone, there is no way to fix this, so just keep in mind when you buy this product that it will not even last you a full year.",
