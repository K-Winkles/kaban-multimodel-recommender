It lasted 10 years though so no complaints! I know shure mics are reliable and have a good sound so I went with this one for a replacement. We have used it a couple of services and it sounds great! Very clear and crisp. It did cut out for a millisecond while our Pastor was preaching but I think he may have hit the button. He's still getting used to holding this one. The sennheiser's on/off switch was on the bottom and this one is a push button on the side. He's very happy with the sound of it so that is what matters most to us. This mic was very simple to set up. A few minutes and I was done. Great instructions! Over all I think this was a great purchase and would definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I've had this mike for a couple of months, and have used it extensively for both practices and gigs. I really did not want to go wireless, as I've had reliability and clarity issues with wireless systems in the past. But my penchant for spinning around in circles and subsequently knotting up/destroying mike cords forced my hand. Could not be happier with this mike. Setup was incredibly simple--pulled it out of the original packaging at a gig, and the soundman had this mike ready to roll in a minute or two..simple press of a button for it to lock onto the receiver. I've been a fan of the SM58 mike for a long time, and this mike seems to provide even more clarity than a normal 58, which I know doesn't make any sense...maybe it's the digital format. If you are debating on the analog version of this mike that's a bit less money..all I can say is go digital! Clarity and overall sound duplication is great. No issues with blowing Ps or other hard consonents. Button to turn the mike off/mute is nicely placed and impossible to click off accidentally. Mike clip isn't the usual brittle plastic I've dealt with in the past. The case that holds the mike & components is sturdy and road-worthy. I have spent far more money on wireless mikes that offered far less quality. I'd highly recommend this system.",

                "reviewText": "The sound is crisp, and once I figured out how to adjust the gain, (found inside of the mic) it operates well even when close to the speakers. I don't like the push button on/off/mute switch. I have had a shure with this type of button before, and it lasted less than a year before it failed. My old Shure, (purchased 15 years ago, which has taken the abuse of a karaoke bar, and still works, but recently started to buzz) had a slider switch, and was, overall, better quality. I can't say how durable this mic is, as I've only used it two nights, but I'll update later.",

                "reviewText": "What can I say? Shure is a top brand for a reason. The channel scan feature is great to avoid interference. You can quickly sync the mic to the receiver using the infrared transmitter. The mute button doesn't make any sort of audible pop. The soft-side carrying case is durable enough to keep things safe. It doesn't come with an XLR cable, but if you pull the extra block of foam out of the section of the case that holds the power supply, you can easily carry a 3' cable in there, too.",
