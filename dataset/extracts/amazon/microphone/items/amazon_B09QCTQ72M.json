However, if you want to use the mics in a PA setting, you'll find that the mics are essentially omnidirectional and very prone to feedback problems. This was a dealbreaker for me, but for many applications they would be a good solution. Setup is super simple and the sound quality is pretty good. I can't comment on battery life because of the feedback issues mentioned earlier.",

I am doing interviews at events where you do not get a redo so easily go to look at the videos, and the sound is messed up or not coming through. The adapter that you have to put on your phone gets super hot and in turn makes your phone hot and for whatever reason as you can see the result it just does not work. I would really like my money back. Or a replacement with better mics that they know work, these should not be sold.",

The only think that is a problem is that within the configuration that we were trying to use it (connected to a computer and also ported out to external speakers) that we had static noise coming through the external speakers. And our director didn't like that. So I was unable to use for the initial purpose.We haven't had time to test out in other environments as of yet.",

                "reviewText": "Alvoxcon Dual Handheld Mic's use the UM-320 receiver. It appears to be a dual channel receiver as each of the mics can be set to one of 20 frequencies here in the USA. In addition, I was able to pair an Alvoxcon UM 310 Pro lapel mic with the system and run three microphones simultaneously. In watching the five lights on the receiver the one nearest the USB plug turns blue when the receiver is plugged in to a USB port. Each of the microphones will turn on two of the next four lights. So, light 2 and 3 are one channel and 4 and 5 are the second channel. I was able to run the lapel mic on the 2 and 3 channel with one of the handheld mics. I did find that the mic on the second channel (lights 4 and 5) was over modulating. I could not find any way to turn down the sensitivity of that channel. I tried changing the frequency of the channel but that did not happen. Running just the second mic did not resolve the issue with the sensitivity. Running the first mic and the lapel mic did not seem to compromise the signal or quality of the sound.It appears that the user will need to keep the second mic further away from their mouth to compensate for the sensitivity of the mic.Considering the capability of these mic's the sound quality through the system was very good.",

I tried to connect the transmitter (needs to be attached to power source) to aux in and mic in and both worked. The charging cable has two prongs for the two microphones. But no power adapter. The microphone design is really well-thought of. I am very satisfied with the microphone system. The mic will need to be closer to your mouth for great sound. I am writing this review to help others decide. I benefit much from what others have to say, so, I am just returning the favor.",
