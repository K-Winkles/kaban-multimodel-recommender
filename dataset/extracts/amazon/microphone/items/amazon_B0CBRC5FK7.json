                "reviewText": "First of all, I was very impressed with the look and design of the case and the earbuds. The white case with silver around the outer edge looks really nice.Upon opening the case, I was pleasantly surprised to find the earbuds were charged and ready for use! Definitely a bonus to not have to wait to charge before the first use!I am also very pleased with the feel of the earbuds. They fit my ear perfectly. These earbuds are light weight enough that I almost don\u2019t even notice I am wearing them. I am someone who is very active, and I love to listen to music or a podcast while walking, running, gardening, and working. I typically use earbuds that wrap around my ear because I feel they typically stay in place better. After comparing many different earbuds and researching for a long time, I decided to give these a try. I am so happy I did! They have stayed perfectly in place while walking the dog, bending down to pull weeds in the garden, running, and many more activities. Over all, I would give these ear buds an A+ for comfort and for staying in place, which is of utmost importance for me!As far as usage, pairing was a breeze. Literally within seconds of opening the package, I had them paired with my phone. I often like to use only one earbuds while working, so I am able to hear when someone is talking to me, but also have music or a podcast going. I have used these with both the right and the left ear at once, and with just one ear in. Either way has worked smoothly and the transition between using one ear to using two ears is smooth, as well. I like that there is a C style charging cable included. I have so many other devices that use a c style cable, so it\u2019s convenient to be able to plug in and charge almost any where in my house or car.As far the sound quality, everything sounds good to me! I haven\u2019t had any troubles with sound quality whether I\u2019m listening to music, watching a tv show or movie, or listening to a podcast. As far as I\u2019m concerned, the sounds quality is perfect.Another quality that is really important to me when purchasing ear buds is the distance they with transmit ( forgive me if that isn\u2019t the correct term\u2026I\u2019m not very techy). I don\u2019t like to always carry my phone with me around the house or office, so I love if I can be a long way from my phone and not get disconnected or have the sounds get crackly. I noticed I could really walk all around my house and even outside without having any troubles. I decided to try a little experiment outside and see how far I could get from my phone without disconnecting or crackling. I was absolutely shocked to learn that I could walk a full two hundred and seventy feet away from my phone before I even heard the slightest bit of crackling! Considering I couldn\u2019t even walk from one room to the next in my house with me old ear buds, I feel like that is a truly impressive distance!Overall, I am super happy with this purchase!",

Plenty of volume when needed too. Very comfortable to wear and overall an incredible value for a low price. These ear buds perform as good or better than others I've had that cost three times more. Definitely pick these up you won't be disappointed!",

                "reviewText": "So after an unfortunate incident involving my AirPods, I decided to go on the hunt for a budget friendly pair of headphones/earbuds. I happened to stumble across these and with a coupon was able to snag the beige pair for under $20. They were quick to arrive and were easy to pair with my phone. The headphones are so comfortable in my ears. Both the pieces that go in your ear, as well as the piece that wraps around the back of your ear are so comfortable! I didn't and have yet to get a headache from them and I wear them daily while doing house chores. They are more noise cancelling than my AirPods which is nice for most people but is a little hard when I am wearing only one so I can hear my small children. I love that it informs you of an incoming call and I love the color of them. The case is nice and the feature showing the battery life has been nice as well. Also....the battery life on these is SO GOOD. They have been lasting me forever even after using them for over 2 weeks, and everyday for hours sometimes I still have 45 percent battery life in the case portion. My AirPods would have needed to be charged way before this. Overall I am in love with these and would purchase again in a heart beat, as well as recommend this product to friends and family.",

                "reviewText": "These are my 2nd pair of wireless Bluetooth earphones from this brand. The case broke on the first pair due to a stupid mistake. Bought this pair because I knew the product was great. This model is a bit upgraded from my last pair. Sleaker and smaller design. The sound is great for the price. Cheap earphones can have a hollow or tinny sound. These don't. The sound can be a little muddled at times but it's not terribly distracting either. If you're looking for affordable earphones with great battery life and good sound, then these will definitely suit you. Also, phone calls are clear with these.",

The sound great, fit great, and the case seems very well made. I love the LED screen on the front of it that shows that each earbud is charging and shows the total battery level of the case itself.They literally just arrived an hour ago, so these are my first impressions. I will update this review as necessary, but I have high hopes for these earbuds. They look great, feel great, and sound great out of the box.",
