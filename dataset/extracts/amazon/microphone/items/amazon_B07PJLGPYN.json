                "reviewText": "I was skeptical about this product because of the price, and I will admit it's not the sturdiest setup in the world, but it is durable. I've travelled with it globally in checked luggage with no damage or disfigurement. Most importantly, it is very impressive at blocking room ambience. I find the best results when I place the condenser mic deep within the arms, fold them around close, and in more noisy environments place a towel over the top. Noise reduction foam triangles on the inside are thick and sturdy. Pop screen arm is a good length, very flexible, and retains its position very well. Good buy overall, especially for a beginner.",

Foam is good quality, shield arrived a bit damaged. One of the small legs around the perimeter of the bottom of the shield came bent and the metal was dented. Was not a problem for me as i wont be using the shield by itself. Various reviews on here of recieving damaged stands so if you order just pray it doesnt come too damaged. I got lucky. Great for beginner home studios but if you can afford better do not cheap out.",

                "reviewText": "Look you have to understand that this is what it is... and that is a PART of a solution to minimalize the negative acoustic factors in a space (echoing, feedback, external noise.) That being said, I still utilize this in a walk-in closet where I allow the clothing to be a part of the solution. My testing certainly indicates that this isolation shield/stand DOES HELP however particularly with regards to echo reduction. For my current home studio needs it does the job. It is portable enough to (carefully) move it from my main studio space to my closet when needed. I will say that it is quite well built and very effectively supports my Blue Yeti microphone and pop filter, as well as all of my condenser mics. Occasionally I choose to suspend the microphones rather than mounting them upright... no problems here at all. Just invert the shield on the stand and it works perfectly! At $119.00 this was a very cost effective tool to help improve the sound of my recordings. It is not a whisper room substitute and not meant to be. I would quantify it as a reasonably effective noise suppression tool. I am quite satisfied!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this shield and stand In the middle of the Corona crisis because voice over agency's were preferring that you had your own Home set up. For the past few years I've just been auditioning from home in my voice over box. I like the sturdiness of this stand and it allows me to stand up fully. The legs are strong and carry the weight of the isolation shield, so its never leans. It was easy to put together, and is actually kind of heavy. The sound quality is OK. Im sure that has a lot to do with me recording in an open carpeted room as opposed to a closet. The major complaint is that to pop guard will not stay on the pole. IT keeps slipping off as there was no hole for it to screw in to. SO sometimes Im actually holding the pop guard as Im recording, or I don't use it altogether, which sucks because it really does help with the P's and T's. Overall, it was a great purchase especially for the money.",

                "reviewText": "If you're looking for a sturdy heavy-duty mic stand that can handle the weight of that bulky Blue Yeti or G Track Pro mic, look no further! Very easy to install and adjust shield, didn't even need to look at the instructions. It comes with an allen key and two screws to install the mount on the sound shield. Other than that everything is all done by hand. Also, if whatever shockmount you have doesn't go on the mic mount part there's an adapter on the tip of it that screws off, remove it to screw on your shockmount if the threading doesn't match. Considering this stand can handle my G Track Pro with shockmount you should not have to worry about tipping, but if you're really on the cautious side you should be fine put a sand bag or weight on the bottom tripod bracers. Buy it, you won't regret it.",

I tried out the microphone for a little and it recorded sounds and did a decent job of it, I have other microphones that I like way better so my experience was limited with it. best I can say is I got a working item and in a pinch, I now have 1 more spare. the shield and stand are great and do the job of well in my makeshift recoding area. I do voice work mostly so if you are a singer I can't rate it for that. I found that I can adjust it well enough to get my microphone just where I want it no matter which mic I use. overall this was worth the money.",

I'm guessing, more the latter. I took it inside my music room and saw that it was definitely mishandled, because some of the wrapping was half off of it, then to my surprise, the back had finger prints all over it and a giant scratched up part. Thankfully, aesthetically, it still looks good since I don't have to look at it from behind. But it was definitely damaged, as you can see in the picture, it was really scratched up. Product-wise, it's amazing. It's stylish, looks pro, and way less expensive than completely foaming my music room up to acoustically treat it.",
