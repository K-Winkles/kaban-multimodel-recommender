                "reviewText": "ZealSound tabletop USB Microphone Quick Mute Noise Cancel model K66The mic looks and feels nice. Weighted stand makes it unlikely to topple.Connection was easy. Plug cord into mic and into USB on computer or USB-C on Android. I did not test it on iPhone.On my Dell computer, I recorded a little audio using Audacity. Then I compared the sound to my ZealSound wireless lavalier mic V7 pro. At first I had the K66 mic volume high, and there was a noticeable background hiss. Then I turned it down to a lower volume, and the hiss was much less, at an acceptable level for basic recording jobs, about the same as the V7 pro. The voice sound of the K66 was clear and sharp, whereas the V7 pro had a slightly muffled sound. I do not know how they would sound on an iOS machine.I then tested the K66 on my Samsung A33 Android. It connected quickly. Voice recording was excellent! There was virtually no detectable background hiss, and the voice sound was clear and sharp. I do not know why the sound quality is better when recording on the Android.Touching or handling the mike introduced rattling noise, as is the case for most inexpensive mics, I think. And the sound is of course better if the sound source is close to the mic and the recording volume is as low as possible to obtain a good result while reducing background hiss to a minimum. The manual recording level control of the K66 is nice; it eliminates the annoying increase in background noise that begins after a short bit of silence on most mics which have automatic recording volume control.I would recommend this mic if you need a tabletop model, and especially if you want to use your phone for recording. Good value for the money.",

                "reviewText": "Every podcaster needs extra mics for those extra guests in the studio. This mic fits the bill exactly. It is well constructed, looks good in video, and is a desktop mic with adjustable angle. It connects via a USB Type C on the mic end to the computer via USB Type A. It has knobs for mute, mic gain and echo. It comes with a foam cover, USB cable, and two adapters.The first test of recording while speaking from a script went very well. The recording quality was excellent, and noise cancellation was admirable in addition. The \"echo\" is a misnomer - it should have been \"reverb\". Reverb can be added as needed by turning the knob and is a nice feature. Mic gain too can be adjusted as needed.The second test was recording a song with voice and guitar and it failed miserably (as expected), completely canceling out the guitar and muffling the song. If you plan to use this to record music, you will need to turn off the noise cancellation. To do this, go to settings, sound, k66 microphone properties and ensure that audio enhancements are set to off. You can now record flawlessly across the frequency spectrum. I liked the quality of music recorded. In the properties menu, the maximum sampling is 16 bits, 48kHz which is quite sufficient for home recordings.Recommended!",

At least until you hit that point when you're looking to step all your equipment up.One thing I read elsewhere, and stood out immediately to me, as it did to those people, the mute button is clear, yet the light is placed above the button. That truly doesn't make much sense, as you can see the button easier, while the small light as it is, you may not see depending on the way you have the mic situated.You will get decent quality sound from this, but I wouldn't hold out for singing the next hit single of the world, although if you listen to some of the sounds out there, you just might.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Here's a quick review of the ZealSound K66 USB microphone. Like most cheap USB microphones, this has a completely plastic construction from the base right down to the control knobs. That said, the microphone still has fairly decent weight and feels relatively solid. At the front of the unit, there's the controls for things like microphone gain, monitor headphone volume, echo volume, and a mute button. I liked the resistance of the control knobs and they definitely don't feel as flimsy as others I have tried in this price range. At the bottom, there's a USB-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack. The unit includes a fairly long 6ft USB-C cable which works fantastic in my case.In Windows 11, the microphone is completely plug and play. During my testing, the recording volume is impressive and I get good sound speaking normally at 8 to 12 inches away. As such, this will absolutely work as a desktop microphone without need of a microphone arm. Do note that the absolute top of the microphone needs to be pointed towards your mouth for the best results. I wish they would show this as an illustration in the manual because microphones like the Blue Yeti Nano require you to speak into the controls/logo side. Within Windows, my input volume was set to 100% and the gain dial on the microphone was set a little bit below max to avoid clipping.What I did like is that this microphone records in stereo, and there is a noticeable quality boost over mono-only microphones. I am happy with overall capture quality. Even when compared against the much more expensive Yeti Nano, my recordings sounded quite good. However, I do still think the Yeti Nano has a slight edge in how natural it sounds.The microphone has an Echo dial which was set to max by default. This essentially makes you sound like you are speaking in a big auditorium. I'm not sure why this is featured on this microphone.I read a review stating that the headphone volume dial does not work. It definitely does in my case and I can control how loud I want to hear my own recording through that port.Lastly, I tested how the microphone handles background noise. I made a recording while having some music running in the background. Unfortunately, it captured pretty much everything. You will need a very quiet environment to use this microphone. If you are gaming, you will need to put on headphones.Overall, I think the K66 is a good microphone with decent build quality and good capture quality. It's one of the few that works well even at a similar distance to the Yeti Nano. The only thing against it would be lack of Environmental Noise Cancellation (ENC) which isn't an expectation at this price point. Definitely worth a look if you are on a budget.",

                "reviewText": "I like being able to monitor my voice with this, it really helped me understand what my voice sounds like.I'm very new to using anything other than a built in mic. At first I tried it with an external hub, because it was easier, but this did give some weird noise in my recordings. Sounded like the radar sounds in a submarine, which was confusing and a little disorienting. I'm glad that I tried the mic directly plugged in to the computer as well. Because I wasn't sure what was going on.After I plugged it into the computer directly (laptop), these sounds disappeared. I however thought my voice sounded like talking into a can, I'm not an expert, so I'm not sure if there is a way to clean up the sound or not. When you first get the microphone, all the volume nobs are way up. This includes echo, monitor and mic, not sure why they would do this.I found it strange that the USB port on the bottom didn't insert all the way, so the USB-c stuck out way more than I would expect. If you remove the mic foam, I would say the build construction seems decent, a bit more plasticky than I would prefer though.I used two programs to test my voice, one was Audacity and the other was the standard sound recorder that comes with Windows. I don't really have a way to compare this to any others as this is my first stand alone mic. It definitely sounds way better than using the mic on your phone. I experimented with speaking directly in and having the mic off to the side when recording my voice and I thought it sounded less like speaking into a can then. So my recording technique might be off. Again, I'm very new to external mics.I found the noise cancelling to be okay, you can access that by holding the top button for a few seconds until it lights up blue. Not to be confused with the on blue light above the button, which simply means on/open and red/mute.The headphone volume did work for me, but only if it was for recorded audio playback. But if I was listening to a video online, the headphone volume adjustment didn't work, but the computer one did, even though it was relaying to my headphones.Overall, I think this is a good entry level mic. Okay quality. Definitely a step up from using built-in mics from your devices.",

                "reviewText": "This ZealSound USB Microphone makes recording vocals, content creation, and live meetings a lot simpler with plug & play design to capture both audio and listen using passthrough 3.5mm audio jack. Build quality is a pearly white aesthetic made of rigid plastic with weighted down stand ideal for tabletop usage.// Sound QualitySound quality is surprisingly clean & crisp on mid tonal frequencies but limited by 44.1 kHz input frequency at 16 Bit ratio over USB digital to analog converter module embedded within this Microphone. Some high notes do pop which can be avoided with a filter but doesn't come with one.Reducing the gain helps significantly minimize noise but also requires placing it between 5 and 10 inches away at a precise angle for capturing audio. It's cardoid pickup pattern is focused on top instead of front buttons. This does require positioning angle where buttons are inconveniently pointed downwards making controls rather cumbersome to use.One downside is lack of mounting options requiring attaching onto the included double sided thumbscrew stand with no option for 1/4\" tripod screw or standard microphone boom arms.// Build QualityBuild quality is durable for an entry level Microphone, it's made entirely of plastic enclosure finished in a pearl white color that looks aesthetically premium. Base measures approximately 4.5\" inch in diameter with total height reaching 10.25\" inches tall.Tabletop stand is also plastic but contains inside a heavy metal weight to hold this microphone firmly in place after running cables. The bottom rubber protects desk surfaces and has ample grip from sliding.Foam is mostly an aesthetic cover with no effect on reducing wind noise and its enclosure is also not weatherproof limiting its versatility for recording outdoors or while traveling.// ConfigurationPlug & Play design makes it easy to setup with no additional drivers required on Windows 10, device manager shows it as a K66 USB Microphone with Digital Audio Input up to 44 KHz and passthrough Audio Output for listening to content playback alongside recording. This microphone also works with OBS or recording software on Linux just as well.The included cable is a premium USB Type C to USB Type A connector and can be converted to either USB Type C again or Lightning with two provided adapters. It's awesome to have the convenience of using this microphone on laptops for podcasts or jump over to doing calls from Smartphones. An EMF bead is pre-attached on the USB Type A connector which helps reduce outside interference and stabilizes sound quality.Overall it makes a decent entry level plug & play cardoid recording microphone for podcasting, capturing voice overs, or streaming with multiple adjustment control knobs & headset audio out pass through. Having total flexibility over input gain, 3.5mm headset output volume, and USB Type A/C connectors with included adapters makes this microphone convenient to use across different devices.",

                "reviewText": "This mic was essentially plug and play and worked flawlessly out of the box.The sound of the mic was clear and the features were great. The volume adjustment on the mic worked fine too and I was able to adjust how loud my voice was. The sensitivity of the mic was great too and it seems like my voice could be easily picked up from different angles as the advertisement suggests.The echo feature on the mic was certainly a fun addition but I did not see any practical use for it. The noise cancellation feature wasn't as good as it was advertised but I think this is isn't a huge deal as my voice still went through loud and clear.",
