                "reviewText": "In my radio business, and my 25 year singing career, you can bet I have used a lot of studio condenser mics. My husband had done many months of research and along with my advice purchased the MXL 990's for our studio here and they are truly stellar! Hell, even \"The Stern Show\u2122\" uses them!Anyway, we needed some variety hubby said, we needed a \"collection\" for the many different voice types we have in studio as guest hosts and show guests come and go all the time.Well, I suggested he go with the CAD GXL 3000's as they certainly in my opinion are one of the best out there. Well, hubby with all his \"tech specs\" and lingo said that the response from these 2200's are VERY close to the 990'sWell, against my wishes purchased these as well as the 3000's and let me tell you, they are excellent. VERY close to the 990's but I feel there is more of a high end punch with these and it's a very good mic.PROS:Construction is solid, with a small but very good shockmount. Excellent quality finish applied to the outer casing for a nice look and I'm sure a long life.The sound is as I said crisp, clear with very nice highs and mids.When I tested, we ran through just our mixer, with no compression of effects and a small amount of EQ as we run our shows. All in all a very nice addition to our studio collection.CONS:The ONLY con I have was the packaging. Just a thin cardstock box with nothing more than small plastic airbags around it for shipping. It does come with a vinyl zip case for the mic itself, but nothing for the shockmount. Not a huge issue, but when compared with the MXL 990 that comes with a solid plastic road case, heavy foam insulation and a very nice quality presentation along with the useability of professional grade portability, it's a bit weak.Other than packaging, this is a solid studio condenser for voice and we highly recommend it!",

The microphone sounds better for record9ing than the $300 Shure mic that I have which is more of a live mic for playing out. I purchased for I took some time off recording and playing music and was getting back into recording, but did not want to spend $5-$600 bucks on a mic if I feud that I was not using it a lot.I read reviews about this mic and went for it, and am just passing the message along to other budget minded musicians, or what ever your need is for a mic you will not be disappointed. The only thing I wonder is how can they make such a good quality piece, ...Asia.Who cares where its made, its a good mic for a few dollars, and is a nice addition to many a home studio/podcast u name it.",

                "reviewText": "Relatively awesome mic for the price point. I had been doing research on condenser microphones withing this price range for a few months before deciding to bite the bullet, so to speak, and purchase a set of these.Build Quality: Initial reaction, pretty solid. They have a nicely balanced weight to them and everything seems to be put together fairly well. Because I'm curious and ever the tinkerer I decided to take one apart and check out the inner workings. Sadly, inside the craftsmanship seems to take a small hit. Specifically, there was an ever so slightly loose screw in one, but that could just be from the shipping. And the components and wires inside aren't super high quality. I wouldn't say it's a deal breaker though, considering the true test for a mic is in the sound quality, but keep in mind you do get what you pay for in terms of build.Sound Quality: Much nicer than I expected. Again, these mics are fairly inexpensive, but they sound great. I'm running them through a Behringer Xenyx, but even on completely stock settings the sound quality is quite warm and rich. I was really surprised, I was half expecting them to come out sort of tinny and that I'd have to really EQ them to make them sound nicer but that was not the case.Final Say: If you're in the market for some inexpensive mics for a small podcast or some voice over work, you could do much worse than these.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this mic about 6 years ago and will still use it from time to time. It has been tossed about quite a bit and has held up excellently. The sound is neutral with great clarity and I prefer it over some more expensive mics for percussion (room mic or things like bongos or shakers). It sounds good for vocals and guitar as well, but I have more expensive mics that I prefer for those tasks. However, if you can only have one mic, you really can't go wrong with this for the price. Being a large diaphragm cardioid it will pick up lots of background noise, so if you work in a noisy environment this may not be the mic for you. Also be aware of squeaking chairs and other room noise, because you can be sure those will be picked up with this mic as well!",

                "reviewText": "I am in the process of piecing together my own home studio and I had been back and forth over what kind of condenser mic to go with. Being on a budget often makes one mindful, because you don't want to break the bank, but you also don't to end up with an album that sounds like it was recorded with a cassette player, so reviews are a penny-pincher's best friend. I was leaning towards a higher-end MXL, but I did not have enough confidence built up in the reviews. Now i currently own a Samson C01 usb mic, and have been pretty well pleased with it, but it never had that crisp, flat sound I was looking for vocally and acoustically. Thats when I ran across this awesome deal. I hook it up to my Behringer Xenyx mixer and this mic brings my stuff to life. Has an awesomely crisp sound and a really nice flat response vocally. My only complaint is that the shock mount is really flimsy and easily broken. Mine actually came with a stripped out screw in it. Thats where the CAD customer service blew me away. I called at 8:00 on a Wednesday, explained the situation, (And wasn't transferred to 8 different departments), the dude sent me another shock mount with no questions asked. I had it by 12:00pm on Saturday. Will forever be a CAD customer now. THIS MIC IS WORTH A SHOT!",

                "reviewText": "Cad Gxl2200 Cardioid Condenser Microphone, Champagne I'am a Song composer as well as a singer.I use this great microphone for recording almost everything.with this mic i will say \"made me sound like 'ME' \"They have good 'presence' even if the sound source is as far as 2 feet away.This is just an all-around good mic with great sound for the cost.*Just be aware that this mic requires 48 volt 'phantom power' to operate. So you have to use something like an M-Audio USB prepay/interface or Scarlett audio interface so that it can provide the Phantom Power to the mic. This mic will NOT work with a portable tape recorder or a Public Address Amplifier without inserting a Phantom Power Supply in the line.Also, it comes with a shock mount for a reason. This is NOT intended to be a handheld microphone. It will pick up every thump, bump, and slide motion made by a person's hands. It NEEDS to mounted on a mic stand WITH the shock mount. Otherwise it will pick up vibrations from people walking on the floor. It is VERY sensitive. I can use it in my living room to record the wind chimes out on my front porch 40 feet away.As for vocals, it will give a good amount of base as well as the high frequencies (Frequency response: 30Hz to 20kHzSensitivity: -36dBV (16mV) at 1 Pa). It has a cardioid polar pattern.I once recorded a friend playing piano, but before we could get started we had to shut off her refrigerator in the kitchen and unplug her electric clock because this mic could hear the clock motor humming (which we could not hear with our normal ears).I would say the quality is as good as the AT 2020 (AT 2020 is slightly better but keeping cost in mind!)The internal noise is very low because of a very good pre-amp (no need to add more gain in the audio interface)But if you want to pickup every nuance of an acoustic guitar being played .... THIS is the right mic for it!Note : It looks sexy in that Champagne finished body :D",
