You have to configure the virtual pedals in order to boost the microphone signal to an instrument level signal. I'm still fine tuning my configuration, but this pedal setup seems to work really well to give a karaoke effect on your vocals.- Booster Drive Pedal: gain 10- Fishboy Amp: gain 10, volume 10- Digital Chorus Pedal: E level 5, tone 5- Vintage Delay Pedal: repeat rate 1/8, intensity 3.0, echo 3.0- Room Studio A Reverb Pedal: level 4.0, time 3.0I bound this custom configuration to my \"custom\" hardware preset button, so it's really easy to set up. The volume is not as loud as my guitar would be through the amp, but it's definitely loud enough for an apartment or household karaoke setting. Vocals are still super clear after going through two gain stages, I haven't noticed any distortion. The Fishboy virtual amp setting handles vocals really well and gives a natural vocal tone.",

The con is they do give a buzz when volune is high on all the mixers i have tried, including my ddj s1 controller. The reciever turns off after a while on its own and I am guessing it is to save bettery power. The mics, once turned on, take a second or two to connect to the reciever and pass sound through. Other than that they sound clear and give a more professional look. Def good back up mics or karaoke mics. Great for mobile djs. Rechargeable batteries work on these. Not heavy so most likely delicate on accidental drops.",

Hab\u00eda comprado en otra plataforma pero se atrasaron en el env\u00edo, as\u00ed que prefer\u00ed comprar en Amazon para que llegaran en la fecha que los necesitaba.",

                "reviewText": "I was excited on this JBL mic to go perfectly with my JBL1000 when I'm hosting events, the sound quality is really good!However, unfortunately it let me down right from the first use.1. The power button on the mic is too sensitive, it turns off/on on a slight touch which is a disadvantage especially that they made the switch button too low so there's very minimal space to hold the mic below the button.2. Once turned off, it automatically changes to a different channel which in turn disrupts the connection to the receiver (maybe?)3. The advertized distance to the receiver is >10m range but im just 5m away with no interference of some kind from where im standing up to the mic receiver but it is already dropping outI wish I could return but the box was totally torn apart and thrown away. In general, this is a good mic just not to be used on highly active environment like hosting, karaoke, games or similar activities",
