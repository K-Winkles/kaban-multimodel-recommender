The periods last for about 10 seconds and appear at random in the recordings. The recordings are unusable when this occurs. I am not moving on to Adobe Audition and will see what happens.

                "reviewText": "First off, this mic is super easy to use straight out of the box. I purchased an external interface (Scarlett Solo) just in case the built-in interface didn\u2019t produce as good of a sound. Did comparison records and I could hear a slight difference between connecting directly via usb-c vs using the external interface. It was so close though that I didn\u2019t know which was better, both had great clarity and sound quality. One friend thought the \u201cwithout interface\u201d sounded clearer and crisper, but two professionals whom I sent my clips to liked the \u201cwith interface\u201d sound better and said it was a clearer RAW sound for me. Without the interface, it sounds slightly bass-y, like it's gone through a post-edit and been slightly Eq'd. I recorded in a walk-in closet using a reflector shield and the built in pop filter and you don't hear a \u201cfloor\u201d. Suggestion... use the USB-C for when you travel (it'll do well in a pinch to just have the mic and laptop) and keep the interface set up in your home studio - love this versatility. Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, there\u2019s nowhere to plug in headphones if using the USB-C, so I do prefer using with the Scarlett interface. But I\u2019m puzzled why this mic is $20 cheaper than the previous 4th generation that doesn\u2019t have the built in interface option. Nevertheless, very happy with this mic and my new home studio set up.",

I was able to hear my natural voice crisp and clean, but bc the USB Type C is smaller than my SkyTech PC tower's regular USB ports and USB Port 3.0, I heard a little noise if I hear headphones for the audio or I didn't talk in certain parts of my vid, My speculation could be is bc I didn't have an audio box that can properly fit it into my PC's USB ports.",

Originally, I went with 2 blue yeti x microphones but after days of fussing with the settings I wasn't able to get the sound that I wanted. I turned to this Rode microphone after reading and watching rave reviews for its ease of use and sound quality. I spent 5 minutes setting up both microphone and am extremely pleased with the sound quality. Don't buy blue yeti, spend the extra 100 and get this instead.",
