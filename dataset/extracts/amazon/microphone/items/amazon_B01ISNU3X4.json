Easy on/off switch on handle. Good quality cord with standard connector ends and good length. Even comes with windscreen. Attractive black with silver findings design. Great price, came next day with Prime, packed well in box. I'm considering buying another set for extra backup, I am that impressed with the quality. LOVE!",
