Anyway, this machine has 2 microphone jacks so i decided to get 2 so that someone else can sing along with my son. plugged it in, turned it on, put the microphone volume to 3 and started speaking into it while turning the main volume up. worked perfectly and problem solved. i recommend this cause it works well and if your kids destroy it it didn't cost you and arm an a leg.",

                "reviewText": "I bought the microphone specifically to use for my karaoke speaker. Note my speaker's volume isn't very loud but I noticed I have to put my mouth very close to the microphone for my voice to be apparent. Maybe it's my speaker's volume that affects this. Regardless the microphone was a good price and works fine. The cord is long enough to walk around or give yourself space.",
