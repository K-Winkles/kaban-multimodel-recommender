Both were immediately detected by my system, but the Audio Technica shines in the following areas: - build: solid, heavy construction - recording quality: no adjustment necessary; I worried about it having no gain control but I did not need to fuss with it at all - great soft touch mute button; the Sennheiser has one too but you can't miss with this oneI returned the Sennheiser; with that one I had to keep the Gain at 100% to have a decent volume sot there is no point in having the Gain control in that case!Strongly recommend the AT2020USB-X !!",

It installs and is ready for action in seconds (just plug and play) and the sound quality even without purchasing the stand and isolating cradle is superb.The unusual thing for me is that the mike includes its own headphone jack, which must be used during microphone use. It makes sense as the mikke has a balance control for the phones right on it and I don't mind re-pluging my (Audio Technica, of course) headphones into the mike when recording.It's a great product, very popular, and deservedly so.",

It was immediately recognized by my chromebook and discord as the default microphone, which was super great! works right out of the box! The only reason I'm not keeping it is because i don't own any audio editing software and can't adjust gain so it picks up EVERYTHING. I bought a maono mic for 1/4th of the price that had a gain control dial which suits my personal needs better. I will say, the knobs for adjusting the volume on your headphones as well as the one to control how much of your voice or your device's audio you hear is SUPER convenient. I would recommend this mic for people who are a bit more serious about podcasting/voice overs/singing/etc. Pretty good mic overall in terms of quality, just not the mic for me :)",
