                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Originally I'd tested an $80 Rode Lavalier Go microphone on the Zoom H1n and it was terrible. The noise floor was way too high and the mic required too much gain to capture my voice whilst fastened to my chest. I promptly returned that microphone and bought this one...I took a chance on this since it delivered same day and it was so cheap and it just performed beautifully. I own six different lav mics from several top brands, and this one is easily comparable to them (better than some). I only added about 3 notches of gain and I could hear myself clearly with very little white noise. I could easily gate out the noise floor...We'll see how it fairs in the long term, as I've only just received it, but so far this lav mic has left a very good impression. Especially considering all of the extra kit included with the mic. (replacement filters, extension cable, and TRRS to TRS converter)\"noise cancellation is on your phone, not the mic\"just fyi... these reviewers complaining about \"noise cancellation\" need to educate themselves on audio gear. I don't think they understand that acoustical noise cancellation is a software algorithm installed on their smart phones, the microphone is merely built to support it. You can turn it off on your smartphone. It is not a feature of the microphone.If I don't take care to keep my gain down, this microphone will pickup everything in the area with no problem, that's because my zoom recorder has no acoustical noise cancellation. You can hear this in my recording. (if amazon will ever allow me to post it.)\"the mic survives minor bumps and drops just fine.\"furthermore, there is another review complaining their microphone died after dropping it 3 feet. I was concerned about that so I gave mine a few test drops 5ft and light smacks onto a marble floor. works fine. I think they're either downplaying the severity of their abuse or got a defective model and should've filed a warranty claim rather than whining on amazon.hope this helps!",

I had a replacement shipped to my house within a few days for no additional charge. So far the replacement mic is working well.This mic is very sensitive in comparison to a laptop or tablet mic and has very good sound quality. It can pick up my voice from several feet away even when speaking softly (of course it helped that I tried this in a quiet room).Be aware, if you use it on a smartphone, Apple or Android, once connected you will not get any sound output. These devices treat the mic as a headset, but of course it has no output. I have not yet checked the app stores to see if there might be an app that could get around this limitation.On a computer, though, you can use this for audio input while using another device for output (assuming your computer has the correct hardware to do so). The caveat is that not all audio jacks are the same so you may need to use an included adapter (adapts the connector to TRS instead of TRRS). In addition, the operating system might get confused (I had different results on each Win 10 computer I plugged this into!). Honestly, if your primary use is computer (PC or Mac) you're probably better off getting a USB based mic - it will likely be less hassle.That said, I am happy with this purchase, particularly because of the customer service. I plan to use it for video conferencing meetings and presentations.",

                "reviewText": "I bought the PowerDeWise lavalier microphone because I needed a high-quality microphone to record my videos across different disciplines and for various platforms. I'm really happy with the purchase, as the microphone has a very clear and crisp sound. The cable is long and sturdy, but the 4-pin jack has given me slight issues after a year of use; there are certain tricks to make it work without problems. The microphone is omnidirectional, so it captures sound well from any angle. Additionally, the clip is very practical for attaching it to clothing, and the windshield prevents excessive wind or breath sounds.The packaging is very nice and gives you a sense of special ownership, a point for the brand. It feels like they've sent you a personalized gift. I think it's a microphone worth buying and recommending.I was impressed by its versatility, as it can be used for recording videos, making video calls, and I even use it for streaming. It's a microphone that adapts to any situation and need.However, it's important to note that being an omnidirectional microphone, it tends to pick up a lot of background noise. Therefore, it's recommended to use filters in software programs or audio editing programs to clean the sound and enhance the quality. This might be a drawback for some users who prefer a simpler and more direct microphone.If you're looking for a high-quality professional lapel microphone, the PowerDeWise lavalier microphone is an ideal choice.",

I appreciate the quality and reliability that this cost-effective product has provided me with. While some other tech products with grand promises and hyped-up marketing have conked out on me within a few months, this PowerDeWise mic has stood strong for me out there on the road during my travels, so I have no problem recommending them 100%. I will also be purchasing their interview set next.",

                "reviewText": "I typically off board my sound recording via a RODE NT1 via an interface directly in to logic when doing commercial recording, however for a job I wasnt able to do that - so made the investment in to this fairly cheap wired lav mic. Sound quality is brilliant, really good low end which is what I love when recording voices, mid and high end is tamed very well too. Post production didnt need too much to be honest, a little EQ and a touch of compression to catch some peaks (but thats down to the person speaking) - In camera, i reduced the audio gain to around -9db and found this so be the perfect spot - I also monitor the audio in realtime whilst filming, and initially I was picking up all sorts of bleed, but once we stoped filming the bleed wasnt there, so im assuming the onboard compression/gate took care of that - which saved me another job in post! Would highly recommend if you're looking for a lav mic and dont mind it being wired!",
