Our two older kids like to sing with us and use real microphones because they understand the importance of taking care of expensive equipment. Our 2 yr old, however, doesn't quite understand that concept. I ordered these for her, so she could feel included in the music time, but not have the real microphones to accidentally break. They look legit and feel quite sturdy. We've been teaching her to be gentle with them and care for them like they are the real thing and so far, they are both still in tact. She can tell they don't put sound through the speakers though... ha! But, I'm impressed at the quality of these props. I'd recommend them.",
