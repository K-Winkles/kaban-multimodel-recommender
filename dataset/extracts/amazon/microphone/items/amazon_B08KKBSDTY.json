                "reviewText": "Pros:- LONG battery life. From a full charge, logged 9hrs while working from home and had 77% battery the next day. Great for those who may not be using this headset on a daily basis (or those who are and forget about charging daily!).- USB-C charging connectivity (A to C cable supplied, high quality, long length).- Lightspeed dongle is small and discrete.- Comfort: (YMMV... I'm a male in mid 20s with a medium sized head... I think?) after a few days of playing around with the ski band placement and earcup position, I finally found a setup that worked for me. I have stud earrings and found some higher positions of the earcups were originally pressing on my lobes and causing some discomfort. Switching the band to the larger position and bringing the earcups down allowed me to seat everything nicely without any discomfort. Wore the headphones all day while working from home and forgot I wasn't wearing my usual headphones (Beyerdynamic DT770... Which are my top choice for headphone comfort).- Logi GHub connectivity/customizations are decent. Simple volume, mic volume, sidetone (hearing your voice thru mic with no latency), audio EQ customization (with presets and custom settings)- Doesnt look super \"gamer-y\"... a good plus if I need video on during a (professional) call.- Flip to mute mic is great. I dont like having to deal with a removable mic or a fixed mic. The hardware based muting of the G535 mic is convenient and easy and doesnt require much finger dexterity... Allows me to mute on Discord or Teams while AFK.- Volume wheel and power button are smartly and intuitively placed and sized. Only a couple times have I accidentally brushed the volume wheel with the hood of my sweatshirt, but this only clicks the volume up a notch or two.Cons:- Noise cancelling is pretty weak. No active noise cancelling (but you wouldnt expect that at this price). Not much isolation from surrounding sounds, but this wasn't a large drawback for me as I play in relatively quiet environments- Mic quality: its a 2.4ghz wireless mic, so you have the usual downsides. Reduced high end, thinner bottom end. Its fine! But clarity suffers a little due to the intrinsic qualities of WIRELESS HEADSET technology. Please note that THIS MIC IS PERFECTLY FINE FOR GAMING, WORK CALLS, AND OTHER GENERAL COMMS PURPOSES!- Sound Quality: its fine! I do audio recording and mixing, so I'm biased when it comes to any set of headphones. My Beyerdynamic DT770 have a very wide soundstage, clear highs, articulated bass, and balanced mid range. I spend maybe 12 hours a day using the DT770s and love them for everything (aside from being wired). The G535 are fine for casual gaming, calls, video watching, and music listening. The default flat EQ is very acceptable, and I only tuned it a small amount to increase the high end, soften some mid range resonances, and add some weight in the low end. The stereo soundstage is a little muddy, but all wireless \"gaming\" headsets that I have tried in the past suffer from this- I would liken it to feeling like you are underwater and the sound is surrounding you equally and internally. Again, these headphones are PERFECTLY FINE for gaming, calls, video, and music. I wouldn't try to mix any audio, analyze new music, or try to take in a renowned movie soundtrack with this headset. Again I'm using my Beyerdynamic DT770s as reference here (the cadillac of headphones in my eyes)- they excel at being wired headphones with articulated qualities for music recording and mixing environments (and theyre great for CSGO with their better isolation qualities).- No bluetooth, but I have a pair of galaxy buds that I use with phone/laptop... And I can always throw the USB lightspeed dongle in my laptop and crack out the G535s!Overall verdict: The G535 are my first forray into wireless gaming headsets, and I am beyond impressed by what it offers (especially for $80 on sale)! It is adaptable to many head shapes and sizes (both youth and adult), has an incredible battery life, delivers good audio and mic quality for wireless headsets (better than cheaper $50 random brands), has great controls (both physical and software) without overwhelming the user or offering too much unnecessary functionality - very plug and play. I would definitely recommend this headset to anyone looking to make a worthwhile purchase without breaking the bank (say, the Gpro wireless).",

                "reviewText": "First, these headsets are great for those who use PC or Xbox One to game. I'm sure they can be used on anything that has a jack-in port.Side note for Xbox users: Don't get the dongle version of this headset if you have an Xbox One Gen 1. The USB ports don't work with any dongle devices.As long as I've been gaming, I've never invested in headphones. As far as first pairs go, I think it serves its purpose.The volume isn't the greatest, but I can't say if that's because of Xbox One, Discord settings, or the headphones itself. I don't mind that it has 0 noise-canceling features because it's safer that way. I've learned that noise-canceling devices can eliminate your awareness in emergencies (like if a family member needs help, or a fire happens in the house, etc.). While I know that it's unlikely those things will ever happen for some people, I live in a rough neighborhood where it pays to have all your senses present. Honestly, I can hear my friends just fine with them, but the unit doesn't have an eardrum-shattering volume. Probably for the best.I really like the way the set can be adjusted at the ear muff parts and at the head strap. I also appreciate that the mic can be turned off by just flipping the piece up. The way that the ear parts encapsulate my ears is also a nice feature. It's very plush, which is great for my sensitive ears. I can't use ear devices that insert into my ears--it causes massive pain in under 10 minutes, so having a device that never touches my ears, lets me play longer. The head strap is also a nice feature because it prevents the hard plastic portion from sitting on my head. If you've ever had the weight of a headset sit on your head for long periods of time, you know how much it can hurt.",

                "reviewText": "The blue and white color scheme SHOULD work, but it doesn't. This headset looks like I bought it in the bargain bin at Walmart.BUT!It works great. The noise cancellation is probably too good--I don't hear when my daughter wants to talk with me from down the hall. The sound is good and the headset is comfortable enough to wear for hours at a time.The one thing that I don't like is that the volume control resets itself to max loudness every time I start my computer. I.e., it doesn't \"remember\" the sound level I last chose. When someone calls me on Skype, I have to tear the headset off, the volume is so high.",

                "reviewText": "I had the Astro A10's for a few years and this last week they crapped out on me. Was going to get another set of A10's but the reviews for the gen 2's weren't that great, and these Logitech's had better reviews. Logitech owns Astro and I know both companies have great quality so I thought what the heck. These are super light weight and comfortable to wear. I can't say anything about the mic because I don't talk at all when gaming. The only complaint that I have (for now) is they lack bass. My A10's had some decent bass when playing Call of Duty and even watching YouTube with the headphones to be quiet. I really like these, but wish they had more bass. Maybe there's a way to turn it up but I haven't been able to find those settings yet.Long story short, these are a great buy and work perfectly.",

                "reviewText": "Quero comparar com outros headsets essa review porque acabei indo na onda de umas reviews que vi na internet, comprei um outro headset e me arrependi. A\u00ed se voc\u00eas est\u00e3o em d\u00favida entre alguns estilos de fone, quero deixar minha compara\u00e7\u00e3o direta para talvez ajudar.Decidi comprar esse logo depois que devolvi um HyperX Cloud II, que as pessoas falavam ser excelente, tanto em som quanto em conforto (oi?). Odiei o HyperX por ser pesado demais e a for\u00e7a do arco ser exagerada e fica aquele tipo de coisa que voc\u00ea fica muito consciente enquanto usa.Se voc\u00ea for como eu, e quer esquecer que est\u00e1 usando headset mesmo quando nem est\u00e1 escutando nada e usa o dia inteiro, tem que ser o G335 ou o HyperX Cloud Stinger Core (que \u00e9 o que eu tinha antes deste), que \u00e9 bem mais barato inclusive.Esses dois headsets s\u00e3o leves e n\u00e3o machucam a cabe\u00e7a (uso \u00f3culos). Headsets com o HyperX Cloud II me passam muito a vibe de fone que voc\u00ea vai usar se preparando para uma sess\u00e3o competitiva de Warzone, CS, etc, mas que s\u00e3o bem desconfort\u00e1veis por longos per\u00edodos.Para voc\u00ea jogar seu jogo single-player, pausar um pouco, dar play num v\u00eddeo de um canal e ir assim ao longo do dia, tem que ser um desses dois.Sobre a qualidade de \u00e1udio comparando com os outros dois:Lembrando que nenhum deles tem chiado ou ru\u00eddo por conta de compress\u00e3o. Mesmo os modelos mais b\u00e1sicos dessas marcas j\u00e1 est\u00e3o num padr\u00e3o acima de headsets de 50 reais.Cloud Stinger Core: tem foco mais em graves, o que \u00e9 bom para assistir v\u00eddeos pq deixa qualquer microfone mais aveludado. Pra jogos e m\u00fasica, as batidas t\u00eam impacto, mas \u00e0s vezes pode faltar um pouco do brilho. Se voc\u00ea muda para o G335 e volta para este, ele parece bem abafado em compara\u00e7\u00e3o, mas voc\u00ea reacostuma com esse som ser o normal em 10 minutos.G335: Para v\u00eddeos n\u00e3o \u00e9 t\u00e3o agrad\u00e1vel porque ele tem mais foco nos agudos. Algumas vozes ou microfones podem ficar meio irritantes; outras n\u00e3o muda tanto. Mas \u00e9 aquela coisa. No come\u00e7o estranhei. O som parece sair de jeito diferente, meio nasalado, mas agora j\u00e1 me acostumei e algumas vozes s\u00e3o de boa. Pensei que o agudo ia atrapalhar na m\u00fasica e nos jogos, mas n\u00e3o. Ficam muito bons na verdade. Nos jogos, ainda tem bastante grave nos impactos e m\u00fasicas tem mais brilho nesse.Cloud II: ele tem foco nos agudos e m\u00e9dios. Admito que \u00e9 o som mais limpo e aberto dos tr\u00eas. Vozes ficam num meio termo entre o Cloud Stinger e G335. S\u00e3o oks. Mas sinto que falta um corpo nos graves. Fica meio sem gra\u00e7a. Por isso que acho que ele \u00e9 voltado para FPS. Voc\u00ea escuta todo o metal e agudo de tiros e carregamento de armas.No fim, recomendo o G335 com certeza. O bom \u00e9 que ele n\u00e3o tampa tanto o som de fora (minha prefer\u00eancia), tem tecido nas almofadas em vez do couro e consegue te deixar imerso porque ele cobre bem ao redor das orelhas. \u00c9 um bom meio termo que d\u00e1 aquele conforto e prote\u00e7\u00e3o, mas sem deixar quente e pesado, como o Cloud II faz. Com Cloud II n\u00e3o consigo ficar imerso numa explora\u00e7\u00e3o de mapa ou algo assim, porque fico lembrando que ele est\u00e1 na minha cabe\u00e7a a cada 10 minutos e n\u00e3o fecha ao redor dela certinho. Mas recomendo tirar duas espumas que vem atr\u00e1s das almofadas do G335 para deixar o som mais ''aberto''.O pl\u00e1stico tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 bem firme e, pelo design simples, n\u00e3o tem um monte de pe\u00e7as pequenas se conectando que podem acabar cedendo que nem o Turtle Beach PX22 que eu tive, que o arco quebrou e n\u00e3o era com o metal fino como do Cloud Stinger nem esse pl\u00e1stico resistente que nem o G335.Se usam \u00f3culos, querem algo leve e confort\u00e1vel, procurem o G335, Cloud Stinger Core ou outros no mesmo estilo.",
