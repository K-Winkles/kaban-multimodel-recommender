                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This Pop Voice lavelier mic came with 3 additional windscreens, a velvet carrying bag, and a 4 pin to 3 pin adapter, and a small user manual. Nothing was missing, and the mic worked as expected out of the box. (Based on how many times in the past I\u2019ve bought items and discovered parts missing upon opening the box, I thought this was a plus.)Upon using the mic, I was actually surprised at how well the Pop Voice works considering it cost less than $10. While the mic doesn\u2019t amplify, it does provide a rather nice, rich sound (when compared to the sound quality of an internal mic on a cellphone). As you can hear from the short test video, there\u2019s a significant difference in sound when standing 10 feet away from the recorder while using the Pop Voice and when not, relying on only the internal mic of a cellphone. The cord is 12.8 feet so it gives you plenty of length to stand/move/walk around allowing you to be farther away from the camera. When playing back the unedited test video through headphones, you\u2019ll hear that the recording is free of hissing and popping. Note: The mic is more sensitive than I thought it would be, and you can hear it picking up a bit of rumbling from the wind during my test video. Using a fuzzy microphone screen would have reduced that noise.The Pop Voice is easy to use - just plug into the headphone jack on your iPhone and start recording. Note: if you have an iPhone 7 or newer, you\u2019ll need to use the 3.5mm to lightning adapter that came with your phone in order to plug it into your phone. What\u2019s great is that it is truly plug and play. There\u2019s no special app to download! It works well with the in camera app that\u2019s standard on all iPhones.Overall I gave the Pop Voice a 5 star rating. Considering what you\u2019re getting and the sound quality when comparing it to other microphones within this same price range, I would say it is definitely worthy of a 5 star.",

                "reviewText": "I got this mic to use with my GoPro Hero 4 Black when recording videos for my YouTube channel. Using the camera's internal mic worked OK, but not great. The internal mic picked up a bit of echo inside my workshop, as well as some hissing in the backdround. Using this external mic cleaned up the sound quite a bit, and lets me focus the mic on my voice or whatever I want to record, which is nice. The mic itself seems like quality hardware, the mic housing and clip are metal, not fragile plastic parts. The cable is nice and long with plenty of extra which allows you to get the mic away from the camera, and move around a bit. I used the included adapter for a standard stereo plug to work with the GoPro mic adapter cable. It's nice knowing the mic will also work with my phone, tablet, PC, or pretty much anything I'd ever want to plug it into... lol The included foam covers are nice too, should make it easier to blend the mic in with different clothing should you want to hide it a little better. Overall I'm happy with the purchase and recommend it! If you'd like to see it in use in one of my recent videos, check this one you YouTube - watch?v=ajlDTImVnCc",

                "reviewText": "I really like this small, yet easy microphone, because it has good sound quality, and it is very simple. It works pretty well with an app my sis and I use called BandLab. My sister and I enjoy making movies, and wanted to extend our movie-making \u201ccareer\u201d with microphones and lighting. I stumbled upon this, and I was very impressed! If there is no background sound, it has a rich, and full sound. It\u2019s definitely not the best lapel mic to use out there, but I think for eleven bucks, it does the trick pretty well. Thanks!",

                "reviewText": "Works well, nice and clear on a laptop computer. Used for singing and recording songs. Came with an adapter, but didn't need it. I plugged it into what the headphones usually plug into, I think it's called a 1.5 mm jack. Then I had to get into the setting and change the jack 1.5mm to microphone instead of headphones. It wasn't to difficult and now it works well. I think I paid 10 bucks for it. It's very small, it's not like a handheld microphone it's just a clip on.",

                "reviewText": "In my initial sound tests everything sounded really, really good! I then set up my laptop to record everything, did a final sound check, and noticed a TERRIBLE buzzing sound in the audio. After a lot of testing (25 different tests so far), I think the problematic audio shows up when the laptop is plugged in, as well as when the laptop fans are spinning above an idle. I tried another microphone to see if maybe my laptop was defective in some way, but it only happened with this lav.Very frustrating, especially because the audio is so good when it's good! But that buzzing sound makes it impossible for me to recommend with any confidence.",
