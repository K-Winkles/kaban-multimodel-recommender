                "reviewText": "The microphone feels very sturdy and well-made, the adjustable is quite flexible while also not giving any issues at all staying in place.As for the audio quality, the Blue Yeti certainly delivers. It captures sound with clarity and depth, making it ideal for capturing vocals and instruments. Additionally, its multiple pickup patterns provide versatility in different recording scenarios, from solo recordings to group interviews. That being said, I did notice some occasional background noise and sensitivity to plosives (popping sounds from \"p\" and \"b\" sounds), which required some post-processing editing.Overall, the Blue Yeti is a solid choice for anyone looking for a high-quality microphone for podcasting or video recording. Its build quality, versatility, and clear audio capture make it a great option, although it may require some additional editing to achieve the perfect sound.",

Sound quality is much better than the Snowball however at \u00a335 for the snowball and nearly \u00a3130 for the Yeti, you would expect the Yeti to be much better. My wife has always wanted one of these and I managed to bag one on a deal for her birthday and she loves it. It looks great on her setup. If you are looking for a great mic through USB and are willing to spend the money go for it",

                "reviewText": "This is a fantastic mic that doesn't have background noise or anything wrong with it. Reviewers saying they have a \"bad one\" or a humming sound are not setting it up properly. If you use the desk stand that comes with then you're going to pick up even the slightest vibration from your computer desk which is what makes the humming noise in the background. That isn't the sign of a bad mic - it shows how great it is because it's picking up even the smallest sound!That's why you see microphones suspended in the air with boom arms in recording studios. Hold the mic in your hand, use a boom arm or put it away from your computer desk and you'll get fantastic sound.You need to spend a short time tweaking settings but it's easy to learn how to get good sound just by searching on YouTube. Once you've spent a few minutes tweaking settings then the sound is fantastic.",
