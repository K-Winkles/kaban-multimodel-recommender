But a big problem for a webcam microphone is that there is no hardware switch to turn off the microphone, and a lot of times if I forgot to mute myself on the software, there may be some embarrassment happening. So that's why I decided to purchase this microphone, mostly for it's hardware mute button to save myself from being worried all the time. And the sound quality is certainly better than I expected given the price range. My friends told me that the sound quality sounds much better with my new microphone. And because it's a separate device, I can conveniently move it around to get the best sound quality. So overall, I am happy with the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "The first thing I noticed when I took this out of the box was how light it was. There's a little ball-swivel thing on the bottom so you can angle the mic how you wish. It's easy to mute yourself and I enjoy the pink color it turns when you are muted. I noticed when recording myself you can hear when you turn the knob, so I'd suggest muting yourself before fiddling with it. From about a foot away, you might sound a bit tinny, but if you move closer to the mic, it's much better quality. I'd suggest using a pop filter with this mic if possible. Overall, it's a good option for those with a lower price range as long as you are aware of its few little nuances. It's quite cute (smaller than my hands) and its visual design is lovely.",

Just an fyi for a really good sound quality for your videos make sure you put the volume all the way up or close to that so you can hear yourself really well. If you have a MacBook make sure you allow the sound of the mic to be on and you can do that by going to settings and going to sound. But all and all definitely worth the money 10/10 :)",

                "reviewText": "This was bought by for my 9 year old son to help complete his gaming setup. He wanted a microphone (because that is what you need apparently) that was simple to setup and use.This one is great! The setup was pretty much plug and play, apart from needing to change to input source then good to go. Did a quick microphone test on windows 11 and came back 100%.For the money he thinks it's perfect. He loves the fact it changes colour and muting it is a one button operation.When it's muted it lights up and stays pink with the light feature switched on. The gain knob is a nice movement and allows for plenty of play depending on what you are doing.He loves it and although his headset has a microphone, he loves using this instead\u2026\u2026.because that\u2019s cool apparently!!There is plenty of movement in the base to allow you to position it just how you want it. The colour changes are subtle and just bright enough.All in all a good purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Construction feels a bit light and plastic and the mount is not isolated so if you place it too close to your computer then it does pick up knocks and bumps through your desk. If you remove the stand and attach it to a microphone arm (you can get them for about \u00a315) then this noise is greatly reduced. It connects via USB and you can plug in a set of headphones to a jack on the mic. There is a suitable amount of RGB for a gaming peripheral and the RGB will indicate the status of the mute function.Sound quality isn't bad. Certainly for gaming, especially with a stand, your voice will come through well with not too much background noise. There isn't any active noise cancellation which is not surprising at this price point.So overall I am giving this 4 stars. The sound is not too bad and it certainly looks the part as well as having the remote volume and mute feature. If you are looking for sound quality particularly then you might want to pay a bit more but otherwise this is worth consideration.",
