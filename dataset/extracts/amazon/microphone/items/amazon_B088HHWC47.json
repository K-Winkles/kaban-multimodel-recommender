The mic itself works beautifully and has great sound for its price point. The only downside (which is also a plus) is the software. Without the Wave Link software, it can be a bit unpredictable at times. The Wave Link software itself works beautifully though, if requiring a bit of finicking to get it working the way you want.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this microphone because my HyperX Quadcast S was starting to act sketchy on my work laptop. Turned out that was actually an issue with my USB-C hub. Anyway, here's the thing: Yes, this microphone sounds pretty good. The headphone jack works REALLY well. I plugged my 250 ohm Beyerdynamic DT880s into it and it powered them loudly and clearly. The dial on the front acts as a headphone volume dial by default - this is awesome! Sound quality is great too. Similar to my Quadcast S honestly lol. Maybe a tiny bit bassier? Whatever.So I started out the next day looking forward to using it with my work computer, running MacOS Big Sur. The mic detected great, everyone heard it just fine. I tap the mute button on top.... and webex picks it up and mutes the output.... wait what?I clicked the unmute button in webex and IT UNMUTED MY MICROPHONE.That's right. ElGato didn't use a HARDWARE MUTE BUTTON here. If you mute your microphone, everything on your computer knows. If you tap the mute button on top of the mic and the light is red, get this: The software can un-mute it at will.That sounds fantastic if you have a meeting host that decides to unmute you for some reason.Fantastic.I'm guessing they did that for better integration with their other products. Unfortunately, there's no way to change the behavior. I really don't like that, and because of that, I'll probably be returning this microphone.To add icing to the cake, the webex muting/unmuting is a little bit unpredictable. Sometimes webex follows the mute button, sometimes it doesn't. Teams worked about as well lol.Ok outside of that. It's a nice mic. The packaging is lovely. It comes with a sweet mic arm attachment adapter. The lights are very clear and again, the sound quality is fantastic. The volume dial is the best I've used. It's a decent amount smaller than my Quadcast S, which is already smaller than a Blue Yeti.If it weren't for that dodgy mute button behavior I'd really love this mic. Hopefully they fix that in a software update someday and give us a choice on how the mute button behaves.",

Before buying this mic I was using a mid range XLR condenser into a Scarlet Solo USB interface, but was having issues with latency when monitoring my voice in real time, which is pretty important in the types of games I'm using this for (Role play servers like Ignite and WildRP etc). The Elgato Wave:3 has a headphone jack for direct monitoring of the mic in your mix and as soon as I plugged it in and made some adjustments it worked perfectly. Sound quality is pretty decent, maybe a 8/10, build quality, also decent, it's body is plastic with some aluminum... but it feels solid. The controls built into the mic are helpful, and the Wave:3 software has worked well! It attached to my boom stand without issue and it's small enough to stay out of the way. I also picked up the Elgato pop filter and shock mount, I've reviewed those separately. Glad I picked this mic up, it's doing exactly what I needed it to do and it sounds good doing it!",
