        "description": "\" Magnetic Mic is the magnetic holder for you microphone. This must-have accessory works with the CB or mobile radio microphone you already have. Magnetic Mic will install with ease in just a few minutes. Magnetic Mic enhances safety by reducing distracted driving. This easy-to-use conversion kit helps drivers stay focused on the road when picking up and returning a CB or police radio microphone to its holder. Magnetic Mic\u2019s microphone adapter is precisely engineered and expertly machined. This slotted metal disc easily fits over and securely locks onto the back of your existing microphone. The magnetic base replaces the conventional metal hang-up mic clip used with most radio microphones. With its sleek unibody construction, there are no sharp edges for the user to worry about. Constructed from aerospace grade materials, Magnetic Mic is incredibly durable and ready for years of use. The magnetic base can be installed anywhere within reach, and not necessarily in sight. Magnetic Mic\u2019s ease-of-use allows you to mount your radio mic holder in locations traditionally considered less-than-optimal, like the passenger side of a center console. When you\u2019re finished with the microphone, simply get it close to the base, and let it go. The magnetic mic holder quickly guides your microphone into place. There\u2019s no need to take your eyes off the road to hunt for and fumble with a conventional hang-up clip. Picking up your microphone is just as easy. Magnetic Mic works with virtually all radio systems. It doesn\u2019t matter if your radio system functions with an on-hook/off- hook setting, switches to a private line or scans when hung up, Magnetic Mic is ready-for-use with your radio system. Spanning a wide range of industries, more than 255,000 radio operators stay focused in their industries by using Magnetic Mic.\"",

We have them on our Code 3, Whelen and Motorola products. Previously members have pulled mics down by the cords trying to get them back into their holder which has damaged a few mics but with this they're able to place the mic near the pad and it automatically falls into place. Would absolutely recommend this to anyone in emergency services or even anyone with a UHF. Absolutely fantastic product 10/10 worth every cent.",
