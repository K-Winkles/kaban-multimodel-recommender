                "reviewText": "I'll start by saying this item was purchased weeks before christmas. It was shipped via prime and didn't arrive until days after Christmas.I purchased this for my 4 year old son as he LOVES to sing and hear himself lol. The product however is so cheaply made i mean it literally falls apart in your hand. The top part that you speak into screws onto the speaker part and the handle also screws into the speaker. It doesn't screw on flush and secure. The rechargeable battery literally sticks out of the bottom. If you push it up then the handle is no longer secure to the speaker part. Its constantly moving as you hold it. The battery moves out of place so the thing is always turning on and off. Every time you turn it on you have to hear \" BLUETOOTH DEVICE IS READY TO PAIR\" in a Chinese accent so thick I could barely make out what it was saying the first time I heard it. Lastly, the battery on this thing lasts like 10 minutes at full charge. It spends more time plugged up than it spends being used which is very frustrating for my 4 year old as he starts playing with it and 10 minutes later after repeated turning on and off from the battery moving then boom its dead and needs recharging. DO NOT BUY. Purchase a higher quality one because this one isn't it. Belongs in the dollar store...or the trash",

This was cheaper than the prop ones that don\u2019t echo or anything so I figured why not. However, the top isn\u2019t fully attached, and easily comes undone. The instructions aren\u2019t entirely clear..doesn\u2019t give you any real direction on how to use all the features. The sound is a bit wonky, you need to put your mouth directly on the microphone to even hear yourself.The Bluetooth feature is very cool though, you can pick a song from Apple Music, YouTube, etc and it will play though the mic. But overall not overly impressed",
