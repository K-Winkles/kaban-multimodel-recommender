Is it possible to connect this to a karaoke speaker? Yes, If your karaoke speaker has a 6.35mm or 3.5mm input interface, you can easily connect the receiver to it. Does the receiver need batteries? Batteries are not included in the product and require a separate purchase, the receiver requires 2AA batteries, each microphone requires 2AA batteries, and a total requires 6AA batteries. Is it normal to encounter intermittent cut-outs during use? Although we designed the WM760 with environmental interference in mind, some interference is unavoidable. At this point, you can adjust the frequency of the microphone, which can minimize the interference during your use.",

                "reviewText": "I sold it to a client. But the mic starts to make scratching noises at 30 to 40 feet distance. You need to stand at 10 feet to be sure. The transmitter has 3 leds, the one in the middle, when blicks, is because there is a signal problem. I was using them for the first time and the middle light was blicking, I changed batteries, and still. I was already in a corporate presentation so... this is all we had. It ran well for the five minutes the person spoke, but I was lucky.The bad problem is that when is losing signal you hear a very loud noise in the speakers, that is a no no!So... I would suggest to skip this product. It sounds good when it works but I was not able to solve the blinking light problem.",

My husband is the lead singer in a cover band in Vegas and there is no way he could use this mic instead of the equipment he has, but as far as MC and small gathering microphones, it is better than most. I certainly like the way the children sound on these mics a lot more than the old ones they were using!",
