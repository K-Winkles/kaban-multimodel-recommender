At first I thought it might not have enough juice so I ended up not completing my video and when I got home, I charged the microphone. I went to use the microphone again and it worked for a minute or so and then I couldn't hear anything again. I haven't used them since because I don't trust them. But when it was working, it had excellent quality with clarity.",
