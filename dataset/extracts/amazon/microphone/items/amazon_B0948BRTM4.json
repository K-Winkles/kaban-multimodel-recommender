Another selling point for me, is I have a deep voice and I have not found a mic that would pick my voice up worth a crap until this one. That being said I haven't tried high end mics, just ones around this price range, and headset mics. The downside is the software. There is no mixing/effects software from roccat. It just allows you to kind of change the colors.",

                "reviewText": "This is a good quality, good sounding mic which has a heavy duty construction. The mic can be rotated while it sits in the base which is nice. Volume and gain control is important for a good set up. The colors are nice to touch. It is comparable in sound and quality to the hyperx quad I had and more versatile than the hyperx solo. The difference being that the quad and solo are best arm mounted. The solo has small foot print so i keep it on the arm and this one is the better desk mount option.",

                "reviewText": "Great mic! Only using this when gaming online with my friends, because I don't like to always have to use a headset to chat. Previously used a Blu Snowball.Have this mounted on a cheapo $15 mic arm I also got from AMZ. Roccat includes the short USB C to USB C cable if you want to use this on the control board and also a longer USB C cable if you want to use it on an arm.Sound quality is good, I would say pretty much on par with the Snowball. Main reason for the switch was to have the easily accessible controls on hand. Controls include a switch that controls the power and pickup pattern, mic volume control with a push to mute, and an onboard gain level. It also has a gimmicky yet useful quick mute on the top of the condenser which if it detects motion above it it will mute/unmute the mic, which has a switch on the back of the control board that allows you to set the sensitivity level of the motion that triggers it. Also on the rear of the control board is the RGB switch, and a 3.5mm headphone jack used for mic monitoring.Another cool thing about the control board is it notifies you if the mic is live by showing you a lit up LIVE led on the front of the board. If the mic is muted it shows a red led mic off light. The mic itself also color codes the pickup mode.One thing to note, when you initially install the mic to the PC it may not be detected if you have the audio pick up setting to the default option. Switching it to carboid, stereo, or whisper mode may solve that issue.Overall a great mic!",

                "reviewText": "I had picked this up for around 45-46$ used. It didnt have the original box, but it came with everything it needed. All of the cables and of course the microphone itself.for 99$ I am aware this condenser mic is a steal, but used in fantastic quality, this is probably the best boom mic you can buy as of this review. I've yet to mount it onto an arm and once I do, it'll further prove itself as one of the greatest budget boom mics you can ever own.",
