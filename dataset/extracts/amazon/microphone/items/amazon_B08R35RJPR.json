                "reviewText": "I got it on sale for 20 bucks. An impulse buy that I regretted before I even got it, after reading many negative reviews post purchase. It's a bit flimsy like the reviews said, but I don't regret buying it, after receiving it. It is very portable and very adjustable. Good for miking amps or snare drums. It's not suitable for large studio vocal mic imo It's too light for that. But a stage mic, a small diaphragm condenser, or an sm57 It's fine if you adjust it properly. You can put a large condenser on there but I wouldn't bend thr gooseneck at all with a big heavy mic on there, it's really too light for those larger mics imo. I think it's meant to be very portable very adjustable and have small storage and travel footprint. And it is good for that It is a bit flimsy, as the previous reviewers stated, and a pro will probably need better quality. I don't see it lasting more than 3 months in a pro studio where they are setting up and tearing down all the time. but a pro knows that and will be paying much more for that pro grade durability to hold up in a working studio over the long haul. But for me and most with a small home studio recording their band or whatever, I bet it lasts for many many years. Overall, for 20 dollars, this stand is very usable and a great value for the avg person making recordings out there. I don't regret buying it after all.",

                "reviewText": "DO NOT BUY THIS AS A MICROPHONE STAND !!! So why did I give it four stars instead of one? I bought this to hold my Eurorack synthesizer cables using a gizmo from Amazon that screws on a microphone stand (with my bad back, the lighter\u2014the better is my mantra). I would never ever trust this to hold a microphone that weighs more than a couple of ounces or costs more than two beers. If weight is a major issue (such as you often need to schlep all your gear from your parked vehicle to a club down the street, and then maybe up a flight of stairs\u2014been there and done that!) then just be very careful not to bump into it\u2014it will likely tip over easily if bumped into and YOU MIGHT BE VERY SORRY YOU TRUSTED THIS STAND WITH A SERIOUS MICROPHONE. I would not extend the collapsible tubes more than half-way. It will likely be wobbly with any significant mass bearing down. But if You\u2019re just needing a light, utility stand to hold patch cables or guitar picks, a clipped-on set list, a cup holder or a light/cheap $10 karaoke mic, then this might be the stand for you. Just be clear on what you will be using this for !!",

I wanted a stand that folded up smaller than a traditional mic stand, had a tripod base, and a goose neck instead of a boom. This stand has all those things. I often play in tight spots and the tripod base fits in those spots much better than the usual legs that are not adjustable and often too long on other stands. Boom sections are also a pain, sticking out and being in the way so the goose neck eliminates that problem. Also having three tiers instead of two means the stand folds up very short so it fits in my hardware bag. (Note that to use the included carry bag the stand needs to be fully disassembled instead of just set to its shortest length).The stand is also very light and comes with 2 different clips!Not sure about the durability over time. It has plastic fittings that could break so I'm not sure this stand would survive heavy touring but for gigs around town I think it will be ok. So far it has been great.",
