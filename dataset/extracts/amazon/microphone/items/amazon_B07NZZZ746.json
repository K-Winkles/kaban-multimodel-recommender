I'm like say that again, huh, what was that?I saw this on a few reviews, and it looked cool, didn't need a interface or full get up to get it going. Plugged it in, and she was so much more crisp and clear in discord.Setup was easy, not much to do really. We have several cats, and they haven't knocked the mic over once on its standard stand it comes with, its very sturdy. The red color is nice, and the mute button on it works fine for us, although others have said it was a issue.Great purchase, and working as intended. No packaging or setup issues.",

                "reviewText": "A huge upgrade from any product from Blue, whether it be the Yeti or Snowball, HyperX has proven that they can hang with the big boys of USB microphones. This microphone has all the features you could need for a midrange or even high end setup. It features 4 different audio capture options, including cardioid, stereo, mono, and bi-directional, the lattermost being great for podcasting/1 on 1 interviews. The stand is made out of metal and very stable, so this microphone isn't going to fall over at any point. Very easy to mute and unmute by simply tapping the top like you would any touchscreen, and the red LEDs giving a clear indication that it is unmuted.The sound quality itself is exceptional, very clear and doesn't produce very much USB noise. The microphone has some noise cancellation through the foam in the main chassis, but an additional pop filter is recommended for more noise reduction. It's also very easy to adjust the gain with the slider on the bottom to control the volume of your voice. The microphone also has a line out audio jack that is great for monitoring, and even works well as an external sound card for a laptop or other device in a pinch. No software is needed to get the most out of this microphone, which is very welcome.This is overall one of the best microphones you can get around the $100 range that is from a reputable brand, and has given me no issues and only worked exactly as needed for well over 2 years now. Recommended to anyone looking to do light to heavy amounts of gaming or content creation.",

The feedback that I have gotten from my gaming buddies is that there is a huge audio difference when I use the HyperX vs when I use a headset. Overall if you are looking for a good quaility mic, this is for sure worth you time!",

Mine is, so muffled people can hardly me like if I whispered (at max sound volume!).Not too bulky or heavy. I would not pick another MC instead, this one is at such a good price at 99$. Love its design! The red string on its sides is actual material though, it's not plastic or metal. The mute button tap on the top is so comfy and efficient.I really wish I could remove the red LED lighting using the HyperX app (which I use for my RGB keyboard) but the app doesn't even detect this MIC. Would have needed the upper model (\"S\" i think) that has full RGB but not worth the price difference for me.",

                "reviewTitle": "Solid construction and performance for the price point",
                "reviewText": "I've always loved HyperX products, I have a 7 year old Hyperx Cloud II headset that's still going strong even though the leather is starting to flake off. HyperX construction always feels premium with the brushed metal, soft leather, accent stitched thread, etc and their microphone line follows that same trend. The Quadcast is much bigger and heavier than I expected it to be based on the listing photos. It feels sturdy in the hands. Nothing feels cheap, not even the soft coated plastic parts. It looks sleek, even for a gaming mic. I don't care for the black and red or RGB aesthetic, but HyperX does a good job of toning it down while still making it marketable to that specific crowd. I bought a pop filter that blocks out 90% of the red LED which unfortunately can't be turned off, although it serves the purpose of letting you know that the mic is on and active so it's not all bad. I would recommend a pop filter, although the Quadcast has one built in, it was still picking up some pops from about 7-8 inches from my mouth. Pop filter eliminates it entirely. I also bought a boom arm, the Quadcast's shock stand wasn't able to filter out impact noise from my wood desk, could just be the size and density of my desk and not specifically the stand's fault, but again the boom arm eliminates that issue entirely.As far as performance, I was upgrading from my Hyperx Cloud II mic which has always been subpar so it was a significant difference, all of my friends mentioned it within seconds of hearing me talk on the Quadcast, saying I sounded really clear, like I was \"in their head\", or like I was on a podcast. This was with no finetuning, now I use the SteelSeries Sonar program for the ClearCast AI noise cancelling, it filters out my keyboard taps and background noise better than Discord's Krispy and also carries over into in-game recordings, Krispy obviously cannot. Also love the mute function. Gentle tap on the end of the mic works every time, super responsive.It's a great mic, I don't think you'll find anything better for the price, this is it. I've already gotten some of my friends to buy it because they were so blown away by how much better and clearer I sound. If you've been considering making the switch from a headset mic, I'd say look no further. You will not be disappointed with this mic.",
