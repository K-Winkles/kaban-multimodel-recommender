                "reviewText": "I recently found a copy of Hey You Pikachu and its VRU unit at a used gaming store. It was my absolute favorite game in my teen years, so I immediately picked it up. The only problem is, the VRU was missing its microphone. The store owner told me that any mono microphone would work with the unit. I decided to try this mic out after considering my other options. To my surprise, it works fantastically with the VRU and I have been having a great time reliving my youth. As a bonus, since the mic fits over the head, it actually is a lot more convenient than its OEM counterpart!So for those out there who are looking for a replacement mic for the N64 VRU's for whatever reason, this is a great choice!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this so I could use it with my PC while gaming. I can find good-sounding headphones easy, but finding some with a microphone attached is more difficult. Also more uncomfortable. This solves that. The band is lightweight, the microphone arm is VERY adjustable - it's one of those segmented metal tube deals that can bend and hold in nearly any shape - so I can place it where I want, and the sound quality is just dandy, at least according to the people I use to talk to it. A definite improvement in my normal setup.Now that said, this isn't perfect for PC use. There are a few limitations that mean you need to get some extra hardware to make it work for you. In particular: - The cable is very short, maybe 3-4 feet, so you'll probably need an extension cable unless you keep your head 3-4 feet away from your gaming rig. - The plug is mono, not stereo. Many modern gaming PCs (mine included) expect a stereo input and will wind up dumping all the audio to the left channel instead of both. Then as a bonus, a number of applications (like Discord) listen only to the RIGHT channel, so people won't just hear you out of one ear, they won't hear you at all. Maddening.Fortunately both of those problems can be fixed with a few low-cost purchases. One 3.5mm mono female to stereo male adapter, one 3.5mm mono extension cable and you're in business. With that in hand this becomes a perfect addition for any PC user who wants a decent microphone. I wholeheartedly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I've tried a couple of different microphones to use as a replacement to the original. This is the best of the bunch. Not only is it a fraction of the cost, but it is superior in quality. I have no problems with feedback or clicking due to weak wires. The wire on this microphone is fabric wrapped, and I feel that it will last longer than the others I've tried. Other microphones I've tried have lasted for 6 months to a year, which is decent for the prices I've paid. I'm guessing the Huacam mike may last even longer although it is WAY cheaper than the others. Since it's 2 mikes at about 1/3 the price of one of the other mikes I've purchased, I've decided to stock up and get two two-packs (four mikes) to have on hand. The Huacam mike seems surprisingly high quality. So pleased with purchase.Here's a link to the voice amp I use with this mike (which I'm VERY pleased with btw): VoiceBooster Voice Amplifier & Mp3 Player 16watts Black MR2200 (Aker) by TK Products,Portable, for Teachers, Coaches, Tour Guides, Presentations, Costumes, Etc. The only advantage the other mikes have over the Huacam is that they are lower profile and lightweight. These are the other more expensive, low-profile (yet all have issues with feedback and clicking).
