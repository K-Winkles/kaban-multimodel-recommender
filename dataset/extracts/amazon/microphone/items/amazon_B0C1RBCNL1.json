I finally decided to upgrade my microphone for my online meetings, but I was focused on ease of use instead of sound quality. Thankfully, this is the best of both worlds. It's so user friendly that all I have to do is plug it into the USB port on the side of my chrome book and it's ready to go. The sound is great and it comes with some extras. The set includes a tripod that is very sturdy and can be moved in all directions. It also comes with a pop filter that is removable if you want and the microphone itself lights up and changes colors.",

                "reviewText": "I've never used a mic before but to me this one seems very professional. It has a mic screen to stop sound popping and I also really like the rubberband design that allows you to swivel the mic to a different angle. It also comes with an RGB strip but I'm not sure what's the purpose for its inclusion.",
