I like that I can detach it and swap for a longer one, if need be. The on/off switch is made of chintzy plastic and has a bit of play to it - if anything ever breaks, it'll be the switch...but regardless, the mic on the whole feels very sturdy so may not ever be an issue.In my opinion, it sounds good enough to use for professional needs, like DJ and MC, possibly podcasting with the right mixer and sound engineer. The pickups are excellent, even from the sides (though they are noticeably quieter than speaking directly into the top of the mic) and do a good job filtering out background noise.10/10, would mic again.",

                "reviewText": "My karaoke machine is not top-of-the-line, but it isn't a child's piece of junk either. The microphone that came with it just stopped working one day, so I ordered this one. The cord is REALLY long -- didn't measure it, but I'm guessing maybe 20 feet. It's so long that if you stretched it all the way out you could not see the words of the song on the screen. But that's a minor issue. The real issue is the sound quality, which, for me, was awful. Again, it may be a problem with my machine, although I did not have that problem previously, and do not have that problem now with the wireless microphone I bought to replace this one. I'm not saying it's a bad product, just that it did not work well for me.",
