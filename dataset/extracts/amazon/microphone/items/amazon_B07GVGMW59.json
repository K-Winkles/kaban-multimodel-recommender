            "Omnidirectional Microphone - It is not a Speaker or Speakerphone, it is a condenser microphone. The microphone has an omnidirectional pickup pattern with a pickup distance of 11.5 ft, making it easy to capture the most subtle sounds from 360\u00b0 directions and transmit the sound more loud and clear. Participants can hear each other without raising their voices.",
            "Made for Conferences - This microphone is perfect for small or medium meetings over an internet network by using Skype/GoToMeeting/WebEx/Hangouts/Fuze/VoIP/Zoom and other softwares. You can also use it for court reports, seminars, remote training, business negotiations, video chats, etc.",
            "Plug & Play, No Drivers Required - The microphone is compatible with all operating systems - both Windows and macOS. You just need to plug the microphone to start recording. If there is no response after inserting the mic, please go to the microphone setting of your computer and select the mic as the INPUT device.",
            "Convenient Mute Button - Quickly mute/unmute your microphone. The built-in blue indicator light for checking whether the USB microphone is working.",
            "Well Designed Cable, Durable - The microphone is constructed of sturdy and durable metal material and the base is fitted with an anti-slip mat which keeps it stable on desktop during use. It is small, convenient and does not require much space when in use. Connected with a 1.8m nylon shielded wire, it effectively eliminates signal interferences to achieve the best recording results."

                "reviewText": "So for whatever reason, the microphone in my laptop stopped working well. Everyone one video calls would complain that I sounded quiet and far away, or that they couldn't hear me at all even though I was unmuted and everything. This happened on Facebook, Google Meets/Hangouts, Zoom, didn't matter what platform it was. It drove me CRAZY, so I started using earbuds with an external microphone, but that's no good for when my partner and I want to call someone together. Enter, this external mic.I now use it even when I'm on a video call alone because the sound quality is better than the inline mic on my earbuds. It's wonderful to just be able to talk normally, not shout or struggle or have to type out what I want to say because no one can hear me. I don't mean to be melodramatic, but this item has improved my quality of life since the pandemic. Video calls suck, but they suck a lot less when people can actually hear you. I don't get complaints about my sound quality or volume anymore and I can just speak naturally on video calls. This works with my Dell computer that runs Windows 10 as simple plug-and-play, as advertised. I didn't have to download anything or do any setup at all, just push the button on the device so that it glows blue and if necessary make sure the video platform has the device selected as audio input. I'd highly recommend this as an easy to use and good quality solution for video calls, especially if you have one or more people sitting with you in the room and you want everyone to be heard clearly. We haven't really tested the limits of the range, but it works great if my partner and I are sitting around the kitchen table or on the couch together; the people on the other end can hear both of us just fine. This is quite possibly the best $40 I've spent this year.",

                "reviewText": "All my laptops have had built in cameras and microphones, but several of them have only been able to pick up sound directly in-front of the screen. That seems good, but sometimes my wife and I want to have teleconferences together, and just being off to one side would make it so we couldn't be heard. This is great at being a conference mic. Multiple people can sit around a table, talk normally, and still be heard. I have even gotten up and walked across the room to get stuff, and I can still be heard as long as I raise my voice a little. None of my laptop microphones ever allowed that.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this in May 2020 once it was evident I would be working from home for an extended period. I'm on conference calls or video conferences almost all day long and needed a good quality mic that would also block out background noise since I don't work in an enclosed room where I can close the door. I read a review where someone indicated they were looking at purchasing commercial grade conference call equipment for an office environment for a substantial and decided to try these instead since there was a considerable cost savings. It worked out so well, these mics became their permanent solution. That sold me so I tried one and it delivered on every aspect. The quality is fantastic and the best part is I can literally be inches away or 10 feet away and picks up my voice clearly yet filters all the background noise. I can talk in a normal voice as if everyone else is in the room with me and yet it does not pick up the clicking of my typing unless it's right next to the keyboard. After using it daily for almost 2 years now, I would highly recommend this microphone.",

Unfortunately I wasn't able to make the 4 hour drive to make it that weekend but I was able to send it with someone else the following weekend. The thing is, I'm the \"tech guy\" for the group. The fear that came over the face of the one who turns everything on when I told them I needed their help to set up the mic, well, I couldn't help but laugh. I got it with a usb extension cable so that it could be moved closer to the group seating. I talked them through plugiing the mic into the extension and then switching it out with the other mic. Zoom doesn't automatically stwich microphones, so I talked them through that and turning it up in the in the Zoom settings. Bingo, it was the clearest they have been since I first them up. On one computer and camera so we could see everyone at once. Simple and easy.",

Only problem is that even when my macbook is in sleep mode and I press the power button on the mic, it will randomly turn on again after 5-10 minutes with its annoyingly bright blue light. I have no idea why or how thats even possible but its very noticeable at night when Im trying to sleep. Unplugging it is way too much of a hassle with my setup, otherwise its a good mic.",
