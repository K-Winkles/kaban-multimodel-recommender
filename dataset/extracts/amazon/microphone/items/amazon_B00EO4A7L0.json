                "reviewText": "The Rode SmartLav+ is a wearable microphone also known as a Lavalier mic it is a Broadcast Quality Professional Grade Lavalier Mic or at least that\u2019s what it\u201ds called, it comes with a TRRS jack which is compatible with most smartphones and the reason behind that is because the smartlav+ is mainly made for usage which motivated RODE to make an app for all the iOS users out there to benefit the most from its feautures, however if you are planning on pluging it to your DSLR or your camera don\u2019t get your hopes too high since your camera needs a TRS jack while the SmartLav+ offers a TRRS one ! but on the other hand RODE did find a way around it by making the RODE SC3 Adapter a TRRS to TRS adapter so you can plug this directly to your camera that will cost you 15$ !+ Now lets talk about the mic itself ! It comes in a omnidirectional condeser mic capsule and inside of it is the discrete 4.5mm miniature microphone, the cable is a 116cm Kevlar reinforced cable so don\u2019t worry about the microphone stretching or snaping in normal usage but I would recommand the Rode SC1 TRRS Extansion cable for an extra 580cm !+The package also includes a foam windshield which feels pretty premium and will help you avoid all the t,b and p harsh sounds and will reduce the breathing noise it also comes together with a durable mounting clip so you can attach to your shirt ! Or anything you want and a cool locking letherate bag to take it with you if you are on the GO+ Now I'll talk about some problems, first of all and the most annoying thing, is that whenever I plug it to my PC or even DSLR, the Clip keeps tazing me whenever it contacts my skin, which makes it harder on me ta concetrate on the content I am creating, 2nd things, is the cable, I beleive that it is tooo short for a lavalier mic, but what I did, is plug the smartLav+ to my smartphone and then put it back into my pocket ( which doesn't taze me lol) and then recor on both the msartphone and DSLR, and then later on I sync it in Premiere Pro, which makes it a lot easier and efficientto work with but those are not some serioues problems, and most of them can be fixed by using some commen senseSo overall the microphone does an amazing job for it\u2019s 79$ pricetag, and if I had to choose between this or even the seneheiser ME-2 which costs 70$ more I would easily pick this all day long so if you are considering buying both the SC3 and the SC1 Adapter then this whole setup will cost you around 120$ which is a nobrainer for the quality you are getting from this kit \ud83d\ude0a",

It's small, so there is no adjustment for the NC amount. It's a simple device: a thin cable with a mic on one end and plug on the other end. Only issue is the Mac regards it as a full headset, not just a mic. So I need to disconnect the mic to hear any sound. When it's plugged in, system settings will not let me choose any other device for sound output. That means this mic is not for video conferencing.",

Not wanting to spend the money on a full setup with a transmitter, I looked into a few of the cheaper options, but none of them worked out.Then I saw this from Rode, a reliable audio company that specializes in stuff like this. As a matter of fact, I currently have a Rode USB microphone and am very familiar with their products.The price is worth it. The alternative is getting a full setup, which would run $150-$200, on the low end. There is a reason the others like is run $15-$30... because they do not work. This lav mic from Rode does, and it is not far off from sounding like a full unit.It is pretty simple, actually. It isolates the vocal while reducing background noise. Wearing it next to loud fans and equipment is not a problem for this little guy, and I have not needed to do any heavy editing to make it sound right. It simply gets the job done.Well done, Rode!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Great Lavalier Microphone, But Only for Smart Devices",
                "reviewText": "I just purchased these for recording audio for live event video production. I record audio separate from my video and sync in post.Pros:The sound quality of the lav+ is great. The microphone is very responsive to the human voice frequency and overtones. Great dynamic range. This works perfect with the iphone 5s and android tablets and iPod touch. Great for dictation or a cheaper interview type audio recording situation.Seamless upload. After you record your audio you can send it to dropbox or sound cloud easily inside the Rode Rec App.Custom Audio settings. The Rode Rec App offers the user a plethora of settings to record quality audio for any application. You can set sampling rate (from11k up to 96k 24 bit), audio format (Mp3, Wav, WMA, ACC, etc), compression, limiting, gain, etc. The app really lets you dial it in.The App. The Rode Rec App is great. You can start recording on your smart device and turn off the screen so your subject doesn't accidentally hit \"stop\".Recommendations: For live event videogrpahy, I recommend using the smartlav+ with a iPod touch, or similar device, I do not recommend using a smart phone because if the phone is not switch to \"airplane\" mode or do not disturb, a incoming call will casue the app to pause the recording.Cons:iPod nano: you can not use the Rode app on a iPod nano. This would have been a great solution for recording multiple subjects at live events, but this is a apple issue that Rode should consider approaching apple about as it would benefit both.No extra windscreens: The smartlav+ only comes with one windscreen and I can't find extras anywhere online. So if you, or the person you place this mic on looses the windscreen, it's gone for good. So, I am disappointment rode doesn't offer windscreens separately.Smart devices only: The trrs connector. Because the connection is trrs as opposed to standard trs, the smartlav+ only works on smart devices. A majority of my business is weddings and I don't want to place my iphone on a groom, officiant, or bride to record audio. If they break it or loose it, its on me and I don't want to hand my clients a expensive device with all my contacts and other private information on it. I also can't trust their device because, they may turn it off, hit stop recording and not start again, or they could not switch to airplane mode and get a text, email, or phone call in the middle of the event and create a dead spot in the audio. Being strictly a smart device mic seems to have more draw backs than positives.Works with \"dumb\" devices, but you need a adapter. Rode does make a adapter, the rode SC3, but it's $15 per adapter and the plug is a 90 degree elbow which may be \"ok\" for the zoom h1, but it's not ideal for other digital recorders with top mounted inputs where a elbow plug is more likely snag something and disconnect or cause interference.I like this product, but it's hard to find a field recorder it is compatible with aside from smart devices. I am disappointed it doesn't play well with others.Conclusion: The sound quality is great. Rode constructed a great lavalier microphone. I wish it was easier to use with standard audio recorders. But, it performs exactly as Rode advertises. It is a great product. I wonder why Rode doesn't offer a alternative field recorder that would be a little easier for live event videographers on a budget, because I still worry someone will want to steal my smart device. If Rode did make a feild record strictly for the smartLav+, they would literally have the entire market to themselves.I do recommend this product because honestly there is nothing else out their in this price range and quality to compare it to.But, I also recommend using it with a iPod touch or similar device.",

Las \u00fanicas 2 cuestiones es que: 1.- Son TRRS y para ciertos dispositivos hay que adquirir adaptadores y 2.- El cable es un poco corto. Para conectarse a un transmisor inal\u00e1mbrico est\u00e1 perfecto, pero si eres de los que prefieren evitar interferencias y tener todo con cable, hay que adquirir extensiones de cable.A\u00fan as\u00ed son 100% recomendables.",
