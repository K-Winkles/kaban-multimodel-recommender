You need an external mic to sound really good and THIS one blew me away. I have a career in professional broadcasting and cannot stand poor audio quality and looked long & hard for an external mic to try hooking up to my iPhone. This is as good as it gets at this price point, you will love it. And it feels solid, it is metal, not cheapo plastic. Yes the little plastic tripod is annoying and you will do much better with an actual mic stand, as this tripod tips over easily. But you're buying a good mic, not a stand, so don't let that stop you from getting this truly impressive mic. Poscasters, this will be good for you too. Yes it is pricey but you know how it is, you have to pay for quality.",

Absolutely amazing for my voice-overs. The Rode Central software is super easy and plun n' go. I'm not a big fan of the aural and big bottom exciters, but the compressor and high pass filter are top-notch. They work at the same time I'm recording using Audacity which is a huge plus.All metal designmade in Australia (yes, not China)24bit 48khz sample rate recording (you don't need more than that)driverless (as far as I am aware)USB C cable is firm and heavyPop filter get's the job donestand is nicelights up a blue LED on the side that records sound (looks nice)super low noise and high gain (pretty impressive for USB actually)Mid-range is the sweetest I have ever heard for a mic (perfect for voice)I have no complaints. My mic came in damage free, so I am not sure what happened to the other reviewers mics. Not fair to give it 1 star, though. This mic screams quality outside in. The fact that Rode makes this mic in Australia tells me that they are really proud of it, and I can see why. Well worth the cost, as it's a weird mic that is super beginner friendly (it's plug and forget USB) and 'End-Game' (the quality is that impressive IMHO).",

I don't leave reviews often but this mic is worth every penny. It was $99 when I bought it in 2020 and it's still $99. Can't imagine that there's a better value mic out there.",

                "reviewText": "Overall this a great little mic if you need some small for voice.Pros:Small sizeHigh quality nylon and aluminum constructionSimple magnetic baseStrong headphone amplifier built in, able to drive many headphones, including those with higher impedance like the MDR V6 at 53ohmsCompact and portableSolid USB C connection with a quality, adequate length included cableCons:Limited to 96khz. People debate this, but 192khz does often sound a bit better to me, though it's not necessary.Somewhat high noise floor - the mic can sound a bit sizzlyIncluded stand is very low, and easily picks up background noise. Depending on your use case you'll almost definitely need to pick up a separate stand that brings the mic within 6 inches of your mouth to take advantage of the proximity effect. You can get an aftermarket stand for not too much money, but frankly I'm not sure why they included such a short stand.Depending on your voice timbre, it can sound somewhat flat and 'robotlike'. This is more a personal problem for since I have a very monotone voice. Different mics can make it sound better.Overall, for the money you really can't go wrong. It's far better than any included headset mic, the headphone amp is very good, and it also sounds pretty decent for acoustic guitar.",

The sound processing options that come with the app you get on the website give you good tools for further tuning the filtering and way that your voice comes across.The build quality seems very nice as well, even the legs do not feel shoddy and the unit looks sleek. I do wish I could turn off the blue status light as it is mildly distracting!One thing to note - you need to have a USB C port on your computer for this to work right, if you try a C to A cable it will stop working after a second of recording for some strange reason.",

It was endless and I was never satisfied with the results.Then Rode comes out with this microphone that allows to save DSP settings and use your own audio mixer solution and I was intrigued. Bit the bullet bought the microphone and I'm extremely content with the results.Using Rode Central , I set the desired settings and just go! Plug, play , forget about it. No more tweaking, great extremely crisp sound and an amazing noise gate that finally removes the extra noise in my environment that other filters and plugins within OBS failed to do and not tax my CPU like crazy.Will always recommend Rode to anyone I speak to. Just in love with the microphone and how great it sounds and no more tweaking!I'm already invested in a BEACN Mix Create for my audio mixing solution, but love the idea I can access Unify as a backup if ever my Mix Unit dies.Highly recommend this microphone if you're in store for a new one.",
