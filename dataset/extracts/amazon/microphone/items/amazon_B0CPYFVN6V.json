                "reviewText": "I got this because I am in a business where I go live on Facebook quite a lot. I liked this particular set because it has two mics so if a second person joins me in the kitchen we can both have good sound.The sound using this Bluetooth mic is super clear, I don\u2019t have to worry about if I walk away from my camera a little or move around the kitchen (I make cooking videos) that my viewers won\u2019t be able to hear me. What\u2019s cool is it picks up my sound, but things like my kids in another room or the tv doesn\u2019t get picked up, making it a much cleaner and clearer sound for my followers.The mic clips easily on a kind of shirt and picks up a lot, in a good way. I like its plug and play basically. I just put the adaptor into my charger port on my phone and turn on the mic and it\u2019s ready to go. (As long as Bluetooth is on )I use this several times a week with no issues with cutting out or sound issues and my viewers can hear me better and appreciate that greatly. It\u2019s easy to charge and the battery life lasts quite a while, so that\u2019s nice as well. So far, after many uses, the mic clip has held up well (some can be cheaply made, this isn\u2019t one of them) and I\u2019m overall happy with sound quality and ease of use.",

Finding ones for Apple were not as easy as I thought it would be, but this pair works almost perfectly. Her only issue was that she found it difficult to connect to both the mics and hear headset simultaneously. She ended up figuring it out, but it was a little challenging to get both running at the same time. I don't know if this was an issue with the mics, with the headphones, or with her model phone, so I'm not taking any stars off for it from the mics. But, I did want to mention it. Otherwise the sound is great, the bluetooth distance is good, and the battery length is sufficient for her projects! We're calling this a very good value!",

If you are using this on a camera from a distance of 5 feet or less then you won\u2019t be able to tell any difference. It\u2019s more effective further away.
