                "reviewText": "I don't have great pictures because these were mounted discretely under a board room table that was being converted into a new Microsoft Teams conference room. These mic's are daisy chained under the table connected to a docking station via USB that connects to a laptop. They pick up whispers in each corner of the room and provide a very clear sound through the teams calls. These daisy chain through an aux connection then the starting pod connects through USB to the laptop / device. easy to set up, although initially i thought i could split off from the start pod as a 'left pod' and 'right pod' then chain off of one of those, they don't work this way, it seems to be one pod -> one pod -> one pod -> one pod (rather than one pod <- base pod -> one pod -> one pod). It turned out ok, just required more testing before hand.the underside of the mic pods have a rubber like texture, i did use double sided tape (30lb outdoor type), and it does work and so far, a few weeks in still holding up just fine.strongly recommend for anyone building a conference room and doesn't want to use the expensive huddle room packages offered by other companies. Plus... no batteries to worry about charging / dying.",

We used them for a Zoom meeting with about 15 people sitting around tables with about 15 to 18 feet between them and the sound was picked up just fine and was clear to the people on the other end. I would recommend these. I didn't rate them five stars mainly because they are so small and light, it is easy for them to get moved and knocked around.",

                "reviewText": "These little microphones were just what I wanted--I was looking for unobtrusive mics to place around a conference room during a hybrid meeting (some folks in person, some on Zoom). These little mics were surprisingly effective (once I remembered to make sure that that laptop running Zoom was using the USB microphone array, not its internal microphone). People online were able to hear even some of the soft-spoken people in the meeting. They're also really easy to set up. I purchased two extras, and used the 6 microphones for a group of 25 people sitting around a u-shaped table.They're not going to be the best sound quality in the world--if you want to ensure every single word is heard, you might want to get individual tabletop mics. But for something easy and affordable that captures the discussion in a room without getting in the way, you can't do much better. Very glad I found them. My only wish is that you could string more than 6 of them together. I might try adding another one or two and see how it goes.",
