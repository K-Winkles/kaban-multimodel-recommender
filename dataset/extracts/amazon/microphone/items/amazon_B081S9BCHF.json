                "reviewText": "I love this mic! Sounds good, low noise, very directional. Ever since getting it I've used it for all my videoconferences. I have it on a mic boom just above my head about 12-18 inches away and it sounds very nice and clean. Allowed me to stop needing to wear headphones during conferences, I could just have the audio coming out of speakers.Aside from this, you can use the mic as a USB device with a PC or you can plug in an analog TRS or TRRS cable, it will automatically detect the configuration of the jack so you can use it with almost any device.I use it as a USB mic with my PC, in analog mode with a Sony A7R4 and have also used it as a USB-C mic with an iPad Pro and with an iIphone through Apples analog adapter. All worked and had great sound.The directionality of the mic will let you put it just below or just above you out-of-shot and still get good sound. It's not magic though, for best quality the rule with mics is \"closer is better\" You will probably get best results 1-2 feet away. Try to get closer if the person is a quiet talker.There are a few minor flaws with the USB mode. One is that the gain control knob has no effect in USB mode, you have to adjust volume levels with PC software which is not as convenient. Also the \"safety channel\" feature doesn't work in USB mode (this is where it records normal audio on one channel and the other channel 20db quieter, so you can recover audio in post production if it suddenly gets too loud and clips). Not sure why these don't work but it would be great if Rode could do a firmware update to fix it.Also the mic is supposed to work with an iPhone through a USB-C to lightning cable. I tried this with a high quality cable I have and it didn't work. Rode support says you have to use their UCB-C to lightning cable. Not sure why this is, maybe they have some active electronics in their cable. I just know I tried several good quality USB-C->lightning cables I had and they did not work.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Video or Podcasting - This is the One Mic To Rule Them All! (+ how to connect via XLR)",
                "reviewText": "I debated over this mic for quite a while. I liked the idea of being able to use it analog, connected directly to my field recorder, camera or phone - plus the ability to connect it directly to my computer digitally via USB. However, my primary use is connected to my field recorder, and I would have much preferred an XLR connector vs the 3.5 mm trs/trrs jack. I just so happened to own a Rode VXLR+, which adapts XLR to 3.5mm, and converts phantom power to 'plug-in power', so I figured I would give the mic a try.At first it did not work, and I almost returned the mic. The mic is intelligent and can switch between trs (camera) and trrs (phone - combo headphone/microphone jack) connectivity, using the provided trrs/trrs cable. The VXLR+ on the other hand... not so intelligent. It is designed for trs connectivity, not trrs. Connecting it via trrs did not work. But, before I boxed the mic up and sent it back, I figured I would try a trs/trs cable... and Voila!The mic sounds incredible! Really good gain, really low noise. While it definitely has a proximity effect, it maintains warmth/depth when booming at around 18\". I made some quick test recordings this way, then A/B tested the unprocessed audio against some of the more professional sounding YouTube channels out there. I honestly think mine sounded better! ;) Using it in a podcast/voice-over fashion, 3\"-6\" away, plugged directly in to my computer, sounded equally amazing. My phone even recognizes the mic via USB! As an \"on-camera\" mic... meh. But the traditional NTG mics, or even the almighty MKH-416 would sound \"meh\" used as an on camera mic. It is just not what you do, if you want good quality audio! IMHO.Buy it!",

                "reviewText": "You can't really go wrong with Rode. I swapped out my VideoMic Pro+ for this NTG option, and I've enjoyed the upgrade in audio! I do a lot of run-and-gun documentary work, so having an on-camera mic that can capture usable audio is crucial! I'd suggest bringing down the gain on your camera and upping the gain on the mic for the best results (in my experience). The shock mount seems to do a pretty good job of avoiding the noise of the mic moving around, so that's a plus. I just wish that the shock mount was black, not red.",
