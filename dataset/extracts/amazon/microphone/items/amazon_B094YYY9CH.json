                "reviewText": "Since I started traveling for work, I have been on a mission to reduce the size/weight of things that I have in my backpack. I used to travel with a medium sized bluetooth speaker that I used in the hotel for music and white noise at night, along with a Jabra 510 that I brought with me to the office for meetings. For the hotel use case, I have since moved to one of those teeny tiny, weird name Chinese brand speakers that literally fit in the palm of your hand and weigh next to nothing. However, even though the sound quality of those are surprisingly good and they have a built-in mic, the voice quality was horrible if you tried to use them for the meetings/speakerphone use case.After doing a bunch of research, I found this Microsoft speakerphone that checks all my boxes for the office scenario. It was small (about the size of a classic video game controller), has a nice hard shell case, is Teams certified, and is lightweight. It is also much cheaper than offerings from Jabra, Yealink, Anker and others. I also really like the built-in cable management. I got used to that feature on the Jabra and did not like options that either offered no cable management, or just had a detachable cable. The sound quality in Teams seems on par or better than with the Jabra and MUCH better than any mini travel speaker/mic combo that I have tried.Only downside that some may have with this is that it does not have bluetooth. But for me, that was not a requirement. I have a bluetooth headset if I needed to be wireless. Plus, for the price ($52 when I bought it), I wouldn't expect that feature.If you are looking for a speaker that you can keep in your travel/office bag without taking up much room, this is one has a good balance between price, sound, build quality, features and size.",

The size and design is nice, the cord management is clever, the speaker has a perfect mid-range sound that is great for voices, and the microphone works very well. Note that this would not be a good choice for a general-purpose speaker, as the sound is really balanced for the midrange. Also, the cord is short, so this would not work with a desktop computer where the speaker needed to be placed further away from the computer.",

                "reviewText": "The Microsoft Modern USB-C speaker and mic sounds really good for its size and the mic has really nice voice pickup as well. I tested this on Linux and Mac and it works perfectly on both. The noise cancellation was really nice and completely eliminated the sound of a leaf blower playing on another computer in the background of my office. It was surprisingly good. The main thing that makes this \"Microsoft\" is the teams button on the front. With my Mac and my Linux computers this button does nothing. The button with the phone handset icon on it also does nothing. The volume up and down as well as the mute buttons work as expected and that's all I really wanted anyway.EDIT: The phone button does work on Mac (have not tried on linux). I have RingCentral for my office phone and when someone calls my work number, the phone button on the speaker flashes. A press of this button and the call is answered. Another press and the phone hangs up.",

                "reviewText": "My company uses MS Teams like a lot of others out there and with the whole remote-working situation, I was looking for some sort of unified solution. I'd tried a couple of other brands but my colleagues complained about my voice sounding hollow and/or muffled at times.Came across this and decided to give it a try and I can say that after 3 months of continued daily use, this works absolutely great.Prior to getting this unit, I was using a unidirectional podcast mic and logitech PC speakers which was definitely good but taking up a lot of space on my desk. This Microsoft speaker allows me to walk around a bit and still be heard quite well when I'm speaking.The only disadvantage is that the speakers sound tiny. I've had to really crank up the volume (>60/100) in order to hear what is being said.As a result, I'm now using this unit only for the mic feature and of course for the ability to answer a call, mute/unmute, join a meeting etc. I've got back to using my logitech PC speakers as the audio output since they seem a lot better coming from both sides.Overall a really good product but wished I'd realized the issue with the tiny speakers earlier (I read the reviews but thought it wouldn't matter that much - I was wrong).",

                "reviewText": "There are very few reviews on this speaker and I was a little skeptical to purchase a $90 speaker for my new PC (after bailing on Apple after 15 years). Any way, I was looking for a minimalistic setup, no bluetooth because of sound delay in video editing and one wire to power the speaker. This fit my needs although expensive, it was worth it. Good build quality. It also works with my Samsung Android smartphone. Frequency response is 200hz-20k hz. Not exactly low frequency for base, but a nice balance of sound and much better than a smartphones built in speaker. This speaker is meant to improve your devices sound. not overwhelm you with theater sound. This wont replace a larger bluetooth speaker as far as sound quality, but its perfect for watching youtube videos where sound isnt as critical.",

                "reviewText": "Really well made conference speaker for WFH set up. I was very sceptical about the mic quality and background noise cancellation. But it very well met my expectations and is better than expected and better than the YouTube reviews say. It easily cancels out non-human background noise like Indian household chores noises like pressure cookers, Ceiling Fans, TV outside the work room etc. The speakers are very good and enough for conference calls at full volume and lot better than inbuilt laptop speakers. If you don't mind a hard wired, non-bluetooth conference speakers and if this is within your budget, go for it. I have tried Plantronics Sync 20 and returned it cos it didn't cancel background noises at all. But this one does a very good job at it an your voice reaches the other side clearly. Happy with this purchase. The shipping took time, but understandable considering it is being imported. It is also costlier than US for the same reason. Thanks to the seller for making it available in Indian market .",
