This has a nice, small form factor, and the neck is pretty flexible, so you can put it behind your display with just the tip showing. There was no need for any drivers or other software - just plug it in, select it as your input device and it works fine. I am not a gamer, so I cannot say how well it meets those needs, but it works perfectly for regular video conference purposes. If you find yourself in a similar situation and need a good-quality mic, try this.",

Good for home studio, Chatting, Skype,Discord, Yahoo Recording, YouTube Recording, Google Voice Search and Steam.My experience #1: Only my voice? not really. Good for home studio? I guess, depending on what you are recording. Chatting? Definately good enough for that. Claim #1 is dubious.Claim #2: You just need to plug the microphone and it will work ! No software to install. A single button to turn it on or off. Compatible with every operating system - Mac OS X Windows Linux - and every PC brand (Apple Asus HP etc)Expereince #2: I connected it to my windows 10 laptop and it worked with no extra effort.Claim #3:Noise cancellation and isolates the main sound source, This USB Microphone is perfect for videoconferencing, Skype, dictation or voice recognition. The audio filter will give you a clear and confident voice. Anti-pop filter included !Experience #3: See experience #1, this is just repeating itself. It does have a windsock/pop filter. It's alright.Claim #4: One click to mute/unmute your microphone,Build-in LED indicator tells you the working status at any time.Built with a mix of metal and heavy duty plastic, it's solid as a tank. It is very stable thanks to its weight.360 Degree Position Adjustable Gooseneck Design --Adopting the design of metal gooseneck pipe pickup the sound from 360-degree with high sensitivityExperience #4: Mute buton works as expected, the LED is kinda bright for my taste but whatever. I would have never called the plastic parts heavy duty, but it doesn't feel cheap. It almost sounded like the base was weighted, but it isn't. The gooseneck works well and keeps position so this is good.Claim #5: TKGOU Customer service 2 years, 30 days unconditional return. We are committed to ensuring that you are 100% satisfied, If you have any questions, please contact us directly.We will provide you with a more friendly and satisfactory service.Experence #5: Worked well enough out of the box, I didn't need their customer support.Overall, not a bad microphone for the price.",

                "reviewText": "Ever since the stay-at-home days started, I've been using my Logitech G533 gaming headset for all my computer audio needs. It has a great mic (and sounds fantastic, BTW), but after months of near daily use I got tired of wearing a big headset for every call. I purchased this mic due to the reasonable price and the many rave reviews, and I am not disappointed!As a technical communicator, I need something with quality sound for recording as well as calls. I tested recording on this mic in OBS Studio and I'm quite pleased with how good my voice sounded. People on calls have told me that I come through loud and clear as well. It picks me up clearly from up to 2 feet away, and since it's omnidirectional it will pick up both me and another source of sound in the room, which is important for Zoom karaoke! As long as it's not right next to my laptop's speakers, it will not pick up stray audio. My jet-engine-loud air conditioner does sometimes come through if I'm set up in the living room, right next to the intake vent.The hardware itself feels sturdy, including the highly-flexible metal neck, and the base (with a 4x5\" footprint) has a good weight to it. The mechanical ON/OFF switch, which has a solid in-and-out click, gives me peace of mind when I want to be sure I'm muted on a call. The ON light is fairly bright, so I covered it in a LightDims original strength sticker and it no longer bugs me (see picture). The cord length is just about perfect, since I'm on a laptop and didn't want to deal with a massive loop of cable cluttering up my desk, but it seems long enough to reach the back of any desktop case without any issues.Overall, this is an easy-to-use and high-quality microphone that has everything I need and nothing I don't. It's one of the most satisfying purchases I've made all year, and I highly recommend it if you need a good inexpensive mic.",

I did have someone tell me the clarity was much better than my computer mic however, every so often it sounded like I was losing connection as they would hear every other word. I tend to speak fast so when I slowed down, all was better.",
