                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Another great product from Levn.The ear cushions are so soft and that makes me feel extremely comfortable wearing it. Additionally, the headset is pretty light weight and it fits perfectly, and I feel like nothing on my head whenever I put it on.The mic and sound quality are also good.Because it\u2019s a wired headset, the setup is very straight forward, you just have to plug in the cable directly to the USB port on your computer or docking station. The cord lenght is also long enough for you to stand up and move around with it.This will be one of my favorite headset that I would like to use for my daily meetings at work.Overall, for this good and affordable wired headset, I would recommend it to other people.",

I highly recommend. The only complaint might be, is the mic isn't reversible. It is only left side. That is fine for me but others might not like.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this headset initially for customer service rep job, wfh. While it is a great headset for entertainment like watching movie, listening to music, the volume is fantastic! BUT, for work when in a call w customers, even if I put the volume on max it doesn't sound as good as it was when I\u2019m just using it for listening to a music or watching videos online. It sounds low-mid vol even if it\u2019s already on max volume. I am not sure what\u2019s the reason behind it (not sure if it\u2019s bc I\u2019m on a 3rd party software for work or what but yeah, there\u2019s that).Another key point is, I use this headphones for 8hrs of my job, the cushion on the ear is not the greatest and it makes the side of my ear hurt by wearing it for a long period of time. (+As someone who wears glasses, I have to lift up the thing that rests on the side of the ear cause it hurts after period of time).The quality of the mic/audio is great. Callers can hear me clear for the most part, no static, doesn\u2019t get weird comments anymore like I sound like I\u2019m in a tunnel or on speaker even if I\u2019m not (heard these comments when I was still using a gaming headphones that was built for good sound but not so much for the mic since gaming is a whole other thing that doesn\u2019t necessarily require users to speak, LOL).Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a 50/50, it\u2019s good for its price but for the sole purpose of why I bought the item, it\u2019s not the best in terms of comfortability & technicality w the volume \u201cwork wise as csr using 3rd party sofetware\u201d but I guess it will do since I already bought it and it\u2019s doable after all.",

Wired headsets are more reliable and easy to use for zoom meetings when i am at my desk. I like the bluetooth ones when I am on the go, and i use those even biking and kayaking! But this one, like all the products this company makes is of superior quality, great sound, easy use, and sooooo comfortable. It is really pretty amazing how inexpensive they are. I do not normally expect such a great product for so little money. I hope this company expands into other electronics. For example, I would love a reliable back lit keyboard for my iPad mini 6. I am hoping the great engineers in this company would consider expanding their product line in that way! Grateful for their products and their excellent and personal customer service.",
