                "reviewText": "I got this microphone to go with my Mackie audio mixer for the purpose of simultaneously recording my voice and game audio with stereo separation. The microphone works very well, but it doesn't seem to have an easy way to mount it to anything that's near floor level (in my case, about 24 inches (60 cm) above the ground). While there are microphone stands, nothing I've seen gets that low (I may have been looking at the wrong things though).Thus, I'd need some handyman type skills to build something that would work, a pair of pieces of metal with rotation points can be used, with a sort of rotating cone-shape part at the end for securing the microphone should allow for it to be mounted. My setup isn't really ideal, however, for voice recording, so I need to make some changes to my computer desk area and build stuff to make it work more optimally, such as pointing away from the background noise instead of toward it. It is a bit on the heavy side though so I do have to take that into account.",

I swear it made \u2018ok\u2019 singers sound better and clearer, lol!It\u2019s better than just a karaoke mic though. It can definitely be used for lead or background vocalists, spoken word, presentations\u2026Nice price point as well.Great purchase !",

Wow I am impressed. It's lightweight, and the sound quality is great, especially considering the price. If you're looking for a beginner mic, this is it. You'll get a lot of bang for your buck. In fact, unless you're overly obsessive like me, I see no reason why you wouldn't continue to use this mic well beyond your newbie stage.",
