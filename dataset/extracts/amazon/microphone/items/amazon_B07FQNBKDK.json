                "reviewText": "This was my third purchase from popVoice... and they sure didn't disappoint!I had a lavaliere mic previously, but it was a lightning-connector one that could only be used with an Apple iOS product. But I really appreciated the convenience of not having to rely on the onboard mics for audio, especially if I know I'll be recording in an area with a lot of ambient noise.This lavaliere mic did NOT disappoint! It works GREAT with my 1st Gen iPad Pro. I did, however, have a slight issue with getting the mic to be recognized by my iMac. But once I realized that PoPVoice provided a solution with one of my other purchases (a USB mic adapter), the mic was up and running. Even better, I'd reached out to the company for guidance, and they answered quickly with the info I'd already figured out!The sound quality is excellent... the cable length is ideal... and the ease of use, as well as providing an adapter for PC computers (a rarity with a lot of companies) means this company really cares about giving you the best quality for the best price.I do a lot of \"Self-Tape Auditions\" for commercials and online training, so I do a LOT of in-home recording. Having a quality mic that's reliable is critical. I've also used PoPVoice's desktop mic to record VoiceOvers from home... so, again, I can vouch for the quality of their product. I HIGHLY recommend this mic!!!",

                "reviewText": "I've been giving this microphone a go through the perspective of a content creator and indie filmmaker. I've been looking at affordable solutions that could help with one of the most important aspect of content creation, and that's the importance of getting useable audio, especially at the budget end. This mic is a great option for those who are wanting to get into content creation, and need something to add to the quality of their audio.One of the best solutions for capturing quality audio is to record your media using your camera of choice, as well as have an often a dedicated external source capture the very same take just out of camera shot, then synch them in post. This is still one of my favorite methods, however this setup can cost extra money that isn't in a first time filmmaker's budget, and that's where this mic does a great job at coming inbetween.The Pop-Voice lav microphone comes in at 16ft long, and includes an extra clip, a TRS adapter plug (for use with devices that aren't typically your phone, you'll have this attached often),and 4 different colored windscreen caps, in case you are using more than one. The adapter is especially considerate, as I have a couple didn't lav products in my collection, several of which have a TRRS connection like this one, but no adapter to adapt to your other audio devices, which is silly.The build of the lav is surprising sturdy and standardized, much like many of the lavs you may order that can cost double the price of this kit. The included clip is very sturdy, and doesn't feel like it'll fall apart with extended use, or harm you or your talent from rough edges.This mic is a great way to get much closer audio from your camera while the 16ft length gives you plenty to work with in distance to make sure both your shot and audio are ideal. I will be ordering groups of these from now on, and even if I was totally wrong and half of them blow up within 6 months, I still made my investment in them back several times over.",

                "reviewText": "The pictures might look weird but I promise, IT WORKS, let me explain haha.The mic on my HyperX headset gave out and nothing I did could fix it. I could go over all the fixes I attempted but that's a whole other story.I eventually opted to buy this mic and attach it to where the old mic used to be using my own velcro ties, adhesive clip, and the clip it comes with. Works FANTASTIC. Friends said I sound pretty clear. Of course I don't have the \"rotate to mute\" feature my headset had before but this is a great, cheap fix. I'm not even worried about replacing it asap like I thought I would be; works so great that I'm taking my time to wait for a really good sale on certain headsets I've been eyeing. Comes with the adapter so you can use it on PC just fine.Just make sure you don't have the mic directly in front of your mouth. Instead, have it around neck height or at least below chin; I think it's meant to be worn clipped onto shirt collar instead of right in front of your mouth like a headset mic so if you try that and talk, it picks up wet mouth sounds and can make you sound a little weird even with the foam cover HAHA. As long as you align it like I said, you sound completely normal. My headset mic can extend to all the way below my chin and off to the side so it's fineNoise cancellation isn't too great, can still pick up my typing very loudly actually, but Discord cancels that out for me. However, I think this mic was meant for more of a podcast/interview sort of thing so maybe it will work better for that. It also did kind of pick up my voice when I talked further away but it not only sounded a bit faint, but it cut in and out and you could barely make out what I was saying.The cable is INCREDIBLY long so if you plan on using it for the same reason I'm using mine, you're going to have a lot of tied up cable at the end. If you're gonna use it for its intended purposes and need a long cable then I think you're gonna be happy.",
