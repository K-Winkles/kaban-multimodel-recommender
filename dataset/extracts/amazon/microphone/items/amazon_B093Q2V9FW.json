                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. In the video I got I had my music playing on my TV and the mic playing on the small speaker it came with. It works great! Mic sounds as it should though some slight delays with the echoes. However you can change the echoing through the mics! You can also connect your device and the mic to the small speaker and at the same time and it sounds exactly the same and fairly balanced. The mic doesnt drown out the rest of the audio at all.For its price, this is very good. Fun, and looks very clean and neat and not cheaply built. It comes with a thorough guide that tells you all you need to know to get this thing working and a USB cable to charge the 2 mics with. Highly recommend for people who like to do karaoke without the hassle of a giant machine.",

It's all so fun. But as well it has ur own voice you can vibe to. I can't wait for Christmas to let these vocals harmonize along with the laffs and barrels of fun.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased mic in January as a gift for my little niece. She barely used it in 6 months . I found out why today. The unit stopped working and would only turn on if plugged in to a power outlet. Once you unplugged it, it wouldnt turn on. The battery is probably faulty but im disappointed that it stopped working after a couple weeks of light use.Poor engineering. I cant return for a refund because that window has expired... but reaching out to company about a warranty. If i can get a replacement and enjoy it like other users, it will change my opinion and my review.Update 6-24, company reached out promptly and offered to replace and ship the item to me. They also apologized for the faulty unit. So customer service is a positive and usually makes all the difference. Since I received the replacement, the microphone is pairing well and works as advertised. If something were to happen to change my review, I would be shocked based on the other reviews on here. A friend went and purchased the same unit, different color, and their kid seems to enjoy it. 4 stars for price, customer service, and the product. Features arent \"kid friendly\", meaning the buttons arent intuitive for a 3yr old. I wish it was louder, but honestly I have nothing to compare it to. Also allows you to play radio stations if you are into singing over that, or dont want to use youtube or another music app.",

                "reviewText": "The microphone is very light weight and fairly simple to use. It does make everyone sound like a robot initially but if you slide the remix \u201cbutton\u201d all the way down it will fix that. It paired to my phone easily and the next/previous controls work well to change from one song to another. It has a radio option but as far as I can tell it doesn\u2019t have an antenna so it\u2019s nearly impossible to pick up a radio station. It has a record button but I\u2019m still unable to figure out how to record and playback. The direction are extremely vague. The reason I gave 3 stars is because the microphone will only pick up your voice if you speak directly into the top of the microphone and your mouth has to be so close that your lips are literally touching the tip of the microphone. If you speak directly into the tip of the microphone, with your lips actually touching it you will hear yourself through the speaker. However, if you move the tip of the microphone even the slightest bit away from your mouth it will not pick up your voice. If you speak into the sides of the microphone it will not pick up your voice.If your ok with having to speak directly into the tip of a microphone and holding it so close to your mouth that your lips are touching it then this microphone would be perfect for you. If you want a microphone that you can hold in a normal position and sing into it without pressing your lips against it then I highly recommend looking elsewhere.I would love to return it and purchase a different one but I bought it months ago and put it up for Christmas for my daughter. By the time Christmas came and she opened it I was past the return window. I guess I should have tested it out when I received it but I didn\u2019t want to give my daughter an opened gift and the reviews were fairly good so I trusted that it would work properly.",
