They both also have buttons on them so they can be turned off when not in use. We use these for karaoke at our camp & they make it easy for duo\u2019s when singing. You just use the bluetooth to connect to your desired device. Super easy to use.",

                "reviewText": "These things are great! For the money, absolutely amazing.However, the issues are that they are not very loud and have no volume control.I used these plugged into a Mackie Freeplay. I usually use 2 Shure SM58 mics, but I wanted the mobility of wireless mics. For my last karaoke party, I had these microphones plugged into one of the jacks and an SM58 in the other.The comparison was a bit embarrassing for these mics, but they are two mics for less than half of one SM58.. so makes sense.The main issue was the volume. I had the input for these mics cranked all the way up, as well as the master volume of the speaker. I then had to turn down the level for the SM58 and the Bluetooth/aux channel(karaoke track audio) in order to match with the wireless mics. In the end, I have more mics and more freedom, but less overall volume. Still, they were loud enough to work, just barely.Battery life was amazing. About 2 hours of use and they were still over 80%. I used 2800mAh rechargeable batteries.I am considering buying another set! I wish they came in more colors.Also worth adding, I would pay an extra $15 if they had volume control and rechargeable internal batteries... Another brand on here has microphones like that, but they use a bigger receiver and I choose these for the tiny receiver and mixed colors.",

They don't have a volume control on the mic it's self but you use the volume on the device your using it with. They have perfect Ling distant range. But if the volume is up really loud on your device, don't get to close to it or you'll get an ear piercing feed back sound.Highly recommend for a low cost microphone.",
