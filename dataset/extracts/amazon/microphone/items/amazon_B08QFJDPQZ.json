                "reviewText": "Bought two of these cause they are easy to connect and use, while providing good sound quality. I would use these for zoom meeting and in person presentations, but the only major downflaw is that they dont recharge like they are supposed to. Had this problem with the two that I bought and a replacement mike that was sent to me when i asked for an exhange. I tried many different chargers and outlets. So three different microphones didnt charge and they have a special 5v battery that cant be bought anywhere. Dont get these cause once they die, you arent going to be able to use it anymore.",

So far exceeded our expectations. No engine interference and no noise interference. Sound is really clear and enjoyable to listen to even at higher speeds while underway.My only concerns our how long the batteries will last throughout the day and how to charge them up over night as our boat is not plugged into shore power at night.All in all a very good buy",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE (I had to buy a new one) 6/27/23ok so the one I previously purchased ended up breaking. The button came off and then it was all downhill from there BUT I really liked this mic and it lasted a while so I came back for another one. I was disappointed when I received it and saw that I was sent the same microphone but a completely different receiver and it wouldn\u2019t have been a big issue except the receiver does not work unless it\u2019s plugged in even though it should charge and be used wireless. I will be returning and I guess i\u2019ll have to find another mic next time. Why was the receiver switched to a cheap off brand from its original?NEW UPDATE: It\u2019s been over a YEAR and this mic is still going strong despite being dropped multiple times OOOPS lol Still a Great Buy!EDIT: Its been over a month and still works great!I've used this microphone over the weekend to see how it does and this is my honest review. I am a DJ and I need to have reliable equipment so I was skeptical about buying this item but glad I did. It connects soon as you turn it on and I can walk all over the club with no reception issues or distortion. I charged it as soon as I unboxed and the charge lasted multiple nights I turned the mic off whrn I wasnt talking of course, will try to remember to update this review after a month or so. I DJ every week so let's see how this holds up.",
