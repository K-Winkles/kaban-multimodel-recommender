                "reviewText": "I ordered this mic shortly before our wedding and it arrived early on time but unfortunately the mic I ordered had some issues making it unusable. I reached out to Bietrun and they priority shipped me out another mic in one day to a different address (2 hours away where our wedding was) and saved the day. They were super easy to deal with and the mic is great quality and super easy to set up and connect. You literally just turn the mic and the transmitter on and they immediately sink together (made things much easier for friend who was acting dj for the actual ceremony) sounds great, worked about 50 yards away from our speaker which was impressive and has a healthy weight (makes me feel like it\u2019s a quality mic and not plastic garbage). Thanks again Bietrun you guys were the hero of my wedding and really helped take a lot of the stress of wedding planning off my shoulders! 10/10 would buy again and recommend to others!",

I tried holding down the Hi/Lo button and let it flash through all the channels while turning on the receiver and still could not get it to pair. I had to use a back up mic I had (fortunately) for the show. I do not recommend and will not buy again.",
