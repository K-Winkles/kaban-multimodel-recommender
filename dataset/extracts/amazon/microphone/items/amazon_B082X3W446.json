The main difficulty in design is with the battery powered receiver. Lasts maybe 2hrs tops. DO NOT use mike while receiver is plugged in to ac charging power. It will add a terrible buzz to the sound quality. This was a bit of a challenge in a hectic camp situation where coordinating charging times was not a convenience to us.",

                "reviewText": "These mics are great as backup mics, or karaoke mics. However, you will need to boost the gain on the mixing board to get the same feel as a Shure mic, for instance. The battery life is not great, but that can be solved by simply letting it charge while you use it. Tweak the settings to your preferred sound and I promise you, these are definitely worth the money spent. Great to add to the collection!!",

                "reviewText": "Bought this because of the small size of the receiver, and I can plug it in directly to my mixer or powered speaker. It works well, and the sound quality is great! No issues with it so far. The only things I have noticed are, 1) when you press the power button on the microphone, there is a click in the speaker. It's not terrible, but I turn the microphone off between announcements, mostly to save battery power. So, there are clicks that happen. 2) when you power on the microphone, there is a slight delay while it connects to the receiver. It means you just have to remember to wait a bit before talking into the microphone.",

He has a phone app but they all chatter at the same time and the phone just gives up. This way, we can have two mikes they can pass around. Well, it didn't work. Apple would not recognize the input module. I contacted Hotec response and WHAT A response, excellent, detailed, insightful. Working together, we found out some Apple laptops work, others don't. So, what next. They suggested I buy a $7 Hotec cable and try again. I bought it, no good. Then I plugged in a USB audio dongle into my laptop and used the Hotec cable to reduce from the 1/4\" plug on the interface device to the 1/8\" dongle input. It worked like MAGIC. You can use both mikes and everything works great. I'm an Electrical Engineer who works with all sorts of complex equipment, but this had me stumped. Thank you Hotec Support!!!",
