Might be worth noting converter for 1/4\" AV is included for your instrument. I've tested output for the mics on my PC and evaluated in Audacity. The raw output gave a waveform that passes ACX standard for audiobook submission. With NO adjustments, no less. Noise floor is flat and well below -60 even in my open room with no baffling or sound suppression. The waveform is neatly \"flat topped\" and steady, I read it at -7. I gave it a boost to -3db and it was perfect. This shows that in live use this set will perform very well. I may be using it for You Tubing rather than my nice AKG Condenser mic. Not only for freedom of moevement but quality of output in an unprotected, (not studio), environment. I expect to be very satisfied with this purchase. The attached snap shows one verse of \"Red River Valley\" and the result of an ACX check. That's just sweet!",

I would have no problem purchasing these again. The only problem I had was that the foam over the one mic is missing but I'm going to reach out to the manufacturer for a replacement. Not the sellers fault as this was a new unopened product. I would highly recommend Pyle as it is the best product for the money as far as the quality and the sound. Much more expensive microphones that I have heard didn't sound as good.",

                "reviewText": "So the unit works as intended. The instructions are a little fuzzy, but when its paired- it works.The microphones are a different story. The are pretty useless.I have a sony ECM-V1 lav microphone. It works with this unit- but you need to have some good amplification on the mixer because its a bit quieter than the pyle ones.Adding that microphone to this system changed it from sounding bleh to sounding quite decent. For the money of the ECM-v1 and this (which you can typically find used) its a steal.If you think the sound is bad, I suggest another microphone. Just note that with some mics the attenuation will be far greater than the pyle mics, so you may need to increase the gain on the mixer (or other device you have it connected to).",

                "reviewText": "As mentioned in the title, this item is useless. If the lavalier mic is clipped on to the shirt, it does not pickup voice. The headset is too small to wear above head as shown in picture. It has to wrap around back of head because the headband is too small. And the headset picks up all your breath because the system does not have a low pass filter, unlike other more expensive wireless mics. The mic needs to be pushed hard into the threaded input before it engages, so it feels like the input will not last long. This is a toy, not for professional use and is going back for a refund.",

                "reviewText": "Our Cub Scout pack purchased this headset mic for our PA system, to be used at Pinewood Derby, Blue & Gold Banquet, and other events. We're a large pack of 100+ scouts, so we needed something with good range and sensitivity to help project over a rowdy crowd of K-5 scouts and their parents.I'm a big guy so the headset actually fit better when I turned it upside-down from the picture, going behind the neck instead of over my head. The mic sensitivity is great, speech comes over crisp and bright...very clear. The range is excellent at well over 100' and even through two brick walls. I was pleasantly surprised at how well the lapel mic worked. It has to be directly below your mouth so a shirt collar won't work, but clipped to a v-neck polo or top button on a scout uniform worked perfectly. I'm 6'4\" and the cord length on both the headset and the lapel mic was enough to reach to the mic pack on my belt without issues.",

I also ordered another product from a different company that came with many other accessories. But the gain and sound quality of that product was very poor. This product Pyle PDWMU112 is very good and has great sound quality. With low-volume settings too, the gain is great. I am using it for flute and the sound is very good. I will recommend this product",
