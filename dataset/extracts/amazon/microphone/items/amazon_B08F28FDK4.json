                "reviewText": "I'm not even sure where to start. This is the first negative review I have ever left on a product. Here goes:I opened the still-sealed package to find the product box was not closed at all and was damaged, possibly from being shipped that way. The contents were just shoved in haphazardly, the wires were crammed in without any care, even though the twist tie was right there, and it would have taken seconds to loop and tie the wire and ship it the right way. I can't imagine shipping something off in this condition to a customer. The microphone itself has chips and scuffs in the paint and was definitely well-used before being returned by the last person.All this was definitely frustrating, but I could have forgiven it if the microphone sounded good. But I won't know if it works for a while. The product description has a giant \"3.5M\" in it, which lead me to think that the plug and wire were for a 3.5M jack with an 11-foot long 1/4\" cord. It's not, this plug is gigantic, and I will need to purchase an adapter before I can use it. I will take the blame for not reading better, but it definitely feels sleezy to me, the way the product description is worded, since 3.5M is a pretty universal and well-used jack size for microphones.After I see if this microphone actually works, I will come back and update the review. I'm not going to hold my breath and I'm not going to bother returning it because I don't have time to fiddle with it. I'll just buy an adapter. So far, I would not recommend, based on this experience :(",

A strong push into it's slot is all it took to fix. It looks cheap and nasty and I suppose it is, but, I wanted a mic to plug into an amp to do the announcements on Karaoke in between singers/songs and it works excellently for this. Clear speech and picks up just my voice - absolutely brilliant for what I wanted it for. Have not tried to sing into it, so cannot comment further",
