                "reviewText": "These are great. Im not the karaoke guy so the kids have always been stuck with mics they think look good and want because the ad looks good which turn out to be the ones you have to yell into, are choppy, or just plainly don't work. These are non of those, and sound very professional. Really can not say enough good about these. One could argue that the mics use AA batteries but I actually am liking the fact that I can just run to the gas station and replace them rather than trying to source some proprietary rechargeable battery that is over priced. Great buy",

Insert batteries, charge base, plug base into amp, turn on, and sing away. Each mic is on a different channel, but you can't adjust the levels separately. You can change channels by unscrewing the battery cap and tapping the switch right or left; display shows channel and frequency. Black mic connects and sounds fine; red shows it's on but doesn't connect; no sound comes out. I tested the mics and base separately and together and cycled through all the channels. Would have awarded 5 stars if both mics worked.",
