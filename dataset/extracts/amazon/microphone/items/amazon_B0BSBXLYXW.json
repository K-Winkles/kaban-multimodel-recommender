It's not just good-looking on my desk, but it also sounds amazing and is super easy to use.Setting it up was a piece of cake. I just plugged it into my computer, and I was good to go. It feels really sturdy and well-made, so I know it'll last.The best part is how clear it makes my voice sound. It cancels out background noise so well, whether I'm recording, streaming, or on a video call. Plus, it can do different sound settings for different situations.The buttons on it are simple to use. You can adjust the volume and turn it on or off easily. It even has cool colored lights on the bottom that you can change to match your style or link it to other Logitech color schemes w/ the LG Hub Software.In short, the Logitech Yeti GX microphone is a fantastic choice if you're into creating content, streaming, or just want better sound quality for your calls. It looks great, sounds great, and is super easy to use. I'm really happy with it!",

The look and style and performance is very professional and aesthetically pleasing. I love that this microphone is a quick use dynamic mic that is plug and play. I like that the blue voice software is optional to use for adjusting sounds settings and or adding additional effects and features. But this microphone is simple to manage the volume control directly on the microphone which can be set and locked. I\u2019m currently using for my game play, as well as my live streams, so the noise cancellation is a big help when I\u2019m clicking my mouse or if there any unwanted background noises.",

Also the rgb light is really cool and you can adjust that as well in the software. I highly recommend this microphone. Definitely a great quality for the price. I would have paid twice the amount for it. And it\u2019s super light and easy to move if you record podcast or anything on the go",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I would not use this for music (you need the $5000 mics to sound your best), but I would use this for basic voice and especially for dictation. It cancels noise, for me, and does not pick up sound or voices that are farther away than say, 2 or 3 feet, including my own. I like that. It means I can talk my words into a software program on MAC or WINDOWS. When I have Microsoft Word open on both, and have the same file open, if I dictate into one the same words are popping up simultaneously on BOTH the Windows and Mac machines' screens. It's cool and this must be a benefit of this mic. This mic is hearing me really well as it cancels out all other noises. That makes the dictation work much faster. This mic is a champ and works great on Mac OS X (on my Mac mini M2 Studio) and also on Windows 10 (my Microsoft Surface Studio computer). It switches seamlessly without glitch, ALWAYS at the press of a button my my recently installed USB Switch Selector box. I have the mic mounted to an arm of my WALI computer desktop pole which hangs a lot of stuff including the USB switch box, headphones, and lights, etc.",
