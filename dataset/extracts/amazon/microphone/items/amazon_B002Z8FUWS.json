                "reviewText": "Awesome road mics, awesome studio mics! I have had the three pack of the e604's for about a year now, and now expanded with this kit. I can easily say they are well worth the money. The clips seemed like they were going to be fragile, but they are very flexible and tough. They mount well to my triple flange and cast hoops as well as my congas. Even a flat EQ sounds good through most house mains, and it is a huge peace of mind bringing my own backline instead of rolling the dice with busted up sm57's. The condensers aren't going to compete with any Neumann's, but these are very solid and a fraction of the cost. It sounds funny, but the case is also really well made. This set comes with me to all my shows and recording sessions, so it's nice to have the case for when they roll around in my trunk with the rest of the drum hardware.",
