                "reviewText": "The price was pretty low, so I knew I would be getting what I paid for.The construction is solid, it looks nice, but the audio volume that comes from it is weak.I connected it to a personal PA speaker (designed for this purpose), and even at the speakers full volume, the mic is no louder than regular speech level. No feedback could be produced.But when I connected another mic I got immediate feedback, which of course meant a higher mic volume produced.It can work great as a toy, or for younger children so they can't annoy their parents very much. But don't expect much (volume) from this low priced mic.",

I have yet to try it on an instrument, but that\u2019s not really what this product is for. Noteworthy- the cable is simply attached to the base of the microphone, and terminates with a 1/4\u201d plug. This is not standard for the sm-58 this product is styled after. I guess that means you won\u2019t lose it, but that also means if the cable is damaged, the microphone is useless.",
