                "reviewText": "My husband started DJing again and the first thing I loved about these mics were that they were wireless and connected via Bluetooth. This will be great when he does parties or weddings. I also like that they are two different colors so you won't mix them up. As far as battery longevity I can not attest as I have not had them long enough. With that said I am excited to have these.",
