                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Possibly the best wireless mic bang for the buck you can find",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This may be one of the best sets of wireless mics you could possibly buy for the money...First, let me point out the downsides:1. Yes the frequency range of one mic will be out of spec - so you could not use that one, and buy a second set and only use one of the others too, and still have a heck of a deal.2. I can find no way to have them power on when power is applied - which means you will have to power on your rack and then power on each of these receivers manually (unless I am missing something)3. They are not rack mountable without placing them on a rack shelf and using double side tape4. The antennas are not meant to fold flat for easy storage in a gig bag, you would be best to take them off when transporting5. The antennas are on the back, so if you do put them in a rack, they will be behind a bunch of metal that will reduce their range6. On a dark stage, you cannot see the polarity, so you might have someone put the batteries in and not have power and have to do it all over again - also, some battery brands are a little too snug, like Kirkland (Costco) so they are hard to pull out once you put them in.Okay okay - so what makes them great then?1. They are built very well. As others have noted, they are heavy in your hand, they feel about as good as our Sennheisers, like a real piece of pro equipment. While we have not dropped one, I feel like if we did, it would not shatter into pieces like other budget mics.2. They are good looking and when mixed with our pro-level gear on stage, people cannot tell we didn't spend a grand.3. The range is more than adequate. We have not found a stage that is larger than the coverage - however, our receivers are in a rack ON THE STAGE, not at the back of a sanctuary or something.4. The infrared frequency setup is instantaneous and accurate - it's never failed to work correctly, unlike some other brands, even higher end gear.5. The audio quality exceeds all expectations. I record every show, and that means I have isolated audio from each mic and member and can easily compare a Sennheiser wired to a Sennheiser wireless to an SM57 to the Innopow. And guess what? In almost all cases, the Innopow sounds superb! I'm not yanking your chain here, on quiet to loud songs, they are pretty amazing. And their pattern is pretty good, so they don't pick up too much noise like drums, and they are not bad about feedback. Like most mics, if you move up on it tight, bass response can be amazing. The only weak point is that if you have someone who belts AND cups the mic, it will distort a lot easier than a 57.6. The price is a big point for us because while we have 3 higher end Sennheisers systems that were bought for key members of our band, other members have come and gone and others have made no investment - these are perfect for them and for guest mics. It's hard to justify buying everyone else's gear, so they get what they get right? At least they get a very decent mic that they are not embarrassed to be behind!There you go, 6 pros and my 6 cons.... The pros far outweigh the cons for sure.And I have a follow-up after purchasing my first system in February, I bought a second system after one of the two mics died.... Not sure what happened, it wasn't dropped, but the batteries would heat up red hot as soon as you would turn it on.Why isn't this a \"con\"? Because everything has troubles - my expensive bass amp is dead, died at the same show!Rather than cry about it, I ordered another set of mics. I mean, that price, right?But wait - there's more... On a whim, I contacted the seller and told them what happened, early on a sunday morning after our gig... and by Monday morning, they had replied to me and said it was probably a solder ball on the circuit board - and they sent out a replacement....I had a replacement from them in time for rehearsal on Wednesday.... Used it at Friday and Saturday night's shows and sound as good as ever.Meanwhile, my expensive bass amp is in the shop until the middle of next week before they can even look at it......So, it's not Shure or AT or Sennheiser, but I would not (and did not) hesitate to buy again or recommend to my friends.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Truly Impressed [professionals review]",
                "reviewText": "To start off, I have a degree in sound engineering and have worked mobile DJing, Radio and Clubs/Festivals for over 15 years. I have used the best systems out there and owned many wired/wireless mic setups myself. My experience with these mics is only over two events and extensive testing at home before I took them on the road. I prefer these mics to my earlier $400 Sennheiser XSW 2-835-A and my current $300 Shire BLX24/PG58 for build, sound quality, features and reception. I would like to check back in a year after many more gigs and rentals before determining their long term reliability, but for the price, as it stands now\u2026. WOWMy initial testing was done in a large venue where I had 290 feet line of sight (measured) and was able to walk around brick walls down hallways and outdoors with line of sight interrupted. I wish I had a GoPro running for the tests so I could upload my results but you will have to trust me. I won\u2019t bore you with too many specifics but here are a few that really matter.First off the receptions first weak spot was not until 150ft from the receiver where I was outside the building on the other side of a brick wall and even then there was only slight fuzz to the signal, another 50 ft (200ft and the mic occasionally dropped a beat and became what I consider unusable in a mobile DJ type situation. Line of sight these are even more impressive where I did not notice the slight fuzz (very quiet) until 240-250ft, *the manufactures claimed performance. I was although able to go until the full 290ft of the room with only the very occasional dropout and noticeable fuzz, and this was with my hand covering the entire bottom of the mic (the transmitter) and standing away from the receiver station. Even when the IR on the mic isn\u2019t pointed to the receiver as you are supposed to do while establishing a connection between the transmitter and receiver, I found that at 250ft the mics reconnected immediately with no issues after being turned off and back on again.The multifunction power button on the bottom of the mic makes for a great clickable feel and is a clever place to hide the \u201cMute\u201d so it does not accidentally get pressed. The screen is backlit (turns off after a short idle) with information for the group, channel, frequency, and battery level. The cardioid pattern is tighter than most and closer to that of a super cardioid microphone. The rear rejection is fantastic. The frequency response is more lively and warm than many $500 mics and will work better or worse depending on the person who uses it. It also feels just as solid as the most expensive microphones in the game. Would I trust it with a 1k person crowd at one of my production companies events? Yes, I already have.Time will tell with the dependability and reliability of this setup, which is most important when you are talking about pro audio applications. This will more than meet your needs if you just want a good karaoke mic or are running small private functions. For big events and gigs I suggest having a second mic setup (as with any brand microphone) as a backup. I hope this helps you while making your next microphone purchase.[UPDATE April 30th 2019]These guys have seen action about 15 times now. This past weekend MC Butterfingers dropped the mic while he was flailing around. The mic has no distinguishable dents or scuffs and still works like a charm. It still hasn't received the reputation of an SM58 but I think that instilled a little more confidence for me on upcoming gigs. In fact, I just purchased a second pair for my rentals rig.",

The built quality is amazing, and being mobile in the entire house with those mics without tripping over wires during karaoke night is incredible! I love them, easy set up! From the Amazon store, the pictures showing the handheld Mic with a more reddish colour when in fact it is orange. Not a big fan of the orange colour but they do not stay on while using them. The lights turns off very quickly. That is another amazing feature. Now I'm just waiting for the gift mentioned inside the box (extra Mic).",
