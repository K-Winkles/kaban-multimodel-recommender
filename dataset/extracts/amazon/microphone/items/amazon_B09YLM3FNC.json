                "reviewText": "I am an avid buyer of affordable tech.I have bought $10 webcams, $15 mice, $20 headsets, $15 capture cards, and *several* mics in the $50 and below range.So when I say that for the price, this mic absolutely blows anything I've ever bought as a budget streamer and tech user outta the water? That's not a lie.This mic is affordable and pretty easy to set-up. It comes mounted onto a mic stand that is pretty mediocre all things considered, but was easy to unscrew and mount onto a boom arm. It sounds great.I know very little about sound mixing, so being able to pop this bad boy in my computer and doing minimal to edit how it sounds is pretty rad in my personal opinion. It sounds great out of the box.Like most mics, it does pick up on some background noise. This can easily be fixed with a noise gate. The mic picks up on my typing- even connected to a boom mic and with a noise gate on- but it's perfectly alright and not at all an issue!I love it.It has touch buttons that are very easy to use, and the volume gain nob is alright. I will say that I find the light button being a touch button in the location that it's at (towards the bottom back of the mic) is a little inconvenient for when one moves a mic back and forth on a boom arm, but it's not really that much of a trouble. The push to mute is really rad, and the colour types are pretty sick as well.I would buy from this brand again! :)",

One of the various color combos are bound to fit your setup aesthetic! I always had mine on blue cuz that's my favorite color!",

                "reviewText": "Not an audiophile or has any real experience with mics or setups. I originally got a T669 in 2020 based on all the positive reviews and that was a solid solid solid microphone that I was really happy with except primarily the lack of mute button and how much background noise it picked up. I didn't need to upgrade, but I was in the mood to try this out and I got it for a great price so the decision was made easier.Overall sound-wise, I think it's really similar sounding to the T669. I would have liked a little more low end tones picked up, but it sounds clear throughout the range. I think people who know their way around mics probably could get it to sound even better, but it's plenty good enough for my untrained ear. The biggest upgrade was the improvement in background noise. I tried both mics in Audacity and it's a noticeable difference in background noise. I liked the fact that I could just pop it onto the mic arm that came with the T669 and the RGB lights are awesome. It provides some cool ambience as I'm just working on my computer. It's great to be able to switch off the lights too, or have them shut off with the computer as well. I like how the smiley face isn't really all that noticeable on the pop filter - which looks and works great.The only beefs I have with it are that the shock mount is pretty huge - I miss the compactness of the T669. This mic is already bigger before you consider the shock mount. The other gripes are that the gain knob is on the rear when it could easily have been in the same position on the front. You can operate it based on feel, but it just makes more sense to have it on the front - which frees up the rear to have the USB connector to go out the rear of the mic for a cleaner look. I also would have preferred a little less sound pickup from the rear of the mic. I sometimes forget to mute the mic when gaming until I notice that it's picking up my speakers.But those are minor things. This is a mic with plenty of bells and whistles for the price tag and it amps up the fun level if you ever need to voice chat.",

From using my last mic that didn\u2019t have a mute button, this one works great and I don\u2019t have to tap it hard at all for it to work.The only thing I don\u2019t like is the rgb light patterns, it\u2019d be cool if they were customizable or if you could pause them on a certain color (that\u2019d be awesome). And the solid colors are nice but I wish there were maybe a few more or just better shades of the current ones.For example, a purple color (rather than only a pinkish magenta) would be amazing, or a yellow that\u2019s actually more yellow than green.But I just don\u2019t use the rgb anymore on it though since they wont match anything else on my setup.",
