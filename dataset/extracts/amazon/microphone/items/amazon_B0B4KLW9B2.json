                "reviewText": "05/10/2023 Update: There appears to be an issue with the batteries. I'm trying to figure it out. Several times now I'm in the middle of meetings and people can't hear me - the microphone has turned off. When I recharge the LED stays amber or it goes off but then turns on amber and won't go off (I have to press the power button for a while until it shuts off). I'm discharging the batteries and doing full charges to see if that improves the situation. Three of my four microphones show this issue. After this \"reset\" two of the microphones have stayed on for 5+ hours. Sharing this tip in case you run into it, too. Dropped one star because of this issue.-----I have a good lavalier microphone and have been wanting to get a wireless for some time but kept giving it a second and third thought due to their high cost. I am very glad that I found this product.- The audio quality is really good - better than my wired lavalier!- For those who care about such things, my electromagnetic meter doesn't detect anything harmful while using it, so it appears safe to use.- I bought the two-pack. I only need one but wanted to have the second in case I ever do interviews. In the meantime, it's nice having an extra all charged and ready to go.- They connect super easy without needing any software or driver installs - just plug in the dongle and use. The connection is immediate - no issues at all.- I bought a second set to take with me to the office. I did a test and confirmed that each receiver can only pair with TWO transmitters at a time. The pairing is automatic. Whichever two microphones are turned on will be the only ones that can communicate with a given transmitter.- The battery seems to last a long time. I haven't had any issues at all, and after long meetings the battery meter still shows green (full / strong charge).- There's no weight to the microphones or receiver. You could read that as \"cheap plastic\" or \"feather light.\"- The only two minor annoyances are that (a) the clip is static (that does annoy me a bit, since I was used to putting on my lavalier with my left hand and now have to use my right hand ... like everything else, I'm sure this will go away with time), and (b) there's no mute / pause function that I've been able to figure out while using my PC.Great product at a great price. Definitely glad to give it a 5-star rating!",

                "reviewText": "I needed a wireless microphone for company meetings where we had a mix of local and remote participants.Some locations do not have the equipment needed to sufficiently share audio with the people on the conference call, as room placed mics do not pickup the presenter in cases where they move around the room. These microphones allow the presenter to move while presenting and still provide high quality audio for those who are on the conference call. The audio quality is very good and the battery life works for most meetings. If the meeting goes longer you can can quickly swap out the mics, since there are 2 included in this purchase.Easy to setup and connect to the presenters laptop and works really well.Overall, these are great wireless microphones that will work for multiple applications.",
