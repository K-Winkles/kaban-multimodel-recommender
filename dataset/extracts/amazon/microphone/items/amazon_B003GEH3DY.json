                "reviewText": "I have a large collection of musical equipment including professional microphones. I bought this Pyle table top condenser microphone to be used mainly to encourage my children to sing while playing the piano. It sounds great, rests nicely on the electronic piano, and has a lighted on/ogff switch that really makes it function very well. It eliminates the need for a large microphone stand with boom. Furthermore, this system replaced a professional large microphone that never sounded as well. It even picks up the voice unidirectionally from as far as 6-12\" with clear sound and without hum. I use a computer mouse pad to eliminate any thumping noises that may be transmitted from the keyboard, but this may not be necessary. I recommend it to any vocalist who plays keyboard because it can sit ontop of the keboard and is so small. It is probably much more suited to practice and home use than for live performances, but we may try it anyway. The sound quality, on/off switch, and low price make this a great and unique tool. It even comes with a decent 26.5 foot cable with XLR to 1/4 plug inputs and a with a (small) foam wind screen. I will look more closely at other products made by Pyle.as a result of this purchase.",

Of course the sound isn't as strong as from six inches away, but it still gets the job done wonderfully for the price. I read the reviews that said it drained the battery too quickly, so I bought a 9 volt adaptor and I've got something better than anything $200 could have bought me - at least for my needs. I love how heavy the base is (not too heavy, but plenty heavy enough to make sure it doesn't tip over on my slanted lectern).",

                "reviewText": "The Pyle Home PDMIKC5 Tabletop gooseneck mic is an excellent buy.The sound quality is very good, if not a little bit on the bright side - nothing to worry about. All other aspects of this mic are professional looking. It has a nice solid weighted base which prevents tip overs. The base encloses the 9 volt battery - Pyle could've made it to take 2 AA batteries instead, to cut battery costs down. But I have used this mic over 10 hours now and the battery is still going strong, so I am hoping that this continues for a while, cause 9 volt batteries aren't cheap.The weighted base has a power switch and the mic screws on to this base. The mic head and the gooseneck look very professional, and it has an led ring around the top of the gooseneck that lights up when the mic is turned on.If you are looking for desk mics, I recommend these over the highball mics on table stands, for both PA, conference or audio/video recording. May work well in a TV environment also.Because of the small head, the mic doesn't block the face of the speaker, as is often the case with the larger highball mics.Pickup pattern is cardiod, so you don't get much feedback in PA system use - but it is a little more sensitive than uni highball mics, so be aware of mic vs speaker placement in order to minimize feedback when using with a PA system.All in all a great value in a push to talk mic - I might just order another for when I mic forums or discussion groups, etc.DId I say this can work well as a video mic also? Great pick-up pattern with a nice clean sound.The integrated mini windscreen also helps to minimize popping and breath noise. Keep it at least 5 to 7 ins from the mouth when talking, and you'll get great sound.",

                "reviewText": "A bargained priced desktop or lecturn microphone ideal for meetings and public speaking. On unpacking, the base comes separate from the flexible gooseneck microphone which has a 3 pin XLR. It plugs into the base with an additional threaded collar to ensure a secure fit.A 9V battery fits inside the base which provides power to the microphone via an on / off switch on the base. I tested the microphone by removing the 9V battery, and plugging it into a mixer (using an XLR to XLR cable - purchased separately) which provides 48V phantom power. Interestingly, on phantom power, the on/ off circuitry is disabled and the button no longer illuminates, but the red LED ring around the microphone head is still illuminated, and the microphone sounds perfectly clear as running it on a 9V battery.In short, on 48V phantom power the microphone cannot be switched off at the switch on it's base, it is always on, but has the added advantage of not requiring the battery to be replaced every 8 hours, or running a separate DC power supply.",

                "reviewText": "I too was skeptical about the performance of such a low cost table top mic and pre-amp. However, in use with teleconferences, this combo mic/preamp works great!UPDATE: the mic failed just a bit after the warranty and Pyle didn't respond about replacing or repairing the mic - they responded offering an extended warranty for a review!One downside in some uses is the red LED lighting up near the mic tip. The foam mic cover cannot be pulled down over this LED.Pros: + 9V phantom power works on all podium mics tried + base actually works with other podium mics! + nice positive action on mic pre-amp button + good quality speech audio from pre-amp/mic combinationCons: - red LED just under mic tip can be a distraction in some uses - does not accept phantom power presented to XLR connector - because of above, must constantly check the battery - the base failed very soon after the warranty expired. The mic does function in AT8666 type podium base which is how it is being used now!Product changes required for broader use: * add a way to disable or mask the red LED under the mic tip * allow phantom power from the XLR connector to be passed through to the mic connector * add a low battery indicator",

Using them in a live sound environment in a medium-sized auditorium setting.Other pros: noise free switching, LED at base and on mic to show activity.Only con: not phantom powered, but seems to last quite awhile on the 9V battery",
