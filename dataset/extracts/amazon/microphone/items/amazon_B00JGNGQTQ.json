                "reviewText": "*** FINAL UPDATE *** Angela at Retevis was as good as her word. The replacement microphone works as well. It is not as clear as some, but far better than any others in the under $15 price range. This is a hot mic, and needs to be held at least 8 inches from your face. Audio quality is good. The strength of this mic is the way it feels in your hand... Perfect for desk or mobile use. Signal reports reflect good, strong audio, without a lot of background noise. Overall, a great deal for the money. I'm holding off on the 5th star pending further signal reports and testing. Overall, I like it a lot.My sincere appreciation goes out to Angela Lee and the team at Retevis. I have never had better customer service from any vendor. They bent over backwards to make this right.*** UPDATE *** I received a phone call from Angela Lee at Retevis. After discussing the problem, she will be sending me a replacement microphone at no cost. Angela was polite, courteous and helpful. What impressed me most was receiving an international phone call within hours of posting my review. It is hard to beat responsive customer service like that. For now, I am altering my review to three stars instead of one based on the great customer service. I will do a final revision once the replacement is received and tested.Hopefully, mine was just a bad example. Construction seems solid, although the clip is cheap and not likely to hold up under hard use. But it has almost no audio output on transmit. TX audio is about 25% of what it should be, and what there is is so muffled and distorted as to be useless for transmitting.Tested on Baofeng GT-3, UV-82, UV-5R%, and TYT MD-380 radios.No TX audio on any of the three.",

He could hear the calls coming in but couldn't respond. Every attempt failed when he was trying to call out. So don't waste your money on this one. Find something better that will last longer then a few weeks.UPDATE:The company reached out to me following my review. They stand behind their product and issued me a full refund in order to purchase another to replace the one that broke. Like I had stated my husband really liked their product. It's just our luck it broke after a few weeks. I will change my 1 star review to a 3 because the company made things right.",

Baefong / Ansoko 16 channel handhelds.I have approximately 30 handhelds in rotation.Pro - will fit a variety of 2 pin radios. - Fits well in hand and the Tx switch has a strong, solid feel - Clip is aggressive and rotates to allow for optimal placementCon - Your transmit absolutely cannot be understood. I've got a pretty good sense how most things in life work and my take is that the pick up microphone is obscured. Despite some passive access restriction features I plan to peak inside one of these and see if I can apply corrective modifications.Would I purchase these again? No. It is imperative that user be understood.Will most likely have to return these to distributor.Update to earlier. The microphone is most definitely obstructed. See photos. The socket for the microphone isn\u2019t located in the area of the sound slots and the slots are solid preventing the device from functioning correctly.That\u2019s that. Definitely a manufacturing error.",
