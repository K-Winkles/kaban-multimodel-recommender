                "reviewText": "I had a bumpboxx that I paid close to $500 for. I had it since 2020 & it could do almost everything (including karaoke) but it started acting up on the Bluetooth mode and then the speakers, so I desperately needed a replacement. I always listen to loud music, I love singing loud too and I needed something that was similar to my bumpboxx, affordable and maybe even better. I did research on different karaoke machines from Amazon , I looked at many reviews. I came across this system and my first thought was about how small it was and how loud it probably wouldn\u2019t go. I seen there was only 8 reviews but they was all good reviews so I decided to make a wish, take a chance, make a change and breakaway with my purchase\u2026 I don\u2019t regret it\u2026 It is so loud and clear, just marvelous, the mic was better than the one I had from a $500 purchase and the system lasted like 5 hours of me playing loud music and it still had juice when I was done\u2026 I was so impressed that I thought of buying another one and tbh with a promotion code of $40 off the original price you can\u2019t go wrong\u2026 I mean the system is worth 100 bucks so even without the promo code I probably would of bought another one regardless just because of my satisfaction. I would highly recommend if you\u2019re on a budget.",

This one is smaller and portable. The audio quality is crystal clear, making my voice sound professional and crisp during streams and recordings. I like all of the sound effects. The Bluetooth connectivity is seamless, and the long battery life is a game-changer. Like the other machines, I always appreciate how sturdy the microphone feels. It was incredibly easy to set up and integrate with my existing equipment. I\u2019ve used it for streaming and karaoke and haven\u2019t had any issues. Looking forward to see how it works for podcasts. If you\u2019re looking for a reliable, high-quality microphone for any audio-related activities, this is the one to go for!",
