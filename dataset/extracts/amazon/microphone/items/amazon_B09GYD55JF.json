                "reviewText": "I've been using the DJI Mic system, and it has revolutionized the way I record audio. The ease of use is the first thing that stands out. It's incredibly user-friendly, setting up in no time and beginning to record instantly once configured to do so. This feature is invaluable, as it ensures that I never miss a crucial audio moment in my recordings.The slim design of the microphones is a major plus. They are unobtrusive and can be attached without drawing unnecessary attention, which is essential in maintaining the visual aesthetics of any video production. Additionally, the ability to add a lav mic offers even more flexibility, catering to different recording situations.The battery life is another area where this system truly shines. It lasts incredibly long, reducing the need for frequent recharging and providing peace of mind during extended recording sessions. The option to record directly on both mics or use them for a stereo setup adds a layer of versatility that any audio professional or enthusiast would appreciate.Using these mics with my iPhone 15 Pro has been seamless. The direct compatibility with smartphones makes it a highly convenient tool for mobile content creators. The magnetic shirt attachment is a standout feature - it's strong, reliable, and coupled with the mic's lightweight design, it's easy to forget you're even wearing it.However, a couple of pieces of advice for new users: First, set the microphone to automatically start recording when taken out of the case. This ensures you're always ready to capture audio without any delay. Second, consider adjusting the light brightness in the settings. The lights on the mics, while useful, can be a bit distracting in videos, so dimming them can help maintain the focus on the subject.In conclusion, the DJI Mic system is an outstanding choice for anyone looking for an easy-to-use, versatile, and high-quality audio recording solution. Its user-friendly features, combined with excellent audio quality and compatibility with modern devices like the iPhone 15 Pro, make it an invaluable tool for both professional and amateur audio and video production.",

                "reviewText": "They are a little pricey, but it\u2019s very worth it. I have now gone through several different brands of Bluetooth mics and these are by far the clear winner. Clean sound, very natural voices, minimal background pick up, and none of that whispery white noise that I have experienced in some others. The magnetic clips are genius, and even if I clip it this way totally hidden under somebody\u2019s shirt and don\u2019t add a lav mic, the sound is great and doesn\u2019t pick up much clothing rustle. The controls are intuitive, and the fact that each mike is also a dedicated recorder is absolutely outstanding. Build quality is extremely pleasing, from the case to the units themselves. Battery holds a charge, basically forever, and charge quickly. Overall, this is an excellent set that anybody can just throw in their bag for content, interviews and more.",

                "reviewText": "This is a wonderful system. The little adapters for iPhone (lightening connector) and USB-C are great additions\u2026 as are the magnets that allow for clean placement of the mics. The touch screen on the receiver is nice but a little difficult to navigate at times. The sound quality is excellent. The biggest problem was finding the right lapel mic to pair with it. Most lapel mics bring \u201cnoise\u201d when plugged into these transmitters. After trying several\u2026 it seems the Shure MVL lavalier mic works the best with this unit. If that is the way you are going to use this mic\u2026 those lavs add another $70 each, so that adds $140 to your set up. The battery life seems to be a little shorter than stated in the listing\u2026 but I rarely push it to the limits, so that is not an issue for me. Overall, I love the DJI Mic. It\u2019s simple to use and brings great sound. I would definitely buy it again.",
