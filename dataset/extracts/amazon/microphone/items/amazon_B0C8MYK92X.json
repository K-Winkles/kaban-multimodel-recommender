                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Better in some ways, but not all",
                "reviewText": "This is better than my laptop/phone mic for meetings/calls, but not for videos, especially singing or other performances. There is a lot of distortion when recording loud sound like singing or musical instruments. But for casual talking it's much better than the laptop and phone microphones.Wireless is great, but I really wish it was Bluetooth. The adapter is a weird shape that blocks other USB ports on my laptop. It would be better if it were straight. It does come with two adapters that convert USBC to lightning and USBA, which is nice, but it's a lot to carry around. A better design would be to have a USBC plug on one end and lightning or USBA on the other end, to reduce or eliminate the need for additional adapters. Even better would be to use Bluetooth so that no adapter is needed at all. The range is still only about 30 ft even with their transceiver, so there's really no benefit over Bluetooth from any perspective.Also there is sometimes a lag in audio which can cause video and audio to become out of sync. It's not huge, maybe a quarter second, but it is absolutely visible and noticeable.Lastly, the case is awful. I almost would prefer no case at all. They give you a little pouch which is very hard to open with one hand, and not quite big enough to fit everything in it. They need to use a hard case like so many other similar products.Overall, I probably won't return it, but I can't recommend it either.",

One is a Motorola. Not sure what the problem is. I checked phone settings and every thing I could think of. On one phone both the receiver and mic LED would glow green, but nothing on the second phone. I had to return for a refund.",
