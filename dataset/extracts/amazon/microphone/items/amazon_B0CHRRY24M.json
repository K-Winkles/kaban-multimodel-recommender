I purchased this item because of the included articulating mount. Everything seems to be of good quality and the mic sounds good to me. I'm sure that I will upgrade at some point, but this was a cost effective starter set and has served its purpose well. This kit includes everything that you will need to get sound in to your computer.",

I (sadly) lost the instructions to build it but it was extremely easy to figure out, and it's very quick to move around as well. I do recommend that you have a solid surface to attach it to, cause you have to have it pretty tight (I especially recommend NOT attach to a glass desk), but otherwise it's practically perfect! My friend is even thinking about getting this same one and I'll make sure to let her know how wonderful it is.",

                "reviewText": "For the price, if you need a desktop or counter mounted microphone that does it's job. You won't regret buying this. The sound quality was a major improvement over my previous head set. And it can be used for gaming with some freedom of sound output, due to it focusing it's recording range towards you rather than a full 360 Degrees.One issue that I did have and could be an easy fix is the tightening bolts. Which makes the mount stay in place firmly. Specifically the flower shaped bolts that are found on the arm's base. it is difficult to tighten it with your fingers, due to it being shaped like a flower. if it were shaped like all the other tightening bolts, which are shaped like a proper handle, then it would be significantly easier to properly tighten so that the mount is not loose.If you used a grip wrench, you could tighten the base properly, however you could also damage the bolt handle at the same time.If these problems are not a concern to you, then you should still definitely buy this for casual high quality recording or even more professional recording if you are looking for a good deal.",
