                "reviewText": "I was honestly really happy that I had found a nice mini microphone for such a low price. I was so excited that I ordered 3 microphones. Though the product can work on IPads and phones, It would not work on my IPad, or my phone. I have tried many different techniques, and watched various tutorials but none of them ended up working. I also put my headphones in the little hole that was meant for them, but I couldn\u2019t hear any noise when listening to music or trying to record my audio. I thought maybe one of mine was defective, so I tried the others, but they also didn\u2019t work. I would have overall given it a five if it would have worked. I am disappointed, given that I had promised to give my friend one, but they don\u2019t do anything, so it would be worthless. I bought an adapter and two peachybbs slimes. All though the slimes were awesome, I couldn\u2019t get anything out of the microphone. The slime is still loud enough to pretend the microphone works, but not as loud as it would\u2019ve been if the microphone was working. Since I have mono and strep at the same time, this would going to be my entertainment, but I can\u2019t feel anything. I feel bad for giving a bad review, giving that I don\u2019t do this often, but I think a tip of advice is that you have to have an older version of the phone. If any of you guys reading this has any advice, I would love to hear it. I may be doing something wrong. If I am, please let me know! Have a great day!",
