The listing shows them as noise cancelling, not really though, they are just regular headphones/earbuds.I have a problem getting them to fit well in my ears, but I normally have this issue with other brands as well. The other brands tend to have different size cushion pieces to make them fit better but these do not.HUGE cord - this makes it very easy to move around instead of being tied directly in front of the computer or worrying about accidentally pulling the laptop off the desk if I forget and move away.The case is compact - very compact. It can be tough to get the cord wrapped up enough to push it all in the case, but it does fit. I just choose to not spend that much time and slide it in one of the laptop bag pouches instead.",

                "reviewText": "I liked that this set came with a very compact carrying case. However, the case was so compact that it does require you to actually really wind up the wire to make sure you can zip it up. I used this while I was traveling for work and wanted to take calls from the team room without needing everyone else to listen in on the call. My only other earphones were lightning cable earphones that could only be plugged into my phone (which couldn't be charged at the same time). This allowed me to listen to my calls, and music, without disturbing my teammates and charge my phone at the same time. The sound quality is basic, nothing super great to write home about, but perfectly adequate given the price. I didn't get any complaints about my microphone quality either so that was a win!The ability for the earbuds to stick to one another (magnetized) was a nice touch as I was able to put it down and not worry about the earbuds rolling all over the place. At one point, i even had it around my neck.",

                "reviewText": "I really was looking forward to these USB magnetic earbuds with mic and controls. I prefer the USB-A interface to the 3.5\" plugs as my computers use two versions requiring two pairs of headphones or an adapter. (1:2)When it arrived, it has a stylish and functional semi-hard storage case. The earbuds were neatly coiled and stayed attached thanks to the magnets. It does cut down on cable clutter and tangles.I tried it on my first system, a Windows 7 laptop and the earbuds were recognized and appropriate USB headphones driver was loaded.I tested the earbuds with Youtube video watching, and then played some familiar songs as well.The volume is sufficiently loud, and human speech was fine. But when listening to music. The sound quality and accuracy are poor and unacceptable. The frequency response had the upper highs and bass lows completely cut off. There was no bass at all. I tried to use a graphic equalizer to boost bass, and nothing happened. It was like listening to music on an old AM portable radio! I'm sure most were too young to know what I'm writing about! :)These earbuds are a disappointment. Their mediocre sound quality means they are only useful for privacy during VoIP or video meetings. The cable is more than long enough, and the built-in volume controls functioned as expected. But I can't recommend these if you enjoy listening to music as well.",

They are very comfortable and light weight.",
