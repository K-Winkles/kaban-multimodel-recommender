                "reviewText": "This is my second attempt at using a wireless USB microphone (the first was disappointing due to design intent product behavior).We used this primarily for outdoor group Zoom meetings with multiple people using the mic, where a laptop microphone or wired microphone wasn't going to work out. We have only used it as a USB input device for a windows computer, though I did test using the output jack to hook to a PA system once and that worked great too.On Windows10 and Windows7 it just worked - no driver download required. Not tried on other operating systems.Here are the good points:Distance - worked great in outdoor area where microphone was as far as 25 feet from the USB dongle (we did not try much further than that)Clarity - Even our softest spoken people were easy to hear on the Zoom call. No background noise at all - but if you point the mic at a gathering of people, that worked well for hearing them okay also.Battery Life - we used this 2 hours one day a week and two batteries has lasted for 10 weeks or more. Having a battery meter on the mic is great, so you can keep an eye on it.Durability - we have not broken it yet despite the occasional drop/throw. Feels very sturdy.Issues/suggestions.It would be nice if there was a mute button, but turning it on/off works fine.One time there was some interference, but it seems to be more about how the person was holding it, perhaps blocking signal to the USB adapter - once they adjusted it was fine.",

It really does a great job of keeping out the background noise. My daughter was using it right in front of the sound system speakers while something was playing and you could really only hear what she was saying and not the loud noise behind her. Got this to conduct for interviews for my music channel, and I have to say it exceeds expectations.",

And the box that it came in is perfect to move the entire system from place to place. What a great product!",

Tried another of similar price and in testing that one had a few issues. Was pleasantly surprised in testing and during our first event with this mic. Worked great. Connected from the back of the usb plug to our local speaker for voice support for folks in the room. For Zoom, the output was very high. Had to turn down Zoom output (audio settings) for mic but crank up the speaker to help balance the audio. Positive experience for the folks online and in the room. Simple solution!",

The people online for the meeting in \"TV land\" could hear the speaker very well. One thing to note though, when the speaker is holding the mic and moving their hands - the people online can not hear as well. Also, if people in the live-audience are clapping their hands, it takes away the sound of the person speaking in to the microphone - so save the applause to the end of the presentation. :) Other than that - this was a huge hit for our large team meetings :)",
