I plugged the connector part into the charging port, and it fit just fine with my otterbox case still on. The clipped the mic to my shirt and pressed the power button on the mic. It turned blinking green, then red, then solid green for the connection indicator. Then I just recorded as usual. Even though I have a great internal mic in my S22 Ultra, I have the camera mounted on a tripod about 2 or 3 feet away, and I have really tall ceilings that absolutely swallow the sound or make it sound more distant. This brings the audience closer with less strain. It was recommended by another video blogger as a must have, with the 2nd one great for interviews or 2 people chatting together. It was definitely a great purchase choice for my needs, affordable, and I love how easy it was to just connect and record.",
