                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great USB microphone for my needs, However GHub not so great!",
                "reviewText": "I bought this USB Yeti X specifically to be used in my Music Production Studio, in particular for my Arturia Vocoder V and Ableton Live. I think it\u2019s a great sounding microphone and the interface with headphones and Microphone levels is well thought out. I use it on a Boom Arm instead of the supplied desk stand. The only issue I\u2019ve had is not with the microphone but with the \u201cBuggy\u201d GHub Application.It would not install on my MacBook Pro M1 Chip but it did on my older iMac with a Intel Chip. After going back and forth with Logictec support here was how I had to install it in my MacBook Pro\u201cI would like to confirm if your Mac Book PRO has an M1 or Intel Chip. If your Mac Book PRO has an M1 chip. Please kindly try the troubleshooting steps below.Drag \"Logitech g hub installer\" into the default application folderin terminal: sudo /Applications/lghub_installer.app/Contents/MacOS/lghub_installer ; exit;hit enter and enter your password. It'll download and install. It'll look like it gets stuck at 99.894669, but give it a minute and it ill prompt you to finish and relaunch.\u201dSo I had to use Terminal on my MacBook Pro to finally get it to install.Now here is the other issue, some of the features in GHub work fine, like changing the Polarity or selecting the different Blue Voice Presets but the feature to Record your voice in order to reference how you sound does not work properly. I can get it to record my Voice ONCE, then it will not do it again. The only way is to quit GHub, launch it again and try to record again. But same issue I can only record my voice sample 1 time. It won\u2019t let me try to record a different voice sample after that Also none of the Ambient Sounds or Expressions in GHub play either. Logictec has been notified of the issue but has yet to resolve it. BTW, it is the same issue on my iMac so it\u2019s not the computer.In any event I still think it\u2019s a great microphone, nice quality, good sounding, easy USB Interface and the price was right. I hope the GHub issue gets resolved but it\u2019s not stopping my workflow.UPDATE 4.14.2023After several emails with Matt at Tech Support is was determined there was a problem and an Update to GHub would be done. Yesterday I received notification that the Update Version was available. I downloaded the Update and GHub is now working perfectly. One note, for some reason when I launched it my recorded voice sounded like an Alien. Anyway Matt mentioned to check the Effects settings and sure enough the an Effect was turned on. Once I set the Effects to off everything is working as it should. By the way if you record your voice for a long enough time (like 45 seconds or so) you can play it back and switch between hearing all of the Preset Mic Sounds and the Effects without having to re record or stop and start again. I have to say as much as the troubleshooting was annoying at times Matt and the Logitech Support Team did a great job.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent sound quality, but use of micro USB connector is odd",
                "reviewText": "I bought this as an upgrade to the Microsoft LifeChat LX-3000 that I have, specifically for use while working at home. This is a fantastic sounding microphone compared to Microsoft headset. Highly recommended to download the Logitech G Hub software as it has voice presets and allows you to customize the lighting of the display, as well as giving you fine-grained control of the sound and readout that you don't get otherwise. I wouldn't bother using the Blue Sherpa software, as the G Hub appears to give you everything in the Sherpa plus the color adjustments, and has a better UI. The Sherpa appears like legacy software.The mic and stand appear to be mostly metal. It's very solid and actually has quite a bit of weight to it.A minor gripe: One of the reasons I went with this mic is that it has a hardware mute button. Many mics don't, and are simply on all the time, forcing you to unplug them. However, when toggling the Yeti-X's mute button on/off during recording, it produces a very audible thump or clicking noise.Another issue with the mute button, is if you are not careful when you press it, you will inadvertently change the volume/gain. You won't know this using the built-in display on the mic, as it doesn't show the levels with any granularity. However, the G Hub software shows the level from 1 - 100, so it's easy to see. The gain display on the mic is not consistent, but one dot corresponds with about a 6 - 8 level adjustment in the G Hub software.The only odd thing, as mentioned in many reviews both here on Amazon and elsewhere on the web, is that the connection is the legacy micro USB port instead of USB-C, which is standard on most new devices. It makes no sense in 2020. However, that's a MINOR gripe and not worthy of a star deduction, as micro USB is a universal standard and replacement cords are easy to find. The people lamenting the fact that is has micro USB are being overly critical. I have many devices that are micro USB, and it's not going away anytime soon.Also, I haven't had any issues with the USB cord disconnecting. My guess is that's user error. The mic is supposed to sit vertical so I'm not sure how you manage to pull the cord out inadvertently.One thing to note, is that the mic with the stand is quite big. Bigger than I was expecting. On the included stand it sits about 11 and 1/4 inches high, and the base is about 4 and 1/2 inches wide, so be aware.I did buy a windscreen for it (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LXOJZJ9), but the mic sits far enough away from me that it's not really necessary. Plus the grille is pleasing to look at and it'd be a shame to cover it up. :)I'm glad I bought this when I did as it appears to be sold out in a lot of places.",

This solves that issue and the quality is top 3 for sure of any mic I have used over the years. The only Con which could be user error is the noise cancelation was not great I had a lot of background static / white noise. I resolved this with nvidia broadcast which is free.
