About as minimalist as a mic can get, the whole thing fits into a case the size of a USB thumb drive. Installing it is as easy as plugging it in to an available USB-A socket; any OS released since the George W. Bush Administration should automatically detect it and present it in its list of audio devices for recording, as did my macOS device.The mic presented itself to CoreAudio, where it was listed in Audio Midi Setup as \"USBAudio2.0\" with these specifications: Input 1 channel Format: 48,000Khz, 16-bit Integer and no outputs.Sound quality is acceptable for issuing Siri commands or giving dictation, or even recording a classroom lecture; however, I wouldn't use this to record a speech or -- heaven forbid -- a musical performance. It wasn't made or marketed for such uses where precise fidelity is critical. For casual uses as described, though, it is a good inexpensive, compact solution.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great little microphone device for the price. It was super easy to setup and worked right out of the gate on my W11 laptop. While the sound quality won't blow you away, it will do the job for taking notes on your laptop, etc. I was going to use this for song writing (scratch recordings, only), but I quickly decided that my laptop's built-in microphone was more practical. I don't think this microphone would be sensitive enough to use for anything other than rudimentary recording, but the price is dirt cheap and makes this a PERFECT tool for your audio toolbox.

                "reviewText": "After years of having iMacs with built-in microphones, I recently purchased a Mac Studio that lacks an internal microphone. The Samsung monitor I paired with the computer does have a mic, but it doesn't work well with Zoom or with Facetime calls. I strongly prefer not to use a headset in most situations.This microphone looks like a small flash drive, and plugs into a USB-A socket. The only thing that makes it distinguishable from a thumb drive is the circular group of holes around the microphone element. It appears as a \"USB PnP Sound Device,\" and configures readily in MacOS and Windows 10/11.The sound quality is quite good - it has excellent sensitivity, and people I have talked to say my audio is clear and crisp. It's a nondirectional microphone, so it may not work ideally in busy offices or public spaces.The device comes with a cute Altoids-sized black tin with a foam lining and a rubberized USB jack cover for transport.For my needs - occasional online chats and Facetime cellular calls, it is exactly what I was hoping for.",
