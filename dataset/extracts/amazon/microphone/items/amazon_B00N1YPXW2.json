Whether you are wanting it for work, gaming, streaming, or recording, it definitely gets the job done. One thing to note is that it is VERY sensitive and will catch even the quietest of sounds in a recording. I have been able to hear my neighbors through my headset, which was very shocking. If you're looking to get started with audio recording, I'd definitely recommend starting here!",

If you wanna start making music, making videos, recording podcasts, or just want a high quality microphone for zoom calls I recommend blue yeti's.My computer recognized it without any issues. If you plug headphones into it, you can hear your voice as you're recording. It's very helpful when making music. It has a dial with some settings, I use the one that records directly from the front. But if you were doing something like recording a podcast or video with other people you can have it record the entire room from all directions.Also the desk stand it comes with is really heavy and doesn't tip over, which is great when I accidently hit the decks and mic while recording.",

I did a comparison test - Yeti vs headphones mic to see how much of a difference it made and it was night and day. Good sound quality and little background noise picked up.I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who wants to do podcasts, voiceovers, etc.",

                "reviewText": "Well I suppose its about time to actually review this mic considering how long I've had it. I purchased this mic in 2016 and for the last 7 years it has yet to let me down. This mic taken an unhealthy amount of abuse flying off my desk more times than I can count (teenage gamer rage), and traveled with me throughout my life. Between gaming and work for those last 7 years I could estimate I've used this mic for roughly 18,000 hours and its still going strong. It can be a little finicky to set up correctly to reduce background noise, but if your using discord or the Logitech software this is a breeze. Not to mention the sound quality is surprisingly good with a small amount of tweaking. If I had one gripe about this product it would be the USB connection to the mic can be a little weak but I blame that on myself and my younger years.If you are considering purchasing this mic I highly recommend it. For the price of this mic the value is immeasurable.",

                "reviewText": "So, I got my hands on the Blue Yeti Mic a while ago, it's been great for my recording and streaming setup. The audio quality is mostly fantastic (has some slight feedback issues.) Whether I'm recording vocals, streaming games, or podcasting, this microphone delivers amazing sound that makes me feel like a pro.I love the fact that it's so easy to set up and use. It's a simple plug-and-play setup, so I didn't have to mess around with any complicated installations or extra equipment. Just plug it into my computer, and I'm good to go. Plus, the sleek and stylish blackout design adds to my setup.The Blue Yeti offers four different pickup patterns, which is a big plus. It's versatile enough to handle any situation. Whether I want to focus on my own voice, capture the whole room, conduct interviews, or even record in stereo, this microphone has got me covered.Now, there is one small thing worth mentioning. I did experience a bit of a feedback issue when using the microphone at higher volume levels. It's not a deal-breaker for me, but it would have been nice if the microphone handled those levels a bit better. It's something to keep in mind if you tend to crank up the volume.The microphone is a solid choice for anyone looking to up their recording or streaming game. The sound quality is great, and the flexibility of the pickup patterns is a huge plus. Just be mindful of the feedback at higher volume levels. That being said, I highly recommend giving this microphone a try!",

I can imagine this to be a great gift for anyone that is into gaming or podcasting or even works from home.I do want to share that the mic comes with a stand and so far is great for smaller desk spaces or even larger ones but it is wired as well.",

                "reviewText": "I knew this mic would be perfect for streaming and gaming because I have talked to numerous people who own/use Yeti Blue every day, and it is exactly what you want. Unless you are spending over $200. This mic is built properly, it's tough and weighty, it sounds amazing, and it's plug and use. A non-tech savvy grandmother could set this up. Pay the little extra and you're set.The only note I will make is that if you are using a mic arm (highly suggested, professional looking and if you bump your desk with the stock table-base setup, it will cause playback) So get a microphone arm and order the mic screw adapters (on amazon) by avatarr. 1cm thread, adaptable to 19mm which is the yeti thread size. I got a mic arm at a pawn ship for $30, lucky but don't spend over $50 on a mic arm unless you are rich and starved for time. They are cheaply made and easily found at pawn/music shops.Happy creating, have fun and take care. Also, spread love.",

                "reviewText": "Je n\u2019avais encore jamais eu de vrai microphone. J\u2019avais vu sur internet que beaucoup de vid\u00e9aste l\u2019utilisait et avait vu aussi beaucoup de gens en dire du n\u00e9gatif.Je me suis laiss\u00e9 tenter, et quel bonheur !Je l\u2019utilise surtout pour mes discussions tardives et en jeu et ils fonctionnent parfaitement.Les diff\u00e9rentes molettes ( volume, r\u00e9glage de l\u2019intensit\u00e9 et r\u00e9glages du mode de capture de son ) sont de tr\u00e8s bonnes qualit\u00e9s et sont les seuls \u00e9l\u00e9ments en plastique.Un d\u00e9faut, le micro capte tous les coups ( m\u00eame les moindres ) que l\u2019ont peut faire sans faire expr\u00e8s sur le bureau ou sur le pied du micro.Mais sinon RAS foncez si vous voulez une bonne qualit\u00e9 de son dans un budget raisonnable.",
