                "reviewText": "The device arrived on time and installed easily. I did need to swap my microphone in Settings, but that's easy. It took a bit of hunting around as the instructions are a bit sketchy, but it only took a few minutes to get it done. the microphone needed to be plugged into my PC, daisy chaining it off a USB port in a monitor didn't work. Now that all that is covered, it has an attractive look, seems to be built well, and functions just as a desktop microphone should. No one has trouble hearing me, and the mute button on the unit works well. I bought this unit because I had to raise my voice to be heard on the microphone built into my laptop. This fixed the issue.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this microphone in order to host hybrid in-person/online DnD sessions at my house. The first one we ordered was faulty and didn't work. The company was quick to send us a replacement, which we still use occasionally three years later.The setup was a little tricky and required us to change some settings on the microphone's digital software in order to actually pick up sound. I think we watched some YouTube videos to figure that out. Once we got it working though, it worked great. We would use it in our living room with 6-8 people and those online could hear us clearly with no feedback. My husband and I would also use it when playing games together online so that our microphones wouldn't echo each other. The mute button in the middle is also very convenient, making it easy to quickly mute yourself if there is a lot of background noise going on.It has held up over the years and I would definitely go with this if you're looking for a microphone on a budget. I've never used it for professional streaming, but I might go with a higher-quality option if that was my goal.",

                "reviewText": "I bought the first one a while back but never thought to really test it, I just assumed it was working as I was only sitting 2' from it. When I needed a second mic for a different PC I ordered another. The new one was an out of the box failure. It was recognized and lit up but didn't work at all, even on the PC that had my original mic on it. I decided then to test the other mic from about 2'. It was TERRIBLE, barely picking up my voice unless I was yelling. I'm actually upset with myself for not testing it earlier. I've been in so many Zoom calls and just assumed it was the far end having sound issues given that I'm running a gaming PC on a Gig fiber connection but lo and behold it was this awful mic causing clipping and attenuation issues. I returned the broken one but I'm stuck with the other one. I really liked the design so it's a shame but function over form is better in a crucial piece of hardware. I ordered a ZaxSounds to replace it and it is MUCH better for about the same price. I'm talking night and day. I've been working in video conferencing since there's been video conferencing and the rule is always audio is more important than video. Do yourself a favor and get the ZaxSounds.",
