It will help encourage me to continue my real reviews of products I've purchased.Likes: * Thrifty Price * Nice volume * Complete for VLOG * Dead cat works well well to cut out wind noise * Detailed instructions on how to mount microphone * Cables for both smartphone and camera hookup included * If you register within a month of your order your one year warranty is extended to two years total.Dislikes: * Microphone will not work with standard smartphone with case on. 9MM base to 3/5MM plug is blocked by phone case and will not fully insert to phone. At first I thought the microphone did not work and almost knocked off a star as I've had to cut my phone case in order use this microphone with my phone in its case.Yes I'd buy this again. You can tell I'm new to this dead cat thing as you can clearly see mine in the upper corner of my quick video review.Thank you for reading my review:Again Please give this review a thumbs up. It is real. I do answer questions if in comments. I've been on Amazon as a customer for over twenty years, and now a top 500 reviewer. I don't get compensated for my reviews.

                "reviewText": "This shotgun mic had some real high points that earned it a solid four stars from me. First off, the inclusion of two separate cables, one for cameras and one for smartphones, is a major win. No more fumbling around with adapters or searching for the right connector \u2013 it's all there in the box. Plus, the two stands \u2013 one large and one small \u2013 give you flexibility depending on your filming setup. Whether you're shooting a big production or a quick phone video, this mic has you covered.Now, onto the audio quality. Here's where things get a little tricky. My recordings with this mic sounded good, clear, and focused. But... I honestly couldn't tell a huge difference in audio quality compared to other similar mics I've used. Maybe it's just the nature of these shotgun mics, but I was hoping for a bit more of a noticeable improvement. Don't get me wrong, the audio is clean and usable, but I wasn't blown away by a night-and-day difference.Overall, this mic is a solid choice for its versatility and user-friendliness. The dual cables and stands are a huge convenience, and the audio quality is definitely good. However, if you're chasing that game-changing audio leap, you might want to keep exploring your options.Pros:Two connecting cables for both cameras and smartphonesTwo stands of different sizes for varied setupsClear and focused audioCons:Audio improvement compared to other mics wasn't significantFinal Verdict: 4 out of 5 stars \u2013 A versatile and user-friendly mic with good audio, but slightly underwhelming in terms of noticeable audio enhancement.I hope this review helps you decide if this shotgun mic is the right fit for your needs!",
