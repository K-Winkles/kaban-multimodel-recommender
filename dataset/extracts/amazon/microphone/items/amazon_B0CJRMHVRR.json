                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Nice quality",
                "reviewText": "PROS: Big 18650 batteries are cheap and easily swap able if you pick up some extras- we have several for use in our tactical flashlights. there should be no issues with battery life for the intended use (non-professional). Sound is great. No drop outs walking around a LARGE meeting area 25' x 75'. I tried to find some fault in the sound but its good. No interference from the other mic or other devices in the room. Build quality is good, to reveal the battery chamber there is a plastic lower cover that screws off which is kind of thin but the upper portion where you grip the mic is metal. These come with wind covers to keep a clean speech.CONS: Two negative things; 1) THere is no way to monitor the level of charge to the battery in the receiver. The mics themselves have indication of battery level but not the receiver. However, there is a micro USB charging port that I plugged a phone charger into during use! 2) The mics are round. They missed the hex shape in the design that would have kept these from rolling off the podium. There is a rubber like sleeve that slips over the mic for this purpose but its not custom fit...its loose and flops down when you lift the mic. Seems like an afterthought. It can be slipped up into the windscreen area to a snug fit, maybe that is what was intended.I have to say, PRIME is way more dependable than UPS in my experience. I asked that these be delivered by 4PM on a Saturday when Amazon was telling me Sunday delivery. And they showed up right on time. Very impressed. All these \"Guaranteed Deliveries\" I have had lately that don't make it on time have me in doubt. UPS hasn't been forthright about packages, claiming the package was lost after \"being out for delivery\" for two days, then miraculously showing up 2 hours late. (TIme sensitive package that was rushed / guaranteed) So maybe Amazon knows what it is doing with their own trucks.",

The mics feel nice in your hand and the quality was all i had expected and more. I really like that you can use them while they are charging. As soon as they arrived we wanted to check them out and were able to due to this feature. They charged quick and seem to hold charge really well. I am impressed with these and would recommend them.",
