And they worked so well, I got this set for my own use at home.They're easy to use and the sound quality is solid. Both microphones are usb C for charging, and charge in less than a couple of hours. The receiver just plugs into the bottom of your phone (they make ones for iphone and for usbC android phones). You press the button on the microphone and pair them with your phone through the normal Bluetooth process. Both microphones can work at the same time.We've used them for three hours in a row without running out of battery. I'm not sure how long it could last at maximum, but it's more than three hours.It's not a professional-grade set up, but you're not a professional YouTuber. These mics work easily and well, and they're going to make the sound quality on your videos a million times better. Five stars.",

                "reviewText": "If memes and Tik Tok are any indication, meeting with people remotely is a pretty common pain point in the modern distributed enterprise. It's worse than just \"your microphone is on mute\"- a common pattern with people working long hours and trying to juggle \"life on the side\" is switching from desktop to phone or tablet, and not getting the same sound quality on the mobile device, especially from the microphone. While the \"life on the side\" issue is another problem businesses need to address, this little device fixes the problem of mic quality while on the move.I admit I didn't realize these were a thing until I saw this on Amazon. I have taken a few calls now while walking around the neighborhood- far better than participating in a call while seated in a chair. This mic filters out loud sound perfectly- I walked by a landscape team blowing and vacuuming leaves, two honking cars, and a lot of traffic, with no \"can you mute your mic\" or other distractions (meeting with a boss so they would have said something if there was any issue with the sound quality).Here's hoping this mic gets me on my feet more, as I'm able to safely/reliably join work conversations away from my desk.",

                "reviewText": "I've tried a few of these microphone sets, and I think they are probably basically the same, but in a slightly different package. In any case, they work just fine. They tend to reject more background noise than your phone's built-in mic, and (as long as the foam windscreens are in place) also help reject wind noise when making videos outside. The audio quality isn't stellar, but it's good--and it can be a definite improvement, particularly if your phone is set up at a distance of several feet, since the microphones stay clipped right to your shirt or collar. So I think they are definitely worth the money and can be a useful part of your podcasting or YouTube toolkit. One thing to remember--you'll have to select \"external mic\" in your camera app, so if your built-in camera app doesn't provide that feature, try the free app \"Open Camera\" available on the Play Store for Android phones.",

When I saw this little microphone set, I thought it might make the audio quality a little bit more clear, but I didn't expect it to do such a great job. We conducted several different test interviews withou tthe microphone, with Only one, and with both. What A difference! The noise-cancelling seems to be pretty solid as well,though since it was not a windy day, we could only test that feature using a table fan. Nonetheless, there was very little detectable sound interruption when we played it back. Excellent product to meet our needs and a great value for the price!",
