            "Gradient RGB Symphony Lights: Cyclic and gradient RGB lights, in line with your live broadcast aesthetics. Bring you an immersive gaming experience and awaken all your senses. There's also a palpable sense of security, and when the COCONISE microphone is muted, the RGB lights go off to let you know you're working. Prevent accidents when you forget to mute your PC microphone for gaming.",
            "Practical and convenient function: It is equipped with a one-button mute touch sensor. When you want to close the microphone, you only need to touch it lightly to mute the sound, and the RGB light will go out to inform you that the microphone has been successfully closed. Equipped with a rotary control volume button at the bottom. There is a 3.5MM headphone jack in the middle, you can plug in the headphones to monitor your own voice in real-time and make adjustments in time when recording.",
            "Cardioid Polar Pattern: This microphone features a cardioid polar pattern that captures crisp, smooth, and clear sound in front of the microphone, reducing side pickup so it can focus on your voice. At the same time, it is equipped with a 25mm ultra-large capacitor diaphragm capsule, which can capture a wider range of audio with a sampling rate of up to 192kHz, and the pickup is delicate and noise-free.",
            "SOLID FIT: With a weighted carbon steel base, your big movements won't knock the mic down, even during intense gaming sessions. The detachable metal anti-splash screen is adopted. Compared with the sponge, the metal anti-splash screen can filter the plosive sound more effectively. And the rubber elastic band is firmly clamped on the shock mount, which can reduce the vibration noise caused by violent keyboard tapping and mouse clicking.",
            "Plug and Play:PC gaming microphone for streaming, compatible with PS4/PS4pro/PS5 desktop and laptop. You can quickly enter the game chat. The 180CM long detachable USB data cable can be extended from the back of the computer host to the main body of your gaming USB microphone without limitation."

                "reviewText": "Very easy to assemble, very easy plug and play. I use zoom so I went in, it recognized it right away, and I was able to test the sound right in zoom. It didn\u2019t sound tinny or anything, even without the pop filter. There\u2019s also a 36 month warranty if you email them with your order number. Also the lights are great, the gradient lighting is very pretty, pleasing to the eyes.Now, for the price you pay,$20, you are getting your moneys worth. It is a tiny bit flimsy, but if it\u2019s just sitting on your desk, and your streaming or gaming you should not have an issue. The mic screws into the base tight (be careful not to mis thread) and the wing nut to adjust the mic tightens good too.Warning, it does not come with an adapter. The plug I had needed an adapter for my MacBook. I\u2019m fairly certain it says it comes with one. So grab one on here. I grabbed 4, 2 males, 2 females on here for $5 on sale.Overall, super happy with my purchase and excited to start using it! If you\u2019re looking for affordable, and useful, I definitely recommend!",

I use it for recording podcasts, video calls, and voice overs, and it always delivers crisp and clear audio. The microphone has a cardioid polar pattern, which means it picks up sound from the front and rejects noise from the sides and back. This is great for reducing background noise and focusing on your voice. The microphone also has a mute button, a volume knob, and a headphone jack, which are very convenient features. The desk mount is sturdy and adjustable, and it clamps securely to any desk or table. The microphone can be tilted and rotated to find the best position for your voice. The usb cable is long enough to reach any computer or laptop, and it works with any software that supports usb audio devices. I highly recommend this desk mounted usb microphone to anyone who needs a professional sounding microphone for their home or office. It's worth every penny!",

                "reviewText": "Not what I expected at the price! I am so pleasantly surprised by this microphone. I originally used the stand that it comes with, which is good, but I am a bit clumsy and have multiple books and papers that I move around constantly and needed the space on my desk. I decided to get the mic arm to keep things sleek and avoid accidently bumping it. I run a weekly game of D&D with remote players, and they have commented on the \"sweet setup\" I have. The sound quality is fabulous, and everyone can hear me clearly. With the quick tap button, I can easily and quickly turn off the mic when I need to handle the day to day that my players do not need to hear and quickly jump back into the game without interruption. All around, I am satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone looking to get a great mic at a great price.",
