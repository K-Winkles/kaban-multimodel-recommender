RGB changes itself automatically but no button on the mic to change colors. If you want to turn off the RGB, you have to mute the mic by the mute button on the top of the mic. AmpliGame A8(ASIN:B09YLM3FNC) is a gaming mic with controllable RGB. How can I adjust the mic gain level? You can adjust the mic gain level only by the gain knob at the bottom of the mic, it doesn't work if you adjust the mic gain level in sound settings. Make sure you turn up the gain knob before you use the mic. What is the maximum thickness that the clamp can handle? The PC gaming microphone boom arm can mount tightly to the desk up to 2.1\u201d thick. Overly rounded or overhanging desktop edges do not make good mounting surfaces.Make sure the C-clamp are resting on the flat surfaces. Does it work with the Android phones or iPhone? We don't recommend using A6T mic with the phones because the phones may not supply sufficient power to the RGB light and the sound quality will be affected. If you have to try, please use a genuine data cable or adapter for connection.",

It picks up my voice very well, you can adjust the sound to make your voice louder or quieter, the mute button comes in handy, it doesn't pick up alot of background sound only a little bit, you can screw it into your desk, it moves really well when adjusting it, and the colors are cute! The only problem is that the mic sometimes drops to the side. I kept thinking that mabey I didn't screw in the mic properly but it's just flimsy. As long as you're not to aggressive with it then it'll be fine. Over all this product is amazing and I highly recommend!Side note-(it doesn't cut out when you scream)",

The rgb light on this mic was a let down since I was hoping it would be customizable. Still, the colors on this are bright and the gradient is pretty. Cheap boom arm but you get what you pay for. Very impressive for a 50$ microphone.",

I have been using the mic as my default to separate audio and have been very pleased. Clear sound, the pop filter works as expected. Fifine did an excellent job with the product. The boom arm that was included, while lower quality, does the job until I can invest in higher end products and I couldn't be happier.TLDR: nice mic, works very well after some fine tuning with gain and volumes. Very happy. Def worth a purchase.",
