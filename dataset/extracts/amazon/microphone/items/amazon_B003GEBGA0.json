                "reviewText": "I believe this is a hidden jewel of a microphone. Let me tell you, at under $10 I wasn't expecting much. I was expecting something plastic, something that feels as cheap as I expected it to sound. Well let me also tell you that this little guy's build quality AND sound is all but cheap.First off, the build quality. Wow is all I can say at $10. This microphone feels nearly as well made as the Shure SM58. It is slightly smaller (15%?), but everything feels the same... the casing, the grill. It's all high quality stuff. It feels VERY well in the hand, I could not believe it. This microphone feels and looks like a $50+ microphone. No, it's not a Shure SM58 but it's pretty darn close for costing a tenth the price.Next, the sound signature. I'd describe it as having a warm, bassy sound especially with proximity effect. The closer you get the more you sound like a radio show host. The proximity effect is definitely there and in my opinion is a good thing when combined with a windscreen. I'm running this guy to a nice preamp and let me tell you that although this is no condenser it does have great clarity. As I said this looks and feels like a $50+ microphone, it sounds like one too. I'd say the sound signature is definitely BETTER than the Blue Snowball USB mic.The included cable is okay quality, not the best. It is an XLR to 1/4. The cable itself is thick but the XLR connector is hard to remove. The 1/4 side has the problem of feeling cheap. But I mean what can you complain, it's $10 for a mic and cable. If I were to review the cable I would say 2/5, but 3/5 for the price.Let me warn you, however, that this microphone only achieves a good sound when hooked up to a preamp. You can \"get by\" by buying an XLR to 1/8 cable and hooking it to your laptop or whatever but trust me the sound signature will suffer from it. It is dramatically less clear and has less volume, bass, and overall presence when not amplified. It sounds \"like a $10 mic\" without an amplifier, believe me.Overall the Pyle-Pro PDMIC58 is an excellent microphone for the price. It's well built and sounds great when hooked up to a preamp. Would I recommend buying this guy without a preamp? Yes actually. It's enough to \"make ends meet\" at $10. But this guy actually shines when you also purchase a preamp to get this guy at a seriously nice signature. Band practice, karaoke, podcasting, Skype, whatever... this guy really does shine at $10.",

                "reviewText": "It's a $15 mic, so it's not really fair to compare it to a $100 mic, however there are a handful of other cheap mics in the $10-$20 range right here on amazon and I just happened to compare a bunch of them head to head. Let me preface this review by saying that mics will sound different under different circumstances, including the user, the use, the other equipment, and the location it's used in. My findings are my own voice, talking and singing through two different PA (Bose L1 compact and Yamaha Stagepas) systems in my own house.These are the mics I tried and compared:#5 Weymic W500https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DGBDF4C/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&psc=1My least favorite. Lighweight feel, too much high end, lots of handling noise. This mic also would not lock onto my XLR cable (manufacturing defect)#4 Weymic W501https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DGBUJU0/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0I prefer this to the W500 but it still feels lighweight, and has lots of handling noise but it does have a better low end. This mic also would not lock onto my XLR cable (manufacturing defect)#3 Pyle Pdmic58https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GEBGA0/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1This was the first mic I bought of the bunch and before I compared it to any others I was really impressed for the price. It has a lot of gain, too much high end and not enough bottom. Build is heavier than the previous 2 and handling noise is less.#2 Weymic W800https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CTOBDH8/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A2RIKQIMKURS0XThis mic has similar weight and handling noise to the Pyle, it actually seems to have more high end but also much more low end, it's a very dynamic mic. Like the previous 3, It's also a hot mic. It's very clear for speaking and a nice singing mic for the right singer/song combination. It's also the cheapest of the bunch, $10.50 at the time of this writing and honestly for the price it's an absolute bargain.#1 Behringher XM8500https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002KZAKS/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1This is my favorite of the bunch. Sometimes I would sing into one of the other mics which are all hotter and more trebly than this one and think they sounded better (more clear) but overall this mic just has much better midrange that gives your voice a lot more body. It's also the heaviest of the bunch, the least handling noise, and the most expensive at a whopping $19.99!All 5 of these mics can be made to sound very similar to one another with a simple 2 band eq but I couldn't get any of the mics to match the midrange of the Behringer. I'd bet with a 3 band or more you could really dial these all very close to one another. That being said much of your decision should be based on build quality, and handling noise in my opinion. For me the keepers are the Behringer and the W800. Between the two I like the W800 (with the treble dialed down a bit) for songs that call for a lower vocal range while still remaining clear, think Frank Sinatra & Elvis, also for speaking this mic has a great range and clarity. For rock songs (oasis, alice in chains, radiohead, GnR) I prefer the XM8500. If I could keep only one it would definitely be the Behringer.",
