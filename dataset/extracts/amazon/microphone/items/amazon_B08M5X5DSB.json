I use a noise cancelling adapter through Asus to suppress background noise, as my home environment is not quiet/ideal when working from home. Although I have a nice Blue-Yeti Microphone I use for gaming/streaming, I could not use the noise cancelling dongle with it. With working on a work PC, with extremely limited access to third party programs, using LG's noise cancelling software was not possible, so the solution for work required hardware that required no software support. I could have purchased an audio interface and converted the audio back into analog, but this would have been expensive in comparison, not to mention converting a signal from Analog-->Digital-->Analog-->Digital would have most assuredly caused poor quality. for $20, this worked with my existing hardware, sound quality is fine, and it was plug and play. Can't ask for more.",

                "reviewText": "TL;DR - a complete waste of both your money AND your time! Poor connectivity, poor quality, poor sensitivity, poor documentation, bad deal all around.Details: There are so many things wrong with this microphone that it takes a while even to enumerate them. The sound quality is clearly inferior to the iPhone 6's built-in one. The set-up is very complicated and the manual is completely unhelpful. The advertised iPhone connectivity is a lie: modern iPhones do not support a wired 3.5mm connection, while this microphone does not connect to the older ones. After wasting money and time researching and buying adapters, I gave up on LOOYUAN's promised iPhone connection. The only device to which I managed to connect this, ahem, \"product,\" was a laptop (the process was also not intuitive by any means) but then the sound volume and quality was terrible. I had to practically bite the microphone to get any competent response to my voice. Then there is also an annoying background ping (I first assumed this was somehow related to the location, but then I tested it out at several others and the ping remained). This very audible ping was as loud as my own voice.Conclusion: It is baffling how this microphone ended up with 4-star reviews. Amazon Basics has a much better and more serviceable microphone that costs only 10 dollars more. LOOYUAN needs to be paying you to buy this. Unless you have nothing to do with 30 dollars and half a day of your time and enjoy frustration, please do yourself a favor and NOT buy this, ahem, ... \"microphone.\"",

It's also doing a solid job at not picking up the sound of my walking pad that's under my desk, which is super important as I like to walk during meetings sometimes. It also just does a great job picking up my voice clearly when I'm in meetings, so I never sound distorted and I'm not relying on the crappy built-in mic in my webcam. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking to try out an external mic!",

                "reviewText": "I have been using this microphone for almost a year now, the overall quality is not half bad for how cheap and simple it is made. I have not ran into any of the issues other people have claimed to have with this microphone yet, the only thing that I have noticed is when I plug into a new windows device I have to manually set the output volume to max because in windows its only set to like 20%, I also have to adjust the DB Volume a bit to better pick up my voice but that does not bother me as I only have to do that when I plug it into a new device it's not been plugged into before. I have had no one complain about how quiet I sound when using this microphone which is one thing my headset had an issue with, and no one has complained about it sounding like low quality either. The other complaint I have about this microphone is the cable length, when it was on the stand it came with and Infront of me the cable was not nearly long enough to go past my 2 monitors and into the back of my pc, the splitter also had 1 cable end that was slightly longer than the other end so when using 2 splitters just to extend the cable it was not as long as it could be, even with the 2 extensions I ended up making my own extension cable for the microphone just so I could use it with my boom arm as that will take away at least half the cable. Other than those few things it's been reliable for me I have not had any additional issues throughout the year, and I would recommend it to someone who needs a cheaper mic just to start out with.",

Compared to my 48v mic, the volume seems a bit weak, but it is not my primary recording mic. I bought this one to use for my podcast guest mic as an inexpensive start up option. The pop filter is great also. My podcast kit did not come with a pop filter, so I got a second one separately in the boom kit. I'm going to give it a good workout in November when I record five episodes in one day in a five episode series for You Tube. I'm hoping for the best.",

All other mics had a usb connection or a usb+3.5mm that you had to connect through the mic headphone jack, which created a frequency hiss. This one worked with no issues. Sound is good. Background sound is minimal for a condenser mic. Still looking for something higher quality, but if you want it for online use it is a very good mic. Plus you have no other options except lapel mics.",
