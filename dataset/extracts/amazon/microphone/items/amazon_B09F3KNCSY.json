I have to admit, for the money you pay for this is a great quality microphone! Super easy. Just plug in and play! I've done a couple of recordings now and the sound quality is great! I will say it picks up everything in a room so definitely be mindful of noise around you. The stand is awesome. Heavy duty and sturdy! The headphones are decent but work awesomely! Better than expected!!! I've recommended this to a few of my friends who are trainers as well to see what they think so definitely worth the price!!",

                "reviewText": "Tldr: A great budget option as long as you're not looking for something extremely professional.--I usually keep the microphone about a feet away from me due to how my desk is situated, and it still picks up my voice without too many problems. I only use it for the occasional Discord or Zoom call though, and maybe a Twitch stream here or there, I can't say if it's good for gaming or recording.Some breakdowns:Quality: You can hear yourself just fine, but it's not like super crisp quality or anything. Just slightly above average good enough to use type.Background noises: I do not hear any keyboard or mouse click noises from the mic, so this is pretty decent. If you like bang the table or something it'll still pick up a bit though.Multiple voices: It definitely picks up voices very well. I have a noisier house and it would pick up other people's voices as long as they're in the vicinity.Music: It might not pick up music too well, I tried playing some music off my phone and it took a bit before it adjusted to pick up the music & even then it was def at a lower volume than my voice even though I literally placed my phone right in front of it. This doesn't really say much if ur playing live instruments though cuz I can't test that.",
