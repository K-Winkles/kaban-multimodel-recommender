                "reviewText": "These mics are such great quality for the price.I am a radio and television professional, and these make content creation easier and better soundthan one would expect in a small device that is bluetooth.I really appreciate the different types of pop filters, one smooth for indoor use, and one furry for outdoors. The wind noise is greatly reduced, although it is difficult to put the furry ones on the mic head, as it is a tight fit.The dual mics are perfect for live video for two subjects on camera. The duo I ordered is my second, because I got a new phone with a USB C, as opposed to the lightening port.The plugin transmitter is a little bulky sticking out the end, but it is only a real problem when used with a gimble camera stand/wand.Overall, good product, helpful in creating content, and worth the money.",

                "reviewText": "The SUMMARY:It is a perfectly fine mic for casual use, and the noise cancellation is better than my other lapel mic, but I noticed that the mic would always make a crackling noise for the first few seconds of recording sound. It would be mostly fine after that, but the crackling sound would happen again at the beginning of any video with sound or sound recording.I tested it with both mics and the crackling noise would happen every time with either mic.If that's something that will bother you, maybe it makes more sense to spend an extra couple of dollars on a better quality mic.The PROS:** Noise cancellation is VERY good.** The mics charge very fast.** Easy to use.** Decent price.** Extra USB-C to lightning adapter.The CONS:** Crackling noise at the beginning of each sound recording (i.e., if you are recording a video, there won't be any crackling until you start speaking or sound actually is perceived by the mic, then the crackling starts for a few seconds and then stops).** For a couple dollars more, you can get better quality.",

I was looking for an eternity for wireless lapel microphones that were a good deal, sounded great, & connected to USB c so I could easily get a usbc to usb adapter to use them for my computer-Then I found these !Genuinely was taken aback from how good they sound lol. At the time I bought them, they were $9.99 I\u2019m pretty sure? So if it\u2019s any higher than that + tax, I didn\u2019t pay it but probably would pay the new price if it came down to it. Great purchase :) 5/5 stars tbh",

So if you want to get them, I would advise you to get them because they come with the adapter that also goes into the old versions of the iPhone 13,14 and below.",
