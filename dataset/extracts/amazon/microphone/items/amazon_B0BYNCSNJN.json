                "reviewText": "These microphones are great. They are very simple to use and set up. The carrying case they come in is perfect for transporting them around. I tested the range and it was still picking up my voice from pretty far away. I was impressed. The sound quality is pretty good for the price, but can't compete with the more expensive microphones. We got these so that our daughter could interview her grandparents and they worked perfectly. If you need to hide the microphone, it's kind of tough but not impossible, as they are a bit on the larger size. Overall, I would definitely recommend these for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I love using new tech, but sometimes I really hate learning how it works. I didn't even need to read the directions to get this microphone working. I opened up the box and the pieces were intuitive. All you need to do is plug the lightning connector to your phone or iPad and then turn on the microphone by flipping a switch. I had it working in 30 seconds. Other microphones require more work. I have another brand that was purchased by my employer and it's awful!This microphone also has some nice features: The lightning connector has a place where you can plug in a lightning cable if you need to charge your phone or iPad. The charging cable that comes with the set can charge the case and a microphone at the same time. There are two microphones!I'm a middle school teacher, and I often made videos for students about science content to help them if they are absent. This microphone is perfect for my needs. It will also work well for Zoom meetings. I made a few videos using it and the sound quality is great. I really couldn't be happier.",

And, even better, it includes not one, but two mics \u2013 perfect for those in-the-field interviews!",

It connected to my phone quickly and the audio on this unit is very good. For the most part it picked up sound even when my head was turned away from the microphone. For his reason I really liked the product and normally would recommend it. Recently, I started to notice some problems (about 6 months after purchase). Intermittently, the microphone would stop connecting. I shot a few of my YouTube video segments not having sound and had to re-shoot them - Very frustrating! The piece that fits into the phone would have trouble connecting to the microphone and not transmitting to the phone. I would wiggle the piece that goes into the phone and the connection would intermittently go on & off. This was indicated by the little blue light on the phone connection turning on and off. Now, it will not connect at all with the microphone. I was pleased with how this microphone worked for the price, but the durability and longevity of it was very disappointing.",
