                "reviewText": "I ordered this for a friends twin daughters. To be sure it was ready to go I charged it and tested the functionality. It connected to BT seamlessly, the built-in audio quality was exceptional on the mic considering the cost and the build quality was also impressive for the price.My friends girls have been playing with it non-stop for day's now, even Mom and Dad are enjoying it. Anyway, my 16 y/o daughter wanted one for her TikTok stuff so I foolishly ordered another brand that looked very similar thinking they were all the same. Bad move, JUNK, sound is awful, barely amplified, defective BT and the lights only worked in one mode. A return has already been initiated, the two are not created equally.Sooooo, if you are looking for a GREAT karaoke mic, latest version BT, great sound, lights, etc.....look no further, this is the best mic for the $$$$$ right now. Very impressive especially when compared to another that was highly rated and looked much the same. Trust me, just buy this one, no need to spend $30-$40 on the other more popular brands, this one is perfect for the price.....hopefully they will hold up long term, i'll report back once we've had it for a few months. Bottom line is it's still a child's toy but what a fun toy it is and for the price you just can't beat what it can do and how it performs.",

                "reviewText": "My girls are obsessed and they use it all the time. I love that the songs are preloaded and easy to use. There are a few things that are important to know.First, would I buy it again? Yes, BUT, when you turn it on it auto turns on at the loudest setting, even if it was turned off at the lower setting. It also has a few incorrect words including the wheels on the bus song it says \"the wheels on the bus go round and drowned\", over and over and drowned is very pronounced (louder and more forceful than the rest of the song) which sounds morbid when you are listening to it. My girls think it is funny and we talked about it, BUT it isn't ideal in the least and I would look for another one if I felt confident that another would work as well but have the words correctly, even for a higher price. We had tried a different brand and had to return it twice because one wouldn't charge, and the other would randomly turn off after a minute or two. So for the price it is a good option.Lastly, it isn't the sturdiest of toys. Considering it is made for little ones, my 5 year old accidentally dropped it on our rug and the microphone top popped off. I hot glued it back together and it still works, but I was surprised at how easily it broke.All in all, for the price it's what we wanted. The microphone works well, the songs are preloaded and it holds a charge.",
