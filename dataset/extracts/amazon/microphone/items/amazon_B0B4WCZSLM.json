            "1 Receiver with 2 Transmitters: This mini wireless lavalier microphone kit has 1 receiver and 2 transmitters included, which makes it possible to record sound or video from both 2 parties at the same time. Also, you can use just one mic alone for interviewing, vlogging,live streaming, podcasting or online meeting",
            "360\u00b0 Rotatable Clip: Different from others, we have updated the microphone clips with 360 degree rotation feature, which means that you can change to any direction you want while you\u2019re making recordings. More importantly, the microphone\u2019s clip can be largely protected from being broken easily, because you don\u2019t have to take it off your microphone before changing directions",
            "Real Time Monitoring: Equipped with monitoring system, you can monitor the recordings while they are being made by inserting USB-C earphones to the interface of the microphone. In this way, you can clearly know what content will be recorded by the microphone and make necessary adjustment to make your recordings more accurate",
            "Easy Connection, Plug & Play: The smart clip-on microphone is much easier to use than other microphones. Just get the receiver to your devices and turn on the power switch of the transmitters, the two parts will get connected successfully and auto paired immediately. Then you can start to record voice or videos without opening extra app or bluetooth in your cellphone",
            "Smart Wireless System & Hands-Free: The cordless lav mic is inserted with bluetooth technology that allows you no longer to be restricted to the length of the wire while recording. You can just clip the microphone on your shirt to free your hand and recording at a remote distance. Without messy wire, it will be very convenient for you to record on different social media platforms like Youtube, Tiktok and etc.",
            "Omnidirectional Sound & Noise Cancellation: This portable lapel mic is equipped with little spray-proof sponge foam and high sensitive microphone, which can pick up sounds from all directions and offer you clear recordings. Besides, with innovative noise reduction technology, noise is blocked from your surrounding environment to ensure you a quality sound and better experience",
            "Compatible with iOS Devices: The small upgraded lapel mic is compatible with iOS system and can be use with iPhone and iPad. Without usb c type interface connected to your mobile phone, it can not be used with android devices"

I\u2019m so glad I found this mic pack. It works well and is so easy to use. The wireless connection is a huge plus! Other mics require batteries that I went through so fast, but this set is rechargeable through a cable (and having a second mic as a backup is great if the first one needs to charge). The voice quality is good, but I\u2019m actually more impressed by the noise cancellation! My job has phones ringing, conversations happening, and music playing when I use the mic, and none of these have been picked up by the mic yet! For one of the cheaper sets available for purchase, you really can\u2019t go wrong with this one!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The Vid is using the mic clipped on my chest and receiver is plugged into iPhone 13 Pro Max. It sounds pretty good and as a YouTuber and Professional Content Creator I wanted a small, fast and easy external mic for the YouTube Shorts and the occasional vids shot spur of the moment on the iPhone. Stupid easy to use, quick and the sound is pretty good but I would add a little compression and depth in post editing. The insane part is in this little video I just shot so I could check it out as soon as it arrived, there is a Bluetooth speaker in kitchen rocking out and the TV in the room I\u2019m standing in was on. It completely cut out both and all you hear is ME!! Just before I put the mic on I made video with just the iPhone internal mic to be able to compare and you can hear the TV and the music playing in the background very much\u2026. almost overwhelming my voice! For the crazy cheap price, what a great purchase!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND this. Yeah, you could drop $300 and run a Rode GoMic || but have fun with setting up dongle and supporting the receiver connected to iPhone with mounting bracket and tripod. To get the simple, easy and fast iPhone shots, this is by far the way to go.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using the PGDLOF Wireless Lavalier Lapel Microphone for a while now, and I must say, it\u2019s been a game changer. The freedom of movement without any cords is liberating, and the absence of cord shortages is a huge plus.The microphones work exceptionally well. The sound quality is more than just acceptable; it\u2019s impressive. I\u2019ve even used them to record songs and play around on the Rapchat app. The audio clarity has added a professional touch to my tracks.One of the highlights was doing an unboxing video with these mics. The excitement of unboxing was matched by the performance of these mics. I\u2019ve been using them ever since that day, and they haven\u2019t let me down.In conclusion, the PGDLOF Wireless Lavalier Lapel Microphone is a fantastic product. It\u2019s reliable, delivers great sound, and offers the convenience of being wireless. I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a professional-grade lapel microphone.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these for my dad to use for his channel that he's starting, and after one test, I can tell you that for $20, this is a good pair of mics. Between the easy setup and installation, this would be the perfect easy beginner set for someone who isn't quite sure about mics or if they'll use them.All I did was connect the adapter to my phone, turn on one of the fully charged mics, and brought it out to his shop where he has possibly one of the loudest dehumidifiers known to man, and recorded with a testing video. Even with me speaking loud, absolutely no background noise! The only problem is these sound muffled, but not too muffled. You can still make out what someone is saying.One last final thing is when editing your clips, you may do better with audio separated from your phone and mic, so I suggest buying/downloading a recorder that has multiple tracks on it. No software is required, but I do suggest it for someone who is trying to make professional videos :)",

It creates a crisper, cleaner, louder sound than if I were to just record using my iPhone mic. I didn\u2019t want to fully commit to the price of a full studio microphone set up quite yet, and this was honestly the perfect in between step for me. Super easy to set up and use and I appreciate the fact that it comes with 2 microphones and clips. 5 stars!",
