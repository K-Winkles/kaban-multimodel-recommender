This solved the issues with my previous one which is its ability to hold the same position and have more range of motion. This thing is super good at both of those, I can now have it positioned perfectly towards my mouth to get a way better pick up than previously. In addition having the two articulating points makes swinging it out of the way when not in use a ease. This is a low profile arm but still allows you to have your mouse arm under it without hitting it as I do with my setup. It has built in tool less cable management that I love a lot. Only minor critique I have is where it slots into the clamp could be bit more tight in tolerance as it has some wiggle room but since its solid no way is your mic going anywhere.Summary:Large range of motion+Sturdy+Low profile+Price point+Built in cable management+Includes adapters for assortment of mics+Some wiggle at base-",

                "reviewText": "I don't usually write reviews unless something is extraordinarily terrible or extraordinarily great. And this is the latter. I'm not exaggerating when I say that this has significantly improved my desk setup. I was initially hesitant about the range of motion of this compared to my old mic clamp since it seemed so low, but this can reach the same height as my old one without forcing me to rearrange everything on my desk.The arm is smooth and flexible when moving, but also sturdy enough to hold my mic up without drooping. I cannot stress how rare that is to find. The low profile arm is low enough to pass under my monitor but also long enough so that it doesn't hit my monitor when I'm elevating it, and it's also simple to tuck away when I'm not using it. Whoever designed this has simply thought of everything. Cable management is clean. I'd recommend this to anyone who has a dual monitor setup, or heck, even a single monitor setup.",

                "reviewText": "I got this because I bought a fifine microphone (which I love) so I thought why not get the arm sold by the same brand, that makes sense, right? But I wish I had spent a little more money to get one that was higher quality. That said, it has served me well and is not a bad product for the price. It is very sturdy/secure/stable, but it's not as adjustable as I would like (I had never used a microphone before so I didn't know what to look for). I ended up just not tightening certain parts all the way so that I can rotate it (horizontally), which you can't do if you tighten it like you should. The distance adjustment (the hinges on the arm that bend vertically) are good enough for me, although getting the height and distance right at the same time is pretty finnicky (other reviewers have explained that better, idk). All-in-all, it was good for me at the time, but I plan to replace it soon now that I have a better idea of the range-of-motion I need. Unfortunately, the next one I buy will not be at the amazing price of only $19.",

I love that the handle on the C-Clamp can be rotated without tightening, giving you more options to mount it.The low-profile design of the BM88 stays out of your way, giving you more space on your desk. This can be moved 360 degrees around and adjusted upwards up to 29 inches. My favorite feature is the cable management built into the mount, which makes your setup look neater and more aesthetically pleasing.This is the best boom arm I have found, and I love the look and feel of it.",

Let's check the mic:Pros:Low Profile Look: Stays close to your desk, saving space and maintaining a clean aesthetic.Smooth Operator: Adjustable arms glide effortlessly for precise mic positioning.Cable Concealer: Built-in channels keep your cables hidden, avoiding tangles and messy wires.Strong & Steady: Sturdy metal construction holds your microphone securely, without wobbles.Cons:Reach Restriction: Limited arm extension might not be ideal for everyone's setup.Clamp Clunk: Some users report the desk clamp feeling a bit flimsy or challenging to secure tightly.Threadbare Threads: Standard 3/8\" adapter might not fit all microphones, requiring additional purchases.Pricey for Basic: While functional, the price might feel steep for a basic boom arm compared to some competitors.Verdict:The FIFINE boom arm offers a space-saving and stylish solution for microphone positioning. Its smooth adjustments and cable management are great, but consider the limited reach, potential clamp issues, and adapter needs before dropping the mic (money).In short:Get it if: You prioritize a low-profile, cable-free setup and don't mind a basic, compact arm.Skip it if: You need maximum reach, have a non-standard mic thread, or prefer a more robust and feature-rich arm.",
