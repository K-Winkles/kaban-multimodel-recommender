Works well both on Android Samsung Flip 4 and Macbook Air. Just remember that for Mac OS, you will need to change input of the sound under \"settings\" to USBAudio 1.0The quality of the sound is good for a quiet background, will still hear some background noise if it is too noisy. Nonetheless, the mic works well for its intent, I do recording of stories for my little one on my phone as I do MYO cards to play on her Yoto player.",

                "reviewText": "These mics sound great. I tested them out quite a bit to see how they function. Here's what I've learned while using them with my GoPro Hero 10 with the Media Mod installed.Cons:1. The audio plug causes the dongle for these mics to stick out of the back of the mic and it feels like it might break off one day.Pros:1. I tried using the picture on the listing to see how to attach it to my GoPro, and it says to use the included adapter. I did that and the audio doesn't work. (Just static.) That's a great thing because you don't have to use the adapter, which means the risk of breaking it off the expensive media mod is lessened.2. I placed one mic in one room, and the other mic in the other room, then I whispered into the GoPro Media Mod mic, and nothing came through. (That's expected. So, any table noise or whatnot from where the camera is placed, won't be an issue.) I whispered into each mic separately, and each mic worked just fine. (You could keep one mic shut off and just use a single mic as well, but both mics do work at the same time.)3. To use these mics, all you need to do is turn them on and plug it into your device. No wifi/bluetooth/special keypresses. Just turn them on, plug it in, and they work.Overall, I'm impressed with this mic setup, and I'll be using it for my YouTube channel.",

It also has a lag, so if you're trying to sing along with a song, forget it. In a quiet area, it does a great job. It pairs fast and has a good, clean sound.",
