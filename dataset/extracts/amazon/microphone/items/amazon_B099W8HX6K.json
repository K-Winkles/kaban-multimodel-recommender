And extremely easy to use.When I first received it, I was having trouble with the receiver, working without being plugged in. I messaged Customer Service about my problem, and they immediately replaced it. Now everything works excellently!",

                "reviewText": "These microphones are the real deal! Shortly after receiving we had a large outdoor party with over 100 guests. We each had a microphone and we were able to work our way throughout the crowd and no matter where we were the sound was clear and perfect and the signal was strong!! Everyone marveled at how much fun it was to be able to interact with us on the microphones with such clarity and professional sound. The battery life is exceptional. This would be great for large or small gatherings inside or out and perfect for a wedding or large public event. We will be using a lot for parties and fund raisers in the future and excited to use for karaoke. Don't wait, RUN and get your own pair of these microphones and for the price it is a 100% win!!! Enjoy and have fun\ud83e\udd70",

You hear almost no static feedback at all, are able to hear very clearly and has great battery life. They stopped working out of blue about a month ago so I contacted their customer service and got a new set pretty quickly which was great! Needless to say, I highly recommend these microphones to anyone that wants a nice clear sound for hours of fun!",

This arrived quickly and was so easy to set up. I was ready to go in under 15 mins. The sound was clear and no cracking noises. Mics stayed paired through Bluetooth and 2 mics made it easy for the moderator to be ready for questions without passing the mic back and forth.I expect to use this set for quite a while in the future.Great packaging and easy to understand directions. 5 stars!",
