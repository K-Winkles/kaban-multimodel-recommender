                "reviewText": "This REALLY inexpensive desktop mic ($34.95!) has the features THIS \"Oldster\" needs and appreciates. The clarity is about as good as it gets, with the mid-tones not being as mushy or tinny as quite a few mics under $50 sometimes sound, IMHO. And I like that it comes in its desktop stand, but also a separate piece for attaching to a boom_ VERY nice touch! :-) Oh, and the mic is suspended with a 4-point shock-cord system!If ya enjoy light shows, this thing has all the primary colors to choose plus some extra, some solid in color while others having a graduation from top-to-bottom two-color effect. You can choose from solid to a sort of pulsing, have it going from color-to-color, OR simply turn it off, and it is VERY simple with the touch of the button!The 'pattern' is very noticeable. When recording wile slowly turning the mic to talk at all the angles, there is a VERY noticeable drop when turning to the back of the mic. The side rejection, while not as significant as the back, is still very good!This is not a mic well suited for table use regarding several people having a meeting around the table. This mic is primarily used for being about 6-to-12 inches from the face. I would think the PERFECT use would be to have each person with this mic in from of their mouths, mounted on a boom arm... VERY directional.The noise-cancelling is really good. I had a loud radio program talk show, easily picked up by the mic, about 14 feet away, with the speaker at about a 45\u00b0 angle to my front-left. While the radio's audio was not 100% reduced when noise-cancelling enabled, it was VERY much reduced.The ONLY 'con' I have is the large gain control knob at the bottom. It is extremely easy to turn, so you can accidentally nudge it while say moving it around the desk. When I get a chance, I might just put a piece of tape over the knob at the max setting to keep that from happing... I'm lazy, and have no use for the gain being less than max on the mic. And the pop-screen is a nice touch.If you are looking to get a very affordable desk-top microphone with a great sound result, for use directly in front of the face, I really can't think why THIS one shouldn't suit the need.",

I use a cymbal stand from my drumset with a 3d printed adapter.",
