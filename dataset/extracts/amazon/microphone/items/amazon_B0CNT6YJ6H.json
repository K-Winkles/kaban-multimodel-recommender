                "reviewText": "I ordered the one with 2 mics. Upon Getting the package I was surprised as to how small it all was, however the sound quality is very good and it is very loud for its size. Alot louder than you would expect! The mics have a decent quality and they have an \"echo effect\" that can't be turned off. The mics settings aren't seperate from each other, meaning turn the volume up on 1, they both go up. This applies to any controls on the mics whatever changes you make on one, it will do on both. I would say this little speaker even without the mics would be great just to bluetooth to at the park or get togethers. I would definitely buy again if I needed to.",

                "reviewText": "At the time of this review, this kids' karaoke machine was available in four different colors and a choice of one or two microphones. The one I'm reviewing here has a single microphone. But whichever one you choose; you're going to make the kids happy.These small karaoke machines put out decent sound for their size. This particular one has the option of connecting via Bluetooth, Micro-SD or USB. It does not matter if you turn on the microphone or the karaoke machine first, they will pair immediately. And stay paired for up to 50 feet distance.If you use the Micro-SD or the USB to play the songs, it will immediately start playing once you insert your media. A quick press of the power button will pause the playback. Most buttons have dual functions. The volume up and down will adjust the volume with a short press, but a long press will change the song. The power button also controls the pause function. There is also a button to change the interface and one for the LED lighting effects.You control the volume of your voice with the controls on the microphone. The five voice changing effects are also controlled by the microphone.This particular unit has a headphone jack. Some of these karaoke machines have an aux input instead. Therefore, you need to pay attention to this when you purchase to make sure you get the features you want. I personally like the headphone option as it allows the kids to listen to their music while you get some peace and quiet.This karaoke machine comes with two charging cables, but no charger. You need to provide that along with whichever media you want to use.In conclusion, I love these little karaoke machines. They are fun for both kids and adults alike. An easy 5-stars for this fun little karaoke machine.",

                "reviewText": "I'm reviewing a few of these units. This is the second one I test. The previous one was a K13 model (It have a round led ring and a plastic center for speaker).I previously would recommend the K13 versus the K12, but I've changed opinion. They are basically the same price.The advantage of the K12 is that is look much better in a smaller nicer form factor. Even the microphone, the K12 look better.But I said the K12 sounded worst, and it doesn't have the natural voice option, so by reviewing a different product, it had more instruction and found I could disable the echo/reverbe... You long press the +/- volume on the microphone, and you can change the intensity level of the echo. It will always activate at boot, but you can disable it. As for the sound quality, the trebble is better on the K12, but it lack of bass... After doing more back to back test, I decided to say I prefer this version !My K12 I received had some defective assembly, where the speaker grill doesn't stay attached but that is easily fixed.I also receive another smaller model, the K1 I think, and the K12 is much better. The K1 I got had 2 microphone with it, and to my surprise, the second microphone did work with my K12, so I could use 2 microphone with it.The K13 microphone doesn't work with the K1 or this one, the K12.So it not amazing in term of sound quality, but it a fun toy (and I say here toy), to have.",
