                "reviewText": "I don't know how to compare this to a professional condenser mic, I'm sure there's a noticable difference in quality to someone that knows their stuff. But for a USB mic that plugs straight into my PC without having to use an XLR adapter, this works perfectly for me. I use it for occasional voice over, or for my mic when I'm on discord. It has clear pickup quality, and doesn't catch too much of the excess room noise (my room isn't sound proofed at all). I swapped the USB that came with the mic for a longer one, but that was the only necessary modification for my purposes. I'm not in love with the mount, but it does support the mix without tipping or being unbalanced. All and all Im really happy with this mic, it works good, looks good, makes me feel slightly more professional.",

                "reviewText": "So I wanted to start doing some review videos, and I'm trying to put together a budget audio system to do voiceovers and the like. I came across the microphone, the price was right and so I went ahead and ordered it.The Mic works, but the audio requires normalization and some amplification to get it to a level that is usable. Because it is USB, I can't run it through a mixing board or external amplifier. I am limited with the amount of gain I have natively, so to be honest, I'm not real impressed with it.While this is not a great microphone, IMHO, it appears upon further research that you can make it sound good with post processing, and using some filters in third party applications. I think for the money i would rather go with an XLR mic vs USB, and add an inexpensive mixing board to get the input sound I want before it is imported into the workstation. Mediocre in equals mediocre out.BTW, you will most likely have delays when trying to use two USB microphones, for example in an interview situation (so I've read). I'd highliy recommend doing some research on USB vs. XLR if you're new to this like me.I would not buy this again knowing what I know now, as it does not fit my use case. Do your research.",
