First the quality of the mic and both receivers were very light and fragile feeling. I was only able to test the receivers once and they failed within a week later. Because the mic had an iPhone adaptor I was able to use it on the iPhone we use to stream on Sundays. So the mic half lasted longer only because it was being used once a week for only an hour. I did not charge it every day so that it would not overcharge, but that didn't work because it stopped working and no longer would charge via the charging case. (Now I tried to return it and the window closed for returns in August) my advice...keep searching",

                "reviewText": "I've seen mixed reviews for people who have received this with the big white logo, and some who didn't have the logo. Ofcourse I received the one with the logo. I'm not really into free advertisement and don't want the big white noticeable logo on my lapel mic in all my videos, so I used a razor blade (You can use sandpaper also) and scraped the logo off. It came off very easily, although now I have superficial scratches on the mics. The mere fact that i even needed to scrape the logo off makes me drop this to 3 stars. Idc that the logo is on the reciever, but this company should know better than to put their logo on the mics knowing people will be making videos. Also, the receiver doesn't fit it youre using a phone case. I have to completely remove my phone case to use this thing. Set up was easy, once i plugged in the reciever, i pressed and held the button on one of the mics until the light turned green. No searching for device via bluetooth which was nice. As for sounds quality, it seems to be okay. I tried it in my garage where I will be making my instructional videos, and you could hear me well, and it dampened some of the echo. But when a truck went by, the sound of the truck was distorted. In all, it does what it is intended to do and it's better than the raw mic on my phone.",
