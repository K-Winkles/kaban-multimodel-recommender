Its not very expensive so if you lose it, its not something that you will worry about finding price wise.I tried this mic out on Video calls and a few home made videos. It work well for what it costed. Only one issue I had with the mic, It kinda makes your voice sound squeaky when you are right on top of it speaking into it. I tried to see if mute button made a sound when clicking it while making a video and I did not hear any clicking sounds.I paid 15.99 for this product. The product more than likely cost around 5 dollars to manufacture minus the cost for packaging,shipping and selling the product. Taking this in consideration its actually a good product for the price.",

The sound quality meets my expectations. However, the mute button is less visible than advertised; it's not as bright, making it difficult to discern whether it's activated or not in a well-lit room. It's somewhat easier to see with the lights off, but I intend to use it mostly with the lights on. Despite this, I'm satisfied with the microphone's overall function and feel it's worth the investment, so I'll be keeping it.",

I love having Amazon Prime! They never disappoint! Now back to the microphone, he plugged it in and it worked immediately. He has a desktop computer. He\u2019s 13 and has had terrible luck with microphones that are connected to headphones! But this microphone is a plug and play and it works like a charm. Don\u2019t hesitate to buy this and the Price is Right!!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this mic because I wanted a gaming mic just for fun and to voice call with friends on computer. At first, it was everything I could ask for. The sound production was good, it was sweet and simple and it even came with extra heads. Around 3 weeks after I received it, my friend started to say they heard some 'buzzing' noise. I figured it was their headphones because after readjusting it, it worked well. Now(around 10 days after i couldn't return it), I realized it must be internal damage, though I never was rough with it and let it stay at my desk only. The buzzing sound fluctuates from loud to quieter, even when I adjust the wiring. Overall was a good mic until that happened, I wanted to leave this in case someone wants to consider this might happen to them.",

                "reviewText": "Was looking around for a basic mic for a diy project and decided to give this one a try. For the price, this microphone feels well constructed. Overall it's pretty light in weight with most of the weight being in the base. The base has three rubber pads and feels substantial enough to keep it from tipping over.The recorded sound seems very clear. As for the quality of the sound that really depends on what you're expecting and the equipment you're using. I can't speak about the noise-cancellation capabilities it advertises because I'm not sure how exactly to test for that but I imagine it's comparable to other mics in this price range.A good no-frills microphone that works. It came in a nice sturdy box with a carrying sack. Only setup I had to do was to plug it into the usb slot. Windows picked up on it, installed what it had to install, and it started working.",
