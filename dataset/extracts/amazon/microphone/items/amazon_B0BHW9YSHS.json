                "reviewText": "So the quality isn't quite as good as say, a professional streaming mic.... like the Wave 3....but the quality is definitely up there in that bracket for streamer mics.The distance/range on these suckers is bonkers. I can walk around my entire house and keep a stable connection. That's 2 stories, 6000 sqft. Walls and all.They come with a dead-cat/style cap to soften sounds, and have integrated noise cancelling which does a fair job. I don't even need Nvidia Broadcast to filter background noise, they do great on their own.They work with my phone and with my PCs. Unfortunately if you want both mics working, there's no way to limit / mute one or the other like a conference mic. I would hope they add the capability for easy self-muting so both mics can be active without an issue.Both mics CAN be active, sync well, and will work for hours, so if you wanted to use them for group-streaming on Twitch or jouranlistic endeavors, etc, you totally could.They can be individually hooked up to charging cables, which seems to let them keep running even if they're completely drained... and they charge very quickly from their dock/hub.They can be powered down completely independently, and they each have their own noise cancellation toggle.If you need a semi-affordable wireless / lapel mic, this is going to be a game changer for you. I use it for gaming and conference calls and it's amazing the freedom it brings.They're suck a non-bother, you forget you're wearing it.It would be nice to get a chirp or something to announce when it has a low battery, but the LED indicator usually gives me enough warning.There is another version of these which is a tad more expensive with some more features... but I do not regret my purchase.",

FaceTime assumes you're trying to both speak and listen at the same time (which requires signal cancellation in the microphone), and the Lark C1 doesn't support that. FaceTime knows this and defaults back to the internal mic. Using this microphone to broadcast a webinar over Zoom worked fantastically well. The sound quality is significantly better than those $30 lavalier mics and my audience loved the improvement. When not in noice cancellation mode, even ambient music came through. Seems pretty good for the price. I'm sorry my original review was bad -- turns out it was user error. I'm sure pleased now!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased these in July of 2023 and use these often for work. I had to get a new phone since my other iPhone pooped out on me. I got an iPhone 15 pro max since it was the best deal my wireless provider was offering at the time. Well fun fact Apple changed their phone charging ports again. So I had to buy adapters for the charging port so I could plug the receiver for the mics in. The receiver still does not work and I reached out to Hollyland customer service and the only answer they provided is that the new iPhones aren\u2019t comparable with their app so I\u2019m basically SOL. Their response literally said \u201csorry for the inconvenience\u201d. So now I\u2019m out $110 with no solution because the app they provide doesn\u2019t work with iPhone 15 and they said the adapters won\u2019t work either. I wish I could return but I\u2019m outside the return window. What a flaw in their product production. And honestly the mics were trash anyways.",

Excellent audio quality3. Audio playback via iPhone speaker. The lightning connection doesn't disable the audio output like the original lightning to 3.5mm adapter. So I can monitor the sound right after the recording. This is especially useful when using it with iMove or CapCut editing software on iPhone.4. Its lighting charging pass-through port to allow charging and mic access at the same time.5. Noise reduction feature works great.6. Very lightweight and reliable. Ideal for gimbal work.It would be a perfect mic if it can add 2 additional features:1. Remote shutter control (press a button to trigger shutter. DJI mic has this feature.)2. 3.5mm audio output for wired headphone monitoring (I understand why it's not there as the DAC may increase the size and weight of the mic)",

                "reviewText": "I use radio microphones professionally and I can say that the really good ones cost a lot of money. But, I wanted something quick and easy that I could just pop onto my iphone and start shooting interviews. I was highly sceptical I could achieve that at the price point this product is on offer for! How wrong could I be? Let me tell you how good they are. With a couple of tips. The microphone (bluetooth transmitter unit) clips onto the interviewee lavalier style. So, a collar, a tie, but no further than a foot away from the mouth but not too close either. Make sure you use the included wind gag if outdoors. Inside that mic unit is the transmitter. This part of the two pieces will need to be charged with the USB cable. It holds a good charge, I have used it for the most of about an hour maximum, and it still plenty of juice left in it. The receiver, you plug into the bottom of your smartphone. You download an app. (all instructions for this come with the device) The app will enable you to control certain parameters. Like: level of background noise cancelation. I keep mine on minimum as any kind of processing lowers sound quality a little. And also, I don't film interviews anywhere really noisy anyway. Once you have plugged the mic receiver into your phone and turned on the transmitter (the mic unit) you will see it pair with the bluetooth light stopping flashing. Then you are ready to go. I would warn against your interviewees speaking really loudly, which some people tend to do when wearing a radio mic. If you are more than a few feet away they start to shout. They don't realise that the mic will pick up their voice without needing to. If they shout, it will distort a little. Next, you'll want to make sure it has recorded...so you play back your shot on the phone...but heck! There's no sound! That's because the device is still plugged into the smart phone....*but* there's a setting on the Hollyland app which you can activate which lets you hear play back without having to unplug the receiver each time. Works a treat. Also, remember, the receiver does not need to be charged, it gets power from your phone. Distance? Outdoors I have been 100 feet away line of sight and recorded perfect sound. And one other *important* point. The receiver is so small and so light, that you can use it when the phone is mounted on a stabilizing gimbal like the DJI Osmo Mobile 6, (available from Amazon) and it does not throw it off balance at all. This was the deal maker for me. A great combo. I am thrilled with this product. Thank you, Hollyland!",

                "reviewText": "Vorneweg - ich nutze das Mikrofon f\u00fcr Videobotschaften Diverser K\u00fcnstler in den Social Media Plattformen, also Instagram & Co!Nach langem Hin und Her, nach ettlichen Billig-Produkten reinf\u00e4llen, hab ich mich f\u00fcr das Hollyland Lark C1 entschieden und habe es nicht Bereut. Obwohl mir vom Kundendienst mitgeteilt wurde, dass das Produkt nicht mit meinem Google Pixel 8Pro funktioniert, hab ich es trotz meiner Bedenken Bestellt, ich habe ja auch noch ein 2. Handy von Xiaomi (Mi 9T Pro).Das Mikrofon funktioniert mit meinem Xiaomi Einwandfrei und diese Tatsache stellte mich schon mal zufrieden. Danach hab ich das Mikrofon nat\u00fcrlich auch noch mit meinem Pixel 8 Pro getestet. Es funktionierte erstmal nicht. Ich habe dann in den Einstellungen ein Externes, Kabelgebundenes Mikrofon, gew\u00e4hlt und dann hat es Einwandfrei Funktioniert. Anzumerken sei, das ein Handy nat\u00fcrlich nicht sieht, ob am Mikrofon ein Kabel dranh\u00e4ngt. Ausschlaggebend war und ist, das der C Eingang ein Mikrofon ist ... mit oder ohne Kabel - Egal.Das Klangbild ist Hervorragend, weitere Einstellm\u00f6glichkeiten gibt es Via Knopfdruck am Mikrofon selbst - Rauschunterdr\u00fcckung, Nebenger\u00e4usch Reduzierung. Auch in der LarkSound App sind weitere Einstellungen m\u00f6glich. Was bei meinen Mobiltelefonen nicht funktioniert ist das Direkte mith\u00f6ren der Aufnahme, vielleicht hab ich es aber auch noch nicht gecheckt wie ich die Einstellungen ver\u00e4ndern muss, dass das Funktioniert. Meines erachtens ist das aber auch nicht n\u00f6tig denn ... ich h\u00f6re ja sowieso was mein Gegen\u00fcber erz\u00e4hlt! Macht er einen Fehler wird die Aufnahme einfach Wiederholt.Erw\u00e4hnenswert sei auch, das der Kundendienst hervorragend ist. Jede meiner Fragen wurden innerhalb von 24 Stunden Bearbeitet ... Fachm\u00e4nnisch!Die Verarbeitung ist sehr Gut, das Case ist sehr wertig sowohl von der Verarbeitung als auch Optisch. Die Aufbewahrungstasche ist Sch\u00f6n und erf\u00fcllt seinen Zweck.So kann ich guten Gewissens eine Klare Kaufempfehlung f\u00fcr dieses Mikrofon abgeben - Klasse Preis Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis.",
