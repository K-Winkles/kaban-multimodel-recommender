                "reviewText": "I read the comments concerning this mic... first of all, those of you who are making the bad comments are not reading the specifications of the microphone, second, this particular mic is made of plastic (42BK) and there is one Pyle sells for that comes in a metal case. Do your homework! I bought this mic because I wanted something vintage and not expensive for my chat, Skype and for using it on Echolink (Internet based Amateur Radio Communications program). This mic suits that purpose. After setting it up and having adjusted the volume levels on my soundcard, this microphone works beautifully and my voice is clear on the receiving end of the conversation. I have attached a couple of photos of this mic on a an Audio2000 AST 421 Microphone Desktop stand that I also bought on Amazon. It's the perfect height. With my software, I control the PTT (Push To Talk) with the space bar on Echolink and with the chat program, the PTT is controlled by the CTRL key (keep in mind the on and off switch on the microphone must be left in the on position when using it on these programs). I absolutely recommend this microphone to all my Ham Radio Buddies and to all who want a simple but inexpensive microphone for chatting or Skyping. I will be purchasing the Pyle 68BK (Metal Casing) to add to my collection. Shipping was fast and received everything in working order.",

It\u2019s plastic but sturdy enough I leave it on the stand in a bag with other stands I carry in and out of gigs. I can\u2019t tell the difference sound-wise between this and the Behringer 58 clones I used to use and vanity wise I\u2019m way cooler with this one. If you\u2019re into the magic a mic adds to your voice maybe spring for a beta 58, you\u2019re probably not looking for a retro mic anyway. The only knock I have is the stand threads are plastic, may not last, we\u2019ll see. First handful of gigs no problems, if it craps out I\u2019ll buy another.",

It feels pretty flimsy, so I wouldn't expect it to take very much use. The photos make it look flat black, but it's a fairly shiny plastic. I have the NADY 200, version of this, and it sounds very much the same, but is built like a tank- it's 10 years old and work fine. If you are going to do anything very serious- I'd buy the Nady or better yet a real shure 555.",

                "reviewText": "The quality on this microphone is definitely less than I'd hoped.In the details, it said \"Rugged Construction & Steel Mesh Grill\". It doesn't feel like rugged construction and the steel mesh grill must be hidden inside because you can't see anything metal on the unit, other than the angle adjustment screw.In re-reading the item description, it does mention that it is plastic construction, however, it is list under a bullet point regarding pickup/polar pattern, so I apparently didn't read that line item well enough. Kind of seems to be hidden under another area so that people won't notice it is clearly cheap plastic construction.There was also a rattling noise inside when moving it around. After a few minutes, a small piece of metal fell out. I have no idea if this is a spare piece of soldering material or something that is broken. After that fell out, there is still another rattling noise, so I can just tell that it is very poor quality and not something the intended gift recipient would want.The last quality related complaint is that by simply picking up the microphone for the first time, the small plastic \"on/off\" bezel around the power switch was stuck to my hand. I pulled it off of my hand and realized it was part of the microphone that I had to stick back in place. I can only imagine that this would soon fall off and turn up missing under normal use.I'll be honest, I didn't even plug it in to test it. I am not willing to put up with the quality issues, even if it sounded decent at this point.",
