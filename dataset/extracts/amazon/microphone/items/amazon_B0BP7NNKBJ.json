                "reviewText": "I'm impressed with the quality of this mic! It's very easy to use!I need to clear something up though! Soooo many people are complaining & sending this product back saying it's defective because the charging cord that comes in the box doesn't fit the adapter that goes into the phone. They are correct, it doesn't fit, HOWEVER, the cord that came in the box is to charge the mics! You are supposed to use your NORMAL PHONE CHARGER to go into that port on the adapter... I almost fell into the same trap as everyone else but thought about it, tried my normal charger and WHA-LA! Do not make the same mistake as everyone else, bashing this product & company due to USER ERROR.All in all, great product! I'm excited I finally have mini microphones! LOL",
