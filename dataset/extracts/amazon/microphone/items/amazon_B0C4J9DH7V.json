                "reviewText": "This live streaming device has certainly elevated the audio quality of my streams, earning compliments for its pristine and robust sound from my guests. Its user-friendly design adds to its appeal, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced users alike. However, a couple of notable issues have surfaced during my usage.On the positive side, the sound quality is exceptional, delivering a professional-grade audio experience. The ease of use and straightforward setup contribute to a hassle-free streaming process, allowing me to focus on content creation rather than technical intricacies.One significant drawback, however, is the limited battery life. For livestreams extending beyond 1.5 hours, I've experienced sudden audio loss, which can be frustrating, especially during longer sessions. While the inclusion of a pair of microphones is a thoughtful touch, the device's reliance on battery makes it essential for users to plan accordingly or consider external power sources for extended use.The most concerning issue I encountered was the failure of the plugin part to the phone, rendering the device currently unusable. This failure occurred after only moderate use, raising questions about the overall durability and longevity of the product. I plan to request a replacement, hoping that this is an isolated incident rather than a common flaw.In summary, while the device excels in delivering high-quality sound for live streaming, the issues with battery life and potential durability concerns need to be addressed by the manufacturer. The inclusion of replacement microphones is appreciated, and with improvements in these areas, this device could become a go-to tool for live streamers seeking premium audio quality.",

This product was very easy to use -- just insert the receiving device in an iPhone or iPad port and clip the microphones to each person's lapel. The recorded audio is clear and it did not pick up the other person's voice even though both were in the same room and 5 feet apart.Was really surprised and how good these were despite being very reasonably priced.",

                "reviewText": "So this product functions directly as promised, and delivers decent, sound quality with minimal background noise. The beware part is that if your iPhone is in a case, there is a likelihood that the base will not plug into your iPhone deep enough for the function. For me, this was an easy fix. I simply purchased a lightning cable extender, I plugged the extender into the phone and then the base into the extender. So the downside to that aside from having to buy another item and keep another item is that it does not light up the red light on the microphone so you\u2019re not sure that it\u2019s working. That small item aside I\u2019m more than willing to put up with it as this unit does a really good job of recording with minimal noise And the battery function is fantastic. This would get a four stars maybe even a five if there was not the issue of being able to plug it in to a phone in a case.",
