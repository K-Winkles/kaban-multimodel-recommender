                "reviewText": "At this price point I wasn't expecting much, but the build quality is great and the sound quite decent. If you have a singer in your band who likes to swing the mic around on its cable or a speaker who does the \"mic drop\" (that is so passe now), this is the mic for you. I don't know that audiences will hear the difference through a PA system, and if you're recording instruments I would use a completely different type of mic anyway such as a ribbon or condenser mic depending on the instrument. What I will say, is the level is really low, so you should probably get a pre-amp. That kind of defeats the low price point, but you can use pre-amps for different mics. If I were gigging consistently, I'd outfit the band with these mics for vocals since it wouldn't be such a big deal if they were stolen or broken through mistreatment.",

Produces a GREAT sound for a disrespectfully small amount of money. Don\u2019t know how they do it but shove your money in their hand and take off running!Great product at a good price point. One of the last true values out there. It\u2019s a wired mic, that\u2019s fine.. Don\u2019t be prissy about it. Wireless is not a necessity for \u201call\u201d people. Every mic I ever saw growing up was wired. If it was good enough for Bruce Springsteen and Martin Luther King, it\u2019s good enough for you doing much less important things.Those of you who are audio engineers and can tell the ever so slight difference between mics and small incremental adjustments in sound levels. Then get the $750 mic that you\u2019ve been looking at.For people that only have a small budget and aren\u2019t recording or want it to be wireless or to do things with sound regular people don\u2019t even know how to do. This is more than sufficient.I use mine with a broadcast speaker to share the Gospel of Christ, speaking and for singers to sing and the sound is warm and beautiful. Sounds like it cost 10x more than it did.",

This Sure SM48 fit the bill perfectly and performs great. I am getting excellent audio reports from other radio operators. Great sound at a great value.",

                "reviewText": "The first SM48 I received from Amazon was defective. Amazon promptly sent me a replacement after I returned the bad one. Great job Amazon! I had my replacement the next day! The replacement is working great and it sounds pretty good for a budget mic. I never expected this mic to be a high end microphone at this price point but for what it is I'm pleased with the sound quality. I run it into an old Symetrix 528E voice processor and the two work well together. I do not need a preamp for the SM48 to drive the 528. This mic would be ideal for a church that needs good PA mics on a budget or even a band that's just starting out. Although there is a slight difference in sound quality between the SM48 and it's famous big brother the SM58, most people won't hear it on a PA system or in a live setting. If budget is not a concern, get the SM58, but if your money is tight but you need a decent mic, this will do the job nicely for you.",

Amazon quickly sent a replacement, the mic arrived just in time for rehearsal. The mic works perfectly and has a warm rich and refined sound. Nothing like the 1st one I got. This restored my faith in Shure microphones as I was distraught after the first experience.",
