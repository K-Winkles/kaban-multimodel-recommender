                "reviewText": "This was more of a 3.5 Stars, I rounded up. Generally, its good BUT you must adjust equalizer settings to get decent audio.Here is more detailed:I was going to return this, because the sound quality was abysmal. Like so bad, I tested it on my phone, and my laptop, and PC. Its highest settings is 48000 Htz (DVD Quality) wired, or Bluetooth; however, I adjusted my equalizer settings, on my PC, and was able to make it sound great. The range on the wireless is great. I am able to use it in my entire apartment, as well as the patio outside. What really amazed me was the battery. You will definitely not outlast it. It doesn't block outside noise (through the speakers, i mean), but for me that is ok. The microphone isn't what I would hope. But its good enough for what I paid. Oh, finally: There is an on/off button for the mic, so you can be sure its off when you want it to be. It even has a voice that says \"Microphone Off\".Overall, its great in almost every aspect except for the need to adjust equalizer settings. The mic could be better. You will have to change it back when you change to speakers.",

                "reviewText": "I was hesitant at first, because for me, buying headphones that are comfortable wearing around the ears for long periods of time ,and sound quality are two biggest things for me... and battery life, but for now that's on the back burner until they need to be fully charged- im just going off of the amount of time they were charged...The padding around the ears is so soft and perfect for wearing for long periods of time...and OMG the sound quality!!! Absolutely did NOT disappoint!So Stoked I came across these BT headphones... I only charged them up maybe 20 min, once that little light turned green, you know you're a gamer/nerd when you get excited over headphones. Like a kid in a candy store with diabetes... My face lit up once I heard that night blues soundtrack on YT... I got so excited to see how they would sound... So I went through the instructions and hooked them up to my home PC and Let me tell you...YAAAAAS !! Get you a pair of these ASAP Rocky!! <3-Thank you from a Very satisfied customer!",
