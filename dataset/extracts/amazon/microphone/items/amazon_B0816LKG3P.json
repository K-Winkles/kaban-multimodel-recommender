She opened it, and liked it, but didn't love it. UNTIL I paired it to my blue tooth and put on a show for her. At that point, she decided she loved it, but I was already really into my performance, so she didn't get it back. Anyway, probably going to tour with this mic as my band. Pretty excited. Great product, fun, and I totally wish I had one of these when I was a kid.",

It looks like a toy, but it's a powerhouse little fun tool! Disclosure: I was offered $15 to write a 5-star review but that happens a lot and I ONLY write the reviews that I actually believe deserve 5-stars. This one I did without hesitation.",

                "reviewText": "I got this karaoke mic for my three-year-old daughter, and while it's fun to play around with, the audio quality is pretty bad. It sounds really tinny and flat, especially when you're playing music via Bluetooth - it's like the sound is coming out of a tin can. My daughter doesn't seem to care - she just likes to sing and make noise with it.One thing I do like about this mic is that it's really easy for kids to use. My daughter had no trouble figuring out how to turn it on and make silly noises. It's also pretty tough - my daughter has dropped it a few times already, but it's still working just fine.Overall, I'd say this is a decent option if you're looking for a toy to keep your kid entertained for a while. But if you're serious about your karaoke, or you want something with better sound quality, you should probably look for a higher-end model.",
