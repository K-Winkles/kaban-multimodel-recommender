                "reviewText": "I went through quite a few different products trying to find a good and loud and clear wireless microphone and a decent price. I found it here with this product. The plus side was that it has Bluetooth so you can run music through it and still use it as wireless microphone set. I purchased one that one mic was cutting out when I placed my hand at the bottom of the mic to hold it. I given a replacement unit & it worked great. Each mic comes with Volume adjustment up to Vol 5 on top of the Volume buttons for each line on the box itself. These mics are loud and sometimes u have to turn em down a little bit. It's not a bad thing at all, but a good problem to have cause u can adjustment Volume on both mics and the box itself. Voice quality comes out clean and clear, I use these for Djing and people tell me that they are very clear and they are. I even use the Bluetooth to run music through it and through my Mixer with adds and boosts the sound that's going through the mixer. This Bluetooth box has great sound quality even when running music through it. I was impressed with this unit booth sound quality and clarity. If using for Djing or an event or on a professional level these will do great for you, if using for home they will out do that by far hands down...Great unit and I'm so pleased with it and great for its value and quality and clarity and loudness too. Also good quality. Mics are not plastic, they are metal and seem to hold up well. Connection is good too. I didn't test long range because for my applications they all will be within close proximity, a couple feet.And for me it works great... and price is too for all that you get with this unit....",

The volume controls are very overpowered. I use them with a \"1\" setting on the mic, and 3 clicks from zero on the receiver. Mids need to be brought down more than the 58s I'm used to.",

(Creating and emailing videos can be challenging for some\u2026).As far as the unit goes,It works well, Versatile, Comes with multiple connectors.Reasonably good sound quality. Need to hold the mic in a certain position.But works well for most situations. Very easy to setup and operate including built-in bluetooth connectivity.",

                "reviewText": "I bought on a lightning deal and also cuz of the pandemic quarantine to spice things up at home. I used to go out sporadically to karaoke places. My wife is into it more than I am but seems to have reversed- I have used this more than she has.This is a lower end model. There are no tone controls on the receiver - the mics (you get two) are color coded. They are made of plastic not the best but it\u2019s adequate for the paid price.Here\u2019s my set up:I hooked up a laptop hdmi out to a Sony TV - I bluetooth the sound from the laptop to the bietrun (pairing is easy - and a lady with a heavy Chinese accent says it\u2019s successful- from the bietrun i hardwire it to a schiit audio magni 1 (original Verizon) headphone amplifier so I can control volume - then u plug into the headphone Jack of a 1990s pair of active self powered speakers (Sony SRS-150). I didn\u2019t want to hook it up to my AVR and it works great!!! Even though the speakers are about 20 watts per channel it fills the room. I use The old you tube for the backing tracks.The signal reception from mic to receiving device is great. It is very clear but I don\u2019t have a big living space.The mics control the rudimentary echo (reverb) remember to put it to full max when you\u2019re singing \u201cin the air tonight\u201d it rocks, treble, bass, and volume of the mics. Each mic can control their own. The tone controls aren\u2019t great but good enough.I\u2019ve had this for a couple months now and used it 4x? It\u2019s worth a pick up if you want something simple and you\u2019re not a hardcore karaoke gotta have the best sound system. It\u2019s good for people who just wanna belt out a few tunes now and again.Thanks for reading.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this product for a working event band, based on earlier reviews and user recommendations! I will say they are very user friendly and simple to plug and play. The bluetooth connection is an absolute plus for weddings and banquets, good for ambience music. That being said, they have a 50ft range at best. After 3 attempts given for them to redeem themselves...... Continuous drop outs during speechs and solo selections! Static when electronics cross between the mics and receiver. They always perform well in sound checks and small backyard parties. Anything over 40 guests with phones and bluetooth electronics affects ALL the frequency options! I wish I could get my money back. Has gotten me bad reviews for failure during critical moments!****Update****After more experimenting with the receiver placement and antenna extensions, ive been having better results. Been using them in less important situations, i.e bar gigs! Still not ready to try on wedding or speaking engagements yet, but i am going to try using them for stationary band member vocals..",
