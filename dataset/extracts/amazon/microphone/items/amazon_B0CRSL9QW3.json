                "reviewText": "I have used this legendary microphone for over 50-years as a working professional, and it has NEVER let me down, even once, and I was a traveling rock drummer doing one-night stands for most of my life. Not only does it sound great, but it is as tough as NAILS, always and important consideration during the grueling pressures of live performance (in a pinch, it will even double as a hammer). I always buy the one with the ON/OFF switch, as it instantly stops any feedback problems, as well as silencing the mic from any unwanted noises. While some people seem to be worried about the addition of an on off switch as far as reliability is concerned, they simply don't know what they're talking about. I have only needed two of these mics for my entire professional career, AND NOT A SINGLE SWITCH EVER FAILED TO FUNCTION OR WAS EVER DAMAGED FROM HEAVY USE. This fear is totally unfounded, as well as any mistaken belief that a switch interferes with the sound quality... it doesn't.P.S. I just purchased a Sennheiser e945 as a possible upgrade to this mic, and I HATED it. The feedback issues were horrific (particularly with no on-off switch to deal with it), it was twice as heavy, and worse still, my vocals just didn't sound as good, from top to bottom.P.P.S. Today, Labor Day 2022 I was doing a live gig outdoors, when I actually tripped over the mic cord and the mic slammed directly into the concrete, HARD. I was a little worried since this was my only mic, but of course, the 58 came through beautifully, with just a little dent in to windscreen. When you career depends on it, leave it to Shure to come through, every time.",

                "reviewText": "I made the mistake of thinking I could save forty bucks and get by with the Shure PG-58. I'm no vocalist but occasionally need to do announcements or accommodate a guest vocalist through an instrument amp (rather than a P.A.). Whatever the reason, the PG-58 simply doesn't have sufficient gain or oomph to be of much use with the Roland Cube / Peavey amps I try to employ it with (I use a 1/4\" adapter with the XLR connector that comes with the mic). When I borrow a Shure SM-58 mic from someone, the difference is instant and dramatic--it's a far more efficient (i.e. louder) mic, producing a full, clear sound, and without additional pre-amplification, demonstrating why it's the most popular microphone in the world. For five bucks extra, I can't fathom a reason for avoiding the SM-58S, the version with an on-off switch. It's a small price to pay for quick solutions to feedback or the unwanted pick-up of \"private\" comments by indiscreet band members. And even if you're an instrumentalist, it may be wiser to select the SM-58 over the SM-57. The former mic is a little more ostentatious, but it's also slightly more adaptable, and the screen can filter out a certain amount of wind noise and unwanted non-musical sounds. Above all, the SM-58 has proven itself to be the Sherman tank of microphones, simply unparalleled for ruggedness and durability.[I see a review cautioning the consumer to be wary of \"this seller.\" Perhaps a good point unless it's in reference to Amazon Prime, which is the Shure SM-58 of commerce: competitive prices, no postage, easy returns. But anyone who returns an SM58 probably had no business buying it in the first place. They are the populous drones of the industry, invariably purchased by professionals who know first-hand what they're getting--reliability and virtual indestructibility. In fact, it's the very popularity of the SM58 that has led to all of the slightly less or more expensive imitators. Consumers require choice, but with the Shure SM58 there need be none.]",

You'll never be disappointed, as these mics are just amazing.I've been using mine for the past 2 weeks now, and I feel since I've upgraded, the sound that resonates is much better than my other Shure microphone (which is still an amazing microphone).Definitely put your money here, as the guitar stand is very compatible, has locking feet, and an XLR cable included. Such a great price!",
