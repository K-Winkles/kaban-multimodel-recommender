                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. In this price range, you won't find better quality for a wireless handheld microphone. The receiver has a 1/4\" jack connexion, that means it is not professional audio like XLR connector is, but for home parties or a karaoke setup it is very good. I compared the sound with a Shure SM58 and the tone difference is not that big. The unit is very light, so maybe not heavy duty, but again, in this range of price, it is understandable. It looks good, like pro unit (Sennheiser or Samson). I tested it at a 50' distance without any drop out or interference.",
