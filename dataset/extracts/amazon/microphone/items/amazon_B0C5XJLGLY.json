                "reviewText": "I bought this for Social Media purposes. The microphones are easy to use and I love that the adaptor can go through either the cellphone or your computer. I used my computer so I had a safety recording on the cell phone as a backup and I have needed it in a few instances. The noise cancelling is very good. My daughter was putting hard plastic pieces onto another hard plastic and the microphone did not pick it up. However, the noise cancelling feature made it difficult to record if the voice being recorded got too loud with a shout of excitement or talking loud in excitement. Thankfully, this did not happen often but it's a drawback. However, I am thankful for my purchase because overall, it is a very good product. Now that I know the limitations under certain circumstances, I can change how I do my recordings.",

                "reviewText": "The device works properly, came in great condition, looks great and is a great product for general small projects. However, I'm a content creator and was looking for something that provides better audio quality than my phone and, unfortunately, I was not able to use it for my videos, since it makes it sound like I'm somewhat distant or under water slightly...when compared to the audio quality of my phone. To be fair, I may need a $100-200 mic for the type of work I do but wanted to try a less expensive option. Again, overall it's a great quality product, but not ideal for content creators.",
