Once you get it popped into place, I recommend keeping it there. It comes with a foam windscreen as well as a furry one that goes over the foam one, so you can shoot in even super windy conditions without a bunch of distortion.There are two different cables that come with the mic so it will be compatible with a wide range of products. I enjoy the on mic headphone jack to monitor audio. When you are done you can pack it back up in the included hard case with molded foam inserts for transport protection.This mic is half the price of its main competitor yet the quality is on par with the best. Save your money and invest in Movo!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Compared to the Takstar/Rode Mics, Excellent Kit, Sound Quality Really Varies On Different Devices!!",
                "reviewText": "I bought this to replace my Takstar SGC-598 Microphone, to use with my Nikon D5100 DSLR camera, after my Takstar started breaking sound, but after 3 years of super heavy usage, figured I'd upgrade and try something new, hence picking up this Movo, after endless great reviews.This microphone is by far the absolute best starter package kit and value, with everything you need, from the hard-shell case, wind muff/foam sponge, to even a wire for both your smartphone and camera, and best part is absolutely no batteries required. The case itself makes it special, since you'll feel much safer and more at ease to transport for any travelers.When used with my Android smartphone, the quality is excellent when speaking from a couple feet away, like doing a selfie style video, and even more incredible, if you hold it right next to your mouth, like a news reporter, incredibly rich and clear. I did a could blind audio tests with other mics, it's actually even better and cheaper than most Rode mics, certainly the micro model, which is in the same price range.The issues come when you're using it with any device, that has much poorer preamps, in my case my Nikon D5100 DSLR Camera. The volume is ridiculously low, unless you increase the sensitivity, but then if you do, the volume becomes perfect, but then is unable to clearly pick up higher loud sounds and has incredibly loud hiss noises. With the same default settings, it's moderately better than the Takstar SGC-598, however there is 1 major advantage to the Takstar. The Takstar has a +10 dB gains and High-Pass filter knobs. As a casual vlog filmmaker, I had never realized how important having such a thing was, but basically learned without that on a mic, such as the Movo, you're pretty much left deciding between either recording at low volumes or perfect volume, but very loud hiss and unclear sounds. In depth of sound, it's also bit too bassy, and doesn't have enough treble. This is where the Takstar really shines.I\u2019m contemplating whether or not to return this, on most solid devices I\u2019d highly recommend this microphone, truly is the absolute best kit out there, but for devices that need more audio demands, that becomes questionable. I think with a nice external recording device or setup where you speak directly into the mic, the Movo will be much better, but in open settings like when you're speaking anything more than 3 feet away from a camera, with low preamps, like most DSLRs, the Takstar easily without question does a significantly better job. The benefits to the Movo are all the accessories and fact you can actually use it with a smartphone, with what's provided.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using this mic for more than a year and it is amazing. It produces little noise and has lasted me through many projects. It sits nice and stable on top of my dslr. The mount is metal and plastic and the mic is metal, it feels really high quality and has a slight heft. I love the little case it comes in and it has both a mic to dslr and mic to phone cable. All the accessories provided are great. Movo makes really reliable mics. What I also like about this mic is that it provides really solid performance from far away but also close to the camera, usually my subjects are a little bit further away and this produces a nice clear professional sound with very little noise. Just get this mic.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the MOVO VXR10 PRO microphone in September 2022, but only recently started using it with my Canon EOS R10 camera. Unfortunately, I encountered some recording issues that were actually caused by the cable (which I had mistaken for a problem with the microphone itself). I was initially frustrated and wrote down a negative review, but then Jana from customer service helped me out by sending me a new cable to test. Thanks to her excellent service, the issue was finally resolved!I was impressed that MOVO provided such great support even though I am an overseas customer. I'm looking forward to enjoying this product now that the issue is resolved. If you're in the market for a microphone, I highly recommend MOVO - their products won't disappoint you!",

                "reviewText": "For the price, this is absolutely worth it. As soon as I received it, I tested it out. It comes in a neat package and includes a case for all the materials: the windscreen, the microphone itself, the red mount, and the instruction manuals. I have a Canon Rebel EOS t5i - the microphone enhances the audio and is much crispier than the camera\u2019s audio. It also come with an additional cable for smart phones. So you have 2 cables: one for cameras and one for smart phones and they\u2019re labelled as well.The only issue I had was putting on the mic on the mount. It takes a lot of force so you need to be careful because it might snap. Plus, mine came with two mounts in comparison to just one like the advertised photos. I don\u2019t know if it was intentional or not but it\u2019s all good. Other than that, that was the only issue I encountered.I think this will be a great microphone as a starter. It definitely makes a difference in filming and videos. So this is a must for those who are starting and have a budget. Worth it.",

Tiene muy buena calidad de audio, es ligero y portable y cubre las necesidades de cualquier creador de contenido.Viene con un estuche para guardarlo, el estuche es rigido y se siente seguro. Viene con las cables necesarios para conectar el movil o a una camara. Viene con el soporte para micro, y con sus protectores para el viento.Lo he probado con el iphone (toca tener el adaptador adicional a lighting) y con mi camara y en ambos casos me ha funcionado sin problema. Suelo conectarlo con audifonos y el monitoreo funciona genial, puedo ir escuchando lo que grabo sin necesidad de estar desconectando. El proctor de viento tambien reduce bastante el ruido, no del todo pero esta bien.En cuanto a sonido, las voces se oyen claras. Destaca un poco los agudos, eso hace que las voces se sientan un poco sin fuerza y que se note bastante la reverb de alguna habitaci\u00f3n, pero algo que con un poco de edici\u00f3n se soluciona facilmente.",
