                "reviewText": "Firstly, I have been a longtime fan of SteelSeries using numerous headsets of theirs over the years and have always admired their fit, finish, and overall quality. SteelSeries is also heavily pushing the use of their software (GG) alongside the promotion of this mic. And what I can say is that GG is a FANTASTIC piece of audio software. In fact, I was already using it for months with my other mic before the Alias even released. That was partly why I was excited for the Alias when it was announced because I was already so impressed with what SteelSeries had done with GG, I was really curious to see what a dedicated mic would be like from them. Seriously, if you haven't already go download GG from SteelSeries' site and check it out for yourself. In my opinion, the AI Noise Cancelation technology for the mic EQ is a MUST. It is easily the most effective software noise cancelation tech I've ever used - and it's the sole reason I've used GG for a year now. That, and the robust mic EQ. 9/10 audio software that is missing just a couple additional features which keeps it from being basically perfect.Back to the mic at hand here... from the initial looks of the Alias, I was not disappointed. It's a very unique looking mic, in an elongated oval shape, clothed in fabric, held up by a \"claw\" shaped shock mount. The aesthetics are certainly an eye catcher. I almost forgot, there is a small RGB ring on the bottom as well which illuminates nicely off of the included stand if you plan on using that. For my purposes though, it was mounted on a boom arm.Pros:+ Excellent overall build and feel. Components, while mostly plastic, feel relatively solid. The shock mount threaded bands are sturdy and support the weight of the mic with ease. There is also some nice play where you can adjust the tilt of the mic by simply moving it up or down, which allows the bands to slide in their grooves. Nice touch.+ Tap to mute = total win. The mic market needs more capacitive mute functions as each iteration seems to improve on the last. It's a bonus that there is a built-in LED within the mic capsule itself that identifies when it is muted and when it's not.+ RGBs on the bottom are nice but relatively useless if you're using it like me on a boom arm. They shine outward if you have the mic horizontally mounted, thus they don't really illuminate anything. But I get that that wasn't really their intended purpose. No doubt looks way better on the desk stand, even if that is the inferior recording setup. It's also worth noting that there are LEDs positioned further up the capsule which light up when any sound is detected. This is a nice feature and can be customized via software to your liking, including brightness and colors. It can also be disabled if its not your thing.+ Fabric looks and feels nice, unfortunately there's where it ends for that.CONS:- The lack of a decent pop filter on this mic is killer. The fabric mesh COULD have beautifully if it was at least a little thicker, or layered. But at it is it feels very thin and minimalistic, which might look nice but performs poorly in all but the quietest of rooms. This mic picks up A LOT of higher pitched noises, whether it be the s's in your speech, key taps, or wind noise. And there is LOTS of wind noise here because of the lacking wind shield/pop filter. Unfortunately it picks up tons of plosives at just 3-4 inches away, and even at a distance of about 6 to 8 inches away, what I'd consider a max distance for quality recordings, it still easily picks up both breath and wind noise. Just with my ceiling fan going overhead there were a few instances where the mic directly picked up the wind noise blowing into the capsule. This has NEVER happened on any other mic I've tested that has an included pop filter. This only ever happens if the pop filter is removed, so in this case, the Alias might as well have no wind rejection. If you plan on using this mic, make sure it is positioned away from your face/mouth, and be mindful of any moving air in your area. Big disappointment for me. Yes, you could also slide an aftermarket wind screen over it, but not only would that look fugly, it would obscure the gain LEDs. A better, more effective wind screen solution with the fabric would have been preferred. Missed opportunity for high level performance along with clean aesthetics.- Sound quality is fine, its not bad, but its also not great. I'd consider it average for a USB mic. Unfortunately at $179, anything average sounding is hard to justify for the price. It sounds better the closer you are to it, but again, as mentioned above, it can't handle plosives at all. So, that basically eliminates a closer distance positioning as a possibility. Which also negatively affects sound quality when the mic has to be positioned further away.- Would love the ability to remove the mic from the shock mount, as I very rarely ever need a shock mount on a boom arm. Or it would have been nice to see a built-in shock mount as many mics are doing nowadays, and doing so effectively. It looks cleaner and is less bulky. The shock mount with this has a claw-like design, which is subjective obviously - you may like it or not. Personally, it wasn't a great look to me; just looks a bit awkward. I would have preferred the ability to remove it and still have it mounted - unfortunately this is impossible as the shock mount is directly apart of the threaded connector. So, to have the mic mounted in any position requires the use of the shock mount. Minor quibble to most I'd imagine, just seems like an oversight to not have that option. But not a big deal either way.- Would have loved a monitor mix dial. Those are highly underrated and underappreciated and unfortunately it was missing here. The ability for on fly adjustments to what you're hearing without messing with either the gain or overall headphone volume is extremely useful.- Unfortunately, which it is impressive in many ways, I have 2 complaints. One, they need to improve the compressor functions as it is currently barely noticeable in its implementation. Especially how it limits high end noises - I notice basically no difference in having it enabled vs not. Second, a limiter function would complete the onboard suite of filters and EQ effects - that is the one feature I have found missing from the software for some reason. That, and a useful compressor. I'm hoping SteelSeries continues to flesh this software out and it only improves - so far that has been that case, but its worth pointing out its not quite the complete audio solution that it has the potential to be.Overall:This mic had numerous intriguing aspects that made me want to try it. The unique shape and design, the fabric clothing vs a traditional metal or plastic housing, the capacitive mute, and the LED gain indicators all made this mic stand out from other current offerings. Unfortunately, while SteelSeries innovated in certain areas, they certainly forgot to nail down some of the basics. Whether its the lack of a proper in-built or external pop filters, plosives and even light wind noise are a major problem here. Sound quality, while not a problem, doesn't stand out in any way, especially at this price. Not to mention there is more handling noise than I'd like to hear as well - just moving my boom arm registered on the gain LEDs. Was hoping for a bit better noise isolation at this price point.It just... it was so close. SteelSeries was really close to a winner here. Maybe next time they'll focus on actually making a good sounding mic, rather than just RGB effects and fancy design. It's a hit and miss for me, but the misses were too great to justify keeping it. I'll be looking out for more from them in the future and hope they take feedback like this to heart. If this ever falls to $99, it's a far better deal but still a difficult recommendation with such poor wind rejection.",

                "reviewText": "This is a commercial-quality microphone best suited for content creators instead of the general public. The box comes with a microphone that is suspended via tension bands (to eliminate vibrations), a desk stand, a boom adapter, a control box, an XLR cable, 2 USB-a to USB-c cables, and a power cable. There is a wiring diagram included in the instructions, but unlike other products where the USB ports are mostly interchangeable, they are not on this product. There is one main USB-c port on the control device (which goes to the computer) for connecting the microphone. The other USB-c port is for dual streaming to a secondary computer. Make sure these ports are connected correctly - the instructions don't mention the distinction but getting them wrong results in the microphone not working.Also, to use the Alias Pro, you MUST download SteelSeries' GG audio software which runs on top of your windows audio settings. Going forward, anything needing to do with audio on your computer needs to run through this software. It takes a bit to get the software installed and running - and to accommodate other sound-producing apps such as iTunes, Windows media, your browser, or any streaming apps installed on your computer. All must be mapped within the GG audio software for sound to work. However, once everything is set up and configured correctly, it works well, and the GG software gives you much more control over the quality of the sound output, including extensive equalizer functionality.Once connected with the software installed, use the control box to turn on your microphone when you want to use it. There is a button to easily mute the mic as well as a gain dial to ensure your voice is loud and dynamic enough without popping. And the quality of your recorded voice is truly outstanding. I had previously used both a wand microphone and an embedded microphone in my webcam which worked fine for Zoom calls. But the quality of sound from this microphone is ten times better. There is less background noise, no hiss, and the natural ranges of your voice come through clearly.As suggested earlier, I ran into problems installing this microphone, but SteelSeries' customer service was quite good. They only work via email and they are only available during weekday business hours, but they are knowledgeable and responsive. It took a couple of iterations to figure out my issue and the customer service agent had to talk with product specialists to get the answer. But they solved my problem.If you're looking for an easy plug-and-play microphone, this is not what you want. But, if you're looking for a professional-quality microphone and audio software platform - and don't mind changing the audio config of your computer a bit - the Alias Pro is an excellent option.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. There is two version of the SteelSeries Alias. The non-pro is significantly cheaper and has everything built in the microphone and it has a USB-C port at the back. The Pro version comes with a mixer and the microphones connect to it over XLR. The Pro version can also support 2 PC and will require the Sonar software to enable PC switching. Note that Sonar is not available for Mac.I have the Pro version- The microphone -The microphone has a pils shape design and come mounted on a nice metal shock. The base is in plastic with a metal weight. Despite being in plastic, it still feels like a quality product. There is also a metal adapter to mount the microphone on a boom arm.The sound quality is outstanding for recording vocals but there are other condenser microphone that perform similarly at cheaper price. This microphone has a Cardioid pattern which just means it's most sensitive toward the front. This microphone is still very sensitive and noises in the environment will sill get picked up. This microphone is able to record at 24 bit/48 KHz and response frequency from 50 Hz to 20 KHz. Max SPL is 120 dB. SteelSeries put a lot of enphasis on the size of the capsule which is 1 inch. In the worl of microphones, size does matter but larger is not always better. Smaller capsule has better frequency response and a more consistent pick up pattern. Smaller capsule has smaller diaphragm and smaller diaphragm will require less energy to move. Larger capsule on the other hand has a wider pick up pattern at low frequencies and a more lush sound. All of this to say that the Alias Pro will be excellent at recording vocals but won't be a good choice if you want to capture a pure sound without any added flavour.- The mixer -The mixer is entirely in plastic with added weight and a layer of silicon for stability. On my unit, the front strip of silicon unglued itself after 2 days. I was abel to glue it back. The mixer require a AC/DC adapter. It does not draw power from either of the two USB-C port. The other ports on this mixer include 1 x XLR for the microphone, 1 x 3.5mm Line Out for speakers and 1 x headphone jack for level monitoring. The mixer has two dial and two button. The left dial adjust the gain of the microphone and the left button is to mute the microphone. The right dial control the volume of the headphone jack and the right button is to mute the headphone. The right dial and right button can be remap using the SteelSeries GG Software. Every other adjustment on this mixer will need to be done using the SteelSeries GG Software. This include enable output on the second USB port, enabling Line Out, turning off Phantom power on the XLR and etc. The mixer has RGB which is sort of useful as it provide some feedback about the microphone gain. As long as you stay in the green and yellow, the recording volume should be good.- SteelSeries GG -SteelSeries Sonar is actually a really nice software package. it include the require engine to modify the Mixer RGB, EQ the audio but the best feature is to filter the recording. It can remove unwanted noise with AI. The only thing I wish it could have is some keys on the mixer to quickly activate these filters. None of the audio processing is done on the microphone or mixer so it will take some CPU cycle.Over all, it's a very nice microphone and the price reflect the quality. If you are looking for a microphone to primarily record vocals, this is a very nice choice.",

                "reviewText": "This is great for someone who's started out with a very basic microphone, knows they will produce content for years to come and want to upgrade their audio without a complicated setup.The only downside with this kit is that I would never use the desk stand, just get at least a 20$ mic arm and keep the microphone less than a feet from your mouth for best results. You can use the sonar software to turn the gain up afterwards but that way it eliminates a lot of the ambient noise without having to do any filtering, noise gate, ai pass, etcIts pricier than most streaming/podcast specific mic but you get the audio interface which means you can get an even better microphone down the road and keep the audio interface / settingsSonar is pretty intuitive and is great for splitting audio when streaming. You can drag and drop Apps to a couple of virtual audio channel then decide what audio you listen to and what the stream listens to. So you could send drm free music to your stream without having to listen to it and you could send discord chat to just you so you don't have to worry what your friends say in your stream. Overall it's very user friendly and the app has some auto mic improvement but can't make miracles, you need to point the mic at your mouth (it has a 30 degree and le of pickup) , the closer, the better (ok maybe give a few inches distance) .Overall a big leap in quality without much effort but it's a waste to buy this if you are \"thinking of getting into streaming\"",

                "reviewText": "I got the SteelSeries Alias Pro Kit mainly for conference calls and also for my YouTube channel recordings. I will mention the highlights below.Beautiful packaging: The SteelSeries Alias Pro Kit came in an orange beautifully designed package, which is also ideal for gifting. Everything inside the package is well organized and protected. One thing to note is that no part will move around inside the package since everything is very well anchored inside it. I am giving a 5-Star to this aspect.Material quality: In my opinion, the SteelSeries Alias Pro Kit is manufactured with high quality materials. It is very obvious from the first look. The mic itself is covered in a tightly covered fabric, which again is encapsulated inside a plastic casing. Forgive me if I am wrong, but under touch it feels like very sturdy plastic, which is obviously super-strong. There is a screw to adjust the mic angle, which you can do by hand and no tools are needed for this. The mic is shaped like a capsule with the SteelSeries Alias Pro Logo beautifully placed at the lower half. The whole mic is suspended on another arc-shaped chassis with elastic bands. I think this is to reduce vibration or something. The mic and frame is attached to a base plate which has something heavy inside it to hold it on the surface. 5-Star for this too.Stream Mixer: I only use the Steam Mixer to adjust gain and also to mute the mic, but never used the mixer option. If I find anything that is worth mentioning, I will do it in the future. 5-Star here as well.Audio capture range: Initially I thought of keeping the SteelSeries Alias Pro Kit near my mouth so that the audio input will be clear, but later realized that I need not keep it close. There is really good reception at about 1 and half feet away from my face and is fantastic. I don\u2019t use any headphones anymore and this setup feels so good and perfect for my daily work. 5-Stars again, would give 6-Stars if I had the option.SteelSeries Alias Pro Software: The software that comes with SteelSeries Alias Pro Kit is really powerful. There are many features I don\u2019t use. For example there is a section for \u2018Moments\u2019, which records the gameplay highlights. I played Apex Legends on PC with my friends and it captured most of the best moments during gameplay. I did not set up anything before the play session, but it recorded them and they look good. Setup was pretty easy and straight-forward, the software guides you through all the steps required for setting up the SteelSeries Alias Pro Kit. 5-Star for this.I plan to use it for my YouTube channel recordings as well using OBS Studio. Will update my review if I find something worth noting.Overall I am very happy with the purchase. I plan to use the SteelSeries Alias Pro Kit for a long time. Thanks for reading.",

                "reviewText": "This kit is a total beast and has everything you need to up your audio game.First things first, that XLR mic with the 3X bigger capsule is a monster. The audio quality is seriously impressive. My voice comes through super clear and crisp no matter the application. It's a major upgrade from what I was using before. The stream mixer is where the magic happens. It's incredibly user-friendly, and I love that I can tweak everything on the fly. The custom controls make it a breeze to fine-tune audio settings just the way I like them. The RGB lighting is also a great inclusion. It's not just there for the looks (though it does look pretty cool). It's functional too - it's a visual indicator for your audio levels, so you can quickly see if everything's running smoothly. It's a small touch, but it's one of those things that really adds to the overall experience.The SteelSeries Alias Pro Kit is the real deal for audio setups. If you're serious about gaming, streaming, or podcasting, this kit is a must-have. The audio quality, customization options, and versatility are all on point.",
