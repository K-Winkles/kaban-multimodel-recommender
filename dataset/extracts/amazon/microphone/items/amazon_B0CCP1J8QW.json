My favorite thing is kind of small, but there is no audible sound when muting or unmuting. My old device would make a noise which I always hated. It's also cool that it favors a Google Home Mini and does not look out of place in my office.",

The headset the company sent me was hurting my ears so I decided to buy this speaker with microphone for the meetings. This was a great purchase. It is very loud and clear and it has 4 microphones so. No matter where in the room you are, they will hear your clearly. Also you can use it wireless or connect through the USB cable that comes with it. This is a must have!",

Kinda cool it was has Bluetooth option, sometimes I just have to join a meeting to listen in and it's nice to be able to walk around the home and have the speaker on me. I work remote and I love having a voice speaker for my many meetings on webex. Sounds levels are great. I traveled internationally with it and it did not take a lot of space. It was nice to have the quality audio.One thing I struggle with is always remembering to ensure laptop speaker and audio are routed to the speaker during a meeting. Sometimes I mute my speaker then I can see the WebEx capturing audio because I didn't designated it correctly",
