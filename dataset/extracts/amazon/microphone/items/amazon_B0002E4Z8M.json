                "reviewText": "I purchased the Shure SM7B a few years ago and have been extremely impressed with its performance. As a professional discord talker, streamer, and gamer, I was in need of a high-quality microphone that could capture crystal clear audio, and the SM7B did not disappoint. I wanted to sound like all the professionals out there. Not knowing how it would turn out. I loved it. The comments I\u2019ve had with this mic has been surprising to how much others like the sound it produced with my voice.The build quality of the microphone is excellent. It is made of durable metal and feels solid and well-constructed. It comes with a standard XLR connection, which is compatible with most audio interfaces and mixers. The internal shock mount is a nice touch and it helps to reduce unwanted vibrations and noise from reaching the microphone.The sound quality of the SM7B is fantastic. It has a wide frequency response (50Hz - 20kHz) and a high-pass filter that helps to eliminate unwanted low-frequency rumble. It also has a mid-range boost switch that allows you to increase the clarity of vocals and spoken word. With this microphone, I am able to capture high-quality, professional-sounding audio.One of the standout features of the SM7B is its ability to handle high SPLs (Sound Pressure Levels) This means it can handle high volumes without distorting the audio, which is great for recording music or anything else with louder sources. Also its built-in pop filter and internal air suspension that helps to reduce popping and sibilance, which means less post-processing is required on your end, overall saving time.The only downside to this microphone is that it is not USB, so it needs a XLR interface to connect to a computer. And also its price point, it is an expensive microphone, but it is worth every penny if you are serious about capturing high-quality audio. I use a cloudlifter in between the mic and my Rode Rodecaster Pro sound board.Overall, I highly recommend the Shure SM7B to anyone looking for a professional-grade microphone for streamer, gamers, podcasting, voiceover work, or music recording. It is built to last and will give you the best sound quality possible, which makes it a worthwhile investment.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a musician/singer/songwriter and produce/engineer my own music with 3 album releases, yet being independent I have no claim to commercial funding so every piece of equipment I buy is a precious investment. I bought my SM7B after much research and have done numerous audio tests in my studio, with some preliminary recordings for a planned new album. (I put in this boring self-description so you can judge where I'm coming from in writing this review).I believe many/most people buy this microphone without fully understanding what they are buying. The Shure name and the hype about Michael Jackson recording with it tends to cloud the judging process, so for many it's a quick decision to buy. But a more detailed analysis reveals more characteristics and with better understanding you can put aside the hype and probably appreciate theSM7B for what it truly is : a fantastic Dynamic microphone with a SM58-like character that works for robust studio-recordings IF you have a high-quality high-gain preamp to use with it.Being a dynamic microphone, it does not have it's own preamp and is thus not as sensitive as a condenser mic. It's therefore not very useful for recording delicate singing voices, it's just not sensitive enough. But it will handle loud,screaming vocals easily, the capsule is robust enough to take in all that high energy. This is just the physics/science of microphones: dynamic mics handle loud sounds better, condensers handle delicate things better.But the SM7B is not like the Shure SM58 dynamic mic, it's capsule elements are thinner and much more sensitive, so it's sensitivity does lean towards the condensers, but being a dynamic mic this sensitivity comes at the expense of it only being able to produce a weak signal, so it needs a preamp with plenty of clean gain before the signal can be used.....if you really think hard about it, it is thus trying to be like a condenser mic, but whereas a condenser mic has a built-in preamp, this SM7B needs an external preamp! In-between, that's where it is.But the story gets more interesting. The SM7B has \"character\"... the audio pattern mimics the legendary SM58's presence-boosting curve, so the SM7B can give your recorded voice the classic Shure SM58 \"live\" character if you know how to use it right (though again you need to keep in mind that it's never going to be as delicate as a condenser mic, still if you know what you're doing you might find it a worthy trade-off to get great character with the loss of some delicate-ness. Post-recording engineering, a bit of compression and you're back in the game.)Misconception: There is a presence-boosting switch. Nope. What the switch does is take away the presence to give you a flat-response curve, i.e. in its natural state the presence is already boosted, the switch is misleading, the flat-response is the altered state.Misconception: The pop-filters (windscreens) provided give you a natural sound. No they don't. They filter off the high-frequencies, giving you a flatter sound. This is perfect for podcasting, and you can speak with your mouth close to the mic without having pops (use the thinner or thicker filter, depending on how robust your POP-ing is getting), but for singing you want to take off the windscreens, leave the metal grill exposed, and use a proper external POP filter.For recording of a singer, the magic comes with a proper external POP filter, no need for a super-expensive one, but one with at least a double-grille and larger (6inch minimum) diameter. Shure sells such a POP filter, good enough for the task. Once you're using a proper external pop filter, you can place it really close to the metal grille front, have your SM7B switches without bass-cut and with the presence-boost on (as I said it earlier this is actually a no-presence-cut position rather than a real boost)...and you can record your singing in all it's glory, your voice gets recorded as if you were winging with a Shure SM58 on steroids, i.e the \"character\" of the mic is there. There is no need to switch off this presence, you can always do so in the mixing stage. You thus end up recording with a high degree of sensitivity yet having a very low noise floor (the advantage of a dynamic mic).The is not much proximity effect with this mic, the metal grille extends far beyond the capsule element so your mouth cannot get really too close to the capsule. (Hats off to the Shure engineers for this bit of idiot-proofing). Imagine a super-sensitive SM58 with a Blues singer planting his lips of the grille and you're recording his voice in a studio, and you're in 'POP hell...now you appreciate the engineering :)Apologies for the lengthy review, but I do believe I've given an honest description of the important details. PODcast users may find this mic overkill but hey if you have the cash then flout it, though you could get the same audio with a cheap condenser with a big windshield and some EQ work. Recording vocalists with a more dynamic vocal range is where the SM7B will probably shine, and especially with louder vocalists, or for recording alongside other instruments being played simultaneously, where the bleed from other sounds is significantly reduced with such a cardiod-pattern dynamic mic.I'm very happy with this mic, have done tons of audio tests with it. I'll use it for my more rocking vocals, leaving the delicate ballads to a condenser mic. Hope this review helps you decide what's best for you, make the best use of your hard-earned $. Cheers.",

                "reviewText": "Beware:If there's anything I've learnt by using this mic is that it's not for everyone. Nor is it for anyone who understands it's purpose and how it works let alone the little caveats that come with it. This is a studio grade mic. It's expensive. It requires you to know what you are doing to set yourself up properly for your intended use. By no means this is an entry (plug and play) mic for anyone out there, even less so for anyone who intends to use it for commentary (looking mainly at all of you who want to make youtube videos and streams). Do keep in mind that this mic shouldn't ever be your first pick, not at this price point and not without a good knowledge because you will be disappointed.If your intentions are to do commentary and broadcast, there are far more affordable options that you can tweak to sound like this one.If your intentions are musically inclined then this may be a better option for you however not the first either.In any case keep in mind that this is a VERY quiet mic, it takes a good amp to drive it. It's not a plug and play mic, you have to EQ it to your intended use (not that you can't just use it as is, just won't give you the results you are seeking). It certainly is very pricey due to the quality, branding and popularity - there may be just as good options out there for you to look at.Actual review:I've tried and used a fair share of mics for various purposes and went up the ladder until I could finally buy this one. All I can say is that it's damn worth it. In the year or more I've had it, it served me fantastically and I genuinely can't find any complaints. When it comes to music, this thing makes all the instruments I've used pop which is a pleasure to listen to. Highly suggest this product but only if you read what I've said up there in the beware.",
