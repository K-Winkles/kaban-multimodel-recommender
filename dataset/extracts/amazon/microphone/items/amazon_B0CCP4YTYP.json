                "reviewText": "I recently bought this wireless microphone on Amazon for better audio quality for my content creation for $9.99 deal, and let me tell you, it's a game-changer for anyone on a budget!Pros:Sound Quality: Surprisingly crisp and clear! I tested it out while making my content\u2013 no complaints. Definitely exceeded my expectations at this price point.Wireless Range: Decent range for its size. I could move around without losing signal, which is perfect for those who like to groove while they work or present.Battery Life: Holds up well. I used it for a couple of hours without any issues. Just what you need for extended use without the hassle of constant recharging.Build Quality: Sturdy for the price. Don't let the low cost fool you; it feels more durable than expected. Good for regular use.Easy Setup: Took me literally seconds to connect to my device. No complicated instructions or technical hiccups. (A manual is still provided.)Cons:Design: It's a bit basic in terms of design, but hey, it's function over fashion, right? Personally I\u2019d like color choice as well. (Blue \ud83d\ude09)Accessories: Comes with the basics \u2013 no fancy carrying case or additional accessories. But again, for $9.99, it's a minor sacrifice.For the price, this wireless microphone is an absolute steal. It does exactly what it's supposed to do \u2013 delivers clear audio, hassle-free setup, and decent wireless range. If you're on a tight budget or just need a reliable backup, go for it. Is it a professional-grade mic? No. But does it get the job done without breaking the bank? Yes.",

                "reviewText": "The mic was use on an iphone 12pro. I rated a one star because i was hopefully the mic would be clear but the mic timbre sounded moufful, distant, and cover. No matter where i clip the mic on my shirt or on the table it does not sound smooth and clear as i expected. I already have an iphone wired mic which sounded way better than the wireless mic. It is clear and consistent. I guess you pay for what you get. Besides the mic quality, i like the friendly plug and play. You only need to charge the mic not the receiver.",
