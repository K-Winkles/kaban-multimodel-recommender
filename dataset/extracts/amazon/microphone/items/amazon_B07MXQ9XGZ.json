                "reviewText": "Not much to say, I had no issues with these workign from 50' away. Battery life is excellent. However there is noticable pickup of handling noise. Switch hands, can here it unless you are smooth with the hand off. The mute button on both type mics you can hear the click from pressing it.These are not deal breakers, and if it will be people who know about these, can minimize it (ie. for Mute, hold it in for about a split second, don't just do a quick push, this way you only hear the click of the button pressing in, and by the time it is popping back out, mic is already muted.The headset was suprisingly comfortable, very well balanced that you soon forget you are wearing it. If you are using for singing, you will notice a difference between the handheld and the headset, which is designed more for speach.The balance of the handheld mic took me a while to get used to, that and the \"feel of quality\" I don't think I would use it for something the \"general public\" would came up and used it, like karaoke. (definately not if you expect any \"mic drop\" people) Granted, my last DJ setup I had 10 years ago consisted of Seinheiser e835 corded mics and both a lapel and handheld version of Audio Technical 3000 series. Though, for the price difference, you could buy 5 of these units for what the AT systems were, (and boy have the gotten even pricier now). But for the price range, really great.I do want to see about buying a second handheld if I can set it to use the same recevicer as the body pack (granted not at the same time), and definately a set of color caps. Mine came with bright orange... what am I directing traffic? LOL",
