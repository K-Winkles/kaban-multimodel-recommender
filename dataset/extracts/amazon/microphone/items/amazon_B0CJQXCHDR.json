                "reviewText": "I just received my microphone today and they seem to work well enough. My problem is that I bought it for a personal amplifier that I wear and you can't get within 5 ft of the receiver unless you want horrible feedback. The microphone is also very sensitive, so the volume is super loud even with my amp turned all the way down. I imagine this would work well as long as your receiver is further away, if you're trying to use it for speakers at an event.There is also a delay which is kind of annoying, but the sound is still clear, besides the static and the background that doesn't change at all with the volume.It advertises that it has noise-cancelling, but it does not. Anything near the mic, it's going to pick it up. If you're trying to use this mic where other people might be talking or there might be background noise, this is not a good choice for you.",

                "reviewText": "This was an excellent purchase! I was looking to purchase a mic for a reasonable price, but also with good sound. This comes with everything that you need. It\u2019s great that it works alongside an iPhone, or an android. The puffs that come with it help tremendously with any background noise. I loaded a video, and as you can tell, I move the mic around on my sweater and it does not pick up any noise from the sweater at all, great product and highly recommend! I\u2019ve used other products, and I\u2019ve had to make returns for several different reasons. The charging is so easy, you can charge all three items at the same time for use. I\u2019ve gone as kind as three hours recording without them dying on me. Purchase and you won\u2019t be disappointed!",
