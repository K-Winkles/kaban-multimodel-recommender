Sound quality is clear enough, but because it's an entry level microphone do not expect super sharp or clear sound as you would from a higher end company like Shure. That said, for the price this will meet most amateur to semi-professional needs in my opinion.",

This is a great deal for just fartin around with friends.However, you will have to train up considerably to out grow this mic.Great entry level even to mastery.Has excellent sound rejection.Has very clean sound when directed into mic.I can yell, do rock, tenor songs, belters, and even impressions.I am on Smule and I can not believe the stinking quality.Lastly, my voice improved because I no longer need to push my voice so hard. It takes the smallest drip of sound. Peace",

                "reviewText": "I have been using this in my studio as a extra for guests when my compression microphones are all being used on my podcast (Studio B.E.E.) for about a year, arguably, maybe more. Have had no issues with this mic, works excellent, and is beyond worth the $$$$ depending upon what you are using it for.Personally, I would NOT use this for vocals (singing), or music, unless your budget is really tight. It may be great for recording high range instruments such a guitar, chimes, tambourines, ect..... but not low range such as a bass drum, or base guitar. I doubt it will do the lower range any TRUE justice, even though it may sound ok.However, it's a perfect starter or guest mic! Always good to have around \ud83d\udc4c \ud83d\ude0c.We bought it, and still use it next to our expensive microphones all the time.Not a bad Buy in our opinion!",

                "reviewText": "Took this out of the box and the weight surprised me. This thing is metal and has some heft to it. Feels good in the hand, very much like Sennheiser, AKG, EV, Shure etc. Comes with a mic clip and a long mic cable.The mic clip exhibits a little rubbery flex, a good thing, considering how easily cheaper clips break from being too brittle.The cable is female XLR on one end and 1/4\" unbalanced TS on the other. I wish both ends were XLR. Even more, I wish they were right angled XLRs.When are you getting in the right angle and low profile XLR game AMZ?The mic sounds fine. I plan to use it at events where people are making speeches. As a musician, I wouldn't exclude it from use as a vocal mic, in the absence of the ones I'm familiar with.One negative I notice, is that an Amazon Basics XLR does not 'click' on to this mic. While it does lock, I do not hear that confirmatory click I'm used to with my other mics.",
