With a 7 cm starting point and amazing range, the autofocus feature is able to ensure your videos are always sharp and crystal clear.

            "\u3010Built-in Microphone & Noise Cancellation\u3011 The built-in noise-canceling microphone reduces ambient noise to enhance the sound quality of your video. Great for Zoom / Facetime / Video Calling / OBS / Twitch / Facebook / YouTube / Conferences / Gaming / Streaming / Recording / Online School.",
            "\u3010USB Webcam Plug and Play\u3011 Plug and play, no additional drivers required. Ready to use in one minute or less with any compatible device. The convenient folding design allows you to easily take it anywhere, and the 6.5 ft (2 Meter) USB cord is long enough for any task. The mounting clip can be flexibly placed on any monitor / laptop / tripod / or any flat surface.",
            "\u3010Widely Compatible and Software Support\u3011The webcam can be compatible with the current popular video/meeting software. Compatible with Windows XP/7/8/10/11, Mac OS 10.6, Linux 2.6.24, Chrome OS 29.0.1547, Ubuntu Version 10.04 or above, and more.

                "reviewText": "Purchased this for a new PC, and the picture quality is excellent, a noticeable improvement from an old 720p camera. Field of view is wide, helpful for having more than one person in view on a call. Setup is a breeze - just plug it into a USB port, and open the camera app in Windows (11 in my case), or a video call app like Skype. There are controls for adjusting brightness, contrast, sharpness, and saturation available in the Settings app. There is no dedicated software suite of utilities that comes with the camera - all the controls are via Windows. Audio quality from the microphone seem very good based on a test call and a little video recording. The one feature missing is some form of zoom. This does not have optical or digital zoom. I knew this when I bought it, but in retrospect, it would be nice to have, so only for stars. The privacy cover is very basic, but functional. In any case, the camera works very well, is easy to use, and represents a good value. Recommended.",

                "reviewText": "Most webcams have poor quality video. This one is no exception but it can be made acceptable.SOFTWARE: Mentioned in the product manual but not on the product page you can get this camera looking acceptable by downloading the AmCap software from the internet just google \"nexigo amcap\". With the software you can control things like sharpness, saturation, and auto exposure. I recommend the settings below.You simply download, unzip the file and click on the amcap.exe file to change webcam settings. keep that .exe on desktop or wherever you want to access it quickly. The software doesn't install itself to windows so you can move it around. In the app you want to go to Options and Video Capture Filter.I recommend disabling \"auto exposure\" because you'll look over exposed. Then go to the Video Prod Amp tab and adjust the gamma up or down to affect your exposure. Also adjust sharpness because it needs it. Lastly you can play around with the other settings as you like but those three adjustments get me 90% of the way to a decent picture.Pros:It's a fine webcam and ,if you use the software, you can get it looking decent and the sound quality of the mic is better than most in that it's loud enough for just chatting but not good enough if you want to emphasize your voice in a youtube video or recording. The auto focus is really only useful if you occasionally move things up close to the camera for people to see close up, Otherwise auto focus is not useful but I do like it. Lastly the Field of view (fov) is pretty good at around 70-75 degrees. this is good for person to person calls and I'd actually prefer it be even less. Larger fov cameras (110 degrees and more) are prone to a fish eye effect at the edges of the screen and I personally don't want other viewers to see more of my room than I want them to. for larger groups you can always move a smaller fov back further pretty easily. Most Logitech webcams uses fov in the 78 degree range because it works.Cons: The software seems to forget it's settings so if you close zoom and Amcap you have to redo the settings again when you come back. At 1920x1080 view and even 1280x720 the video become very grainy and you can see a lot of noise in the video. For use on zoom and skype it won't matter as those services can barely record 1280 anyway and no one will notice.Overall:I am considering returning this for a better quality device. It does the job with a bit of tinkering and the auto focus and fov are nice but even with proper lighting it's difficult to have colors look natural.I do recommend this as a decent midrange webcam.",
