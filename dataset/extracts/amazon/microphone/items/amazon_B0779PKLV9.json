The noise cancelling is good, and the control knob lets you adjust your volume nicely. That's all there is to say really, it' s not perfect - but for the price I'm quite happy. :)",

                "reviewText": "So, I didn't expect a whole lot out of this mic. Given it said it has a wide pickup pattern, like you would want for a group, like in a conference room sitting around a table, I thought it would probably be a bit weak. Folks on zoom calls with me tell me that's not the case, that it sounds just fine, like I'm \"on the radio.\"I have done some test recordings and while it's no directional mic, it's actually pretty good for just me sitting at my desk doing zoom calls. In comparison recordings, sound was only slightly less strong than the \"gaming\" headset mic I was using before. Sound was a little different, slightly more distant though, again, not weak, but still good quality. I'm running my mic gain about 80% on the PC and it's fine, so I even had some room if I want to boost it a bit. If you consider the gaming rig puts the mic 3\" from my mouth and I sit this 2-2.5 feet away and it's only SLIGHTLY less strong, I'd say that's a definite win. I can move around, kick back in my chair, etc. and there is only a slight change in how I sound, although I use it in a very small home office with lots of 'hard' surfaces and without much in there to absorb sound, so others' experience in this regard may vary.I really like the mute button on the mic which allows me to keep the mic in the muted state unless I'm using it. On Zoom, I mute with the app, but not all apps have that. THe button has a nice positive click, not mushy or cheap feeling. The LED that shows green for live, red for mute is very helpful to know which state it is in.NO, it's not a $100 (... or more...) mic, but the build quality exceeded what I expected for this price point. The gooseneck is easy to bend, allowing you point point it where-ever, but it's firm and holds any position I've put it in just fine. USB cord is adequately long. The base is neither large nor heavy, but is very stable. I thought the blue LEDs on the top were trivial but as they are on all the time, turns out they are quite helpful to alert me right away if I accidentally pull the mic USB cable out instead of some other device I'm trying to unplug. Now I like them! It just worked, no drivers needed (using MX Linux).I bought this as a \"just try it out\" sort of purchase on a whim and I thought it might just be something I moved to one of our machines out in the house where we would use it doing video calls with family and I'd move up to something twice the price. But it turned out I REALLY like this mic! In fact, it has earned a spot in my tech inner-circle and is now part of my daily-use equipment and I haven't looked at mics since I bought it.If I need a second mic for me or one for someone else in the family, this will be a buy-again.-------------Update 3/2023: STILL going strong, great mic for the money. As I said I would ... buying another for my son.",

I don't know if this is an issue with the microphone, or something on my laptop. Each time I restart my laptop I have to make sure to go to the settings and adjust the volume level for the microphone, or no one can hear me if I make phone calls or use the microphone for a Teams call. I have two other microphones that I never have to worry about setting the volume level, which leads me to believe it might be something related to this specific microphone.",

                "reviewText": "I keep having to do recorded speeches for my homework assignments (my program is strictly online), so I need to be heard clearly to qualify for full credit. Problem is, I have an ittty bitty voice. Laptop controls don\u2019t help my volume. Desktop makes me sound tinny. Lapel mic made me sound distant, but clear. This latest assignment was worth a lot of points and I needed a mic fast (within hours) since the lapel mic didn\u2019t work out and I got the due date of the assignment wrong. This mic was $19 and arrived in maybe 5-7 hours I think. I wished it came in multiple light color options (I like all my gadgets to coordinate), but whatever. Did it work? After grinding out the PowerPoint, I plugged it in and spent a couple minutes reading through manual. Setup the mic in my settings per the manual and hit record\u2026 and it worked! I was actually able to record me at a louder volume! And here\u2019s the crazy thing. I have a neighbor who blasts his radio all afternoon to evening and there was nowhere in my house I could\u2019ve blocked out his music. I hoped he didn\u2019t play any MGK, Metallica, or 2Live Crew. It was just smooth sounds so far. Maybe it would sound like background music. The mic didn\u2019t even pick it up. I was congested and really self-conscious about my whistling nose. The mic didn\u2019t pick it up. I kept having fo swallow to moisten my throat. The mic didn\u2019t pick it up. Just me. Clear, smoothe, :-D and at a louder volume! I cannot recommend this microphone enough. I don\u2019t know anything about professional mics and directions, dust covered, or whatnot, but if you need a great affordable mic that helps with low speaking volume and fast, this one\u2026. THIS one.",
