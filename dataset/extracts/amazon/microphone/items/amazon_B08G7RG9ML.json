                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing vocal sound, sturdy, but touch controls need improvement - average WFH \"Zoom-dweller\" review",
                "reviewText": "I'll start right off by saying that the Shure MV7 is an excellent USB microphone, as the vocal clarity and general audio output are an (obvious) upgrade over your average laptop's internal mic. This is marketed as a podcast microphone, though even I am not one of the users in that camp. Instead, I just needed a quality USB microphone for both video conferencing meetings and to record lectures at my college. My previous USB mic was a Zoom H1 recorder, and after weeks of online meetings day in and day out, I started to realize how much better these meetings would go without being asked repeatedly by a coworker to repeat myself or intermittently telling me that they have a hard time hearing me. So by no means am I an audio engineer with enough knowledge for a deep critique on the MV7's audio output (I'll let the other Amazon reviewers handle that area!), but Shure's creators don't intend for this to replace their higher end mics, such as the SM7B. Despite the fact that there is an XLR connection here, the MV7 isn't meant for those trying to get perfect, industry studio-quality sound or music recordings, but that's the point. Instead, if you're needing a mic for podcasting, live-streaming, or surviving Zoom calls, this is one of the best options out there, with enough monitoring options and room for configuration to get the most out of this gorgeous piece of hardware.The whole construction of the mic, right down to the attached mounting bracket, feels incredibly sturdy and premium. Despite only a few days of usage as of writing this review, I have very little concern about its long-term durability. Even the back, metal-rimmed headphone jack port has better quality than what you'll find in most laptops these days (if they include one, of course). Knowing users may opt for a desk microphone arm stand, the included USB cables are thankfully long. When you plug it in via USB, it takes a few seconds to register on your computer each time; there's a row of green lights that breathe while this happens. As a small note, I plan to purchase an arm stand in the future, but for now I have an On-Stage desktop stand that fits perfectly with this mic. It's a simple stand, but I recommend it nonetheless.As I mentioned earlier, I can't speak to the nuances of the MV7's audio quality compared to those who've actually had experience in the studio or recorded with decent sound mixing knowledge. But from my perspective of being the average person working from home and having a day filled with online meetings and lectures, I'm very impressed with how my voice sounds from this mic. Not only does my voice sound crystal clear, but even the echoes bouncing from my high ceilings and the inevitable street noise from outside my window are nowhere to be heard when I record audio from the MV7. Vocals are top priority for this product, hence the brand's naming of this being a podcast microphone. I do agree with Engadget's Devinda Hardawar - one of the first tech writers who wrote about the MV7 - that the plosives, or the \"p\" sounds, don't sound as perfect as you'd hope compared to what you normally hear in broadcast audio vocals or some high-profile live streamers, but that could very well because of my own loud, bright voice. Likewise, an additional pop filter mask may alleviate this very minor distortion. The software Shure recommends you use is ShurePlus MOTIV, a desktop app available for free on their website. The desktop app is useful enough for users like me, as they include Auto Level settings, which includes configuring for vocal tone and adjusting for microphone position, and Manual settings that allow you adjust the audio gain, EQ, and amount of sound compression. You can save presets and, for macOS at least, the MOTIV app automatically recognizes the Shure MV7 device once you plug it into the computer. Those looking to configure every single frequency and fine-tune the settings even deeper should look beyond MOTIV. In the near future, I hope to update this review with more scientific audio tests, ones that include both USB and XLR output (I'm still looking for the right audio interface).If there's one gripe I have to make about the Shure MV7 so far, it's that I'm not a fan of the touch interface built on the mic. There were plenty of instances where I had to tap an icon or swipe the volume slider multiple times in order for it to respond. The buttons, themselves, also could be bigger, because they were small even for my slim fingers to tap without accidentally touching the adjacent volume slider too. Though not entirely bad, I question why Shure didn't just go with physical controls, such as the volume dial seen in the Blue Yeti Pro. Buttons, whether touch-enabled or physical, aren't exactly needed, since the aforementioned ShurePlus MOTIV app is available, and contains the same controls along with a whole lot more options. Even the location of the touch panel won't suit everyone. I imagine some users might be used to grabbing the middle of the mic to adjust the angle - and the middle just so happens to be where the touch panel is located. Fortunately, you can actually go without ever needing to use the controls if you end up not loving them like me: holding both the Mute icon and the Monitor mix icon for at least two seconds will lock the whole touch panel, indicated by a red light next to a lock icon on the same panel. Of course, it's a matter of successfully getting those two icons to respond first! Perhaps Shure may release firmware that improves these touch controls in the future.Everything else about the Shure MV7, though, is near-perfect. I think having a microphone like this for your computer really makes working with meetings from home much more manageable. The $249 price tag is a worthy investment and easily beats whatever laptop internal mic or cheap, uncomfortable headset you've been stuck with. I'll update this review as time progresses, but for now I give it my highest recommendation![An important warning when first unboxing: for me, the screws holding the mic to the mounting bracket were NOT tightly fastened out of the box. One could easily hold it by the bracket and unknowingly cause the mic to wobble out and drop. Hopefully this is not the case for everyone, but you should keep that in mind when before grabbing the mic from the packaging for the first time; hold it by the mic, not the bracket!]",

                "reviewText": "A friend and I have been talking about a podcast for years, long before we even knew what to call it. We still aren't there, but close enough to begin navigating the hardware and software. I did a lot research before landing on the MV7. The MV5C was a contender and I actually tried that one first \u2013 it is a fine mic but it was a bit too bright for me. I was sorely tempted to go for the SM7B, which has a stellar reputation (and a price tag to support that reputation.) Though the SM7B is nearly twice the cost of MV7, that fact alone did not steer me away -- I learned long ago that there is a cost for quality.In the end, my decision was based on three factors:1. The MV7 was largely designed from the SM7B's blueprint: While the MV7 does not deliver quite the same richness as its predecessor, these two mics are very similar \u2013 honestly, given the $150 difference, they are close enough for my ears. Furthermore, Garageband with a decent audio interface should be able to compensate for any shortcomings.2. Unlike the SM7B, the MV7 offers the flexibility of a digital (USB) or analog (XLR) connection: For me, this was a game-changer. For direct-to-computer connections, Shure provides a simple configuration app (\"MOTIV\") which provides some very cool configuration options (some of which are mentioned below.)3. Variable pickup range and direct headphone monitoring: While the SM7B is amazing, it requires the user to speak directly into the mic and maintain close range. The Shure MOTIV app delivers some powerful configuration options to create presets for near and far pickup (up to 18\" away). That means the mic can remain out of camera view for conference calls and still work really well. Plus, the built-in headphone monitor means you can hear yourself perfectly without the need to purchase additional hardware like an audio interface or headphone monitor.To summarize, at $249, the MV7 has inherited enough of the pro-level quality of the SMB7 to satisfy most podcasters. In addition, the MV7 offers some unique features that \"big sister\" cannot provide -- notably the dual USB and XLR output options and integrated headphone monitor. Singers may prefer to spend the extra money on the SMB7 but, for spoken voice, the MV7 is an all-one-powerhouse that's hard to beat.",

                "reviewText": "Night and day better than a different mic I had to return. The product is made of very sturdy material. Came with several attachments so I could hook it up to my mic stand. Also, the sound is bad if you don't understand the controls on the mic so read it and understand it before you write it off. You have to hold your finger on the buttons for two seconds to use some of the controls. So play around with it. Once you get it dialed in, it is fantastic and it cuts out all the background noise. The sound quality is amazing. For example, I had a lawnmower outside of the window and it was still recording perfect sound. I paired this with audacity and it works great. Also, one word of caution is that it doesn't come with a USB-C connection. It's an older micro USB connection but it still works well because that's what plugs into the mic end.",

                "reviewTitle": "Works great! Be careful with it. Temporary bad smell. Probable fixable issues with mic gain.",
                "reviewText": "Only problem I've noticed with this mic is settings-wise it can be a bit annoying getting the gain right, but just adjusting the settings in whatever software you're using if it ends up being too quiet isn't that big of an issue. I have a good boom arm for this (Rode PSA1+) which allows me to maneuver this mic anywhere I'd want practically and that might also be helpful in getting it positioned perfectly for your voice. IMPORTANTLY I know people have had problems with the micro USB port on the device, however, after about a month and a half I have not had this issue. My advice is that you will likely be fine assuming 1. You do not constantly plug/unplug the cable from that port. 2. You are careful when touching that part of the cable to not be too rough. 3. You leave some slack in the cable (specifically RIGHT behind the mic before it snakes up your boom arm) because if the cable is too tense then it could cause the plug to push more into one side of the interior of the port than it ought to.In summary, take precautions, be careful when moving it (NEVER grab it by the cable when moving it, grab onto the microphone or better yet the boom arm) and also be careful plugging/unplugging it, a good boom arm is advisable for a good mic, also the gain can be an issue but there are many ways to adjust that either in software or moving the mic closer perhaps or whatever is needed.The quality of the sound is excellent. My old microphone was a HyperX Solocast and for me I felt like it had a problem with sibilance sounds (i.e. 'S' sounds coming through poorly), but the Shure MV7 has no problem with sibilance or plosives from my experience (might vary for other setups I am sure, but for me it is solid).Probably the best option unless maybe you can afford a mega expensive Shure SM7B setup and all the stuff it requires, but if you want a mic that can plug into a USB of your computer and the Shure MV7 is affordable enough then just be careful and go for it. (Side note: I heard you can improve the MV7 quality even more by separately buying a SM7B-style microphone cover and putting it on instead. Haven't tried it myself, but seems like it would work as far as I can tell.)OH! Also it should be noted that when you receive this microphone it will have an awful chemical-like smell at first, but do not worry. Just let it air out in a room or something. The smell should go away in a day or a few days. It's only temporary. Not sure what causes the smell, probably something with how it is packaged.I've gone over a few problems in this review, but none of them stop me from giving this microphone a 5/5 because all of its problems have solutions I find. Also the mic quality is amazing once you mess with its settings.I've included a picture to show roughly how you should have the mic's cable be not too tight. (As you can see, if it was too tight here, the cable would be pulled up and thus the end of the cable inside of the mic would try to do the same meaning the end of it would be pressing down against the lower part of the port inside the mic. Having it loose means the cable is straight as it enters the mic, and thus because it is not entering the port at an angle is not really pushing against any areas against the inside of the port. Now, I probably do not need quite this much loose cable, but just make sure the thick end of the cable going into the mic is straight and probably also at least a tiny bit of the cable that is behind the wider and thicker end. This will also probably make it easier the unplug and make unplugging it less risky.)",
