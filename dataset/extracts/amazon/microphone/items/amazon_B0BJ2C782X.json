                "reviewText": "The microphone was easy to set up. The extra pop screen was bought separately. My desk has a barrier that blocks the turn handle on the latch. Not really an issue just be aware of that if you're working in tight spaces. The setup itself is very easy and its nice that it comes with a usb-c adapter and iphone adapter so that you can use it with multiple devices. Once you connect you just go to your audio settings and set the input to the microphone and you are good to go. Very user friendly setup. At higher volumes there is a noticeable echo but that was not helped by the fact I'm operating in a corner space with no sound mitigation. Looking at other reviews though this is a common complaint. This is easily fixed by bringing down the volume of the microphone though and the echo completely goes away. Im writing this review just a couple days after using the product so can never be totally sure about the longevity, however I'm not worried about it because the microphone comes with a lifetime warranty and other reviews regarding their customer service seem to be on point. At the pricepoint it is a solid value.",

The microphone with lightning adapter is not tested on Apple products. It has an \"echo\" controller on the microphone. Would work pretty well for podcast production. With an arm stand the upper part of the microphone would reach up to 35.82 inches (91 cm) high. In terms of the warranty, it is indicated on the cable \"lifetime warranty\", but in the pamphlet it is noted \"12 months\". The weight of the microphone (with foam windscreen) + arm stand + table clamp + main cable (USB A to type C) + USB A to type C adapter makes 26.8 oz. (760 g).",
