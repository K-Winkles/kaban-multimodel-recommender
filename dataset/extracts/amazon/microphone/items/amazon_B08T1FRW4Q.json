                "reviewText": "Can confirm - works on many (NOT ALL) apps on iPad Pro 2020 if using the Apple usb C multiport digital adapter hub. The adapter costs $69 so I use the Insignia brand for $35 instead, which works great. A regular adapter might work too but not sure.It automatically works when recording video or GarageBand audio just fine. But I really wanted to try it for calls.On iPad Pro: it works with Zoom and Bluejeans. It did not work on MS Teams or Google Hangouts.Everything works normal on PC.Build: Feels sturdy. Base is big and heavy plastic with a volume knob and mute button. Wire seems fine. Goose neck is bendable at the base, stiff in the middle and bendable near the end. Longer than I expected. Easy to adjust.Sound: Picks up a lot if volume knob is turned all the way up, in addition to background noises. I find anything above 50% gets way too distorted and has a slight hiss in the background bc it gets too sensitive and picks up every sound in the room (ac or fan or echoes). My ideal range is 30-40% volume as it keeps the voice audible without distortion and cuts out background noise. I keep the mic 6-12 inches back for best results, which also leaves it out of the video. It doesn\u2019t have the rich timbre of a blue yeti, yet it is more clear than the muffled sounding blue snowball. Has a slight background hiss compared to the blue yeti, but only noticeable if you are listening for it, and the hiss sounds quiet compared to the Blue snowball. Though it has a foam cover, plosives still make its way through. May have to invest in the world\u2019s tiniest pop filter.Because of the balance of features and price, I think it\u2019s near perfect for video conferencing. Personally I wish it was a bit smaller to make it more portable, and/or that it had a headphone jack. As far as quality and functionality, I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "My experience with audio recording equipment is vast. I am an audio production specialist for multiple media groups, and have extensive knowledge on just what to look for when it comes to picking up a piece of recording gear.Typically, 30 dollars doesn't get you very far in this department. However, I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt that the K052 has blown that assumption out of the water.Though the K052 isn't, by any means, a piece of professional recording gear, it will take you incredibly far in the world of entry level recording. It has an incredibly level sound profile, with a slight emphasis on the low end that is perfect for voice over. The included pop filter does an incredible job of catching any imperfections that may occur, and the mic's small profile allows it to be placed virtually anywhere. The incredible length of the cable and the super flexible gooseneck helps this aspect immensely.More so, the build quality of this mic is absolutely incredible! Fifine spared no detail on the body of this piece of gear, with the hefty base sporting heavy duty plastic and metal. To top it off, the mic has a tactile mute button and a super convenient in-line volume knob.It still blows me away that this mic is less than 30 dollars. For this price, you are getting above and beyond what you paid for, as is expected of a company like Fifine. I would happily purchase a product from them in the future.If you would like, please check out my youtube review (/c/hammyplays) for loads more information on this piece of gear. Thank you!",

It's sound quality is like a normal wired earphone's mic quality & if you have a lot of background noise you better lower the dB value in the settings around 18 or so. I would suggest you can get the same quality of mic with lower price so go for that.",
