                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Almost as clear as my professional studio microphone.",
                "reviewText": "As a non-gamer, I bought this for video voice overs, skype, podcasting and for use with my video camera. Now, I think this won't work with my DSLR or Canon Vixia video camera, because they require a \"line level\" input from a powered microphone such as the Vid-Pro lavalier microphone sold on Amazon, which takes a button cell battery and has a tiny amplifier in it.Cons:The 1/8\" Y cable that comes with this is terrible. It plugs in very tight, and will never come out. But it feels permanent, once plugged in, and barely comes back out. I felt like I might break the cable trying to remove the 2 little 90 degree plugs from my computer. I would suggest buying a new headset microphone adapter Y cable, for $5 on Amazon that has straight plugs. The cord is nice and braided which feels nice, but it does create a little bit of noise when you brush it against a zipper on a sweater or coat. Not a big deal. The microphone picks up a very slight echo speaking into my custom cubicle style work desk, unless I turn it so the microphone holes are facing up and down, which completely removes any echo. The microphone won't work with my Scarlett preamp designed for large professional microphones.Pros:This V-Moda microphone sounds more clear and accurate than a professional XM8500 stage microphone I recently purchased, which sounds very dense, muffled and muddy in comparison to the V-Moda microphone. After seeing how tiny the V-Moda was, holding it in my hand, I was extremely skeptical that it could reproduce the Human voice properly without seriously distorting the frequency and tone like many other tiny non-powered microphones or cheap headset microphones.Well, the V-Moda BoomPro is not an ordinary cheap microphone. It was engineered by real sound engineers, because it blocks background sound better than my $100 studio microphone, and sounds almost as clear. The V-Moda is more a bass and mid range microphone, picking up the lows very well, without picking up the really low lows that cause distortion and muddiness. It seems to have just the right frequency response for picking up the Human voice. It does not pick up the ultra low rumbling frequencies or the ultra high shrill background noises. Somehow, the itty-bitty tiny little microphone that is nearly invisible, it records big booming sound, and reproduces my speaking voice with clarity and authority.The V-Moda is worth every penny, because it is as good as advertised.Observations and Technical Breakdown:The V-Moda doesn't reproduce the Human voice accurately. None of the microphones I've ever used sound totally natural. Microphones convert your voice into an electronic signal, so there will always be some kind of coloration of the tone of your voice, music recorded in the background, etc. The V-Moda is a little bit heavy in the low mid range area, and a little light in the high end frequency spectrum. It's designed intentionally this way to prevent background noise and to prevent shrill unnecessary high pitched sounds from being picked up by the microphone. I am perfectly happy with the sound tone of the V-Moda for Skype calls and phone calls, as it's nearly perfect. Using default settings, the V-Moda sounds more clear and less muddy than my Behringer XM8500 microphone, which was pretty shocking considering the size difference. I've heard many small microphones that sound so muffled and terrible that they are mostly useless .The V-Moda sounds very similar to my inexpensive studio microphone, an AKG P120 condenser microphone, which uses 48 volts and a preamp, a Scarlett 2i2 2nd generation.For video voice over work, the V-Moda is too mid-bass heavy for my taste. Surprisingly the V-Moda microphone seems to automatically block out frequencies below 100hz, preventing any heavy bass noises from ruining the sound. But if you want your voice to sound absolutely natural, you'll need to do some editing in a sound editor or use some kind of an equalizer. This is for people who are using this to make professional recordings. Now, again I was skeptical that this microphone could be good enough to make a professional recording. But indeed it can. You will need to do a little editing. I'll tell you how I was able to do it.First, you'll need a new computer sound card. Unless you you have a really good internal sound card in your computer, or a professional recording studio, you might get too much line noise from the cheap internal microphone port on your laptop or computer. Every computer is different. However, my laptop and my PC computer both have a lot of line noise when I use a microphone on the factory microphone input jack. I tried using the V-Moda on a Sound Blaster Audigy sound card and there was absolutely no audible line noise or hissing. This is called signal to noise ratio. Add-on sound cards that you purchase separately may be better than the internal sound card, so if you get line noise, I would recommend either buying a Sound Blaster Audigy (Open your computer and check for open PCI & PCI express slots). They make PCI or PCI Express sound cards. Or you can get a USB sound card. I found a really good PCI sound card that also doubles as a professional headphone amplifier. It's called the ASUS Xonar DG 5.1 Channels PCI Interface Sound Card. You can get it here on Amazon: http://amzn.to/2AVdJQmThis ASUS DG sound card is designed for headsets, it has a very high signal strength so it doesn't have any line noise, and it has a built in amplifier to power expensive headphones. People report a noticeable improvement using this sound card with headphones. The ASUS DG sound card actually has an adjustable output for different types of headphones, so it can work with cheap headphones or professional 600 ohm headphones which usually require an expensive external headphone amplifier. You can configure it for different headphone OHM ratings. I've never seen this feature on any other sound cards, especially internal factory sound cards.Sound Editing:Back to the V-Moda microphone. What makes a good microphone good is it's ability to maintain the information being recorded. If you lose certain frequencies or distort the voice too much, you cannot use sound editing to fix the sound. No amount of editing can fix a bad microphone, because the sound is lost before it gets recorded. The V-Moda handles sound editing extremely well. Again, I was shocked. It's not as good as my AKG P120, but it's close enough after editing, that no normal person would ever notice a difference. The V-Moda does cut off a lot of the high frequencies and it does boost some of the low-mids, naturally, due to its design. You won't be able to magically recreate the missing high frequency sounds, but for voice recordings, that's perfectly fine and even desired in most situations. High frequency sounds are rarely desired in voice recordings, and the most popular radio broadcast microphones today have a sound tone that is very similar to this V-Moda microphone, with muted treble.The V-Moda does't have an absolutely accurate sound tone, it sounds a little bit amplified in the mid bass area, but with some sound equalizer adjustments in a sound editor program, you can make the tone sound more natural, just by reducing some of the mid bass. If you just get a free program like Audacity, then you can record your voice, then edit the sound using the built in equalizer to get the exact sound you want. I am convinced that the V-Moda records with enough quality that you can safely edit the sound recording without losing a significant amount of the audio integrity.In conclusion:The V-Moda sounds slightly muted, slightly muffled, and slightly boosted in the lower-mid bass region. But it appears to be perfectly tailored to picking up the Human voice, and blocking out things happening in the background. It's obviously a very carefully engineered microphone, and is shockingly good for the price. Unlike other microphones which sound wretched and painful to the ears, this V-Moda microphone has a very smooth, very warm sound tone, that is very clear. I am so happy to know that engineers actually engineered this microphone, unlike 99% of the other microphones out there in this price range which appear to be random accidents, and have no ability to recreate the Human voice.You'll need sound editing to remove some of the mid-bass in order to make this microphone record more accurately, but with some sound editing, I think you can make this microphone sound good enough that you won't need to ever buy a more expensive professional grade microphone. I would consider this a professional microphone for home users and hobbyists. If you need something better than this, than I would suggest getting a dynamic microphone like the Shure SM57 with an extra heavy duty gray foam wind sock, a Shure SM7, or an AKG D5. Then you'll need a preamp like a Scarlett 2i2 USB, and a 15 foot XLR microphone cable. If you need super fine sensitivty and detail, then purchase a 48 volt powered condenser microphone like the AKG P120, and a microphone stand with a boom arm on it, then you can hear a pin drop, literally.You'll want to buy a Sound Blaster Audigy or the ASUS DG sound card if you are using a PC computer, if you hear too much white noise in the background in your recordings. Start first by turning down the gain, and looking for updated drivers for your factory sound card.Edit: 11/23/2017I received my Asus Xonar DG sound card for my 5 year old motherboard with a PCI slot on Windows 7. The sound card microphone input jack used with the V-Moda BoomPro is absolutely crystal clear, without a trace of any line noise or white noise. This V-Moda microphone sounds even better now, more natural sounding, and even more clear. I am shocked at how much better a $30 sound card can make the microphone sound. If you are having sound issues or having too much line noise, or not enough gain, try getting a new sound card.V-Moda vs. Golden Age Project D2 microphone. I bought a new dynamic professional microphone and tested it against the V-Moda yesterday. The Golden Age Project D2 sounds much worse than then V-Moda BoomPro. The same for the XM8500, which sounds much worse, but better than the D2. Again, I am so surprised. The D2 microphone was $150, but it sounds like you are speaking into a plastic bucket, compared to the natural clarity of the V-Moda. The V-Moda so far, sounds better than 2 other non-powered microphones I've tried which are far more expensive. The ASUS sound card is not perfect, it has caused my computer to lock up a few times with a blue screen, if I try to use my Scarlett Focusrite at the same time, to record multiple devices at the same time. It also takes a moment to begin recording when you engage the sound card, because it has to charge up the capacitors. The Asus sound card software allows you to do realtime \"EQ\" adjustment of your microphone input, and it sounds excellent, with an improvement in the high frequency response of the Vmoda mic, which, for the price of the sound card ($30) is truly amazing. With the treble turned up, the Vmoda sounds even more clear and crisp.Conclusion: Get a new computer sound card, and don't worry about buying a professional condenser or studio microphone. Get the V-Moda.",

                "reviewText": "This review is intended for GAMERS, so if your looking at this mic for other purposes, you may be better off reading another review. That said, I have the UE 6000 headphones, which are Apple ready, and wanted to use them for online gaming and chat on xBox One online. Because the UE 6000s are Apple-ready, the inline mic will NOT work due to ground and mic rings on the jack being flipped from the \"standard\" used in the xBox One headset adapter. But, using this mic with the UE 6000s WORKS PERFECTLY!! This cord will work with ANY Apple based headphones (so long as your headphone cord is detachable).The cord is of impressive build and performance quality! Other player's voices are clear (limited by your headphone quality of course), and everyone you're talking to will hear you clearly. Nobody has complained about the quality of this mic. The mic receives sound on both sides, so it's basically \"reversible\", which means it doesn't matter if your cord plugs into the L/R side of your headphones. As for the mic stem, it's perfect! Very flexible, and will retain whatever shape you place it in. It's lightweight, so it's not going to fatigue the wearer after long term use. And the max volume while playing online is LOUD (though this may be attributed to the UE 6000s). Many people have complained of low volume while using the headset adapter with whatever headset they're using. The quality of the cord exceeds the $30 cost, so it's a value purchase. Rather than buying a new set of Turtle Beaches, Trittons, etc, this mic's value becomes an even greater value.***- The xBox One Headset Adapter is a MUST! This cord will not bypass the need for the adapter.Because this cord wasn't designed exclusively for gaming, the cord is on the long side (6ft long). However, it does come with a velcro strap to tie the cord and shorten it. It's a solid solution, or you could just use a twist-tie for the same purpose. The only slight complaint that could be made about this mic is that if you rub it, you'll hear some SLIGHT muffling in your headphones. But, you only really notice it if there's no sound coming through the headphones. When playing, I never noticed any sound interference at all.Rather than buying the Polk 4-Shot gaming headset for $160, or the XO Sevens for $135, I'd strongly recommend this alternative for the same price- this V-Moda mic ($30), the xBox One Headset Adapter ($25), and the UE 6000 headphones. As of 3/26/2014, these headphones are listed on Amazon for $80 (in white), and $100 (in black). I did a side-by-side comparison with Beats Studio, and these 6000s sounded better/clearer with just as much bass if you wanted. Plus, you can then use these headphones \"on the go\" unlike turtle beaches, tritons, etc. And their build quality is far superior to the Polk and others.In conclusion, this mic is perfect for turning ANY pair of detachable cord headphones into a gaming headset when used with the xBox One Headset Adapter. The construction and performance are top notch, and the mic stem is highly customizable. If you already have a quality pair of headphones that you feel would make a great gaming headset, then buying this mic is a no-brainer. If you don't already have a quality pair, it's worth your time and money to put together a gaming headset using this mic. And if you go this route, start by looking at the UE 6000s!!",

                "reviewText": "I initially bought these for my Astro A40's because the microphone is horrible. Turns out the A40's don't work because Astro decided to use a longer 5 pole 3.5 jack which didn't work with this product. A shame I couldn't find an adapter either. So instead I am temporarily using the mixamp with the original Skullcandy Crusher wireless. I tried using the Crusher ANC, but the 3.5 jack is on the right side of the headphones and I didn't like having to rotate the microphone boom like that. The jack fits nicely though, it doesn't feel loose and it doesn't swing around. So far the sound quality is good, it does utilize the bass drivers in the Crushers. I mainly bought these because the microphone is incredible. Most programs I use such as Discord or Xbox party chat have filtering, but it does let a lot of background noise through normal voice recordings.Here are my cons so far: The braided cable makes a lot of noise and transmits into the microphone which can be heard with Astro's sidetone (feature that lets you hear yourself) enabled. There is no indicator when you are muted. The mute slider is not that good, I thought the logo was a giant mute button. You have to use a stand or be careful while laying your headphones down as this mic doesn't flip up or retract. There is some hiss noise at higher volume. The boom arm doesn't seem to have a lot of retention to hold it's position, might be an issue in the future.",
