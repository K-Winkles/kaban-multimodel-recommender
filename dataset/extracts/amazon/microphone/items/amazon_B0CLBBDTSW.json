Microphone Boom Arm The adjustable studio boom arm clamps securely to desks, tables and other flat surfaces up to 55 mm (2.2\") thick. Offering full 360\u00b0 rotation and adjustable, spring-stabilized joints, the boom arm repositions quickly for optimal mic placement. Pop Filter The pop filter built with dual layer screen pop filters blocks air blast as normal one layer filter usually does. The gap in between disperses any remaining air pressure. After the sound passes the second screen, the blast is heavily contained to produce great sound recording quality. AT8458 Shock Mount & Bag The AT8458 Microphone Shock Mount effectively attenuates noise, shock, and vibration transmitted through mic stands, booms, and mounts. It's easy to install and adds the total package of unbeatable sound. It is compatible with 3/8\"-16 and 5/8\"-27 threaded stands.",

                "reviewText": "I lucked out when I bought this microphone, as it was only $70 and was practically new. And I can honestly say, it was worth every penny, and then some.First things first, as this IS a condenser microphone, you HAVE to give the room you plan to record in proper treatment. Otherwise it WILL pick up a lot of reverb and background noise. I have actually surrounded the microphone itself with studio foam inside of a cardboard box. It's not the prettiest sight, but it was inexpensive and works just as well as the upwards $100 screens they sell for these.Another thing to remember is to buy a proper interface for this. Especially if you are recording on a PC. I suggest using a Line 6 Pod Studio UX1, I managed to find one of those on eBay for about $45. It has an excellent noise gate with it that filters out the background noise in real time, without giving the vocals that robotic sound that noise removal in post tends to leave.Please note, the UX1 does not supply phantom power, so you will need a phantom power supply. I use a Behringer Micro power supply P5400 with it ($20). You will also need to buy at least two XLR cables, one for the power supply, and one to connect to the interface, but you can find some decent ones around $7 -$14, so that is no big deal.As for the sound quality, it is PHENOMENAL. Every syllable comes out clearly, and distinctly. Subtle nuances in tone that some lesser mics tend leave out are crystal clear, and, best of all, it can handle high vocals without peaking as easily like my other microphones did. I managed to go to ear piercingly high pitches, and still managed to keep it from peaking.If you want high quality, professional sound, and don't feel like spending over $300, this is definitely the microphone to get.",

                "reviewText": "If you\u2019re looking to capture podcast style audio, this is the microphone that you should be looking at. Of course, when you look at the videos of all the big Podcasters and they\u2019re using the shure microphones, it seems tempting to just get one of those microphones. But take it from a person who\u2019s been in the entertainment industry for over 40 years unless you are a true audiophile, you will not hear the difference. This is a brilliant condenser microphone that if used properly in the proper setting is absolutely brilliant you will not use this microphone to capture audio for a feature film. You will not use this microphone in a concert setting you will use this microphone in online meetings, recording a podcast or any other environment where you need your microphone to pick up your voice and somewhat ignore the rest of the noise in the room. There\u2019s lots of tacky stuff that goes into microphones and you can see some of it in the listing but in the end your question is, does this sound as good as a $600 microphone to 98% of the population it does, and until you can develop an ear that tells you the difference between that and this\u2026 just buy this.A couple things you should know. This is not a USB microphone. It uses phantom power the an XLR cable in other words you\u2019ll need an interface that can supply that 48 V power to the microphone you will not be able to plug this in to your laptop and record, you can pick up an interface rather inexpensively.All in all, it may have the price of a mid tier microphone, but its performance is surprising. As I said, in the title, you should consider this microphone, but I will amend it here. You should SERIOUSLY consider this microphone.",

Cabe mencionar que he probado los micr\u00f3fonos: shure pga27, behringer B2 pro, neet worker bee, at 2020, behringer c3, entre otros. Y realmente ten\u00e9 cosas m\u00e1s destacables en cuanto a sonido que estos antes mencionados, hace un excelente trabajo cancelando el ruido de fondo, adem\u00e1s su nivel de ruido propio es muy bajo por su precio, a comparaci\u00f3n del B2 de behringer que tiene un ruido propio muy alto. Su sonido vocal es excelente, s\u00faper neutro, natural y con el cuerpo que le da ese toque \"profesional\" que no tiene el AT2020, unos agudos s\u00faper ricos sin llegar a ser sibilante como el pga27 (qu\u00e9 adem\u00e1s suena muy pesado). He hecho pruebas con el de saxof\u00f3n, guitarra, guitarra amplificada, arm\u00f3nica, voces y su sonido en todos casos me ha convencido, adem\u00e1s que tiene un pad de -10 db para fuentes sonoras muy altas y otro low cut lo que se agradece para grabar instrumentos.Realmente lo recomiendo como primera opci\u00f3n sino tiene un presupuesto bastante elevado pero tampoco muy m\u00ednimo, tal vez y se ahorre muchas horas buscando el micr\u00f3fono de entrada ideal para su Home Studio.

                "reviewText": "Una Joya de Audio-Technica: El AT2035 no es solo otro micr\u00f3fono de condensador cardioide; es una muestra de lo que Audio-Technica hace mejor: calidad y rendimiento superior. Desde el momento en que lo sacas de la caja, el dise\u00f1o est\u00e9tico y la construcci\u00f3n s\u00f3lida te dicen que est\u00e1s ante algo especial.Sonido de Alta Fidelidad: Lo que realmente distingue al AT2035 es su capacidad para capturar sonidos de forma natural y con bajo ruido, algo esencial tanto para grabaciones de estudio como para actuaciones en vivo. Su gran diafragma juega un papel crucial aqu\u00ed, asegurando una captura de sonido uniforme y detallada.Versatilidad y Control: Este micr\u00f3fono maneja altos niveles de presi\u00f3n sonora (SPL) con una facilidad impresionante, lo que significa que puedes grabar una amplia gama de fuentes sonoras sin distorsi\u00f3n. El filtro pasa alto conmutable y el atenuador de 10 dB son detalles que brindan un control fino sobre la grabaci\u00f3n, permiti\u00e9ndote adaptarte a cualquier situaci\u00f3n.Aislamiento Superior: El patr\u00f3n polar cardioide minimiza la captaci\u00f3n de ruidos no deseados, enfoc\u00e1ndose en la fuente de sonido frente al micr\u00f3fono. Esto, combinado con el soporte de amortiguaci\u00f3n asegura grabaciones limpias y profesionales.Conclusi\u00f3n: El Audio-Technica AT2035 sobresale en todos los aspectos importantes: calidad de sonido, versatilidad, dise\u00f1o y accesorios. Si buscas un micr\u00f3fono que eleve tus grabaciones o actuaciones en vivo, este es definitivamente el camino a seguir. Una inversi\u00f3n que vale cada centavo, recomendado sin reservas para cualquier entusiasta del audio que busque excelencia sin compromisos.",
