                "reviewText": "I do professional commercial voice-overs, and was stunned by the quality. True 20-20khz frequency range, without the \u201cmud\u201d in the 500hz range. True cardiod front-facing pickup. Works best with only included windscreen and working 6\u201d from mic. Whisper or shout, and it digitally processes wonderfully. See pic for setup, and well modulated, even delivery on the wave of the audio recording software, after recording. I do slightly tweak the EQ, compression & add limiter to suit my needs per type of commercial read. Compactly replaced my previous pro XLR ribbon mic, tube Pre-amp, without losing the warmth.Headphone output lets you hear yourself, while recording.Truly plug & play, no need to download a driver. Note: At one point after year in use, mic driver became \u201cunavailable.\u201d Just a Windows & Dell update needed corrected.",
