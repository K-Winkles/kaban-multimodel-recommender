LED on when muted versus LED on when unmuted) is configurable via a firmware update. Please visit our support page for the appropriate firmware update for your microphone. Which third party boom arms / mic stands can be used with the SoloCast? The SoloCast comes with a built-in dual threaded mount hole allowing for use with both 3/8\" and 5/8\" thread sizes, accomodating most mic stands / boom arms on the market. How long is the USB cable that comes with the SoloCast? The included cable is 2 meters (~6.5 feet) in length, USB C on the side of the microphone and USB A on the system side. Is there a way to keep the SoloCast muted between system restarts or default it to mute? The SoloCast will default to be unmuted when it first turns on. The mute status is not stored within the microphone, so it resets on power loss. This can also occur when the system enters Sleep, depending on how your system is configured. Is the SoloCast compatible with Xbox systems? The SoloCast is not compatible with Xbox systems. The SoloCast is officially compatible with PC, PS4, PS5, and MacOS systems.",

                "reviewText": "It's the best microphone I've ever had. I will never buy another microphone again. I never liked standalone mics because they either looked junky or took up too much space but this microphone makes my desk look fancier and just cleaner in general. I've bought a binaural headset from this company before and loved that as well but the mic wouldn't pick up me singing because it was meant for gaming. This microphone picks up every hum sound I make but doesn't pick up my keyboard (unless the sensitivity is up too high). It also picks up from far away I can be across the room and people will still be able to hear me. The microphone quality is honestly amazing especially for the price. I'm also in love with the mute button sensor. Just a tap and it turns my microphone off completely. I never had a single problem with the microphone randomly leaking my voice at all which is great. I don't have a single complaint about this microphone at all. The cord is also long enough to be able to reach the lower usb ports on my pc which I was slightly worried about so if you have a setup the cord length will not be an issue. I'm very happy with this microphone :)",

                "reviewText": "This microphone is amazing for its price. It feels very premium and weighs quite a lot for its size. It has a touch sensitive button for muting and unmuting with a corresponding red light on the front of the mic to indicate if it\u2019s muted or not. The top half of the microphone is made out of metal which makes it premium to the touch. It also uses USB Type C technology for the output which is great to see on these types of products. If your using the cables that comes with it make sure it isn\u2019t by something that emits strong wireless signals. For example if it\u2019s by a router, it will interfere with the cable and cause a weird noise in your audio.The mic it self sounds amazing. The microphone does pick up a good amount of background noise so please keep that in mind. If you are gonna pick this microphone up I recommend getting a boom arm for better voice pickup and getting a free software like VoiceMeeter that can make the mic sound even better. It will make it sound like a podcast mic and get rid of the background noise. I would also consider getting the Hyper-X software for it.",

You might have to change your input device for audio if you are on pc but idk if you have to on Xbox or PlayStation because I got it for pc but you might have to for pc. If the light in the mic is red than you are unmuted and if it is off then you are muted. There is a mute button for it on the top of the mic is how you mute. For further instructions read the manual.",

                "reviewText": "With its price tag you wouldn\u2019t expect the greatest quality. I am pleasantly surprised. This mic doesn\u2019t have the features you\u2019d get in most mics but for what it does it\u2019s an exceptional job. I really like hyper x\u2019s idea in stripping down a mic to its basic purpose for budget friendly mics. I\u2019ve had compliments of people who have 200 dollar mics and asking how much I spent on it. You\u2019ll need a bit of software tweaking for stuff like streaming (equalizers compressors blah blah blah). I would 100% recommend this to my friends as a budget friendly mic. It doesn\u2019t sound or feel cheap at all. The touch to mute is something I really love. I use a pop filter on this because it does pick up some background noise. The multi threaded mount makes it so much easier in picking a mic stand due to it supporting different kinds. All in all, good sound quality, mountability, easy to use, and durable (I\u2019ve had this for over a year without damage). When I say durable I say this in the mindset of treating a mic properly. I have dropped this a few times had a water bottle leak on it and it surprisingly still works just as fine. Normally I\u2019d ask for more features but I understand the purpose of keeping the price tag down. So for it\u2019s purpose I rate this 19 compliments out of 5 vrchat buddies",
