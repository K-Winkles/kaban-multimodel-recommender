                "reviewText": "The blue snowball is a great microphone for anyone who is looking to talk online via discord, skype, or even voice chat in game. I personally use it to talk on discord with buddies, and record my YouTube videos.This thing starts working the second you plug in the USB cable, and the simplicity of just plug in and start talking, is really great. No software needed, no browsing set up guides, no fuss, just plug and play.The voice quality is perfect for this budget and price range. My voice will still get picked up even if I'm leaning back in my chair, or if I step away from my computer to pick up something in the room. It is definitely an upgrade compared to my last microphone, which was my laptops included microphone that would always pick up the laptop fan, and wouldn't grab my voice unless I spoke directly into it.Finally the size of the snowball is fantastic. Even when only mounted on the included tripod it doesn't take up much space on my desk, and is out of the way enough to not bother my gaming experience.If you need a microphone for gaming, recording, or just talking to friend online, this is a fantastic option for the price, and you will not regret buying this at least as your first microphone.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I've had this microphone only for about 3 weeks, but so far I love it. I recently started aYoutube channel and this is perfect for my voice overs and even recording my voicefor music. (I'm a creative goof, so I am recording food remixes to my favorite songs LOL) I am sure there are better ones out there for music, but this mic is fabulousfor the person looking for an intro mic that does a fabulous job. I wasn't down to spend $100on a microphone just to do voice overs. I don't have another mic to compare it to, but honestlydon't think I'll ever need one if this one lasts. I did buy a pop filter for this mic and do notice the differencein recording quality. The distortion goes way down if I'm singing loudly into the mic with the pop filter.In other words, buy it. It's affordable and does the job well.**3 YEAR UPDATE*** May 2021I bought myself some sound healing instruments for my birthday, and recorded them on this 3 year old Blue Snowball Mic yesterday using FCPX as the software. This mic is a CHAMP! It picks up the most minute sounds. In the 3 years I've had this mic, I've recorded hundreds of voice overs, meditations, karaoke sessions, yoga classes, and just started recording sound baths. I didn't think this mic would pick up the tuning fork, but HOLY WOW! The tuning fork sounds like a crystal singing bowl when recorded with this mic! It can pick up the imperceptible sound from the fork I cannot hear as the vibration slows. I also just moved and now live near a freeway and this mic even picks up the soft hum of the cars that echoes through my ceiling vent. THAT's how sensitive this mic is. I stand corrected from my initial review, this mic might be great for music recording if you need a budget friendly mic. This mic is so sensitive, I have to be careful not to swallow or breathe too loud, lol, because it picks that up, too. The video I posted is of a tuning fork 432 hz, and a tongue drum tuned to C. (Mind you, this is my first day playing the drum after a couple of hours)",

                "reviewText": "The mic is decent.It's super easy to use. Plug and use without software.Pros: Good quality, Good sound quality, Good voice receptionCons: No volume control on the mic itself, No mute button, Too big, tripod too big, low volume during certain in-game communications (might be just me, but I have seen similar experiences online).The mic for me has been great, but in some cases, with certain video games like CS2, the volume can come as super low according to others. I tried adjusting the input volume but the same outcome. It is fine on communication applications, but for in-game communications, it is a problem.Another problem is that it is super big especially if you are using the tripod which takes up table space. The tripods are long and can extend out which takes up space. This can be avoided by shortening the legs but it results in it being increased in height and the ball can block certain parts of my screen. I don't use the legs and instead just have the snowball under my monitor. It is a ball but even without the legs it is super stable and does not move.These are the only problems I have with the mic. I would give it a 3.5 stars. It is a decent name-brand mic for its price.",

Once it arrived it was a little hard to get set up and I had to order a boom arm for it to make it easier to use. The stand it comes with is not very good at shock absorption I tested it a few times before buying my boom arm and every time I typed on my keyboard or bumped my desk it would make awful static noises. On the other hand with the boom arm that I bought I can bump my desk and slam my keyboard without any annoying noises or problems. The microphone quality is amazing, many of my friends say it\u2019s like we was talking face to face it\u2019s so clear! I highly recommend this microphone, but I recommend buying a boom arm with it as well!",
