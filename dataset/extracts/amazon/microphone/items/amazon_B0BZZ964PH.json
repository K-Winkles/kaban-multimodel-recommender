                "reviewText": "I loved this mic for the few months it worked. The sound WAS great and it WAS easy to use. I bought it in July. This past week (January) I plugged it into my iPhone and noticed after I'd done some recording that it didn't work. I looked for troubleshooting info on the sorry excuse for an instruction book that came with it and for ways to contact the company but of course that doesn't exist these days for cheap junk from overseas. Both of the mics and the part you plug into the phone has been kept in the original box so it's been protected from damage....no reason it shouldn't work. So anyway, I unplugged it from my phone and it turned right on when I plugged it into my iPad, but that's not what I use to record video since it's so much better on my phone. I tried plugging it into my phone again and after some wiggling, I got the little green light to come on on the part you plug into the phone, but it still doesn't record any sound. So since there are no helpful humans to talk to, I guess I'm stuck with a cool microphone shaped paperweight. So so so disappointing.",

I got a great little selfie stick tripod thing and it is like having a video production studio in my bag. I have only had it a few days so I can't speak to longevity, but for this price if I break it (or more likely lose it) I will just get a new one.",
