The mics are surprisingly well constructed, and the cables are long enough to accommodate the room.Audio quality is also good for karaoke and they pick up just your voice well, but don't expect to be using these for podcasting.",

Today one of them randomly stopped working. We verified that it wasn\u2019t an issue with the port on the Xbox as the other mic worked fine plugged into it. We also tried plugging the dead one into other ports but got nothing from it - just completely unresponsive while the other one stiff functions.",

Yes Rockband does work with headsets including wireless ones now, but do you really want a 4 year old controlling the volume going into their ears. I place this on a mic stand and it becomes a stationary device that is adjusted for each kids height.",
