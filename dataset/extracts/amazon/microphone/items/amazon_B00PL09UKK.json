                "reviewText": "Okay...I HAD to try it. I have a thing about finding diamonds in the rough. This little mic qualifies. I have some very well-respected mainstream microphones...and really don't need any more. That said, I had to try the Behringer 8500...yup, it was legit. Now the Behringer \"upgrade\" SM-85a, by contrast, was a disappointment...the 8500 sounded better to my ears and had far less handling noise. CAD mics are also an incredible value in a microphone.That brings me to the Weymic WM58...very, very close to the Behringer 8500...for eleven bucks less! (okay, I did sorta admit that I look for low-hanging fruit) The sound is very well-balanced, with maybe a little hot spot in the midrange, but, despite some comments to the contrary, I did notice a proximity effect, which I appreciate in fattening up a vocal. Construction is solid. I see a lot of situations where an individual probably doesn't need to spend any more money to have a good-sounding working microphone.Well done, Weymic!",

I play guitar and sing, so I also will not be walking around or manhandling the unit...I'm impressed...it was worth the purchase so far...but you always get what you pay for in the end.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The microphone that I got, the wires were \"not\" un-soldered. I was careful check inside and I'm not sure why people would go in there in the first place, but again the wires in mine was OK.I write and record commercially licensed music under performance rights organization BMI, Inc as a songwriter/composer. Listen to my short instrument called \"There is a light\" that I attached to this review. This is from the microphone and there is hardly no other effects that I used except for post reverb. The recording applications that I am using the microphone for is to record direct baritone ukulele and also guitarlele (gutalele/guilele) which is not hooked up to any amplifier. I am using the xlr input jack on my USB audio interface that does have a mic' pre-amp. This microphnoe is so good as an alternative to the SM57, that I'm actually using it for many instrumental tracks like the one that I have in this review... It's that good of a microphone.You'll see a lot of guys stating that this microphone has a bit of a mid scoop in regards to the frequencies which is GOOD because many acoustic stringed instruments you want to have that in regards to pre or post EQ anyways. The other thing to note, is the reason why I use a dynamic microphone like this, is not just the over all cost.. It's because large or small diaphragm condenser microphone can pickup A LOT of outside noise. This microphone does not pick up any outside noise. Also, there is not a lot of noise floor / self-noise if you keep the gain down low, and then use normalization to boot the db's of the track in question. - Tom",

I was looking for a secondary hand held vocal mic as I realized I screwed up some recordings holding a sensitive condenser mic for a vocal. I did get a proper arm and pop screen for the condenser mics and they work great but I thought I should get a handheld XLR mic for certain vocal situations.I say it's a great secondary vocal mic just because most producers use condensers on vocals but you could easily record studio quality vocals with this mic. I don't have a professional studio where may need I to mpress clients with expensive brand name gear - I just care if it works. This mic works as advertised looks and feels like the famous counterpart.",
