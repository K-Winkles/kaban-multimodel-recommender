                "reviewText": "Plug and Play for my iPhone. The device charges up fast, and you plug the mini receiver into your iPhone using the USB C plug or plug it into your wall charger or computer. Once charged, plug the lightning end of the receiver into your phone. The instructions say that you should see an icon on your phone showing it plugged in, but not on an iPhone.Turn on the microphone by pressing the plug on the back of the microphone, and clip it to your shirt. You should see a green light that it is on, and open your recording device on your phone and start recording. The result is a high-quality recording. It is a bit \"boomy\" but adequate for many things, like podcasts or client recordings. The box is a great storage case for all the supplies too. The device works great; a simple, easy, and affordable way to have better recordings. I tried it from 60 feet away, works fantastic. I love this little device and two microphones!!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this microphone set to make recordings on my iPhone.If you need to create a podcast, record sound, or conduct an interview, this microphone set might work for you. You can use a single microphone or use both at the same time. The microphones will clip onto a lapel or collar easily and attach securely. They charge via a USB cable (only one cable is included, so you'll need to provide your own cable if you need to charge both mics at the same time.)The receiver unit plugs into your iPhone or iPad via the lightning port. I have a case on my phone but it did not interfere with the connection. You might have an issue if you have a thick case, though. Once attached and turned on, the microphones connected to the receiver without issues.Placement of the microphones matters a lot. If you have the microphone too close to your mouth, the sound is distorted. If you have it too far away, the volume is insufficient. It took a little experimenting, but I was able to find the sweet spot without much trouble.For professional podcasters/iPhone videographers, this kit probably won't provide the quality needed. For more casual users, though, there is no reason to spend more.",
