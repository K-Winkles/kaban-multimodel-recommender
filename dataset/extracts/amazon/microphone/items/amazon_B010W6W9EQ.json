                "reviewText": "I have had this a few days and putting it through it's paces. This is a wonderful piece of gear for the price. The sound quality is quite excellent. It's a little warmer and fuller than a SnowBall. It's much smaller and easier to position. And, it's got monitoring function for headphones. That's a lot of features. It has three sound signature settings (one is dead flat) and they are very useful. Some have noted disappointment that it's plastic frame rather than metal. I do not get that criticism. I mean, portability is one of it's two claims to great value, so who wants to lug around a heavy ball of metal to have metal? This looks great and is very well made. The plastic is high quality and looks good, and besides, when you drop the mic (and you will eventually drop the mic), this does not have all the added weight of a lot of metal to add to the shock for the internals.The stand is adequate and kind of good looking. It's well made and designed.The other great thing about this mic is it's number one advantage over most other mics for purposes people are likely interested in this: you can plug it right into an IOS device because it works with lightening connection. That's amazing. That means I can take my iPad with an app like TwistedWave (great great app) and get high quality sounds right into my iPad while monitoring with headphones out the back of the mic. That's a whole lot of function for $99.Sounds great. Loads of options. Attractive. Great size for not taking up too much space on desk. If you want to pay a bit more and get better sound, get an AT2020 from Audio Technica. But this delivers excellent sounds with portability, smaller size, and that cool ability to record right to an IOS device (if you like).Ability to have headphone monitoring right off the mic with a volume control at this price point and sound quality is another big plus.Update after using for months. I love this mic. As noted, I have a better quality mic but I don\u2019t use it anymore. This mic from Shure is too perfect a combo of size, features, and performance. I recently recorded a video for YouTube streaming with my iPad Pro using this mic. Flawless performance. Produced great output which was edited then with iMovie for good result. To have the option of recording high quality audio with lightning input is so useful. It has also performed marvelously as a usb mic with both Window 10 machine and MacBook. (Side point. Windows is not way outperforming MAC os for easily producing good results with HD webcam and good mic. Apple needs to step it up.) This mic produces superior, great sound for voice for audio or audio/video recording. Buying a second one to keep at other office.",

                "reviewText": "If I seem over-giddy here, it's because I've been tussling with electronics lately, and not winning. I love technology (maybe as much as Kip), but it doesn't always love me back, like today when Adobe Premiere crashed in the middle of a big project and took much of my day to troubleshoot. But, not my Shure table mic that arrived today. I took it out of the box, glanced at the manual, plugged it into Garageband, opened up a vocal track and BAM! It worked like a charm, easing a day of technofrustration. I like things that work like they are supposed to. It opened several tracks preset to effects; Narration, Bright vocals, telephone, fuzzy, and robot. I found the narration preset to be crystal clear and very suitable for voiceover and podcast recordings. The robot and telephone presets were fun to play around with and tweak. I found myself replicating Adrian Belew's phone speaking parts from his beautifully haunting & melancholy, \"Phone call from the Moon\" with the sung parts through the Bright Vocals preset. I must say, I didn't sound too bad. Now, if only I could play the spacy lead guitar in that song. I have other, more expensive mics for my musical vocal work. But, for the money, this little Shure does some decent heavy lifting and, with the use of my pop filter, will work just fine. Logic Pro will take a little more prep, but should render even better results. Not a big surprise, as Shure has occupied a prominent place in mics since... the invention of mics. So, it is easy for me to recommend this model as a very serviceable mic at a really great value. Honestly, you could spend a lot more and not really notice that much of a difference. Good bang for the buck. And, in these Covid times, couldn't we all use just a little bang for our buck? That, and electronics that work right out of the box. Peace and love to every reader of this review.",

I coupled this with an extendable desk arm (GUITTO Mic Boom Arm) and it soon became part of my everyday Zoom setup as well.Don't forget to enable the special button on the back that makes it perfect for recording vocals! Really great product, and SUPER portable as well.",

                "reviewText": "I spend most of my day on Teams audio calls and I was finding that wearing headphones all day was fatiguing. The mic from my laptop and the mic from my external camera all caused echo issues for others on the calls. This mic solved the echo issues and improved my audio (according to others) As you can see in the image, I have this connected to my computer via USB and audio out connected to an external audio amp and speakers. The speakers are inches behind the microphone and, because of the unidirectional (cardioid) microphone pick-up pattern, the audio that the microphone does pick up is able to be effectively cancelled by the MS Teams and Zoom echo cancellation. I do have the \"Speech\" mode enabled on the mic and that does help the output audio; see Shure documentation for more info pubs.shure.com/guide/MV5C/en-US.",
