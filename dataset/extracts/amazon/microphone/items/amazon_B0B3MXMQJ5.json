The stock microphone broke almost instantly. I had to order another, but being a teacher, I couldn't afford an expensive one. The OneOdio55 microphone works wonderfully. The sound is crisp and clear, and the microphone itself is very sturdy. The microphone clip can be used with a standard microphone stand. Great value for a great price !",

I use them in preference to others that I have that cost many times more. The ON55 did not disappoint. It's a great mic, amazing value and, as l said the price belies the quality you're getting.
