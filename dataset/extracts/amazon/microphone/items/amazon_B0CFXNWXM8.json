The internal microphone often garbled my voice to the point that the Pimslueur app could not understand what I was saying. It also, sometimes would not pick up my initial words. (You can play back your recording for self evaluation). It was so bad that I stopped using the voice coach function because the recordings were so unreliable. With the Ko-Star mic, everything is picked up and is recorded crystal clear. Frustration gone learning continues. \ud83d\ude0e",

                "reviewText": "I bought this mic to use for Twitch streaming, which I'm a total beginner at so I wasn't looking for anything fancy, and I'm impressed! I don't know much about mics anyway, so this was so easy to plug in and start using without issue. It hooked up with OBS no problem. The sound quality is good enough for my needs, and my friends who tuned into my stream said that everything sounded crystal clear. I also recorded a couple clips just to see for myself, and it didn't seem to pick up any background noise or have any static/weird noises or anything.The RGB lighting is cool too, though I cannot for the life of me figure out how to change the settings. I'm not sure if that's located in computer settings or something, but there wasn't any software that popped up when I plugged it in, and there doesn't appear to be a button to change it on the mic itself.I was also very glad to find a mic that came in pink, however I will say that the color isn't quite true to the listing. The pictures made it look like a light baby pink, but the product is more of a peachy pink, almost like a salmon color (see photo). It's not the end of the world, but I know some people are very particular about their setup colors so just be mindful of that. This is why I knocked off a star in my rating.Overall, it's good for the price and definitely good for a beginner at streaming. I'm not sure how well it would do for something like podcasting or music recording or anything though. The only thing is I'm not sure how much I actually like streaming in general lol so there's a chance that I'll end up returning this anyway, but that's not a reflection of the product quality at all! Would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I originally ordered this mic thinking that it is actually bigger than it is. I was thinking that it is more similar to a full size desktop mic; but it is actually kind of a small mic. About half the size of a normal condenser microphone. However it still produces decent well balanced recording of my voice. I only use it for VOIP calls and occasionally as a secondary Mic when I play online games. Although I have a normal Lapel mic for that which doesn't sound as good as this mic.The cable that came with the mic is actually a decent length which let me plug this into my HUB which is a bit far away from where I actually use the mic.Overall I am pretty happy with it, even if it is smaller than I expected.",

The microphone has a USB-C port for power and data, and comes with USB-C to USB-A cable, as well as a USB-A to USB-C adapter, so it\u2019s ready to connect to any common USB port.The sound quality is pretty good. Unsurprisingly, it doesn\u2019t pick up voices as well as more expensive conference microphones, and the resulting audio quality isn\u2019t as good either. Even so, it works for basic voice recording/streaming and is easy to control.Overall, I can recommend this microphone for casual use, but it isn\u2019t a replacement for a professional microphone.",
