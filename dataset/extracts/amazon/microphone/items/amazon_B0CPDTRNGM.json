                "reviewText": "Seamless connection of the headset's Bluetooth with our PC. My daughter has enjoyed playing various video games, reporting to me that she can hear more clearly the details of the game and the directions of the sounds in the game. I appreciate the headphones because I don't have to hear video game sounds in my living room anymore, lol.The light up LED definitely adds a cool factor that my teen loves. Wireless is a must for teens and this fits the bill. She claims to re-charge the battery in the headset about once a week with her playing nearly all day, every day. The battery should last even longer for those gamers who don't play all day everyday. That's a better battery performance than my Bose Bluetooth earbuds.I don't think I would have paid the original $70 that it costed, but the Amazon discount price of $49.99 was completely reasonable, making this a high-quality purchase for a reasonable price. I'm planning on getting a second headset for our family friend's son's upcoming 19th birthday next month. I guess that's my way of saying I'd recommend this headset for anyone needing a happy teenager for a reasonable price.My only CON was the delivery person, which of course doesn't reflect anything about this product. The delivery guy left this box in a bush where we couldn't see it for several days and then it rained and snowed. The packaging was soaking wet, but fortunately for us all the electronics were wrapped in plastic on the inside and nothing got damaged.",

Maybe I got a faulty unit, I don't know. I bought this for my daughter to use with her new Xbox. Connecting is touchy at best, the headset really struggled, and it took us about 15 minutes to get it to pair without disconnecting right away. Once it was connected, you can't hear anything. Turn the volume up in every way (headset, application, you get it) and you get a whisper of sound. And by whisper, I mean you can hear something there, but the sound of pressing buttons on the controller is louder, and drowns it out. If you stop pushing buttons to listen you can enjoy blissful quiet audio until a fly next door starts buZing around. And that will drown out your headset as well. Very disappointing, especially since the kid already chucked the box, so I guess this is a $60 bundle of maybe salvageable parts. There are probably great, low cost wireless headsets out there, somewhere...this is not one of them. Buyer beware, you will be remorseful of this purchase.",
