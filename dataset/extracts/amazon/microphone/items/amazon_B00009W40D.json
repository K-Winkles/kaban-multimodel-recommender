                "reviewText": "I received the product from Audiosavings promptly and before the date promised. I'm not very experienced with sound recording, but this Nady mic performs very well (and as good as I'd hoped); and the price is excellent. It is soundly constructed with a quality cable. Acoustics seem very good. The on/off switch is very useful (I'd hate to have to do without it).The mic arrived with a 15 foot cable instead of the 20 foot cable advertised. I needed the longer cable for my setup. I contacted Audiosavings right away, and they responded immediately, offering to work with me to supply the advertised 20 foot cable with my returning the 15 foot cable. I then proposed an alternative to make the mic/cable work for me via my mixer--a male XLR to male 1/4-inch adapter. It would give me more flexibility than the original order. They agreed and sent me not only an adapter but a 10 foot adapter cable ($19.95 value at their web site),and they footed the expense for both the adapter cable and shipping. All with prompt service and without argument. So I'm singing their praises.The combination of a really good mic and excellent customer service warrants the five-stars. I'll deal with these guys any time.",

                "reviewText": "I originally purchased this for my daughter for use as a second mic for her Karaoke machine. Since then I have borrowed it for a back up vocalist in a band I have recently joined. Today I am online to purchase two more to replace the \"professional\" mic's supplied by another band member for the rest of the vocalists. The other mics are nothing but feedback generators, and sound far too thin compared to this Nady. This mic is not quite as responsive as my Shure SM58, but it's close enough for live music, and the price just can't be beat. This mic is nice and hefty, and the quality of materials used in construction is very apparent. Frankly, I don't understand how anybody can really be profiting from building and shipping them for this price. So far I haven't had any issues with the supplied cable, but if the professional in you can't tolerate the thought of singing through a 1/4\" jack, you can use it with an XLR cable purchased separately. My only complaint is that it has a cheesy label wrapped around it just beneath the screen that absolutely screams \"karaoke mic\". To summarize: If you can't afford a $100 mic, skip everything between, and go straight for this one at ten bucks.",

                "reviewText": "I just received the package today which was very well packaged. but the reason why I gave only four star is because I can tell this was a return item. The box is ripped partially open the microphone wasn't even placed correctly in the plastic molding that would comfortably support the microphone for shipping. The twist tie that was holding the bundle of excessive wire wasn't professionally wrapped from Factory correctly. All indications showing that this was a return product so it was not brand new out of the box. I asked you pay for something that's brand new. So I was a little nervous at first because my thoughts were why was his return this must be defective broken until I plugged it into my amplifier to test it out. And it must have been my lucky day because the microphone and it up working perfect. The on and off switch works the cable disconnect from the mic ok and I unscrewed the top of the microphone to make sure the condenser mic was not damaged by the previous people that returned it and that seems to be intact and was not damaged. So I couldn't find anything wrong with this microphone so I'm deciding to keep it but unfortunately I'm leaving the four star because I did pay for a brand new out of the box microphone and I did not receive that. Shame on the vendor for releasing such merchandise to a consumer that is paying for something that is brand new. There should have been a small discount off on something that was actually return. But I am willing to let this go for now but I would like to make it known here to Amazon and to the public. As far as the microphone it feels like a very nice quality microphone it has good weight the frequency response according to the manual is not bad and it works very well with my amplifier. Very quiet stable microphone and seems to be a good manufactured product since I've never purchase from this vendor before. I would like to say I would recommend this vendor but like I said above I did receive a used product but I do recommend the microphone",

                "reviewText": "I run a Karaoke DJ service and my Mic's are constantly being abused by patrons who have had a little to much liquid encouragement. The included Mic cable is decent but not what I use. The Mic it's self has clean crisp sound and it has been dropped numerous times and still sounds clear and works well. I would not recommend this for actual live band use except for instrument pick ups would be fine. With that being said it does work great and is very sturdy for the Karaoke abuse.",

Not sure what exactly happened, but come 4th of July, I have a karaoke party, and 1 of the mics just doesn't work anymore. I pulled it apart, put it back together - no go. Kind of a bummer when you've got 20 people in your house ready to karaoke.",

                "reviewText": "A little over half a year ago I decided I wanted to start a podcast. Looking into equipment I grabbed a decent $40 mixer, some 1/4 mono to 1/8 stero converter cables, an MXL 990 with shock mount, two XLR cables, and this NADY mic as a guest mic. I tried over and over to tune the MXL in correctly and could never get it to sound right. I noticed, however, that my guests sounded awesome on the cheaper NADY SP-4C. After I went to having guests dial in through Skype I started using the NADY SP-4C as my main mic and its astounding the quality you get out of it. Remember DO NOT use the included XLR to 1/4 cable, it sounds horrible with that. Instead lay down the $6 or so bucks on the XLR cable you can easily get through Amazon and you'll have an excellent mic.If you want to listen to the quality yourself check out my podcast. Just search for Holy Shatt on iTunes or go to Raleighite.com",

                "reviewText": "Bought it, and overall it sounds pretty good for the price. There are lots of cheap microphones out there today, and a good dynamic normally costs about $100, so going this low in price isn't really suggested. That said, it still holds up pretty well comparatively.The non-balanced cable it came with was prone to a lot of noise. I replaced it with quality balanced cable that cost as much as the microphone itself, but it got the noise level down.It is prone to handling noise, but I get the same level of noise when handling my SM57. It also isn't able to handle plosives (pops) all that well, but this isn't an issue if using proper microphone technique.Like most dynamic mics, this requires a lot of gain to use, so if you don't have a decent mic preamp, you're either going to have low volume or lots of noise. Just something to be aware of.The tone of the microphone isn't really appealing to me, but I'm use to using $400 dynamic microphones. It will pass the grade for most people easily.Overall, I bought this for someone starting out with recording live interviews in public spaces. It's a good price, but I tend to think if you're going to do something, it's better to spend a bit more money and do it right. Still, a solid buy for most people, and it definitely offers good value for something like karaoke.",
