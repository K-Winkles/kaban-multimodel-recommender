                "reviewText": "I did not want to buy this but it was needed for a project. I'm an old audio engineer from 1980s and I was a real snob when he came to sub-par audio gear. It wasn't Shure, Yamaha , Altec or Crown it was crap. I had zero expectations!First off: the mic stand is decent, looks good, and functions; I wish it had a standard threading.The Mic: For a condenser mic, it works really well; it has a nice warm tone. Like all condenser microphones, it has horrible background noise pick up, unless of course you like that kind of stuff.Now the mixer board: I like it! It works with two cell phones (one iphone, other android) and my Mac Mini with background from a iPad. The cables are crap but work. It is nowhere near a professional piece of equipment but it works well; there's some buzzes but it seems to hold on and not drop out. The effects and voice changer are cool too. If you are thinking about starting a podcast this would be a good 1st date.",

When it was addressed they quickly sent me a new item. It came very quick and I was still able to do my upcoming interview on time. I have not had a problem with the new one. I ;love the quality. My podcast comes out clear, no breaking up. Great product for the price. It does not break your pocket and you can easily learn how to work it. I would purchase again if I needed to. I have not had experience with gaming so I did not put a rating there.",

                "reviewText": "The microphone and arm set up is quite great all on its own and works with your typical mic jack slot. The only downside to this purchase is the soundboard that they throw in with this mic. It's a cheap board that you can find online elsewhere on its own. There is a good amount of static that comes through both your mic and headset when using its ports and the wires included seem to break easy internally. Overall would be mediocre if not good if not for its connectivity issues. But if you're just looking for a mic and this product is on sale, then by all means, get it for the mic.",

Download and use 3rd party software to boost the volume during the recording process? No effect, volume still too low. Bypass the useless v8 soundcard and connect directly to PC? No effect, volume still too low.This has been a frustrating experience trying to get this thing to be usable and it just isn't. Absolute trash. Much regret.",

                "reviewText": "So far so good works as described functions as described. I guess it's kind of luck of the draw. I did not have any of the mentioned background noise or static or anything like that. I also didn't have any problems with the mic not being loud enough. It comes through nice crisp and clear so it's replacing my 8-year-old bm800 that I got forever ago and was running without an amp and this sounds significantly better than that and that Mic sounded good according to everybody. So I say give it a shot with Amazon's return policy and how good of a deal this is I think it's worth it if you get a bad one either refund your money or try switching it out for another one cuz I believe if you get a working one you'll be happy.Qualities decent the materials are decent I mean it's obviously cheap but the arm is amount could be better it just is a c-clamp with like a pivoting dish on top of it so I had to use a piece of 1x1 to to be able to mount it to my desk which is fine. Literally the only thing that I was sad to see was how short the microphone cable was which isn't an issue I've got a 6 ft cord from my old mic but for people that don't have one laying around could cause some sort of limitations.",
