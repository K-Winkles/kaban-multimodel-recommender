                "reviewText": "Edit #2: After much troubleshooting, I\u2019ve finally determined that the problem I am having is with the APP I have been using, and not with this product. In fact, once I resolved the problem with my app, I am impressed with the audio I am getting from this microphone. Changing my rating, and my apologies to the seller for my mistake. +1 for your customer service in reaching out to me to rectify the issue. Raising my rating to 5 stars based on a good product and excellent customer service.Edit: I want to be fair to the company that produces / sells this microphone. After I posted the below review, they reached out to me and sent me a free replacement. So kudos for customer service. I really wanted this one to work so I could write my prior bad experience down to it just being a lemon, and give them 5 starts for resolving the issue, but that\u2019s not the case. This new one has the same high-pitched scratching sound as the first one, and is completely unusable. Maybe this mic will work well in a static indoor situation, but for filming outdoor sports where I am moving around the camera to follow the play, it just doesn\u2019t work.Kudos to your customer service, but unfortunately this product just doesn\u2019t work well at all.\u2014 Original Review \u2014I bought this for live-streaming youth sports, hoping that using an actual microphone would eliminate wind noise. Every time I speak or the crowd cheers, this microphone turns it into an ear-piercing high-pitched scratching sound. This thing is absolutely worthless. Don\u2019t buy.",
