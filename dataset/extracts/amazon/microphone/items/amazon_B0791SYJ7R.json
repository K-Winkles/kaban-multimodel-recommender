Offering the same stunning sound quality as sE\u2019s highly-regarded V7, the V7 BFG is a dynamic vocal hand-held microphone with a supercardioid polar pattern, delivering a crisp, open sound that perfectly captures your voice in the most natural way you've ever heard on stage. The sophisticated capsule design helps isolate your voice from other instruments, ensuring vast amounts of gain before feedback, and its brand new, patented shockmount efficiently decouples the capsule from mechanical vibration, providing the lowest handling noise in its class.",

The special chromatized all-metal chassis is designed to hold up under on-stage stress for years, and the spring steel mesh grille is dent-proof and corrosion-free for perfect reliability. Also, see that beveled edge around the grille? That prevents your mic from rolling around when you put it down on top of your amp or the stage floor. (It's the little things that count.) The V7 BFG's gold-plated XLR connector also ensures a loss-free and reliable signal connection for years to come. INNOVATIVE, SPECIALIZED ALUMINUM VOICE COIL The DMC7 dynamic element in the V7 BFG has been custom-developed for a crisp, open sound that perfectly captures your voice in the most natural way you've ever heard on stage - and its sophisticated supercardioid capsule design helps isolate your voice from other instruments, ensuring vast amounts of gain before feedback. Proven Neodymium magnets, tight production tolerances & high-end workmanship ensure excellent sensitivity, superior sound quality and superb consistency. PATENTED INTEGRATED SHOCK MOUNT AND INTERNAL WINDSCREEN The V7 BFG's brand new, patented shockmount efficiently decouples the capsule from mechanical vibration, providing exceptionally low handling noise as compared to other mics in its class. This means you can feel free to move around on stage without fear of rumbles, pops, or anything other than your voice coming through. And the internal windscreen efficiently reduces unwanted wind noise and plosive pops.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to fill out a space in my mic locker. I have SM58s and a Beta 58 but needed one more vocal mic so I thought I'd give this a try. To my ears (and those of my bandmates) it falls somewhere in the middle of the 58s - it's clearer and has more gain than an SM58, but not as good overall as a Beta 58. In my situation the backup singer adopted the V7, lead singer kept the Beta and the SMs are now for guests / spares. It appears to be as well constructed as the Shures, although I guess time will ultimately tell that story, and it looks cool also. For the price you really can't beat it.",

                "reviewText": "Every SE mic I\u2019ve tried has been, at the very least, solid if not darn impressive. The V7 MK is no different. The tighter pattern really keeps background noise manageable, but the MK in particular feels like a hidden gem. This one has the capsule of the V7X, an instrument mic with an extended bass response, but the grille is that of the regular V7, which means it handles plosives a little better than the regular V7X. I would describe the mids as punchy and somehow this doesn\u2019t have that typical dynamic grainy sound that others possess. It\u2019s smooth and despite the increased bass, it still has extension in the top end, maintaining clarity. It reminds me a lot of a condenser sound, and yea, if you put them side by side with an actual LDC, you\u2019d know, but only if you were attempting to notice. Otherwise, this is a fantastic offering and I will sing its praises to anything who will listen.",

These are some of the best and strudiest vocal mics going, and they look great mic'ing a guitar cabinet or drum kit. Other mics in the line, like the paired condensers, and the phantom powered ribbon mics are incredible in their own right. We really like S.E. mics. Both in the studio booth, and onstage, they are great.",

                "reviewText": "Using this currently as a mic for gaming, sounds like a condenser and I have yet to use it around in my studio, I did swivel the boom clamp around towards my drumset and the cymbals sounded incredibly detailed and realistic. It doesn't sound harsh, you can clearly hear the details and I spent a half hour just talking into it and loving the sound. Not a fan of my voice but I was having fun talking and singing into it. Nice bass response when you utilize it's proximity effect, and I consider getting another vintage colored one, and might buy a few of the V7x. Also I'm using a shockmount for a 57, and a deadcat for a AT-2035, and it helps with isolation and plosives.",
