Sounds even better if you try to do a asmr. I also liked how there are 2 microphones, you can use em both at the same time and it pick up the sounds no problem. The different adapters are pretty good too, you can use it on old or new phone with no problem.",

The instructions were super clear and the sound was incredible. I propped my phone up next to the TV with a show playing and I could hear myself clearly across the room and not the show! I love that there's two mics included and replacement parts just in case. Definitely recommend this!",
