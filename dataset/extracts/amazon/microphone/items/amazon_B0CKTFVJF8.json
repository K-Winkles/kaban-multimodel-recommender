I think I found the answer with the Wireless Lavalier Microphone.It arrived so tidily packed which I loved! I got it super quickly after ordering it.The setup process was simple and the microphone was easy to use. I think for me, it is a matter of how to have the little receiver part that hangs off the phone not cumbersome when I am walking at the park with my dog recording video. I have to work on that but that is my problem, not the mikes. I do wish the receivers could be smaller or magnetically attach to the phone in some way. I have an iPhone 15 Pro.The microphone really met my expectations at a good price. I highly recommend it!",
