Note: If you experience these situations: Microphone cut in & outMicrophone working range very shortMicrophone sound lot of noise, too much feedback, weak sound, etc. Receiver RF Signal Indicator flashesReceiver volume control can't adjust microphone volume First Check the normal working status of microphone and receiver: 1. Receiver power Indicator is on and the antennas are correctly installed; 2. microphone power Indicator is on; 3. Receiver RF Signal Indicator A, B, C, D is on(Means microphone A, B, C, D have connect with receiver rightly. NOTE: The Microphone Volume Control of Receiver is also Microphone RF Signal Indicator). If all yes, it means microphone and receiver device have no quality problem. SOLUTIONS: Most of the time, the microphone and receiver have no quality problem, very likely that the current microphone frequency is being disturbed, so we need to switch microphone frequency to avoid interference(How to change microphone frequency, refer to User Manual -> OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS -> POINT 3). See whether this can solve the problem. If not, try to reset current microphone connection with receiver(How to reset, refer to User Manual -> OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS -> POINT 5), then change microphone frequency again. The above operations can basically solve most product problems. Besides, you also need to notice potential nearby sources of RF interference, such as CD players, computers, digital devices, earphone monitoring systems, etc. Multiple Sets Using: When work with 2 sets or more simultaneously, please make sure mics are set with different channels. If multiple systems are being used, increase the frequency separation between systems.",

                "reviewText": "Wireless microphone systems extend the flexibility of sound systems. They offer the ability to move microphone sources more easily to extended geographic areas.This system does even more. The unit includes 4 wireless unidirectional microphones, which simultaneously mix into the system. Each has its own volume control on the front of the unit and there is an input for a fifth wired microphone.Microphones are letter- and color-coded to make it easier to match to the unit. It has a mixed 1/4\" and 1/8\" output jacks. The broadcast frequency is displayed on the microphones themslves, which run on two AA batteries. You can easily expect several hours of use from the batteries.The unit itself is wired into the speaker system, offering approximately 200 ft microphone distance from the unit.Antiskid rings and foam shields are included, which help tremendously in use and when you want to set them down.The sound is good and reasonably clear. They work as they should. These are a good asset and offer more flexibility than a single microphone unit, at a much more impressive price.",
