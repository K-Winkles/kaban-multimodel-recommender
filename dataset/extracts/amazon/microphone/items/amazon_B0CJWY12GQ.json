                "reviewText": "I was super impressed by this DUAL wireless mic. It has both a mixed 1/4 inch output or you can use separate XLR outputs for each channel. It auto syncs the handheld to the receiver unit. I just put in 2 aa batteries and it was ready to go. My first mic goes from from 635.1 to 658.6 mHz in .5 mHz steps. The second mic goes from 659.1 to 682.6. So there is no way that you will overlap channels with this system. Very nice feature. The power / mute button is near the bottom of the handheld mic so users won't accidentally hit it while picking up the mic or while using it. A push of the channel button inside the battery cover of the mic lets you jump to other channels and it auto syncs with the base unit. I went over 80 ft away and it sounded great. The box mentions 520 - 980 mHz range, so your setup may be in different range. This is a GREAT wireless microphone setup for this price. Great for a mobile Karaoke setup or presentation where you need 2 microphones. Highly recommended !",

                "reviewText": "This wireless system operates within the 659.1 - 682.6MHz frequency range, which is restricted by the FCC for civilian use in the United States. Second, the receiver is extremely light weight and overall, just feels very cheap. The weight and feel of the microphones actually seem okay, but the receiver almost feels hallow. Third, the unit is extremely quiet. To have decent volume levels, you have almost yell into the microphone with the volume on the receiver maxed out. Even with a high quality speaker/pre-amp, you will struggle to get decent levels out of this system. Because of these issues, I didn\u2019t even bother with a detailed audio quality test because it wouldn\u2019t matter \u2013 the product can\u2019t practically be used, nor should it be used due to the frequency range it operates in.",
