                "reviewText": "What's awesome is that this microphone is specifically designed for folks who film with their smartphones, like me. The mic comes with a cool carrying pouch in order to easily carry this around. The microphone feels solid and the cord is a nice length so you're not stuck having to position your phone super close to it. I love the fact it comes with a logo. You can print out your logo and stick right on there giving it a really professional look. All that is nice but where this microphone really shines is the quality of audio. I must admit that I was totally surprised that the quality of this microphone was this good. Sometimes a little too good. It would have been nice if they would have included a dead cat for recording outside on windy days. I'm also going to use this microphone on my make shit boom pole when I shoot my next short film. That's how good the audio quality is. At this price point, I don't think you can go wrong by picking this up.",

I used this in a facebook live video, and attached a clip to hear the audio quality. It works great right out of the box, just plug it in. (Though you might need an adapter like I did to go from a USB-C port to audio. NOTE: Use the Apple brand one and not a 3rd party one)I like that it also includes a carrying case as well and plenty of cord.",

The sound quality is phenomenal cause you can\u2019t really hear background noises, and it makes your voice pop do whoever is watching your video will hear you loud and clear. The value for money is reasonable cause if you look for a microphone like this from other companies is in the $100 and up range, so buying thing for close to $70 is not bad. The quality of the material is great and I have no complaints over it. Matter of fact I\u2019m planning on buying a couple more as time goes on.",
