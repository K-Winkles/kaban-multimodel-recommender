Press the power switch of the microphone for about 1 second to turn it on. If the green light for both of receiver and transmitter always keeps on, it means they paired successfully. 3. Press the power switch of the microphone very softly, the green light will keep flashing, which means the recording was paused. By pressing the button again, it will stop flashing and the recording will continue. 4. Any time when you see the red light & green light flashes alternately, it means the connection is failed and you need to restart. 5. Press and hold the power switch for about 3 seconds to power off the microphone. 6. Special note: The receiver does not have a battery inside, and does not need to be charged during live broadcast. If the power of the mobile phone is insufficient during the live broadcast, the mobile phone can be charged directly through the interface of the receiving end.",

All you do is plug in the receiver to your phone turn on the microphone and go about your business! Super easy to charge two with the USB. This is well worth the $10!!",

It did not pick up the noise while I talked with mic attacked. Did testing near mouth and attached to clothing. Slowly pulled the mic away from myself until arms length away is when I notice you could barely hear me and I have always been told that I speak soft naturally.",
