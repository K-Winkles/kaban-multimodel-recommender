                "reviewText": "For most standard applications, this is will be a decent wireless mic set-up. Karaoke, speeches, meetings, PA systems, etc. It should perform well in most of those tasks.For me, my plan was to use it with props as part of my Halloween display - which I have tested and it does do - but I've had to introduce additional equipment like a small mixer and blue tooth transmitters to get it to do exactly what I want.Pros:- Easy to set up- Compact- Good sound and range- Low interference on USF signal- Mics pair automatically- Budget friendlyCons:- Limited audio out options (6mm or 3-pin XLR only)- Must daisy chain a mixer, amp, or receiver ahead of your speakers- No XLR cables included- Battery-operated Mics are not rechargeableSince my use requires concealing electronics and cables as much as possible, the flexibility to aid in doing so becomes all the more important with components like this. It can be done with this system, but I tend to prefer more all-in-one options. For most applications, this kit will be perfectly suitable and will work well.",
