This USB computer microphone can work with Macbook, you can plug the mic in Macbook and go to \"system preference\"-\"Sound\"-click \"Input\" and set \"USB PnP Audio Device\" as default input device. How can I pick up the sound loudly and clearly? Adjust the gain to a proper level as you need by the gain knob and sound settings, and you'd better speak to the front of the USB computer microphone within 4-6 inches. If possible, please use the mic in a quiet room or space. What is the maximum thickness that the clamp can handle? The computer microphone can mount to the thickness of the desk up to 2.1\u201d, but overly rounded or overhanging desktop edges do not make good mounting surfaces.Make sure both the top and the underside of the C-clamp are resting on the flat surfaces. Is T669 mic compatible with Xbox? This USB computer microphone is NOT compatible with Xbox, but it works well with PS4/PS5. Can I use T669 mic with smartphones or audio mixer? It's NOT compatible with mixer or audio interface. We don't recommend using with smartphones because it may not supply sufficient power to the mic but affect sound quality. If you have to try, please use a genuine USB cable or adapter for connection.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I have several microphones at home and am just getting started making tutorial videos. In my first video, the sound quality wasn't great, where I was using a cheap headset to record the sound. I have lapel mics but haven't tried them out yet and also have DJI wireless mic, but that seems more suited to being mobile. So, I thought I'd give this a shot for when I make Photoshop tutorials.So far I'm glad I did. I tested it out tonight and compared it to the MacBook Pro built-in microphone as well as the Mac Studio Display Microphone. This mic beat both of them hands down.What's in the box: Microphone, Shock Mount, Boom Arm and Desk Clamp, Pop Filter, Accessory Bag with extra parts, Foam Microphone Cover, USB cable (6 foot), User Manual.First impressions: Taking it out of the box it seemed like it was built OK, if you judge build based on weight. I don't expect it will see a lot of moving around, it'll just sit mostly in it's spot on my desk, so it should hold up fairly well. The microphone itself was pretty lightweight, not like other studio mics I've used in the past for music recording. The parts are light aluminum and have the feel of a desk lamp of similar style. The accessory bag has the ring you clamp the microphone on to the shock mount with, some extra shock bands, and an extra pad for the pop filter where it connects to the boom arm.Sound Quality: Very nice!!! I compared it to both the MacBook Pro Built-in microphone and the Mac Studio Display Microphone and it crushes both of them. Granted, the FiFine Mic is close to my mouth when I'm speaking, but you don't hear the fan noise from my MacBook and it's positioned right over the keyboard. If you watch the video, you'll hear the difference of the three.Obviously, I'm not comparing this microphone to another studio condenser microphone at this point because this is the first studio microphone I have purchased for the intended use of making videos. But I think that it has an overall warm sound, it's clear, and best of all, it is priced right.I've only used it for about 10 minutes at this point, but the difference is already worth the small investment. I'll update with additional information as I use it more.UPDATE: November 29, 2023 - I've been using it quite a lot and it's just super for the price point. I hear a huge difference in voice clarity compared to the previous mic I used. It does pick up background noise I noted (a truck drove past my house during a recording), but that's not the mic's fault. I wish the arm was a little more adjustable because I have it off to the side when I record and it almost doesn't reach where I want it. I'm sure I'll figure something out in regards to that after a while. Still love it.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars A Much More Wallet Friendly Alternative To The Unwarranted Hype Of Blue Mics",
                "reviewText": "I make YouTube videos and podcasts several times a week. I have a plethora of renowned microphones--Rode, Neumann, AKG, Oktava, Warm Audio, etc. Let's be honest--the Fifine mic does not challenge any of those.And it's not meant to.Indeed, anyone who is considering buying any of the sub-$200 Blue microphones should seriously consider Fifine first. In my opinion, Blue microphones are terribly harsh and tinny sounding. They have an unusual timbre to the recording--almost a metallic sound, as if someone is processing the voice in a steel container. All the YouTube sensations use Blue--and I wonder how many of them are sponsored.Regardless, the hype behind Blue microphones is undeserved.Fifine's microphone is, on the other hand, appropriately priced. It provides better sound quality than any sub-$200 Blue mic, including the Yeti (the one Blue mic that everyone seems to weep over). Whereas the Yeti sounds brittle and harsh on many voices, the Fifine mic sound a little warmer and certainly does not have the upper-frequency boost of the Yeti.The Fifine mic's build quality is surprisingly good. The housing and basket are all metal; the suspension arm is metal; the cable is wonderfully long to reach any computer near or around your desk; the pop filter does help reduce plosives; and the overall size of everything is diminutive.SOUNDThe Fifine mic's sound is warmer than Blue microphones. This means that the Fifine mic is more flattering to voices. We generally dislike treble frequency resonances and spikes (imagine scratching your nails on a chalkboard), and a lot of cheaper mics (and some expensive ones, too) can't control that treble energy. The Fifine mic for the most part does.The sound is not brittle or harsh or fatiguing. It does not sound hollow or distant. Indeed, the mic has a fairly accurate reproduction of my voice.I always add compression and normalize recordings when using any of my professional mics. But the Fifine needs only a slight db boost or decrease, depending on your recording. Indeed, there is very little I have to do in order to record and then add the recording to my videos or podcasts. Plug and play, indeed.On the other hand, those who want to mess around in Audacity or Audition, add compression and other filters to the recording, will likely be disappointed. I have tried filters and compression on the Fifine mic, and was irritated to find that the recording was immediately distorted. Even minimal filtering will cause the recording to fall apart. If you are recording in a noisy environment, and try to use hiss or click reduction, the recording will likely lose detail and fall apart. Consequently, be wary if your particular use-scenario falls into these parameters.The mic is very sensitive. I keep it at 8 inches from me, and it clearly picks up my voice without any issues. I have a large desktop PC behind the mic, about 2 feet away, and the mic will just barely pick up the fan noise in the background. My setup, I must admit, is not ideal for this. Whereas with XLR condenser or dynamic mics with significantly better components I can reduce or excise that noise in post, it is not really an option on the Fifine for the reasons I mentioned above.BUILDAs I said, the build is surprisingly good. I expect this mic, if used with some care, will last for years.The only real gripe I have about the microphone is the \"volume\" knob on the front. This is basically the gain knob. And it does nothing. There may be slight (VERY slight) gain changes, but I cannot hear them or see them in Audition. It is possible my microphone simply is faulty in this regard, but you may want to check other reviews here to see if this is a trend.Regardless, the mic does pick up my voice without any issues.I was also a little surprised by the quality of the suspension arm. It is, frankly, sturdy. It's the perfect size for the small Fifine mic, clamps on to my desk securely, and has full movement 360-degrees, along with limited vertical adjustment. For desk use, it is everything a budding podcaster or YouTuber will need. In fact, I use the suspension arm for overhead shots with my action camera, too. If not needed, I just unclamp it from my desk and it folds into a small size to stow away.The pop filter is nothing special. It is not specifically made for the Fifine mic--it is comically larger than the mic. But, it does help reduce plosives. Your speech technique is more important than a pop filter--so if you learn how to control plosives and sibilance, any pop filter will be sufficient. What I was relieved to see, however, is that the goose neck on this pop filter is easily adjusted. I have other filters from Aston and Blue that require a ridiculous amount of force to alter the goose neck. Those filters are heavy and unnecessarily and stupidly bulky. They add weight to the suspension arm for no other reason than because the companies wanted their filters to look cool--heavy metal and pointless logos everywhere. However, the filter Fifine provides is big enough to cover any mic basket, light enough to not weigh down a typical suspension arm, and easily clamps and moves when you need it to.OVERALLFor $55, I can't think of a better deal to get your creative studio started. No, the mic does not give you amazing sound quality. And if you upgrade from the Fifine to the Rode NT1 or some other XLR condenser mic, you'll immediately hear the sound difference. But for a USB no-hassle mic--the Fifine does an excellent job.Value for performance? You get everything you need to start your video or podcast studio. And if you're not sure if you are going do the whole creative thing very long, or just want to test out your creative abilities, then I think this mic set is a reasonable and appropriate purchase.Don't fall for the hype that Blue shoves. Consider this mic first.",

                "reviewText": "Un micr\u00f3fono espectacular por la calidad del sonido que ofrece por un precio modesto. Permite trabajar con frecuencias altas y bajas, captando la voz de una manera n\u00edtida y \u00f3ptima.El soporte que viene incluido funciona perfectamente aunque cabe destacar que a veces se siente algo debil, a\u00fan asi no he tenido ningun problema en los dos meses de uso.El kit completo que se ofrece es perfecto para iniciarse en el mundo del podcast o cualquier otro contenido que requiera de largos periodos hablando. Gracias al brazo operable se puede ajustar la distancia y altura del micr\u00f3fono a voluntad lo que lo hace un compa\u00f1ero ideal para una videoconferencia, llamadas en discord o grabaciones semi-profesionales.Si junto a este micr\u00f3fono trabajas con un equalizador digital puedes lograr resultados dignos de micr\u00f3fonos profesionales, que tengan un coste muchisimo mas elevado, 3 o 4 veces m\u00e1s caro.En general es una compra muy recomendada y versatil. Si estas pensando en comprarte un micr\u00f3fono para cualquier actividad, esta es la mejor opci\u00f3n.",
