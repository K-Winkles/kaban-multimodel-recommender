I was about to replace it with another $100 mic stand but decided to take a look on Amazon before I made that purchase. I saw this item and I googled it I saw that it had good reviews and the price was significantly lower. So I purchased it. I ordered it that night and it came the next morning. It comes in a nice case with a handle and is very easy to assemble and disassemble. So it works perfectly in that way for gigs. Also, it is just as sturdy as my old more expensive stand and has all of the same features, It is very adjustable and can suit all height and distance needs. I would highly recommend this stand. It is great quality and the value is awesome.",

More importantly, Cahaya gave great customer service. When my initial tripod arrived without the boom, I contacted them through Amazon. They replied immediately, asking for a photo of what was in the box. Once I did that they came right back and said they were shipping me a totally new tripod, which arrived in a few days. It's likely that Amazon had sent me a returned tripod (and not an error by the company). Terrific customer service and I'll definitely buy another tripod from them down the road.",

I will say the clamp doesn't hold as firmly as I'd like it to, but I don't think it'll be a problem. It does the trick. I'm 5'8 and assembled at max height, this microphone stand is perfect. Probably wouldn't be ideal for anyone over 6', but perfect for me. Definitely a good choice for karaoke night with the fam",
