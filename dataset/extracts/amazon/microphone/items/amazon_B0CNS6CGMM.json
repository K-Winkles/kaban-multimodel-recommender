                "reviewText": "Tested on Acer Predator gaming laptop and custom PC using AE-7 Sound Blaster sound card & software. Tested with PC games, Twitch streams, and streamed music.First, comfort: Ear cups are soft but warm (due to that pleather material). Headband takes some getting used to and adjustments. At first, I did not like the headband but after loosening it up a bit, I was able to tolerate it for hours at a time. The headphones are light and do not apply a lot of pressure to the ears.Sound Quality: Exceptional for the price (about $40 at time of review). For reference, I normally use Sennheiser HD 650s and have a slew of other headphones like Bose, Sony, AKG etc. Well balanced sound, slightly on the bassier side, but still with clarity. I had no difficulty picking up on all sorts of sounds while playing video games and watching Twitch (tested with the gaming laptop without an amp).When paired with the AE-7 Sound Blaster while listening to music, these cans pack a punch. Any 50mm headphones should be paired with some sort of amplifier to get the max benefits out of it. But, I get it, not all devices are going to support that. Slight distortion a full volume, however, at those levels you\u2019ll be damaging your ears.Unfortunately, I was not able to test the microphone, but I have always been of the opinion a dedicated mic is best but not always possible.Overall, I have not tested a better set of headphones at $40. Absolutely recommend these. Four out of Five stars only due to the fact the head strap is a bit odd.",

                "reviewText": "Very nice aesthetic, and the headband delivers on its promised comfort. Sound quality is very clear and nice for this price point, and the microphone folds out of the way when not in use, which is always a huge plus. The ear cups are SOFT and nice and deep. My only complaint is that it would be nice if the headset used a replaceable cord, as I like being able to use cords of different lengths at different settings or be able to replace it if the cord ever becomes damaged, but that's a matter of personal preference. Very impressed with these for their ~$40 asking price at time of review.",

The headset feels very light and hollow, which I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing.The comfort is the best part of the headset for me. The padding is very soft and thick, the headband also makes sure it will fit your head. I also really like the clean aesthetic look of the headset.As for the microphone, it's average. It's the same as any other gaming headset, which is not a bad thing.Overall, even though I don't think this headset is bad, I would always recommend going for headphones designed for music, (unless you really need the microphone) as you always get better sound quality and you get more features for the same price.",

                "reviewText": "Things I like:The audio quality is decent, and it's not lacking in the mid or treble like a lot of budget sets. It's definitely comfy, the headband is a nice touch. The microphone swings up and down instead of retracting into the headset and it picks up audio well.Things I don't like:I have a large, but not huge, head and they barely fit at the widest setting. If I had a lot of curly hair that would be a problem. I could have done without the headband having a colored side, which you can still see when the black side is facing outward. Kinda defeats the purpose so I plan on getting a replacement. So an all black option would be nice as I wouldn't have wanted to spend the extra money upgrading had I not received this for review.All in all, I would recommend and my only criticisms are nitpicks.",

                "reviewText": "This is a really nice gaming headset. I have had other products I've bought from JLabs in the past and never been disappointed. This is no exception. The sound is clear with a good balance of bass and the mic is clear and good pickup for your in-game sessions. It has a cool feature that mutes the mic when you rotate it away from your mouth which is really nice. The ear cushions are super soft and flexible and provide a very good seal that is also very comfortable. Overall a great headset that will provide many hours of enjoyable gaming with friends.",
