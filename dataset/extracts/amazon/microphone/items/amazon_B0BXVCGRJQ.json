                "reviewText": "This was the 3rd mic I tried. None has worked only because (I found out later) the built-in video/camera app on my phone is incompatible with external audio sources. My phone is OTG compatible, but there's nowhere on my phone that takes me to an OTG set up to get this thing to work. So I reached out to BearVlog.As stated above, it didn't work on my phone because the built-in camera./video app wasn't compatible, not because the mics were faulty. The other mics I had, had the same issue. So I researched BingGPT for a solution and got the idea to download another camera/video app. Open Camera. I did so, set the Audio Source setting to External Mic. It worked on the mic I replaced BearVlog with.BearVlog contacted me apologizing for the inconvenience znc offered to send me another mic to test out to see if it would work. i accepted on the condition that if I found out that it still didn't work, I would keep the 3-star rating and send it back, only because they reached out and tried to fix the situation. But if it did work, I'd revise my rating to 5 stars, for the same reason but also that the mic worked with my phone.5 STARS all around! They sent me a mic, I tried it out and it works perfectly. Not only that, but the sound is more clear and superior than what I had on the mic I replaced it with. It's a much better product, even without the box with a magnet opener in which the two mics can be charged. The four rubber/plastic covers are a nice touch to make the mics less prominent in the videos. Also, the fuzzy covers are cool, although I doubt I'll ever need them since I do my videos indoors, but you never know.I haven't even checked the other features (noise cancellation, range, volume control, etc) but just the fact that the company was willing to go the extra mile, and the fact the product sounded great, earns from me 5 stars.",

The reverb control lets me adjust my voice depth. They're also plug-and-play, no need for apps. During a stadium Vlog, the battery life amazed me. The included USB-A converter expands recording options on my computer.",

                "reviewText": "Tested these briefly and found the sound quality to be very good. The case is great, charging the two mics while not in use. Easy to use. However when you plug it into the iPhone you don't know if it gonna work because you get no indication on the phone. The instructions says open your app to use (what app)? Guess they mean whatever you are going to record with not something they have. They do have good recording volume and distance. I set up the phone in one room and took one of the mics two rooms away - about 40' and the recording was great. Only a couple of things take away from a 5-star review. One is minor, the LED on the receiver is on the narrow edge and its very small. it doesn't face you during a recording so you can't see it when you are using it during a recording. A flashing light indicates that the receiver hasn't made a connection with a mic. Once the mic is turned on the tiny RED LED goes on solid. But its only one LED so you don't know if you have both connections active. The biggest issue I have is that the iphone to receiver connection is so short that it doesn't make a connection with the protective case. This is a $1500 iphone. I use it on a gimbal, I don't want to risk dropping and damaging it because this $20 thing won't connect with the case on. This is a Spigen Tough Armor case.",

Called Amazon tech support. They didn't know much and tried to get me put through to the vendor again. They said I might hear back in 48 hrs. No thanks. Didn't work. Can't get timely support.
