After removing my video board problem persisted.Eventually I found the board would consistently fail in Windows Memory Diagnostic, but only if you ran the very slow test for hours. Much time was wasted. Not a memory fault, a hardware failure.No bios available for days as the download site was down for 'maintenance'. That was two wasted days. Was just _unacceptable_.This was the last chance I was giving ASUS.Once they made quality hardware.They built a brand.IMHO they've been running their brands into the ground like MTD mowers for 15 years now.No ASUS brands ever again. I've spec machines for work before and likely will again.I really should have dropped them after the last laptop, but laptops are a sideshow.",
