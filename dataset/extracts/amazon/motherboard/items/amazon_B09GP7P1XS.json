                "reviewText": "This is a really nice motherboard and was an upgrade over my older & much cheaper B450 that I, by a tragic mistake, dropped (literally) and accidentally broke. Visually, this ASUS motherboard I\u2019ve replaced it with is stunning, much nicer than my last motherboard with larger & better looking heatsinks.For clarification, I bought the WiFi II version of this motherboard. Software-wise, well, I couldn\u2019t get the WiFi or Bluetooth to work right away, but I found the required drivers included on a DVD. After inserting the DVD, there\u2019s clearly marked drivers for the WiFi & Bluetooth. Unfortunately for me, the files didn\u2019t seem to work in Windows 10 for Bluetooth, but it did for WiF, which was more important to me. Windows Troubleshooter couldn\u2019t get the Bluetooth to work, and the drivers I tried from the ASUS website didn\u2019t work either in getting Bluetooth to work. Anyway, it\u2019s not worth returning over or going to great lengths to troubleshoot outside of the windows Bluetooth troubleshooter, as I had a cheap Bluetooth adapter I bought for $5 years ago, which I just plugged in and it worked right away. One of the first things I did also was disable the \u201carmoury crate\u201d auto-download in the BIOS. I thought that for a nearly $200 motherboard, it was strange there were even such bloatware options in the BIOS on top of included Bluetooth I couldn\u2019t seem to get connected to anything. That was something I more expected out of a motherboard in the barely-over-$100 price range.It\u2019s still a 5 (or maybe 4 1/2) star motherboard to me because despite the two little complaints I have about the motherboard, it still functions very well, handling a Ryzen 7 3800X with my H100i cooler quite well while also looking great. The RGB lighting on the motherboard looks great. WiFi works very fast with the included drivers on a DVD. (Although, in 2024, I\u2019d like to maybe see drivers located on a cool USB) I had more fan headers on the motherboard than I had fans, which was nice.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Beast of a B550 board",
                "reviewText": "This board, with Windows 11, now supports Bluetooth 5.3. It has 3x of the 4-pin CPU power connections and some beefy VRMs.I run a 5900x with a 180 EDC and the VRMs are of a high enough quality, along with good enough heatsinks, that I start off pulling 180 watts and continuously pull 180 watts with a 180 amp EDC. 180 watt PPT is just what it hits under this specific test as that is where the 180 amp EDC limit hits.It has limitless options. You can fine tune every.. single.. RAM timing there is. It's handling my 5900x with 2x 16GB DDR4 3600 C16 DUAL RANK RAM with zero issues. I realize the IMC is on the 5900x, but the board plays a role in this, too.I also have a 6700XT with SAM enabled. I've had zero crashes despite using that high EDC and Curve Optimizer with a 125mhz boost on this 5900x.Great board. It's a B550, so it will have B550 limitations on the lower end of the board, but ALL B550 boards are identical in that way. It's the chipset that handles the lower PCI-e slots, the lower M.2 slot, etc. It has PLENTY of slots that are well placed, 6x SATA ports, and actually has 2x internal USB 2.0 connections which was nice, because I need one for my Corsair HX1200i to monitor the power draw on the rails. That left me with another one for the 2x USB 2.0 slots on the top of my case, and then the USB 3.0 is there, too, so I have 2x USB 3.0 slots up top. I wasn't able to have all 4x slots on my last board.Asus is hard to beat and that's all I buy when possible. Board has been great. I've been through every single BIOS without any issues whatsoever. Flashing is SUPER easy.I mean, what can I say? I have the 5900x, RAM and GPU I mentioned, along with all 140mm fans, half powered by the board, a Fuma 2 Rev B piggy backed onto one fan connector... 3x SSD's, 3x HDD's (2x in RAID 0) and an M.2 NVME drive (Samsung 970 Evo Plus). I use the built in Wi-Fi AND have an Asus PCE-AC56 Wi-Fi card in one of the PCI-e x1 slots. I can connect to the internet on one and do... things I won't mention with the other.I've had zero issues with this board. Absolutely love it. Can't wait to get a Samsung 990 Pro and use the PCI-e 4.0 x4 M.2 slot for that one. I love full featured boards like this because I have tons of peripherals and need all the USB ports I can have. Handles everything absolutely fine.Would highly recommend to anyone looking at B550 boards. MSI makes good boards, too, but Asus makes the best.",
