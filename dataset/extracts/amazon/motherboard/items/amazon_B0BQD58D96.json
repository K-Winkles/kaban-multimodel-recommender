Windows 11 will continue on its own.There are plenty of RAM choices to match with the board and Asus support page is excellent for finding a CPU and RAM for this board.Make sure you install the Asus Armoury crate as well, there were quite a few updates that will clear up your Device Manager.I haven't tried overclocking the CPU yet, but the XMP1 profile is working fine and I haven't had any crashes running any games.Disclosure: This review, in part, is for the extended 90 day warranty available through Asus.",

I kept having problems getting a LAN connection and the mouse wouldn't work. After hours of frustration where Windows could not get an internet connection to install, I tried Alt-Tab and found another window open in the background in addition to the Windows installer. It was a pop up box asking if I wanted to install the ArmorCrate software. I clicked yes and like magic the mouse and LAN were recognized and the install finally continued.

                "reviewText": "Asus was once a brand I loved and trusted, both their tech and their customer support. That is sadly no longer the case, I had left Asus a few years ago over similar problems as these and though it was time I gave them a second chance. The motherboard looked as good as all had made it seem and the first setup was going great all save one thing, the new DDR5 memory was running 800MHz lower than it should have. There was much to this new BIOS that had been put under new headings, terms and a large amount of new things for the new chipset so I was unfamiliar with it. I shrugged it off and figured I would sort it out after Windows was installed and all the drivers. There was to be no solution and several other things that should have appeared for the chip I had bought did not. I am extremely disabled and apon calling Asus I found myself confronted with one confounded employee after another. I was told that I would then get a call back from the higher tech team that could help me in an hour or so and I wouldn't be sent the motherboard questionnaire because of my disabilities and hours on the phone, the tech team would have called me back even if I had not managed to finish is I was told. I then proceeded to wait expectantly for the next 3 hours, the remaining time of their open hours that day and no call came. I was out of commission dew to my body for the next 24 hours and once I was able I check my email not expecting anything from Asus and there sits an email from some guy and to this point Iail had only delt with women. The email said that I needed to fill out this form and send it back so that the higher tech team could recreate my problem in the lab, the attached form was for a WIFI card!!! Called the next day asking to speak to a supervisor, I was flatly told no, I repeated saying why this time, again but rudely this time NO! I was then forced over the coarse of the next hour to work the entire motherboard problem with him! He stopped, blaming the entire problem on me having checked my memories part number and it not being on their compatible list! Two other before him had checked and they said that it was correct I questioned him. I asked for further assistance but he was done helping me and wanted to end the call, I said that I still need to speak with a supervisor, once again but nastily this time he hissed NO! Two more times I plied him that it was only about what happen with my previous calls and he kept insisting that I didn't need a Supervisor because they would just tell me the same thing he did about the motherboard. Finally I said look it's not about you ok, I am not going to get you in trouble. (It most certainly now was and I most certainly was going to!) He relented saying \"let me see if one is available\" I thanked him. He came back saying he had a supervisor and he would connect me, I sighed in relief. I relayed everything that had happened to me in everything, the pleasant supervisor promised that everything would be looked into and delt with and that I would never have such a thing happen again. After making sure that I was ordering the right memory for same day delivery and noting the account we ended the call. The new memory came a couple hours later and I put it in then booted it up. Once into the BIOS it to was running at 4000MHz which was wrong, I worked the problem as one who has been building computers for 30 years would and found that not only did it start of the same it in fact was much worse than the other memory! I called Asus back getting a nice sounding lady, I asked for a supervisor and she ask me why? I replied that my case required one where things left off last and that I want to pick back up with one again. She said, ok no problem can I have you name and case number to give to them, I said sure and she put me on hold, I thought to myself \"well that was nice for a change. A few minutes went by as I began to think this is taking a long time to get a supervisor just as she came back on the line. All politeness now gone from her voice, now decidedly negative and discourteous she barked at me \"After reviewing your case you don't need a supervisor! You need to send us the motherboard if it's still not working on an RMA.....\". I had never said the exact reason for my call only that I needed a supervisor and it was related to my case. I would tolerate the abuse from ASUS NO MORE and hung up, I had the motherboard for 5 days and it was clear that it was bad out of the box so I returned it and in formed Amazon of the whole sorry affair. IN FINAL REVEIW IT'S SAD THAT IT WASN'T JUST THE MOTHERBOARD THAT WAS BAD BUT IN MY OPION ALL OF ASUS HAS GONE BAD! BUYER BE WARE!!!",

                "reviewText": "ASUS did a great overall build with this board.Issues: NIC and RAM---This is an overall great board, with the notable exception of the 2.5 gig Intel i225/i226 network chipset, which a lot of manufacturers are putting in Intel-CPU (especially Z790) boards. The i225/i226 chipset DOESN'T PLAY NICE with any Verizon hardware. Something to do with IPv6 support; Verizon's routers won't see the NIC, and the NIC won't register any connection. A simple $20 Realtek PCIe or even USB network card solves the problem immediately, but you need to know that going in.My only other complaint is the one-sided memory DIMM clasps. I find that it's much harder to install RAM when one side of the mounting slot is rigid/fixed, instead of having folding tabs on both sides.Features: Everything else on this board was solid out-of-the-box!---During the bios boot process, the mobo persists a VGA signal so that the monitor STAYS ON during a reboot. This is such a nice feature because it lets me know it hasn't hung! When performing a long reboot, e.g. to enable XMP or change some overclock settings, the logo sticks around so the user knows the system's still \"doing something\". Nice.Speaking of XMP, I was able to get a full 128 gb of DDR5 RAM working at the advertised 4800 MHz clock speeds with no issues. The CPU is also clocked correctly, and the power scaling of the processor itself, and the system as a whole, is very smooth. System sleeps and wakes with no issues, and low-power states don't seem to mess with other \"nice-to-haves\" like LEDs or other peripherals.Plenty of options for LEDs, not as much for SATA drives. The M2 mounting points are robust and the heat spreaders seem like they're nice hefty aluminum to dissipate the heat.Takeaway:All in all, this board was NOT A HEADACHE to get running at full capacity, and that's more than I can say for most motherboards I've installed in the last decade. Do recommend.",

There are lots of plastic film covers on various parts to keep it from scratching during install/shipping. Remember to peel them off as you are installing.It has some LED lights that can be turned on or off in the BIOS. Speaking of BIOS, Asus motherboards always have nice, clear and easy to use BIOS software. This one is no different.One feature that I likes (but also hated) was that the screws in the M.2 SSD heatsinks were attached to the heatsink. It makes it easier for those with bigger hands to get the screw in place. In the other hand, it also made it difficult to line the screw up with the hole. I feel like there could be a happy medium there.Finding the Windows drivers was pretty simple, but on first boot, you are prompted to install the Asus Armoury Crate software. It let's you control/view the fan speeds, LED lights, see the temperatures, install latest drivers and more. It's actually a really slick idea, but the software itself is awful. It takes up a lot of memory and it crashes all the time. I suggest installing it to get the fastest drivers, then uninstall it right away. NOTE: You will need to use Asus' Armoury Crate Uninstaller tool available on their website to completely rid yourself of it.So far, I haven't had any issues with the motherboard itself. Hopefully it stays that way for a long time.",

                "reviewText": "Honestly, i was not looking for the best motherboard out there but this one did seem to tick off a lot of box's i was trying to get in my next build. (First in 10 years for personal)- Intel CPU socket, Wifi, Bluetooth, overclocking, high speed DDR5, 2X or more M.2 slots, (this has 4) more then 3 system fans and then CPU fan, [4 pins] (this has 1 CPU 1CPU alt 1 AIO and 4 System and all are 4 pin connections) it also has 4+ sata connections (for old hard drives and data ->sadly, only has 4X) and ARGB connectivity. (This has 3 ARGB Aura Sync connectors for easy cable managment)CPU i bough i knew was not going to have integrated graphics so the on board graphics ports would not be used in my case but good to know this option is offered on this board.I do no like the top PCIe16X slot placements. Top one makes it so if i wanted to add a 3 fan addon to the rear of my GPU to pull head up and away from the PCB board then it wont fit (or at least with the one i had purchased) and the bottom one is too close to my battery box so IF i say wanted dual GPU's that were 2 slot cards, then the bottom one cannot fit with the case i picked (tested with my Asus TUF 3060 just to see) sure, another case option may differ for you.All in all this board is great though, my choice in tower is more of an issue then anything at all on this board. I slapped it together in about an hour and it just worked. the motherboard takes about 10 seconds to boot bios and show the TUF logo for the first time and it kinda made me question myself for a second (I have not changed it yet but i think there's a fast boot option) (*UPDATE: Not that i could find)My RAM, CPU, Motherboard, and M.2 NVMe SSD combo works extremely well and would highly recommend, after TUF logo goes away windows login screen comes up in 3-4 seconds then after i type my passcode and press login, my 15 startup programs i use load only another 8 seconds have passed XD i have 0 complaints.wish i knew how tall my M.2 heat sink was on my Fire Cuda 530 1TB before i bought it because i could not put the shield back on after i installed it so for those i recommend NVMe SSDs not have heat syncs else they may not fit.The ARGB on the board itself is very suddel and with a lot of other ARGB things in a case you cannot even notice it.",

Como pueden ver en la imagen no hay refuerzo en la mother para el conector.Tambien note que las cubiertas para el backblate, chipset y VRM son de plastico de mala calidad, y ni siquiera el branding de TUF esta embebido, son estampas.Solo recomiendo este producto si no busca a\u00f1adidos esteticos comparado con la series ROG, incluso PRIME luce mejor ahora.",
