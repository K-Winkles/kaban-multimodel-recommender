I don't use the PC for gaming and have not for over a decade, having switched to a Playstation 3 on my son-in-law's recommendation just after I built the PC. I've upgraded to a PS4 then PS5 over the years since. But I've used the PC as a programming workstation, SQL Server & webserver for years. Earlier this year I decided to do a motherboard / cpu / memory upgrade on the PC, basically starting from scratch. I'd already upgraded the case, power supply & memory over the years but the tech on my motherboard and cpu was old - really old. This motherboard, a 12th gen i7 & 16 gigs of new memory and everything is much more responsive. Zero log jams on either server running on the same machine. The install for this motherboard was the simplest build I've ever done. Everything basically snapped together & was up and running without any further hassle than a simple bios upgrade. I installed it 4 months ago and could not be happier.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Works pretty good but hard to configure by even an expert. Read the manual on this one . The PCIe 5 slot will not work unless properly enabled on the bios . PCIe 4 storage interface must be configured as well. Neither I or a a local tech where able to build an array as the disks kept disconnecting and disappearing . Once configure as individual disks the system works well runs rather hot and very resent passmark scores in all but memory . Top 70% to 92% based in component . 90 percentile over all. I like it better than MSI boards I tested . This is my top high end pc build",
