That being said I would like to see reintegration of the onboard speaker as well as the DrMos lights. That way for the visually inept people the problems would still be found. Other than that small nitpick Asrock is one of my favorite part manufacturers and I would recommend this board for both Beginner builders and for those seeking a simple test bench.",
