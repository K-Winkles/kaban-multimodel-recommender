I was really worried. I even started to look at B650's and 670's before it arrived just in case this motherboard didn't work or had issues and I had to return it. Well, so far it's rock solid, as advertised, had none of the issues others have reported, and hope I'm not jinxing myself with this review, but it's an amazing board. 6000mhz RAM in EXPO running perfectly. Everything installed easily. Great motherboard for the price point.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this motherboard for an upgrade to my system using a new Ryzen CPU. Overall I have been satisfied with the product.The previous board I had was a MSI Gaming M5 for an Intel 6th gen CPU. I liked a lot of the features, ease of use and the UEFI which led me to stick with them on the second go around. The X670-P WIFI didn't disappoint either.To start, There are a lot of things I like about this motherboard:-Simple UEFI/BIOS that is easy to find what you are looking for without spending too much time in.-MSI Center software that lets you easily monitor system specs, you can also add/remove certain parts of the software that you may or may not need which is a big plus for me.-Multiple Fan headers and dedicated header for a AIO pump, this is pretty standard on most boards these days but you can never have too many connectors for fans with newer cases seeming to have more and more each generation. (8 Total headers)-USB headers and connections, there are (2) 2.0, (2) 3.2 Gen1 and (1) 3.2 Gen 2 headers. I have only used a single for my case but like there are is plenty of options.-RGB connections for 3 and 4 pin, gives a lot of compatibility between RGB components right now.-Quality of the board and the finishes on the heatsinks feel very sturdy and premium. The overall aesthetic is nice and can go with many color schemes.-4 M.2 Slots provide plenty of expansion of drives, M.2 is quickly becoming the go to for storage so having several to use is nice for the future.There are a few things I do wish could be added or improved, although most of these are preferences and probably not the opinion of the majority:-The newer motherboards seem to be favoring LEDs that indicate failures in the POST, my previous MSI board had a counter display that could give specific error codes and would display the CPU temp during normal operation. In the ~$200 USD price range this seems like it would be a reasonable addition.-No options for boards without the built in Wi-Fi on the higher end, this is probably an unpopular opinion but I use wired connections for my desktop and just ended up disabling anyway. I'm sure there are plenty that enjoy this feature but would be nice to have a cheaper model without it.-More USB A connections on the rear panel as there are (6) with (2) USB C. The USB is great but I still have many peripherals that use the older A type and would be nice to not have to unplug, use a hub or get an adapter to use the type C. There are multiple headers so some cases may alleviate this problem with front panel connections.Overall, I really like this board and its features for the price point. There are not a lot of X670 chipsets that can be had for this price and for that I think it adds a lot of value. I have not had a lot of time to really dive into all the settings on the board and test, but haven't found any performance issues yet. Most of my complaints are minor and therefore I will still give it a five star rating. If you are in the market for an X670 AM5 board, I would strongly advise considering this one for the price point and included features.",

I bought this board based on reviews here and other sites that painted it in a pretty good light. Better than most we'll say. However, my experience was absolutely horrible. I bought this along with RAM directly from MSI's QVL list and a 7800X3D CPU. First board would not post boot with GPU installed. Just straight refused. It would work with the onboard video but if I plugged anything into the PCIE slot it wouldn't do it. No amount of bios tweaks or flashes to other non beta bios (which would then introduce more bugs) would let anything work in that slot. So I returned it. Got another one thinking maybe I just had bad luck. Well the second one double down on that and I could finally get it to post with a GPU installed. However, now I couldn't get a clean boot twice, let alone a proper restart. And then the USB headers would randomly drop out. And forget about using EXPO. I've built a lot of computers over the years. I've never had such a terrible time trying to get a system to just work. It was atrocious. I've never used MSI before and I can safely say I won't now. I sent it back and replaced it with a Steel Legend (ASRock who I've used in my last few builds) and had zero issues. Looking back most of the positive reviews I've seen have been from MSI rebate program members and maybe a couple people who got lucky. This board isn't worth the lottery or the headaches.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for the purpose of upgrading my PC as I am planning on editing in high quality raw footage and I wanted my computer to keep up with the demand. The board itself looks very interesting with its design and it was very easy to install into my case. So far in terms of editing and gaming, I have experienced no issues and it has worked flawlessly. If you are looking for a good higher end board that is both sturdy, well designed and capable then this is a decent choice. The only downside I have about it is the placement of the CPU power port is a bit awkward for cable management. I recommend running your wire behind the case and going over the top to look nice.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this motherboard only as a result of a failed motherboard (Gigabyte X670E Xtreme) and because MSI's Godlike version was unavailable.Installation of this motherboard was very easy though I struggled a little bit with the BIOS layout. I wanted to use RAID for my two 2tb M.2 drives and it was really hard to find out information on how to go about this. Luckily, I had recently gone through this process with the Gigabyte motherboard so I successfully made it through the RAID setup. Once Windows was installed, the AMD update software automatically ran (due to the BIOS setting which permits it). So slick and easy though after rebooting a bunch of times (after updates), there was one device that remained unrecognized in Device Manager. I ran the AMD Chipset installation once again and it cleared up the problem.Overall, it's a great motherboard and I'm super happy to have my new system running great.",
