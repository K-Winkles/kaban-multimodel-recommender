I'm not sure if its the board, the ram, or just cause I've never done it before, but it was the only scary part of the build. Everything else went smoothly and looks great, the Bios is pretty easy for a noob to navigate.",

                "reviewText": "Pros: very fast board made a good home for my 13600KF . Boot times are very good. In comparing this to the MSI Z790 Tomahawk Max , that I had to return , it beats it hands down In fact ANY of the so called \" Z790 refresh \" boards have no real reason to exist . Case in point Any of those boards that support a NVME 5.0 SSD do do by cutting Your graphics card down from 16x to 8x. So if You use ANY SSD in the M.2 PCIE 5.0 slot Your Graphics card will suffer I see that this Z790 Pro is pretty much Identical in bios options compared to the Z790 Tomahawk . So why pay more ? Fully supports all MY RGB lights and does it well , but no RGB on the board itselfCons:The board I got shipped with full support for 14th Gen CPUs BUT it shipped with a Bios version A.60 which is VERY buggy . In fact MSI took this version down due to problems. Be sure to have Bios version A7.0 . This is the best version according to many posts on the MSI forum . A6.0 will cause the OS to crash . Minor con, The bios boot screen and bios color scheme are all in black and white , no color at all.Oh and finally , No User manual , I had to print My own . MSI cheeped out , and makes You scan a QR code on Your phone. Come on MSI Really ? ( rolleyes)",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Works great - but you may want to tweak a few settings",
                "reviewText": "Pros:\u2022 Aside from an issue with a certain TV I was initially trying to use it did POST and get to the BIOS screen after I plugged in a PC monitor.\u2022 Windows 11 install was fine. Ethernet port worked out of the box for immediate connection to the Internet and no driver install required that Windows doesn't handle automatically. i.e. Windows 11 just works when installing from USB.Some minor nits that I'm giving it 4 stars for. But after tweaking, it's a 5-star experience.Nits:\u2022 It recognized my 13th Gen Core i9-13900 on first POST. The BIOS version was a 2022 version. A bios update was required for it to enable the XMP profiles on my RAM. (I only used 5200mhz Corsair RAM). I already anticipated all this and had the updated BIOS ready to go on a USB key. It was easy and painless to update the BIOS.\u2022 When you first get to the Windows desktop after installing the OS, the Windows Platform Binary Table of the OS feature will attempt to run an MSI specific EXE from the motherboard. This will prompt you to install the MSI Software Center. Honestly, you should to decline to install it and/or disable this feature from the BIOS settings. Otherwise, it puts some bloatware on the computer like Norton 360 trial edition, outdated versions of CpuID, and some cheezy software. And the MSI program would often show up in the task manager as one of the most active programs. Again, without all this, Windows 11 will put on the latest stable drivers including Nvidia GPU drivers. I wound up doing a clean install of Windows 11 so this stuff wouldn't get laid down at all.\u2022 Most important. On the first bios update, a dialog pops up on the BIOS screen asking you to declare what type of cooler you have: \"box\", \"tower air\", or \"liquid\". Given the graphic for liquid showed an AIO cooler similar to mine, that's what I picked up. DO NOT pick \"liquid\". This has the side effect of setting the Long Duration Power Limit (PL1) and Short Term Power Limit (PL2) to unlimited. This has the effect of running any popular benchmark software program such as Prime95, Cinebench, CpuID, etc... to have the cores hit the 100 degree thermal limit within a minute. I seriously thought my AIO cooler wasn't working at all. After some research, I experimented with setting the cooler profile in the bios between \"box\" and \"tower air\". \"Box\" runs your power limits to match Intel's spec and then you won't hit those high temperatures at all. If you want a little overclocking performance without taking a risk, you can do what I did: Set \"tower air\" as the cooler profile and change the thermal throttle cap from 100 degrees to 95. That should solve most of the issues around high temperatures and Core-i9 processors with this board. You can also lower the long term power (PL1) to be slightly lower than PL2 and lower the transition time. YMMV.",

Only exception would be the audio one which is on the bottom left.Some of the M.2 slots may get blocked by the graphics card so be aware of that.Be careful with the RGB pins as this was the only part of the product that I almost damaged during installation.BIOS is straight forward for the most part. BIOS flash worked as advertised.Overall I can not complain about the price to performance that this board provides.",
