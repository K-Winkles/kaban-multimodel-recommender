                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Decent power supply with awesome RGB lightning",
                "reviewText": "This is a pretty awesome power supply. It is perfect for any gaming rig provides that your power supply slow is not on the bottom. The reason being is the fan for the power supply is on the bottom so if you have a power supply slot on the bottom, you cannot take advantage of the RGB lights. That being said the RGB lights are absolutely beautiful. It blends very well and if you do not like the lighting you can actually turn it off which is nice. The fan is not too loud. It keeps at a pretty good noise level. It is not dead silent but it's not too heavy on noise that you will notice it. This provides 600 watt worth of power which is more than enough for more gaming rigs short of powering two graphic cards. In terms of connection, there are several connectors. Unlike many other high end power supplies you cannot remove to make cable management easier. There are several connectors. The main motherboard and cpu connector are always a must. There are five sata ports, three molex and two pci-e plugs. The pci-e ports are connected to the same wires. What is nice about this is that the PCI-e and the CPU cables are color coded so you can tell them apart easier. The CPU port is red and the PCI-E are green so you do not get them mixed up when trying to plug it in. It was able to provide my gaming rig with all the power it needed. I am running an i7, 1080 TI, 16 GB of ram and several hard drives and it runs pretty well without issue. The power supply does not get too hot or anything so you do not have to worry about it burning out. The cables are all long enough to work well in a full size tower and all the connector are secure. Overall I think this is a good power supply for any gaming rig given you are not running more than one GPU. It has an option of controlling the LED lights and is not too loud. It comes with the four mounting screws and the standard power cord which feel a little flimsy but it works. The light show is nice and not too bright. If you have an RGB gaming rig this is definitely going to fit into the theme.",

                "reviewText": "Just install this power supply into any computer, and boom! Anybody within a 500-foot radius will hear the loud noises from the power supply, shriek, and run far far away. My house is now free from all mosquitoes, termites, cats, annoying roommates, and more!(Detailed version)I was building an AMD RGB computer for a friend on a budget, and I was looking for a cheap PSU. This was one of the cheapest power supplies I could find on Amazon for this price point, so I went ahead and purchased it. The installation was easy; the PSU has worked flawlessly for her so far. I loved the look of the PSU in her computer, and at that time the PSU in my computer was starting to fail. I bought another GAMEMAX PSU for myself.Initially, the PSU worked great. It looked awesome in my RGB computer case, and it shot out tons of air out the back. Over time, though, the PSU started having problems. The fan would vibrate, stop, and make a high-pitch buzz, and my computer would frequently crash. As I was still in the 1-month return period, I gave GAMEMAX the benefit of the doubt and returned it, replacing it with the same PSU. My second PSU (that I am using now to type this review) hasn't had the same issues as the first. The fan still makes the vibrating noise (it must be typical for this PSU) but I don't have frequent crashes. Overall, 2/3 of these power supplies have worked for me. I would recommend this if you are on a strict budget but not if you can afford a PSU from a more reputable brand.Additional note: the PSU's eco mode is a button switch and not a flip switch. Eco mode cannot be permanently turned off; it always turns on every time you boot the computer up.[Update]I just bought another one of these PSUs for a different computer and that one works fine; now 3/4 of these have worked for me. Several of them are still emitting very annoying noises, and I believe they are coming from a faulty fan. I wouldn\u2019t recommend these for anybody; save up and get a better PSU instead.",

                "reviewText": "My old beloved Corsair850 blew in my old PC from a lighting storm, so I wasn't particularly looking forward to the cost of having to replace it. Came across this unit, read some reviews, and placed my order.First of all, I could care less about lights and stuff like that. Not my thing, but this was actually kind of cool and nifty. Unit installed like a charm, and once connected, everything worked perfectly and as it should. I was impressed the unit also came with a \"dummy plug\" for pre-testing the 24-pin connector. I had never seen that before. Changing colors is quite easy as well. There were PLENTY of cables for various connectivity options - whether you are using newer components or older 4-pin power cables.All in all, the unit is a great value for the money, and...it's QUIET!! No obtrusive fan noise!I would highly recommend this unit!",

Nice sleeved cables which are color coded. Shipping was delayed 4 days for some reason. But that's understandable with what's going on in our world. I was lucky enough to pick it up on sale, But I see that the Psu is $75Cdn now. And for that price you may be able to purchase a Semi Modular Psu. Not complaining @ all! As for the gift code....It doesn't work.Update! PSU in eco off is only 480 watts, about 410 in eco. So if you expect to run a higher end card or over clock, This psu won't cut it. I know because I updated to a higher end V card and found out the hard way. Not saying it's a bad psu....Just make sure you know what you need for future upgrades!",
