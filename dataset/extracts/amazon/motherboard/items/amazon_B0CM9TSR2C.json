                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Tool-less design of M.2_1 socket is terrible, but otherwise a great mobo",
                "reviewText": "This is the second of three Ace Max motherboard I've ordered where the M.2_1 socket cover was so hard to remove that I thought I might damage the motherboard trying. It's supposed to be a tool-less design where I push a button, raise the cover slightly, then slide the cover to the left to remove it. The problem is, the cover does not easily release from the button's catch, so it took close to 30 minutes for me to finally slide it loose. Since the other 5 SSD socket covers on the motherboard still require small phillips screwdriver to remove, I don't understand the added complexity of the tool-less design for the first socket. One motherboard had no such problem and the cover came off easily, but the two other motherboards were a nightmare. One I had to return because I could not remove the cover at all. But aside from this one issue, I like the other motherboard features. An 8-layer PCB like the Godlike at half the price (but only a 2.5Gbit NIC (x2) and not 10Gbit like the Godlike), dual bios is nice, as is the flash bios button. I've used the Z490 and Z590 Ace which is why I chose the Z790 Ace Max for the 14900k. Just wish they'd not used the tool-less design for the M.2_1 socket. So instead of using the M.2_1 socket, I installed a Crucial T700 gen 5 SSD in this system (M.2_5 socket only). Because of Intel only having 16 PCIE gen 5 lanes and no fault of the motherboard, this forces my GPU into an x8 lane status if I use a gen 5 SSD. I knew that wasn't going to be an issue for this build and wanted to maximize SSD I/O. I'm getting 9356/sec write and 7330/sec read speeds with the Crucial T700 gen 5 4TB SSD.",

Su punto fuerte, comparado con otras placas es su dise\u00f1o t\u00e9rmico, teniendo la temperatura del procesador menor a 50 grados corriendo juegos demandantes como Diablo 4, por ejemplo.Lo \u00fanico que no me gust\u00f3 fue que la placa m2 shield no soporta dispositivos m2 con disipador incluido, y reci\u00e9n me di cuenta de ello en el momento de armar la PC.",
