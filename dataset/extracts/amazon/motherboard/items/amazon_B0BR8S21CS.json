                "reviewText": "Not For Inexperienced. If you are considering assembling your own computer and you are not experienced in this task I would not recommend this MB since there is a dirth of information about this MB. The printed User Manual consists of 12 pages of basic rudimentary data. The on-line manual is essentially a repeat of the same info. The User Manual contains no information on the BIOS and states to contact ASUS support web site for BIOS info. There is no BIOS information on the web site. By comparison my ASUS X79 MB came with a 100+ page detailed assembling and BIOS data User Manual. The User Manual lists a number of software programs that are included with the MB. There is no CD/USB with the software included with the MB. A session with an ASUS Chat agent was unsatisfactory since he could not tell me where the software was or how to get it. There is a card titled, \"ASUS Control Center Express\" which requires scanning two QR codes to access the program and instructions. Not useful if you do not have a way to scan the QR codes. Final note - the advertisement for this MB states there is three months free access to Adobe Photoshop. There is no information on how to obtain this promotion.UPDATE. After a couple more unsuccessful emails with ASUS support to find the software just by chance I discovered that by clicking on the \"Expand All\" option at the top of \"Driver\" list the rest of the software that is included with the MB was displayed.",

If you have an older case, buy a USB 3.1 connector/front panel with the appropriate header. The connectivity was the main reason to purchase this, along with the creative cloud bundle.The promo did not work using the Asus website. I tried using IE, Edge, and Firefox (with no extensions), and it failed each time. A customer support ticket has been submitted, but if you are looking to buy this motherboard for the offer as shown in the listing, just note that this purchase failed to activate using their website. Will update this review if the bundle works.",
