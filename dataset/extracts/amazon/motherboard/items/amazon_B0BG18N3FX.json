                "reviewText": "Obviously this motherboard looks good, and has a lot of great functions to it, but the way it is designed caused a fitment issue for my GPU. I have a EVGA 3060 TI, a gpu that is very normal sized, but the shielding on this motherboard prevents it from latching properly, I guarantee with larger GPUs this problem is worse. I resolved this issue by actually shaving off some of the gpu shroud so it would fit better, keyword is better, it still doesn't latch in all the way.",

Haven't used the wifi much to comment on that.***! Make sure you have access to internet and download the proper ethernet and wifi drivers from NZXT's website beforehand, during my windows install I couldn't connect to the internet while plugged in through ethernet. Had to use USB internet tether from my S21 phone. That worked and once I installed the drivers, ethernet and wifi/Bluetooth worked.NZXT's Cam software is...ok I guess. Cannot control my Tforce memory rgb with it, and the options for the 5v 3 pin header settings are a bit hidden. Otherwise the fan control works well enough. I imagine if you are using their other products like Kraken cooler and whatnot, it would be much more useful.",
