                "reviewText": "This is a great, reasonably priced mother board with lots of useful features and plenty of PCIE 4 and M.2 ports. It also comes with an ip shield and plenty of usb and data ports. The buttons for flashing the bios and the troubleshooting lights are also very handy if your pc ever has issues. I do kind of wish it had some RGBs but it isn't the end of the world. The inside of my pc case is just a little dark (I only have a cpu cooler, ram, and from rgb fans that light up the case but now I'm looking to get some RGB strips too.Also: this motherboard supports Corsair RGB lighting with a built in connector for corsairs proprietary connector, so you can hook up their corsair RGB hub and connect all corsiar fan RGBs to it and use mystic light to control it. Sadly mystic light does not work with the cpu corsair cooler RGBs which connect with a usb port on the motherboard so I still had to download ICUE for that.The MSI bios and the Dragon Center software are both also very good and easy to use. I saw lots of complaints about the older version of dragon center but the newer version is VERY easy to use and the mystic light built in software works great with almost all of the RGB components in my pc, including my corsair k95 keyboard (it didn't show up at first in mystic light but eventually it did and it fixed a lighting issue I had with that keyboard and the ICUE software, which I hate). It also has easy to use settings for simple overclocking in both the bios and in dragon center.After 2 months of use:Recently I had my computer stuck on an automatic boot loop for \"preparing automatic repair\" with the MSI MEG logo on the screen. It took a long time to try to fix it and I wasn't sure if it was the motherboard or Windows that took a crap on me. I couldn't get it to get past the loop to get to windows repair but I eventually online saw someone suggest to overclock the cpu if you had previously had it overclocked so I tried it and it booted up but then it had some issues with randomly restarting at the MSI MEG logo booting screen and then back to the lock screen for windows. I eventually reset the bios after I managed to do a windows repair and it seems to work fine but I've still been worried about possible issues. It has since worked fine and no longer randomly restarts since I reset the settings after overclocking it to get past the boot loop, I'm hoping for the best though. Since it could have just been windows I'm leaving it as a 5 star review but I suspect I was an issue with motherboard, it would also sometimes say the gpu wasn't detected or failed (gigabyte geforce rtx 2070 super) during my attempts to get past the boot loop. It was a pain to try to fix that boot loop issue.About a month since the first boot loop issue I had it happen again. And before that my PC would randomly shut off and then just reboot from the black screen with the MEG logo and then it would go right back to my windows login screen like my PC restarted with and all previous applications that were running would be closed. It did that for two weeks leading up until this boot loop again. I've already tried reinstalling windows and that didn't fix it and I've updated the bios. Only thing I can think of is that the motherboard is faulty or maybe the ram. I think I'm going to see about having this swapped with it's warranty to see if that fixes the issue. I'm very frustrated and have honestly thought about just buying a gigabyte or another brands motherboard if this doesn't work.I have also tried putting in a usb drive with a fresh copy of windows and set the boot priority to that usb stick but it still boot loops and won't try to reinstall windows with the windows downloader on the drive made with the windows media creation tool.FINAL UPDATE:After RMAing my motherboard that did not fix my issues. I tried my friends ram (3200 vs my 3600 which requires xmp to be enabled) but that also didn't change anything so ram, motherboard, GPU and PSU were all fine. I then warrantied my CPU and that fixed my issues. I'm not sure if my cpu was destroyed from my motherboard or what but the issue for the most part was most likely not caused by the motherboard. I do LOVE the bios, msi software, and features and overall this is an amazing motherboard and I am quite happy to say how good this motherboard is. I really liked the board and everything about it so it's a relief that my problem was not the motherboard.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this when I decided to finally make the switch to AMD/ Ryzen over Intel. I am a gamer, streamer and mine bitcoin on the side.This motherboard supports my 1200 watt PSU, RTX 3090, RTX 2070 Super, Ryzen 9 5000x, Corsair Dominator 32gig (4000mhz), NVMe SSD, all while maintaining impressive temperatures. I do have a push pull fan system consisting of 11 fans that helps but overall the board does a great job on its own.I am an RGB person so I'm not gonna puff my chest out about how manly this board looks.. I bought it for the features at a good price (which in this case is due to lack of RGB). I have enough RGB to make up for the lack of it on the MOBO itself.As a former ASUS user I will say I find the BIOS software to be meh in comparison -- but MSI knows overclocking and cooling so I moved to them for that reason.Comes with 3 m2 slots although I don't use all 3.I don't see it mentioned a lot but it has a type C port which is super clutch.My 2 nitpicks.The front panel USB port being horizontal instead of vertical on the board makes it a little rough to connect in some cases.I have seen this board flash the good ol '0d' error but only when I'm screwing around in the case. It seems a bit sensitive with your DRAM so taking your sticks out and putting them back in fixes this for me. Just make sure you flash the CMOS which I almost guarantee people who have this issue do not realize. FLASH/RESET CMOS solves a lot of headaches.Overall as a heavy PC user this is a great mid range MOBO ( creeps into mid range at this cost point due to lack of RGB) that comes ready with current gen features including advanced cooling, 3 m2 slots, PCIe 4, type-c port and great overclocking potential.Cryptomining, Gaming / Streaming -- this board can take your hardware to the next level for $100-$200 less than the typical mid range board.I just wanted to comment that if you are having any issues with RAM overclocking like a lot of x570s did make sure you have the latest stable bios. My board came a version behind and no ram overclocking was possible (stuck at 3200 mhz) untill I upgraded BIOS and now I sit at 1900 fclk and 4000 mhz.",

                "reviewText": "Very happy with this board. The I/O shield being pre-installed worked out well for me and my case (Fractal R5). Stability has been solid and everything went together well. Got my RAM running comfortably at 3600 MHz with a Ryzen 7 3800X. I love that this board has NO RGBs or other LEDs other than the power button on the board itself and it also has a CPU temp LED on it but that is it. No other annoying lights or other gimmicks.Capacitors are all Japanese Nippon caps. Top quality stuff. My old MSI board from 2010 is still running strong to this day with the same capacitors and it was used and abused a lot. The headers and other parts are also solid and also all of the slots and other areas of the board. The PCB is thick and doesn't seem to flex which I always check for. My only other advice would be to install your M.2 drive right away, its very awkward to install one after you put the GPU in unless you want to use the lower slots or you have to remove the GPU to make space.The BIOS is typical MSI, has not changed much in the 10 years I have used them. This one is slightly improved but nothing fancy. I personally have no issues with it, but some people may prefer Asus or another brand for the BIOS and configuration.Overall this is definitely a sweet X570 board that was worth the cost and probably the best one out of all the brands I reviewed if you don't want RGBs or other stuff and just want a minimal and simple design that is still feature rich for modern rigs. If you want RGBs, look at the MSI Ace which is priced similar to this board and on-par quality wise with similar VRMs.Edit: Update Oct 2022 - Still running perfect. I did a BIOS update last month, and now I can install Windows 11 if I want to. I am going to wait for a while to install because it's buggy, but this board will support Windows 11 if you need to install it any point.",
