The major benefit for gaming is its ability to have a dedicated graphics card, although not a powerful one. It works fine for games that are not too demanding. Keep in mind that being a small and semi-mobile package, it is not meant for high-power devices. Try to keep the box from overheating. As long it is used as intended, its form factor, stability, and performance are great.",

This seems to be a problem for MSI only. I have brought this to their attention. Tech support rates a 3. There's one guy there, who has no patience for people. If he's gonna do tech support, he's got to have patience, otherwise I'd put him on service detail to fix stuff. As a person who is totally blind, you have to ask what's up on the board. I've been building computers since the late .80's. It's truly amazing how far and how much stuff they can stuff on a Mobo. Anyway, this Realtech console binds the audio to whatever connection you are using. If you say unplug your headphones going back to speakers, it might work or might not work. This is installed during the Win10 process. So before you do anything else, go to the start menu, and find that sucker, and uninstall it. I returned a couple of boards before I knew what was going on. Anyway, these boards work well, and I have no other issues to report. So far, I'd buy them again. Ray",
