                "reviewText": "I bought this motherboard to build a PC for my father-in-law. He races on the weekend, and loves looking back at his recordings. He edits videos and puts them on youtube, then goes back to watch them on a daily basis.When his old PC failed, he wanted to go buy a new one at best buy. As a custom/DIY obsessed geek, I had to convince him to let me build him one and get more performance for his money. After doing some research, I determined the Ryzen lineup was the way to go for budget performance.I'm not very familiar with anything AMD, so this was my first non-intel build. For a PC that didn't need all of the bells and whistles, I wanted to get a board that wouldn't cost a bunch more for a bunch of bells and whistles that would never be used. Once I ran across the ASUS TUF lineup of boards, I was pleasantly surprised by the affordability.Fast forward to the assembly and testing process.I got the board, the rest of the parts, and went right to building. The board seems sturdy, and has the luxury of looking like a high-end board, what with fancy heat sinks, 802.11ac wifi on board, displayport & HDMI outputs, LED headers, and USB-C/Gen 3.1 ports. I grew up in a time where wifi included in a board was only for the highest-end custom build boards.Installation was a breeze. Goes the same as any other board, as expected. The only thing I wasn't expecting was that the DDR4 slots install a bit differently than most other boards. Only one side of release tabs will move, the other side is stationary. Once I figured that out, everything went well.I got it powered up, and the BIOS control screen was very user friendly. For a budget board, it's nice to have a BIOS with a well built GUI. Secure Boot 2.0 controls made it easy to get Windows 11 installed and running without a hitch. As most new boards go, drivers weren't much of a necessity to get all of your features and motherboard components working properly.If I end up with another budget AMD build to do in the future, I'll stick with this ASUS TUF board.",

While mine did arrive DOA, the company quickly sent me a new one, and within 2 days I had a brand new one. I do not live anywhere near an Amazon warehouse. I am beyond impressed by this company; the board feels sturdy and nice. It is a bit tight, though its an MATX, so that's expected.Some things to note.The board does not come with motherboard screws.The IO shield is a little weird and sometimes would go into the ports when I was installing the board which I assume was a user error.Other than that,. The company is phenomenal, and I would definitely recommend going with ASUS for any parts you can afford to pay a bit extra for. You are paying for their phenomenal communication and customer service, as well as their reliable parts.",

Also the rgb on the motherboard is really bad, it always has like a green rgb when you want it to white or something like that though it\u2019s hard to in the picture. I\u2019m still trying to get the aura sync to work but that\u2019s on me not the motherboard. So i would sorta recommend if you know how to get everything setup and get you wifi to work!",

This worked out of the box with a Ryzen 5600g. The only thing I had to change in the settings was that by default it was running the DDR4 3200 at 2666mhz but it was easy enough to change it. One issue I ran into is that the port for the on and off switch is further back than normal so the cable for turning the computer on and off from my case does not reach it. I have used the same case for about 15 years and have had several other motherboards and this was never an issue. I had to remove the switch from the normal location of the case and have the wires hanging out of the side of the case.",
