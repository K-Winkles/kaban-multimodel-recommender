                "reviewText": "This has been very stable. My initial configuration had some RGB memory and Ryzen 5 2600. The RGB memory didn't work well, so I checked the ASUS website for their HCL (hardware compatibility list) ... sorry, their QVL (qualified vendor list) ... and ended up with Corsair LPX 3600 memory. Amazon was understanding. Also, I was one of the first ever people who advertised Corsair on the Internet. And I am one of the first people who stated that ASUS was one of the best manufacturers ... before Google or Amazon even existed. So this is a good matchup!Now, I recently updated my BIOS to the 4002 version, bought the , and then swapped in a new video card for a 2021 refresh. Most of my pictures are from the 2019 install, but the 5900X makes a cameo appearance at the end.Problems with this board: the memory slots and the default Ryzen cooling fan get in the way. So if you have tall memory and the slower CPUs that include the fan, you might have to carefully rotate the fan and heatsink so they don't hit the memory. I like the Corsair LPX because they are shorter. I also was able to get them to scream at 3600 MHz (their XMP rating) once I installed the 5900X. And instead of my original 16 GB, I now have 32 GB and they work well at the higher speeds enabled by the 5900X. I am using Doc OverClock and the recommended memory settings boost. While I had lots of problems with any overclock settings with the measly 2600, the high end processor allows everything to go fast.Next year, when PCIe 4.0 devices are more common, this system will still be relevant. While I have some beefs about layout and a few features of the motherboard, I'm very pleased at this price point. Looking forward to go to Samsung NVMe storage.Pro Tip: always check the ASUS QVL for CPU/memory compatibility.",

                "reviewText": "Long story short, this was my fourth motherboard in a string of three others (other brands and models but all x570s) that were DOA. I have this up and running for over a week and it is performing as it should. It is the only one of the group that is WiFi capable which is a feature I do not need/use. Irony, right?It has the features I was looking for, but it would have been better if it had two 3-pin addressable headers for RGB devices. The second NVMe slot comes with a heat spreader/sink but since my drives already have their own, I had to leave it off the build. Not a big deal.I use air cooling so the thoughtful headers for AIO type cooling are nice to have if I ever decide to make the switch.Compared to the other three fails (2 MSI and 1 other ASUS) this is a solid performer and handles my Ryzen 7 5800X with 32 Gigs of Corsair Vengeance RAM with no problems. The BIOS is easy enough to navigate and allowed me to set things as I wanted them. I am not an overclocker.It does have a small RGB light on the back of the board which makes for a subtle display inside my all white case. I have not yet explored if that can be turned off. It does stay on with the PC off. I have to switch the power supply off to have these lights off. But again, I have not explored other options, such as in the BIOS, to have them turn off when the PC shuts off. It is no big deal for me, but perhaps it might be for you. I am just happy to have a board that actually works!It is the heart of my new gaming rig. I went with a MSI RX6700XT and paired it all with a nice LG 32\" 165Hz 2K monitor and I never knew how great my games looked until this setup was operational. I upgraded from a 10+ year-old rig running a FX6100 and a 1050Ti - I know, a museum piece. I love the new speed and power this board affords me. I am a happy gamer. I hope you are as well!",

                "reviewText": "I was a little worried after I got the box. It did not advertise AMD 5000 series. Looking at the information on the website it also suggested it may need a bios flash. This model does not support flashing the BIOS using AMD's processorless system. Yet it advertised it at the top of the page on Amazon. So I was nervous going into the build.I can confirm that the BIOS revision included here supports it perfectly fine. I installed an AMD 5800z with no issues. Booted perfectly fine.Temperatures in the case are great after the install. No issue hooking any of the connectors up. If I was going to complain about anything here it's the software downloads from ASUS's website. They don't have everything in one package. Everything you need is half hidden in different categories. Also the cabling for the included Wi-Fi antenna is not very long. Maybe only about 3 ft.Other than that I'm very satisfied. Performance seems excellent. Efficiency is really good. Overall really happy with the board.This motherboard series from AMD produces a little less heat than many of the other 570 models. That's a huge plus.",
