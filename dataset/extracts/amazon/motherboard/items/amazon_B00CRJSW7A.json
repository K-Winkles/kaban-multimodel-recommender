                "reviewText": "This was my first PC built, all from scratch. This MOBO turned out to be surprisingly easy to use. After the built and when I connected monitor and turned on the power I got ASUS BIOS screen.I am using this PC for nearly half a year by now and no problems. I installed 2 hard drives (WD Blue 1TB Desktop Hard Disk Drive - 7200 RPM SATA 6 Gb/s 64MB Cache 3.5 Inch - WD10EZEX), from one I am running Windows 7 Pro, from another Linux Fedora 22. Linux is great, all drivers including ASUS drivers were already built in. For Windows I had to install them from enclosed disc. No problems with ASUS but beware of what Windows you buy. I got them from reputable source on ebay, plenty of excellent reviews, installed them and registered them using phone. No problems here but in two weeks I started getting message: This is not genuine Windows! Further research showed, the Windows was not intended for a new mother board PC.I have this PC on my private home network using Netgear AC1750 WiFi router. Both Windows and Linux like the router.Installed memory is four sticks of Kingston HyperX FURY 4GB Kit (4x4GB) 1866MHz DDR3 CL10 DIMM - Blue (HX318C10FK2/8), total of 16GB. My wireless device is TP-LINK TL-WDN4800 Dual Band Wireless N900 PCI Express Adapter,2.4GHz 450Mbps/5Ghz 450Mbps.DVD drive is Asus 24x DVD-RW Serial-ATA Internal OEM Optical Drive DRW-24B1ST . Power supply is Sentey Xplus Power Supply 725 Watt (XPP725-HS). Case is Antec Three Hundred Two Gaming Case. I really did not need such a big case but I had a discount and the case is excellent.I have also installed PC Internal Mini Onboard Speaker by ENLIGHT to beep diagnostic warnings. Works just fine. Two external speakers are made by Logitech. Processor is Intel Core I3-4160 Processor 3.60 GHz, 2-Core LGA1150 Socket, Hyper-Threading (BX80646I34160). Good workhorse for what I need.I would highly recommend this motherboard.",

It supports HDMI, DVI-D, VGA .It is a Micro ATX form motherboard so it will fit most, if not all the common cases out in the market right now.I give this a 5/5 as it fits everything that I had intended on getting and is also a great deal.",

                "reviewText": "[UPDATE: 5-12-2015] This board was nothing but trouble. II tossed it in the trash and replaced it with an Intel DH87RL which booted the first time, recognized all the memory. I say this every time I waste my money on an ASUS board, this was my last purchase of ANY ASUS product.Original Review Junk. Typical ASUS junk board. Just one of the MANY problems with this board is the memory handling. If you populate the B channel regardless of the speed rating of the DDR3 modules, I mean regardless, the board locks in 1333Mhz for the entire compliment. I bought 32GB of 1600 Mhz memory and installed in the board. When I go to the BIOS it inexplicably shows 1333 Mhz. Hummm I think well maybe the memory was defective or mislabeled so after hours, AND I MEAN HOURS, of testing (putting memory in different boards, running memory diagnostics) I learn the pairs of 1600 Mhz memory both work in the A channel as expected. So I try just for grins and put 1066 memory in the B channel and sure enough the BIOS shows 1333 for all the memory. Next and even more annoying is if you have anything in a USB port while trying to boot, the board hangs. It will not boot anything USB based except a CD/DVD attached to a SATA connection. And the list goes on. ASUS will say I have a defictive board and send me a new one and it will do the same thing or have a totally new problem. My time is worth more than screwing endless with support people and moving boards around here and there. Hours will pass in the end I will have an unstable system that I know will always have some problem. I planned to save TIME AND MONEY by throwing this in the trash because it is trash. This is a recurring theme with ASUS, either it works flawlessly or it is plagued with funky problems that never go away. Anytime you buy an ASUS board you are rolling the dice: coming out with a 7 it will be all good, if you are on the point you will crap out.",

It had to be a socket 1150 as an i7-4790K was going into it. I considered a Z97 but the budget cut into that and so I settled on this one. Installation went well and without any problems. Another consideration was the need for a MB that would be able to take a number of hard drives as I had four to place in it. (They went in with no problems.) The CPU was installed and on boot the board \"saw\" the CPU and even set the voltage right, right off the bat. The memory went in without problems and registered correctly on boot. Installation of Windows 10 went off without a hitch and the system rebooted when completed to the OS. The system was stable and has been running smoothly since completing the installation. This looks to be a good choice for this build...",

                "reviewText": "This is a phenomenal socket 1150 motherboard. I have built about 10 computers using this motherboard so far. It has a full battery of video outputs - DP, HDMI (both support 4K but at 24 Hz only), DVI and VGA.It is rock solid stable for years. It has a good amount of USB ports, 6 SATA ports, 2x PCI-e 16x slots, etc.The motherboard is a B series Intel board so it doesn't support CPU multiplier overclocks, but otherwise it's got great power delivery to support any quad core 1150 CPU. It uses high quality Japanese capacitors for the CPU.Because the B series are intended as \"business\" boards, it even has an antiquated PS/2 port for old keyboards and mice!I have stopped using full-sized ATX motherboards years ago - I even ran this in my main machine with a GTX 980 and i5 4670 with 16GB of RAM. It ran like a dream!",

Si buscas una tarjeta madre modesta para un presupuesto bajo es recomendabre ya que puedes instalar sin problemas un CPU y GPU potentes ademas de contar con 4 ranuras para RAM; por este precio la mayor\u00eda de MOBOs cuentan con s\u00f3lo dos ranuras. Si consideras usar varios ventiladoras es necesario comprar splitters ya que que solo cuenta con dos puertos para disipacion y el puerto para CPU FAN.",
