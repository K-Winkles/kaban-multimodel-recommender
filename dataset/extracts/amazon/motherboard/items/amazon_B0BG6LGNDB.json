                "reviewText": "I have lost count on the number of ASUS motherboards I have purchased through the years. Not once have I ever been disappointed or had buyers remorse. This Z790-P is no exception. I just completed an install for my primary DAW PC for my studio and this board was a perfect fit for the bill. The system booted right up and recognized all of my hardware. Windows 11 installed without a single glitch and I was up and running in no time. The layout of the board is well thought out and fit nicely in my 4U rack enclosure. The installation manual was well written and explained all of the necessary connections making the install very easy. I have had no driver issues and my DAW software and audio applications all reloaded beautifully. I also encountered no issues with the BIOS and found it to be intuitive to navigate and was consistent with other ASUS boards. For reference I used an Intel i9 processor (LGA1700) and 32 GB Corsair DDR5 memory. I am not an over-clocker and I did not purchase this board for gaming. I opted to use the onboard video which will serve my needs quite well. This is another successful ASUS PC build and as long as they keep making quality motherboards I will continue to keep using them exclusively for all of my future PC projects.",

I couldn't see anything at the mark in the photo they sent.how can there be a physical damage to the CPU socket when I never removed CPU until the motherboard stopped working? and they ask me to prove the damage is from the delivery if not me?I think they just make any excuses to refuse to repair by warranty.plus, the ASUS customer service is EXTREMELY slow. and not very communicative. I had to wait for a long time to use my computer again.I know it's not the seller's fault. but too much headache with the motherboard. No ASUS again.",
