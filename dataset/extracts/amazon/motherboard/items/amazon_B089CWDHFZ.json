                "reviewText": "my last pc i built for myself was a fx6300 on an old msi military board now 20 years old. cleaned it up gave it to a family member. yes it is still being used daily and so when i went to build my new pc it was a no brainer for me to go with msi again. this thing is heavy like a brick. came new no dents dings or cowboy boots. so yeah read about these \"warning lights\" going nutty ect. that concerned me and there is no documents that explains how they are to work. should they come on then go off ect. so i used a known bad hard drive. yup the light lit up and stayed on even though the drive was acting fine. it knew there was an issue. i used that drive till it died and yup the light never went out. so i put in a new m.2 and 2.5 ssd as well as two 2 tb hard drives. now the lights come on first the hard drive then the graphics then memory. then one at a time as it boots up then they go out. before the lights go out it has to see the whatever and make sure its there and ok then out they go like clock work. now could you get a board with an issue or maybe using old parts with unknown issues? of course that is what these lights are for and how i :think: they are to work. was i afraid to buy this? yes i was! would i suggest this board? after the use of this for a month bet your booty. this was the best i could do price wise so if you are in a tight spot building price wise and this fits the budget. get it! i watch voltages ect but i do not overclock never needed to. this board has been running great no magor voltage issues or fires lol used with a 3700x and 32 gigs 3600 ven.have seen where others could not get this ram to run at these speeds. read on one article that had like a cpl sentences saying to only install one ram stick as you set up and the rest after you after finished. the first time i used all ram and it didnt run them at these speeds so whatever the one stick thing does if anything would suggest trying that on a fresh install. as for me the second install that way worked... just why i have no idea. i play e sports and triple a games. this has not had one issue or made me scratch my head asking that age old question (ram thing aside)... now what the hell are you doing! LOLonly thing new to me on this board is rgb and argb thing and right off the bat i made the mistake>>>WARNING<<< i bought a three pack of thermaltake rgb fans. was all the best buy had nearby. of course it needs the usb plug but my wifi needs it as well as my front panal connections. that lead to the purchase of \"Motherboard Internal USB 2.0 Hub 9 pin USB Header Male 1 to 4\" wich you guessed it needs the usb pins. just read how the signals are split on this thing. i placed the wifi on the mb. i set the rgb hub on one side then the font panal on the other side so signals are not sharing or splitting one side in half.",

However, this mobo makes it so easy, the little quick install guide provided a super easy install for those connectors.The shield is connected already, feels sturdy and fits everything nicely. I am rocking a 3070, wifi card, and Ryzen 7 5800x and no issues.Sound card seems fine, not sure what the other reviewer was talking about.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this board, a Ryzen 5 5600X, 16GB of Corsair LPX Vengeance RAM, a 1TB Samsung 980 Pro, an EVGA 750 GT Supernova PSU and threw it all into a Corsair 4000D Airflow case along with an RX 580 I had lying around. Everything works fine..It was very easy to build on this board. It is quite heavy and does not flex much at all. ATX fitment is superb. I love the fact that this board can be flashed without a CPU installed.My only concern is that one of the mounting holes (the one closest to the I/O shield) is pretty tough to get to without a magnetized screwdriver.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Great motherboard, solid build",
                "reviewText": "This review is for the MSI MAG B550 Tomahawk motherboard. I purchased one for $179 in January 2022, and it has been a solid performer. I paired it with an AMD Ryzen 5 5600G processor, 32 GB of G.Skill 3200 RAM, and an EVGA 750 watt power supply. The board is well-built and has a solid, hefty feel to it. Installation was a snap, and the user guide includes ample diagrams for component locations, pin-outs, and connectors. I flashed the BIOS before install for the new 5000 series Ryzen processors (a simple process, well-documented on the MSI website), and I didn't have any issues at start up. The Ryzen 5 5600G processor comes with a Wraith Stealth cooler, and removing the stock cooler bracket (4 screws) was a cinch, then just mount the Wraith cooler with 4 screws and done. After a 48 hour burn-in session I've been running the machine from 8 to 12 hours a day for over a month and I haven't had a single issue. I do mainly gaming, music and video streaming, word processing, and web browsing. CPU and board temps have not gone above 85 centigrade even when gaming. There are 6 SATA ports, which is plenty for most mainstream rigs, and plenty of USB connectivity counting the motherboard ports and front panel ports on my case. If you're planning on hanging a ton of USB devices off your board you might want to look for one with more connectivity, but for most this board will be plenty. I'm no audiophile, but I know what sounds good, and the audio from this board is great for music, movies, and gaming. The PCH and M.2 heatsinks are a nice touch, and the minimal amount of LED lighting on the board is pleasant and low-key. I haven't yet used a dedicated graphics card (waiting for prices and supply to ease), nor am I using the M.2 slot (I have 2 SATA drives installed). The UEFI Bios interface is presented well and provides mutiple memory profiles and overclocking options for those who are so inclined.. I haven't overclocked the board, but I did bump the RAM speed from the stock 2166 up to 3200, which improved my gaming frame rates. I'm happy with the price, features, and performance of this motherboard. I deducted one star from my rating because I'm not happy with MSI's policies. In order to register the warranty they demand that I install the Chrome web browser on my computer and create a user account, and I won't do that. They don't offer any other options for registering the warranty. If they want to form an unholy alliance with Google that is their business, but they won't dictate what programs I install or what web browser I use. I may or may not ever buy another MSI product, but I am pleased with this purchase.",
