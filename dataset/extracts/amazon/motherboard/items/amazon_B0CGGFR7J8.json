I also used and have been using Crucial products for many years and never had any issues. The Crucial products are known as they are good quality and affordable price range. Crucial Pro RAM 48GB Kit (2x24GB) DDR5 RAM kit is also proof of that. This is a high-end and very well-made RAM kit and the amount of the total RAM is weird. I am not complaining I just have never seen a 48 GB RAM kit before. I saw 4-8-16-32-64 but not 48 so that is new.If you are even a little bit familiar with computer hardware you will able to change your old RAMs with this Crucial kit. It is seriously a 1 minute job. Just before getting this RAM be sure that your mainboard supports DDR5 RAM modules. You do not really need to worry about 6000MT/s (or 5600MT/s or 5200MT/s or 4800MT/s) part. If your mainboard supports DDR5 it means you will get 4800MT/s for sure. That is the default clock speed for DDR5 RAMS. As you see this RAM supports 6000MT/s which is awesome for gamers or people like me who love high performance. Long story short this is a fantastic RAM kit and totally worth it for your money! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

                "reviewText": "2023-10-05. RAM kit by Crucial. 48GB (2x24GB). DDR5. 6000MT/s. Downclock capable. XMP 3.0. EXPO. 1.1V. 1Rx8. Black.The boast about this latest RAM kit isn't so much the speeds as it is the power. The Crucial Pro DDR5-6000 memory kit boasts high bandwidth and low operating voltage.Using Micron integrated circuits (IC's) in printed circuit boards (PCB's), this RAM kit by crucial features a low profile design enrobed in a minimalist matte black aluminum heat spreader to cool it.The kit is also compatible with both Intel & AMD memory profiles provided the central processing units (CPU's) are DDR5-enabled. The appeal of this kit seems to be ability to start at a very low 1.1V, and reach much higher frequencies and/or lower timings without scaling to the 1.45V that many other kits do. The result is increased longevity due to lower operating temperatures.While they're not the fastest on the market at 6000MT/s, and operating at 1.1V is common for DDR-5, what isn't so common is putting the two together. DDR-5 kits typically operate a 1.1V when left at JEDEC 4800MT/s speed, so delivering 6000MT/s within the same power range is pretty noteworthy.Where this kit falls short is with latency. Timings are set at 48-48-48 which are by far no where near the best on the market today. A DDR5-4800 at CL38 has about 16ns latency, there should be no reason why this 6,000MT/s kit running at CL48 can't do the same delivering 48GB/s bandwidth (about 9.6GB more than the DDR5-4800.)Overall, as an out of the box kit, this set will serve you well provided you don't need low latency; however, if you do require tighter timings, there are better options out there.",

                "reviewText": "It works and that's what matters in the end. I'm no hard core gamer or overclocker but I do build many PCs every year. Swapping out memory is pretty much the single easiest upgrade you can make to your PC, so of course installation of this RAM is a breeze. A strange amount of RAM, but that's not a knock, just an observation. Everything runs great but it all ran great previously too. Funny thing about RAM, you only notice it if it fails or you don't have enough. You really only will notice the RAM upgrade if you're doing RAM intensive tasks like I do. I run drum VSTs with my Roland vDrum kit and the samples get loaded into RAM so that when you strike the drum pad, the sample comes out immediately with little to no latency. When I first started using drum VSTs years back, it was common to see kits max out at around 750mb - 1 gb, which was a lot as 4gb of RAM was the norm then. Now I've got VSTs where some of the presets are close to 8gb (Superior Stories comes to mind). I've also got 3 Roland kits combined so I have to add additional kit pieces on top of that, so I've got some kits that load up to 12gb into RAM. You need RAM above and beyond that in order to run the PC too. I'm constantly upgrading RAM to keep up with the progress and bloated sizes of VST samples in all things music production, so the 48gb upgrade from 32gb is welcome.",

But regardless, 48GB DDR5 RAM with 6,000MT/s transfer rate really can't be beat. Really happy that I got the opportunity to try this out, and it booted right up in my test machine. Looks great took with the black aesthetic. Not much else to say - if you're in the market for this type of RAM then you can't go wrong with Crucial branded kits like this one. 5/5!",

What\u2019s in the box: two (2) 24GB DDR5 6000MT/s Desktop Memory modules.First impressions: I purchased this SSD module to complete my build of a high-end 3D CAD modeling and rendering desktop for my engineering business; this type of modeling is extremely CPU and memory extensive swallowing tons of bandwidth. I have been using CRUCIAL memory for 30 years and it NEVER disappoints. This memory uses the latest in cutting-edge technology (no surprise here) and incorporates an integrated aluminum heatsink spreader to dissipate generated heat under load. The cooler the electronics run, the more stable and have a greater effective service life.How did this product perform? Blazingly fast and rock stable. I dropped these two puppies into my ASUS ROG Maximus Z790 motherboard with zero compatibility issues. As advertised, you noticeably get almost double the bandwidth and speed over conventional DDR4 RAM which makes a huge difference in rendering in 3D models.Cost-effectiveness and value: Overall I am extremely satisfied with the product. At a current price of $225.99, I feel it is great value for the quality and functionality delivered. Some people may think that this is expensive but you get what you pay for if you want the best quality and superior reliability.In summary: the \u201cCRUCIAL PRO RAM 48GB Kit (2x24GB) DDR5 6000MT/s Desktop Memory CP2K24G60C48U5\u201d made by CRUCIAL is the \u201cCadillac of RAM\u201d, dependable, blazingly fast, and most importantly stable under high transfer rates.
