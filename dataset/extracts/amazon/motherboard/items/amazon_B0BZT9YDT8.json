I settled on this mobo not because I wanted to but my options were limited since I wanted quality, power and white. This mobo is more silver than the advertised white. It still looks great in my build and didn't sacrifice my aesthetics too much. I love the RGB logo that stays on all the time and so far it's lived up to it's performance expectations.",
