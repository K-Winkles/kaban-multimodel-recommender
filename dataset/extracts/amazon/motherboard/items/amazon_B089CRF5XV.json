This is actually the first I've heard of it, because my old B550 board (an MSI MAG B550M BAZOOKA) was absolutely fine until I messed up flashing the UEFI/BIOS and turned it into a paperweight. Sad. But with this board the internal USB 2.x headers don't work and sometimes will pop up repeated error messages in the Windows 10 notifications. I had to disable the sound of USB connect and USB disconnect because it was constantly going off. But I do not want to be without my PC, so I am dealing with it until I can budget a replacement/upgrade (preferably without the B550 chipset).",

I did a bios update via button (since the mobo can\u2019t recognize Ryzen 9 out of the box). Tried many bios versions and kept getting the Ez debug CPU white light. Then I thought it was my hardware, but that wasn\u2019t the case. Assuming all of your hardware is good, make sure you try a different usb thumb drive with the bios on it before giving up! On my first usb drive, even though the bios update process seemed to work, there\u2019s really no way to tell that it was actually successful. I had to try 2 additional thumb drives until it worked. Also read on forums that this has happened to several people. Also start with 1 ram stick in the second slot from the cpu. Good-luck and I hope no one else goes through this. Hardly any answers online to diagnose this properly.",

                "reviewText": "PROS for MSI as a CompanyOverall, as you can see from the below, I don't write fake reviews. I write the good ones when earned and negative ones when deserved. In my opinion, MSI has earned 5 stars. They made a lifetime customer out of me by exchanging my 1st motherboard and now that I am building my 3rd system, I took a look at at its main competitor's reviews and decided to stick with MSI. I had previously bought MSI because it was cheaper than the big competitor but now I'm paying equal value.INSTALLATIONApart from plugging in the Power / Reset switches, installation was extremely easy. Performance is excellent but for Ryzen 5 3600 and CPUs in that family, make sure you search the MSI web site for (1) bios update (2) driver installer. Without bios update for some CPUs, you'll be stuck on the bios settings at bootup.FEATURESThe ARGB works using the Dragon Center with my Ryzen 5 3600x, no surprises. No weird shutdowns.Drivers install easily through windows, or are not needed if you use Ubuntu. The temp and voltage monitor through MSI's Dragon Center software is good and non-intrusive.Lots of fan connectors and a lovely and precise side plate.RAM slots are accessible with even larger CPU coolers, though you might have to install CPU cooler after inserting the RAM.GPU slot will make your video card overlap slightly with one of the M2 slots and so your storage. [Update - A few months later, have not noticed any overheating issues.]And finally, the 2 x M.2 slots for storage make this mobo a good catch.CONS(1) The 550 board needlessly exists because you can easily use a 450 with A4, and if you want better performance, you can buy a 570 for not much more.(2) I am not sure if any other motherboards in this price range offer different options for the power/reset key, but it would help to lock down those connectors! They are basically just pins sticking out, with wires attached, and if one detaches, it is painful to put it back.UPDATEBeen shopping around for a second similar build and not finding any motherboards at a better price with all these features--including 2xM2 slots, 2xPci16 slots. Performance remains awesome. You'll pay at least 15-25% more for the same features with other brand names beginning with \"A\" :)",
