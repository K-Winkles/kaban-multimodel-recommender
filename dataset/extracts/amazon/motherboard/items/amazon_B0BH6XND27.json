I've had 6 different Gigabyte boards from a Z390 on a 9700k to this board I just bought last week. I've myself never had a serious problem with any board from Gigabyte before. The worst problem I've seen was forced to use PCIE 3.0 on the videocard that used 4.0 on a board that had 4.0, that was fixed later on in a BIOS update. Other than that they've been stable, higher than usual amp ratings even on there lower tier boards Elites, Pro's. Better than normal thermals, never had to worry about thermal throttling even when over clocking.Just great all around.And, I can't say this about any other brand. ASUS nothing but trouble I've had three of there boards none lasted over a year if it worked at all. MSI is 50/50 with 2 of there boards I've used. The only other brand I'll recommend but still don't have the same confidence, is ASRock been really surprised with them lately. Packed with features, and been good but only had two different boards with them. So gigabyte has my vote when it comes to motherboards hands down. Hope this helps your purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Motherboard arrived and appeared to be working okay\u2026 at first. Then the black screen crashes began. I unfortunately got a rev 1 board, and those things are notoriously busted. It shipped with the F1 bios installed which doesn\u2019t work with current gen 3 ryzen cpu and every bios version before F6 is apparently a big security risk. It stayed booted long enough for me to use the gigabyte control panel (do not recommend) to update the drivers and the bios. Well, it decided to only update to version F3 and not the most recent f9 and the black screen crashes continued. So I flashed the bios to version F9 and the crashes continued. I did a bunch of other troubleshooting to try to get the thing to work and never found a solution.Also the software it recommends to keep it updated is their gigabyte control panel. It\u2019s filled with bloat ware and offers the RGB software RGB fusion 2.0. This software was garbage and offered very limited options in addition to frequently not working. It would only turn on half the leds on any given fan in addition to causing my front fans to flash bright white before going back to whatever I programmed them to.My problems were not limited to just me as I found multiple other forum posts that described the same issues. I would give it 0 stars if I could.",

It has everything you need, works fine out of the box, EXPO 6000 cl30 activated without any issues or additional settings.\"Only\" one additional PCIe slot, and \"only\" 2 M2 ports (one gen5!) due to it being mATX, but who uses more anyway?Installed a 7800x3d, a MSI 4090 and 1000w MSI PSU in a breeze, without any issues so far. Got 1.1 rev with F7 bios, bought in December 2023.",

NVME gen4No issues with updating bios to the latest and EXPO ram settings.Only issue I have is sometimes the computer takes way longer than expected to boot up from a cold start. Maybe 20-30 seconds before it goes to desktop. I see a red light is on, on the mobo. I think it's the ram. Googling shows this is possibility caused by EXPO settings. Its weird bc if you didnt know any getter, youll think the computer is locked up. But other than that, it is lightning fast.My board is Rev 1.2",

Faced a black screen after rebooting and it took me some time to log back into the system. Apparently half of my USB 3.2 ports (only blue ones) and Bluetooth were fried for good, nothing I connected to them would work. Front panel Type-C was fried as well. Said ports still deliver power, but there's no data transfer between them and stuff I tried plugging in.There also was a noticeable coil whine under load coming from motherboard's VRM (I checked everything and it wasn't the GPU or PSU).Good things: apart from these issue, things were fine. Boot times were very quick compared to anything I've read about online.",
