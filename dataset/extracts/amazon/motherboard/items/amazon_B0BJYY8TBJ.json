                "reviewText": "I recently upgraded my gaming rig with the ASRock Z790 PG-ITX motherboard, and I couldn't be happier with the results. This motherboard packs a punch in a compact form factor, making it an excellent choice for small form factor builds without compromising on performance.The build quality is outstanding, and the attention to detail is evident. The motherboard's sleek design adds a touch of sophistication to my setup, and the RGB lighting customization options allow me to personalize the aesthetics to match my taste.Performance-wise, the Z790 PG-ITX has exceeded my expectations. The support for the latest processors, high-speed RAM, and PCIe 4.0 capabilities ensure that my system runs smoothly and handles demanding tasks effortlessly. The BIOS is intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy to tweak settings for optimal performance without being overwhelming for those who may be new to system tuning.I particularly appreciate the robust connectivity options this motherboard offers. The inclusion of Thunderbolt and Wi-Fi 6 enhances the versatility of my system, providing high-speed data transfer and a reliable wireless connection for a seamless gaming and productivity experience.ASRock has also incorporated excellent thermal solutions into this motherboard, keeping temperatures in check even during extended gaming sessions. The overall stability and reliability of the Z790 PG-ITX make it a standout choice for gamers and enthusiasts alike.My only con is going to be the motherboard VRM Fan is a tad loud inside my build. (SSUPD Meshroom S) But with a 3rd party software you can control the fan curve and turn it down a bit to be more tolerable.In conclusion, the ASRock Z790 PG-ITX motherboard delivers a perfect blend of performance, aesthetics, and functionality for those looking to build a powerful system in a compact form factor. I highly recommend it to anyone in search of a high-quality motherboard that doesn't compromise on features.",

This mobo has THREE Nvme drives and I'm making use of all of them when creating video content. The only think wonky about this board is that the BIOS will not allow you create a simple hardware raid. This may have something to do with the Intel chipset and not the board. It's not a deal breaker not to stripe two of the 3 NVMEs together as the throughput I'm getting is already insane.I'm not an overclocker, but I've played around with some simple overclocking provided by the ASRock dashboard. It works just fine, but I'm still keeping it at the \"standard\" setting. I like to keep the temps down whenever possible. Anyway, looks like another win for ASRock.",

Things went well after everything was finally up and running... for about three weeks. One day, the PC froze. After shutting it down, it refused to send a video output. I tried getting the PC back up and running, but finally caved and sent it to a local repair shop. They tested every part, finding them all working... except for the motherboard.I gave Asrock a chance after hearing they'd turned things around. I'll be going with another brand.",

I did a lot of research before my purchase because I needed one with at least 3 nvme M2 ssd slots for my build. I also needed a number of usb3+ expansion ports. It has a lot of expandability, just use a case with a cut out for access to the back of the board to allow you to install 2 of the 3 nvme M2 ssd's. I suggest always using adequate memory so there are no latency issues with multitasking 2- 16's minimal with this board, so you can see how smooth tasks run. I personally use 2- 32's for gaming and video editing. The make of this board is high quality, metal casing and heavy, just what is expected in a serious motherboard.",

                "reviewText": "This is the only Z790 that I've found from a reputable brand (Not Asus), that has TB4, as well this one has 3x M.2 - M key drive slots at full 4.0 speeds, with 5.0 PCIe and far into the 7000MT/s ram support. Really really solid board that has been perfect for my usage and has much of the features of the Z690i MEG at half the price. Had to come to this board after buying the Z660i from ASUS and realizing they designed it to not mount properly with SMDs and solder joints directly below the 115X / 1700 bracket, while no other brand did that. Exceptional work ASROCK!",

                "reviewText": "Despite the most recent bios adding support for Vengeance DDR5 6000Mhz, it in fact does not. Trying to boot with XMP profile enabled or putting it to 6000Mhz causes the system to either crash or boot loop and automatically sets itself to 3600Mhz. RAM runs fine at 4800 but bios documentation says it now supports this kit at 6000 and it does not. Everything else about the motherboard is great.",

                "reviewText": "Was having some trouble with a ddr4 z690 board so picked this up and moved over to DDR5. More voltage options available, more NVME slots available, and intel killer networking. There's been a few bios revisions since I first got it, and all have only made things better.System is 13600k, 32gb GSkill, RX 6700XT in a Lian-Li Q58. Gaming temps below are rarely above 65c, and fan curve is fairly quiet. It was a bit pricey, but It's a solid board.",

(Et Gigabyte autrefois).AsRock a fait de gros progr\u00e8s depuis le temps, ils se hissent assez haut dans le march\u00e9 des cartes m\u00e8res. Autrefois j\u2019ai eu affaire \u00e0 eux, il y a plus de 15 ans, c\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e7a.J\u2019ai choisi cette carte pour faire une configuration en ITX, consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme de l\u2019entr\u00e9e de gamme, son prix devrait baisser dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e. (Achet\u00e9e autour des 400+).Le bundle est assez complet compar\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u2019autres marques, entre les mains la carte reste lourde et semble de bonne facture et qualit\u00e9.On dirait qu\u2019AsRock prend la place de Gigabyte doucement mais s\u00fbrement, je n\u2019ai pas test\u00e9 le service client mais il para\u00eet qu\u2019il est bon. Leurs produits sont bien finis, a l\u2019instar de Gigabyte \u00e0 une \u00e9poque \u2026 (P35 user here).Partie Amazon, faites un effort, l\u2019enveloppe craft pour le transport c\u2019est abus\u00e9 \u2026 On est sur un objet fragile malgr\u00e9 son emballage hein. (Surtout que vous demandez quand m\u00eame qu\u2019en cas de retour le colis soit bien emball\u00e9).",
