The only problem I had was that shortly after the build was complete, I ran into a boot error (I cannot remember what that error was or what caused it); all I had to do was uncheck a setting in BIOS, and I've never had a problem since. I will say that I have not experimented with many BIOS settings nor the overclocking features, so I can't vouch for all that. However, given the features and components that it has, you cannot beat this motherboard for the price. Would buy again.",

Don't want to purchase a different memory but may have to...Update...The Thermaltake PSU was the culprit. Although, the onboard LED on the graphics card would light, I failed to recognize that the fan was not spinning. The PCIe ports on the modular PSU did not work. Used an Apevia Premier 650W semi-modular and everything worked immediately. The status LEDs may have helped. This happened once I switched to a Gigabyte GTX 1650 graphics card which does not have an onboard LED.Conclusion: make sure that all components are receiving power. even brand new PSU can be partially defective out of the box. I made sure to try different cables and both ports on the PSU before deciding that the PSU was the culprit.",
