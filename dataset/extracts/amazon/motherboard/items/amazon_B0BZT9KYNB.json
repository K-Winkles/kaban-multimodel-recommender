NVMe ports were easily accessible during installation, and had lovely clips instead of tiny screws (something I am delighted to see is becoming a standard).The metal shielding on the graphics PCIe port was 'thicker' in appearance without being in the way. I wish ASUS had put the PCIe release further back on the board, but it was not difficult to get to during testing, just awkward.The heatsinks were a little too close to the processor socket for my own preference, but the NZXT Kraken Z73 fit without too much hassle. [Be aware of potential difficulties if you have large hands.]The built in 2.5 Gb ethernet performed well even under heavy load.",

                "reviewText": "I had to return the ASUS TUF GAMING B760-PLUS WIFI motherboard because it didn't fit in the computer my son was building. Despite its impressive features like PCIe 5.0, DDR5 support, and Thunderbolt 4, the incompatible form factor became a significant drawback for our specific build. Ensure compatibility with your case and components before purchasing to avoid similar issues.",
