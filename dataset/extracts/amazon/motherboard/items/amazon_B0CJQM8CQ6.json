                "reviewText": "Used in a budget AM4 build. I was skeptical about the motherboard but because it was backed by a GIGABYTE warranty, I decided to pull the trigger. This motherboard might as well be brand new. Everything came wrapped in an anti-static bag with the I/O-shield, SATA connectors, and WIFI antennae. The only thing that was kind of annoying (hence the 4 star review) was that it was missing the M.2 screws. The standoffs were there but no screws. Fortunately, I was able to find screws that fit in the standoffs, but I would just be wary of this one issue. You can find the screws pretty cheap here on Amazon.Would definitely buy again!",
