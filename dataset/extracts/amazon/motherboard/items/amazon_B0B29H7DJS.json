                "reviewText": "Pros:- Awesome value; a $170 itx mobo with Wifi6, ddr5 support sounds too good to be true; but this is the real deal.- Feels heavy and solid with very little flex. All headers and connectors are very sturdily attachedCons:As another review mentioned, these boards were originally the Z690I Ultra, but there was a defect in the PCIe expansion slot, so the board is only capable of PCIe3x16. This is not a big deal in 2022 as the highest end graphics cards still do not utilize all of PCIe 3 x16\u2019s bandwidth.Weird header placement. This is my only major gripe with this board. The front audio panel header is hidden in a crevice behind a heatsink, that\u2019s inaccessible on the CPU cooler is installed. I didn\u2019t realize this until it was too late, and ended up having to uninstall my CPU cooler, pull up the daughter board pull out the audio cable.There are several other headers (sys fan and rgb) in a tiny crevice in between the GPU and a heatsink. You won\u2019t be able to reach those once the GPU is installed. So if you wanna install a second fan in your chassis, you\u2019ll have to uninstall the GPU first.The CPU power header is in an extremely hard to get to corner (nr200 chassis) it might be easier to attach the CPU power cable first before installing the board.Overall though, the negatives are nothing a little time, patience and due diligence can\u2019t solve. The feature and price to feature ratio far outweigh the cons. Do a little bit of planning before starting a build with this beauty and you\u2019ll be fine!",

                "reviewText": "Received an early build that didn\u2019t support my 13th gen Core CPU. No worries though, because I should be able to QFlash+ the BIOS to update to a revision with gen 13 support. No CPU required! Cool! But wait\u2026. You must have a flash drive. Smaller than 32GB. Formatted to FAT32. MUST BE USB 2.0.I cannot tell you how insanely difficult it was to make sure the 3 requirements were met. It\u2019s 2023, flash drives have been USB 3.0 for over 7 years. They are all pretty much over 32GB. And Windows 10 doesn\u2019t let you natively format to FAT32. After spending over an hour trying to find a USB 2.0 flash drive for purchase nearby + 1 hour tearing my house apart I managed to find a literal 12 year old flash drive in an old backpack. Long since forgotten.Then, I followed Gigabyte\u2019s lousy instructions that leave too much room for interpretation. I consulted numerous videos and Reddit posts trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. Nothing. I tried every BIOS revision, every possible permutation of the flagging process. Nothing worked. It\u2019s now 2am and I have to cut my losses and wait the week for another motherboard to arrive. It definitely won\u2019t be a lousy Gigabyte. I honestly don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever use their stuff again at this point.To make matters even worse, I bought a used version that was missing parts, screws, and had an old cooler brace still screwed on under the CPU socket. It never should have been resold!",

                "reviewText": "That the itx form factor has changed in the past 3 years. Every 3-5 years, I build or upgrade my PC setups, and the last itx case was extremely tight, but I was able to fit in a low profile cooler at least. With this mobo, it's a requirement to do water cooling, which I was planning on doing anyways. The thing is, it took me 3 tries to do it because the clearance is so tight and my cooler had to be rotated twice to get the setup to the point where the water tubes were not being pushed down against the fan.The 2nd worst thing is DDR5 support. As of early 2023, DDR4 is still a much better value than DDR5, about 1/2 the price and probably 90% of the performance. Unfortunately itx DDR4 boards with 1700 socket were not very common to find.All of the other connections are extremely tight. For example, the front HD Audio connector is initially lodged under the m2 expansion pcb. You have to unscrew the layered heatsink and then pull out the m.2 expansion pcb. Speaking of which, the mobo supports 2 m.2 drives, but only one works. I only need one, but having one not work is a real bummer. Lastly, the usb-a connector to the mobo isn't working, but I haven't figured out if this is the case connector or mobo issue.It works, and it was $20 cheaper than the competition, but I ended up spending $60 more on RAM and could have potentially saved more on cooling, and still my new setup is lacking front USB and m.2 expansion. So it's bittersweet.",

I'm using the integrated graphics which has been fine for my needs (so far...).Just one thing to note, you really will need to use the intel cooling fan. I tried another (always liked Arctic, but couldn't get a fit for this one!).",
