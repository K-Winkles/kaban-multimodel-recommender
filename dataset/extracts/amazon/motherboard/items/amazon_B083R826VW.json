                "reviewText": "For the price, this is the BEST Mini-ITX AM5 motherboard. The build quality is exceptional. This thing is HEAVY because it comes with a 12-layer PCB with serious cooling as well as a metal back-plate and integrated IO shield. This board has surprising cooler compatibility, even if it comes close to not fitting some larger coolers. Everything is robust and reinforced, and the ports are solid and satisfying. I had minor issues with the included WiFi which seems to have sorted itself out. However, the WiFi signal quality and speed are among the best I've ever seen! The included antenna is not one to throw away. It's actually nice because it can fold to different positions, and attach with solid magnets. Another thing I really appreciate is that it can hold 3x NVME drives, which I find very impressive. One star off for the lack of an included user manual and the terrible instructions for a BIOS upgrade. A user manual is important because this board makes some really strange design choices to fit all of the expected connectivity on this board. For example, I had to remove the M.2 cooling shroud to get to the HD audio connector. I recommend using the Q-Flash Plus button on the back of the motherboard for BIOS upgrades because it makes it very easy. Just note there are very specific instructions that you have to follow, easily found online. I feel that $260 was a fair price considering how premium this motherboard is. It easily matches or surpasses the quality of some $500 motherboards.",

The front panel plug on the daughter board straight up doesn't fit the provided adapter, and eventually broke because of the sideways orientation2. Hasn't posted (CPU/GPU fans still run) even with updating the BIOS, keeping it on for 30+ minutes, and having the bare minimum plugged into the board. All parts are compatible according to their website and other completed builds.3. No status LED to diagnose errorsThere are also a bunch of weird design choices that don't make logical sense when you're building. It's unfortunate that there are so few options compared to previous generations, as each board seems to have multiple cons.Update: Bought the MSI B650i Edge and everything works now. Slightly fewer features (and a few flaws of its own), but the status LEDs helped with troubleshooting and the layout is much more intuitive.Keeping the 1* review here because of all the tradeoffs and design flaws.",

                "reviewText": "What can I say, after the messy Z690i Aorus Ultra Gigabyte lost me, but this was a straight banger. What else can I ask for? It as 3 NVMe slots, supports extremely high end kits and gets the job done of handling my 7950x3D with ease.I do with they didn\u2019t have a dongle for everything though. eg to connect fans, gigabyte has a dongle for that. If you want to use the ARGB headers they have another dongle for that, and the same for the front panel audio and USB 2 ports. It becomes a cluttered mess ruining cable management.Eventually I was able to get my build to look clean by making sacrifices on some of those ports.",

                "reviewText": "Seemed to work fine, until I plugged all my USB devices in. Even though it\u2019s has many USB ports, it couldn\u2019t provide power to 4 devices (Mouse, Keyboard, Wireless headphones, and microphone). Windows would say not enough resources for the USB devices then lock up. So I got a AC powered USB hub and plugged everything in there. This time no warnings just freeze.I never had any problems with Gigabyte, in fact it was my go to brand, but their design choices for this board was a pain. That flimsy riser card for SATA and other common mobo features is terrible. Returned instead of exchanged because of that.",

                "reviewText": "El motherboard funciona bien, y la verdad lo escog\u00ed por que era el que ten\u00eda mas features entre las tarjetas itx para am5, sin embargo para lograr esto muchos de los puertos como SATA y M.2 est\u00e1n montados en tarjetas secundarias, incluso algunos headers para abanicos y switches tambi\u00e9n. Fue todo un reto conectar todo ya que incluso cosas b\u00e1sicas como el switch de encendido va montado en un adaptador, que a su vez se conecta a una tarjeta secundaria.Especificamente para mi gabinete, el NZXT H1v2, fue necesario quitarle el disipador de calor al puerto M.2 PCIe 5 para que pudieran caber los tubos del enfriador AiO que viene incluido.En general funciona bien y fue facil habilitar los EXPO timings para mi memoria, tambien no he tenido problemas para que mi CPU mantenga sus relojes tope.En general lo recomiendo pero quiz\u00e1 para gabinetes no tan compactos ser\u00e1 una mejor opci\u00f3n.",
