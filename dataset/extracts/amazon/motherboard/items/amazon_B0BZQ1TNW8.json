                "reviewText": "I purchased this MB after a dismal experience with a unit from MSI.I should have noticed no optical out, but on checking that seems a thing with current GB products can't imagine why with a \"gamer\" MB. - easily solved with a cubilux USB to optical adapter.Board layout is perfect for use in a compact case. All USB and SATA ports are vertical. Only 4 ports, but both NVME slots can be used without loss of SATA ports and an add in card solved the requirement for extra ports.The absence of a manual seems common nowadays, but expecting this, I downloaded the manual ahead of time and read it - so no big issue. What was poor was that the BIOS was 2 versions out of date and the manual and online information missed an important fact - GB require that each update is added SEQUENTIALLY, until you discover that, its a no go. The BIOS error message just shows incorrect image - not very helpful. A simple message in the BIOS update would be nice, also there is no need to rename the BIOS as in the online product information and yes you need to format the memory stick to FAT or FAT 32.So basically a great little MB, not full of features but what is provided works well.",

THE MOTHER BOARD ITSELF IS HARD TO READ WITH THE FINE PRINT AND RED LETTERING. LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO FINELY SEE WHAT I NEEDED (THROUGH FLASHLIGHTS AND MULTIPLE PICTURES ZOOMED IN). I NEEDED TO CHECK THE BIOS FOR CONFIGURATIONS AND THERE WAS NO MANUAL! ONCE AGAIN, NOT THE END OF THE WORLD BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO HAVE AT LEAST SOMETHING IN THE BOX! MACHINE IS UP AND RUNNING AFTER A FEW HOURS OF DIGGING. FINALLY GOT THE MANUAL OFF OF GIGABYTES WEBPAGE.",

Ended up putting in a ryzen 5 5600x, 2070 super, 16gb 3600mhz ram and it works fine, easier being able to push 100+ fps on ultra settings in almost any game. Would recommend buying from this seller.",
