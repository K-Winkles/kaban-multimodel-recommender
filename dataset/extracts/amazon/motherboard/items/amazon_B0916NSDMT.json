                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing, period",
                "reviewText": "Expressing it quality in one short word of being \u201cAmazing\u201d isn\u2019t even enough to describe how good this Motherboard is. Please allow me sometimes to dissect it in details laterBut to sum it up, it is worth every penny at this price from Amazon, which is a sub $1200. Yet, it is Gen 11th, and it is expensive, but it runs like no others I have had the chance of owning. My 11900KF runs a cool 45C-54C under heavy load of maxed out COD MW2.0 , and constantly running at 4.9Ghz to 5.3Ghz on all core by simply enabling ASUS AI over clock, which is a one button solution and be done with itGiven the nature of it being water cooled, I paired it with ICUE HydroX from corsairs and D5000 case with additional fans.I can not complain about anything that this MB does. Of course, a lot of researches went into my decision to buy it, and I did not expect to see my 11th Gen to run breezily upto 5.3Ghz. To cut the technical details down a bit, the reasons why I bought this MB is because I do know how important a MB is, and the main reason why OC people can not max out their CPU potentials. It was all due to the VRM stages and cooling stages. Previously, Manufacturers were afraid to design high-end MB due to the $$ cost of productions and sales. Luckily, at the moment, they are doing it. What is better to cool your MB than using Water block for everything ? Especially being pure copper of 99.99% ? Cooling your VRM, CPU, chipset altogether ? And at this price, the Waterblock alone by itself is already worth the money. You may not believe me when I say \u201cproduction of the water block is very expensive\u201d. It is not easy to fabricate the block correctly with all the different dimensional cuts, lines, grooves, and importantly being a solid mono block of them all. To top that off, design it in a way that it is so DIY and you just can not mess it up. From the design, to the CNC milling for productions, it is very expensive.Even when you put that aside, there are other factors about the Mb that makes it worthy, first and foremost is the VRM stages, packing 20 phases total and with deadly precision is what enabled me to clock in from 4.9-5.3Ghz constantly. Then there are the utilizations of PCIE 3 to enable 3 slots for the M2 Drives, which allow one single dedicated PCIE 4x16 just to satisfy the desire of maxing out your beloved 4090.Next up is that simplistic OC at one button. This was done by ASUS geniuses. It set OC for both CPU and memory alike with AI constantly monitoring the parameters to enable the best there it to be achieved.If you also care about HiFi audio, the onboard ESS can drive HD800S to excellent level for gaming, movies, music all alike. Of course it won\u2019t be replacing your high end dedicated audiophile system anytime soon. However, it is a lot and a lot better than integrated Intel stuff.I didn\u2019t have the leisure to try and compare the Aorus MB , but so far, seeing my achievements, I say it is worth every Pennie\u2019s I paid for it and can not be any happier. Down right the best OC and PC I have ever built, especially that one button AI OC system. It amazes me. I like to OC stuff but I hate the headachesUpdates*: after running AI overclock for a week, seeing the varieties of different CPU voltages bothers me as the AI adjusts it on the fly. I have turned into manual OC. Using 4000Mhz RAM, and I am able to steadily, constantly OC all cores to 5.1Ghz with just 1.25V VCore. Now, I like things that are steady. For all that is said, the MB keeps on giving, and I keep on loving it",

                "reviewText": "It isn't lost on me, how crazy pricey this item is, and I feel lucky to have the ability to splurge on this item for my latest PC refresh. I cannot possibly put all of this thing to work, but just WOW @ how insane the feature set is, how great the build quality, and that I'm so excited to start obsessing over the cooling loop design.I have a solid month to focus and complete my parts gathering for the project, so I think I'll be almost done by the time my wife is ready to speak to me again.",

Other customers may not see the value in doing so, but for me it was completely worth it. After all couldn't be content with a $200 motherboard that does the same thing.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Asus Maximus XIII Extreme Glacial motherboard!!! This all-in-one water cooled board was the best money spent ever. I get top performance out of all of my memory, GPU, CPU. The integrated status window for temperature, frequency, fan speed or just a logo was a great ad. No need for raspberry pi. The EK water block keeps the CPU, VRM, PCH and the chipset are cool. The set up was almost plug and play. I added Samsung 970 Evo plus M.2 memory. Getting the motherboard to recognize the memory was not straightforward however that was the only glitch that I ran into during set up.If you have the budget it\u2019s a must have.",
