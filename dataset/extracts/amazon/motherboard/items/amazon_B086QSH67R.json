                "reviewText": "I'm a first time builder, but installation was a breeze with the help of the manual and Youtube. A little skimpy on details for proper fan header usage, but that could be more related to my noob builder status (despite probably falling well into the \"old man\" category for PC gamers) more than the documentation itself. Installing an i5-10600K, high-end Noctua air cooler, 4 memory sticks for 64GB total, and 1 m.2 drive all went off easily, as did the necessary power and I/O connections. Everything worked properly the first time.From a feature perspective, it has all I could possibly need and more. Wifi 6, 2.5gbe (though not very useful until someone starts building 2.5gb routers), Bluetooth 5.1, all easy to use and good reception. Occasionally I pick up the wifi from a nearby hotel that's gotta be at least a quarter of a mile away. I'll probably never use all the available USB ports, but it's got loads of them in every flavor that's relevant in 2020. (At least one good thing to say about 2020.) I'm strictly a headphone user, but it's got superb 7.1 audio available, too. I can't even think of something I would like to have that isn't there.Overclocking is a piece of cake, especially for newbies. I've got my proc running at 4.8GHz, and 3200MHz on the memory and it's completely stable. Could probably do even better if I really knew what I was doing, but I'm just relying on the AI overclocking for now.Conventional wisdom is that the LGA1200 socket is going to support at least up to 11th Gen when it comes out (and Intel's 7nm woes make that even more likely), so future drop in upgradeability is built in. Also a good chance (but no guarantees) that it will support PCIe 4.0 when it shows up on the processors, though I'm not sure how useful that will be until several generations down the line.If gaming is your primary concern, this MB paired with the 10600K is where it's at today. For a productivity heavy workload, AMD is probably still a better bet, but personally I'll only be using some light to moderate Photoshop work, and possibly future personal/youtube video editing so I have no need to push things to the productivity limit with the radical price increases involved in doing so. YMMV.Overall, a strong recommend from me on this product.(Disclosure: By posting this review I am eligible for a 90 day warranty extension, but as the base is 3 years that's not a big deal. The opinions herein are my own and were not influenced by this bonus, just happy timing as I was planning to post a review anyway.)",

                "reviewText": "I used this in a gaming PC I built for a co-worker. It's a really nice looking board, with all the must-have features. The RGB effects are especially nifty if you want to build something you can really show off. The manual is fairly helpful and comprehensive. The only problems I had during assembly were mostly due to me working with hardware I'd never used before. (This was the first system I'd built in a few years, and PC technology doesn't stand still.) ASUS boards have always been good performers, and their quality has done nothing but improve over the years.My only complaint with this board is the onboard Wi-Fi. It worked, but only just barely. I had to connect the external antenna to get a signal at all, and even then it was painfully slow. This is a fairly minor quibble, since anyone building a gaming desktop is far more likely to use a wired LAN, and the system worked great once I hooked up the ethernet cable.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this MB for my new desktop with Core i9-10900K (10th gen 10 core CPU) and NZXT H710i. It's been a while since I built a new rig, so I wasn't sure what to choose but I always like ASUS, and a knowledgeable friend of mine recently got a new ASUS MB and likes it so I followed him. The reasons I picked this MB among many Z-490 MB are (1) there is built in wifi / BT (2) there are two display outputs (HDMI and Display port). I think this is the only ASUS MB that satisfies both. There aren't many MBs with two display outputs because most people who use Z-490 paired with the latest gen Intel CPU use external GPU or two so they don't need to use the Graphics that comes with the CPU and the display outputs using the graphics chip on CPU. But I use the PC for large-scale numerical simulations so I need a fast CPU but I don't need any graphics power. But I want to use two monitors, which is why I wanted to have two display outputs. So far everything is working great, including wifi. I read that the Ethernet connection on this MB might not work well, but I only use wifi so I cannot verify this claim. I might report it when I try wired network connection. The MB fits perfectly to NZXT H710i mid tower case. I even give ASUS Aura sync a try, and attached three LCD strips. They make the PC look great at night. I also use two Samsung SSD and AIO cooler (Kraken X73) on MB and they work perfectly. Using the BIOS it's easy to OC this monster. I don't use the software, which is so buggy and confusing, so I am inclined to drop one star, but since I uninstall the buggy ASUS software, I decided not to drop a star. So far I am very happy with the hardware (not so much with software).",

Something wasn't right, I built this computer and it's only 2 years old at the time of this review. After purchasing a NIC card, I'm getting close to 900 down. I can confirm, that this motherboard's ethernet port is terrible. Do yourself a favour and buy a NIC card, I bought mine from Amazon for $15 and it was a huge improvement.",

A few things to be careful of, if you plan on air cooling the CPU the ram slots are pretty close and may limit access. Also when updating the bios be careful when flash updating to the latest version as this caused mine to be unable to boot into windows form the bios. After changing and playing around with the booting options I got it working but it was time consuming. Other than that it is a beautiful board with great functionality.",
