                "reviewText": "I have owned a few different brand PSU's over the last 20 or so years and always tended to go with Seasonic for there longevity. My last one went strong for about 8 years before starting to lose 5v stability recently. So I figured I would just go Seasonic again but decided to do a little shopping around first. I had always heard good things about be quiet CPU heatsinks and fans being very reliable and super quiet but had never owned anything from them. So after watching some reviews and reading a bunch about them I decided to give one a go. I have a Praxis Wetbench (PC test bench) that has nothing to block any fan noise which is always a challenge when dealing with a test bench config. I have my system filly liquid cooled and some very quiet fans on my radiator but my Seasonic PSU was always the loudest part of my setup. To the point where when at full load benchmarking or gaming it would sound like a hair dryer and was always a bit annoying. Over the years I guess I just got used to it and debt with it. But with this be queit let me tell you.. THIS THING IS NEAR SILENT! Even when pushing it pretty hard it never gets louder them my radiator fans and they are very quiet. I cannot put into words how peaceful my office is now. Its wonderful! I cannot speak to be quiet's longevity but I can definitely say its by far, the quietest PSU I have ever used and the build quality seems very good. Also come with very pliable sleeved cables. Much better then the flat black one you get with Corsair, Thermaltake, Coolermaster and multitude of other brands. Hoping for many years of use. Love it so far!",

However, the inrush current into this beast at power-up is so high that it brings the line voltage down far enough to momentarily trip my Cyber Power UPS...but only if the line voltage is 118v or below.

As well, I've got a huge tower case with the power supply mounted at the bottom and the motherboard 24-pin and two 8-pin cpu connectors are at the top edge of the vertically mounted board...and yet the cables that come with this supply are long enough...sweet!",

                "reviewText": "I didn't write a review when I first purchased this power supply nor when this power supply failed but I decided it was time to do so now. I purchased this power supply around Sep 2021 as part of several other items needed to rebuild my desktop. It installed fairly easily and it did come with plenty of connector cables.While it was in use the loudest parts of my computer were the cooling fans (still are). When it failed almost 11 months later. Unfortunately, I couldn't wait for the whole return/test/fail/replace scenario to play out and purchased another beQuiet power supply a day later (I had to get the 11 Platinum 1200w since it was the only one available for next day delivery).I finally got around to mailing off the broken supply in April 2023. I was notified April 21 that the facility had received my item. It is now May 2nd, 2023 and my replacement power supply was delivered today. I am pleased with the fairly quick turn around .. I just wish it was more like a broken cell phone .. they ship you the replacement FIRST and if you fail to send the broken item back they charge you for it.If I can find someone who wants to buy a new Straight Power 11 Platinum 1000W power supply I can offset some of my costs, since I don't expect the one in my computer to die (in over 20 years of building my computers I have only had 2 power supplies fail on me .. I have replaced many for bigger/better/newer reasons).",

El nivel de ruido es muy silenciosa, aunque no tiene la tecnolog\u00eda de zero fan mode, pareciera que lo tiene integrado el ventilador no se oye en lo absoluto. Respecto al 850w probablemente fue un poco de overkill ya que planeo meterle una 3080 y un ryzen 7 o 9 aun esperando la zen 3. pero tener un poco extra no hace da\u00f1o y te deja espacio para futuras upgrades.Recomendada si quieres una alternativa a una corsair rmx (caracterizada por silenciosa) y con certificaci\u00f3n platino.",
