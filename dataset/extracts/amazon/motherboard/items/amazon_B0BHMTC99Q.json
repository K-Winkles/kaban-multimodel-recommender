                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Impressive features that match many X670E motherboards.",
                "reviewText": "Received on January 27, 2023. Will update this review as needed.-----Update as of May 26, 2023.-Asus has done some damage control and have clarified that for they will cover the warranty for B650 and X670 motherboards even if you use EXPO or a beta bios - new bios versions are also available. However, I am not changing my review rating as the situation was still handled very poorly and my rating reflects that as it involves this product/motherboard.-----Update as of May 5, 2023.-TLDR for this update:Don't buy an Asus motherboard for Zen 4 (7000 series CPUs). Look elsewhere at brands like MSI, Gigabyte or ASRock.If you already own an Asus board, update your bios and check your voltage. Limit it manually if possible.-Unfortunately, despite the features and good price point for its features (compared to the market), I can't exactly recommend this motherboard or any Asus motherboard for AM5 Zen4 CPUs.Please refer to Gamers Nexus for more technical information regarding the issues affecting Asus motherboards and more details about Asus' poor handling of the situation.In short, Asus had a faulty bios that caused issues to Zen4 CPUs by feeding them more voltage than needed when EXPO profiles were enabled. This is a much bigger issue for X3D CPUs but it doesn't mean non X3D are unaffected. This sort of thing will impact the lifespan of your CPU as running at the unnecessarily high voltages is very demanding and causes physical degradation of the silicon.In my case, I undervolted my CPU but I would imagine most users did not. Asus' then delivered beta versions of their bios that promised to fix this issue at the cost of waiving your warranty for using a beta version. (and it didn't even fix the issue) This is very disappointing and I can no longer trust Asus after seeing how they handled this. Their recommendation to disable EXPO is shortsighted and senseless as doing this will negatively impact your CPUs performance in a big way as well as possibly cause instability on some RAM sticks. Asus is no longer the quality premium brand it pretended to be.Even if your CPU is not dead yet, any damage done to your CPU for running at such high voltage is already there and it is permanent.-----I am currently using this with my Ryzen R9 7900X and have not experienced any issues. It boosts properly and its performance is stable with CL30 memory clocked at 6000Mhz.It offers Gen5 PCIe and Gen5 m.2 so you can future proof your system if you ever intend to upgrade to a new GPU (current 40 and 7000 series GPUs are only Gen4 so don't worry about it for now). Likewise with the m.2 slots, it supports Gen5 so you can also upgrade your storage when needed.It is an 8 layer board with excellent power delivery so it's got your basic overclocking needs covered as well.Either this or the B650E AORUS MASTER which offers very similar features/specs at the same price point are great options, I highly recommend checking out the full specs of both and see which one offers what you want.Also remember this, motherboards will not really make much of a difference for gaming so you can avoid overspending on this to increase your budget elsewhere. Buy them based on the features you want and if you are an avid overclocker who wants the absolute best, you should probably look at the X670E boards instead.This board also has Clear and Reset CMOS options, which is an excellent feature if you ever mess up anything in the bios. You can always use that to go back to the base stable settings or install a fresh bios. It also has a Q-Code display for basic troubleshooting if your system is ever not booting properly.Keep in mind that you can only use 3x m.2 drives if you want PCIe Gen5 on the first PCIe slot. Using other PCIe slots may also lower the bandwidth to Gen4 on the first one depending on the amount of lanes used.Overall, with this board you are gonna get similar features to that of the mid-high X670E boards at a much lower price and not have any sort of performance issues, while at the same time, futureproofing your system so you can drop in a new gen5 GPU or gen5 m.2 storage in a few years.",

                "reviewText": "Once you get this working, it works well. But getting it working can be a huge headache. By default this motherboard will not recognize legacy boot drives (this can be enabled in BIOS), none of the drivers required are easily available, and until they are properly installed this motherboard is very unstable (as in, expect BSOD every few minutes).If you are planning to use this for a Windows PC, then there are two options to easily get it working, but before you start I strongly recommend downloading the chipset, ethernet, and WIFI drivers from the ASUS website and keeping this somewhere safe. But those two methods:1: Use a HDD with an existing and fully updated version of windows (you may need to set CSM to enable legacy boot media in BIOS).2: Before you start, download a new version of Windows 11 and make a boot USB. When loading windows YOU MUST have a mobile device capable of USB tethering so you can use the internet (the onboard WIFI and LAN are disabled until you manually install the drivers from the ASUS website).*Hint: You Must run windows update before you can install the LAN/WIFI drivers which you need to run windows update.I spent two days fighting with this motherboard trying to solve instability, get past various POST errors, and get basic drivers loaded. Now that it's done I'm happy with the board. This is not an expensive motherboard, but getting here was not worth the savings.",

Must warn anyone that intends on buying AM5 motherboards, make sure to flash your BIOS to the latest version prior to doing any setup of OS and further use for stability reasons.The Q-Code appears to be more useful on Asus boards due to the number of potential issues you can encounter.I was able to get the motherboard posting immediately after installing all parts, but ran into a few minor issues, mainly ram seating issues. After ram was fully secured in, there wasn't any present issues. The latest BIOS made it more stable than previous comments throughout the internet, but there's still work to do for the BIOS.By default, Disabling Memory Context Restore and Enabling Fast Boot will make your post to loading OS roughly over 40 seconds every time you turn on the computer. Owners of this board will need to make their own adjustments to fasten post to load time.",
