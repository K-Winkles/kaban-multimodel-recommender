I needed a small motherboard for a project, and the 4105 was a better buy than the only other one I could find. Fast Forward to now, I was looking for a cheap ITX board for a test build, just to see how it would work out, and this is about as cheap as you're going to get anywhere. This is half the price I paid for the 4105, and it's a step up from it.Sort of. I ran the bunches of benchmarks, and the 4105 and the 4125 traded wins fairly evenly. But $70 is hard to pass up. $24 for the memory, an SSD I had bought for cheap a couple of weeks ago, and a GT1050 just lying around, and it's not too bad.What's not so good is the strange noise coming from the motherboard when it's running graphically intensive programs. Not when the CPU is busy, just when it's dumping stiff across the PCIe bus. I'm hoping that if it decides to die, it does it before the end of January...",

                "reviewText": "When my mother board in one of my older systems failed (which I'm sure had nothing to do with the fact that I was constantly changing parts in it and damaged a PCIe slot), I decided to look for a low power board to replace it since I had relegated it to just being used for internet stuff and being a file server for my other systems. I was not disappointed in this board. It was able to boot from a clone of my previous boot drive, which I hadn't been able to get any other board to to, so all I had to do was purchase a new windows license since my old one was OEM, update to Win 11, which my old system couldn't do. It only draws about 10 watts when idle, so I just leave it on all the time. It does not have built in WiFi or USB-C, I may add USB-C using the PCIe slot (I have to get a different case to do that) and USB Wifi.",
