I have an AMD7900X connected to this motherboard as well as an AMD RX 6800 XT video card and the ease of running all games is notable. There is no hardware complaint I can come up with. The software from ASUS on the other hand is extremely annoying. You cannot run armoury crate unless you are logged on as an administrator which means you cannot make any RGB settings changes nor see what updates are available in the software. Armoury crate also installs every time you log onto a standard Windows user account and then log into the Windows Admin account. The Armoury crate software is what automatically installs with this motherboard and the only word I have for the software is TERRIBLE. If you can deal with the annoyance of the software that makes this motherboard run RGB, the hardware is exceptional and installation instructions are fantastic.",

Tried another power supply, same issue. Only thing I have not tried is the CPU but from the looks of it, it looks like an issue with the power being delivered to the board because as soon as I plug in the power supply, it just turns on and presents the DRAM LED. Fans are also not turning on. This is only after 4 months and what is sad is I had bought this off Amazon and shipped it internationally and since it is out of the return window, I had to deal with ASUS. Was expecting for Asus to send me a prepaid label but I was wrong.EDIT: I could not send it back as Warranty only applies to US and Canada. Sad life.",

What helped me make up my mind was the pcie-5 compatibility for future Gpu upgrades. I have 0 coil whine and temps are within normal limits. I using an 78003dx and a rx6800xt and have 0 issues.

A low level of competition is clearly being taken advantage of by all market participants resulting an expensive board(s). For those willing to bite the financial bullet this makes for an excellent board for a SFF build if the MSI board (better value) doesn't work for you.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Decent MB, but poor compatibility",
                "reviewText": "The vast majority of PC users don't need anything more fancy than this. Indeed, they don't even need something as fancy as this. PCIe 5 is overkill and only the most extreme of GPU or parallel storage use cases will come even close to saturating those pipes. But, it does make this MB a candidate for future-proofing since AM5 is going to be supported by AMD for a while, PCIe 5 will unlock more usecases that software and hardware will take advantage of, and DDR5 will eventually come down in price. It's certainly why I got it. I don't want to upgrade my MB for the next 5 years or so and I think this is a good board to do that with.The MB has a USB-C DisplayPort slot which is useful since most new monitors support it and it's a lot easier to use than standard DP which you would presumably plug into your GPU.The built-in sound card is good enough. I don't have any objective way to measure it but I used to be a musician and the music I'm playing on my backup set of speakers sounds fine. The fact that my desk is too small for my massive monitors is the most glaring source of sound quality issues.There's a lot of drama around AMD's AM5 chipset, fried CPUs, and an all-around mess. This board is no exception, but I haven't had any big issues so far. There is a BIOS update (non-beta) to limit Vsoc to 1.3V, but that isn't a complete fix for all issues identified so you should leave all settings default and auto and turn off the computer when you're done with it.DDR5 compatibility is quite low. Anecdotally, there are many who can't get sticks on the QVL to work correctly, but I think the main issue is that they don't work with EXPO or non-default settings. At regular speeds I got my sticks (Kingston 64GB 4800, KF548C38BBK2-64) to work. Maybe you will as well. It's very apparent that ASUS had a hard time getting many of their AM5 boards to work with DDR5 sticks.Product physical build quality seems high. It has a stiff heft to it that makes you think it's quite solid. Of course, I don't know how strong it actually is since I didn't want to break it. The reinforced PCIe slot is welcome since I have bad memories in a previous build with a heavy GPU causing problems.The front M.2 slot has some included heatsink and thermal pads which is useful if you have a really high speed SSD you need to cool down. I don't think it's necessary for PCIe 3 SSDs, but it's probably needed for PCIe 4 and 5 ones if you have high utilization (no idea how a casual person would achieve this, but it might happen).The back M.2 slot is just a slot with a Q-latch which is just a captive screw with an extra semi-circle of material to latch the M.2 stick in. Nothing fancy, doesn't need to be.One issue I had with installation was that my GPU's backplate made it impossible to use all of the front panel wires since there was not enough space to accommodate the plugs. I still had enough to handle the Power LED and Power Button, but left the others unused for convenience.",
