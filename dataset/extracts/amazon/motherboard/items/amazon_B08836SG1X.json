                "reviewText": "This is the 2nd discrete TPM I've purchased and unlike the 1st one I bought locally in South Africa, this one works perfectly on my Asus ROG Strix X570 motherboard. It's extremely unfortunate that discrete TPM devices have different pin outs instead of being standardized as that only leads to confusion to the end user. Hopefully in the future every manufacturer sticks to the same connector pin out in the future.Nonetheless, I installed this onto my motherboard extremely easily, went into the UEFI settings and changed my TPM from the AMD Firmware option to Discrete instead and then rebooted. Everything worked just as expected and the TPM is immediately picked up in Windows 11 without any issue.The TPM was packaged well enough for such a tiny device and despite travelling halfway around the planet, arrived with no damage and perfectly intact.Overall, I wish manufacturers just included these in the box by default, but that aside this worked perfectly, so 5 stars from me.",

                "reviewText": "The piece is very small, and the manual for the ASUS motherboard (X570 STRIX in my case) shows a diagram where it needs to be plugged in to some pin headers, just adjacent to the CPU and graphics card slot.The only issue is that the spot is going to be below the graphics card (in my case a 2080ti).So needing to pull the graphics card out, and then finding a way to press this small board down on a header that is somewhat underneath the CPU cooler.... you can't get your hand/fingers in there.My solution seemed to work well - get some poster tack / blue tack, and a pencil with a squared off eraser (or a dowel or a pen with a flat end). Apply the tack to the squared of end of the pencil, then stick the top side to that tack. This puts the tiny board on the end of a stick held on by the tack. Now you can carefully maneuver it down and over the pin header under the CPU cooler. Press it down carefully (be sure to align the keyed pin correctly), and it slides on easily enough. Twist the pencil and the blue tack off and bobs your uncle.Reinstall graphic card, put the rest of the tower back together, boot up and enter the BIOS/UEFI and go to the security/advanced section to make sure the TPM is enabled and selected (and not the CPU based software TPM). Booting into Windows and checking by running TMP.msc to verify its up and found.. and it was. Good to go.Now the only thing standing between going to Windows 11 is deciding if I want to enable UEFI in place of BIOS, with the recovery boot nightmare that can cause... so for now I'm staying BIOS and Windows 10.",

Replaced the mother board and decided to add a TPM module for encryption security etc. By luck I decided to research TPMs and found they are not all made equal. So went to manufacturer website found right one then checked on Amazon and found this item. Bought it and arrived on time. I installed it in less than 10minutes. Quality is good. I'm now encrypted and secured. If you gonna buy a tpm module check manufacturer website recommendation for your motherboard first. Don't forget to enable tpm in the bios and if your on windows tpm.msc bitlocker. etc",

                "reviewText": "I had purchased 2 of these in Nov 2021 for me and my wife - Prime Z390-A motherboards. ASUS Rep said it would work... Can't trust them. Most of them SEEM to have a proper picture; so you have to either look at your MB's pin configuration and compare it to the images and type of TPM!!! This motherboard has a empty pin at pin 10. Therefore the one I need should have a 'block' at Pin 10. This one has a block at Pin 1 or pin 2, not sure. So this one will not fit a Prime Z390-A MB.",
