                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Huge improvement for my build!",
                "reviewText": "For the longest time, I've been using an Asus P8H61-I R2.0, paired with an Intel i5-3470 and 16Gb of Kingston DDR3-10600. I started with some HDDs and a very crappy Geforce GTS450. Eventually, I upgraded to SSDs and an a GTX-1060. While it still performed everything I asked of it quite nicely, the new generation of hardware was too much of a temptation and decided to upgrade. The main reason I chose this board was the built-in Thunderbolt connectivity and the form factor. The RGB is a nice bonus too...After setting everything up, I haven't experienced any issues. Installing my Ryzen 7 3700x was a breeze. Space to \"maneuver\" is scarce, but that's a given with any mITX board. I went with a Noctua NH-L9i chromax.Black, which is one of the recommended coolers for this board and it fits in quite nicely. Make sure to install the CPU and cooler first! I was able to load the correct XMP profiles for the pair of HyperX Predator DDR4 3200MHz, plug my old SATA SSDs (which now work considerably faster, given that they are now plugged to SATA 3 ports rather than SATA 2 ports) and my GTX-1060. Even Windows 10 loaded without too much hassle, just a few bangs in device manager due lack of drivers and it complaining about \"activation\". Installed updated drivers, the latest BIOS, fixed Windows' activation nag and have been a happy camper since.Of course, nothing is perfect, I do have a complaint about the included manual. The one I got didn't have a board layout schematic, so it was difficult to ID the headers. To top it off, the case header is next to a USB 2.0 header which is almost identical. The board is all black and there's no text on itself to ID the headers. I downloaded one of the manuals from Asrock's website which did have the board layout schematic. Armed with that, I was reminded how much I hate plugging individual pins to a header. That's not a fault of the board, but a fault of the case. I wish Silverstone would have fitted the RVZ-02 with one of those \"unified\" case plugs...I read a few reviews of users complaining about the angled SATA ports, which I thought could give me a bit of trouble, but it really hasn't. I think that would depend on the case and cables, I guess.I still need to get a Thunderbolt dock, an NVMe drive, a better monitor, a different case and some water cooling to finish how I want to set everything up, but as it is right now, it's working fantastically. Everything is super snappy and I haven't even played with the overclocking yet. This board was certified by Intel for it's Thunderbolt, I doubt it'll be an issue. I've used Asrock boards in the past and have been very happy with their reliability and their longevity. I expect this to continue with this one.",

User the Intel 1151 heatsink and fan which fits a 2u rack case easily. Cut off the harness hook on the stock intel 1151 heatsink to get the memory in the slot closest to the heatsink. Get an M.2 extender cable so the M.2 drive isn't stuck under the board This allows an M.2 heatsink addition. Past that it should be all good. Be sure to check the CPU compatibility. I have used a Ryzen 3700X on this one. the former had a 2700X which is a bit hard to get at a good price these days. Carefully identify the pin orientation when dropping the CPU in the slot. Be sure to remove the plastic from the Chipset heatsinks too or it will run hot. Never overclocking in a DAW if you ask me. Case fans should also have a nice front to rear flow. Runs pretty cool if you follow these guidelines",

                "reviewText": "I've used other ASRock B450/X370/470 boards with great success, but this ain't it chief. My hope was to get Thunderbolt 3 on AMD.Let's start with the fact that you'll need an Intel cooler (LGA 1511) for this board. Yes, you heard right, for an AMD board you need to get a cooler that you'll likely never use outside this build and don't have on-hand. Why? Must have something to do with the chipset layout and Intel-related things, but a nasty surprise nonetheless.Then you get into the abysmally large IO cover/heatsink. ITX is for small form factor, what is this? I need space, not for the board to take up more of it with junk like this.The X570 boards now use the chipset fan for PCIe 4.0, which isn't exclusive to this board but I wasn't impressed with the fan noise. I was using the Noctua L9i (again Intel.. what) and could still hear the chipset fan over the CPU cooler. That shouldn't be a thing.I never did have good luck with Thunderbolt, this board was a complete disappointment that resulted in me tearing apart my Velka 3 SFF build for a few hours only to give up and return. Back the ASRock X470 Fatality board, much better bet. (And yes, I updated the BIOS).Could I have gotten this board to work? Sure. But why? It would have been 10x the headache, with a Frankenstein cooler, for what gain? *Maybe* Thunderbolt? No thanks.",

                "reviewText": "Excelente tarjeta madre. Muy bonita est\u00e9ticamente. La raz\u00f3n por la que no le doy 5 estrellas es porque viene con un bios desactualizado, hace algo de ruido el ventilador pero una vez actualizado se soluciona el problema. Por otro lado tuve que instalar unas 5 veces el sistema operativo y estar moviendo algunos settings en el bios para que arrancara. B\u00e1sicamente instalaba Windows, y al momento de apagarla, ya no volteaba. No se cual sea el problema pero despu\u00e9s de varias instalaciones del Windows se arregl\u00f3 el problema y despu\u00e9s de un par de meses de uso ya no ha dado problemas. La otra cosa que no me esperaba es que el soviet del micro controlador es para AMD pero no acepta el disipador para AMD, sino que trae las 4 perforaciones para ventilador de Intel. Es raro pero as\u00ed viene. En mi caso instale un ryzen 5 y como disipador de calos un Corsair H60 con los accesorios para socket intel. Fuera de esos inconvenientes me parece una muy buena tarjeta. Arranca muy r\u00e1pido trae muy buena tarjeta de sonido, de 32 bits, buena cantidad de puertos usb y debo decir que est\u00e9ticamente se ve muy bien.",
