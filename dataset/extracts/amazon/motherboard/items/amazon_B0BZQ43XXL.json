                "reviewText": "Some motherboards have heatsinks too high or have the CPU socket too close to the rear. This one fits just right, as long as you're not using glass panels, a bit too snug of a fit but it works!Also there's a review here saying that it's too hard to install the m2 nvme SSD. It's just that the instructions could've been better done. You need to unscrew quite a bit, remove some stickers, but the most frustrating part is removing the heatsink plug (I forgot the acronym they give it). To remove the plug, you must first take the audio cable blocking it out, and that's not indicated in the instructions. Yes. The wire above it that looks like it's plugged in or something but it is actually the plug for the HD audio header. Take that out then you can take out the SSD plug by lifting it upwards (provided you've unscrewed all the parts of the plug that you need to already).Anyway, technical difficulties aside, it's a great board. Works good. Boots fast. The included wifi antenna is awesome, as it's magnetic so you can point it towards the optimal direction your router is, and I wish it was industry standard. I was on a computer going 400mbps before upgrading here and getting 800mbps (430 before I pointed it at my router). Big upgrade!Oh right, q-flash was super easy and I was able to update it quickly for compatibility with my 14th Gen Intel processor, without changing processors, as I had a USB microsd with the new bios downloaded on it. Just had to enable dynamic tuning and install the driver and was good to go. Windows didn't recognize the integrated wlan until after I installed the drivers.Enjoying my new build! If there's one gripe I can remember, it's that the rgb control options aren't great (can't get my RAM rgbs to shutoff during sleep) but I can live with having my rgbs on at all times I guess.",

                "reviewText": "Most of the information needed to install is in the User Manual at Gigabyte.com, removing the board that the SSD (Samsung 990 PRO) plug into hung me up until I discovered the front panel audio connector stopping the BTB board from being able to be removed. In the rear of the manual it shows the cable, plug folded up and how to re-route it. Section 10 explains the M2A_CPU / M2P_SB, basically the very bottom socket is direct to the CPU PCIe buss, the M2P_SB or top socket is hooked directly to the support chip. My build is based on my first build 4 years ago (i5-9400) in the same ITX case, small it better with liquid cooling and minimum wattage/heat, this after building a dual core, dual video controller monster computer that could heat the house... My new build has an Intel i9-13900K, 64GB DDR5 5600MT memory, two Samsung 990 2TB NVMe M.2 devices, 1,000 watt modular power supply, 4 USB 3.2 GEN 2 connectors in the front off the internal USB32_C connector + 2 USB 3.0 GEN 1 on the front panel.The bios has many setting, the fan control is amazing as is the lighting settings. There is desktop apps that can setup everything so DO NOT download anything from Gigabyte.com but the mb_driver_660_killerwifi_(version).zip, the first time you boot into Windows it downloads the GCC which will install everything but first you have to get access to the internet. When you install Windows 11 the first time it boots it will try to setup your network, you'll need mb_driver_660_killerwifi_(version).zip un-zipped to mb_driver_660_killerwifi_(version).exe on a USB thumb drive and Ctrl+F10 to a command prompt to run mb_driver_660_killerwifi_(version).exe and install the Killer AX WiFi drivers, windows will then find your hotspot and allow you to continue setting up the computer. So far nothing in the new computer feels hot except the heat shields on the memory, the one closest to the CPU run at 87\u00b0F the other one at 86\u00b0F and I can't hear any fan except during power on for a second or two. I will be installing a 14TB 3.5\" HDD for video files, when it arrives.",

No bid, no invoice, hmmm.and it's not my fault.Circuit boards are not meant to withstand horizontal sideways forces. 10 seconds after installing the BTB plug, it failed with a loud snap, obviously under significant horizontal force. The peon tech says I didn't get the board in the slot and thus broke it, even though that is not possible (plug connectors off at least 3/16 inch when BTB plug not in slot). Peon Tech def: someone who #1's on you, then #2's about it.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Finesse is required for positioning the FP audio header",
                "reviewText": "The front panel (FP) audio header on this motherboard is mounted on a cable that arrives packed into a gap under a heatsink. No instructions are provided for freeing that cable. Instead, the instructions jump right into removing the M.2 mounting daughterboard, which is impossible until the FP audio header cable is freed from under the heatsink and moved out of the way.I managed to carefully free the FP audio header cable using a pair of small needle nose pliers, although those did mark up the jacket of the cable a bit. The instructions suggest routing the FP audio header cable to be positioned adjacent to the PCIe slot.However, that prevented my Sparkle A770 Titan GPU from fully seating in the PCIe slot. Instead, I had to route the FP audio header cable to protrude up from under the heatsink covering the base of the cable. With the AIO cooler that I used, that positioning works fine. However, it may interfere with an air cooler.",
