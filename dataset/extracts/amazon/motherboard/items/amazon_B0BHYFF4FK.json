The board works hassle free, and works well with rgb devices. There are a couple things that really sticks out as positives. The first is the button release for graphics card. It worked wonderfully when I had to replace my GPU. The second is the vast array of NVMe slots. It was amazing to have of the options. If you know your storage runs a bit hot, you can locate them in a cooler place.I would recommend this board to any seasoned computer person, who loves having the freedom to try a little tweaking of the configuration.",

                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying I will probably never buy another ASUS mobo ever again. The pain, frustration and countless hours wasted trying installing and uninstalling these detective mobos has left a surely bad impression.2 out of 3 of the mobos I ordered were defective. 1st I ordered the ASUS ROG Strix Z760-A D4. Upon installation and boot up I got CPU Fan header error (common for ASUS now, google it) even though my AOI was correctly hooked up and CPU header. Had to go into BIOS and ignore the error. Trying to use it for a short period of time it kept crashing windows 10. Completely unstable. So, had to tear down pc again and remove. In the meantime I ordered another onr but decided to upgrade to the same board but the DDR5 version. That board was fine and worked properly, however I then realized I could not overclock it, but it did not have that feature. Misleading marketing made me think I could.So, I decided to return this one and upgrade to the ROG Strix Z790-A DDR5. Again had to remove all components and start over. 2 days later I get the new Z790 installed and boot up. Guess what? The same issues as the 1st faulty one.CPY fan header errors. Wouldn\u2019t post, had to flash BIOS multiple times because it would freeze a ROG logo screen. Complete frustration at this point. I\u2019ve removed the board again and have return in process. But that\u2019s not the end of the story. So I went ahead and purchased the MSI Z790 Edge from my local Best Buy and have that installed now and running like a dream. So now I\u2019m unable to uninstall all of the ASUS bundleware crap (AI suite, Amory Crate, Sonic Suite companion, etc.) All this crapware is extremely hard to remove from windows. Many others are facing theses same issues. If you google \u201cremove AI suite\u201d or \u201cremove Sonic Suite Companion\u201d you\u2019ll see what I mean. Total bundle crapware. I will never buy another ASUS mobo again! Total QC failure and the crapware is almost as bad as malware! Shame on ASUS!",

Install was fairly painless outside of invasive nature of motherboard removal/replacement. Most of the connectors on the new board were in the same place as the old one, making things easier. Only the USB 3.1 connection had moved significantly (from bottom to right side), necessitating cable movement in case. The black/white theme looks great, and the push-button GPU card removal function is very welcome! I also like the fact that the board has built-in WiFi and Bluetooth.",

                "reviewText": "Todo con el producto es una pasada, realmente al momento de abrirla ves el monstruo de MOTHERBOARD que es.. puedo decir sin haberla usado que es una pasada de componente. Le doy 5 estrellas en las caracteristicas, pero el peque\u00f1o y gran detalle por el que le doy 3 estrellas en general, es por que en la descripci\u00f3n en el apartado de \"TIPO DE MEMORIA RAM\" dice que es DDR5... y realmente es DDR4. M\u00e1s abajo dice que es ddr4 pero no hab\u00eda llegado hasta ese punto, realmente nunca llegamos hasta el final de las descripci\u00f3nes ya que lo importante esta arriba en ciertas partes. Por eso en el momento en que veo que dice DDR5 , me basto para comprarla. Solamente como comentario positivo, el vendedor de de poner bien en la descripci\u00f3n lo que es realmente, no se si fue error de el vendedor o realmente as\u00ed lo puso pero bueno. Ya envi\u00e9 de regreso el paquete y espero no tener problemas con el reembolso.De ah\u00ed en m\u00e1s si piensas renovar motherboard y tus componentes son todav\u00eda DDR4, sin duda este ser\u00eda una buena opci\u00f3n de compra ;)Saludos desde Aguascalientes :D",
