                "reviewText": "Like many people, I was searching for a decent motherboard compatible with Ryzen 3000. Well, this is it. The B450 Steel Legend (as well as the Micro ATX version, B450M) should come updated out of the box if you purchase new from Amazon Services.If you are hesitant to purchase this board, don't worry. So far, it has worked perfectly with my Ryzen 7 3800X and EVGA 2070 XC Ultra. Despite the subpar VRM and only using the Wraith Prism, my CPU temperatures only fluctuate between 50-60s during gaming with only two case fans from my NZXT H510. And everything has been perfectly cool during my gaming sessions. I don't even think I've gone over 75 degrees yet.Overall, the B450 Steel Legend is a good, affordable motherboard to get your Ryzen 3000 working out of the box. And having a PCI-E STEEL SLOT and single RAM retention clip/lock is a nice touch when using a big graphics card. Furthermore, I have not had any problems with the ASRock RGB software and the BIOS layout is very simple and direct.The B450 has been extremely easy to work with and build on. However, if you are expecting more premium features from this board, you should look elsewhere. For the price though, it is a great deal!Note: If you\u2019re planning to use the Wraith Prism, I recommend adjusting the fan curves or purchasing another cooler if you want a silent experience out of the box. It does the job but with a little too much noise for my taste.",

Fortunately, mine came with this 3rd gen ready sticker on box. Unfortunately, all of my pc parts haven't come in yet, so I'll have to wait a bit longer to see if all works well. Its a beautiful motherboard at a fairly decent price point. You can't get a better deal on a b450 mobo unless you buy a mATX board.Edit: PC is working fine, this mother board is running a ryzen 5 3600 with no problems at all. ran HWmonitor and GPUz to look at temps, no problems there. About what I would expect from the dinky stock cooler that comes with the cpu. No bios update was necessary. Also for those complaining about the passive rgb, switch your pc off at the back after powering it down if it annoys you so much. personally, I find it cool to look at.",

                "reviewText": "A great looking Motherboard that pairs well with both 3000 and 5000 series AMD CPUs, you'll have to update bios to run 5000 series, it works just as it should however, I will say that for the price you can find better b550 options that will have just as many features and newer pcie gen 4 so that's something to keep in mind. Another thing to consider is it's not a Wi-Fi board so for an extra $15-20 you can find some b450 and b550 with Wi-Fi capabilities.",

                "reviewText": "I used this motherboard for my son's Christmas build and it paired flawlessly with a Ryzen 5 2600x. Booted right up and had no problems with Windows installation or drivers. For a 'stormtrooper' type build it has a cool color scheme with the urban winter camo. It also includes an NVMe aluminum heatsink with thermal pad, which was appreciated. It's not the cheapest board out there at normal prices, but I still think it's worth it, and even moreso if you can get it on a good sale.I haven't done any overclocking as of yet, since it's really only used for casual gaming, but all the features are there for when my son wants to push the performance. The BIOS is easy to navigate and understand even if you only get the basics of overclocking. Solid product from ASUS!",

El sonido est\u00e1 muy bien, yo la uso con equipo 5.1 y va perfecto, trae tambi\u00e9n salida de audio \u00f3ptico por si ocupas. Definitivamente una tarjeta a considerar.",
