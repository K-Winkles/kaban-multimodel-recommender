Updating the bios was fairly easy to do, and explained well on the support site. It worked right out of the box with my Ryzen 5700G.The only, minor, criticism is that the lighting sync software is a Windows application, so on boot up, my RAM chips do not sync until the application is started. This is really only noticeable when my son boots into his account before I load into mine. It might be a bit better were that set up as a bios setting, tunable through the MB app, like it was on my old MB.",

I had memory issues at first (my bad - I bought the wrong parts) - the board told me. Not ultra-clearly, but it told me. I bought new ram and boom - it all worked. :-)What I like: 8 SATA ports, fancy LED's that give a visual impact, M.2's with heat sinks.What I did not like:-1. Lack of USB C port for my case front (so I bought a header for a few bucks and it works'ish - not full USB C but at least it saves me having a dead port - see pic for more details); and2. Lack of linux software to play with RGB settings.They are my only gripes, and with my header-to-USB-C adapter, it made neither issue a big deal.Great board. It just WORKED for me with my 3900X CPU, 64GB of ram, seven IronWolf 6TB disks and two NVMe drives. I used this in a Fractal Define 7 case and everything was in the right place for me cable wise. I love the end result. I like and recommend this mobo.",

                "reviewText": "This was my first computer build in 15 years, and I was nervous about it; fear of complications, wrong parts and broken pins. Before installing the board and putting parts on it, I watched a couple of youtube videos on \"how to put together your first computer\", read the good directions that came with this motherboard and took my time. When I got it assembled, without mishap, and plugged into a monitor and the wall, it worked!In my attached photo, you can see the motherboard inside the very nice NXZT 510 case (which I loved). I got good advice and used \"pcpartpicker.com\", a program that matches cases, motherboards, CPUs, coolers and video cards; all to make sure that they are compatible and will fit inside the case (not trivial). I would recommend you install the video card after everything else because I needed to install the SSD drive card underneath where the video card rested.My only complaint was there was no USB header (port on the board) for a type C connection to a front port on the case. When I sought help from ASRock, after having to put everything relevant in an email, I received back word that the board did not have the correct header port. I solved it eventually with a conversion insert for the board that I found without ASRock's help. For me this was pretty trivial, but with the rapid pace of changes in computer accessory connections, it is likely that others will want a USB type c connection on the front of their computer.Aesthetically, I found all the little LED lights that blink on the motherboard silly, but cute and eventually I might convert to a geek who likes all the lights. I like the full size of this motherboard, it made installing the video card (or larger CPU coolers possible and allowed someone like me with fat fingers to get fan connectors inserted without breaking off components.",

No solamente no es cierto, si no que omitieron varios detalles sobre los CPUs con los que no es compatible.Eviten esta marca, a menos que sepan los modelos exactos con los que si funcionan. El que chip diga que el BIOS es 3.3 no significa que vaya a poder reconocer el AMD CPU de la generacion que se supone que es compatible.Edit: Resulta que Asrock dio informacion falsa sobre esta MB. De preferencia estudien bien sus opciones, las especificaciones en su pagina son falsas.",
