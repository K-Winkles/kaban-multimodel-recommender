The BIOS has all the features I was looking for and almost all of them were in sensible locations with sensible names and descriptions.One click overclock works well and overclocked my 9800x to 4.6ghz all cores without any heat issues.The board accepted my 9800x even with the older bios that came in the box. The bios came out before the 9800x was announced and I was worried I would have to get another cpu to be able to update the bios to accept it. That wasn't a problem though!Cons:The board would not post with my ram set to XMP (3733 MHz). I had to clock the ram down to 3200 MHz to get it to boot. The same ram worked fine in my z370 board at XMP settings (though the ram was in dual channel on that board and quad channel on this board).",

                "reviewText": "I do 3D Animation/Motion Graphic work and I have to say...WOW!!! Excellent board!!!! New 0502 bios fixed a lot of initial release issues. Aura is now working perfectly, the new bios updated the aura lighting programming. The trick with the x299 series and this particular board for me at least was to set the cpu cores to specific core and leave everything else on auto including leave the Asus Multi Core setting to auto. This fixed all turbo boost 3.0 issues and GPU throttling issues. My benchmarks and real world performance has significantly increased with the new bios update along with the setting adjustment. Everything is rock solid stable and lightning fast. Before it seems like something was hitting the brakes but not now. For the current price of this board, it is excellent especially if you need more pci-e lanes as this contains dual plx chips. I hope intel continues a 2nd round of processors for the LGA 2066 socket and doesn't screw everyone and make you buy a new x399 intel platform like the roadmap indicates. Solid choice and in my opinion, more stable than the Gigabyte Designare EX motherboard which is the equivalent to this. Boxx tech is using the designare board in almost all x299 builds, I hope they switch to this as I trust Asus motherboards much more than Gigabyte especially for content creation workloads. Cheers!",
