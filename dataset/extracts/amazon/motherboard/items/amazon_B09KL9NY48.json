                "reviewText": "I recently decided to upgrade my 6 year old pc. I have always gone with ASUS motherboards. Have had no issues with any and they offered solid value. The problem with ASUS for this build was that none of their motherboards is compatible with the Noctura cpu cooler that I was going to use. My current build has a Corsair AIO water cooler for the cpu. But this time around I decided to go back to air cooled. The MSI Meg ACE motherboard is clearly expensive. I didn't think I would spend $600 on a motherboard. But having researched a bunch of competing motherboards it was clear that it offered more higher end features and most of all it was built like a tank. Since it was being paired with an Intel I7-12700k cpu, EVGA RTX 3080 FTW, Corsair DD5 memory, and 3 Samsung 980 pro Nvme ssd's, I decide to splurge and purchase it. I am happy that I did. It is perfect for my needs and everything went off without a hitch. The board is extremely ridged (thick). It has the voltage power to overclock any high end cpu. Nvme slots are solid and have heating thermal pads. It pretty much has all the important features that the $2000 MSI Godlike motherboard has and is a lot less. Not for everyone but if your looking for a solidly built high end motherboard, it can't be beat.",

I really like MSI's BIOS, it feels more intuitive than some of thebothers. All around great board. I'm a little disappointed that MSI did away with the gold accents and went rgb in the Z790 model.",

                "reviewText": "If you want a fully functioning motherboard from a competent manufacturer to be the powerhouse of your gaming PC, buy an Asus motherboard instead.I was originally worried about buying an Asus because of \"RAM teething\" issues, but with this motherboard I wish RAM teething issues were the only thing I had to worry about.This product is an absolute piece of crap.Some settings in the bios disable other settings, and prevent the user from changing those settings. Sometimes disabling the first setting still doesn't re-enable the user to modify the setting the bios decided to disable.Other times settings literally don't save at all. You have to enable something, restart, disable it, restart, and then enable it, just for the bios to actually enable that setting. Is it actually enabled now? Who knows. Not me. Not the bios. Certainly not the person who wrote the bios for this thing.Sometimes my motherboard wants to take a 2 year vacation mid boot with every fan on max speed while it retrains my RAM for absolutely no obvious reason.That doesn't even include features it doesn't have. Can you update the bios over the internet? NOPE. half the time I can't update the bios at all. I'll hand it the bios update file straight from the manufacturer website, only to be told THIS IS NOT MSI BIOS, should I actually try to use it.It's not like this is a cheap motherboard either. It has like some 600 dollar price tag and is still plagued with more issues than I've seen on cheaper boards. After buying this I like to think the S in MSI stands for <expletive>.This product is absolute garbage. Do not buy, and I'm never buying another MSI product again.Update:Because I finally lost my shiz enough to write yet another review of this product. I'd literally give this item 0 stars if I could. I've almost revised this review twice now... each additional time this motherboard magically screws up out of nowhere and further adds to the misery I've experienced while using this product...Today is the day I finally did it.Yet again out of nowhere I have to power cycle my PC three whole times while the thing sits there waiting for a literal 30 minutes trying to figure out what it's doing. All I can do is sit here staring at the stupid windows loading circle, seething, wondering why oh why yet again this motherboard can't get its crap together, wondering what inside of it could possibly be screwed up this time.I've literally even thought about doing a bios update. Maybe it'll fix it. Maybe I'll just write down all my settings, take a picture with my phone... whatever... but then I remember yet again that the bios software itself is such BLEEPING hotdog water and that even after yet another bios update that will likely fix absolutely nothing I'll have to fidget with some settings a literal three times between power cycles just to get them to ACTUALLY apply.If I had a time machine, I'd use it to buy bitcoin. The second thing I'd do with it is use it to not buy this motherboard. Just absolutely do not buy it. Don't buy it for yourself. Don't buy it for your enemies. This thing belongs in a land fill with the rest of the company that made it.-- Edit --8/30/2023Yet another month of my life gone by where I literally LOATHE owning this motherboard.",

                "reviewText": "It was a great price at a little over 200 dollars. I installed 7200 MHz memory but it was only stable at 6800 MHz. I'm running a 4090 founders edition with a 13900k cpu. I installed the intel be200 wifi 7 card but didn't work with this motherboard so I had to put in a wifi 6E card and that worked fine. I know the wifi 7 card works fine because I installed on another motherboard and it work great, but the wifi 7 card didn't even show up in device manager. Keep in mind the m.2 ssd limitation as the 3rd on is pcie 3.0 and the 4th and 5th m.2 slots are connected to the 3rd pcie slot and one of the sata ports. But it is a very good motherboard with lots of m.2 slots and pcie 5.0 and ddr 5 memory slots. But a lot of the reviews show damage to the motherboard with missing parts and that just didn't happen in my case. Everything looked great and works really well. And at just over 200 dollars it was a steal. I use the thunderbolt display port passthrough and it works great. Well good luck and happy shopping.",

Two times I had BSOD but that turned out to be my DDR5 memory which didn't do good with overclocking.Good quality material used all over the board and you can see and feel it.",
