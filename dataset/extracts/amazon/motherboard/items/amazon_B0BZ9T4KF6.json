                "reviewText": "Good motherboard with four RAM slots for future expansion. I have built several systems on this board in the last few months with no issues. I do find it hilarious that in 2023/2024 you can still buy a motherboard with a VGA port. I mean yes there are a few use cases for that but they are few and far between. I bet 99.9% of these boards never get anything plugged in there. I'd rather save $1 on the motherboard and not have a VGA port!",

                "reviewText": "I got back into PC's last year. I built a Core i3 12100f and 6650XT system. Great 1080p high and 1400p medium/low system for a starter. I recently upgraded to a 12600k that I got at a steal and an 6800 that I also got at a phenomenal sale price. Well into stable 1440p performance now. I was debating on just keeping the i3 and 6650xt as a backup. I instead decided to build a second system to keep at my mom's house so she has a new computer for printing documents and social media, as well as making sure I have a PC to still game on when I visit. This board was simple and I actually preferred the software in comparison to my Gigabyte B660m board I have. This board does not have all the bells and whistles, including no ARGb header or VRM heatsinks. However, this board will likely never go beyond a 12600k and my current 6800. This board now hosts the i3 and 6650xt and it is nice to have a way to play my games away from my home when I visit mom. This board with that combo performa very well and is a great way to get an affordable system. Just make sure if you want RGB you will need a case that has SATA powered fans. I am going to be buying another one soon so I can build a for sale system with an RX5500xt and I have full confidence this will make a great e-sports PC for a new or basic gamer. My only gripe with this board is that the power connectors are SUPER tight. You may think this is the PSU I used but I previously used the power supply in my previous build and those didn't have an issue with my main MB. Just worries me if I ever decide to upgrade from the 550watt unit that is currently in the system.",
