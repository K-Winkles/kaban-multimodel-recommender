It produces a quiet beep when the computer starts up, which is always a reassuring sound to this long-time PC user. When there is a problem with a computer system, those beep codes can help so much, even with modern computers. A nice quiet beep and you know all is well with the PC's self-test results and that you can look elsewhere for the cause of whatever the problem is. Or if you hear multiple beeps (a beep code), you can look the code up in your motherboard's manual to decode and zoom in quickly on possible causes.",
