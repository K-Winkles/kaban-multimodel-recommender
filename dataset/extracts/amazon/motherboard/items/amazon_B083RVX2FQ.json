I had one Dark Hero arrive with a crack in one of the DIMM slots and the other with a failing audio chip. The ASRock Nova was dead on arrival, so I decided to give GIGABYTE a chance, and I'm beyond happy I did. The motherboard is gorgeous and built like a tank. It has excellent functionality, especially for my needs. The bios has been drastically improved and is extremely easy to navigate, which is a vast improvement from what I remember. I have no issues other people have reported on, like coil whine or the motherboard not recognizing all the available RAM. The QC on mine is flawless. There's not one complaint on my end. It's running my 8000mhz 48 GB RAM kit at 7800mhz using an XMP profile with minor voltage changes with no errors on MemTest, and I'm using the Instant 6HZ feature to automatically OC my CPU. I'm using a thermal grizzly contact frame and a kryosheet. I couldn't be happier with the performance of this motherboard. I will now consider GIGABYTE boards in the future, given that they have won me over with the Master X.",

                "reviewText": "Looks to be a really nice motherboard and I was excited to get my new PC built and put the system through its paces. Unfortunately, I never even got to install the CPU because I received a board with bent pins on the CPU socket. I should have checked the motherboard before I started my build, but I was so excited to get my new PC built that I didn't open the motherboard until I was ready to install the CPU and put the motherboard into the case, only to find the socket has bent pins.I mean come on Gigabyte, a $550 motherboard should not be making it out the door with something as obvious as bent pins on the CPU socket. Thats a lack of quality control or employees not doing their job and it needs to be remedied. Im usually not upset about defects as I understand this stuff is man made and it happens, but a 550 dollar motherboard with something as obvious as bent cpu socket pins should not be making it out the door to customers hands. Thats infuriating.Im returning this one for a refund and have placed an order for the same motherboard in the meantime. Once I receive it and get it installed, I will update this review accordingly.",

                "reviewText": "This mobo has been fantastic so far. Great performance, easy to work on -- tons of IO (Minus sata).One of the main reasons I purchased this board was due to its integrated 10GbE support. Well, I just upgraded from 1gig to 10gig LAN, and I've found that not only is there sub-par performance on the RX side, but when the RX gets hammered for more than a minute or so, the entire network adapter freezes, and requires me to disable/enable the card or reboot in order to get it working again.I recently found a reddit thread of other Gigabyte Z790 Master owners having the same issue, and there is no fix from Gigabyte yet. So if you're someone planning on doing some high bandwidth application, you'll likely need to install a 3rd party SFP or NIC to get full throughput, and a stable connection.Sub 10Gbe seems to be OK. Hope this helps prevent others from the headache and time lost, that I have experienced.",
