Upon inspection I found a couple of pins that were bent and what appeared to be debris in the socket. So, I benchtested it myself. It powered up fine with 32gb ram installed in the A2/B2 slots and I got a 3 long beep RAM POST error. Took out the A2 slot RAM and it loaded to BIOS. Swapped out DIMMS in the B2 to check to see of a DIMM was bad. Restarted and it loaded to BIOS. Put the 2nd DIMM back in the A2 and got the POST error. Bent pins correlate to the memory slot, so I'm returning it for a refund. Buyer beware when it reads that it was fully tested, because if this was fully tested, they need new testers.",
