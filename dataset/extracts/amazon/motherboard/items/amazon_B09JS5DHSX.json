                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been building Desktop PC\u2019s for 20 years now and have learned from experience that if there is one critical component that can potentially arrive broken or DOA, it is usually the motherboard. So, the motherboard is always the last item on my parts list that I order in case I need to RMA it within the 30 day window. In this instance, my ASUS Z690-E arrived with a bent pin on the CPU socket. The plastic cover that is supposed to protect it was loose and banging around inside the box and most likely was the cause of the bent pin. Probably not ASUS\u2019s fault and certainly not Amazon\u2019s fault. After calling Amazon\u2019s Customer Service, I had a new motherboard replacement within 24 hours and was back on schedule. I\u2019ve always loved ASUS boards. Their motherboard manuals, abundance of features, and BIOS interface makes PC building a pleasure!! The Z690-E has room for 5 M.2 drives and 6 SATA drives, so I was able to add 10TB of storage while still leaving several slots open for future expansion. Four RAM slots, multiple headers for fans, USB 2.0, USB 3.2, USB-C, Thunderbolt, and RGB add multiple levels of versatility. The board is also Bluetooth/WiFi capable and comes with an antenna, and for those of you who have always wondered why your Bluetooth headphones don\u2019t work on a Windows PC, try plugging in the antenna and all of a sudden, they will work just fine. Updating the BIOS along with one click performance enhancement for the RAM and CPU are extremely easy with the ASUS interface. My latest Windows 11 build is fast, quiet, and very stable. It was a fun and easy build, thanks to the performance of this always critical motherboard component.",

                "reviewText": "This is probably my fifth or sixth Asus motherboard in many years of building my own systems. It seems to have retained the good build quality I expect from this manufacturer, and I encountered no serious problems in using it to build my new Windows 11 system. It is worth noting that, in addition to all the features listed, it has six 'native' SATA headers, four of which are RAID-compatible. Less experienced builders may want to note a couple of minor warnings:1) The system comes with a PCI daughterboard, which accounts for two of its M2 sockets and is intended for use with high power M2 SSD Drives. The daughterboard includes very substantial heatsinks which are in close thermal contact with the installed drives and are designed to (and should) enhance the SSDs' reliability by greatly reducing their risk of overheating. There are also three other more conventional M2 sockets under shields on the motherboard itself. The screws/clips which are used to secure the M2 cards in their sockets are packed separately in small inner bags in a 'hardware' bag. The ones to be used in the daughterboard are small flat silver screws with washers; the ones to be used on the main motherboard are somewhat longer screws with black plastic clips. The screws have identical threads, so it is possible to use them in the wrong places, but this does not work well! The documentation could be clearer on this.2) If you update the BIOS to the current version downloaded from the manufacturer's website (recommended - mine came with a very old version of the BIOS), be aware that the process takes a surprisingly long time (a few minutes). If you use the BIOS's built-in EZ-Flash program, you will be reassured by the screen displaying progress reports. If you use the 'plug in a USB drive and press the button' option, all you get is a flashing LED, and a LOT of patience is required.",

                "reviewText": "I got this motherboard for U$ 200, half its original release price and it's a great product for that money but it has some important issues:Right out of the box it has a problem with the PCIe NVE power saving mode and it will create thousands of warnings on the Windows Even Monitor, forcing you to disable it in the BIOS.The Motherboard runs incredibly hot, between 50-80 degrees. Asus support says that this is well within specks, but if you live in a hot place with no AC, this is a serious problem that should not exist in a medium high tier motherboard.On the good side, I didn't have to update the BIOS to run a 13600KF gen 13th processor.",

                "reviewText": "Very nice motherboard with a lot of connectivity, bought it new at a very nice price ($209) and paired it with a 14700K. Really did not make any sense to go with the Z790 since is it not really worth it for the price, better safe some $$$ and get a Z690. Loved the Extra M2 card that comes with this motherboard. Managed to update the bios really easy with Bios Flashback. The only downside I see is that \"do not use the top M2 slot\", otherwise it will make your video card PCI-E slot going to 8X instead of 16X, so I just used the other 2 and if I need more I'll use the expansion card that comes with the motherboard which is very high quality.",
