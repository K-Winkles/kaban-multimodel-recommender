Robust Power Design Stable power is essential to extract every last bit of performance out of AMD processors. The PRIME X670E-PRO WIFI is geared to cater to the demands of these high-core-count CPUs. 1. ProCool Connectors Proprietary connectors augment the motherboard's link to the PSU with 8+8 pin connectors that pass 12 volts of power directly to the processors. Each jack features solid pins that can handle more current than hollow-pin connectors. 2. 14+2 Teamed Power Stages 14+2 power stages combine high-side and low-side MOSFETS and drivers into packages rated for 70 amperes each, delivering power, efficiency, stability and performance to latest AMD processors.

                "reviewText": "Got this mobo a month ago (Nov'23 as of this writing.) First thing I did was update the BIOS thru the USB BIOS FlashBack method. It's pretty easy to do. If you need help, ASUS put out a video on Youtube that's only 2 minutes long .. pretty straight forward & to the point. Only thing to keep in mind with this motherboard is the boot time is rather long (about 45 seconds for mine) due to Memory Training. Since I'm new to this motherboard, I left it as is. Might tinker with it in the BIOS later on.I paired this mobo with the 7800X3D, RTX 4070, 32GB CL30 DDR5, couple of PCIE Gen 4 SSDs and a few other hard drives. When gaming, all settings are maxed out in 4K. DLSS + Frame Generation + HDR is amazingly gorgeous. Ray Tracing is turned off though. In the month since I built this system, I streamed a ton on Youtube and Twitch. I also captured lots of footage with Nvidia's Shadowplay and did quite a bit of editing with the free version of Davinci's Resolve. It's been rock solid so far!My previous setup was the legendary 4790K paired with the 1660 Super, 16GB DDR3 on the Gigabyte Z97X-Gaming 5 mobo (Yeah I know, major upgrade for me lol.) If any problems do come up, I'll be sure to update this post but so far I'm very happy with this build.",

                "reviewText": "First, the SATA ports on the right side of the board will snap off with just a slight bump. They were mounted vertically, instead of sideways which led to the initial problem. So I replaced the board because losing two SATA ports meant I couldn't use my backup drives.When the replacement board came in, it wouldn't boot. ASUS doesn't put the latest BIOS on their boards. After struggling with no boot, I tried updating the BIOS. The latest BIOS has a problem with memory. Four GSkill memory sticks that worked ok on the motherboard I was replacing were not even recognized. I finally got it to boot, but with only one memory stick.I wasted a full day working with this board. I replaced it with a MSI board which took all memory sticks, and booted with absolutely no trouble. It took 5 minutes to mount the MSI board and to get to a boot screen.So I'd not recommend this ASUS board. Too much trouble, too easy to snap off SATA connectors, won't run 4 sticks of DDR5 memory.",

Running this board with a 7800x3d, 7900XTX, and DDR5 6000mhz memory and everything has been incredibly smooth. The board is beautiful, loaded with features and inputs, and especially if you can get a decent deal from the Amazon warehouse, is an unbeatable value (though not a bad find at retail). Do update the BIOS once you receive it however - I think that's where people noting problems had issues and it was the first thing I did.",

                "reviewText": "I don't like RGB / LEDs for visual effects on motherboards; the status lights are fine. There is a way to disable these in the BIOS and it is easy to find!I do not like that the motherboard will try to install bloatware ( Armoury Crate which is linked to performance issues in gaming, etc.. ) by default. There is an option to shut it off and I always go through the bios before installing an OS - so this ended up not affecting me, but if the bios settings reset at some point in the future without telling me then it may try to install software on my computer I do not want.It has 1 NVME x5, 2 at 4x and 1 at 3x. One of the 4x slots disables the 2 side angled sata ports - but the 2 on the bottom will work. I don't use sata connectors much anymore so I can live with 2 and with the 5x port I have room to grow.The drivers were very easy to find on their website, and I used NTLite to slipstream my Windows install - and the big thing: The NVME driver on their website actually worked. There have been a few boards in the past where it doesn't. There is also an option in the BIOS for NVME native support which is on by default. So the entire install process was hands free.Installing the OS took less than 5 minutes with all of my settings having been input into NTLite prior to plugging the USB drive in.Updating the BIOS took longer than the OS Install, which I did prior to anything. They notify you to reset the BIOS configuration PRIOR to installing - This is likely because of stability concerns which could brick your board if they don't have a backup BIOS slot, but they could do this in the background and restore settings after the install to make it more user friendly.Inexpensive board with good feature-set.-------Update: Still takes a long time to boot, but I am getting micro-stuttering in applications, games, media, etc.. Could be the CPU, could be the board. Either way this board takes way too long to boot.",

Went to the next bios update (Version 0809) seemed fine but had random freezing and blue screens. As I installed windows I thought maybe the memory was bad or heat.Ran mem test and tested the (Corsair Dominator Platinum RGB DDR5 32GB (2x16GB) 6000MHz C36 EXPO) memory and found a lot of memory errors. Was saddened by this as this was the first time I bought Corsair and always stuck to Kingston memory.The next day I tried the BIOS Version 0821 - and all is well I did reinstall windows again and boy it runs like a dream now.I'm running a 7600X with a Kinston M.2 gen4 2tb drive and man it is fast. even with normal boot mode.Hope it lasts as long as the other ASUS mobos. I've had and worked on. No joke, for ever... longer then you'd keep the system. Last one was 10 years and still kicking.I worked in a known PC shop and will always put ASUS above all the other brands as their failure % is way lower then ALL other brands. This is with my 13+ years as a system builder professionally .Hope this helps you guys and gals. You wont regret buying this MOBO. Its just Classy and sexy. and looks better then the ROG white one IMO.",
