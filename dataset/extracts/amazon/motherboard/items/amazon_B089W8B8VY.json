I will point out this motherboard requires 2x8 pins: one to power the motherboard and one to power the peripherals. I Was running perfectly fine with only one 8 pin connected until I upgraded my GPU. I intend on updating this review to confirm the shut down is caused by the missing power cable. Overall I am satisfied and will continue to buy Asrock motherboards for the power to price ratio.Update: the additional pins, distributing more power essentially-worked well. May have stability issues with overclocking ram above 3200; user discretion advised.",

This motherboard has a debugger for no reason also because its super hard to actually tell what number it gives since it spits out a whole bunch of numbers at once vs the msi tomahawk that just has 3 error lights cpu/ram/vram. Ran light games but any time i run a heavy game like warzone or tarkov my pc shuts down i tested every other component and had to spend money buying different ram and psu and had to ask a friend to let me borrow gpu and i would still have the same shut down issue. Wouldnt wish this upon anyone. Never buying asrock again",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. You can see in my video that I have rgb running, however in my case there is an RGB on top, now . READ THIS IF YOU HAVE AN 4 PIN RGB. BEWARE THE MANUAL TELLS YOU THE WRONG CONFIGURATION.According to the manual its 12V-G-R-B , and I followed it, now my RGB strip is damaged, in reality the pinout was B-R-G-12V... Now I have a non working RGB, so ignore the manual for that part. and read what it says on the motherboard pcb.My other issue is that I wanted to install a wifi card, however I am unable to remove the IO cover to install the antennas. even though you can unscrew it on the bottom I was not able to remove the IO, just open it a bit. also if you plan to install in the board a wifi card make sure that internal antenna wires you have are longer than 6 inches, 6 inches is not enough to clear out the first PCI slot.",
