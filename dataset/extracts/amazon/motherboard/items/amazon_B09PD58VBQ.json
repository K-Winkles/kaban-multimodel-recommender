But for the lack of a manual I would have given 5 stars. I strongly suggest you print out the product pictures at the top of the ad to help decipher the proper connections. Due to the lack of a manual, this board is probably not appropriate for beginners. Be aware that there is no built in video connection or WiFi and only one pci slot. This board allowed me to resurrect an older PC using cannibalized parts: CPU, video card, ram and drives.",

                "reviewText": "I came back to edit my review, because I'm having trouble with this mobo now. I stand beside what I said below, but I'm now having trouble with one of the 2 I have, and the other doesn't get used as much. Now the PC reboots randomly and sometimes never gets past the BIOS POST before rebooting. To be fair, it could be my power supply, but it cost me more than the mobo if I remember correctly. I've swapped out the CPU once and the DIMMs several times, since I have spares. The seller does not seem to be taking questions any more, and the links at the top of their store page don't work. I guess I'm stuck. Well, Machinist, I hope to be getting my hands on an E5-2680 or 2690 and DDR4 soon, and I WILL NOT be buying a Machinist mobo to put those in. (Your mileage may vary....)Original Review:I now have 2 of these boards, one running Windows 10 and one running Windows 11. They have 10-core Xeon E5-2670 v2 CPUs and 64GB of DDR3-1866 RAM, and one boots off a SATA M.2 stick. They do not provide a printed manual with the board. Make sure you read all the info in the listing, and especially all the Q&A if you are going to use a SATA M.2 or NVMe M.2 stick - the jumper settings they show seem to be reversed. Also, since the board has no onboard video, you'll need a PCIe video card. Some of the components near the CPU socket made it so one heat sink I already had wouldn't fit so I had to buy one. I don't know if I'd recommend this board to a complete beginner, but for anyone with some experience building PCs it is a breeze to get going.",

This board is stable, and uses the unconventional server chipset with custom bios. Linus discussed this in a video; it\u2019s an effective way to recycle bad server boards and reduce eWaste. I\u2019m using a cheap quad core Xeon to use as a basic machine at my work for iTunes, backing up hard drives, and other assorted pc/phone tech support things. Have had no issues with this board, nor other Machinist boards I\u2019ve encountered in the past.If you\u2019re looking to recycle some old parts and make a functional machine for home use (gaming would also be good with the right CPU, a 3930k or something) then this will tick all the boxes.",
