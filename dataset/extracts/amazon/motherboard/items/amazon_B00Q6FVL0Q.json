                "reviewText": "This board worked great! Had an older computer that would not switch on with out unplugging for at least 30 minutes and fiddling around with the power button. Replaced power source with no change. Figured I'd give a new motherboard as the next possible solution. Already had lots of ddr3 ram and a cheapo video card so I wanted a board that supported that. First time replacing a motherboard and it was super easy. Only issue I had was the power switch connections where different. No problem. Just wired up a simple switch to turn it on. Fired it up and it booted up right away! I did not need to reinstall windows. Took about 2 hours to install and boot up then update a bunch of drivers and I was good to go! Only thing I didn't care for was all the software I didn't need that it try's to load when inserting the disc that comes with it. I guess that helps them keep the costs down so not a big deal. Great product at this price point.",

As the other board was no longer available I chose this board as the closest I could find for the money though this board cost more and offered less. My wife chose the number of stars based on performance. At the time I was sweating my diagnosis that it was the board and not the CPU that died. I chose correctly!",
