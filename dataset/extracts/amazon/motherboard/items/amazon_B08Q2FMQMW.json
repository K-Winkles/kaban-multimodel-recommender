Since my name starts with C, this board is perfect for its C designation. The processor installed currently is an i5-10400. My dad gave me that processor, so it has some sentimental value, so I am extremely happy the 10400 survived the PSU failure despite everything else being KIA. This platform is now 3 generations behind, so I have no real idea why I am typing this review, but I purchased it used for half a hundred and as a result is now the cheapest motherboard i have purchased to date with zero defect. I am absolutely satisfied that an IO shield was included despite the description saying that no packaging or accessories were included with the board, so i wasn't expecting an IO shield, plus two sata cables, so my expectations were already exceeded.My plans now are to build a game console like computer, this time around with a more reliable power supply, because I'm not sure how many more PSU failures this processor will take. I am overall satisfied.",

                "reviewText": "Firstly, when I installed the MOBO my SSD suddenly failed so I thought the mobo was faulty, it was actually my cheap offbrand SSD that failed is faulty. This had nothing to do with the MOBO itself.You may encounter problems using the ethernet so keep in mind if your ethernet driver is different, you WONT have ethernet and you will need a wifi adapter and software already ready to use so that you may update your drivers. If you are not prepared to install a MOBO without internet, then be careful! If you have a disk driver, you are totally fine as the disk that comes with it provides all utilities and drivers needed!GPU: The mobo DOES NOT fully utilize GPU capabilities. Because of this, I will likely have to return it. I noticed my GPU was not being fully utilized when I was playing video games and sadly this is due to the BIOS not properly being updated. There is a BETA BIOS version that tries to fix this but that actually soft bricked my MOBO when I tried to use it with my 2060 super Nvidia GPU. So please keep this in mind when updating your BIOS to version 1.3. I had to remove my GPU and downgrade it to a stable 1.2 version to work.The RAM slot only supports up to like 2900mhz so also keep that in mind. If you have any bit of RAM that goes beyond 3000mhz this MOBO will downclock it.The CPU seems to NOT be bottlenecked by the MOBO. I have a 10600k and it runs very nicely on it. However, I do notice that I get lag spikes when playing video games and this was often due to my GPU running up to only 80 percent.This is indeed a micro-atx and as it is widely known, micro-atx MOBOs are widely known for not being able to fully utilize your hardware, as well as have less support, and less updates. This is NOT always the case, only for mid rage or low range MOBOs and id consider this a low range.The MSI BIOS is actually very well made, I commend MSI for its BIOS. You can do EVERYTHING here when it comes to overclocking your CPU. There is NO GPU overclocking that I could find in the BIOS however. This MOBO is not meant to run powerful graphics cards to their full capabilities, nor overclock them however you can certainly still throw a rather powerful GPU in it and it will run fine, mostly.There are no further problems that I have found. If you have any questions, ask them here and ill try to answer. Have a wonderful day.PS: Due to the issues, such as the BETA BIOS almost bricking my MOBO and due to spending about 3 hours just to set the damn thing up with no issues, I will take off 2 stars. MSI seriously needs to work on not only improving their updates on MSI products, but also not haphazardly giving out BETA updates for the BIOS without any warning at all that it might actually brick your system.However, because I love MSI and to this day they have done a wonderful job with their products, (I have a GPU from over 7 years ago that used to be top of the line and it STILL works wonderfully.) I will add another star. MSI continues to set boundaries for well made BIOS MOBOs that are decently updated for an exceptionally low price. Few can contend with this motherboard and its price. If any at all.I assure you, no motherboard out there exists for this price that has such well-made BIOS overclocking abilities and stability. Yes, I encountered issues, but they were all resolved. That's all that matters. You will not go wrong buying this if you are on a low-cost budget.",

                "reviewText": "Intel 10gen boards are on the way out, but still an entry point for Windows 11 on the cheap. If you want hardware based TPM 2.0, you'll need to buy an MSI specific module. (Here's one: https://amzn.to/3XwPT6W my support link) I'm fine with the firmware based TPM so don't see the need to spend the dollars on it.I installed an INTEL i3-10100T (chip only) and a cooler I had on hand, because I found this processor for a cheap price. But I think if I had it to do over I'd rather have purchased the INTEL i3-10105 bare chip that I found for slightly more after I made my purchase.The chip runs very cool at its native speed of 3.00 GHz, as in 80deg F.. This causes the CPU and system fans to run at a low RPM making the system very quiet. But if you want to tweak the speed there are plenty of OC features on this board to try out.The biggest selling point for me was that this board was cheap, because it was a pull. As long as the seller is reputable I don't mind buying slightly used MBs.",
