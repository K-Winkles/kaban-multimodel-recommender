Here's a review of the motherboard with a final rating of 7.2/10:Build Quality (7/10): The build quality is decent for the price, with a standard micro-ATX form factor. It may not have the premium feel of higher-end motherboards, but it does not lack what matters.Connectivity (6/10): One of its key selling points is the inclusion of built-in Wi-Fi, which is a valuable addition for users who prefer a wireless connection. However i found that the Wi-fi was avg at best and would say connecting via a ethernet would still trump it.Price (8/10): One of the main strengths of the B450M DS3H WiFi is its affordability. It offers good value for the price, making it an attractive option for budget-conscious users who still want a decent feature set.Over all like i said at the top 7.2 out of 10 get it if you need a budget board!",

M2 slot. 4x SATA ports, just in case you need that much from a budget board.It was instantly compatible with my new Ryzen 5600GT, which I bought on release day.

                "reviewText": "After a week or so of fine usage I ended up getting BSOD's randomly throughout the week with no real reason. Hypervisor error, Kernel Security?, Driver Less than Equal... those 3 specifically. None of them really correlate with a specific part. I assumed it might be the RAM and bought a set on the QVL list to try and rule it out but I BSODed 30 min ago. The CPU could be faulty but I feel like that's something that either works or doesn't and that part has had no issues working. This board also has a lack of fan headers too so beware if you want to take that chance. I'm out of the refund window so i'm SOL, I'm gonna get an ASUS board and not get bottom bin boards from now on.",

There were many occasions where there was no signal received by the monitor in the process of booting up. Bios posting was okay but black screen when it started to load windows 11. When rebooted, it always stopped at\"Windows was not properly shut down\" and repeating the same problem if restarting the pc. I tried with both integrated graphic and discrete graphic card, new hdmi cable and different monitors, all don't help. It somehow managed to boot up properly after many trial and errors. Initially, I suspected it could be a power problem or defective motherboard but when I googled trying to find a solution, I then realised that there many reporting similar problem. Could it be a bios problem rather than issue of defective hardwares.",
