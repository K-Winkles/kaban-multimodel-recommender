The processor is very adequate for most games along with a good video card. I'm really happy with the MSI board. Again you can get better MB's but this one works well to say the least. Great website to help you set things up. Straight forward board, clean and easy to work with. I didn't really like the screws and standoffs... I couldn't get anything to seat correctly so just used better quality items I had on hand. The CPU cooler seems adequate and I haven't had any heating issues. All in all very nice little setup.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not docking Microcenter for this as the product was as expected but I will follow up my formal complaint here. The driver threw this about 12ft onto my porch, took her photo, then scurried away before I could get to her it (was in the field out back walking the dog). I sent a complaint at the time of service but it was of course ignored. Otherwise I use this for gaming and 3D modeling, works great. Not the best on speed but it does the job well.",

                "reviewText": "Update: 12 Jan 2024: The motherboard made it back from MSI after I RMA'ed it. I hooked it all back up and the same problems persist, the M.2 slot #1 does not work, only the M.2 #2 slot works. Looking at the RMA Status tracker, they got my package in, started repairs, and mailed it back out to me the next day. There are no notes to describe what they did to fix it and upon inspecting the board, it doesn't look like anything was done at all. At this point I'm going to cut my losses and look for a new motherboard of a different manufacturer. MSI used to be my go-to brand. I can understand and forgive a mistake that would cause me to get a faulty board, but the fact that it wasn't fixed after RMA'ing the board and that I shipped it at my expense and they turned around and sent it back without fixing the issue is unforgivable and shows that there are deeper problems with company. Unfortunately for me, it is a costly lesson to learn involving MSI products.I ordered the MB & CPU combo as part of a larger order to build my son a new PC for his birthday. The parts had to sit in a box for a couple weeks because the birthday wasn't until later. I ended up building the PC about 2 weeks after it arrived. During the build, I discovered that the NVMe M.2 port #1 was bad and would not show my drive in the UEFI. I tried to re-seat the drive several times, but to no avail. The port looked fine with no bent pins or anything. I ended up having to move it to the #2 M.2 slot for the drive to be read. I checked the manual and found out that if you have a drive in the #2 slot, you are not able to use the PCI-E x4 slot. So then I had to move the WiFi card I bought to the bottom slot, which didn't have an opening for the case I bought. I didn't feel like taking the MB out and sending it in if that was the only problem, so I cut a hole in the case I had bought where the card would go and everything was working after that. Within a week my soon started having issues with the network connection cutting out. I did a ping to the WAP and noticed huge amounts of jitter from around 1000ms to 6000ms. I used a spectrum analyzer and didn't see anything that would cause interference. I put a laptop next to the PC using the same 802.11ac standard and it worked fine with no issues. So I thought it might be the antenna or the WiFi card. I brought out a USB 802.11ac WiFi NIC. It was having the same issues. Then I would disable the WiFi cards and re-enable them and they would work fine for a few minutes and then stop working. Then in the last two days, they will not work anymore and if I do anything inside of device manager, the system freezes. It still isn't 100% confirmed that the WiFi issues are from the Motherboard, but the evidence is starting to point towards it heavily. PCs can be weird sometimes. I've been working in IT for about 30 years and teaching IT at a college for about 3 years now. It can surprise you what the problems are sometimes. If for nothing other than the M.2 port being, this board needs to be replaced. Unfortunately, I am a few days past the 30 day return period from Amazon now, and if I would have bought the thing a few days later than what I did, it would have fallen into the holiday return policy and I would have had until January to return it. Now I am trying to RMA the board directly with MSI. I'll update how it goes here. This is my 3rd board MSI from this combo deal that I have bought within the last 6 months. One of the boards I bought 6 months ago is working fine so far. The second board I bought last month was running fine, but is starting to have weird stutters and slow downs, but it could be applications causing the issues. This one is looking like it is going to continue to get worse if I don't return it and get it replaced. Make sure you get the system built as soon as possible if you plan to get one and make sure to make sure everything is functioning before you hit that 30 days. Over the years I have found that Motherboards have the strangest problems that sometimes take a while to really figure out. so you might be better off going with a different seller who has a better return policy if you can find it.",
