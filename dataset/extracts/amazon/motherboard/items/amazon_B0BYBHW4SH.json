                "reviewText": "- The motherboard is honestly really good, all the cable connectors are in nice places, the BIOS is rather nice and simple, lots of storage and connectivity options, including fans and PCI-E slots.The motherboard is amazing at it's price, however it does have some booting problems AT THE FIRST BOOT, after the first boot, there is no issues with the motherboard ( so far ).> By bootability, I believe it has issues with the DDR5 Ram Training process, I think it takes too long with it, or doesn't do it at all, so after you install your ram, do not move it places after it boots. Or you'll have to go trough this again. You will likely have to go trough this again if you end up purchasing more ram and install it.> The way I fixed this issue was by putting the ram sticks where I wanted them, left the computer on for 5 minutes, then turned it off, removed the A1 Ram stick, left A2 on, turned it on again, and it booted,then after I was at windows, while the computer was on, I installed the A1 ram stick again, then restarted, went into bios, applied settings, restarted again and this seemed to do the trick for me. Haven't had any issues with booting again.Other then that issue, I love this motherboard, cable management and speeds on it are great. It has a nice manual, although I wish it has more info on the 12V1 power connector.",

If you don\u2019t have any problems with the amount of io ports, then this is probably for you. I did want to get the B650 Aorus Elite AX, but that wouldn\u2019t arrive until January in my area, so I decided to get this instead, and it works great. Only thing I have to say is make sure what revision your motherboard is, you\u2019ll need to type that in as well when you look for the bios update, mine was 1.3, so I needed to type in B650 Gaming X AX rev 1.3 bios download, I clicked support, then downloads, and found the bios I needed and downloaded it. It works perfectly, just wish it had more ports on the back. And if you\u2019re wondering about WiFi it comes with a WiFi antenna, it doesn\u2019t hit my max speed, but it hits about 450 mbps, or 60 mb/s download speed. Though this is only if your WiFi is fast enough, keep that in mind.",

                "reviewText": "Built a PC last night, Ryzen 7800x with this motherboard. Posted on first boot, successfully. However every time I exited a fullscreen game, the monitor would permanently go blank and I had to reset CMOS to get it working again. Very annoying. This resolved only after I updated the BIOS from F3 to F7b version (latest as of June 2023).Also wifi is finicky - lots of packet drops, not worth it. If the non-wifi version is cheaper, I recommend to buy that, and buy a uBit wifi card instead.",

                "reviewText": "Compared to several other motherboards I've built systems with, the labels on the board of this one were much clearer. With others, I need to reference the manual to understand what to connect where. I downloaded the manual for this one (direct from the manufacturer support page because the link for manual download on this Amazon page goes to the wrong manual). But I had no need for the manual.The BIOS is friendlier than most, including the ability to enable the on-board graphics even when a PCIe graphics card is installed. My PCIe card has only one hdmi connector and I didn't have an adapter handy and wanted to test something with two hdmi-only monitors at once. So I just plugged one into the motherboard hdmi. Most BIOS's (that I've used) unconditionally disable that basic feature. Using Fedora Linux (I think it works the same way on Windows, but didn't test) the PCIe GPU is used (by default) for rendering even for the on-board graphics connector (I assume the on-board graphics is used for refresh). Anyway, gaming performance isn't measurably hurt by that path. It just takes a tiny chunk of system ram and system ram bandwidth compared to connecting directly to the PCIe graphics.This rev 1.3 motherboard came with BIOS version FB. My son thinks (but we didn't measure carefully) that the memory timing features are better on a newer BIOS. So we upgraded to the newest BIOS version: FA1a. Don't use that BIOS. That did change (likely improve) timing features, but it entirely broke some communication from the OS to the BIOS, so sleep didn't work and the Linux Grub menu choice going directly to BIOS setup (without needing to hit a key at the right moment during boot) also broke. So we switched to the second newest, which is FC. That has the timing improvements (vs. the original FB) without any of the bugs of FA1a. The BIOS upgrade (or downgrade) feature was easy, nearly idiot proof.",
