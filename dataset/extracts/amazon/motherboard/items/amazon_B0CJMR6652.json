No clue.I have the 14700K and G.SKILL Trident Z5 RGB Series DDR5 RAM 32GB (2x16GB) 6400MT/s. Also using two Samsung 980 Pros a 1TB and a 2TB. And a Gigabyte 4090. Those others could be using different components that are causing issues. Oh I'm also on Win11.Not too much to say about this motherboard. It looks cool and has plenty of M.2 slots. Oh it doesn't have that annoying double cycle my old ASUS motherboard had, so it hard boots way faster than my previous 11th gen one. I updated the bios with no issue and everything is still working great. Works as good as any motherboard should. No complaints.",

Windows 11 did not recognize the built-in LAN adapter so I had to go through some gyrations to install the OS. Layout was well thought out but it was not obvious from the start. I came to the realization that it is important to get contemporaneous computer parts in order for the assembly to work well - for example, new SSD instead of using old SATA drives. But that is my personal preference. It is the first computer I put together where I was, in the end, very satisfied that the disparate parts appeared to have been made for each other. Other components - ASUS ROG Dual 4060 display card, ASUS ROG 850W power supply, Noctua fanless head sink with fan, i9 12900k CPU. The ASUS BIOS had a built-in memory test that brought up the CPU temperature to 70 deg Celsius but not higher. Did not implement overclocking.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a motherboard for my new desktop build that had a LGA 1700 CPU socket and a large number of USB ports since I seem to need them. I also liked the five M2 SSD slots in this board now that I've transitioned away from HHDs. It has builtin WiFi and bluetooth too, which is a plus. A feature I like is a quick release button for the upper PCIe slot, that makes it easy to remove the graphics card if needed to get access to the areas underneath. The motherboard comes with a \"Quick Start Guide\", but do yourself a favor and visit the Asus website and download a full user guide which will explain the installation process much better.",

                "reviewText": "Well, I found this board last minute as it's only been out a few weeks as of writing this. What a difference. Gen5, DDR5, 5 M2 slots, wifi 7? who needs that, you do that's who. I put a 14900KF, deep cool LT720, 2TB Samsung 990, 2x4TB Crucial leaving me with 2 spare M2 slots. My 5600 RAM 24GBx4 worked just fine with XMP. I have an Asus 6e wifi router and with this was actually seeing 750mbps briefly with 250mbps as an average, meaning it's close to ethernet for all practical purposes.For the few bucks extra I'm glad I went this route.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a fan of ASUS motherboard. It's what I've used in my last 3 builds and haven't had any issues with them. My last board was a Z290 and it still runs great, I just needed to upgrade to a faster CPU. Their BIOS is very easy to use, the board layouts are well done, and they just seem to work. This board is the first one I've run into issues with, and it's due to the Intel 226-V Ethernet chip.As of writing this review (1/23/24), this chip has a known issue where it will randomly disconnect. There are some troubleshooting tips online, but ultimately I've found they do not remedy the issue. Some of the steps include rollback firmware, downgrading the speed to 1GB full, using ASUS vs Intel drivers... the list goes on. If you'll only be using Wifi, you won't encounter this issue as the wifi NIC uses a different chipset. However, I'm still not going to recommend the board, simply because a component that you're buying isn't 100% reliable.You always have the option of buying a PCIe NIC, which is my workaround, but this is a problem that Intel needs to fix with their firmware before this board is one I'd suggest.",
