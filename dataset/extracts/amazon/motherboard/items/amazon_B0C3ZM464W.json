                "reviewText": "This is a fine basic board for midrange Intel based systems. If you're on a budget and looking to get into the latest generation Intel chip this will work fine, but keep in mind it lacks overclocking abilities so it's best paired with non K processors. Enthusiasts, especially those who want to overclock, will be better served by a more feature rich chipset. Those building a basic gaming machine on a budget will be served just fine by this board. If you're going beyond the i5 series you'll want at least a B660 chipset.The reason this only gets four stars is the lack of USB ports. It has, I kid you not, FOUR USB PORTS! There is clearly a space where two more used to go, but it appears ASUS cut two of these ports out at some point. Earlier mentions of this board online state it has six. There is no excuse for this and it's definitely something to keep in mind if you're running a lot of USB accessories.PROS- Affordable- Good BIOS software- 2 x M.2 slots. Many boards in this price range have only one.- 2 case fan headers. Again, many boards in this segment have only one.CONS- Only four USB ports, and only two of those are USB 3.0! There is no excuse for this.- Not enough board to fully take advantage of higher end chips. Stick with the i5 for best results.",
