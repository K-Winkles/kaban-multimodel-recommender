Was contemplating between The same Board But the DDR5 and the 13th Gen Intel i7-13700K, But not gonna do editing,Stream Not do a have a GPU to pair with that cpu,offers a lot but don't need a lot. Even think the i7-12700K is a lot what is it 12Cores 20Threads Pfff geez,Guess given my mid high age mat out live me. Any how what really wanted to share is you do not need to configure Anything in the Bios if ur installing windows 11 or an NVMe M.2 Drive as I thought I would have to but I watched a YouTube video the person Reviewing the Board I bought the one that said o need to configure nothing it does it all for you minus the Ram when ur done setting up and installing windows 10 or 11 just go back in the Bios and simply Click Xmp and save and will clock ur Ram at the what mid Rate or what ever the Given Ram you bought, but if you further want to tweak it I am more then sure it will achieve I higher OC , me my self am OK with what ever XMP Gives. I have not installed windows yet but I did have the USB bootloader in a USB, but didnt.want to yet install ot just wanted to male sure it posted, as can see it Reconized my NVMe with out configuration, I did Flash Button Bios B4 turning on the system for the first time,was nervous uz when I live they cut the power grade at time without notice and they did it when I was gonna flash bios, I got Lucky. But all is good if ur contemplating and ur looking to buy same.bunle go for it let no one tell you any different, so far all the review speak truly positive of that borad, Hope this help someone that's looking to buy same Bundle. On another OTE I may Rewrite this Reviw to inform how Awesome the Results and my take a few pix we'll see, just Go on now buy it if been resting heavily on ur mind...",

                "reviewText": "I opened a web ticket with MSI and and got a quick response telling me to update BIOS. I responded stating I cannot update the BIOS as the computer fails POST and does not boot. Even when I google ways to update the BIOS on MSI, everything states to enter BIOS. I get no video from the onboard video so I can't see if I am entering BIOS setup or not. Have not heard a thing from MSI support since. POOR Support in my eyes.I have never had an issue with the seller. In fact I really miss living by one like I did a few years ago. The MSI motherboard does not Post, all I get is red/yellow blinking lights before stopping yellow. Which points to RAM. The RAM I purchased is listed as acceptable RAM on MSI list of approved RAM. So I bought more RAM (never hurts having more) and same issue. Registration of the motherboard is horrible with the manufacturer as you have to create an account and they share your information with a 3rd party advertising agency so I am giving my email and name to someone who is going to inundate me with SPAM. I am so sorry I went with MSI. And I will never do that again. I have always used a different brand, but I wanted to save money (had I still lived near the sellers store I could have bought the brand of MB I prefer, gotten the processor I got and the RAM I got as a bundle) but since they do not do online sales other than through here, I was limited and could not get a break on the RAM. Lesson learned: You get what you pay for. I am so disgusted with MSI over the registration that I am dreading trying to file a warranty claim. I wish I could just send this board back and buy the brand I prefer as the RAM I have is on their list too.",

Was unable to get past the latest 22H2 update and even re-install failed. Transferred everything over to this motherboard and cpu combo and re-installed windows 11 pro while keeping apps and files and everything works perfectly now. Would recommend this combo.",

                "reviewText": "I haven't built that PC in years so I decided to build one this year. Initially I picked up Asus motherboard but that turned out to be very buggy and troublesome.Then I saw this deal and I was like let me give it a try at first I got the motherboard with damage components but I was able to replace it with another one that came in perfect shape.No everything is running great I had to get rid of my water cooler and used the big heat sink instead and my temperatures have been hovering between 25 Celsius to 30.Would definitely recommend!",
