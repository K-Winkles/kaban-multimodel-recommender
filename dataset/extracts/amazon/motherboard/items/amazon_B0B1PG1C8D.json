                "reviewText": "This board was just introduced in mid-2022 and I assume the price reflects its newness, as well as Evangelion's participation in its marketing.The visual impact is stunning - neon green and purple - again I believe due to the Evangelion contribution. We purchased this for one of our clients who insists having the \"Newest and Greatest\" in his equipment and we have been making him builds for a couple of years now.With PCIe 5.0, the M2's, Thunderbolt, and USB 3.2 2x2 there is not much more you can add to a board. Although, I'm not sure why they didn't give it a 10gb ethernet port so we will be adding a board into the build for that. It also comes with their ROG Hyper card for 4 NVMe M.2 Hyper card which supports the PCIe 5.0. We have used a similar card from another manufacturer and it was unbelievability fast - but not stable. When the unit was booted many times you had to reboot a couple times to get it recognized so eventually it had to be removed. Hopefully this won't have the same problem.We are still conferencing as to the case that this will install in and obviously it must be something special. I am recommending the AZZA Regis PC Case but it is obviously up to our client the ultimate decision. When we do build we'll add more info and photos to this review.",

                "reviewText": "This board looks great, and it's easy to setup. Love the three M2 HDD slots on board. My new PC build ran beautifully for about two weeks, and I was loving this board. Fast, runs very cool; it was everything I was hoping for.During install, though, I found that the primary DIMM slot was inoperable. I have two 16GB sticks, and installed them in the two recommended slots, but the computer wouldn't start, and the board was throwing code 55 (no memory installed). I moved the stick from the primary slot to another slot in a \"not recommended\" configuration, and the computer fired right up.Like I said, the computer ran beautifully for a few weeks, but one day out of nowhere it froze up and rebooted itself. During the reboot, it kept freezing; over and over and over. I could always get to the BIOS, but it continually froze during Windows boot. Only once did I make it to a login prompt after literally 4 hours of trying. I tried to do a Windows reset and reinstall multiple times, but the computer always froze and couldn't complete the operation.Took the computer to my trusted repair shop, and they had the same problems I did. When I mentioned the inop DIMM slot, first words out of the guy's mouth was \"warranty this board. It's damaged.\" I contacted ASUS and got an RMA, shipped it back (my cost for 2-day air, because this is my primary work computer and it wanted it back ASAP, was $126. Ouch.Just got the board back today, two weeks later. ASUS was unable to repair the board, so they sent me a factory re-furbished replacement. Installed everything, and surprisingly got the same error on the primary DIMM slot as before (code 55), so like before I moved the two sticks to another pair of slots and everything booted up just fine. I was happy again. For two hours. Then it froze, attempted to reboot, and I was right back to the same failure cycle as before.I did a lot of troubleshooting, swapping out individual memory sticks to isolate them as a problem (no problems with the sticks). I then pulled my video card to see if it was causing problems (it's the only IDE component installed), and plugged an HDMI cable into the one HDMI port on the board, only to discover that there was no signal coming from that. Now the replacement board is exhibiting the same two physical problems as my first board. Looks like I got two lemons with the same defect.ASUS is escalating my case to the next layer of support, but who knows what the solution will be. Needless to say, I'm very frustrated.I want to love this board.Update: The replacement motherboard had the same problems as the first. I returned it and this time was told that there was damage to it caused by me. After charging me $130 and shipping back to me two weeks later, I put my PC back together and of course, had the exact same problems. Exasperated, I took the whole computer to a repair shop and asked them to figure out what's wrong. After extensive troubleshooting, they determined that not only was the motherboard bad (the third one), but my CPU was bad, too. I ended up buying a completely different board and new CPU, and processed a return for both the board and the CPU. Thankfully, Amazon honored my refund request, even though my purchase was four months ago.Avoid this board. I went 3 for 3 with bad ones.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. When I first saw this board was available, I wanted it! But I looked at the price and decided, I really didn't need a gaming board, especially at that price. Well, a couple months later I look on the ASUS website, and see there is also a matching case... I was hooked! They also have many other matching themed items, but I did not get them, but may later.I did some research on the newer 12th generation Intel CPUs this uses, and was blown away by how much better the 12th generation CPUs are then the previous generations! I ended up pairing this MB with the i5-12600K I am not gaming with it so I did not even buy a GPU, as the GPU in the i% has some pretty decent specs especially for watching Videos, which really will be one of the main things I will use this overkill of a system for. The 12th generation CPUs are basically 40% more efficient than the 11th generation! So same work for 40% less power, or 40% more work for the same power!But the coolness of this board and the matching ASUS case are what made be buy this system. Be warned though, the case is GIGANTIC and HEAVY, I have no idea why they call it a MID TOWER!",
