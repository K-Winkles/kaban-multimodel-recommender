The DRAM LED was illuminated, so I just powered down the system, reseated my RAM cards, and started back up. The system posted without a problem after that. The only other hiccup I ran into was I needed to install the WiFi driver before to get WiFi up and running. This is kinda silly, as it requires you to have another computer to download the drivers (either LAN or WiFi) in order to get connectivity. Nothing that a Chromebook and thumb drive can\u2019t fix, but it still just seems silly. ASUS should just include those drivers out of the box.I\u2019m running an AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, ASUS TUF 4070Ti, and 32BG of G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo RGB DDR5 RAM on Windows 11. The system works great, and I\u2019m very happy with this motherboard purchase.",

Some tight fits (to gain access to one of the m.2 slots you have to remove the GPU, ATX power connection location is TIGHT)*Important note* The previous MB I got from ASUS arrived damaged. The customer service rep at ASUS was terrible and told me I'd have to pay an initial investigation fee of $30 plus shipping and whatever else is needed. Really terrible service but Amazon was awesome and gave me a refund so and I ended up purchasing this MB.Tldr; It's a solid 7.5/10. Not the best, some slight hiccups here and there but does the job. I'm happy with it.",

Bad idea, I look at all the manuals, and make sure I'm doing things correctly, by the book. Everything went all right until we got to booting it up, The Motherboard lights turned on, as well as the DRAM light, but no other LEDs, which are important. I try to troubleshoot it by moving wires around. still doesn't work. I then read online how to do a BIOS flash, which is testing to see if it was the motherboard that was bad and not the CPU, still not booting. All this while I was contacting support, looking for any solution, they then asked for us to ship it in for a diagnostic, which we had to not only pay for shipping but also pin damage we didn't see before we shipped it. After 2 weeks and 115 dollars, the board returns, I put it back together again and it goes quicker and smoother than the first time. STILL the same issue, with no boot, but at least motherboard lights, DRAM light, and 1/3 of fans are working. I'm now sending this board back, no visible damage, at least not done by me. I'm sending this motherboard back, hoping to get a full refund, and I'm going to buy a different brand.Not recommended since I'm seeing the same issue with this board amongst the other 1-star reviews.",

                "reviewText": "This motherboard is really good if you are looking to build a PC for gaming and maybe some hobby stuff like video editing.HOWEVER, one major thing you must consider before buying this motherboard is -The bottom most PCIE slot and the Nvme slot SHARE THE SAME MOTHERBOARD CHIPSET EXPRESSLANE.Meaning: you can either use only one of the slots NOT BOTH.Consider this before buying.What problems can you face with this?Not much really.Lemme give you an example.Me personally, I am using the PCIE slot for a video capture card and I don't plan on using the Nvme slot.So if you are a gamer that wants all the storage and maybe wants to stream, this motherboard cannot offer both unless you decide to use another PC for streaming.It's either use the Nvme slot for storage or use the PCIE slot for other devices.Other than that, this motherboard is beautiful.",
