The Crucial T700 PCIe 5.0 NVMe SSD offers speeds of up to 11,700MB/s sequential reads and up to 9,500MB/s sequential writes** (up to 1,350K/1400K IOPS random reads/writes**) for faster gaming, video editing, 3D rendering and heavy workload applications. Built with Micron 232-layer TLC NAND3 and featuring a premium aluminum and nickel-plated copper heatsink that dissipates heat without noisy fans or liquid cooling, the Crucial T700 Gen5 SSD is optimized for performance, takes full advantage of Microsoft DirectStorage, and is backward compatible with Gen3 and Gen4 motherboards. A non-heatsink SKU is also available for use with an integrated motherboard heatsink*. With SSD speeds nearly 2x faster than Gen4**** in your PC, you\u2019ll never look back from the Crucial T700! * Non-heatsink versions of the Crucial T700 must be installed with a motherboard or alternate heatsink to achieve optimal performance. ** Typical I/O performance as measured using CrystalDiskMark with a queue depth of 512 and write cache enabled. Windows 11 Core isolation disabled for performance measurement. Fresh out-of-box (FOB) state is assumed. For performance measurement purposes, the SSD may be restored to FOB state using the secure erase command. System variations will affect measured results. *** See Micron.com/products/nand-flash for more information. **** Compared to Crucial P5 Plus Gen4 NVMe SSD listed speed of 6,600MB/s. Actual speed may vary. ***** Some storage capacity is used for formatting and other purposes and is not available for data storage. 1GB equals 1 billion bytes. ****** Compared to Gen5 SSD performance without DirectStorage, based on internal test results with supported GPU that uses GPU decompression. ******* Compared to Crucial MX500 SATA SSD listed speed of 560MB/s.

Was unsure if it was gonna transfer heat but it did so yeah I'd say it's well built if I'm able to do that. Temps are never over 41C and transfer speeds are decent",

Be sure to pair it with a motherboard that has a PCIe 5.0 NVME slot. This is not a default feature on Intel based motherboards yet. Even when there is a PCIe 5.0 slot, this does not mean that the NVME slot is also PCIe 5.0.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased a new computer and it only came with a single 1TB SSD.. Considering I'm a massive gamer I knew immediately it was going to be an issue.. I settled on an External drive with a fair bit of memory 8 TB's and that filled my needs for a while, but I noticed that some games had stuttering and lag, which considering the specs on my system shouldn't have been happening.. RTX4090, 64 GB of ram, etc etc etc etc.. So I narrowed down the likely causes to the External HDD, so I knew I needed to remedy that situation asap..After searching around I settled on the Crucial T700,, highly rated, and reviewed.. The price is hefty but gaming isn't a cheap hobby, if you want to play like a pro, you gotta pay like a pro..The install was super easy, plug and play pretty much, the only issue arose from trying to format the drive for use.. after a half hour and numerous youtube videos I discovered that I had forgotten to name the drive, after feeling like an idiot, I had my harddrive installed and ready to roll..Download speeds have never been faster, I've always had issues with steam download times, normally stuff that my internet speeds should have done in minutes would take an hour or more, with the Crucial it's down to taking minutes again..I honestly couldn't be happier with this product.. If had another slot on my board I'd pick up another and never have to worry about uninstalling and installing games again.. Extremely happy with this purchase..",

It sits at 66c Idle. It hardly functions. and forget it if you bench mark it, it will bring this thing to its knees(First Test is the Crucial T700, Second test is the WD_BLACK SN850)This thing runs CRAZY hot even with a heat sync (82C then throttles). It gets good read rates but that's about it, It hardly comes close to the advertised 9,500MBs writes.Also RANDOM read / writes preform much worse then my over 1.5 year old GEN4 SSD. I know I was taking a risk getting it this soon, but its definitely NOT ready for prime time.Avoid this at all costs & get Gen4.This thing is another example of manufactures releasing a product that is CLEARLY not ready for even beta testing.",

                "reviewText": "Replaced an SSD that was giving me errors and acting weird after a Intel's killer network software kept randomly crashing my computer. Got some hardware testing software to confirm and wanted to replace before things got worse. I was able to clone the drive using PC cloning software to transfer my operating system, files and settings, beware for hardware cloners, they are good for connecting to your PC using USB but they might cap the space on the new drive to the same space as the old drive. Anyways windows 11 loads a little faster than my old SSD, talking more things opening a few seconds earlier and gaming is amazing on this. My old drive was an Samsung SSD with around half the speed. Files transfers seem to be a lot faster as well, I set all my draw distances and settings to max and usually no hickups with game loading. Today I played GTA 4, the game loaded in about 20-30 seconds, I'm very happy with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I have a Z790 motherboard with a 13700k. Specs say it is a PCIe4 m2 slot, but I also have a PCIe5 GPU slot.I reached out to the seller to see what speeds I could expect and they said full speed because I have a PCIe5 x16. They were wrong, so go off of your MB spec not what anyone else says. I am using the Heatsink on my MB for this and it works fine, however idle temps are around 45c and under/benchmark they went up to about 63c tops. Without the side panel on my case, Idle temps were at 50c. In comparison my old Fury renegade had idle temps around 32c and never went over 50c. Also for comparison, I included the last 2 images for the Kingston fury/renegade the Images with 7016 and 7041 speeds. The rated speed for that fury drive is 7300/6000MB/s read and write. The theoretical max speed on PCIe4 is 8000MB/s That being said, when bench marking the old drive I would get Passmark ratings between 48k and 53k. With this new drive, I always get over 56k as indicated in the red benchmarks. Also with this new drive having better performance than what my Motherboard is capable of, I am now getting a true indicator of my MB performance. Also if you notice second bench, this drive is rated at 1.5 million IOPS and I got 1.39 million. This is a very zippy drive even on PCIe4 m2. The performance difference isnt much on my specific system and this drive is over 100 dollars more. In short, lol. If you have a PCIe5 M2 slot, this is the drive to get. IMO, If you do NOT have an existing PCIe4 NVME drive with good specs then you might want to consider this drive for max speed on your system. Further, depending on your system upgrade path, you should get this drive if you are doing a new build or upgrading within the next 6 months. No matter what heat sink you use, you will need good air flow in your case to help reduce temps. I have actually reversed the air flow in my system so the rear fan blows into the case across the VRM, NVMe and the GPU, and my exhaust is out the front with my dual fan AIO.",

The second example was when I played Alan Wake 2 and every load screen was immediate, there where no periods of wait outside the first 4 seconds the game took to open up.Look into PCI 5 storage as the prices go down, its absolutely worth it!",
