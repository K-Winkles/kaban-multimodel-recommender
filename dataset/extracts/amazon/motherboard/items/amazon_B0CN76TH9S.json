This is hands down my favorite board to work with. Quick swap NVMe slots are SO nice to have!White PCB! \ud83d\ude0dThe VRMs are very well contacted under each heat sync, runs cooler than other AM5 X670 boards I've tested by a couple C\u00b0.DDR5 memory training was about twice as fast as almost all other boards tested, regardless of ram speed and timing. Absolutely zero stability issues whatsoever! That vast majority of CPUs used in most bulbs are 7800x3D & 7700x, all of which seem to boost over advertised clocks speeds at factory settings on this board.This motherboard is absolutely great!!I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a solid board, especially for white build!",
