During the process I called ASUS support and I wasn't able to get the tech to understand the problems completely and he wanted me to contact AMD about a boot kit. I just downloaded the new BIOS on my old computer and put on an USB drive to install the BIOS. Things continue to work fine over a month later.",

                "reviewText": "I've been a loyal ASUS customer since 1989 or so when I built my first PC when Intel came out with it's 386 processor. I've built perhaps a dozen or more computers for myself using nothing but ASUS motherboards and AMD processors ever since! I've built and and maintained 25 or more for friends and family as well, all ASUS and AMD. None have ever failed! About 15 years ago, I got my first ASUS laptop, and upgraded with ASUS laptops twice. I've put a couple of friends into ASUS laptops, too!I'm not a gamer, or enamored by flashing lights, etc. So I didn't need a higher-end motherboard when I decided to upgrade my AMD FX-8370/ASUS M5A99FX Pro R2.0 to an AMD Ryzen 3800X with its 8 processor/16 thread capability. So, after looking at the choices, I decided on Prime B550M-K motherboard.While unboxing it, the first thing I noticed was how the instruction book for the motherboard got a LOT thinner than ALL the other motherboards I've ever installed. Usually, they've been about 100 pages and describe in detail 'all the usual' stuff and then describe each BIOS setting as well. This one is 20 pages! No BIOS setting detail, no RAM compatibility charts, etc. The same thing is downloaded from ASUS as well. I guess they've decided that most computer builders aren't rookies any more and save some paper cost.Other cost savings were accomplished as follows:1. Only 2 instead of 4 SATA cables2. Only 4 SATA ports instead of 63. The Q-connector to simplify connecting all the front panel button & LED connectors is no more.4. The CPU_Opt fan connector is omitted (where AIO pump would be connected)5. Only 2 instead of 3 Chassis fan connectors.Although I don't consider myself a 'high end' user, as this motherboard is designed to handle the full range of AMD Ryzen processors, one would think there would be additional SATA and fan connections. Perhaps this mobo is intended for commercial builders with customers that barely know how to turn on their computers.In all, I'm satisfied with the motherboard. It does what I need and I only had to supply an extra SATA card and SATA cables to handle my 6 SATA devices.",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Blatant False Advertising",
                "reviewText": "I rarely ever even consider writing reviews as I\u2019m typically a firm believer in the product itself making or breaking the company on its own. However, I feel compelled to share my experience to hopefully help others if at all possible.I purchased this motherboard for a job/custom build request for a client. The day I visited this page to place my order (in search of a compact mtx MB to work with an AMD 5000 series CPU) NOWHERE on the page did it state that it was a coin toss as to whether or not I\u2019d receive a MB with the correct BIOS update to accommodate said CPU. On the contrary, it was painted all over this page that it would be compatible straight out of the box\u2026. Oh, and if you need to update that BIOS, you can just use FLASHBACK which is advertised here as well\u2026only this MB doesn\u2019t have FLASHBACK! Lol.I\u2019m sure at this point you already understand where these leads to\u2026. I wound up with a very upset client when I had to call and let them know the job wouldn\u2019t be completed on time because I was blatantly lied to by this company. Would you like to know what they\u2019re solution is? Here\u2019s what they are advising customers like me (that fell into this trap) to do\u2026 Just use a \u201ccompatible\u201d CPU to update the BIOS and then install the one you actually wanted that is advertised as being compatible\u2026. I honestly feel second hand embarrassment on behalf of the representatives that have the job of relaying this kind of useless information. The company obviously couldn\u2019t care less about the customers nor their employees if this is what they\u2019re trained to say.Anyway, once I realized the pickle I was in with my reputation and livelihood on the line, I immediately grabbed as many screenshots as possible and headed over to the sweet sweet realm of Amazon\u2019s \u201cCustomer Support\u201d\u2026. I provided this slew of documentation and detailed breakdown to the first \u201crepresentative\u201d. They couldn\u2019t help me and had to pass me off to the next. This circus sideshow went on FAR longer than it ever should have. I was simply looking to work with Amazon for a solution to this pressing and negligent cacophony of a mess. I could not wrap my head around the amount of time wasted and number of people I spoke with that either could not care less, were extremely rude or obviously had no idea what I was talking about\u2026 I finally spoke with a \u201csupervisor\u201d who told me I was responsible for rectifying the entire situation and they would not send any assistance until they received my return! Oh, Amazon\u2026 Do you not own enough of the world already? You need to receive my return for an item around $100 before you can help me? Is that even help? Do you even believe I deserved to be helped? Haha.Moving on\u2026 Made sure to grab all of the screenshots of everything from customer support with names and rank for my own sanity because I could barely comprehend the whirlwind of nonsense I had endured through the whole ordeal.I ended up having to order a more expensive CPU that actually WAS compatible based on this silly chart ASUS has going on where you can compare the serial on the MB you have to CPU\u2019s that are ACTUALLY proven to work with the unit. I\u2019ve never been so excited to return items in my entire life\u2026. I used to stand by ASUS pretty much exclusively and it saddens me that it had to come to an end. It also saddens me to know that I can no longer rely on Amazon\u2019s old ways of delivering great customer service (especially when the onus is on you, not me\u2026) Sticking with MicroCenter here on out where I know I can walk in, be greeted by actual human beings who love technology and WANT to help me.To tie all of this up in a nice tidy bow, I was advised to reach out to the seller to see if they would be interested in trying to solve this issue. Supposedly they have so many days to reply. Sent them a chunk of screenshots, explained the situation for the hundredth time and lo and behold\u2026I received no reply lol. I actually received an automated message from Amazon inquiring about how my experience went with messaging the seller to which I happily informed them I never heard back\u2026 And no reply from Amazon either.Everyone on that end dropped the ball so egregiously, with zero accountability, zero transparency and zero respect. If anyone out there is interested in actually speaking with me about the issue and not just sweeping me under the rug, I\u2019ll be here. I have all of the documentation on a thumb drive ready to rock.To make a long story short, do yourself a HUGE favor and just look elsewhere. Avoid the headache. Avoid the stress/high blood pressure lol. Ain\u2019t worth it!This could\u2019ve gone a million different ways and this is how you\u2019ve all decided it should go for me. That\u2019s just hurtful. I also see that cool little colorful banner is still on the page as of today stating the entire series has the ability to run a FLASHBACK. There is a new little addendum stating that WE are responsible for ensuring our parts are compatible before purchasing. Isn\u2019t that sweet?\u2026 Still extremely vague, predatory and very misleading if you read through the entire listing.Well, I\u2019m off to eat some Tums and try to forget about all of this now haha. DONT BUY THIS MB. Peace out!",

Which isn\u2019t a big deal for most boards, as you can just use the manual bios flash button and a flash drive to fix it, but there\u2019s no such button on this board. Wasted money I will probably never get back as I stretched building my computer over about 6-8 months to afford some higher quality parts, and it just bit me.
