                "reviewText": "Although I did not buy it from here on Amazon. I've been patiently waiting for this board as I had spare 32GB set of laptop ram, wifi card and M.2 NVME laying around. Just had to pick up a CPU and I went with an i5 12400 for this setup. After receiving this board I had installed all the components inside a nice small case. Since I had an Dell Alienware laptop, I figured that the power supply would just fit in there. However I was surely mistaken. So after a few attempts, I finally figured what type of power supply was require as the manual only states a 19v DC power supply.So to save you guys some time in searching for a power supply. You will need a 5.5mm barrel connector power supply. Just search Asus Rog Laptop Charger, 19.5V 9.23A 180W Asus Power Adapter and this will work perfectly for this mobo. Originally I used a Dell 7.5mm barrel connector and that didn't work. Was so frustrated that I then I bought a 4.5mm barrel connector style power supply and still did not work. Had I known this info prior then it would had saved me a lot of time. Just order the Asus power supply and save yourself the headache. Hopefully this will help someone.Overall I love the layout of the board. With the most current 12th Gen Intel chip and Intel AX201 wifi it is hard to beat. Do not exceed 65W CPU though.",
