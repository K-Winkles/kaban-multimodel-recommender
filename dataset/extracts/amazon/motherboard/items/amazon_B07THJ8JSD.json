                "reviewText": "I bought this board for a home server, so this review will mainly talk about ECC (Error Checking and Correcting) memory.The board itself works perfectly. I have Samsung DDR4-3200 ECC memory, two Samsung 980 Pro SSDs (for tiered caching in Windows Spaces), and 10 hard drives (6 of them on a Broadcom RAID controller).Much to my surprise, the BIOS doesn't suck. Almost all non-Asus boards I have used have terrible BIOS setup screens, which isn't an enormous problem because I spend maybe a few hours per year in them, but it's nice to have an interface set up by someone that has any clue about UI design. Gigabyte, I am talking to you.I would hazard to say that I think ASRock's is even better than Asus's. It uses some cool ideas such as providing a QR code to look up details of various BIOS settings, and it is at least as tweakable as any ROG Hero board I've owned. Nice work, ASRock!The reason I ordered this board, however, is its full ECC support.ECC is a memory technology that detects and fixes memory errors. Many random crashes and other unexplained behavior are likely caused by these errors, and because crashes are unacceptable from a server, they use memory that prevents the problem.Most boards are happy to use ECC modules, they just don't use the ECC feature. The ASRock BIOS has no ECC menu and makes absolutely zero mention of ECC. So how do I know it works?In Windows, enter this command in PowerShell or cmd:wmic memphysical get memoryerrorcorrectionYou will get an output that looks like this:MemoryErrorCorrection6That number, 6 means, that my board supports not only single-bit error checking and correction, but also multi-bit. The complete list of numbers you might see follows:0 Reserved1 Other2 Unknown3 None4 Parity5 Single-bit ECC6 Multi-bit ECC (The good stuff!)7 CRCWith 8 SATA ports and two m.2 ports, this board is a great setup for a home server. I use Windows Server with Storage Spaces, which is similar in capability to ZFS using TrueNAS/FreeNAS except that it doesn't have the fragmentation issues or ludicrous memory recommendations, and it's much easier to use.You can also use Linux's very capable mdadm to set up software RAID, or use the motherboard's built-in RAID (which is also software RAID, just with lipstick).",

                "reviewText": "The package arrived on time and well-packaged, externally. Once I opened the box, I was disappointed, and prepared myself for further disappointment. The original packaging had bee opened, before. When I unpacked it, I found there was NO I/O face plate, NO mounting screws, almost everything that one would expect to find in a brand new motherboard package was gone. All it contained was a manual (had been handled, before), a couple of mounts, a couple of screws, and SATA cables. The anti-static bag was wide open. Piss poor packaging. I was anticipating board failure of SOME kind, but decided to go through with the re-build, just on the off-chance that this was returned by someone too dumb or too lazy to properly utilize it.I'm glad I did... I was formerly a die-hard ASUS customer. Recently, due to a dramatic drop in both quality and customer service, I decided to go ASRock. and I'm happy with that choice. Start to finish, this was a breeze, and the new build is performing VERY well. Linux Mint (21) was installed in under 45 minutes, start to finish (including updates). None of the issues I experienced with ASUS popped up, and this is how a rebuild is SUPPOSED to go. My only complaint with this was my own oversight... no wifi/BT. It has the M.2 slot for an AIO card, and that was remedied for %30. For the price, the board is outstanding. We'll see how long this lasts but, at present, this is firing on all cylinders, and it truly ROCKS. Full reboot is under 15 seconds (gen4 nVME, Ryzen 5800X 3rd gen Proc, and128 GB Corsair RAM). I will update, should any circumstances change but, at present, I can actually recommend this board for the builder on a budget.",

                "reviewText": "I have built quite a few PCs over the years. This one gave me the most headaches in a very long time. First thing to know is that out of the box POST takes forever. Mine would also not POST with two 32GB memory modules installed at first, but with one module it passed the memory POST stage.Also, with a 5600G APU installed there is no picture from the built in HDMI nor Display Port. To get that done the setting in the BIOS prioritizing the discrete graphics card has to be set to prioritizing the integrated graphics instead. To do that a discrete graphics card has to be installed, which is somewhat defeating the purpose if you are building a headless NAS using the Radeon built into the APU.Once the BIOS was set up correctly and updated I removed the discrete GPU and added the second memory stick, and the board came up normally. The board works fine, and for the price ($125 for an x570 board) is worth fiddling with it, but beginners should look elsewhere, there are lots of boards which are easier to deal with.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:- Unraid 6.9.2 reports my 32GB NEMIX RAM kit as supporting Multi-bit ECC.- Appears to be rock solid, 13 days uptime at time of writing- RGB can be disabled.- 8 rear facing SATA ports for tons of storage before needing to resort to buying a HBA card.Cons:- Board was bowed on each corner. I would attribute this to ASRock's decision to ziptie the board at the corners to a foam carrier. My board survived shipping overseas with no additional overbox, but I could see how a warped board could lead to DOAs.Neutral:- The UEFI is probably the most sparse UEFI I've ever encountered. It doesn't hold a candle to the UEFI in my primary builds old Asus X99a and new Asus Crosshair VIII Dark Hero. With that being said, the Steel Legend does have the necessities for overclocking/peripheral control and this is a value focused board to begin with.

                "reviewText": "Senza dubbio un\u2019ottima scheda madre ma andiamo con ordine. Provengo da una b450 sempre steel legend, il salto di innovazione da quella a questa \u00e8 alto ma con delle pecche: in primis mancano i led di segnalazione guasti ram, cpu, ecc, che posso capire su una mobo di fascia bassa, ma questa non lo \u00e8. Non dico che deve avere il display come la extreme ma almeno 4 led potevano metterceli. Lato bios c\u2019\u00e8 stato un notevole balzo in avanti, \u00e8 molto meglio organizzato rispetto alla b450 ma la sezione overclock non \u00e8 ottimizzata. Per il resto ottima mobo, dissipatori nvme e vrm massicci, ventola di raffreddamento del chipset inudibile praticamente, illuminazione rgb fatta davvero bene, pcb massiccio, di qualit\u00e0. Supporta alla perfezione Windows 11, io l\u2019ho abbinata a un ryzen 7 5800x overcloccato, stabilit\u00e0 del sistema e prestazioni incredibili. Se cercate una mobo stabile, ottimizzata per il pci e 4.0 e esteticamente gradevole questa \u00e8 la scelta giusta. Unico appunto: l\u2019app di default che gestisce i led lasciatela perdere perch\u00e8 \u00e8 pi\u00f9 le volte che non va che quelle che va (fatta con i piedi proprio), meglio gestire i led dal bios, meno grattacapi.",
