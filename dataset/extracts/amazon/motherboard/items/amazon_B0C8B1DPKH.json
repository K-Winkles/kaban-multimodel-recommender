It will not find it. That is the first flaw. The bios has way too many options. And I am running my Samsung Evo 870 1 TB 2.5\" SSD as my main drive. 650w PSU. LG 4k monitor. N3XT case.This mother board crashes all the time. I heard it word. I thought it wouldn't. I have to now find a different bios. That is the only fix. It feels sluggish, slow, my ram is not running to the full potential. But the crashing is the biggest issue. I am not even running a heavy demanding game. Unreal Tournament 2004 is my go to right now. 200 FPS. But right in the middle of the game it will crash, and it is violent. It sends a loud ear splitting screech through your head phones when it crashes. And you have to manually restart your computer every time. BUT IT CAN JUST BE SITTING ON THE DESKTOP AS WELL AND IT WILL JUST FREEZE.Once I am caught up on bills I am going to get a different board. This one is JUNK.",

                "reviewText": "I bench tested this machine against the motherboard on my son\u2019s machine from Best-Buy and it stomped it with better speed. With this motherboard my son says he turns the settings and resolutions all the way up on the online games now. Some of that is of course the video card etc..This board works well for me in that it was easy to setup and run with no issues. I liked its price and used it as a test board. My other motherboard died in a very strange way (LED showed no motherboard issues and no video out...but video-card was good) I really needed a \"known good\" to troubleshoot..One downside of this purchase was that the documentation was still being created. I needed the exact pins for Power/reset switches on front panel. The company was fantastic about getting me the images and text needed in a timely manner. They were great!.The second downside (for me) was that it only has four ram slots. I have tons of memory but in quantity of sticks so would have to use it elsewhere. If you're new to building PC's this might be a great ticket for creating a game machine..Given all the hacking from Russia and China, I hope someone verifies the board doesn\u2019t call any mothership when its on your network. Just saying we live in those times.",

Not only did the first pciex slot still did not work either, but none of the nvme m.2 card got detected at all by the bios, meaning it could not boot from my perfectly fine m.2 nvme ssd...Really dissappointed with this product... I do NOT recommend this brand at all!",

In dem Karton lag nur das Mainboard sonst nichts, keine Beschreibung keine Software nichts. Auch im Netz keinerlei Support, keine Software zum Download null. Ich habe das Board zum laufen bekommen und es l\u00e4uft gut, aber ein Leie sollte die Finger davon lassen.",
