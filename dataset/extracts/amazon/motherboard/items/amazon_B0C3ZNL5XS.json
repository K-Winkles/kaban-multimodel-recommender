                "reviewText": "The ASUS PRIME B760M-A motherboard aims to provide a budget-friendly entry point for building a system powered by the latest 13th Gen Intel Core processors. But does it offer enough features and performance to warrant your hard-earned cash? Let's dissect its strengths and weaknesses:Pros:Affordable Entry Point: At a competitive price point, the PRIME B760M-A makes building a new PC with 13th Gen Intel CPUs more accessible for budget-conscious users.Solid Core Features: Supports PCIe 4.0, DDR5 memory, and 2.5Gbps LAN, ensuring compatibility with newer components and delivering decent connectivity options.Sufficient Expansion: Offers two M.2 slots for fast NVMe storage, four SATA ports for traditional drives, and various USB ports for connecting peripherals.Easy to Build With: Clear layout, intuitive design, and Q-LED indicators make the building process smoother, even for first-time builders.ASUS Quality Assurance: Backed by the reliability and reputation of the ASUS brand, offering some peace of mind for your investment.Cons:Limited Overclocking: Lacks advanced overclocking features like LLC control or voltage tuning, catering more towards users who prioritize stability over pushing the limits.VRM Concerns: While adequate for most users, the VRM configuration might not be ideal for heavily overclocking demanding CPUs.Basic Aesthetics: Doesn't boast flashy RGB lighting or premium aesthetics, appealing primarily to users who prioritize functionality over style.Missing Wi-Fi: The standard version lacks onboard Wi-Fi, requiring a separate adapter for wireless connectivity.Limited Rear USB Ports: Fewer rear USB ports than some competitors, potentially requiring USB hubs for setups with numerous peripherals.Verdict:The ASUS PRIME B760M-A is a solid choice for budget-minded builders looking for a functional and reliable motherboard to support their 13th Gen Intel CPU. Its affordability, core features, and ease of use make it a viable option for entry-level and mid-range PC builds. However, limited overclocking potential, basic aesthetics, and the lack of built-in Wi-Fi might deter users seeking higher performance or aesthetic flair.Overall Rating: 4 out of 5 stars (with a slight deduction for missing features and overclocking limitations)Should You Buy It?Yes! If you're on a tight budget, prioritizing functionality over fancy features, and building a system with a mid-range 13th Gen Intel CPU, the PRIME B760M-A is a smart choice.Consider alternatives: If you plan on heavy overclocking, crave sleek aesthetics, need built-in Wi-Fi, or require more USB ports, explore motherboards with more advanced features or consider models with Wi-Fi included.",

                "reviewText": "It all started so well. The booklet was minimal but I did like the QR codes which downloaded useful info, which was much better than my recent Gigabyte purchase which usually said go to their website. Fitting the cpu (I5 13500) was easy as was the cooler supplied with the cpu. The problem was the fact that it flashed the power button 4 times a second when powered on. This indicates no cpu or no memory. I had tried 3 cpu's and two lots of DDR5 memory and an M2 drive which all work in my recent Gigabyte MB. I also tried 3 power supplies to make sure. I haven't decided yet whether to try another of these or go for a gigabyte again. If the former and it works I will update this review.EDIT.... ASUS UK do the same board but with Wi-Fi, however it states that at that price it may not be the same specification. I found it impossible to find out if it would work with the cpu, memory and M2 drive that i have so I've ordered another Gigabyte MB.BTW as it's being returned internationally (USA) i had to print another three loose copies of the Commercial Invoice which meant two trips to send it away. So I've knocked it down to 1 star.",
