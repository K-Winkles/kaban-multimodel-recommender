                "reviewText": "I recently upgraded to the Micro Center AMD Ryzen 7 7700X bundle with the GIGABYTE B650M DS3H motherboard, and I'm blown away by the quality and performance. The Ryzen 7 7700X, being a current-gen processor, offers a massive performance leap over my old i7 8700k. The 8 cores and 16 threads handle everything I throw at it with ease, making it perfect for both gaming and multitasking.The GIGABYTE B650M DS3H motherboard is a great match for the 7700X. Its build quality is solid, and the features like DDR5 support, PCIe 4.0, and USB 3.2 Gen2X2 Type-C port are future-proof. The 2.5GbE LAN is a nice touch for faster internet connectivity.Speaking of gaming, this setup runs Star Citizen at an average of 70 fps when paired with my 4070 GPU, which is impressive. The smoothness and responsiveness in game are remarkable. It's a huge upgrade from my previous experience with the i7 8700k, where I struggled to get consistent frame rates in such demanding titles.For anyone looking to significantly upgrade their gaming rig, especially coming from older setups like the i7 8700k, I highly recommend this bundle. The Ryzen 7 7700X and GIGABYTE B650M DS3H motherboard combination offers exceptional performance and value, making it a top choice for gamers and power users alike.",

                "reviewText": "Mini ATX, so smaller than most boards and can fit in a smaller case. I have revision 1.5 which is the latest revision. This will run Ryzen 5000 series, Windows 10 and 11, and it is compatable with TPM2.0 and Secure Boot. It also is capable of running up to 128 GB of DDR-4 3200 RAM! Impressive! I had no problems setting it up with the Ryzen 3600 it came with. I also bought 16GB of Corsair Vengeance LPX which ran perfectly. I also was able to buy a Crucial P3 500GB PCIe Gen3 3D NAND NVMe M.2 SSD which the Win11 o/s went onto. All this for just over $300 with shipping! It has the slightly older 802.11AC Wi-Fi & BT 4.2 which was working once Windows was installed. From there I was able to update windows, download the Gigabyte app center with which I downloaded all the drivers for the chipset, audio, etc. I might point out these drivers were all Microsoft certified and recent! It did not come with a manual but there is a pdf manual on the Gigabyte motherboard support page downloads that was a big help.Great board for those starting a low budget build.",
