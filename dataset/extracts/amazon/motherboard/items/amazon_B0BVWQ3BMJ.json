                "reviewText": "Recently bought the GIGABYTE B760I AORUS PRO motherboard and after a few weeks of testing here is the review:Compact Yet Mighty (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605):This little MOBO surprised me. The B760I AORUS PRO is designed to be small, i am using this in a NZXT H1 and cannot reccomend it enough for a mini itx build! It is so feature rich and fits neatly into compact builds without sacrificing any performance. PCIE gen 4 for your NVME drives Im getting 3.7gb disk usage in steam downloads - 2 NVME slots and DDR5 RAM slots are a must, definitely worth getting the pro and splashing on some DDR5 6000mhz RAM.User-Friendly BIOS (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605):The BIOS on this thing is surprisingly user-friendly. Even if you're not a tech genius, tweaking settings is straightforward. GIGABYTE made it easy for anyone to change basic settings like Resizable BAR and XMP in the bios.AURA Sync Magic (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606):If youre in the AURA ecosystem of RGB devices then this is a nice touch but i find the gigabyte control center to be lacking - may just be because its my only gigabyte componentCool and Calm (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606):I like the inbuilt temperature monitoring but there isnt much to tweak outside of the bios.Connectivity Check (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606):For a compact board, it's got a decent set of ports. From USB slots to HDMI, it covers the essentials. No major complaints here \u2013 everything I needed was right at my fingertips - dont forget the wifi antenna too if youre not going ethernet - although I highly recommend taking advantage of the 2.5gbe port.To sum it up, the GIGABYTE B760I AORUS PRO is a solid choice for those who want a powerful feature rich motherboard in a mini itx formfactor. It's not perfect, but for a hassle-free build with some extra flair, this little guy gets a thumbs up from me. If you're into compact and capable, give it a thought!",

                "reviewText": "This is much better than a B660 ITX DDR5 board I recently installed from a company whose name rhymes with MASUS. The pictures are confusing but this baord actually accomodates 1 NVME on the front and one on the back. Both are outfitted with impressive heatsinks that do a fantastic job of keeping the NVMEs cool. On the other board I had, I had to buy a custom heatsink to keep NVME temps down as their heatsink was inadequate. Also for my 2nd drive on that board I had to buy a heatsink too. Gigabyte includes a huge backplate as a heatsink for the 2nd NVME on this board.First thing I did was go into bios and update bios to latest version from usb drive.Like other ITX boards, when you install Windows it will not find wifi drivers. For me the easiest way to solve this was to copy the drivers onto a USB using another computer and then at the OOBE screen press CTRL+SHIFT+F3 to reboot into Audit mode. This boots into the built in administrator mode and allows you to install drivers. Once I got the wifi driver on, I rebooted back into OOBE mode using the Sysprep tool. Everything I am describing you can easily find more detailed instructions for by googling the terms I am using.After that, installed all the drivers from gigabyte website and everything perfect in device manager.I am using this in an NR200 case with 13400 and Deepcool heatsink for CPU. I have an NVidia 1650 installed mainly using it for work. Ran some games on it, no temperareture issues at all. I am not installing the gigabyte control center as I have seen poor reviews of it.I am super happy with this hardware so far. This computer is a champ for medical imaging work.",

                "reviewText": "It's a nice board, does almost everything I need. This board does support ddr5, there some conflicting info on the listing and website, but there's a ddr4 version and ddr5.It's mITX, if you're not going to include a error display because of form factor, ok I get it. However you should probably include a speaker. At the very least you should make the leds included on the board function as some kind of error reporting, rather than just pretty rainbow colors as my pc hangs on boot.I spent 3 hours tearing apart and testing a sff pc, only to discover 1 ram stick could no longer boot under xmp. If I had any kind of error reporting it wouldn't have taken me an entire night to solve.Also w11 now almost completely disables install without internet, so it was an adventure getting it installed. I couldn't install network (wifi AND lan) drivers because w11 was insisting I connect to a network before allowing me to install drivers?Mobo manufacturers and Microsoft need to figure that out, shouldn't take 5 hours to figure out how to install windows.",
