                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Hardware with Exceptional Support",
                "reviewText": "The Gigabyte B550I Aorus Pro AX is one of the most affordable B550 ITX motherboards on the market at the time of this review, yet it is also extremely solid with all the latest features that an enthusiast may want in an ITX motherboard.Pros:For myself personally, the reasons for choosing this motherboard or a B550 board in general, is to have better/sooner support for the Ryzen 5000 series, along with things like PCIe 4.0, USB 3.2, and 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet. This board also features a very handy Q-Flash feature for flashing the BIOS without having anything aside from a power supply and a USB stick, so no need to worry about having a Ryzen 3000 series chip on-hand to flash the latest BIOS. The board also features a backplate that really makes it feel like a properly premium and sturdy product. Compared to its X570 sibling, this board is around $30 less expensive but does not lack anything notable in my opinion, aside from the M.2 slot on the back of the board being PCIe 3.0 whereas the X570 version has PCIe 4.0 on both M.2 slots. The B550 also does not have a chipset cooling fan, which to me is an advantage over the X570 because it eliminates a potential source of noise and premature failure.It\u2019s also worth noting that the chipset fan on the X570 version takes up one of the 3 fan headers, whereas all 3 headers on this board are usable. The X570 version also appears to only have USB 3.1 Gen 2 and 1.0 Gigabit Ethernet.Cons:This board does not have any provisions for front panel USB-C ports, so beware if your case features any USB-C ports that will need to be connected to the motherboard. Officially, the B550 chipset only supports Ryzen 3000 series out of the box, with Ryzen 5000 support enabled via a BIOS update. On the other hand, the X570 version will support Ryzen 2000 series as well, so in that regard the B550 board does lack a bit of flexibility.Additional Notes:I picked up this motherboard with the intention of using it with a Ryzen 5000 series chip when I get around to buying one sometime next year. The reason for buying this board now is mainly because availability for this board has been very inconsistent until recently, so I figured it would be wise to buy one while it\u2019s readily available. I\u2019m currently using a Ryzen 2700X which isn\u2019t officially supported by the B550 chipset, so I was originally going to leave this board on the shelf until I got a Ryzen 5000 series CPU.I saw a few reports of people getting 2000 series CPUs to work in B550 boards, though they were few and far in between. However, I was going to go ahead and flash this board to BIOS version F10 to enable Ryzen 5000 support, so I thought it wouldn\u2019t hurt to check if my 2700X will post in this board while I\u2019m at it. The board was probably preloaded with the F1 or F2 BIOS out of the box, and I got nothing but a black screen when I tried to boot. However, after flashing to the F10 BIOS, I was massively surprised to see that it was able to post, and everything seemed to function normally in the BIOS. I proceeded to go a step further and installed my boot drive to see if it will boot into Windows, and I couldn\u2019t quite believe my eyes when it reached desktop without any noticeable issues, and without reinstalling Windows or any of the drivers.Fast forward to today, and I\u2019m running the F11b BIOS from October 19 with \u201cadditional optimizations\u201d for Ryzen 5000 series, which actually enabled XMP for me, something that wasn\u2019t working on the F10 BIOS. I have now reinstalled Windows and have been fine-tuning all the details without any problems whatsoever. I couldn\u2019t be any happier with this board, everything from its features and construction to the unexpected support for older chips like mine. I would also like to add that the F10 BIOS which enabled Ryzen 5000 support was released on September 18, before the Ryzen 5000 series was even announced.

                "reviewText": "I ordered a used board from Amazon, because of high pricing on many pc components lately thinking if it lasts me a year or two that would do. I received the product and it was a little beat up, but not horrible, but alas it was not working. This prompted me to return it for refund which lead me to a phrase in Amazon's return script stating how can we make this right. They are only six benign words apart but put together they had an impact on me. What Amazon offered was a cross shipment with another board which turned out to be in excellent shape, and worked first boot. So this review is more a thank you to Amazon, more than anything. Also note on the packaging there was a sticker thanking me for giving this used product a second life, which made me feel good about my purchase. As for the motherboard it's a great board, if your partial to mini ITX systems. You really don't loose much over a full ATX besides case footprint. Perfect for limited space setups.",

                "reviewText": "I know a lot of people had connectivity issues with this motherboard. The one I got was rev 1.3 and Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc. works great once you download the correct drivers. I had to install Windows in offline mode and then use a USB stick to install the Wi-Fi driver and then I was able to connect to the internet and download the rest of the drivers. You may also be able to install the drivers from a USB stick while setting up Windows, but I only had one USB stick/didn't know how to do that.Gigabyte's preloaded \"App Center\" makes it really easy to install all the most up to date drivers in a few clicks. The App Center also allows you to easily update the BIOS should you need to. Also any new board should be rev 1.3 or later and comes ryzen 5000 ready.Overall I'm happy with this motherboard.",

Plopped it in a silverstone raven with a 5600x and gigabyte 6700xt eagle.Overall it works good, the bios didnt need an update which was nice. the XMP/AMP profile was recognized and runs mushkin redline stilleto's just fine at advertised 3600mhz.AMD PBO works great, ran Ryzen Master, set oversets to +2 over everything it recommended so -28 except on top 2 cores at -25 and havent had any stability issues.Was really hoping bluetooth would just work but it doesnt. Maybe bios update might fix it, or it mess up all my other settings so I opted for a $20 asus BT dongle which works fine, just means I have to have front usb cover opened on my very sleek case.WIFI does work great though.My other minor gripe is the labeling of the front I/O pins and a lack of instructions. I wish they just provided a quick single plug solution instead of trying to seat the single connectors in very tight spaces.Overall very happy with it and its got my wife gaming from the comfort of our living room chaise.",

                "reviewText": "The goods:1. Back panel shield is integrated to the board! Handy!2. Backside (the other side that CPU and RAM mounts) has protective plate! Even better!3. RAM slot is 2 latch model. Much easier to install than ASUS B550I!4. ITX board! Yet has 2 chassis fan controllers there.Bads:1. Accessories are a bit lacking. But who installs multiple SATA drives these days? Especially on ITX builds?2. VRM Heat sinks are too thick. Be Quiet! Shadow Rock LP does not fit unless your memory module has low height. Gigabyte B450I was able to accept the cooler with VRM covering orientation. --> Some cases may have problem if you wish to install 240 AIO radiator on the top ventilation set up.3. Outer chunk of the front side M.2 SSD heat sink is not really functional. Additional thermal tape would be needed for it to be actually functional. This is very nice chunky metal piece.4. No front side USB-C type connector. Not a problem if your case do not have USB-C port anyway. But it could be a bummer for some cases.5. No dedicated PWM port for AIO cooler pump control.6. No AURA 5V RGB sync header... but this isn't an ASUS board.Remarks1. Mine came with 2022 BIOS. But Gigabyte have most recent 2023 bios on their product web site.2. Board title appears perfectly on Linux! Did not expect this!3. No WiFi/Bluetooth instability yet. Pop! OS 22.04. Kernel 6.24. One of the chassis PWM connector is rather very small JST type small pin socket rather than typical 4 pin connector. You have to use the converter cable that comes with the board.",

                "reviewText": "Note: Purchased September 2022, I received a Rev 1.1 board that fixes Bluetooth and WiFi/Ethernet issues. Make sure to use the provided antenna!Running this board in my NR200P Max, with a 5800X3D + EVGA 3090FTW, 32GB of Trident Z Neo memory. Absolutely phenomenal build quality and power delivery. PBO2 tuner and undervolting the 5800X3D gave some great performance and low temperatures.Easy to build in, the backplate is rigid and protective, plus enables great heat transfer.A small nitpick is the main M.2 slot has a heatsink and a decorative cover that goes over the heatsink, leave that off for better drive thermals. Installing the main NVMe requires you to remove a nut over the screw, not explained in the manual but Youtube was able to explain it.Othewise, over a month of heavy usage with no issues whatsoever. Great BIOS, features, build and performance. Best in class power delivery for any ITX B550 board.",
