I purchased this item as the centerpiece to my first custom built pc and could not be more pleased with the quality, aesthetics and overall functionality of the device. This item has a handy flash BIOS button which makes updating the BIOS a breeze. Visually, this motherboard is sleek and sexy, with an understated military-industrial design that is inoffensive and lacks the cringe-inducing, unnecessary text (i.e. \"gamerz unite\") found on comparable motherboards. The MSI BIOS is easy enough to use and did not present me with any problems. For the money, I'd be hard pressed to find a motherboard that's higher quality or more visually appealing. I like that this motherboard is simple, elegant and easy to understand. I had no trouble installing this hardware. The heatsinks are high quality and durable. As a first time pc builder, I couldn't have chosen a better motherboard to round out my build. I'd gladly buy another MSI motherboard for a future build in light of my experience with the Tomahawk Z790--I really can't say enough good things about this product.",

I tired to return but Amazon declines it after 30 days and they direct you to reach out to manufacturer that listed on AMAZON.com, opened up a case with MSI.com and spoke to customer service and they are telling that they cannot help and i need to reach out MSI in Netherland it was originated from there event though sold in AMAZON USA, called back Amazon to find a solution since manufacturer that they list on AMAZON,com was not help, after talking with 2 reps and supervisor name Daniel, he decided to hang up on me because there is nothing they can do, what is the point of selling a defected item if you can not assist with warranty or return, do you really expect people to ship things back to where they originated from, i purchased it in USA , not in Netherlands, i am sure they should be some law protecting people about this issues.",

Easy to work around (just install CPU power to the mobo before your top mounted AIO radiator). The only issue that I found was that sound was challenging to figure out- I was getting no sound and thought my board was defective. As it turned out, after reading about the issue with this mobo, there appears to be an issue with sound configuration. My fix was to set the default sound in the Windows device manager as \"Speakers\" and I haven't had a problem since. Much simpler solution than what I read on the chat boards. Very pleased overall.",

                "reviewText": "The reason why I bought this Motherboard was because of the amount of M.2 drive slots on it, which was important to me as I did not want to settle for external SATA drives or external SSDs. The 5 available M.2 slots leave plenty of room for upgrading to more storage in the future and will definitely last me for a decade before I decide to upgrade. I'm running a GTX 4070 and a i7 12700k processor, which this product will definitely outlive since it supports both 12th and 13th gen Intel processors. The price point on this product is honestly the best right now on the market for a motherboard with WIFI capabilities, something that is commonly overlooked nowadays. Overall, this motherboard will last me a very long time and I'm happy I have made the investment.",

                "reviewText": "Just installed this into my main rig as a replacement for my 9th gen motherboard. Paired with a 13600k, this is a great motherboard so far.Setup was annoying as wifi drivers aren\u2019t preinstalled, but this is a small issue, nothing major. They do include a usb with drivers on it. I recommend just installing the network drivers and then letting windows update do the rest. No need for MSI app or any of that.After setup, so far it\u2019s been a simple and no frills motherboard. CPU was getting hot but the bios makes it easy to undervolt. Lite load setting is on 12 by default, Intel recommends 9. This may have had something to do with my overheating.Overall I was scared to buy because of the other reviews but I\u2019m now glad I did. Last MSI board was back on 4th gen however I think I may return to buying MSI products again after this experience.",
