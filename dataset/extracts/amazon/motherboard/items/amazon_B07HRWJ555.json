                "reviewText": "It does just about everything, and it does a great job. Key things to note:The motherboard's HDMI port has no integrated graphics to power it, so it's essentially useless. You'll need to plug things into whatever graphics card you purchase.It also needs quite a bit of power -- be sure you check the number of pins available on your power supply to make sure it can power the board's overall AND CPU requirements, plus whatever else you'll be connecting.Finally, the primary SSD connector is weirdly loose. You may want to use some sort of electronic-safe putty to secure the thermal plate, otherwise it jiggles for no real apparent reason.Tech support is typical of hardware manufacturers, which is to say almost nonexistent and requires making an account with Gigabyte to access at all. No surprises there.",

There is no Wifi with this board, I would reccomend getting a PCIE Wifi card or a Wifi USB stickI should see no issues with this. Its a great value for the money, if you wanted a comparable board from ASUS it would cost more.My biggest downfall with this product is installing the RGB software. There isnt as much in terms of lighting effects but it matches my ICUE profiles with a little bit of tinkering",

The Prime board failed to enter the EFI bios after a while, and I didn\u2019t want to wait on a replacement chip even though I have equipment and qualifications to solder one on. Shouldn\u2019t have happened. This Gigabyte board is not only prettier as far as lighting and customization, but also the EFI bios has always been accessible and it hasn\u2019t failed. The Prime had HDMI and DP for CPU graphics output, but this board only has HDMI (I know probably very few people actually want to run their dual displays on CPU graphics, but that\u2019s what happens when you want to GPU mine). Overall I like this board. A lot.",

                "reviewText": "This motherboard has got to be one of the best motherboards that I've ever seen, and especially for the price!! when I first got it, it looked so cool and there was not one bit of damage to the board or the box or anything after inspecting it really closely. Installing it was a breeze, and really easy compared to other motherboards that I'm after working with in the past. And last but not least it looks SO amazing when in use and even when it was in the box!! The only bad thing about it is that the gigabyte RGB fusion 2.0 software was really broken, but after some waiting it finally all loaded and I was able to change the color on it to blue to match my blue led strip and it looks so mint!!!But on my final note, highly recommended for anyone looking for a good bang for the buck option for their motherboard, and I also wanna do a small shout out to gigabyte for making it so perfect in looks, performance, and capability. Rock on guys, I hope that you all keep up the good work!!",
