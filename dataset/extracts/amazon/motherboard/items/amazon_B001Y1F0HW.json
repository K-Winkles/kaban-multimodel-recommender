Unfortunately, it only supports basic signaling over a standard serial connection.Sadly, the motherboard didn't offer a serial port on the back (I don't think any do these days) but it did have a db9 serial header on the motherboard. This connector solved my problem, allowing me to easily connect the internal db9 serial header to an external db9 serial port, allowing me to connect my UPS so that I could automate power-off situation handling on my desktop.I'm very happy that I was able to get this part to solve my particular need. I imagine that this is more of a niche part these days but I was very happy to find it!",

Should install in just about any motherboard/case combination.ATTN newbies: always power off your system before installing a PCI or other internal card. This ain't USB.Also, find or download your MB/system user's manual and get familiar with the BIOS setup. There's nothing hard about the physical installation of devices like this -- unless space is a problem -- but they do _not_ \"just work,\" the motherboard has to \"turn them on\" at boot time and then tell the operating system (1) they exist and (2) how to communicate with them.",

Most cables are pretty short; this was the longest one I could find as a ready-to-use item. It is just long enough to span the distance in a semi-tidy routing. I would rather it were a few inches longer, but the main thing was to connect some \"legacy\" radio gear with having to source the individual parts. So this part worked fine to get that task done.",
