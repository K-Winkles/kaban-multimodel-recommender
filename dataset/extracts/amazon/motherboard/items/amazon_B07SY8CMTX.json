                "reviewText": "Update! ASRock has released new BIOS to support Ryzen 5000 series CPUs!First things first you do not want to buy this board unless you need the built in WiFi you want to buy the ASRock B450M Pro-4 or the PRO-4 F, the first is the more \"complete\" board, it comes with more fan connectors basically and the F comes with less connectors for fans.Apart from that it's an excellent budget option for Ryzen.Now to the review.This is a great board for starting off from, it comes with all you need for a system with some decent specs, the power delivery is good enough for an overclocked 8 core ryzen and the ram compatibility and overclocking is very good actually.The BIOS is very simple to understand and looks very sharp, the main difference between this board and the other PRO-4 models besides the WiFi is that it only come with two PCIe slots 1 16x and 1 8x compared to 1 16x, 1 8x and 1 4x and this has the same number of fan connector as the PRO-4 F (3)",

                "reviewText": "I got this from Amazon warehouse. It looked brand new, and even though they said the packaging was opened everything was there. It's a good budget motherboard. It works fine for me with a Ryzen 5 3600, GTX 1660 Super, and PNY Anarchy-X 16gb (2x8 gb) DDR4-3200 ram. The ram runs at 3200 mhz with xmp turned on without a problem. With precision boost overdrive, I think that's what it's called, the cpu runs up to the rated boost clock regularly when gaming.My only complaint so far is the lack of fan headers. I know it's a budget board, but an extra 4-pin fan header or two would be nice. This board only has two 4-pin fan headers, one for the cpu fan and one chassis fan. There is another 3-pin fan header, but my fans only ran at full speed when attached to that. I could not change the fan speed with either the bios or Asrock's fan control program when using the 3-pin header. Thankfully, my fans were low enough draw that I could daisy chain five pwm fans off the one 4-pin case fan header. That was my only issue, as the fans were way too loud when running wide open.",
