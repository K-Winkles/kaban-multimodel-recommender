The drive that was in there previously had been untouched since I got the unit... and had fused itself to the cable...The drive's connectors were fine, but I was in a pinch and needed a new connector ASAP to get my server back up. Other vendors make these and sell from the USA (with huge import fees and shipping), and I've also had stuff come in from said vendors that were damaged/crushed/defective. This Silverstone cable was way less money, a little bit longer than the OEM cable, and took up less space. Also qualified for Prime shipping.It came in, I slapped my little NUC back together and hallelujah: she works! Once more: the SATA connection is way less stiff/loose which means swapping the disks shouldn't crack the connectors in the future. In addition the extra length is very very very good, means I can open the unit and move the SATA drive aside while I install parts.Overall if you need a spare NUC cable, look no further. I hope Silverstone keeps investing in NUC and BRIX related equipment as it is a field with few competitors.",
