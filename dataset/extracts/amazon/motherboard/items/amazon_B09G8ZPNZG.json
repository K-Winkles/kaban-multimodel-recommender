                "reviewText": "I was a very early adopter of the AM4 platform, with one of the first X370 boards on the market and a R51600. That board treated me damn well since then, seeing the 3600, and a 5800X. Going from 2666Mhz, to 3600Mhz RAM, and from the now quaint GTX 1070 to an Rx 6800. Given my previous board was getting up ion age, I wanted to swap it out to take full advantage of the chipset features since then as this rig will need to last me another few years at least.The installation was the same as any other board, the Ports are logically laid out, and fit the same footprint of the last ASRock board I had. Everything booted and posted the first time.The win11 install that I would have sworn I'd need to refresh/re-install from my X370 board just accepted the upgrade (Though did invalidate my License.) The latest chipset drivers, a few random drivers for peripherals here and there and I was up and running.Shipped through Amazon, I got a board with the v 2.20 BIOS, about a year old, but didn't prevent me from booting a 5000 series CPU. Install to the latest went without issue.PBO, RAM timings/speed, and everything else seems to just work better with this system. I went from a 4.7 all core clock on air, to a 4.9 all core clock (PBO -20 to -28, max temp hovering about 85), My RAM Glady accepted XMP timings while previously I needed to do some tinkering, Once I'm done establishing a stable baseline for the CPU OC, I will start tightening the timings on the RAM, but I expect that I'll see better performance overall.Benchmarks like Cinebench r23 and 3D mark saw nice bumps, nothing earth shattering, but a nice bump overall.I'm not sure I'd recommend the path I took, but for me it was worth it. Will continue to buy ASRock products.",
