                "reviewText": "I know there were some reviews that tried to downplay this board and state that it was over price but there is some aspects that people need to really consider. First this is a strong motherboard option for the simple fact that you have upwards of a u s b options. Most boards that are in the 650V range come with 6 to 7. There is also three additional NVME ports aside from the single 5.0x. The board doesn't need \"heatsinks\" because the frame of the design is the cooling mechanism, the covers are also magnetic making removal very easy and protects the panels. Supports wifi and BT. It's prices exactly the same as is competition 650E boards from the OEM Taichi. It supports expo and pcie 5.0. Locking USB C port also. Fired up my 32 FURY sticks @ 6000, no problem, no heat issues with 7 series CPU either. I'm really unsure how anybody can snub this board below 4 stars. Are their cheaper options? Yes, what about from AsRock, yes.... because most other 650's in range aren't extreme, have less I/O options like USB ports and riddles with issues. I've yet to see a single complaint eliminate this board from being purchased. Hence why I own it. I don't think the often compared B650A -F or E -F from Asus blows it out the water...because you get less features, and the other boards aren't nearly as good looking. Your paying for a name and not features. Lastly, did I mention the leg-up on NZXT's CAM software compatibility since I own a Kraken?",

Connectivity is fantastic, it stays cool, runs great, no crashes or issues with a 3090 GPU and 128GB ram. It has a super clean look; I would highly recommend this board!",

I am sure that the motherboard was compatible with the rest of my PC and installed correctly. Although, it was very nice in appearance as I have an all white build, there is an issue with the motherboard and I unfortunately am sending this back to get a refund. I wouldn't purchase this brand again and will stick with ROG in the future as everything I have purchased from them is reliable.",
