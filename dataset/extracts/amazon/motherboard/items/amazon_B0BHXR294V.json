But I didn't want to settle for middle-of-the road quality either. This board has performed perfectly over the few months I have had it thus far. The BIOS documentation is virtually non-existent in hard copy which worried me but once you get into BIOS and highlight a function everything you need to know gets displayed. It really made it easy to set everything the way I needed and wanted it to be. Not to beat a dead horse here -- I am not an overclocker and cannot speak to that aspect of this board. But if you are looking for a top-line motherboard for general use I can't see how you can do better than this board.",

I even go out of my way to do everything possible to keep from writing bad reviews but here I am.Let me preface this with my specs:1300w GAMEMAX Power SupplyIntel i9 13900KF (with Nocturna NH-D15 cooler, dual fans)This useless motherboard.ZOTAC Gaming 4090 Trinity OC32GB 6000mhz CORSAIR VEGENCEThis board, especially at it's pricepoint, is nothing short of useless.USB 3/3.2 fails after every reboot. Overclocking (even after updating the BIOS) fails at the simplest level of overclocking (That's with changing PMIC to individual DIMMS, altering voltage from 1.10 through 1.32) and using Intel Xtreme Intune and manual CPU overclocking. None of it works, at all. Any.What really made me write the review was the lack of proper USB support (can someone say Windows 95b?) . I mean each bus fails at Randomly after EVERY reboot and at RANDOM during usage. Watching TV? Wireless headset magically goes out. Playing a game? Mouse stops working. Using Discord to just chat? Mic stops working.This is after a fresh install of Not Only Windows 10 but Windows 11 as well. I would also consider that this a specific motherboard malfunction. With multilayered boards, of course circuits and buses can be damaged but this isn't that. It simply just stops working, you unplug it (random device) and plug it back in? It works again? That's not a bus issue, that's a darn IO issue.Save 200 dollars and get a board that actually works. This was rushed with little or possibly no QA testing.",

Problem with procesor socket lock. This model of motherboard has problem with socket lock where you must put the new processor. 4 on 10 motherboard ASUS Z790 has same problem. Of course this is not seller foult but producer(ASUS). 3. Problem with Windows stability after instalation. Unacceptable. 4. Problem with start your PC from buttom on case(because problem with LGA1700 socket in this motherboard). I install my windows 11 pro on new Samsung M2 disc. Twice. And after one week everyday blue screen on my monitor. All my drivers for windows, graphic card, bios was fresh. Mobo is unstabile. For near 470 pounds price is unacceptable. Return back with RAM.
