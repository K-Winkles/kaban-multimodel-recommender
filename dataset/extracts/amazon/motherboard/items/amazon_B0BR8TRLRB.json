                "reviewText": "This mobo was perfect for my first custom build. I had been debating wether or not to use a full ATX or a M-ATX for my mid tower build, and after much consideration I chose this one as it was probably the best value for money DDR4 LGA-1700, quality motherboard available. The build quality is amazing, and the added extras are pretty nice too. It comes with quite a nice Wifi-6 antenna wich seems to be pretty good. I won't end up using it as I will be plugging my rig directly into Fiber ethernet, but it is a great option if you are a gamer.One note though, the VRM and choke heatsinks are quite large so if you have a clip-on type CPU cooler, you will have a hard time installing it. It would be better to go for a screw on type.Overall a great mobo!",

                "reviewText": "Guessing the shipping slowness was from Amazon waiting on ASUS, but just glad it arrived with plenty of time to build for a young lady's Xmas. Ddr4 support for 4000mhz ram with XMP in BIOS and turning off rgb when the PC is off are just a couple of the simple things that make it nice. The kiddos love the lighting so having support for that on the board is good. Slapped a 12400f in and, easy to see from the pics, an anti-bend bracket. Runs nice and cool with an aftermarket cooler on it. 3tb for now through both nvme slots until his kiddo wants/needs more space as she's getting into digital creations. Handles the 3060 ti nicely as well. If I can remember, I'll get a pic of the completed build later to add to the review.I thought about going amd but we already had this CPU lying around so the black Friday deal on this was good enough to grab it. Good Wi-Fi and Bluetooth as well, definitely needs the strong Wi-Fi as she's the furthest from the router. Until I run ethernet wiring through the home.",

                "reviewText": "I've built several PCs throughout the years and I couldn't figure out why the TUF GAMING B760M's BIOS wouldn't boot. After checking the brand new CPU and all my cables, I realized that the onboard graphics doesn't work, because I got the BIOS screen after inserting a GPU.Now I am dealing with the BIOS not recognizing hardware to Boot and after updating the BIOS, BIOS loads directly into the EZ Flash,Furthermore, the lack of CMOS and other info in the manual is irritating. The box doesn't come with a MOBO speaker nor the traditional ASUS easy power switch pins.Normally building a PC is much easier, even with traditional ASUS MOBOs",

Im certainly an idiot for not realizing this, but considering most peeople arent entrenched in the tech world and/or would immediately realize the significance of the acronym, please ber aware. I missed out on black friday deals waiting for the return. If its cheaper, theres a reason for it. I think given the already extended nature of the title for the product, that spelling out \"Mini\" wouldnt be too much to ask for. Thanks :)",

                "reviewText": "While it is an outstanding board, as I would expect from Asus, the lack of screws was a little shocking. I am just use to having a decent number of screws and lifts with each new motherboard. I did have an issue that appeared to be with NVidia Experience, since the error presented itself after install, but working with the Asus Tech Support we found the issue was actually with Windows 11 and an easy solution once the debugging was done.... Disabled power options - Fast Restart to prevent the system from auto-restart after shutdown. Moving to a new motherboard always has its fair number of issues and research to be done.",
