I don't and I can't.BUT, as a MOM who has had three sons over the course of three decades, play video games, I can say - I don't hear as much yelling.I'm not a gamer, but I have come to learn that words like \"lagging\" and \"buffering\" and \"effed up\" mean something is bad. And my son was saying (or yelling) that quite a bit.He got this and now his gaming has been going great. It's been a few months and no problems have popped up.He installed it himself without much issue. His games and apps run better and he said his streaming is better.",

It's possible that DDR5-8000 won't be stable long-term, in which case I will have to back it down to somewhere between 7200-7800 MTS, as it is very unusual to get 8000 MTS stable on 4-dimm boards. After that, I intend to start overclocking the CPU.My current 14900K is very average, at least based upon the SP core ratings, but it may have a better than average memory controller, since the IMC is running at 2 GHz. I will try to update my review once I complete all of my testing.I got this board as kind of an experiment to see what can be done on a mid-range Z790 motherboard when it comes to CPU and memory overclocking, since this is the last hurrah for LGA1700.System Specs:Asus Z790-F Gaming Wifi 2Intel i9-14900K SP = 97 (P-core SP = 106, E-core SP = 80), PL1 = 195w, PL2 = 165w, Asus MCE disabledG.Skill Trident Z5 2x24 GB DDR5-8000 (40-48-48-48-128-2T @1.35v, gear 2), SK Hynix M-dieCorsair HX1500i2 GB Samsung 990 ProAsus ROG Strix LCII 360mm AIOOpen air test bench",
