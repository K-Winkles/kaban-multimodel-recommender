Ended up installing an NVMe SSD M.2 stick as well. Very fast I/O. Installed the latest BIOS. My RAM was apparently to slow to overclock. I'll update that later. The MOBO does everything I need it to do and them some. Highly recommended.",

I have been building computers for close to 20 years and this is the first motherboard I have had a problem with. ASUS is no longer a quality product so I would recommend that no one ever buys a ASUS product. I will never buy another ASUS motherboard.",

I would not hesitate to purchase this board again.",

Shipping and the return process was lightning fast and easy. The mobo would get hung on boot up while my Nvidia 1660 super GPU was installed, even with the replacement. Turns out I just needed to boot with no GPU installed once, then power down and restart with GPU installed. Booted up, and allowed me to update bios via internet. It is a powerful mobo for the money, and the AI overclock is great. I love it. highly recomended.",

Sort of KNOWING that this was likely to happen, AND my flawless track-record with Asus motherboards, I ordered the X299-A II, connected everything to it and I was up and running with only a few MSI startup items to delete and some Asus specific items to install. Back to editing as easy as that. Stress test benchmark even produced a better score than the same processor in the MSI MoBo. Excellent Asus X299 board.",
