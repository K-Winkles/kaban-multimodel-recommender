I got it during Black Friday for just $155 which is a great price; it is heavy compared to previous boards I've had but it is a very good looking one.I paired it with a Ryzen 7700X CPU and a Crucial Pro RAM 32GB Kit (CP2K16G56C46U5) and the system started wihtout issues (although memory training takes about 40-50 seconds the first time, so be patience); I love the physical power button on board is very convenient for testing.To have in mind:1) Initially I was getting no video, but the issue was my monitor; turn it on manually before booting your PC and make sure you manually set the source to be used instead of letting the monitor to auto-detect it.2) I had to update the BIOS in order to overclock my RAM kit from the default 5200MT/s to 5600MT/s3) Once you system is up and running, I suggest to set the \"boot speed\" option on the BIOS to \"fast\".",

                "reviewText": "Edited my previous review for more concise writing and less snark.Recently, I attempted to build a PC with the Gigabyte Aero G B650, a RTX 4090, and a 7800X3D. The Gigabyte was actually my second motherboard; my previous one, from a different manufacturer, had connectivity problems with the integrated LAN adaptor.This Gigabyte, unfortunately, was also saddled with a major problem. 20% of the time, I just wouldn't boot. The system would black screen and never make it past the POST. However, the other 80% of the time, it'd work just fine.Prior experience (and a little googling) says that black screens on cold boots are usually memory issues. However, my particular set of memory - two sticks of 16gb G. Skill Trident Z Neo RGB, 6000mhz with CL30 timing - was known to be good. I just used it in the same build with the previous motherboard with no issues. And in hindsight, I was able to use it with a subsequent motherboard, also with no issues. Once I made it in Windows, I could stress test the memory and brutalize it and the system was stable. It was just the cold boot that had frequent hangs.It's a little odd because this G. Skill is on the accepted RAM list. This problem occurred regardless if I was using stock or EXPO settings. There's not a lot I can do to make a pre-boot issue go away. I tried flashing multiple BIOS versions to see if one would be better than the other, but they all failed. At the end of the day, I didn't have faith in Gigabyte that they would fix this problem quickly, so I returned the motherboard within my 30 day window for one from a different manufacturer.I'm sure this is an isolated issue - if it wasn't, you'd hear waaaay more about it from other users. And heck, maybe it was a hardware issue specific to my board alone. But if you're planning a future build with any number of 16gb G. Skill Trident Z Neo RGB at 6000mhz and CL30 timings like I did, approach it very carefully.",

                "reviewText": "A few key takeaways:1. Looks great2. Physical power button on mobo is very convenient for testing3. Quick locks for the m.2 slots are really nice. No more having to fiddle with tiny m2 screws.4. BIOS is simple to use and it's easy enough to find setting within the BIOS menu5. RAM overclocking seems to be stable enough if you update the BIOS to the latest",
