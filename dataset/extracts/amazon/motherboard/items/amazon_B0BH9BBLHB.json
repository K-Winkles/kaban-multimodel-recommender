The board arrived with the cpu socket cover floating around in the anti-static bag and multiple socket pins were already damaged. It's the first damaged board upon receipt in my 25 years of building PCs. There were no seals on the product box. Hard to believe it could have made it through QA like that.I immediately submitted a return for refund upon receving and opening it. I'm disappointed but I'll try one more time for this model because it's one of the better options for a z790 with a pcie 5.0 m.2 slot.Update: the second one arrived and wouldn't POST. Returned it for refund again.I bought an ASUS board and now everything is working with the same components I tried on the gigabyte board. I really wanted to try a brand other than ASUS but it just didn't work out this time.",

Historically I only bought ASUS drives, this one is very well made. Solid, does not bend. The bios update was quick and painless using QFLASH. I couldn't be happier. Running latest Intel 5 13900k.Looks just fantastic. I preferred the aluminum look.. Get a great case and time your RGB fans and it is just incredible.",

                "reviewText": "I have been building gaming desktops for years. I tend to favor Asus and Gigabyte mother boards. The first thing I noticed was that the manual and the drivers disc where both missing. I contacted the seller who indicated that this is how the item came from the factory. Cost cutting? In defense of Gigabyte, the item did look like it was previously opened so your experience may be different. I was able to download the latest drivers and the manual from the Gigabyte website and so I could continue with my build.The next challenge involved the cooler for the CPU which was hitting the heat sink for the M.2 drive. I\u2019m not sure how Gigabyte missed this \u2013 unless they expect you to buy some custom CPU cooler. This was almost a deal breaker until I noticed this MB supports both types of M.2 drives and I had the PCIe type which connected elsewhere on the MB. Still the heat sink needed to be removed to allow the CPU cooler sufficient space to be installed properly. If you have a SATA M.2 SSD then removing this heatsink is not an option for you. Instead you can probably cut the top of it off to provide just enough clearance for the CPU cooler. I doubt this will reduce its cooling capacity too much \u2013 I haven\u2019t tried this so cannot say for sure.Lastly, the BIOS is reasonably intuitive for standard setups. Autoconfig properly detected all my hardware, drives, fanes, memory, etc. If you want to fiddle with the more advanced settings this can be a little tricky but there is more information to be found on the internet. I was annoyed by an alert to install Gigabyte Control Center which kept coming up each time I rebooted. There was a checkbox to disable the alert but it did nothing. I have noticed that Asus and Gigabyte are generally pretty good at designing the MB \u2013 they are not so good at designing software. I have always had far more problems with their monitoring and software so now I never install them; only the MB drivers get installed. This alert can also be disabled in the BIOS, under settings. This is what the internet says and this is what Gigabyte support says. What they don\u2019t tell you is that this option is buried deeply. I had trouble trying to locate it. Fortunately there was a search option which is how I managed to find it. Search for \"Gigabyte Utilities Downloader Configuration\".Now my PC is working great and the M.2 SSD (Samsung) is really fast.",

                "reviewText": "This board will work fine with 4 sticks of DDR5 up to 5200mhz but anything higher and it's super buggy. Here's an example:I bought 4 sticks of DDR5-6000. I enabled XMP in the bios along with changing the VDDQ settings to 1.40v like in numerous forums and videos I've watched. The PC will then boot into Windows just fine. Everything is stable. Games are fine. As soon as I do a restart I get a boot failure message. If I shut down instead of reboot the PC will continue to boot up fine but the minute I go to reboot it will not boot back up until I clear the BIOS. Turning memory fast boot on and off does nothing. These kinds of bugs are what is going to keep me away from Gigabyte motherboards from now on.",

Me preocupaba un poco la altura del disipador de calor para PCIe 5 NVMe, pero logr\u00e9 instalar un enfriador de CPU bastante voluminoso Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE en modo PUSH/PULL perfectamente y sin problemas.Mi \u00fanico descontento fue con la instalaci\u00f3n de los controladores restantes de la placa, tuve que hacerlo con una tarjeta de red USB inal\u00e1mbrica aparte, por que los controladores Ethernet y WIFI de la antena externa que incluye, simplemente no estaban presentes despu\u00e9s del formateo, los que est\u00e1n en la p\u00e1gina oficial de Gigabyte marcan un error de que se instalaron incorrectamente y posteriormente no los reconoce, investigue y algunas placas con el Chipset Z790 est\u00e1n teniendo el mismo problema, al final se soluciono instalando todas las actualizaciones de Windows y ya fueron reconocidos.",
