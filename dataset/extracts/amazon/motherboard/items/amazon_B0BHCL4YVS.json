With this issue I had returned the item and it took them over a month to send me a new one. When the new one finally arrived I was the same exact board from before. Dead ram slot however this time they didn't even bother to send it in the products original packaging. I went back to support and all they said was to repeat the same process of returning again. I don't trust Amazon any more after that and I'm not going through the return process again because I can't trust they won't just send the same problem back to me. Hope this helps future buyers just go to NewEgg much better product.",
