                "reviewText": "I installed this motherboard to my am5 system recently. There isn\u2019t a single thing wrong with it. It has some luxury features as shown on the ad. The most notable ones are probably 2.5g Ethernet, bios flashback, display port and HDMI, 3 pcie slots, and cooling plate for your ssd. It also came with a manual, sata cables, and screws.Overall, this motherboard was extremely easy and nice to work with as a first time builder. The places you\u2019re supposed to put screws in (on top of the standoffs) have highlights on them, so it\u2019s easy to see. The pcie tab is relatively easy to push down, the ram was easy to install (the channels are both gray). I had no problems with this motherboard and the manual came in handy many times. It doesn\u2019t have a shield, nor does it need one, as it has one built in.This motherboard feels high quality and well made. My system is running perfectly with this in it. I love it, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to build with am5.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this Motherboard to go with a Ryzen 7800X3D, a 5700XT GPU, and some OLOy 5600MHz RAM, as that seems to be the highest speed that will work with this motherboard.The TUF Gaming B650-PLUS booted with no problems at all on the first try. The only hiccup was that it apparently needs a mouse and keyboard connected to show anything, even the EUFI. This was only a minor concern, as most motherboards are like this and anyone who has built a computer before will know.The CPU lever was extremely tense to pull down. If you've never used an AM4/AM5 socket before, be prepared for how hard you have to pull that lever. I had to Google check to make sure I wasn't about to break anything. There were plenty of screws, hookups, extra wires, brackets, everything I needed and MORE came with this Motherboard.I'm not entirely sure what was going on with the WiFi antenna... I tried plugging it in but couldn't seem to get Windows to recognize it or find any networks with it. I suspected I might have accidentally broken it when trying to put it together incorrectly, so I didn't dock any points for that, as it was probably my fault.Altogether, I wanted to write this review because I was a little bit worried reviewing something rated at 4-ish stars, but my experience was a BREEZE. Physical manuals were included (thank you, ASUS), and they must have improved their translating services because it's actually written in native English now. Great experience with this product!!",

                "reviewText": "I've only had this board for a couple months, so I can't vouch for its long term stability, but it has been fairly solid so far. I like that it supports ECC RAM (if you enable it in the EFI setup).Minor problems I've noticed:- The top-of-DIMM retaining clips on the black slots are physically different from the blue ones: the plastic caps that hold down the DIMMs are loose, and they rattle if there's any vibration on the board while they're empty.- It sometimes failed to boot, hanging at a black screen instead, during the first week or two that I had it. I don't know why, or why it stopped. (This was with BIOS 1616, and it stopped before new BIOS versions became available.)- I wish there was a POST error code display.- I wish PCIe 5.0 was routed to one of the card slots. I would gladly sacrifice bandwidth on one of the *three* m.2 connectors, or even give up one of those SSD connectors entirely, for this.- I wish the I/O panel had more USB ports.- I wish it had an optical audio output.- I wish the analog audio output had a bit more bass. Music doesn't sound as rich as it does with my Audigy PCIe card. Raising the bass in my amplifer helps somewhat.- I wish the bluetooth/wifi module was easy to examine and replace, instead of being buried under a plastic housing that doesn't seem designed for easy removal.",

Updated BIOS to current version first, enabled TMP for Windows 11 Home install. All went great. I did have an issue when I was checked the BIOS on exit I opted to load optimized settings. That enabled Armory Crate which then caused issues for all the user accounts without admin rights. It tries to load Armory Crate on every logon and has to have admin rights. I called ASUS and had to have serial number for Motherboard. Sent me link for a Armory Removal App. I also had to disable the setting to load Armory Crate in the BIOS. That is what that Optimized settings enabled and once installed could not get rid of it till I used the uninstall app. Very happy with system runs great. Needed the Wi-Fi that is part of the motherboard and it works very good too. No Ethernet connection where computer is located.",

                "reviewText": "Coming from some other brand's horrid coil whine. (You will find which brand with searching B650+coil whine) Some say this is normal these days due to increased power consumption and variable driving voltage, etc etc. Nope, all lies! You should not hear coil whine when the system is idle!!And no, this board wasn't plagued by those 'bad' coils at all. As attached, it may not be perfect example, the OCCT stress fails to even instigate any coil noise from CPU side at all. And yes, my CPU is not a power hungry monster but the previous Gigabyte B650 was extremely noisy with coil whine.So, yes, if you're looking for a budget B650, definitely head into ASUS TUF although it is not exactly cheaper than any mATX boards. Yet, this board isn't more expensive than those 'high-end' gaming lineup.Here are some pros and cons.Pros:1. Now TUF is also providing the AIO PWM signal! TUF B560 didn't have it. But this newer generation seems to have the 4 pin slot for AIO.2. The CPU_OPT is still tied with the main CPU_FAN. Good for twin tower air cooling set up.3. Whopping 3 ARGB (5V 3pin) slots, still support 12V slots! It can be a budget, but we can still make it shine!4. XMP up to 6000 was no problem!5. VRM heatsink has stepping shape. I've installed a Thermalright Peerless Assassin (RGB variant) but it could hold even larger, i.e. Noctua DH-15, air cooler. But then again, I was able to put my hand into over the VRM heatsink to connect the CPU power cables!cons.1. It could be pros but half of USB 3.0 slots are C-type and they aren't all Thunderbolt. But these days, those PD charging cables are everywhere.2. The WiFi is not Intel, it is rather MediaTek MT7921 WiFi 6 (not E) I'm fine with not being 6E since 6E routers are expensive as heck anyway. But being MT7921 means Windows cannot automatically detect the WiFi card even after installation. You have to prepare a WiFi/Bluetooth driver separately. Also, considering what I've been through with Asus gaming laptops, it could cause some connectivity issue if you install older driver, didn't happen to me yet.3. Second PCI-E x16 slot becomes useless if you install 3 slot GPU, as seen in the picture. So, technically, the only expansion slot you can use, if you have a high-end gaming GPU, is the only tiny PCI x1 port. This is because the main PCI-E x16 slot is not located at the top slot.Yes, it is a bit budget side board with a few limitations. But it does its job fine. That other TUF I've mentioned was Intel B560 mATX and it is running fine under 24/7 running some simulation task since 2021 January. I should have went to TUF at the first.",

La tengo funcionando con 2 m.2 de 1 Tb cada uno, marca DW_Black, un SSD Sata Kingston de 1 TB y dos HDDs de 500 Gb. Viene con tornillos para los m.2 por si se lo preguntaban. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con dos disipadores y cada uno con su pad t\u00e9rmico correspondiente. Est\u00e1 funcionando con una RTX 3070, previamente con una RX 6650 XT; y un Ryzen 5 5600G. Debo agregar que no tuve que actualizar la BIOS ni nada de eso, pero si llegase a ser necesario cuenta con BIOS Flash. O sea, se puede actualizar via USB sin tener que andar colocando un CPU de generaci\u00f3n pasada. Los \u00fanicos dos detalles son que, primero, vas a necesitar un fan hub si quieres conectar m\u00e1s de 3 ventiladores. Segundo. Puede que llegues a encontrarte con que los controladores del modulo WiFi/Bluetooth est\u00e1n desactualizados y Windows te dir\u00e1 que ya tienes las \u00faltimas versiones. Me pas\u00f3 cuando instal\u00e9 por segunda vez el Win10. Pero por cualquier cosa que llegue a suceder, la soluci\u00f3n es bien sencilla. Te vas a google y buscas \"Controladores Asus TUF Gaming B550M-Plus\" y en el primer resultado, en la p\u00e1gina de Asus te descargas \"Controlador Intel WiFi V22.80.1.1 para Windows 10/11 de 64 bits\" e \"Intel Bluetooth driver V22.80.0.4 para Windows 10/11 de 64 bits\". En s\u00ed, la mother tiene un dise\u00f1o decente. El RGB es jaja casi ni se nota. Siendo francos, hubiese preferido la ROG Strix B550m pero pues por desesperado termin\u00e9 comprando esta, que c\u00f3mo digo, no est\u00e1 mal, pero me gustaba m\u00e1s la ROG xD Pues nada jaja, eso es todo lo que tengo que a\u00f1adir.",

                "reviewText": "Es una motherboard de entrada. no es la mas barata ni la mas cara, funciona con cualquier procesador Ryzen fabricado hasta la fecha ya sea 1000 o 5000 eso es lo que me hizo comprarla.Tiene 2 espacios para NVMe pero una es 3.0 y la otra es 2.0 tengan en cuenta esto al comprar las NVMe y no gasten de mas (cualquier NVMe 3.0 es compatible en el puerto 2.0 pero estara limitada a 2000 MB/s mas que suficiente para guardar juegos).Tiene solo 3 pins ventiladores del case. mas 1 para el CPU y otro para el AIO pump para enfriamento liquido.Cuenta con 2 conectores RGB de 4 pin a 12V, NO son compatibles con ARGB de 5V.Tiene un boton de BIOS Flashback para que no tengan ningun problema para actualizar el bios en caso de requerirlo, es una maravilla por el precio.Los puestos PCIe son 3.0 pero si usas la segunda M.2 se desctivan todo excepto el primer puerto y el ultimo PCIe 2.0x4 y dos puertos sata de los 6 que tiene.Si compran tarjetas graficas de nueva generacion, funciona sin problemas pero tengan en cuenta que las RTX 3050 y la 6500XT usan PCIe 4.0x4 no usa los 16 lanes del conector y tendrian perdida de rendimiento, asi que si ese es la que piensa usar o compren otra tarjeta o otra grafica la RX 6600 y RTX 3060 en adelante si usan los 16 lanes y no tendran ningun problema de rendimiento con ellas.",
