I had been looking at this board for about a month, seeing the reviews roll in and becoming rather skeptical.I had no issues getting everything installed, it has all the RGB connection that you could ever wish for. It did the usual 3-4 initial boots during the first boot and windows 11 installed without a hiccup. Same goes for the firmware update.My only hiccup was adding my graphics card which did not display anything, long story short, my card will only work with the power adapter that came with the card. I used the one that came with my PSU, which resulted int he card not being detected. I assume that this is the reason others had issues as well.Very happy with the result.",

I am running i7 13700k with nzxt 280mm aio, Evga 3080ti, Corsair 6000 cl36 ram with xmp on and all the other settings stock. Just adjusted fan curves and updated the bios. In Cinebench23 for 10 minutes it gave me a score of 29845 multi core with temperatures no higher then 83 which I am very happy with it but I will try to OC it to see if I can get 30k score. 230watts max I saw without me undervolting or changing any setting in bios.

Thought I would chime in here since GIGABYTE boards seem to have fewer reviews and generally the GIGABYTE brand gets a bad rep.I built my PC with this board, and I am glad I did. I haven't had any issues with overclocking/undervolting or making any system adjustments in BIOS. The board came ready with the (2nd to most) recent BIOS that allowed my 14th gen i9 14900k to work as well, without needing any sort of update.One minor hiccup was with the WiFi and Bluetooth drivers. It's not really on them, kind of just on me - you need Windows 11 to use the Bluetooth and WiFi features, as the drivers are only available for Win11 setup. I can confirm that I tried to install them on Windows 10, and while it seemed to run the install file, it didn't work and ended up aborting the install. Ironically, upgrading to Windows 11 also seemed to improve my performance in games? I used to have a stuttering issue that is much less noticeable now. Either way, not on them, mostly on me. The only other issue is that the BIOS UI is a bit ugly and less intuitive than my experience with ASUS in the past, but it's navigable and once you look things up, not hard to manage.The motherboard is also gorgeous in person, the pictures do not do it justice. I built it in a b/w case, doing white parts on a black interior and white exterior. This looks perfect in my case, having the bare minimum black in its design and being a large white space in my case to help balance the colors. I think that the only other real option (that you can still buy, since ASUS won't restock those Z790s) is the NZXT white mobo. Otherwise, if you really want an all-white board, not one with white highlights, this is your option.The main reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars is that, while I personally have only had a good experience with it, it's kind of overpriced. There is a very similar model as others have pointed out, and it's like $100 less, the BIGGEST feature being that this motherboard is white. I also wish it had more USB ports but I just use a million devices, so probably not applicable to most users. I'm personally fine with what I paid for it, but it's definitely not the most cost-to-feature effective mobo.",
