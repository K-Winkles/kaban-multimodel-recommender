                "reviewText": "Some reviews complain that it won't post but really, they ship this with an outdated bios that doesn't recognize the newer CPUs and RAM. You have to update the bios with a USB using the flash button on the board. After that it works perfectly.The onboard LEDs telling you the POST codes is very helpful especially since hardware changes result in a 60 second boot but you can see the progress.There is a hard to get to M2 slot under one of the LED displays but I think that's by design since using it will share lanes with the PCIe slot meant for your GPU. Since it's not obvious you need to remove the LED display to get to it most people will use the other two slots below it which is correct.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve replaced a Z590 hero from Asus with this board. So far it\u2019s been great but it hasn\u2019t been a smooth ride. I\u2019ve seen a few bugs that still need to me smooth over. For one, XMP only works if you have 2 dim slots filled. I recently got all 4 filled with the same speed and timing and I got a blue screen of death with the code saying I have ram issues. At first I thought it was the 2 new ram sticks but that wasn\u2019t the case. Alone the two worked great with XMP but as all 4 it would crash. I turned off XMP and the pc booted fine but at 4000 instead of 5200 as labeled. Another bug was the constant led / AniMatrix constantly crashing and not responding to the Armory crate. I would have to restart my pc just to be able to get it working. After 4 bios updates the led keeps working in sync but the AniMatrix crashes after 4 hours. I have to restart in order to get it working. The motherboard however has its greatest features such as the nice Oled display, cool rgb in the side. The backplate is a neat feature. Comes with tons of accessories. Overall great motherboard. I\u2019m glad I opted for this instead of the Z690 Hero.",

I tried MULTIPLE times with two different boards. First board would not POST, second started smoking at the PCIE slot the first time I powered on. It would not POST unless I plugged HDMI directly into MB. and then it would turn itself off after 5 mins of being on. The new ASUS AIO Riyujin 2 360 cooler just would not work. None of it worked.ASUS Customer Support is BAD.. I must have spent well over 10 hours talking to them over 45 days time and completed 5-6 forms and returned.Ok, where should I start.1st off.

Current GPU I use in my current build)Was super excited to get this board as I rock with Asus. My current build consists of mostly Asus parts and I even use Asus Monitors - love the brand been using for years. Excitement quickly turned into disappointment.I was so disappointed building this computer. I spent ALOT of money buying these parts only for the first motherboard to never POST. I assembled and disassembled it at least 30 times. I called ASUS and they were the most unhelpful Customer Service I ever encountered. I got fed up and sent the MB back. Amazon provided another.With newer board I assembled using the same parts and first time powering on I saw smoke coming from the PCIE slot - (That's a bad thing). It didn't deter me.. I was determined to get it to work. Assembled using all parts.. Could not get MB to acknowledge Strix 1080 TI GPU. I plugged HDMI cable into MB and it posts!!! But that was short lived as the AIO cooler never turned on therefore overheating MB and Intel chip. MB would shut down after 5 mins. This lasted for 2 weeks. I tried every single thing I could think of until I figured out it could be bad GPU or Bad PCIE slot on MB. It couldn't be bad GPU as the GPU still works in current build. Nevertheless I called ASUS and they put me back through the rat race with Customer Service reps that did not speak clear English and they asked the same questions and sent me the same forms to complete. I gave up. I clearly gave up.To build a computer will normally take 40 minutes to an hour - maybe 2 max. I worked on this build with this MB for over 45 DAYS!!! I troubleshooted my heart out and when I couldn't do anymore ASUS came in with the absolute worst customer service you could ever ask for. So I returned MB defeated.Who knows maybe I will try again after ASUS works out kinks. But this was a complete waste of $1K and 45 days of my life. I even turned down Photo and Video gigs so I could get this rig up and running.",

The motherboard stock try\u2019s to push your cpu and GPU to its limits which was a concern at first with high CPU temps but I was able to disable a setting in bios to calm it down. Other than that I am happy I was able to get this mother board the best one I\u2019ve ever owned.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this and updated the bios for a 13900k. Super easy bios update. Setting up the OC like every Asus board is super easy (but like all overclocking takes awhile with testing). The board has tons of features and comes with lots of swag. Has 4 m.2 slots for gen 4. The oled screen beats out rgb in my opinion let\u2019s you see cpu temp usage ect right on the board. Overall if your looking for the most frills board this is it",
