                "reviewText": "The only thing some users might not like it the position of one of four SATA ports. If you plug SATA cable that is not on 90 angle, it would be impossible to install full length graphics card. The board allows for overclocking, but it does not make it easy by providing +/- values listed. Instead user has to enter new values. It requires knowledge of voltages and frequencies to set up overclocking correctly. Provided by Gigabyte SIV software allows for easier overclocking and setting XMP for RAM. Unfortunately SIV does not display RAM (DDR4) speed correctly while displaying it's status. I think it's a Windows 10 issue. Thankfully, DVD disc provided with the motherboard has a CPU-Z that correctly displays RAM speed, so there is a way to verify that settings are applied correctly. I have used this mobo to build a home office PC with Athlon 3000G and it's build in Vega 3. It allowed me to reliably overclock APU to 4.025 GHz with core voltage of 1.4V. I'm using SATA SSD, so I have not tried NVMe functionality on this board. AMD claims that Ryzen is required for NVMe to actually work as a system drive, but there are reviews of systems with Athlon 3000G working fine with NVMe as a boot/system drive. It worked with Athlon 3000G out of the box without any firmware update, so it is Ryzen 3000 ready (3000G requires the same mobo firmware as ZEN 2 Ryzen processors). The board is not flimsy and seems to be well build. The built-in RGB lighting on thy mobo is basically an orange light that can be turned on or of. That's it. There is however an RGB header for other components. The one shortcoming is that there are only two fan headers, one for CPU and the other for the case, so in some builds it means that additional splitters controllers are required, or fans will have to work at constant speed being not controlled by motherboard. For the price it is still a very good product.",

                "reviewText": "If you are interested in wifi, and bluetooth as a bonus, I would easily recommend getting the B450M DS3H WIFI (rev. 1.0) on amazon over this product at this time for $20 more. Otherwise it is possible to fit a wifi on the lower PCIe x 4, but it is very cramped, reduces GPU airflow, and I've even noticed that it occasionally shuts the wifi down when the heat gets too intense from my stress tests.Like other reviews have noted, if you install a GPU the PCIe x1 slot below it along with the CMOS battery are completely covered. Also don't plan on putting a second GPU in this motherboard. It is impossible to install another GPU without covering the USB2, 1, COM, and TPM inputs, and in my DIYPC mini case a second GPU wouldn't fit due to cramping with the PSU, so you would need at least a mid tower to accomplish that.There is only 1 system fan PWM connection?!? So yes, I had to get a couple of fan splitters to remedy this for my 4 fan set up.Besides those issues, it is a truly wonderful, budget motherboard, but get the wifi version.PS you will still need a fan splitter with the wifi version so ya :p",

This did not happen in my son's build which I did first. Could not figure out why.

Happy to day, once updated, worked fine. Also had to use an PCIe graphics board's VGA port to be able to set up the BIOS configuration, my monitor just would not sync on HDMI at boot time. This may be a failing on my monitor, but it is a common issue I believe.Decided to run an early beta version of Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and that has worked out great with the on board, Radeon graphics driver, all except dual monitors...An attractive, low cost, blistering fast Linux box, with 32GB main RAM. It runs several instance of various OS's in Oracle virtual box no sweat, and was easy on the wallet.Easy to recommend.",
