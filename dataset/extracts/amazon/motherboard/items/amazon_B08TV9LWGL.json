There is some criticism that it lacks M.2 but this is made up by the PCIe expansion slot which can take a single or dual M.2 SSD adapter card spec'd for NVMe (the highest data rate). This gives you the choice of up to two NVMe SSDs (or one NVMe, and one SATA) instead of only one on-board SSD. The on-board video is Intel UHD 630 which is adequate for most needs. A suggestion is to visit the Intel website for the most optimized video driver.",

It is well built, the BIOS is default to legacy. I had to do reinstall on my windows to utilize UEFI but that is not the MB's problem, that is an issue when switching from MBR to GPT to be able to use UEFI and over 2TB storage and even some games need TPM enabled. This MB allowed to do just that.",
