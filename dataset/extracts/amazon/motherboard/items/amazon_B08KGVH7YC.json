The USB speeds and compatibility are definitely improved from the B450 model.Worth noting, the headers for CPU and case fans were swapped on this board from what I had in the past but that was easily redone when wiring the new board.Performance is great and everything runs smooth. For reference my build is a Ryzen 9 5900X and an RTX 4070ti Super (Gigabyte Gaming OC)",

                "reviewText": "The good: This mobo looks great and installs easily. The dual m.2 slots and the heat syncs that cover them are nice and everything is pretty easy to access. Also comes with an adapter to simplify connection of the tiny power switch/LED and reset connectors.The bad: BIOS update required out of the box. This is simple and the BIOS interface makes it super easy. Just kind of crummy the board doesn\u2019t ship with latest already installed.Bluetooth keeps dropping. Research indicates that this may be due to the hardware having issues waking from hibernation, but Gigabyte support appears to be ignoring the issue at this point. The only workaround people have found is to flush your capacitors (power off, unplug, wait, then reverse). If you\u2019re gaming and use a BT controller, you may want to find alternatives to this board or wait until this issue is cleared. The way their support is responding to the issue (or not, really) could mean a long wait on that one...Still, overall, I do like this mobo a lot. So if native Bluetooth support isn\u2019t high on your list of wants, I would recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "This board is definitely better than my ASRock B550M Steel Legend. The BIOS is easier for tuning, and being a larger board has more M2 slots. The built-in WiFi/Bluetooth is also really nice. Doesn't have as nice of a RGB layout on the board itself if that's what you're into, but that wasn't a deal breaker for me. I've also experienced an MSI motherboard recently that a friend had for a Ryzen 7800X3D... gotta say I wasn't a huge fan of that BIOS interface either. The Gigabyte is by far the superior of the three, though I don't have recent experience to compare it with an Asus board. I'm very happy with this board and would choose it again in a heartbeat, unless I have some experience with Asus and am blown away by it.",

                "reviewText": "One of the cheaper b550 board w/ wifi you can find on the market. Due to personal reason have to use WLAN, was choosing between asus tuf plus and this one.Pros: Full feature set you can expect from b550, good VRM thermal, no heat problem for multi-core OC (I don't have a 5900x so idk about that one, but if you use R9 might as well go for x570). Have more than enough io for most pc users; the free antenna works perfectly, great signal strength. The bios update and tweaking was smooth without any issue. Overall experience was good, definitely recommend.Cons: B550 AORUS Mobo family has this common issue of failing to detect bluetooth adaptor, so you will see bluetooth missing in the system(even after you show hidden item in device manager). This can be solved by cold booting the system (i.e. cut off the power from outlet or off the PSU before next bootup). I guess this is a BIOS problem as something in the HW power up sequence was not properly reset, detected or timed. Anyway, at the time of this review, latest BIOS haven't solve the problem.P.S. If your pc case doesn't have any front usb-c port, go for V1.",
