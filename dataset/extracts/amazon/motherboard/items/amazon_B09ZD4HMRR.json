                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I absolutely love this motherboard. I previously owned a z690p d4 from Asus and was left painfully in the dark by it's stupidly limited troubleshooting capabilities, it lacked even a status led.This motherboard is the best thing I've ever gotten, every single part is clearly well though out and designed valuing the realistic usage of the parts along with the performance of them. The immense troubleshooting equipment that it includes and are easily accessible and observable were night and day. On board led numerical temperature displays, well designed and protected board components, overbuilt but also tasteful and effective design. I'm blown away by the products quality and overall well though out design.I will never be buying another brands motherboards again.Not to mention this motherboard has some of the most present, but, extremely TASTEFUL RGB. The one issue I have had has to do with customizing the lighting of the two RGB zones. One zone is on the back io VRM , the other is right below the CPU socket. Both are very bright and are well designed. The rear Io is very generous with it's connectivity and has everything I've possibly wanted. The one note I have is there is only one USB 3.0 header on the board for front Io, so be aware of this if you must have all the front Io. Albiet USB 3.0 pcie cards exist.Lastly. One thing I found great but often a bit challenging was routing the 24 pin connection. Because of the board being EATX and the 24 pin header being directed to the RIGHT, it can be a bit challenging to get that connection to fit well. This is definitely a relatively easily remedied challenge that of which isnt a bit deal because I do love the concept of the side facing headers.I'm not yet into overclocking but getting this board was also part of future proofing for headroom for that. I've looked around the BIOS a lot and I've been extremely pleased with it. I find it much better organized and more functional than my previous Asus board's bios.Overall I'm definitely how a proud owner of an EVGA product in my device, and would 2000% recommend this product to anyone looking for high quality and ROBUST troubleshooting capabilities which makes diagnosing any problems 10 fold easier and faster. On board reset, power off and on, and temperature display and many status LEDs make this board a DREAM to work with.I got this product on sale for I believe it was around 350 USD.THIS IS 100% IN MY OPINION THE BEST BOARD AT THIS PRICE POINT (especially when it is on this sale specifically)Do buy this board. Especially, when it is on sale. It will not disappoint and it was the perfect answer to wanting a minimalist and robust motherboard that truly was a statement of performance in my system.So glad I bought EVGA. Now a proud owner.",

Surprisingly motherboard still letting me into the EVGA bios screen and I was able to do the system bios update. After this process, it was so smooth and easy as first time pc builder.

                "reviewText": "My first Intel EVGA board, not off to a good start:- No OEM packaging - Where's the box? Came in bubble wrap and zip-lock bagsSo my guess with the damage, Amazon or EVGA RMA division inspected and sent back out...but that means the previous buyer kept the package?!Of course I can bring up the original online order to see if I missed it saying it was refurbished or open box.IF EVGA and or Amazon want to make this right, send me a z690 classified box. I will decide in the next week whether I am send this back. The heat fin damage is minor and I could use a \"sharpee\" to color in the polished aluminum.In fairness, I am writing this review immediately after opening it and so I am still peeved about this sale.",

                "reviewText": "I'm very pleased with the EVGA Z690 Classified motherboard. It is well laid out and has LEDs that give very good information as to how the system is running. It is well constructed, and has attractive RGB lighting. I would advise anyone who buys this motherboard to be sure to check the back of it. To confirm that has a backplate for supporting a heatsink. If the backplate is not installed on the motherboard. Check the accessory box that comes with the motherboard. If the backplate is not in the box, it will be necessary to order one directly from EVGA, with a delivery time of about three days via USPS. I HIGHLY recommend EVGA because of their excellent products. They also have EXCELLENT Tech and customer service.",

                "reviewText": "The EVGA Z690 with WiFiLike another review...7 hours of working with it and got it to work.Received Q code 12 after using provided flash drive to update BIOS (following manual and internet advice).IF YOU BUY, simplified instructions:-Use the On Line manual on the EVGA website1. p143, getting the latest drivers \"to flash from power on state\" to create it on a flash drive on another computer.***after you extract the zip, Rename the bin file to \"EVGAE698.bin\" on the root of the flash drive. (very important)2. p144, follow procedures for Flashing BOIS Without a CPU3. ***!!!! the BIOS default is HDMI header is off. Q code A9 \"Start of Setup\" and post process complete. MUST use graphics card to proceed in any way. I normally do my builds without a CPU in until win10 is fully installed. Then I get the latest program and drivers for the GPU.4. If no Q code A9, press the \"BIOS Safeboot Button\" p13 that will get you into the BIOS, Change the default while you are testing and making adjustments.THIS MOTHER BOARD IS NOT FOR FIRST TIME BUILDERS!!!!!Not sure how it is for gaming or video editing or stability. I will send an update. BOIS OC program worked without issue. Seems stable so far (Day 2).WiFi is very good, I don't have much experience with onboard WiFi but is it getting great speeds.",
