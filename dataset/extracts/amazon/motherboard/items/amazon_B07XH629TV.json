                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Good enough when on sale, chipset limits RAM capacity (!!!)",
                "reviewText": "I recommend this motherboard only when it's on sale (=<$70) and only when the bare essentials are needed AND you don't mind not having the most up-to-date support for the latest generation of Ryzen CPU's as of late 2023. This also means PCIe 3.0 instead of latest PCIe 4.0, something which may be of great importance in certain PC builds e.g. using newer graphics cards which utilize a PCIe 4.0x4 connection and even PCIe 4.0x8 cards in some scenarios.VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: \"Due to chipset resource usage, the available capacity of [RAM] memory will be a little less than the amount of installed.\" [sic] -- This is straight from the motherboard manual off the MSI website (not sure if this manual even came with the motherboard). What this means for my system is 13.9 GB of usable RAM (!!!) instead of the 16 GB (2x8 GB) I bought. I'm not certain if this is a limitation of the B450 chipset (in which case, my lack of due diligence is to blame) or of the admittedly cheap RAM I bought, but, regardless, something this important should be highlighted with a corresponding amount of emphasis on the product page. It should definitely not be relegated to a single bullet point in a manual you have to download yourself! Luckily, I have not really run into issues with the lowered RAM capacity in my day-to-day use, but it's definitely something to keep in mind. On the plus side, I was able to configure XMP for my RAM.I was able to install a Ryzen 5 4600G after some troubleshooting since the BIOS version installed out-of-the-box was from April of this year. If you are installing a Ryzen chip that is newer than the 3000 series, I highly recommend that you DO NOT factory reset the BIOS during your troubleshooting like I almost did; you may be effed if you don't have a spare compatible AMD CPU in this situation. My early troubleshooting issues were ones that come with building a new PC and not so much a fault of the motherboard itself. It has not really given me any hardware/software/firmware issues, which speaks to its stability.Overall, this is a good, reliable, and cheap motherboard, but one that will likely kneecap your RAM capacity!",

I ended up purchasing this motherboard and it worked like a charm! So easy to OC with minimal requirement on my end to tweak any voltages or timings, just a simple XMP setting and i was good to go. It's great.However, I realise price of this motherboard fluctuates quite abit. Just be on the look out for a deal. I bought this motherboard for SGD154 including shipping.",
