                "reviewText": "This is a nice board. It isn't a MEG board, but it actually has more layers than the z690i Meg board that preceded this. The price is low too considering other z790 options out there. I was going to go with a ASUS Z790i board for a second build (two kids), but got a second one of these instead. It really is an excellent board if it meets your IO needs. I will break it down in categories.Looks: I find the board to be attractive. It is a silver tone leaning to the whiter side of the spectrum. I show the board in a white case with a 4090 FE and the board is a good contrast between the case and the GPU color.RGB: No onboard RGB diodes. There is a 5v RGB header, but this board only lights up for error codes. I prefer this as usually ram is RGB these days and fans. I rather not pay for RGB on a motherboard.Storage: Storage is nice on this board. 3 M.2 with 2 being 4th gen and 1 being 3rd gen. I added SATA SSD's since I have so many laying around, but you don't really have too with so much M.2 goodness. 3 us excellent for a ITX.Build quality: The board is built well. Better than most Edge boards. While it doesn't have a a full back plate, it has more payers than boards of this moniker which gives it rigidity and better overclocking on the ram from my experience.Noise: Out of the 2 boards I have, one of the founds is louder. I shouldn't say louder, but more high pitch. While I welcome the active cooling and it works well, I wish the fans noise was more consistent. It isn't loud and but you get higher pitch sound profile that most people do not prefer. Again, it isn't the same sound on both boards so it may be a one off. Not a big deal and you can't hear it unless the room is dead silent.Overclocking: OMG. I have a set of 7000 CL34 and 7200 CL34. Both are Hynix A die. I can get both to 7800 and 8000. I have to push voltages to 1.5v but since I am using a air cooler the ram doesn't exceed 55c during full load which is far below my 60c ceiling for DDR5. Besides ram , my 13600K overclocks to 5.7v all p core and 4.3 all ecore with 1.3v. That is lower voltage than what the board boosts too by default. The power delivery is clean with the board and plentiful. I also have a 13900k, but it is in a 10l case and I do not have the thermal head room to overclock it.Voltages and default power delivery: This board provides too much power at default. For example, my 13600 k only needs 1.18v to run at default clocks and boost. The board delivers up to 1.4v at default. I would suggest changing voltage through one of the auto settings or to a static voltage. The voltage will be determined by the quality of the chip you have.Temperatures: If you are running an AIO and airflow over your board isn't great, you will get some high board temperatures. PCH will get to the 80's during load for a 13600 or 13900k. They stack 2 M.2's over the PCH which adds to the heat of both the PCH and the M.2 in the lower slot. Compound that with a really fast and hot m.2 and that whole are stays hot. Board heat is common with z690 and z790 boards. The heat is within spec though. I went air cooling for a reason good air coolers are cheap and cool more than just the CPU.Overall this is a excellent board and the best value z790 out there at the time of writing this. The only downside is there is no thunderbolt. If you need thunderbolt then this is not the board for you.",

                "reviewText": "You honestly can't get anything better than the MSI MPG Z790 Edge Wifi motherboard. As someone invested in MSI products, it's safe to say I'm a little bit biased, but this motherboard has all of the bells and whistles you could possibly need. I bought it due to it supporting 12th and 13th gen intel CPUs as well as DDR5. I intend to keep this PC build, and hence the motherboard for a long time, so I wanted to future proof a bit.The BIOS was a little lackluster - as I couldn't find a way to manually select booting from my 2TB M.2 SSD, although it was recognized. Unplugging the 2.5\" SSD rectified the issue and allowed me to install windows directly to the M.2 (although it still didn't show clearly in the boot order). Other than this the BIOS is intuitive and user-friendly.The build quality of the board is very nice, overall I have no complaints and it holds up well so far - (I admit to a minor unintentional drop and it sounded rough, but nothing broke and there's no issues.) The labeling is intuitive, and you have many, many plugs and ports. (you'll never realistically be able to use all of the M.2's and SATAs, but you have options for many drives if you have an extensive game library.)My two chief complaints with this motherboard are the instructions in the box and the price. The instructions are vague, uninformative and have no words - only pictures and QR codes that link you to videos (which are somewhat helpful but just give me a description!). I highly recommend going to MSI's website and downloading the full user manual for your motherboard, as it will answer all your questions. Regarding price: you can buy other, less flashy motherboards for significantly less than I paid. Even more so if you stick to DDR4 motherboards. My desire to future proof and use MSI however, convinced me to pay the price I did.Overall, great motherboard. It's sleek, has an RGB gaming dragon logo integrated into it, has an ez debugging LED system (very useful), and a pretty easy to use BIOS. I will come back to update this in the future if anything arises.",
