                "reviewText": "I ordered this motherboard \"Renewed\" hoping to just get something usable for a decent price. My old unit is an older one. Played most games I have but my daughter gave me a VR unit. Me PC didn't care for the VR. It would play it for about 15 minutes and then it would just black out. So I was looking for something to bring me rig up to snuff on a super tight budget. So I bought this motherboard and a 5500 processor. First, the shipping was pretty fast. I got the motherboard way sooner than Amazon said. Which is great!! The motherboard isn't in a factory box. It was in a static bag and wrapped generously with bubble wrap. Included was the I/O shield, a couple sata cables, the cooler back plate and hardware, and a few other screws. It was packaged very nicely. There wasn't a driver disk or whatever else would have normally came with it new, but that didn't disappoint me as you can easily go the motherboards support page and just download it for free. And lots of PC's don't have any kind of disk drive anyway. Mine included. I did get a slight upgrade. The motherboard I ordered wasn't supposed to have WI-FI. I was looking at a few that had it but as I said, I have a very low budget. And I do have a WIFI / Bluetooth card I can stick into it. So it wasn't the biggest deal for me. But this board has WI-FI. Which is pretty awesome. I haven't actually put it in my PC yet, but it looks like it should work just fine. I will definitely update if I have any issues. I would definitely buy this again if I needed another board and I would definitely recommend it for someone looking the upgrade their computer on a tight budget. Thank you!!",
