                "reviewText": "This board first off is not a pomya motherboard. It is a SZMZ motherboard and upon first inspection it looks nice and has M.2 port, which works, for an intel chipset that did not support them when they first came out. The main problem with this motherboard is the power delivery since it builds up too much heat. It worked with a i7 2600 but the temps at idle were in the mid 50s. Under load using prime95 the system was in the mid 90s. I would recommend a case with excellent airflow if you buy this board so it stays closer to 45 degrees celsius. The motherboard other than getting too hot was great for just running an office pc.",
