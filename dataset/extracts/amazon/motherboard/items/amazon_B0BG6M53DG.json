The latest ROG VRM architecture rises to the challenge by utilizing teamed power stages to rapidly swing current, while maintaining exemplary thermal performance. MEMORY ROG has a long legacy of flexing the fastest memory performance, and DDR5 is no outlier. Thanks to improved signal routing, now enthusiast-grade kits have been driven far beyond the 7 GT/s mark on the Maximus Z790 Hero, and who knows how far future DIMMs can go?

                "reviewText": "For the most part this is a great motherboard, and it **** well better be at a $600 price point. Tons of thunderbolt, usb-c,usb 3 ports, wired antenna (though they switched to a much easier to use wifi antenna on the model immediately after this), great XMP support, same Asus bios as expected, Armory Crate and AI Suite are great (though for some reason AI Suite doens't work when Memory Protection is turned on), TPM support, 4 NVME connectors but that's where things start to suck.The only PCIE5 NVME slots \"on\" this board are actually on the PCIE expansion card, which is a complete waste for anyone who intends to use anything besides a GPU given there are only two PCIE slots.I cannot stress this enough - if you have any intention of using the onboard Intel Bluetooth adapter, you have to use the wifi antenna provided. The bluetooth adapter is absolute garbage without it. It took 3 hours of trying to understand why the connection was barely functional compared to a USB adapter with no antenna and thats why. Antenna is not optional.This motherboard will also cause tons of kernel crashes and other hardware IRQ issues until you finally install all the drivers and Windows updates, so good luck with that.",

                "reviewText": "I upgraded my PC from a Z590 Hero to this Z790 Hero, and I couldn't be more pleased... except for the lack of broad DDR 5 memory support. I tried a 4-stick 128GB Kingston DDR 5 Kit that was supposedly supported but found it very unstable. I fell back to a 2-stick 64GB Corsair kit that has been rock-solid.Otherwise, the board has many wonderful features and is easy to use. The BIOS is easy to work with and has its own manual you must read before you start your build. Certain defaults aren't trivial, and I've seen many folks freak out in the ASUS forum and blame ASUS for it. Not so!I highly recommend this motherboard.One caveat: installing Windows 11 needs attention, as the 22H2 USB doesn't contain the required LAN drivers, effectively stopping the installation. You need to prepare a separate USB stick with the drivers you can download from the ASUS site and load them during installation.Disclaimer: I am receiving a warranty extension from ASUS for my feedback.",

It has all the standard high-end motherboard features like 20 power phase, japanese capacitors, etc etc.I just purchase it because its what I had always bought in the past - Asus ROG Hero 7 and Asus ROG Crosshair 4. It just works and is aesthetically pleasing to the eye. Comes with a 3 year warranty - online registration required.It's overpriced compared to ROG motherboards of the past. Motherboards never costed more than the CPU back in the day. Now, it's more than the CPU - crazy.......",

                "reviewText": "This is a great little board that handles all of today's gaming demands. My only gripe about this board is the audio chip used. It has two real problems with it. First, if you use a Logitech (or similar) 5.1 or 7.1 surround audio system, don't use the onboard audio. The physical cables (including fiber optic) don't map correctly and you won't have rear and bass channels. Second, the sonic application used to in windows 11 is absolutely garbage. If you just run the app for more than 2-3 minutes and are tweaking things, it basically locks not only the application up, but the hardware audio chip as well. You end up having to power the board completely off to get audio back. After some googling, I find that this is a known issue with this audio chip and that Asus is working on it, but so far no luck. Outside of the audio, everything else runs great. Nice and compact and I run all of the NVMe slots and it was easy to setup and use. If your running a 4000 series nvidia card, realize your going to lose out on the second PCI slot, it's exposed, but nothing will fit. This is expected with such big graphics cards now.",
