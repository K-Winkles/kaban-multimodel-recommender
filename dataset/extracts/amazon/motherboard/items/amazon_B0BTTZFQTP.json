I replaced the WiFi AC card before I even installed the CPU. Picked up an AX210/BT5.3 card for about $20 on Amazon as well. Everything went great, running everything I throw at it with great speed and efficiency. Dances circles around my old Ryzen 7 2700X on an X470 motherboard, yet it's only 65W. Great purchase. Another satisfied Gigabyte customer. Having 2 m.2 slots is also helpful! To upgrade the WiFi card, simply remove the two screws securing the mounting bracket from the bottom of the motherboard. Swap cards, and reinstall. It\u2019s quite easy to do.",

                "reviewText": "I think this is a solid motherboard, it comes with USB 3.2, built-in Wi-Fi, and both a PCIEx4 and PCIEx1 when other motherboards double down on the PCIEx1.Those are nice but when you are like me and you put in a decently large EVGA 1070 in this you will notice that the PCIEx1 right below the PCIEx16 is blocked completely and the layout of the SATA connections is unfavorable, to say the least.This is probably only in my specific situation but the PCIEx16 is simply too close to the others below it as it blocks the x1 completely but still allows the x4 to be used with the caveat of blocking one fan from the GPU because it's still too close, I have seen other boards with the x16 just a smidge higher in order to prevent this from happening.Another disadvantage of using a GPU like the one I used is the SATA data connections, I can just barely use two of them because the rest are hidden behind the GPU and do not allow enough room for a traditional connection, I could use one of those 90-degree connections but that really doesn't do anything because they tend to bend down (I have seen one that bends to the right but I simply do not have the time to purchase and test that right now) There are other boards that have the SATA connections lined up at the very bottom of the board which does two things: prevents this specific inconvenience & allows you to tidy up the looks of the wiring if you are interested in keeping your connections much less visible.(Also if you plan on running this with integrated graphics CPU only or if you simply need to connect an HDMI directly to the motherboard, the placement of one of the antennas is directly below the HDMI port which may require the antennas to be forced into a weird position when set up)Evidently, this motherboard best pairs with the use of other smaller graphics cards that are only one fan long.",

They all knew gigabyte was a headache for people, and they figured it might be a bios issue (even though Rev 1.7 shouldn't need a bios qflash for the cpu of choice).Then we bought new ram modules and GPU in order to avoid no display bios qflashing. Switched to appropriately sized ram modules and a GeForce RTX 3060. All items confirmed compatible.Then we honed in on the fact that when we turned the computer on after connecting, all fans and lights would start up no problem, but motherboard power went into idle, AND won't shut off with a power button long press and hold.This is a sure sign that the motherboard is already messed up from the beginning.Other reasons not to buy this board or any from their brand...I have been in multiple discord groups, facebook groups, and reddit groups/threads, all with people complaining of the same issue, and nearly all of them fixing it by returning the board due to terrible installation instructions, worse bios flash instructions, and overall headache of boot issues and crashes.I did troubleshooting on this board for 6 hours a day average for nearly 10 days, including all my research time, and if i didn't care about getting my money back for another board, going with MSI, then I would climb to the top of a cell phone tower like I used to do for work and Frisbee this thing as had as I possibly could into the nearest high traffic interstate. Gigabyte is by far the absolute worst board I have ever encountered for being user friendly, instructions friendly, or ANYTHING friendly.Seriously just DONT GET THIS BOARD or ANY of their boards EVER. Pay a bit more money and get the good stuff.",

It has 1 cooling fan pin set, and 1 frame fan pin set, so I had to use a splitter to get all three fans to run on my tower\u2019s frame. The brackets to mount the board were easy to install and fasten very securely. It is made of quality material and did not flex easily when plugging in couplings. Great board for the cost!",

I plucked a 5600G in this and was expecting a full weekend of Windows reinstalls and such BS since I was replacing a 4th gen i5. Well, the freaking motherboard posted on the first boot and Windows drove all drivers after two reboots. I may have to give Microsoft some credit for this bit, hey, whatever. I updated the BIOS in five minutes and then updated to Win11 without a tragic story to tell. It worked.More anecdotal evidence? A bought a Gigabyte board because the last one worked without problems for seven years. So I bought another Gigabyte board. Incredible, heh?Wanna have some more nuanced context? Well the BIOS interface is kinda meh. The app center is awful. Guess what? I use those for a few cumulative minutes each year so I don't care.",
