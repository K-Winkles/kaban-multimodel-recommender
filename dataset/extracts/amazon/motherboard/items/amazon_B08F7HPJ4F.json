Paired with a R5-5600 and 32 GBs of DDR4-3200 I've had no issues. Under a 30 minute CPU stress test the VRMs on this board settled in at 80c with an ambient temperature of 21c while using a 120mm air cooler on the CPU. Definitely hot, but also within tolerable operating temperatures.The only reason I give this board 4 stars overall is because of the SATA placement. With a mainstream rx6600 GPU installed 2 of the 4 SATA ports are covered by the GPU. Not a deal breaker for me, but I could see someone being upset by this.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this board after finding out the one I initially bought did not have ARGB. I was looking for something affordable for my new AMD setup as I previously had an Intel set up but the opportunity arose for me to upgrade to a better AMD CPU. My case has 3 ARGB fans and 2 Corsair RGB RAM sticks so I wanted to be able to coordinate the lighting. For this price point, it is next to impossible to find a board with ARGB. I was lucky enough to stumble upon a forum that listed this as a possible option. I am glad I did. I paired this with SignalRGB and I have a coordinated setup that I am in love with.",
