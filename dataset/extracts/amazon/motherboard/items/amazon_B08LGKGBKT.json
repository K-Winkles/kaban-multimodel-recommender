The QFLED and the Q-Flash Plus button on the rear panel will flash during the BIOS matching and flashing process.

We did encounter a couple of problems while setting it up.First, there was a message about something being corrupted related to the AMD version of TPM. When we pressed the indicated keys, nothing happened.We tried rebooting the system, but the error stayer.Then we removed all power for a few seconds. When we powered it back up, it had the same error, but it DID respond to keystrokes.Next, it wouldn't boot to Linux. This was the existing install which worked OK on the old motherboard.The BIOS recognized the multiple boot failures, and suggested letting it set standard defaults. We did that, and it booted to Linux.The old Gigabyte motherboard lasted 11 years before flakiness started occurring, and I expect this will last that long, too.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this motherboard to upgrade my sons aging Intel build and bring him up to date with more modern hardware. Basically, I built him a new computer from the ground up. I opted for a Ryzen 4600G with exceptional silicon (actually boosts as high as 6100mhz for short durations). 32Gb of RAM, 1Tb Nvme main drive with a 4Tb spinning dino-drive as mass storage. Ditched the cheapo cooler the 4600G came with for something with a much higher TDP. Using a RX 6650 XT for graphics with a 1080p monitor. This does everything he wants to do. Including live-streaming gaming. He's happy, I'm happy, everybody is happy.That said, my own recent build used a Gigabyte motherboard as well. That is why I used a Gigabyte board for his build. I'm really impressed with the quality of Gigabyte recently. I have no brand loyalty at all. I look around and see who is providing what level of quality for the dollar and go with the one who offers the most bang for the buck. Recently, Gigabyte has been killing it with motherboards.",
