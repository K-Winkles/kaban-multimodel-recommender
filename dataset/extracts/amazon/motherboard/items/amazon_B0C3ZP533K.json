Hell.. even their audio makes a \"pop\" noise when your PSU doesn't have a -12V rail because they completely rely on the PSU having an OPTIONAL -12V rail for their opamp. Stupid.",

The motherboard worked for a second and then fried when power started using a little more. I got back my money but lost $20 because they have some weird hidden fee so thats where they scam you off of buying this product. Probably shipping around the same motherboard and taking $20 from everyone who buys it, horrible. Not to mention it didn't come with an I/O Shield either. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e",
