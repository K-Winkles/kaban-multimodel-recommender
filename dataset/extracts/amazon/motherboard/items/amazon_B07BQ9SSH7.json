If you build your own PC and you need to make a high performance machine on a friendly budget then this is your motherboard! First of all, the board is called Ultra Durable, and I can assure you that it is. I will certainly being going with UD again, for when I am custom building things tend to get knocked around, and I need a motherboard that can take a beating from a builder with clumsy hands. It can only handle one graphics card, so SLI is out of the question. One can always come back later and add a higher quality card like a Nvidia RTX 2060 later on down the road. It can hold up to four sticks of RAM. My thoughts: affordable, very durable, upgradable, and awesome live customer service support.",

                "reviewText": "After a series of electrical misshappens destroyed my previous board, I purchased this one, which looked inexpensive and useful enough. This is the B360M DS3H model, which I feel the need to clarify because Amazon keeps grouping up all the reviews for several different models and people don't always notice this.After pairing it up with a new CPU and RAM (my old ones were not compatible and likely just as destroyed anyway) I booted my PC up, checked the BIOS options for a bit and let the OS (Windows 7 64 bit) load. Everything went fine until I tried to move the mouse, which didn't respond, and neither did the keyboard. I knew it wasn't a problem with both devices or the board because they both ran fine at the BIOS settings.As it turns out, all the USB ports of the board, even the 2.0 ones run in a 3.0 base, and Windows 7 is incompatible with USB 3.0. I had USB 3.0 drivers installed, but they only worked with my previous board. After desperately searching for compatible drivers, I found them, installed them... and they did nothing. USB still didn't work.So yeah, I had to install Windows 10, which I was going to do anyway (already had the license ready), but I just wanted to use my PC normally for a bit before. Alas, it was not to be. A few more hours had to be waited upon.As for the board, it works fantastically. I find the performance in my software and games to be much better than before. Granted, it's hard to gauge just how much of that is the board and how much is actually the new RAM, CPU and OS (I keep the same GPU), but still, the board had no compatibility issues once W10 was installed. But, keep in mind, if you intend to keep using Windows 7, this board is not for you.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Good for budget system",
                "reviewText": "GIGABYTE B360M DS3H paired with Core i5-8400 and 2x Corsair Vengeance LPX 8GB (1 x 8GB) DDR4 DRAM 2400MHz C16 (PC4-19200) and a budget GPU Radeon 550. This machine runs our home security system, video server for all the TVs/devices in the house and the steam link and all the games for the kids. It is working very well and I am pleased with the performance and reliability of all the components I have.I'm not an advanced cpu person but I like to poke around, and given that most tech support is google I do OK, so take that into consideration when using this review.Setup: I was stripping an old 1st gen Core -i5 750 system that was filling the same roles listed above and it lasted 10 years, so the PSU, case, peripherals and drives are all old except I added a SanDisk 240 GB SSD for the OS (Win10). I have built a couple PCs in the past and this was the fastest anything went together. The entire teardown/install of new components took very little time -- maybe an hour total. I also added an Arctic Freezer 7 Pro cooler and I think that was a mistake if I ever want to use more than 2 RAM slots -- a little too big for the micro atx setup, but it is in there and working.The plate that fits over all the rear connectors and is supposed to snap into place on your case did not fit so I had to do some minor bending.I like the \"foolproof\" design this has because I am curious beyond my knowledge and have not blown anything up or melted anything yet.I did have an issue with it recognizing any bootable drives (of which I had prepared 3 just in case - SSD, HDD, USB) and the answer was essentially \"fiddle with bios settings and keep restarting.\" Good in that I couldn't really mess it up, bad in that it should have been automatic since I had done the work to have the drives all bootable with OS prior to installation.I also had an issue with the cpu fan alarm. If you do not have a fan connected to some ports on these motherboards and happen to have the settings in the BIOS for \"fan fail/stop alarm\" turned on, this alarm will sound continuously. Don't do that like I did. Drove me nuts for an hour or so whilst looking for youtube solutions.I did not buy this board for heavy gaming so I didn't care about overclocking settings. It turns out I can't overclock either the processor or the RAM since mine is already at 2400. Figuring out the processor limit was easy but the board/bios seems to indicate that I could overclock the memory -- I can't -- but it was a little misleading and clunky. Not a problem as I don't need it but as I said, I have the \"dangerously curious\" trait.I benchmark the system and get above average performance on all pieces except GPU (for obvious reasons - I think I spent $60 new) and memory. The memory keeps showing up below average for its type (which is why I was messing with settings in the first place). Dunno why even though I have the XMP dual channel turned on - and it isn't important enough to me to spend any more time with it on this system.Overall - good budget board and people complaining about wanting more, well you get what you pay for. This is one of the cheapest 8th gen boards out there (or was when I purchased) and I am happy that it does what I needed it to do.",

                "reviewText": "Excellent budget motherboard! Have had no problems with it whatsoever. For a cheap processor, like the i3-8100, this is a great motherboard to go along with it. Also, make sure you don\u2019t have a huge graphics card because it will pretty much block up the rest of the pci ports and prevent you from plugging anything else in- such as a WiFi card. I bought this board and an i3 8100 as temporary parts to use for my newly built system while I wait for the 9th gen intel processors and z390 motherboards and currently my massive gtx 1080 blocks all of the pci ports, but what else could you expect from pairing it with an matx board. Superior motherboard for its value howerever.",

                "reviewText": "I normally do not buy products with no reviews, but the price was too good to pass up. This motherboard was the cheapest one compatible with 8th gen Intel CPUs at the time of this writing. Bought for my budget build. This motherboard is only compatible with 8th generation Intel CPUs. Came well packaged in an anti-static bag. Has 4 ram slots. Install was easy and it works well. BIOS was easy to set up. Seems like good build quality. No complaints.",
