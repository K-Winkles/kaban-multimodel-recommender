                "reviewText": "Two pins in the CPU socket came broken and some were bent, I requested a refund already but the UPS in my country (Panama) doesn't work with QR code and said that the item must be shipped to the US first and that will be an additional fee of $100 minimum.I've tried taking it to different technicians to see if they can save the mobo while also looking for an affordable courier to take it back to the US every single day.So far I've only found one technician that might help me but said that it requires soldering and even that might not save the motherboard, and that it might void my warranty.I'm nearing the end of my return period and still have no way of returning this trash. Why must I pay $100 minimum to return a defective product, this thing cost me 179.99, I'm required to pay more than 50% of the product just to return it to receive my refund, which translates to me wasting an average of $100 in nothing because I'm not getting a replacement or refund until the product is sent back, which I'm definitely not doing with such insane prices to return a defective junk.",
