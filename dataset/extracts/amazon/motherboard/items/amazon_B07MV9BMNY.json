Motherboards are one place where it's really easy to overspend on features you don't actually need. ASRock comes in clutch with more than good enough products for a reasonable price.",

                "reviewText": "Was very happy with this board especially at this price.Pros:Looks goodWorks goodUefi is ok, easy to OC everythingThe vrm heatsinks are good, stays acceptably coolGood I/O selection (has USB type C, plenty of USB 3Decent audioCons:Hmmmmmmmmm....Well first, the \"polychrome\" software is CRAP, but if your savvy you will eventually get it to work. But for me I finally got everything aRGB synched, the fans, the ram, the board etc, then the very next day the boards LEDS and everything synched to it wouldn't turn on. After a semi competent conversation with asrock, it seems the RGB controller itself is no longer working, so I no longer am able to sync anything and the Mobo lights just don't work. CRAP. JUST AFTER WARRANTY.If you use the lower of the two M.2 slots (the SATA one), be aware it shares it's SATA lane with SATA port #3, so you cannot plug an SSD/HDD into SATA port 3 AND have a SATA M.2 installed, it's one or the other, so if you plan to use that m.2 port you effectively lose one of the few SATA ports. Not sure if that's on all boards or what but it's kind of lame.No wifi option, I bought a good adapter and Intel WiFi/Bluetooth m.2 card, works great ($30)This is still the best looking board at this price, however the asrock quality should be a topic of consideration if you really care about the aRGB stuff. I will have a really hard time picking asrock in the future.EDIT:SO after a year, i finally decide to try asrocks ploychrome asrrgbled cant decide on name software, and guess what. Firmware updates automatically after starting up the program, and guess what happened? Go ahead, after reading my review, guess. MOBO LIGHTS! Are back on. Check out my review on the cpu cooler ive used the entire time, its the UpHere 5v argb one, you'll see my pictures there. I highly recommend that cooler and matching case fans.I give this board a bump from 3-5 stars for full functionality. It's asrocks software that should get 1 star.",

                "reviewText": "Edit : bios options don't stick properly, will likely need an update. Ui doesn't display properly on 4k screen. Also due to the power phase design im assuming the stepping for ram voltage is pretty pathetic .05v jumps. I usually opt for higher end with more phases so I probably should have expected that on this one. Still a downside no doubt.Nice matx board with everything you need. Bought it to stick a 2600x in, works great without issue. Supports 3200mhz ballistix sport, haven't tried oc'ing but works at xmp speed.Had an issue with the polychrome argb utility, but after uninstalling then reinstalling through the app center it worked fine.Plenty of fan headers along with 2rgb and an arbg header. Huge plus on a matx board. Many of the others I looked at only had 2 fan headers.Two m.2 drives are a huge pro as I put this in a case with limited space. NOTE - the bottom m.2 is sata only and the upper one is nve only (almost sent the board back before recognizing this).I won't be using any other significant features with this board so I won't try to speak to them.Other than that it looks great, works for my needs. I actually bought this off the warehouse as they were out of New ones at the time. Was a bit worried, but didn't find anything wrong with it. I will say the ui is a bit crappy, but other than that I find it pretty difficult to find anything negative to say. I'm happy with it, if you're looking for a decent b450 this one fits the bill.",

                "reviewText": "Let's start with the the downside. The one problem I have with this motherboard is the \"second\" m.2 slot. It doesn't work unless you have a SSD plugged into one of the hard drive slots. Now this motherboard is really cool. I love the lighting and the colors on it. The black, white, and silver all mix with my black and white build. It has plenty of fan plugs, has 4 hard drive slots. The rear I/O does have some dinosaur ports but 7 USB and 1 USB C port it has plenty of room for anything you would like to plug in.(EDIT: The second m.2 slot is a SATA 3 m.2 drive. So do not buy a normal nvme.)",

Es excelente la estoy usando con un ryzen 5 3600.Edit 1: he encontrado en el bios la opci\u00f3n de apagar la iluminaci\u00f3n led cuando el equipo est\u00e1 apagado, esta en configuraci\u00f3n avanzada >configuraci\u00f3n de medios>turn on onboard LED in S5 solo basta con deshabilitar y se soluciona.",
