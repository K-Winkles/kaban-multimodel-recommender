                "reviewText": "Want a motherboard that will support a wide variety of CPU's?Like the 2600 or the 3600 or even the Ryzen 5000 (5600 5800 ect.) series?Well then this is a great choice.THOUGH you will need a CPU of a previous generation to use the 5000 series.And yes you will need to preform the BIOS update.It will not provide great overclocking nor would I recommend it for such.Though doing so may cause it to spike the temperature greatly.We know this is just Precision Boost Overdrive.This the motherboard doesn't really handle it that well.I have seen spikes up to 4200 clock speed on this 3600 and the system gets glitchy or jagging does occur.Not all the time but in certain situations but there is no real worry here.SOMETIMES with Ryzen its spiking to max all core overdrive can cause this.Though if it does concern you -then just do the following: Underclock the system.HOWEVER not the way you have heard from so many:Go into Windows power options manager and just set the min and max to 99% of the CPU utilization.This may seem erroneous but believe me when I say the system is faster...Not to mention as a side bonus it is consistently more stable.With alot less stuttering than with PBOSo this method so far alleviates that.For example the default Cinebench R20 score for a 3600 is 2802 or so.This system following the above gets a 3152 rating.On the subject of the RAM it also seems to have the widest unofficial ram support.Currently using TeamGroup Elite Plus RAMAnd though it is not listed as supported for the 3600 it seems to work just fine.This board does have a bad caveat though: Only two RAM slots.If your wanting more than 16/32 GB of RAM.You may be hard pressed to not shell out alot on the memory.",

But if you are building a bridge PC, to get you to the DDR5 era, this is a good board. You can get DDR4 components cheap right now (ram and such), we picked up a 5000 series CPU cheap, and you can put the extra money into a power supply, M.2 drive, and graphics card, you will later migrate into a new PC. By reusing a tower, keyboard, mouse and monitor, and picking up a used 8 gb 580 graphics card, we built a decent machine for about $380-$420. And the power supply, and drive will migrate to a new PC some day.",

I bought 3 ARGB fans and could not plug them in as there are no ports, so I did not have any lights.I did buy a SATA to 3 Pin ARGB adapter on Amazon that made the lights worked, but they were simply rainbow instead of having any customization (fine by me but could be a dealbreaker for some)Overall a solid starter board!",

                "reviewText": "If you don't plan on building something super hefty and powerful, this board is perfect for you.Practically came plug-n-play right out of the box, completely compatible with Win10, so while flashing the BIOS isn't necessary, I recommend a clean installation of your OS. Supports up to 32GB RAM, and the PCEIx1 card is ABOVE the 16x, meaning there's easy access for wireless cards and other optional hardware. The two USB 3.1 pinouts are also a godsend, allowing up to a total of 12 USB devices.My only two complains are very minimal; the binary shield is a little flimsy and awkward. Thankfully my PC case had grooves that allowed firm placement, but if you get a case with little to no depth in the back-panel space, I recommend using a small portion of industrial adhesive to hold it in place before aligning your board in the case. My second complaint is design of the DIMM slots, as they don't the typical spring-clamps on the bottom of each slot. Instead, they are stationary mounts that you have to slide your RAM cards in at a VERY slight angle into, pushing in the bottom half first and hearing the *click* before having to apply pressure to their top sides and visually see the top clamps come down. Factory RAM from retail PCs or used ones may get that extra *crunch* sound we all fear, so I highly recommend installing brand new cards.Aside from those very nit-picky complaints, this board has proven to be perfect for anyone not intending to install a massive amount of internal hardware. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "for an 'economy' build. The wife's computer was getting seriously bogged down by Windows 10 and it was time to upgrade my own. I got her a Ryzen 5-4600G processor (she isn't a gamer or content creator), plugged in a pair of Crucial 8Gb DDR4-3000 memory modules, a Patriot P300 1Tb SSD, a WD Blue 1Tb HDD for backup, a Seasonic Focus Gold 450W PSU, installed Windows 11, and compared to her old computer she has a screamer. Everything was straightforward and ASRock includes a useable manual. The only thing I didn't care for is the memory slots have fixed locks at one end. All else is fine, the BIOS will handle up to 5000-series AMD processors out of the box. I did have to set memory speed in BIOS using an XMP profile, it's running at 2933 MHz ( not 'overclocked').",

                "reviewText": "I chose this motherboard because it was cheap and supports most Ryzen CPU\u2019s. I went with an RSRock B450 motherboard and the Ryzen 7 3700x CPU that has a Cooler Master Wraith setup. Low end video card since I don\u2019t use a PC for gaming, mostly media applications and home theater so I went with Gigabyte Nvidia GEForce 1030 2 GB Ram silent (no fan, but a large enough heat sink) that supports HD audio for Atmos, DTS, etc. Also installed 16 GB of Corsair Vengeance DDR4 Ram and clocked it to 3200 MHz from the stock setting of 2133 MHz. So far it is a very impressive system, lots of power. I will be adding a 1 TB M.2 as the HDD 3.5\u201d regular hard drive is just a bit slow to load as data transfers are so much faster with SSD. This was my first build ever, took me about 2 hours to get everything hooked up and it booted right up. Excellent board, could not be happier with the end result!",

Usb ports on the stiff side otherwise good little board. Not using additional graphics and not used for oc but option to do both if required. Memory will only work at 2933 MHz and that has to be selected in the bios. This is the limit of the processor I believe otherwise excellent budget board.",
