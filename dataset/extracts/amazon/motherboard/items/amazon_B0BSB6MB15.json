                "reviewText": "Notched one star out of \"Tech Support\" for this M/B not shipping with a packet of bolts that secure board to a case. This should not be a problem if you do a M/B upgrade and retain those bolts after removing old M/B. Still, why would company that sells a M/B ships me a SATA cable for a drive that is not part of the deal, but fails to supply bolts for the M/B that it actually does sell? I had an all new build and had to scramble to find correct bolts.Otherwise board is good, no problems installing it and most drivers came straight from Win 11. I only had to run Intel INF installer on top of it.In fact this M/B was my second choice, but the first choice board from MSI had a problem getting GPU card initialized, going into a boot cycle half way into POST. I always considered MSI a good brand, but now I wonder how much of a QA they do these days. Installing M/B just to find that it is defective is quite a pain, considering CPU/fan/paste shenanigans involved. I say, spend extra $20 and get this board instead. Just make sure you have those bolts lined up for installation.",

                "reviewText": "When I received the motherboard, I did a visual inspection and I was proud to say there was nothing wrong. However, once I took off the CPU socket cover there was 2 bent pins. I didn\u2019t want to return the board seeing that I wanted the computer built quickly, so I used my tiny needle nose pliers to straighten the pins. I have had no problems with the CPU or the socket pins damaging my CPU. When I went to install the M.2, I could not unscrew it. I\u2019m not sure if it is a machine or hand tightened when assembled, but I have used every method I know and could find but to no avail. I have used the 2nd M.2 slot instead. I think for the price I was expecting something with a bit more quality than what I got. I haven\u2019t had any performance issues with it, but it is frustrating to have to straighten pins and have a M.2 slot screw stuck in the screw mount.",
