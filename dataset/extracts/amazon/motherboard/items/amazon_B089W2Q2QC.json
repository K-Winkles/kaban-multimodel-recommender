                "reviewText": "Nice build quality and features, but has a few design-related issues and had a couple software issues at launch (since fixed).The LAN would intermittently disable itself and had to have the device cycled through Windows to get it working again, which was fixed after a couple months through a BIOS update. More recently I discovered that the second M.2 slot for whatever reason causes electrical interference when in use to the front audio header, causing an annoying whine to speakers or headsets connected to it if your hearing is fine enough to catch it.From an aesthetic point of view it looks great, but the rear IO shield logo is partially obstructed by a normal-size rear exhaust fan. If you really want it displayed, make sure you have a slim fan back there or forgo one entirely. The chipset/M.2 cover will also be obscured by just about any graphics card. Its RGB control works fine. The logo and cover RGB don't power off with the system, only with the power switch flipped.Though I had my issues with it as an early adopter, I now recommend this if you're looking towards getting some of the X570's features but saving a bit of money.",
