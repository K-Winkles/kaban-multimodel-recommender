                "reviewText": "Great value for $110-ish! It supports 3 onboard connections to 3 monitors (HDMI, DisplayPort, and VGA), with an APU such as Ryzen 7 5700G. HDMI is 2.1, but DisplayPort is only 1.2, so check on your monitor's resolution. The motherboard comes with BIOS version 7C95vH8, so the BIOS does not need to be updated to support Ryzen 7 5700G. Version 7C95vH0 and above supports this CPU/APU.It supports up to 8 SATA storage devices, so it's great for future expansion on HDD or SSD. It works perfectly with a case like Phanteks Eclipse G500A (This case also provides front panel type-C USB connector to this board). Note that the M.2_1 slot support Gen3 PCIe SSD, unless your CPU/APU supports Gen4. Practically there is not much difference between Gen3 and Gen4 PCIe SSD anyways for either gaming or daily use. The compatibility list on the MSI website was last updated on FEB 2023, and the tech support is not very helpful on finding anything other than that list. The newer versions of DRAM should mostly be compatible, and you just have to plug them in and see if they pass the onboard EZ LED light debug checking sequence at booting. If so, then your DRAM is good to go.Caution: Do NOT install the B550 chipset drivers through the MSI Centre prompt! If you do it, it will mess up your system and make it not bootable. Then you'd have to restore the system to the last recovery point. Just go with the drivers on the MSI website (and the AMD website for your CPU/APU), and you are good to go.",

This program is insanely hard to navigate, and most people can't get past the terms and conditions. (You have to read it for continue to light up). The consensus is that it's junk but can't vouch past the terriible intro.OR, you can install Dragon Center. I went this route and it was pretty painless (search auto for drivers, install drivers, done). Just be careful not to update BIOS from dragon center or MSI center.. this has been known to cause problems on MSI motherboards. Always flash from a USB to be safe",

This motherboard was fairly cheap and an upgrade so I went with it. Having built-in Bluetooth and WiFi is nice, it saved from having to use adapters.Installation was very easy but I'm disappointed at how low quality the IO shield is compared to my previous board, which had padding and was colored so you could see all the labels. The USB 3.0 header looked crooked but still works. The main M.2 slot gave me some issues with my boot drive not being detected. I thought at first that my drive had died but it would work in an enclosure. It would also work if I didn't use the heatsink. Turns out that the screw for the heatsink needed to be installed somewhat loose or it would bend the stick. After figuring that out, the drive was detected.I was able to boot into Windows without reinstalling and immediately got prompted to download some MSI drivers, which was convenient. Make sure to remember to remove the old motherboard's software and drivers.",

No brainer upgrade for me. The heat sinks look a little more functional as well and there is even one for the nvme drive. I'm not an overclocker and actually prefer a small undervolt for my amd CPUs and I just use xmp, so I can't comment on how it handles overclocking. Great board for a mid to high end build, though.",

Have never had an issue with MSI and love their entire product line! Very easy to install, and very easy to add components. Was gaming in no time!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m happy with this card. Everything works. Wifi is a bit tricky to activate, spent 2 hours figuring it out. I\u2019ll save you some time. Basically what you have to do is initially connect to internet via Ethernet cable. From there download MSI Centre. Go to Support tab and then to Live Update. It will then list all the drivers that you\u2019re missing (wifi, Bluetooth etc). Click update and you got your wifi",

                "reviewText": "I have a love/hate relationship with this mobo. Once it\u2019s set up, it works like a dream!It comes with a very basic BIOS which doesn\u2019t allow it to operate much at all. To get it up and running, you need to install the latest version of BIOS from a flash-drive. That means that you have to have access to a working computer that you can use to download the latest BIOS onto a flash-drive before you can upload it onto the mobo. It was a complicated process for this novice, but now that I\u2019ve done it, not so very difficult after all!The next problem was that the mobo won\u2019t access my old HDD\u2019s because it operates UEFI protocol. According to the manual, which I had to download onto my phone (!), the protocol can be switched to accept other versions, but my initial attempts have been unsuccessful. I therefore had to download Windows onto a flash-drive, via another computer, and upload it onto the mobo.Because the mobo is cutting-edge, it has 2 iSSD ports. I had bought a 1TB iSSD as part of the build and the installation was fairly straightforward, but fiddley.And now the \u2018love\u2019 bit!!! The build powers up in 15 seconds and powers down in 5 seconds. The in-built WiFi works well, even though one of the antennae is loose - I\u2019d have to take the mobo out of the case to tighten the nut!Although I\u2019ve not given it a stern test, it performs all the ordinary tasks effortlessly and shows every sign that it could allow my R5 CPU to fly!!!One last thing; the BIOS for this board isn\u2019t on the MSI UK list - you have to get it from the MSI US list!!! As I said at the start - a love/hate relationship!!!",
