That case has two USB 3.0 19/20 pin header cables and this board only has one header :( even my older Prime B660M-A D4 has two usb 3.0 headers. But this case has 3 m.2 slots so I used one for a m.2 USB 3.0 Header card.The MSI software is less invasive than Asus, or Gigabyte, also the BIOS is pretty easy to deal with.There is a fair amount of available high speed approved ram if you search, but my first set of approved X-DATA 6400mhz RAM had a bad stick. Trying Patriot 7000mhz next.It's a fine mATX board, I would prefer this over any ASUS. Also looks good with my MSI GPU.",

It did not go into to boot screen, so I restarted and went into bios. Sometimes I could get into bios and sometimes I could not. No matter what I did, it would not boot to a drive. Not a hard drive or a DVD drive. I trouble shot the memory, no difference. I removed to boot drive and replaced with three different hard drives and it still would not boot to a drive so I could install an operating system. I have built dozens of computers and never had this problem. So I tore it down and returned it. On a good point, I was reimbursed the full amount. On a side note, I got a different board and it is installed and happily running windows 11. It was definitely a bad motherboard.",
