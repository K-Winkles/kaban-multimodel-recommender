What I'm appreciative of is the tech support from amazon and Asrock. I couldn't get my board on first hands on, I couldn't get it to work no matter what I tried(I've been building my own pc's over 20 years). I contacted Amazon and they took me through several possible fixes that didn't help. Amazon rma'd the board with no problem. I had a couple of issues with the replacement board, but Asrock tech dept. worked w me till I got the board going, they even offered to warranty the board. At the last moment, I decided to take out the motherboard battery and reset it, then clear cmos, everything worked fine after that little trick. I like the board, this is the 3rd Asrock board that I've owned, the first was an AMD AM2 board. No one wants a board that wont boot, has issues, but Amazone and Asrock tech dept. pulled this one out for stellar support. As for an Asrock board, this probably wont me my last. Thank you Asrock and Amazon.",

                "reviewText": "The good news is that I got lucky and got a board with a 1.80 bios, which allowed me to boot to SETUP and update the bios to version 1.90, which is the version that I know works with this board. It's a good, quick board but the downside is that it doesn't work with Windows 7 so if you're expecting to use 7 forget it. You can't install it on this ASRock board without some pretty complicated \"slipstreaming\" stuff to add the necessary USB 3.0 drivers to make it work. Also, This particular motherboard doesn't support Windows 7 drivers, anymore, but you can install an aftermarket video card like nVidia and still get Windows 7 drivers for it so it's really good that way. All in all, it's not a bad board. It's good and fast and I think everyone likes that.",

It plays nice with all the other components I have and could fit in just about any case. Buying it though, you should plan on upgrading. It only has two DDR4 RAM slots and one PCIe x16. If you\u2019re just going to use your pc casually, then it\u2019s a great, it could even handle light gaming. It also doesn\u2019t have a wifi card so that paired with only two slots of RAM convinced me to upgrade after using this board for three years.",

                "reviewText": "This board was such a pain in the butt to get working and I made sure all the parts were compatible with PCPartPicker first, as I did not need incompatibilities creating an unknown variable.TROUBLESHOOTING:I ran into an issue with a lack of output to the display... At first, I thought it didn't support the 5700G CPU I had, but then I realized that P2.10 was the BIOS installed and it should support it. However, It wasn't showing any video with the internal GPU or with the Graphics Card I had installed (AMD 6600 XT)... I even went as far as purchasing a Ryzen 3 3100 to flash the firmware to a newer version, but even that CPU wasn't displaying any output! I had no beeps indicating there was an issue (Yes I installed a speaker and tested it by removing the RAM and it certainly recognized that). In addition to this, the CPU, Case, and GPU fans all had power, so that wasn't an issue either.I began to search for others having a similar issue and found a few posts where people were using CPUs showing as supported with all motherboard versions and still not producing any output. One guy said he couldn't get it to display anything with the HDMI port on either his video card or his Motherboard with an integrated GPU (That's extremely poor design and testing of this product).Armed with new information, I tried a Display Port cable and unfortunately, my Grandson was \"Helping\", in between text messages to friends (this is his computer)... Apparently, he didn't think it was okay to leave the DP cable plugged into the Monitor at the same time as the HDMI cable and as soon as I figured out what he did, we finally had video output with the Discrete GPU.The real problem here is that the board should poll each video connection and try to get a signal, yet this was the only board I've ever owned that didn't do this. If the board polled the ports, there wouldn't have been any guessing games about why I had no video and no beep codes telling me something wasn't right.Even more, the AMD 550 and 570 chipsets both support BIOS Flashback for updating the BIOS without a CPU installed, and yet these motherboard makers decided that should be reserved for their high-end products only (Asrock and Asus both do this and it's dumb), so they never implemented it. They knew this was an issue with AMD CPU support when they made these boards and still they decided you didn't need the feature.VALUEThe big selling point is that you can support 5000 series CPUs and NVME drives. Unfortunately, they skimped on so many other areas that their only value is these two items.This board lacks a USB-C Header or USB-C Port, It only has two RAM slots, a single x1 PCIe slot, and a single x61 PCI-E slot, and there's only support for a single case fan and CPU fan, so that's not great either. For $20 to $30 more their competitors give you most of the features this board is missing and they likely work without all the hassle. I've had some very nice AsRock boards in the past, but this one is an extreme disappointment for an ATX board.GAMINGYes, it will work for gaming, but limited fan headers mean the only way to power some of the fans would be a straight plug to the power supply and that will give you zero control over the cooling speeds and noise levels. I could see mid to higher-end cards and CPUs throttling with this setup.OVERALLIt's a cheap, no-frills motherboard that allows you to use 5000 series CPUs and supports faster RAM. Had I known what a hassle it would be to work around its flaws, I might have just paid the difference and purchased a slightly higher-end model.Am I keeping the board? Well, now that we got it working, we will stick with it, but hopefully, this helps other people make their decision when buying 550 series motherboards.",

I can't believe people complain about features, they know what they are getting, why rate it for what it don't have and know ahead of time? That makes no sense to me. All Micro ATX boards have two slots, there is just not enough room for more, why would someone complain about that?Anyway, very easy setup, Pop OS works great in it with my AMD Ryzen 3 3200G. I got this for my media PC upgrade.",
