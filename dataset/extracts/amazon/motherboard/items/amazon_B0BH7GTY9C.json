                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Phenominal Motherboard!",
                "reviewText": "Phenomenal Bang for the buck and worth the extra cost over the B650 Aorus Elite Ax.No issues at all, Shipped with an older F4 Bios but the Voltages were within the AMD 1.3v tolerance even for an older bios.Flashed Bios to the latest 8c Revision. Everything works on the 8c Revision just can no longer save custom fan curves to the bios itself but you can save them to a Flash drive or use the Gigabyte Software and save them in windows itself.VRM Temps are amazing, As are the M.2 SSD temps, I didn't opt to put in a PCie Gen 5 SSD in the top slot because the price to performance isn't worth it for what I do at the moment So I opted for a Samsung 980 Pro 2 TB drive and it runs at a cool 38c under load in that Beefy Heatsink that comes with Thermal pads for both sides of the M.2 drive. \"Ez latch\" system works great but there's no mention on HOW to use it at all I had to YouTube it. For those wondering you push down the end of the Plastic \"Ez Latch\" retainer and it'll slightly pop up allowing you to insert the M.2 Then push down the popped up end lock it in place. The board also comes with Traditional M.2 Retention screw and posts for those that want to remove the \"Ez Latch\" system.The Highlight of my experience was the Front Panel Connector adapter \"G Connector\" that came in the package so much easier just slot the cables in the adapter and slide it into the front Panel connector pins on the board.Memory Training was Quick and Easy only waited about ~20 ish seconds for the first boot on the Older F4 Bios for the board to Memory Train on a G.Skill 64 MB Flare X5 6000 M/T CL30-40-40-96 Kit. After the 8c Bios Update Training times reduced, for those Ram Overclockers out there.Onboard sound, sounds great only wish it had the Traditional 5 ports on the back instead of the Optical input or Like some other boards 5 ports + Optical Input.Apparently the Gigabyte B650 Aorus Elite AX boards had issues with Coil whine, I can confirm that is NOT an issue at all with the Gigabyte Aorus Pro Ax board.Also too Apparently the Intel 2.5 G Ethernet chip had problems or people are warning about that too, In my research the issues were on Intel Chipset Motherboards and not the AMD Chipset boards, and from personal experience Windows 11 already had a perfectly good working driver but I wanted the latest driver so I Just went to the Offical Gigabyte website downloaded and installed the latest Drivers No issues at all with the 2.5 G Ethernet port under the Intel Controller on this model.The board does weigh a good Bit given all the Heatsink and metal armor heat dissipation it comes with.Also For those that Don't read the Motherboard Manual online - The Bottom PCIe 4 x 4 Slot Gets DISABLED if you Populate the 3rd M.2 Drive Slot on the board. Personally this isn't an issue for me but for those of you running a Capture Card or a Thunderbolt Card in the slot Just know you CAN'T use the 3rd M.2 Slot. So given this make sure you get Big Enough Drives for your first 2 M.2 Slots!The Aorus Logo on the I/o Shield / VRM Heatsink Does Light up and is addressable RGB just have to install the GIgabyte Control Center to adjust it. The board does come with 4 Basic Troubleshooting LED's about Mid board and has a nice manual power button on the board itself for testing and Troubleshooting. I only wish it had a 8 Segment Display like its more Expensive B650E and X670E Brethren.Working with this Motherboard was a lot easier then others I've worked with in the Past.Also too the Gigabyte Control Center Software does come with a lot of the other Drivers and Patches you'll need so for those looking to do less and want to use the Gigabyte Control Center anyway just download that first and download the other drivers as needed afterwards.Full System Build:B650 Aorus Pro AXNoctua NH-U12A Chromax BlackNoctua NA-STPG1 - Thermal Paste GuardNoctua NM-AMB15 - AMD AM5 7mm Offset Mounting BracketsRyzen 7 7700XCorsair RM1000e PSUG.Skill Flare X5 64 GB 6000 M/T CL 30-40-40-96 Ram KitSamsung 980 Pro 2TB M.2 SSD3x Corsair ML140 Fans (Front Case)2x Corsair ML120 Fans (Blowing Air Into GPU)Re-positioned 2x Lian Li 140mm Fans to Top of the CaseMSI RTX 2070 TRI FROZR (Already had from Previous build)Gigabyte M27Q-P 1440p 27\" 165 Hz Gaming Monitor.Motherboard Box Includes:Motherboard nicely packaged in Anti Static plastic bagWifi Antenna2 Pin Pickup that can be used to adjust your fans based off of Internal case Noise DBA.

Thermal Temps are great and has an insanely Robust and overkill 16+2+1 90A Power Stages with 8mm Heatpipe vs Others at 75A or lower stages and 6mm Heatpipes. Picked this because I got Tired of Waiting for the B650E Aorus Master to come back in stock and I don't believe in paying Scalpers their $100 - $200 dollar inflated prices.I know it was Long but I hope it helps someone make a better decision and pick up an amazing motherboard.",

                "reviewText": "This review is for the GIGABYTE B650 AORUS Elite AX rev 1.I ordered this board because I was on an older Intel platform and I wanted to try an AMD build again. The AMD AM5 platform suits my needs since it has current modern features and is projected to have a long lifecycle and I anticipate my next upgrade to be in 5 years or so.The GIGABYTE B650 AORUS Elite AX was one the lesser expensive and full featured ATX boards with WiFi at the time of my purchase.My build includes:GIGABYTE B650 AORUS Elite AX MotherboardAMD Ryzen 7700X CPUCorsair Vengeance RGB RAMZotac GTX 1080 AMP EditionFirst, my dislikes. No printed manual. As a lifelong pc builder, I rely heavily on a manual booklet for basic info such as what slots to install memory in. How to connect front panel power, reset, hdd status led etc. Where all of the headers such as USB and fans are located.Having an online manual is good but is useless if you don't have a spare computer or laptop to use while you build your computer.Thankfully I did not have to use the BIOS flashback feature because the board recognized my CPU, a Ryzen 7700X, otherwise I would have to go online, download the manual and look up the flashback instructions.For the price I do wish that the board included a higher end integrated audio chipset. Features-wise the audio chipset is the biggest disappointment.I did not like is the top most NVME slot right above the GPU slot has a really thick thermal adhesive pre-applied to the heatsink. It is so thick that it bends my NVME drive slightly - not enough to cause any issues but should be noted.One last thing I did not like is the lack of onboard BIOS post code status LED. I had this feature on my previous motherboard and found it super helpful when diagnosing problems.Now, for my likes. I like all of the features. AM5 socket, DDR5, WiFi6, PCIe 5.0, multiple NVMe slots, plenty of USB slots, and of course RGB support. The board itself is great. Build quality is awesome, no issues with build quality or materials.I did run into a few issues though. Although these issues were encountered with this motherboard, they are not Gigabyte's fault necessarily. These issues were mostly to do with the AMD platform and chipset itself.1. The shipping BIOS \"F2\" version did not allow me to enable XMP memory profile. I had to flash the BIOS to the current at the time \"F4\" BIOS.Note that the current BIOS version as of this review is \"F5a\".2. There were a lot of stability or problems with the USB chipset or bus. File transfers over USB were very slow or slower than it should be. I have USB DAC that had a lot of noise during audio playback. These issues were resolved by installing the latest chipset drivers for the B650 from AMD directly and also updating the BIOS.Here are some recommendations based on my experience with the GIGABYTE B650 AORUS Elite AX.Definitely update the BIOS. In past generations of motherboards it is only recommended to update the BIOS to fix a specific issue you've encountered. However, in modern motherboards there are so many chipsets and features that it is important to keep up to date on BIOS versions to maintain stability, performance, compatibility, and security. AMD seems to release AGESA updates (as BIOS updates) often and this is directly tied to the chipset. Also, download the chipset drivers directly from AMD because they tend to be more up to date than the motherboard manufacturers' website.To flash the bios, just download the BIOS file for your motherboard from Gigabyte's website and extract/copy the file to a USB drive. Reboot and enter the bios and choose Q-Flash. Select the BIOS, and the board will load the BIOS to memory then prompt for a reboot and apply the new BIOS.Aside from the chipset drivers, all other motherboard drivers can be downloaded and installed from Gigabyte.Ever since, updating the BIOS and AMD chipset drivers, I have had absolutely zero issues. Performance is amazing. Stability is solid. I even run a mild overclock using the AMD Ryzen Master app and doing an auto-oc.In summary, I highly recommend the GIGABYTE B650 AORUS Elite AX if you're looking for an AM5 build. The issues I've had are specific to the AMD platform and not the motherboard itself, however because of this I would not recommend the AMD platform for novice PC builders or if you are not comfortable or familiar with BIOS updates and troubleshooting driver issues.",
