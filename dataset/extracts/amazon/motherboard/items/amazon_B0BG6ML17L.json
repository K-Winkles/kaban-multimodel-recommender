                "reviewText": "What I found out that may be helpful is if you use XMP function in the bios you can only use 2 dimm slots and with this ddr4 version of mobo you are maxed at ddr4 3200. It won't boot with xmp on and 4 dimm slots in use. I had 4 ddr4 3200 ram and they were running at 2100 when i looked in bios and everything booted and worked great. Well I went to turn xmp on to achieve the 3200 speed they were rated at and the mobo was rated for and the computer wouldn't post. After research I found you can only use 2 of the dimm slots if you are using xmp. After going to 2 dimm and xmp on everything was great again. My previous asus mobo (older 2017 chipset) I took these ram from did great with these 4 dimms and xmp on so it's a quirk of this mobo. It still is a great value and you can easily just put 2 32gig ddr4 3200 and be fine.I was trying to reuse old ram so I bought this ddr4 version and I may have just upgraded to the ddr5 mobo instead if I knew my ram wouldn't work as i had intended. I'll never use that much ram anyways so it worked out luckily for me otherwise I'd be upset if id bought 4 dimms for this board and couldn't use xmp. Hopefully this saves some poor soul time and money.",
