However, the side without a latch wasn't in all the way.Check especially carefully the RAM slots if you have a solid RED CPU diagnostic light and solid YELLOW DRAM light, at least, that was my issue.",

                "reviewText": "So one of the things I knew better to do was to skimp out on a motherboard. I was building a PC within my girls budget so I gave it a shot. There is just so many things about this board that is bad. For 1, the bios did not recognize my mice or keyboards. I say that plural because i tried 3 of each in multiple different usb ports. After some research I read alot of msi boards still need to resort to PS/2 technology in their bios which is tech I haven't seen used in over a decade. So i was unable to use the XMP profile on the ram without ordering ps/2 to USB adapters. Problem number 2, it has no wifi. No big deal, ill add a PCI-e x1 wifi card. Actually, you cant because a 2 slot GPU covers the slot. Problem number 3, A case front USB 19 pin header interferes with GPU fans because your X16 slot is so low on the motherboard. The fan was rubbing on the wire and i had to jam a 12mm socket between my GPU and my bottom mounted power supply to try to force clearance of that wire which only kinda worked. Basically this motherboard resulted in my needing to do several returns to amazon due to the poor design. I returned the motherboard, the pci-e wifi card, and a GPU support bracket because it didn't solve the rubbing on wire issue. At the end of the day, i spent the same amount of money of all 3 items on a different board that solved every problem i had. The gpu slot was higher up on the board, the x1 port was not covered by gpu, there is no fan rubbing anymore and it came with alot more luxuries than this board did. Do yourself a favor and save yourself from a headache and double your budget for the motherboard so youre not tearing your new pc apart to gut the motherboard out and then having to rebuild it again because you skimped out. If your building a pc with integrated graphics just for schoolwork or something , sure this motherboard will do that ok.",
