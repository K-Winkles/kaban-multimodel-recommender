Crucial 5600 only runs at 4800 no matter what BIOS setting.No complaints, this is a high value product that covers all the basics. My system runs this mobo 24/7 as a server with great stability.",

It is mini-ITX and has no WiFi and has an Intel NIC for use as WAN or OPT1, depending on your build. It is as Spartan as you can get, which is perfect. The build quality is very good. The UEFI BIOS is not as good as Asus, but good enough to get this job done. It has support for DDR5, which seems to be a rarity in a board of this level. It paired well with the Intel X710 NIC. I would definately recommend if you need a no frills board for a project like this.",

                "reviewText": "Not worth the price sold. Cheap and looked like it was used. Not even going to bother to power on and test. USB 3.2 pins looked damaged. System fan pins also looked damaged. Returning...Ultimately, this product should not be worth more than $110 CAD after taxes.I made the mistake of buying this. I hope this review helps others NOT choose this.I my experience now Gigabyte is not worth the trouble and this was the last time I look to use any Gigabyte Product(s).Moving to MSI MAG B760. About $50 more than this and is an ATX not Mini-ATX. Was really hoping for a good Mini-Atx but gigabyte has failed me for the last time.",
