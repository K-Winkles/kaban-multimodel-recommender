                "reviewText": "These are my notable experiences when putting this in a silent gaming build with an M.2 HD, 16 GB RAM, an AMD 200GE CPU, and Linux as the OS.UPDATE: I upgraded the system by installing Ryzen 9 3900X and a NVIDIA 1650 Super, both with stock cooling. The components were able to work without a hitch and caused no change to the stability of the system. This was quite impressive, and the only question which remains is longevity - but I have high expectations.The BIOS utility was not intuitive, even installing Windows 8.1 requires some hoops because legacy USB keyboard support is an issue. EZ mode and UEFI were mostly useless. Documentation was grammatically correct but barebones.The M.2 drive requires particular BIOS settings to enable or the board simply will not recognize the disk. Updating the firmware was painless, security was adequate, and the clocks and voltages are simple. Hardware installation was uncomplicated. Overall this board has great value and a wide range of supported configurations once you coax the BIOS.",

Throw in 2 sticks of PC3200 RAM and a cheap M2 SSD and you've got a very powerful miner for cheap. When building a CPU mining rig you don't need 6+ PCI-E slots, fancy sound or \"super speed ethernet.\" you need stable. If using a Ryzen CPU you'll need a GPU. I recommend this one: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AZHOX5K/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Cheap, fanless, gets the job done. Very happy with this little motherboard.",
