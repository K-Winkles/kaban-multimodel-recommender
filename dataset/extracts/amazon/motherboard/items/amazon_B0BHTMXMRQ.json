                "reviewText": "Gaming X Z790 AX DDR5 REVIEW:UPDATE: I now have 2 of these motherboards, one on my primary system and one on my Backup/media server. Picked up a 14700k and some other new parts. You can see how fast the NVME is and I uploaded a few more bench marks for those interested. The best bench listed not only has the 14700k but also a 3070 ti. I have only used Gigabyte MBs for over 10 years and continue to. Yes, I use these everyday and have for a long time. Even went with 64 gig of 7200 ram on my media sever. Everything works great.Not sure why all the bad reviews. This thing rocks. I have I7 13700k, 96 Gig of DDR5 ram 6400 x CL32 not even on compatibility list, 3060 GPU and a screaming NVME. The only thing is the M2 slot is PCIE4 not 5.I updated the BIOS before upgrading which I always do. I would have gotten the version without the AX but that was all that was available. Even the built in WiFi works great on my AX router without the antennas attached. the BT is awesome as well, I no longer need my BT dongle as the board has built in BT. Maybe I just got lucky? but I only use Gigabyte. Its my favorite brand.ORIGINAL REVIEW:After even more research I decided to do another upgrade to DDR5 and as a result the Z790 Motherboard. The Z690 Rocks as indicated in the other review and I migrated that board and RAM to my media server. A bit overkill for my Media server but it should last me a few years.With DDR5 prices coming down and supposed benefits I decided to migrate to the Z790. As expected my GPU and Hard drive benchmarks did not change, However my 13700k CPU benchmark has increased from the 45000 range with the Z690 to 49000-51000 with the new Z790.Overall, I am going to recommend the Z790 over the Z690 with or with out DDR5, I will also suggest using DDR5 unless you have some great DDR4 as I did. I had to get some mediocre 5600 CL 28 DDR5 Ram for testing and was able to achieve as good or better performance over my High end DDR4 3600 cl16.Another important note is both boards support 12th gen, 13th gen and the 13th gen refresh which will be the 14th gen processors. There are a few new features/changes on the Z790 BIOS that stand out. There are some additional items you can change like a DDR5 low latency toggle which dropped my latency from around 40 down to 35, also due to speed of the DDR5 RAM, you can only choose Gear 2 or Gear 4. I had trouble testing Gear 4 and had to reset my BIOS. The overall control in the BIOS is great for normal operation as well as anyone wanting to OC.The other big change is Gigabyte has introduced the Control Center overr the older App center/ The new Control center puts RGB fusion, Some OC features, Fan features and most of the App center items into the main Control Center. I can not find the @BIOS utility so I sed the QFlash in Bios for upgrading the BIOS. I also can not find th equivalent of the SIV utility which shows all of your temps on a single screen. The RGB fusion update works like the older RGB Fusion 2. With the Z790. you do have to upgrade to the newer Control Center and cant use the older apps or RGB Fusion.My overall Bench only increase by 2-300 points but the CPU benchmark is the part that stands out. The only images above from the new MOBO is showing the Benchmarks with the CPU highlighting the 49k and the RAM spec of 4346. No it wasnt that fun, replacing the MB, redoing cableing, HDs and redoing the AIO, BIOS but it only took me a couple hours because all of the cabling was in the same spot.Its hard to beat the Gaming X Z690 DDR4, but this newer Z790 DDR5 edges it out for performance. Cant wait to get some higher performance DDR5. Added a couple system benchmarks pics",

Constant driver issues, keyboard stops working, mouse and screen freeze, sound will stop. What fixes all of these issues every time is unplugging them and replugging them. Ive uninstalled all the drivers, reinstalled them, all drives are up to date. ALL of the equipment I am having issues with is equipment I used on my previous rig before building this new PC.I could reformat my old PC and boot it up, install a graphics driver and be good to go. It's been nothing but issues since I bought this MOBO for my new build.Bluetooth headset driver issues, sound stops working, sound starts crackling in gamesKeyboard randomly stops working (same keyboard I used with old system with never an issue)Random lag spikes with mouse not working..God forbid I ever have to reformat this harddrive and start over, it's going to take me a week to get the computer to run in a stable manner. I'm seriously considering sending this MOBO back and getting a different one.",
