I'm autistic and tactile sensitive, so I was happy to discover that these pens were velvety smooth. The ink doesn't seem to smear and the flow is nearly perfect. My only critique about the pen is that the little ball bearing in the clip actually can come out if you're prone to fidgeting with it. But it snaps back in no problem. I foresee myself owning this set with no ball bearings in the future. 10/10 Would buy again.",

I work in a laboratory and there are a few specifications I must follow for pens - black ink and no pen caps! These fit the bill... Also they are super cute pastel colors, they click nice and have a soft ergonomic grip. They write smooth but they sometimes \"skip\" when writing, thus the 4 star instead of 5 star rating but it's not enough of an issue/ doesn't happen frequently enough that would make me not want to order them again. Overall, nice pen for a good price! \ud83d\udc4d",

                "reviewText": "I'd definitely recommend these for anyone who's really particular about their pens! The aesthetic is very clean and it writes wonderfully. The weight of the pen is such a subtle component that I think is really what sets it apart from a lot of the pens I've used. Packaging is really wonderful too.Only taking one star as if you're used to a grip or some other design, there will be a degree of discomfort which I imagine will go away with time. I have a callus building up along the inside of my finger that is making it a bit uncomfortable to write with for extended periods of time. Not a deal breaker by any means but important to note if those sort of things affect you.",
