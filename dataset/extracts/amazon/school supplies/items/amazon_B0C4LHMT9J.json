                "reviewText": "I am an old artist and my favorite medium is pencils. Consequently, I am very picky about the pencils I use. While I have settled on Berol Prismacolors, I am not going to put that much money into the pencils of my 7 year old niece though I don't want to give her trash, either. I chose these for the range of colors and the cost for the set. I did check reviews to make sure they weren't garbage. These are very nice pencils with good color coverage, many options, and quality leads with high pigment. However, as happens with all soft core pencils, even the expensive ones, they are easy to break when sharpening. The niece has not learned the wrist trick to keep this from happening, but that took me years to master. Until then, the broken lead frustration is real. But again, that is not something that is to these pencils alone, just soft core leads. For the cost and the number of pencils you get in this set, this is a good value and a great starting set! Definitely good for beginners and very giftable. Recommended!",
