                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Really happy with this set",
                "reviewText": "I purchased the Four Candies Pastel Mechanical Pencil Set - 6PCS 0.5 mm & 0.7 mm & 0.9 mm Cute Mechanical Pencils with 360PCS HB Lead Refills, 3PCS Erasers and 9PCS Eraser Refills, Led Pencils Mechanical for Writing.I am not a fan of mechanical pencils because they seem to frustrate me after minimal use...lead breakage, can't figure out how to reload, eraser is junk, etc. However, the lack of sharpeners in classrooms has kind-of forced my hand to purchase another set. I hate the little sharpeners for regular pencils because it never fails that at some point it explodes little led and wood shavings all over my bag.The items shifted a bit during shipping but overall came adorably packaged like the picture. I love how the pencils and matching led are color coordinated and they come with a matching block eraser for each set. Love that! All the colors are beautiful, perfectly, pastel colors! The price point for everything that came in the set is amazing. Nothing in this set feels cheaply made. These are so pretty and came with all of the extras that I might need to get me through this semester. There are 2 pencils in every color and led size.For me they are perfect and so much better than I could have hoped for! They are comfortable to write with. They feel more like a pen than a pencil in my hand, which I like. They come in 3 different led sizes: 0.5mm (pink), 0.7mm (blue), and 0.9mm (purple). The only part that made me sad is that the pink set is for 0.5mm led. I much prefer the larger led (0.9mm) but they all write nicely. Each case of led contains 60 pieces. That is 120 extra pieces of led for each size!Oh, and the erasers! They actually work! the little, tiny erasers and the block erasers! They both actually erase the pencil! In the picture attached I wrote part of a math problem, erased part of it with the block, then erased another part with the tiny pencil-top eraser. Of course, the block eraser is better but they both are acceptable. AND they give you 9 extra (pencil-top) erasers!Thankfully, my two kiddos prefer the other two led sizes, so they weren\u2019t a waste. I like these pencils so much I am taking one of the purple pencil sets (pencil and led case) to work to use and leaving the other in my pencil case for school. There is so much in this set. I can\u2019t believe it was as affordable as it was. I highly recommend this set.",

                "reviewText": "This pencil kit is super cute. The pastel colors of each pencil has matching erasers and lead holders in each color. There are two lead holders on each color for each size of lead (one in 0.7 and one in 0.5mm) since each color of pencil comes in each size. There are additional replacement eraser inserts which is nice since most mechanical pencils don\u2019t come with extras. No one likes a nubby eraser. The pencils have comfortable grips to help with that sore writers bump if you have to write for an extended time. They are pretty light weight. I tend to like a heavier pencil but they\u2019re still pretty good quality for what I paid. Overall a great value for the price.",

Another benefit i got from these pencil was the appearance. Me personally i study or do work a lot quicker when everything i have looks good and cute these pencils for example help me work a lot faster and motivate me to study. I bought these pencils for my mom and my cousin they love them every time i go to there house i see them use it. That\u2019s why i think and most people should agree that\u2019s these pencils are very good and amazing.",
