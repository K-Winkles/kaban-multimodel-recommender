They are easy for children to open and close and the spacer fits inside easily. There is an internal pocket that can hold some antihistamine tablets and an Apple AirTag (if you are like me and like to track your asthma kits). The bags are discrete enough for your child who is probably reaching the self-carry age right around the same time they become very self-conscious about carrying a bag that screams medical supplies.",
