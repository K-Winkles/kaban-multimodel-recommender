There is something so satisfying about a new stack of colorful sticky notes, as if just owning them makes us more organized and productive.I love using sticky notes when I scrapbook. I might look at a few photos of a grandson playing soccer, and think that it might be great to get some soccer stickers the next time I'm out shopping. So I'll use two sticky notes. I put one on the photo, explaining why I didn't finish scrapbooking that photo - because I want to add soccer stickers - and then I write another sticky note to put in my purse, reminding me to buy soccer stickers.We use sticky notes to communicate with the grandkids' teachers. If I just write on a slip of paper, it's likely to get lost before the teacher can see it. But a sticky note in a bright color is sure to catch the teacher's attention.There is less adhesive on these sticky notes than there is on the name-brand product. If you mostly stick things to paper, that won't be a problem. If you stick them to a wall, they probably won't stay there.",

I find it hard to resist buying them, and I have a variety of sizes and colors, both plain and printed with cute sayings and graphics. This set of eight sticky pads was a terrific addition to my collection! At just under a dollar a pad, they're an excellent value, quite a bit less expensive than purchasing at an office supply store. Assuming, of course, you could find colorful ones like this at the office supply store. They are quite sticky, I find them comparable in stickiness to the popular name brand. You know which one I mean! I've had several of them stuck on the cork board next to my desk for days now, and they don't show any signs of going anywhere. They also don't leave any marks when removed from most surfaces I've tried them on. All these things combined result in an excellent quality product. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "They are really pretty colors. I found that the sticky area is just too light. I was using them for making notes and they didn't stay stuck to my table. The adhesive may be enough to stay stuck to paper but not other hard objects. They are adequate but i prefer name brand sticky notes.",

The sticky notes themselves seem to be comparable to name brand sticky notes that I have used in the past. They offer good adhesion and come in a pleasing array of different bright colors. I am sure that I will get a lot of use out of them in the future.",

The \"sticky\" is not too sticky or too little sticky, but just right. There are multiple colors, so if you need to color code your notes or items you have eight to choose from. At just under $1 per 80 sheet pad of sticky notes, these are a great value!",
