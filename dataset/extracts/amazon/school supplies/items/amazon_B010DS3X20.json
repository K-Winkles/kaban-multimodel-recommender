                "reviewText": "Some are no good right out of the box, with no tape threaded where it should be. Others will work for a while, before the tape gets off track and cannot be put right, or just breaks and cannot be retrieved. There is always tape left in the applicator when this happens. When they work, they are great, but the percentage of failure makes these a poor bet.I once tried utilize the BIC guarantee refund/replacement, but after lodging a complaint online they will want you to package up and mail back the bad ones, along with a receipt and original packaging (or some such--it's been a while since my last failed effort). Since I generally buy these when I think of it or run out, and they don't get used right away, these hurdles and the cost of postage effectively negate the guarantee.So, BIC is off my dance card and I'm looking for another, more reliable, brand.",
