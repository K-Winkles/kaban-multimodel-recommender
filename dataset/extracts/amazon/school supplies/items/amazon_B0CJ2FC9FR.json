These bags have a lot of my children to be able to clean up their own games without frustration. It has also allowed me to have less storage for the same amount of items as they are stackable and able to be placed side by side. The only downfall for these bags is they don\u2019t necessarily sit a game board. But they are perfect for games with multiple small pieces such as matching, cooties, cards. A little Lipo place in the front allows you to place a picture of the game or a label of the game. I also love that their color coordinated so I can put mine games in one color, multiple player games in another and my children know where to look for which games.",

                "reviewText": "These are great for a bunch of reasons, but this year I use it to store student headphones and password cards in their desks. Some students use the zipper loop to hang their bag on the desk hook. Others simple store it in their desk. Keeps cords from the headphone and mouse in a neat orderly place. Love!Only reason for 4 \u2b50\ufe0f is because the zipper loop sometimes comes undone over time AND zipper can bust if overfilled or pulled on harshly (only happened to 2).",

My husband has \u201cman eyes\u201d and this helped with being able to tell him where things are as well. So I can tell him the cough medicine is in the green mesh bag that is labeled Congestion/Cough/Allergy Medication. There\u2019s no longer any excuse not to find specific things.",
