This way I can make all the notes I want in my guides and if someone ever uses them after I do, I can easily remove my notes like they were never there.They are also great for notes on recipes, Bible studies, etc!!",

A book dart quickly gets me to the right page and can point to the line I was on.

This supply of transparent sticky notes will set me up for a long while! I love the idea of annotating my books with my thoughts + feelings, but I don't want to actually write on the books themselves (it feels like vandalism). This was the perfect solution!Works with graphite pencil, coloured pencil, ballpoint pen, gel pen, and marker! Also works with posca, but you have to let it dry a fair bit first. Remember with ballpoint, gel pen and marker to leave it alone a bit before touching it, otherwise it will smudge. But with ballpoint I guess you could deliberately do that to \"bold\" your words :DWill stick for a long time. I wrote on one and stuck it on the wall since the day it arrived and it hasn't fallen off even after 2/3 weeks. I didn't even have to clean the wall beforehand like they say you have to do to stick stuff to it. Booyah!",
