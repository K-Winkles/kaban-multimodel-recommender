                "reviewText": "These are so awesome! I\u2019ve been looking for a storage box that would fit all of my toddler\u2019s big, chunky crayons, as well as miscellaneous smaller toys. These are great because I can make them larger, or more compact. The \u201clock\u201d on the lid comes in handy, because he can still carry around his little box of art supplies, without the risk of the lid popping off and spilling everything.I love the bright colors! All of our chunky toddler crayons fit inside one (probably about 4 sets of 12), and toy pull-back cars and dinosaurs fit in another (2 advent calendars worth!). I\u2019m saving one box for me; it\u2019ll fit my gel nail polishes perfectly. These are easy to wipe clean, or can be thrown in the dishwasher.The only annoying thing is how easy it is to collapse it after you\u2019ve made it larger. My son tends to lean on them and put his weight on the box, causing it to collapse and break his crayons. \ud83e\udd74 Don\u2019t plan on putting anything fragile in these! It would be AWESOME if these had a little handle on top....I highly recommend this set for storing toys, art supplies, sidewalk chalk, makeup, tools..... ANYTHING!Hope this helps! \u263a\ufe0f",

They were extremely amused that they pop up and down and because kids are crazy over fidgets these days it gave them the fidget feel. The nice thing was that even thought their desk compartments were not big enough, they were able to remove a few unnecessary items and pop it down a notch to fit perfectly. The material is a durable material that I don't believe will rip from scissors or being poked by pencils through the school year. Very impressive item",
