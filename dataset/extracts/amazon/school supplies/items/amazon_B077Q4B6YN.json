They are amazing because the lead is thicker than normal, does not break, and makes handwriting easy to see and read. I also like the triangular body shape of the pencil, It fits nicely in my hand and is very comfortable. The erasers are big and do not break apart like other pencil erasers.

                "reviewText": "As an adult dealing with carpal tunnel, I stumbled upon PaperMate Handwriting Triangular Mechanical Pencils, and they've been nothing short of miraculous. Originally intended for kids learning to write, these pencils have become my everyday companions, transforming my writing experience completely.Ergonomic Bliss for Carpal Tunnel:The triangular shape of these pencils is a game-changer, especially for someone like me dealing with carpal tunnel. They are incredibly easy to hold and, when paired with a pencil gripper, provide unparalleled comfort. Writing for extended periods, whether in class or jotting down notes, is no longer a painful ordeal but a comfortable and enjoyable experience.Bold Lines, Bold Ideas:What truly sets these pencils apart for me is the 1mm lead, which creates thick, bold lines. As someone who loves writing with emphasis, these pencils allow me to express myself with confidence. The thickness of the lines adds a touch of boldness to my notes, making my handwriting not just legible but also visually striking.Durable and Long-Lasting:I've been using my most recent pack for a couple of months now, and I haven't needed to add more lead or change the eraser yet. Considering I use these pencils daily for college, their durability is impressive. The set even comes with extra erasers and lead, providing fantastic value for the price.Minor Eraser Quibble:While the eraser could be better, it's not a significant issue for me. I carry a separate eraser with me, so the minor flaw doesn't impact my experience much. Given the pencils' overall performance, this minor inconvenience is easy to overlook, especially considering the other fantastic features they offer.Conclusion:In conclusion, PaperMate Handwriting Triangular Mechanical Pencils have been a lifesaver for my hands and my handwriting. They offer unparalleled comfort, create bold and beautiful lines, and are incredibly long-lasting. As an adult navigating the challenges of carpal tunnel, I can't recommend these pencils enough. Whether you're a student, a professional, or anyone who enjoys writing with style and comfort, these pencils are a must-have. They've turned my daily writing tasks from a chore into a joy. Don't miss out on the ergonomic bliss and creative freedom these pencils offer. They are simply amazing!",

                "reviewText": "I'm a teacher and another teacher friend of mine had these. I borrowed one for 10 minutes and I was sold!!!!They write beautifully and feel like a real pencil. I love the erasers. They are super durable and I appreciate that they come with the refill as well. I dont find they are cheap/flimsy like other brand mechanical pencils. I frequently lose pencils but these have lasted 3 months in my classroom and I still have all of them!!!! I also like that these do not have an annoying clip on them (because they always break on me). I like that you just click the eraser for more of the graphite to come out.They are comfortable and write in a dark enough manner that it's easy to photocopy. 10/10 -- a must have. My only wish is that they make a pack that looks like a standard pencil instead of all the fun colors -- the fun colors are fun but I also like the classic pencil look too. I got these on sale and I hope they go on sale again so I can have some more!",

The eraser leaves a little to be desired but it's fine, just moves around while you use it a little more than is really helpful and it's not really a super clean erase, so you are gonna see a little something left over.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered these for my Young Children. I was annoyed at always having to sharpen pencils so the mechanical aspect is great. The thicker, chunky size of the pencil is also great for small hands and the lead is Much Thicker than a typical mechanical pencil allowing young writers to not break the pencil tip easily.I have ordered several packs of these over the last year or so. My kids love them and I actually really prefer using them over a regular pencil or other mechanical pencil too.Good quality & good price.",
