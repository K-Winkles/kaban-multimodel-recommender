                "reviewText": "These are 16 sticky note pads, two of each of eight colors. The colors are not super neon, but some are bright. There is a pale purple/lavender, a light blue, regular yellow and peach that are more pastel. Then there is an orange that is brighter, a darker pink, a lime green and a darker blue. I wouldn't call them neon, but bright. Either way, a pen would easily show up on any of the colors.I even used a blue ballpoint pen on the bright blue and it showed up fine. However, I will say that in my quest to find a blue pen, I went through a lot of dead pens in my house. When I scribbled on the blue pad to test out the pens, those marks went through onto the next sheet. So these notes are very thin.I continued my testing by using a Sharpie and writing on one of the pads. Without pressing very hard and just writing \"hello\" with Sharpie, it bled through onto the next sheet as well. So keep that in mind, depending on what you plan to use these for.The sticky factor was fine. They seem a little less sticky than other name brand sticky notes, but it stuck to the table and my shirt just fine. My daughter uses these to make notes on books that she is reading and they stick to book pages just fine without falling out even after turning the pages.Overall, they are great colors and fun, but the paper is a little thin.",

What stands out about this particular batch? I like the colors, they are slightly different shades than what I already have. Next, they separate easily. Some pads of sticky notes can have such strong adhesive that when they pull apart, they actually leave some sticky rescue on the next note, this set of sticky notes. Does not do that. It\u2019s possible that the sticky on these might be a little wimpy, but if I have to choose, I would prefer that to having the sticky so strong that it leaves residue on the next note or even breaks down the top note when you pull it off. Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with this set of sticky notes as well as the very, nice price",

                "reviewText": "This review is for the Sticky Notes 3x3 inches, 16 Pads Self-Stick Notes with 8 Bright Colors as I received this product free of charge through the Amazon Vine Program in exchange for my honest opinion review- positive or negative.The colors of these sticky notes are vibrant and bold. Some look neon colors to me while others look pastel colors. They each measure 3x3 inches, come in 8 different colors, and the quantity listed on the sellers Amazon page \u201c16 pack\u201d were all there in my package. Now to the sticky part- let\u2019s emphasize on the word S-T-I-C-K-Y- this is a feature that lacks on these self-stick notes because they don\u2019t hold up very well wherever you decide to stick them on. The name brand sticky notes offer a more stronger adhesive sticky glue that sticks well to any surface or material. These don\u2019t unfortunately and therefore is receiving a 3 star rating. These will work for me for the time being as I won\u2019t be buying sticky notes for a while, however, I wouldn\u2019t recommend getting these self-stick notes if the \u201csticky\u201d feature is not as good which is the main reason you would purchase this pack of 16 self-stick note pads.",
