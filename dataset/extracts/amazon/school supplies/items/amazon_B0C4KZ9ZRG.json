            "\u3010A Great Way to Build Number Sense\u3011Explore numbers in a variety of different ways using this flexible magnetic paper. Simply write a number at the top of the chart and invite students to write it in word form, mark it on a number line, color it as a series of base ten blocks, split it in number bonds, and separate out the hundreds, tens and ones digits. Then just wipe the chart clean to start again! Practicing so many math skills on one reusable paper.",
            "\u3010Giant Size for Homeschool & Classroom\u3011Aizweb dry erase magnetic paper measures 21.5\"x17\"(Consists of 2 pieces) and has huge spacing between the horizontal lines and offers plenty of space for handwriting or graphing to easily see at a distance. Great for teachers to interact in class, teach and visualize numbers, and practice math problems, which makes teaching easier and more efficient.",
            "\u3010Think About Numbers From Multiple Angles\u3011Number bond activities help children practice the connection between numbers and show how different numbers can be put together to arrive at the same answer. Base 10 blocks help kids understand that a symbol (such as \u201c124\u201d) represents a quantity and learn place value skills. Number lines let your students make comparisons between numbers, visualize numbers, and are more comfortable talking through math problems.",
            "\u3010Durable & Eco-Friendly & Waterproof\u3011Dry erase chart paper comes with a strong magnetic backing that securely adheres to any magnetic receptive surface, such as a refrigerator or magnetic white board. Smooth surface that is easy to write on and wipe clean without leaving stains. The dry-erase design and scratch-resistant laminated surface allow this product to last for years and help save time and sources.",
            "\u3010Perfect Gift for Teachers, Educators and Families\u3011It's a great educational gift for teachers and kids on birthdays, Christmas, Thanksgiving, back to school, Easter, New Year, and Halloween candy bags. We strive to provide you with the best quality products and service, If you have any problem with the magnetic lined paper for the whiteboard that you purchased from us, please feel free to contact us."
