Smooth Writing Experience:The pens provide a consistently smooth writing experience. Whether I\u2019m jotting down notes or working on intricate details, the ink flows effortlessly, resulting in neat and legible writing. 2. Comfortable Grip:The ergonomic design of these pens ensures a comfortable grip during extended writing sessions. This is a game-changer for me as it minimizes hand fatigue and enhances overall writing comfort. 3.

Additionally, I haven\u2019t encountered any issues with skipping, making these pens reliable for various writing tasks. 4. Variety of Colors:I love the assortment of colors in this pack! It adds a touch of creativity to my notes, and the vibrant hues make my writing more visually appealing. A great way to organize and highlight key points. 5. Durable and Long-Lasting:These pens have proven to be quite durable. The ink lasts a long time, and I appreciate not having to constantly replace them.

                "reviewText": "I work at an optical clinic, so I do a lot of exams and charting. I easily go through a few pens a month. While I feel that these pens are a little pricey to the average pen user, they are BY FAR one of the best writing pens I have used. I have bought 3 boxes at this point.I typically use Tul pens (even more expensive) and I have found that these surpass those pens in feel and writing. I know it sounds silly, but there really is a certain feel to how they write. The nub is super unique, too. The letters are VERY crisp + dark and I have encountered almost no smudging or bleeding while normally writing.The only problem I have encountered is in the morning when it is cold. The pens just don't work very well. Even so, that is pretty typical with pens like this and after putting it in my pocket for 20 minutes it is back to working perfectly.",

I like that their tails are the apparatus for attaching to my journal or a document (They look the cutest attached to the box they came in). They write smoothly, and the flow is great. Absolutely no leaking. It would be a neat idea to have each pen ink in a different color! However, I like the color of their ink just fine for writing in my daily journal. I am a lifetime artist and I store these pens along with my art supply pens so I can use them to record in my journal before I begin making/completing artwork. I love them!!!",

                "reviewText": "I have been looking for black pens for work as this is the only colour we are allowed to use. I work in health care and my previous pens I have bought have exploded in my pocket often. Was searching for a decent pen that can handle being in my pocket thought out my shift without ending up with ink on me.These pens write very well and the feel of them is so comfortable when writing. Ink doesn\u2019t smug. Love the colours of the pens. Will be buying more for sure.",
