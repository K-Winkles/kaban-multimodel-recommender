I found this brand and thought I'd try it out because the price was so good and some of the reviews answered my questions: do they erase easily, do they last.Having tried a couple of different brands in the past (including the name brand), I found some colors (even the name brand markers), and even some markers, just to be more challenging to erase. It didn't seem to matter about the brand. That was the same for longevity. So I tried these markers. I am 1/3 of the way through the first box and they are doing fine. Just like other brands some of the colors are harder to erase (red for example). However, in general I don't see any difference in performance (erasing and longevity) than other brands I've tried. I am satisfied with the purchase and have just made another purchase of them.",

Notice I keep my markers in a vertical position. Doesn't matter what brand I've used, if they are upside down or lay horizontally, the ink dries up or is lighter. So no matter what brand I buy/get (even the popular ones which are insanely overpriced) I keep them in an upright position. The orange was a little light when I opened the box upon arrival (the pen you see in the pic) but after being upright it is just fine and brightened up. Who knows how long they are upside down in shipping. So glad I purchased them. I love all the different colors and you get so many. What a plus. Don't think I'll use the popular brand again.

Dentro, los 60 ROTULADORES (5 por cada uno de los 12 colores incluidos) nos llegan \"de pie\" en un par de bandejas.LA VARIEDAD DE COLORES es estupenda, incluyendo los habituales negro, azul y rojo, junto con un verde oscuro y marr\u00f3n menos comunes, a los que se suman unos coloridos rosa, naranja, amarillo, verde claro y cian (azul claro) que son de lo m\u00e1s resultones.Cabe destacar que los CAPUCHONES, no s\u00f3lo tienen agujeros anti-asfixia, sino que adem\u00e1s cuentan con una forma que evita que salgan rodando cuando los dejamos apoyados sobre una superficie plana.Un punto MUY POSITIVO es que son INODOROS, pues la verdad es que no se aprecia ning\u00fan olor, al contrario que en otros rotuladores similares que he utilizado que, normalmente, tienen un olor como raro que a m\u00ed me suele resultar muy poco agradable.En cuanto a SU TINTA, cubre bien la superficie, y realiza trazos muy n\u00edtidos. Tambi\u00e9n me ha parecido que resultan f\u00e1ciles de borrar, si bien es cierto que no suelo dejar secar mucho tiempo los trazos que realizo.En relaci\u00f3n con SU PRECIO DE 33'95\u20ac (0'57\u20ac/rotulador) cuando lo adquir\u00ed, pues veo que actualmente no se encuentra disponible, resulta m\u00e1s econ\u00f3mico que otras opciones similares vendidas en Amazon, si bien casi ninguna incluye tantos rotuladores en un \u00fanico pack.\u00bfTienes alguna duda sobre este producto? Escribe tu consulta en el apartado de preguntas e intentar\u00e9 responderte.Y si te ha resultado \u00fatil mi valoraci\u00f3n o fotos, agradecer\u00e9 mucho si pinchas el bot\u00f3n \ud83c\udd84\ud83c\udd83\ud83c\udd78\ud83c\udd7b \u2935\ufe0f\ufe0f",
