Also these are harmless to books which is wonderful!",

These are literally perfect. They are a thin plastic, not paper (which is exactly what I was looking for, I didn't want them to tear), transparent so they don't cover/block text (you can place them anywhere on the page) and honestly pull off easily enough and cleanly so you can replace them if you suck at placement like I do. A while you can lift them easily enough, they do stick very well and don't come off unless you want them to.I have zero complaints, they were a great buy. :)",

Of course you don\u2019t want to tear the flags off but they stick well and are removed effortlessly.I use them whenever I read a new book and want to get as much out of it as possible.Highly recommend to any book lover, student, author, etc\u2026",
