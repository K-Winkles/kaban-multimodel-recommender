But liquid white out was annoying to use. Took too long to dry, rarely went on smoothly, too messy if you didn\u2019t let it dry enough, and became thick and lumpy after a while. I don\u2019t know what took me so long to search on Amazon for a different kind of white out, but I finally did. And wow, what a difference! I feel like I\u2019ve been living in the Dark Ages, using something that was popular when typewriters were still being used!!I love this product.
