This little printer is so neat \u2013 it's tiny enough to fit in a backpack, but still does an awesome job printing labels for all sorts of stuff. My kid has been having a blast labeling school supplies, books, and even made labels for a DIY project. It's super easy to use; it connects right to a phone or tablet with Bluetooth, and no mess with ink because it's thermal. The print quality is really good for its size. It was so easy to set up, even my 12-year-old had it figured out in no time. Definitely a cool gift if you're looking for something unique and practical for a tech-savvy kid!",

The kids just take a picture of the information and then they print it out and we glue or tape into their notebook. I love that there is no ink to replace. One less thing to have to remember to buy. The kids actually LOOK FORWARD to adding something neat to their notes now so they can use the TINY PRINT. :)",

                "reviewText": "I was all prepared to leave a one star review. The product states that it is a sticker paper mini photo printer. However it is loaded with \"receipt\" paper, it comes with 5 rolls, 4 of them receipt paper, one of them actual sticker paper. It took several trys to get it connected but it finally connected. Once I realized it actually had sticker paper I was a lot more please but I am still frustrated that I needed to order more sticker paper upon arrival. The photo printer and app is really cool for what it is. I like that it is pre loaded with imagines and clip art that is useful like, to do list, post it notes, picture icons, etc. What I would like to see uploaded are numbers in perhaps a fancy font or a way to change the font for words. What I don't like is the inconsistency of print intervals, waisted room and the paper is used up pretty quickly. I thought the thermal images, what prints, were fine.",
