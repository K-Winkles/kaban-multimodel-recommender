                "reviewText": "This sharpener has been a complete game-changer. My son regularly uses colored pencils. I've always struggled to find a sharpener that can handle the softer leads without breaking them that a child can also use. This sharpener, however, has exceeded my expectations.Firstly, the auto-stop feature is a standout. It ensures that pencils are sharpened to a perfect point without over-sharpening or causing any breakage. This is particularly crucial for colored pencils, which tend to have softer leads. It even has a sharpness level selector allowing me to choose just how sharp the pencil will be when the auto-stop turns on.The speed of this sharpener is another aspect worth mentioning. It sharpens pencils incredibly fast, keeping my son happy as he completes his projects. What a time suck to manually sharpen pencils, or give up when you found 2 red pencils without a point and use orange instead.Additionally, the ease of use and cleaning is commendable. It\u2019s very straightforward to operate, making it suitable for both adults and children (under supervision). The shavings reservoir is also a decent size, meaning I don't have to empty it constantly, and when I do, it's a quick and clean process.The build quality of the sharpener is robust, and it has a stable base, ensuring it doesn\u2019t move around while in use. Its compact size means it doesn\u2019t take up much space on my desk, which is always a bonus in a busy workspace.My only wish was that it worked with batteries instead of plugged into a wall, but I'm ok with this since it works so well. I've gone through so many of those cheap crap sharpeners, this one finally works!",

                "reviewText": "As a kindergarten Teaching Assistant, I sharpen LOTS of pencils: #2 pencils, colored pencils, you name it. I used to wrestle with the standard school-provided sharpener, but it tended to break the pencil points as it sharpened them and leave the points uneven, with wood on one side. This sharpener never breaks points, sharpens evenly all around, stops automatically when the pencil reaches the ideal sharpness, and operates quickly and relatively quietly. The clear casing means I can see when the shavings need to be emptied. This sharpener makes my job easier, and the kids literally ask to watch it work. One of the best tools I've ever bought for my job!",

She was making a mess with the manual and battery pencil sharpeners. When she started using this new sharpener, she sharpens dozens of colors at a time and get a nice sharp pencil tip to work on the fine details in some of her pictures.",

I have been using a manual pencil sharpener- KUM brand and a Faber Castell and while those are fantastic to have- this electric one makes easy work of alllll my pencils. Wow! I tried another one called Zmol and while it was fine it didn't do the larger pencils like this one.This Afmat sharpener also doesn't eat your pencils. If it's eating your pencils you're doing something wrong. It actually has two settings- slightly blunted point and pointy point. It also has an auto stop feature. I found it's not difficult to engage this, but if I'm on the couch enjoying my evening and using my pencils- I turn this puppy slightly on it's side, tucked in between me and the couch and it absolutely does engage. It's fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. I'm glad the price finally dropped. It's worth the $22 bucks and change. It would have been harder to justify the expense at $40. I know the prices are manipulated. That's Amazon.BUY THIS SHARPENER!!!Yes- for all you coloring cultists- it DOES sharpen your crappy precious Square Brut Funers. I enjoyed testing out the sharpener on those horrible pencils.",
