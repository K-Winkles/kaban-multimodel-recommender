                "reviewText": "It's tough to get excited about a really cheap pen, and it's no secret that the pen enthusiasts out there turn up their noses at the Bic Round Stic. After all, this pen does not write like a more expensive pen; the ink isn't as smooth or as dark, and there's no grip or ergonomic design treatments. But at $6 for a box of 60, there's nothing to complain about. In fact, I believe that Bic gives you an excellent pen for such a small price. That's why you see Bic Round Stics everywhere. It's a little workhorse that provides smooth, reliable writing for really cheap, and while skinny, it's still fairly comfortable to hold and slides easily into all pen cups. And of course, you don't care if they get lost, stolen, or get an occasional dud in the box...there are many more at your disposal! The Round Stic is actually one of my most favorite pens, mainly because I appreciate what a great value for the money it is and it really does work well overall.",
