Easy to organize each folder for every class. But if you have a kid that no matter what, will stuff a paper in any folder this works great because it all goes together.No concern that they left that science work sheet in the social studies folder or that they grabbed the wrong folder because they are together.The entire thing is spiral so it\u2019s easy for a child or an adult to open to the folder they need and not take up an entire desk of space.It\u2019s light weight and as thin as it can be. It\u2019s like switching your closet hangers from thick plastic to thin flocked ones. We first ordered a trapper keeper style folder but it was over sized and heavy without anything in it and those were too big to fit in their backpack.The clipboard and paper is great for quick notes and/or forgotten assignments.",

So we bought him a new one for this school year and it arrived with one of the tabs broken off. I'm so disappointed.It was in plastic wrap and had bubble wrap in the box, so I don't think the damage happened in transit. Plus, we couldn't find the broken tab piece, so I assume it was gone before being wrapped in plastic. Not going to waste my time to return it.",

Good colors, pockets are easy to use, and the folder swings open easily. The paper pad in the back is study and replaceable. They haven\u2019t tried the erasable tabs yet but I think that is an attractive feature.One caveat is the front clip. This isn\u2019t designed to replaced a heavily used clipboard. It\u2019s study enough for securing papers you don\u2019t replace often, and I don\u2019t worry about it breaking on the teen. However, if you are a power-clipboard person and change papers often, be aware that the front cover flexes. For securing papers such as schedules, it\u2019s great and papers don\u2019t slip.",
