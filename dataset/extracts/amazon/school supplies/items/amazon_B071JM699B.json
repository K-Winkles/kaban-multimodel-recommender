                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great price for a quality, basic pencil",
                "reviewText": "At the end of the school year, I always buy a pack of pencils to replenish my depleted stock. (I teach 7th and 8th grade English). Last year, I bought 144 golf pencils for about $8. It was a great investment, because a lot of times, I have kids who ALWAYS forget a pencil. They aren\u2019t the ones who necessarily need a pencil, because more often than not, they would lose the pencil again before they made a mistake. However, despite having 144 of them, I ran out in late April, with about two months still left in the school year. I will buy another pack of those golf pencils for the students who perpetually borrow a pencil, but I quickly learned that every so often, I had a student who really needed a pencil, but wasn\u2019t someone who made a habit of bringing nothing to class. Likewise, these were students were the ones who didn\u2019t need it for a few periods, but truly needed a new pencil for them to keep for weeks. Unfortunately, I didn't have any \u201creal\u201d pencils, and when I saw these AmazonBasic pencils on sale (96 for about $6 \u2013 regularly they\u2019re less than $8), I knew I needed these as well.I\u2019m actually really picky about my own personal pencils. I have a favorite brand, and I have a favorite brand of erasers to put on them. Nevertheless, I was really excited to try out these pencils because although they didn't have the price tag of a Dixon-Ticonderoga, they still worked really well.QUALITY:These are just your every day, basic pencils, but that\u2019s how I like mine. I hate pencils with that plastic film with a design printed on them. With \u201ccute\u201d pencils, you aren\u2019t paying for the pencil, you\u2019re paying for whatever logo is on it (like Frozen or Star Wars). When you sharpen those ones for the first time, the film splits and then the cute design ends up peeling off. However, these AmazonBasics pencils were easy to sharpen, and they were nice to write with. Sometimes, pencils are prone to have the graphite split so there is a strange press on the paper, resulting in \u201cdouble\u201d writing. I wrote for a bit with the pencil and even as it dulled, it still wrote nicely. You can note a small letter I wrote to test it; it is the third image.ERASER:Another thing I hate about cheap pencils is the garbage erasers. As a teacher, I write most things in pen, but I always do my grade book in pencil. If a student turns in something late, I need to erase the previous grade to change it, and I can\u2019t stand having left over marks from a bad eraser. Now, as I mentioned, I have one specific brand of erasers which are honestly God\u2019s gift to humanity, and I always slap one of those bad boys on my pencils, but this really wasn\u2019t bad as far as erasers go. I mean, it was still obvious that I made a mistake, but I also press into the paper like I\u2019m trying to cut a hole into the table underneath. I write DARK. I have many students who press lightly. As well, if I were drawing, I would draw lighter. In the third picture attached to this review, there are two instances of erasing. The first is over \u201cfilm\u201d in fourth line in the first paragraph. The other is the second paragraph, titled \u201cEraser test.\u201d As I mentioned, I write so dark that it\u2019s difficult to erase to the point where it doesn\u2019t appear that there was a mistake at all, but I also think your average person wouldn\u2019t mind. I can clearly make out what is written over the erased bits, and no annoying parts of the eraser were left behind (like a giant pink smudge\u2026 Ugh, I hate that the most).SMUDGE TEST:Speaking of smudges, I don\u2019t frequently smudge my pencil work because I\u2019m right handed. However, I have left handed students who turn in work that is barely legible because they drag their hand throughout their writing constantly. Thinking of them, I wanted to test out how badly the graphite smudged on a hand. The results are the fourth picture. Now, this wasn\u2019t just me carefully dragging my hand over the paper; I really pressed, TRYING to smudge the words. And yeah, I did smudge it a bit, and yeah, I did get some graphite on my hand. However, this is NOTHING compared to some of the other pencils I\u2019ve seen. As you can see from my hand, it was minor, considering I was literally pressing hard on the paper, trying to get the graphite on my hand.OVERALL:The bottom line is that a 12 pack of any type of pencils can go for over $2. In fact, a lot of times the \u201ccute\u201d pencils are the most expensive, but they\u2019re the worst as far as quality. If looks aren\u2019t a thing you care about, but do care about quality, these are the best deal. A 96 pack of Ticonderoga pencils can range from $14-$20 (depending on packaging and color and where you\u2019re buying them). I always use Ticonderogas as the standard for the perfect pencil because I used them throughout my childhood; my mother was literally born in Ticonderoga, NY. However, the AmazonBasics are the best bang for your buck. Are they cute? Is your kid going to be inspired by the cool Frozen or Star Wars logo? No. Because this is a standard, BASIC pencil. They\u2019re just yellow. But to be honest, those \u201ccool looking\u201d pencils always lack quality compared to something like this. The simplicity is what makes these pencils so great; they\u2019re just pencils. They know their function, and they get the job done. These are definitely going to be my \u201cgood\u201d pencils from now on, especially to give out to kids who really are responsible with their supplies.",

The quantity should last a while.Cons:None at this timeIf you are in need of a good quality pencil for your kids\u2019 school supplies, office, or just to have at home, these are ones you should buy.

                "reviewText": "I just received these pencils with UPS today 5/8/18. As a mother, I have bought many pencils for my kids and myself over the years. I always tried to keep the budget down on buying school supplies to leave wiggle room for other school necessities i.e. clothes and shoes. I would buy the cheap boxes of pencils they had on sale in the special department they put out every year that had all the school supplies. I would notice my kids always went through pencils like crazy. Every time we sharpened them, they would chip, appear rough or jagged or splinter. The pencil would have to be sharpened over and over because the lead kept breaking off into the sharpeners. The lead also would be loose inside the pencil shaft and just fall out. I bought all different kinds of sharpeners thinking maybe it was the sharpening blade that caused all this damage and wastefulness. Anyway, on to the review of this particular brand. Upon sharpening it the first time, the pencil is smooth and clean, free of any splintering. The pencil took a little bit longer to sharpen then other pencils in an electric pencil sharpener, which to me appears the wood is strong and good quality. I am no expert on the matter, just my personal opinion. The lead did not break at all, did not fall out of the pencil shaft. It is in there nice and sturdy no gaps at all. I tested the writing part of it. It seems to write smoothly, not overly dark or needing to press too hard to get it to show up. It provides smooth consistent strokes across the page with the lead, unlike other pencils that I have used where the lead seems to feel grainy like there was little sand mixed in with the lead. The eraser appears to be good quality as well. Applying normal pressure erasing something, cleaned up my drawing the first time going over it without the need to keep erasing over and over. There was no pink residue left behind after erasing. The eraser is firm, but not dry or brittle. It has not crumbled, or loosened from the top of the pencil as with some cheap ones. I am not a professional artist, but it seems to sketch well, and smoothly without the need to keep repeating the strokes, unless of course you intend to do that on purpose. There is some dust left after shading, which dust get on your skin or smudge. But not with general writing. I have run my finger over it a few times and it is not smudging for me. This is was tested on a basic lined paper from a 5 subject notebook. Unfortunately the pictures I took are very grainy. As soon as I can find a good camera, I will take a pic and upload. As for now, I am impressed with the pencils I bought. I would definitely buy them again. The price is very well worth it. I got 144 pencils for $9.99. Just to give you an idea: 18 ct for Dixon Ticonderoga #2 HB pencils at Walmart costs $3.26. As far as I am concerned, these pencils were better than those not only in price but quality as well. The Dixon broke quite often in the sharpener when my kids were sharpening. This will be my new go to pencil for my family! <3",
