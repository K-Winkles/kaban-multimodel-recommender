The colors that I was worried would be too dark (purple and blue) were the perfect amount of sheer and light so that they would not cover words. The highlighters themselves are also so very cute. The only issue I have with them is that they don\u2019t flow very lightly and smoothly and it isn\u2019t that satisfying to highlight using them, but the colors and packaging make up for it. Very good for the price!",

It would add some cuteness it leaked through the paper but not too much if you are looking for a highlighter for the aesthetic this is for you but if your looking for a dependable work highlighter maybe another option it\u2019s honestly your choice but I would rate this a 8/10",

A warning- be careful when taking off the cap of the highlighter and putting it on the back. There is this little white part that comes off and can get stuck and you can't get out so you lose the cap to one end and it drys out. Lightly put the cap on the back or dont put it on. *see the pic's above*",

The caps are also perfect, they come off easily without you having to struggle to open them (unlike the thick Sharpie highlighters)10/10 Would buy again",
