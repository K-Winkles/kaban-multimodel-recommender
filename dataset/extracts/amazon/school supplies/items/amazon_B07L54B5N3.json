I never know when I may need blue ink for signatures/important documents or red ink for annotating things. I love that Bic offers pens with three different ink colors in one box because that definitely ups the convenience factor. Also, each ink color writes equally well and reliably, unlike competing pens from the brand with the two hearts logo. At only $6.39 for a box of 60, you can't go wrong here, considering the quality, convenience, and usefulness of these pens.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this at a pretty reasonable price. I'm a student so I go through pens alot and this has good quality. That being said, it's a variety pack that has 60 pens total and although I mostly use black pens I wish this was more balanced. They could of given us 20 of each (since 20\u00d73=60). I believe the 10 red pens I received are going to run out quickly because I use those to make corrections and to make my text stand out. I mainly use the black pen, add things with the blue pen and make corrections with the red. It feels like I will never run out of black but will run out of blue and red which means I will have to purchase them separately (which is costly) or continue to buy the variety pack only to receive an endless supply of black pens. I don't think anyone would be upset if the pens were evenly distributed. This is a convenient purchase but I'm also a bit annoyed that I will have to be on the hunt for blue and red pens (since I bought a variety pack that should last for a long time).",
