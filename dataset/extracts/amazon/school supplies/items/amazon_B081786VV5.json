                "reviewText": "My daughter will be entering 4th grade in September and I was thrilled to see the entire supply list all in one box without running to the stores! You get a lot in the box including a binder, a paper pack, a red pen, dividers, a spiral notebook, pencil case, pencils, markers, Crayola crayons, dry erase markers, a folder, index cards, a highlighter, composition books, erasers, colored pencils, etc. Wonderful value and no scouting for the items in stores.Even though most of it is a no name brand, the quality is excellent. The colored pencils were about as good as Crayola. The scissors felt a bit cheap, but cut good. The dry erase markers are terrible - They write fine, but you will have a hard time erasing them without the \"ghost\" effect of them smudging and staining. The earbuds were junk - they are equivalent to putting rocks in your ears. They came with very thin pads that ripped when we tried to install the pads onto the earbuds. The eraser actually did a good job as did the pre-sharpened pencils. The index cards felt kind of thin, but even a sharpie didn't bleed through, so they're good. We are very pleased with the whole set!",

                "reviewText": "This school supply box is perfect for the busy parent who doesn't have the time to fight the crowds at the store just to find out the store sold out of that one thing you need on the list. With this kit, most of your son or daughter's first day of school necessities are already taken care of for an incredibly reasonable price. Ordering this school supply box saved me a ton of time and peace of mind. Plus, even if you don't have little ones, the supplies in this box are a perfect way to donate to your local organizations that might need help giving supplies to needy kids. All in all, a fantastic product I will be telling my friends and relatives with school aged kids to order from. Incredibly satisfied customer!",
