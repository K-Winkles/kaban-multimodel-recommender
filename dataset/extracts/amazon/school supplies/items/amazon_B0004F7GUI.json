The variety of vivid colors in this pack is excellent. They truly stand out. I\u2019ve tried other brands of dry erase markers but this one last so much longer. They erase cleanly and easily too.On a side note, I have a toddler in the house who loves this markers but always forget to but the cap one and they don\u2019t dry out. Big plus if you have kids in the house.",
