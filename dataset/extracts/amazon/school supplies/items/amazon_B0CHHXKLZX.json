I can pick it up with one of my Hobbit-hands, but if I stuffed it totally full and rounded it out, I probably would need to pick it up by the strap.Three compartments. The middle one is the largest. It's gusseted at the base, where the zipper must wrap past the gusseting. It is large enough to handle a regular office stapler. Actually, you could probably put two in there if you stacked them appropriately to maximize the space. And maybe some staplers. It's big, y'all.The two compartments on the outside (Or compartments 1 and 3 if you want to number them) have many pockets. One side has elastic pen loops stitched on a flap, the other one has a single elastic strap across the inside so you can fit wider things, like rulers. It easily accomodates a full, adult-sized pair of scissors. There's also a zippered mesh pocket for all the bits and bobs required to be a fully stocked stationery superhero.It's also very well put together. There are actually two straps, one that runs the length of the bottom so you could carry it like a lunchbox? And one on a short end that's just a loop, which could be caribinered to your backpack.Love it.",

                "reviewText": "The pencil case is bigger than I thought. Lots of compartments to store all the stationaries. If you need to carry all the stationaries it will be useful. Material quality is durable. The double zipper on the center compartment is very convenient. If you just need to store pens or pencils only it is a little bulky.",

                "reviewText": "This cushioned case has three separate compartments. The middle compartment is the largest and plainest. It can hold a lot of pens, or a stapler, or whatever bulky small items you want to transport. One of the side compartments has a divided elastic band (and bottom pocket) to hold larger pens or tools. I use that side to hold my cardmaking tools, like a pick, bone folder, and craft knife. It also has two pockets for thin items like sticky notes or business cards. The last side compartment has one large elastic band (and bottom pocket). I use that to hold scissors, a short T-ruler, and other wide tools. It also has a zippered mesh pocket that can hold erasers other items you want to keep secure. I really like the design of this pen case: it is very functional, and still very cute. I got the light blue case. I plan to decorate it with permanent vinyl. I highly recommend this case for any crafter on the go.",

                "reviewText": "This is a lightweight, aesthetically pleasing and yet quite spacious pen/pencil case! There are three main compartments, the middle acting as more of a traditional pencil case style large pocket while the opposing side compartments housing various pens and stationery supplies. I decided to put as many sticky note pads in this as I could, alongside both my regular black and colored gel pens, plus a few other things like small sticker labels. I could easily fit much more in at least two of the three compartments, especially if I took out a sticky note pad or two.The zippers don't snag and feel smooth to open and close with. The outer texture is, to me at least, similar to that of a raincoat, which to me also implies it will indeed stand up to a little rain if necessary. It's small enough to fit in most desk drawers or rest atop a desk without taking up excess space, but obviously big enough for whatever storage needs you might have for a workspace of any kind. I'm very happy with this pouch and, thanks to it, have much less clutter on my desk already, plus an easy way to find exactly what I'm looking for at any given moment! Definitely recommend.",

She would take a couple of pencil bags to school with her every day so she could draw at lunch and breaks. We got this pencil bag for her and now she only has to take one.This is an impressive bag, to say the least. I am amazed at just how much it can hold. It is well made and should last her for some time.Highly Recommended.",

The outer fabric is waterproof.I'm not a fan of the polyester inner fabric so I took a star off for the material type (I'm just picky in general haha).",
