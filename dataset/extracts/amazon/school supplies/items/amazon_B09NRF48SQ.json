                "reviewText": "I bought this large pack of scissors because for some reason scissors seem to walk away and disappear in my house. I think these are ok for accomplishing basic paper cutting, slicing open chip bags and poly mail bags. They are extremely lightweight compared to my other scissors purchased from Walmart, dollar store, etc. I think the handle holes could be a little larger as my fingers felt slightly cramped while cutting items. Due to these two characteristics, they don\u2019t feel sturdy in hand while cutting. A couple times during use, the top blade closed down too far, surpassing the bottom blade a little. I tightened the screw and it seems to have fixed the issue. The blades are sharp and slice, easily. These will not work on heavier items such as cardboard. I go to my KitchenAid scissors for that. Overall, these will do, but my true opinion is the ones from the dollar tree are more comfortable and sturdy. If I wasn\u2019t feeling so lazy, I would\u2019ve made the trip to buy those instead. They\u2019re cheaper and better.",
