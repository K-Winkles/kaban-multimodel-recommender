I\u2019ve never had an issue with it leaking, my son will sometimes put the lid on backwards so the seal isn\u2019t lined up but nothing has ever leaked out of it. I use a bottle brush to clean it with so it super easy to get clean. It\u2019s a great size, probably could use a smaller one for my son but next year it\u2019ll be perfect size for him.",

                "reviewText": "*Updated review: seller contacted me after seeing my review and asked how they could make it right. I replied I wouldn\u2019t be happy unless I had a replacement or a refund. I sent a picture of the cracked inner compartment and two days later, I had a complete replacement in the mail.5 stars for customer service. The product itself has pros and cons.Pros: way cheaper than the pricier B****o boxes.The built in silverware compartment is very handy as well. My girl loved that I was able to slip little notes in the silverware section for her to find with her lunch.Also, it is lightweight compared to the name brand competitor, and the outer section seems very sturdy. Customer service is excellent.Cons: My first one cracked (interior compartment) at first use we\u2019ll see how long this replacement lasts?*Original review:My daughter used this for the first time today for the first day of school. Tonight, when I went to wash it, there is a big crack in the bottom portion leaving it unusable. I am past the 30 days of purchase so I cannot return it even though we just used it for the first time. Bummer!",
