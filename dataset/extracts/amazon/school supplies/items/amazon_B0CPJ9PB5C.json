The TKJovile 1000 PCS Punny Reward Stickers have been a delightful addition to our toolkit. These 'YAY!' stickers are the icing on the cake for both my kiddies and myself. Fun, cute, and engaging, they come with delightful sayings that add to the overall charm of the set. Initially, I was disappointed that it only had four sheets of designs, but the multitude of stickers proved to be a cool feature. With so many repeats, my kiddies still have a chance to win the one they really want.The stickers are of excellent quality and versatile. They can be used on water bottles, tablet cases, paper, and books without leaving a sticky residue when removed. The fact that they restick and can even be washed if applied to the outside of a water bottle makes them even more practical for various uses in our homeschooling adventuresThe stickers are of excellent quality and versatile.

The puns alone have the potential to encourage language learning, critical thinking and to boost vocabulary. At the same time, the stickers are prized by students. While very young children might struggle to grasp some of the puns, most are appropriate for various ages. My nine year old grandson read through every one of the 100 different ones! He had only one criticism, stating that the pun \u201cyou\u2019re doing just fine-apple\u201d should have a picture of a pineapple instead of a green apple.The stickers have a glossy vinyl look. Some can be slightly challenging to peel off the backing, but they all adhere securely. When placed on items other than paper or clothing, they can be removed and will still stick again without leaving any residue. The 40 sheets of stickers come in a vinyl pouch making them easy to keep organized. There were also ten larger buns stickers included. This is a quality product at a very reasonable price.",

                "reviewText": "\"Quantity has a quality all its own\" and getting 1000 of these pun stickers for $10 is a great deal. My elementary aged kid and her classmates love the pun stickers (in general) so we'll passing these ones out for Valentine's Day this year.My kid also loves earning sheets of these by doing a good job at things -- so it's a great motivational tool. And there are so many you don't have to say \"you just get 1 sticker\" but instead you get to say \"you get 1 sticker sheet!\" :)A few of the puns are a bit of a stretch -- buuuut on the whole I can't complain because you get so many for the price. (Like \"Goodse point\" with 2 geese)I was close to docking this product one star because off the few odd issues (Like \"Crabul ous effort!\" having a misplaced space) -- but it's a 5 if you don't mind a few things here and there. Because again 1000 stickers for $10 means you pay just 1 penny per sticker! Plus on the whole so many are adorable - they make me smile just looking at them.",

I love the puns on them, they\u2019re entertaining for adults and students alike. These stickers are durable and waterproof, I tested one out on my phone and it\u2019s still holding on strong without it getting rubbed out or wearing away. I peeled off a cover to test if it would leave a residue or not stick anymore and start curling up, but so far so good. Overall, these are really nice and everyone loves them.",

Some of the cuts were not 100% all the way through while some were too deep. This is really not a big issue and should not deter you in any way. You may just have to be more forceful or careful when you pull a few of them off the sheets.",
