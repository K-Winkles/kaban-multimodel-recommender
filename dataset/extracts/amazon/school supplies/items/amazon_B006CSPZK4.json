First of all, the delivery was incredibly fast, arriving at my doorstep in just a matter of days. This quick delivery allowed me to put these pencils to use right away.The price point for this pack of pencils is truly a steal. Not only do you get a generous count of 30 pencils, but they also come pre-sharpened, which is a huge time-saver. The 2 HB soft lead provides a smooth writing experience, whether I\u2019m jotting down notes or sketching. The classic yellow color and the iconic Ticonderoga branding make these pencils easily recognizable and a staple for any stationery collection.I\u2019m pleased to say that these pencils are exactly as advertised. The quality and performance live up to the Ticonderoga reputation. They sharpen nicely, write smoothly, and the lead doesn\u2019t smudge easily. Whether you\u2019re a student, professional, or artist, these pencils are versatile and reliable.",
