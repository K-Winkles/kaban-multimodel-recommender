                "reviewText": "The cards are of good quality and uniform in size. Love the fact that they are made in the USA. The only shortcoming of the cards is the thickness. When using a marker to make notes on the cards, the markers bleeds through the card and can be seen on the opposite side. This makes the cards less usable as I wanted to use the marker to make bold and easy to read flash cards. I ended up using a ballpoint pen which could also be seen through the card (but usable)",
