I wasn\u2019t sure if this would work well or not, but I cannot stress how easy and great this stamp kit is. I labeled all of my younger kid\u2019s stuff the night before he went to his first sleepaway camp, and it could not have be easier. Bonus is you have plenty of letters and can swap out for a different kid\u2019s name. The icons are nice to make embarrassing labels on everything a bit more tolerable haha.I found there to be a bit of a learning curve to get the stamp to align properly on the thinner sized stickers included, but once I lined the stamp frame up with the perforated sticker sheet lines, it was fine. Now to see if kiddo keeps his stuff together at camp or throws laundry all over the floor like at home \u2026 tbd!",

But by far, the best part about this bundle is the stampable stickers. The stamp goes on clear, dries quickly, and the stickers stick to everything! They even stay on clothing through the wash and stay on his water bottle through the dish washer. I wish I could buy more stickers separately.",
