There is NO WAY these notes are going to fall out of this book. The adhesive is STRONG!!! I was able to pick up each side of the book with the smallest section of notes. The adhesive is so good, in fact, 2 of the tab sections (the top two)\u2014the last group of colors on each were glued to the book. I was able to peel them away carefully, though I did damage 2 or 3 of the bigger lined ones (one completely stuck still), The other one I did not damage. I don't mind much, but I did want to warn others. As for them sticking to other surfaces, I will hardly need to use them for anything other than a book, but they have supplied little individual double-sided tape stickies that I believe will definitely solve the issue of stickiness others were mentioning. I'm not sure why some rated so low! They even sent a note with an email address asking for feedback and to offer exchanges and refunds. I think this is a great product. The quality is awesome, and it does seem like the company really listens to feedback and fixes issues. Hope this helps someone else because I'm so happy I purchased this!! P.S. I'm a sucker for stickers and the mustache one sent with my order is so stinking cute!!!",

I do agree with other reviews that the adhesion is not that great, but overall I would purchase again since I am only using this to keep notes in books I'm reading so the adhesion holds on thin pages and as long as the book is closed it stays flat and sticks. I am planning to purchase again for my daughter for back to school. I would recommend trying them out and for the price it's actually pretty good.",
