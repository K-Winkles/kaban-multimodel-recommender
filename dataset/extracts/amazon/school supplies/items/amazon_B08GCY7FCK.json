                "reviewText": "These crayons were not for me but for my Niece who started teaching first grade this school year. I knew that there might be a need for these even though she and/or the students would likely have all that they would need but I like to always be prepared and thought that these would come in handy. She certainly appreciated them and has been able to keep everyone well supplied with plenty to spare! I sent a few other items as well just your basic classroom necessities. I feel that that as much as the school and/or parents should provide for their kids - I know that there will always be those who cannot afford or provide and hope that these items help to fill those gaps. Anyhow, congratulations to my Niece for having the guts to become a teacher - and a first grade teacher at that!",
