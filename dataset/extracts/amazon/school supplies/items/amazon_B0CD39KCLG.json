                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Mcsalay Cute School Supplies for Kids and I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase. This pink stationary set is perfect for girls in grades K-5 and makes for a great Christmas or birthday gift.First of all, the design of the stationary set is adorable. The pink color and kawaii theme make it fun and appealing for young girls. The set includes an electric pencil sharpener, vacuum cleaner, eraser, and more. These items are all essential for school and having them in such a cute design makes studying more enjoyable.The electric pencil sharpener works like a charm. It sharpens pencils quickly and efficiently, saving time and effort. The vacuum cleaner is a unique addition to the set and is perfect for cleaning up eraser shavings or pencil dust. It's a small but powerful tool that adds convenience to the study area.The eraser included in the set is of high quality and erases cleanly without leaving any smudges. It's always frustrating when erasers leave marks on the paper, but this one does the job perfectly. The other items in the set, such as the ruler and scissors, are also of great quality and are durable enough to withstand daily use.Overall, I highly recommend the Mcsalay Cute School Supplies for Kids. It's a fantastic gift option for young girls and the quality of the items is excellent. The cute design adds a touch of fun to studying and makes it more enjoyable. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and will definitely be buying more products from Mcsalay in the future.",

                "reviewText": "This set has so many cute stuff in it. From electric pencil sharpener,electric vacuum cleaner,electric eraser,pencils,sticky index tabs,origami paper and so on. Great for back to school and as a gift.LOVE this supply or accessory set! So I had to order this pink set as soon as I saw it! Mainly for my daughter (maybe also a bit for ME) and it is totally worth the price! First off, this is a great set! Just in terms of quantity of the items included and also the quality of these items. All the pieces are well made, super adorable and work great! I especially loved the electric pencil sharpener, beacase it lets me sharpen a lot of pencils without getting my hands dirty. But all the items are great quality, nice colors, clear print. They look great. This is perfect for girls/women for work, school, at home and will make an excellent gift, as well! I'm going to buy a couple more sets as Christmas gifts for my nieces.",

                "reviewText": "It comes packaged very nicely. Everything is nice and snug and organized. The erasers are in a little plastic case that won't hold up, so we'll have to put them in a baggy. I also sincerely doubt that they will last long. They are small, and my 6-year-old makes a lot of mistakes. The sharpener is a tight fit for the pencil, but it is cute, and my daughter loves that it is automatic. We haven't used the vacuum yet, but OH MY GOSH! I am most excited for that. So many pencil shavings and tiny pieces of paper get left on her desk. The pencils don't have erasers, which isn't surprising because it comes with the automatic eraser. It has finger holds, which I always find useless because their value depends on where you are at with sharpening. The little notebook is so cute, as are the paper clips. I wish there were more paper clips. I am not sure what we will do with the origami paper since neither of us knows how to do origami, but I can see her cutting them into shapes. She has plenty of scissors, and these have no metal blade, so I am sure she will stick with the ones she has, but these will be good to throw in her travel bag. They seem safer. Overall I am happy with this and think it's adorable.",
