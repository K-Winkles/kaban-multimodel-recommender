I also think the ink flow on these is very satisfying, it's a nice wet, black ink that comes out pretty thick. The only thing I dislike is that the metal pen point is easily pulled out of the end of the pen. They come with a red wax covering the pen point, and half the time when you try to pull it off, it pulls the entire metal point out, getting ink everywhere. Not my favoite feature. Overall, I still like the pen though, just be careful when you remove the red wax.",
