I like the little silver ball thing on the clip too- it\u2019s a nice fidget. Great price for what you get these pens are NICE",

High quality and feeling to the pens. They fit very well in a pencil case. They're so smooth and pretty. Def worth the purchase!!",

                "reviewText": "Let's discuss the features: 1.) The casing (for lack of a better word) is a soft, velvety smooth feeling. 2.) The metal ball you see on the clip actually rotates, and is a perfect accessory for those who are fidgety like myself, and an alternative to clicking 999+ times a day. 3.) Unlike most pens with cool features, the pen's writing quality is not sacrificed. It writes as smoothly as your favorite name brand pen that you pay 3x more for.",
