The picture on Amazon shows 2 black ink pens, plus two blue and one each red, green and purple. However, I received 4 black, and one each blue, green, red & purple. OTHER REVIEWERS HAVE ALSO REPORTED THIS ISSUE, SO IT IS NOT UNIQUE TO ME AND SHOULD BE CORRECTED. JUST A HEADS UP TO OTHER POTENTIAL BUYERS! That said, I will keep THEM, because I love the purple, green, red & blue pens. BigBill",
