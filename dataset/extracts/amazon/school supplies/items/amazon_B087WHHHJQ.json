I have used every single bag I have bought and I always need more. I have a bag filled with personal grooming tools I use on an daily basis for the last 3 years and the bag is still in great working order. I have had less than 5 bag failures in over 100+ bags, Only 1 was a faulty zipper. I am in awe at how well these bags last and hold up. As I said I use every single one rapidly when bought and I always need more. Amazing bags. I also use these bags for camping items and equipment and they last in the woods well too. The zipper bags keep rain away from my toilet paper and bugs out of my stuff. The ability to store and section off medical items also makes camping, hunting and all other outdoor activities much safer. I love these bags and I'm certain you will too.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought these plastic mesh pouches to organize one of my deep kitchen drawers that was filled to the brim with uncategorized miscellaneous items, making this my biggest junk drawer in the house. But since this drawer is close to my back patio sliding doors, it makes it a prime real-estate area to store items that you want to grab and go when you are leaving the house, so I knew I had to find a viable solution on how to store these items in a way that makes them easy to find, and easy to access.I chose these specific pouches because of their clear translucent design, as they make it easier to identify what their content is. I liked that they came in multiple sizes, because it is often difficult to predict how much space you will be needing when you are organizing. The pouches are made of sturdy PVC and their sturdy black zipper closures makes them easy to open and close. They can be very versatile and can be used for storing a variety of items, such as office supplies, toiletries, beauty products, toys, craft supplies and whatnot. They are very practical to organize with around your house, and are super useful for travel.~~~~~~~~ What I store in mine : ~~~~~~~~I use them all over my house, but for this drawer specifically, I used them to store and organize disposable shower caps (that I use for shoe covers and to cover food plates and bowls). They also hold my kitchen-related instruction manuals, a mix of reusable bags and pouches, some reusable face masks, and a backup of disposable face masks.They are also great for holding board games items, seasonal decor, and they make great travel first aid kits. They are sturdy, the zippers are smooth, and they can be wiped clean very easily. These are an organizing staple of mine, and in my opinion, they are well worth the price. Great purchase. Would recommend.If my review was helpful let me know by clicking on the ''Helpful'' button bellow :) \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
