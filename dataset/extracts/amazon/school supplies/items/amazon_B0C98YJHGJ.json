I specifically bought this notebook as it was advertised as \u201chard cover.\u201d The cover is a somewhat see-through plastic that is fairly flexible. I believe it will still hold up well, but you can see anything written on the first page through the cover. I downgraded to 4 stars for this reason, as there was no indication in any description or picture that the cover would not be opaque. In the picture you can see that writing on the first page shows clearly through the cover.",
