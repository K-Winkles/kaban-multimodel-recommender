They have little cat paws on them and the top of the barrel is a darker shade to the bottom of the barrel, with the exception of the brown pen. the brown colored pen has a black top.These pens click and so you can make sure that when you\u2019re done using them, to click again so the pen nib goes back up into the barrel. These actually feel really nice in the hand and they have a smooth feel to them. The cat paw is a very soft silicone material that provides some comfort while I\u2019m writing.This is a gel pen, and the ink is black. It writes really smoothly without smudging. These look very cute and they work very well. These would make fantastic stocking stuffers",

Pull the tab and the insert holding the pens slides out (see photo).The pen has a very fine tip (like my go-to black pen, the Uniball Signo Micro 207) and moves smoothly across the page. The ink is a dark black and dries reasonably fast (though not as fast as the Uniball's). The body is made from a soft-touch plastic, the cap from a regular (hard touch) plastic. The feel in hand is acceptable (not as nice as the Uniball).In summary: they are very cute, work perfectly well, and are quite cute.Disclosure: I received this item for free.
