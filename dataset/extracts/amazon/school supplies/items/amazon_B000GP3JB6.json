Good value for money, the scissors seem strong and they cut well (sample tested; not used by kids yet). The packaging arrived damaged. See next for what I did to adapt the box for storage.Advertised as \u2018with Storage Rack\u2019 - this is misleading! If you want to use this for \u2018storage\u2019, don\u2019t take off the cellophane (inside the box and around the scissors). Instead, just cut off the top, around the handles (see photo). I have also kept the bottom of the outer box to give it some sturdiness (see photo).The delivery was in a sturdy paper envelope. The box inside arrived damaged and flattened. I sellotaped the edges and manually pushed the box back into shaped so that the box stands by itself.",
