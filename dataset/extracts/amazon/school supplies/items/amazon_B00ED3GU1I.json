                "reviewText": "I am a writer and have all kinds of note pads and journals around. I am also the most unorganized person alive. I need to write everything down and then I need help finding where I wrote it. These Sticky Notes help me to find what I am looking for fast and easily. The pages are of medium weight and have an adhesive strip down the side. I didn't think the adhesive would actually stick well but I have had no problems at all with it drying out or any of my notes falling out of my notebooks. I like that I can peel back the note and see what is written under it rather than having the entire backing be sticky.The tabs could be a tad more reinforced but these aren't made to be actual tabs but more like reminder tabs. There's plenty of space to write on and the colors are bright and vivid. I didn't even know these existed until I was searching for other organizing items and these popped up. I took a chance and bought a pack and now I use them all the time. They can be a bit pricey so just watch for the price to go down. Prices do fluctuate. I think they're well worth what I paid which is $3.99 as an add on item. I would pay up to $5.00 a pack for them but I wouldn't go over that. They are just paper and there's only 60 pages so I encourage you to do a little price checking. Nonetheless, I am going with 5 stars because I am very happy with these notes and they have made my life a little easier and that is always a god thing.",

                "reviewText": "I love these sticky notes but they have one fatal flaw. The stickiness is all along the underside of the left-hand edge (unlike the top edge on regular sticky notes), which allows you to flip to the other side of the sticky note as if you were turning the page of a book. This is great. And the notes come in plastic holder in book form. However, because the sticky notes are grouped by color and all together in one pad, you can't access the other colors without completely removing the upper layers of sticky notes, if you get what I mean. They are in yellow- orange- pink- green- purple order, so if I want anything other than yellow, I have to break apart the pad to access that color. Not that big a deal, but it messes with the pretty little book-like stack of sticky notes.That said, they are really useful. I have a planner which has some blank pages in the back. Those pages invariably run out, or else I want to add extra notes to a page, and I can use these sticky notes. I also home school my daughter, and I can write comments on the sticky note instead of on her assignments; she can also use them to make notes in her textbooks. I love them! Good price too.",

                "reviewText": "I like to surf for recipes on my phone and then make a shopping list. It's dang hard to tab back and forth from recipe site to my Keepnotes app. These sticky notes, which I actually got because I take a lot of notes in books, have been unexpectedly helpful to make recipe notes as well. I don't use a recipe book, but I can write the name of the recipe on the tab and then stack them; they adhere well and it's easy to unstick and restick them. If you need a larger surface for making notes, give these a try, great value for the cost.",

                "reviewText": "These sticky notes are excellent. They come in a booklet, with a clear cover over and a card-like paper with a blue mandala pattern at the back, which is really neat and beautiful. The colors are quite neon and bright and look exactly as the picture shows. The tabs are neat and noticeable at any angle, and are 2.4 cm or about 0.8 inches in length. The paper note itself is 14.8 cm or 5.8 inches in length. They came in neatly and safely packaged, with no dirt or paper creasing in sight.To me, every student or teacher in high school or college should own these, and many business men or women should too. They're extremely useful for taking down important notes, lesson/project/essay/test/other planning, and generally placing important information down on a note that won't misplace itself in your planner or notebook.The colors are bright! Really easy to notice as it stands out to any color. I have the blue note placed over a dark pastel blue page from my notebook (from Slethoscope) and is much darker than the pastel. The lines to each note are dark, but largely spaced. If they were were spaced a little tighter, then it would have been much better in forms of how much you get to write, but since lots of people have large handwriting, this would seem quiet convenient. I have a little smaller handwriting, so I wish they were less line spacing. Anywho, this is really insignificant and works amazing for what I bought it for!I will keep this in my book bag and carry them with me to school and lessons. I will definitely repurchase as soon as I come near to running out.",

                "reviewText": "The colors are vibrant. The adhesive is good, ability to pull off to align/move. Doesn\u2019t rip the paper when removing. Clean & clearly marked lines to write, but light enough to write over clearly as well. The tabs are a decent size for short words, a few letters or small writing. The cover is clear plastic in front and a semi stiff card stock paper on the back. The notes are bound from the back with the cardboard backing wrapped around the side to the front and then the front clear cover is held in place along with the bound notes by a blue strip of adhesive tape.If you choose to use the top/first color note please rip gently, from the top and I found it easier to rip it downwards vs outwardly.If choosing a color (other than the top note page)( unfortunately this is the only downside I\u2019ve noticed)you\u2019ll have to open the little notebook and bit wider than you probably should have to. But again it\u2019s because of the way the pages need to be removed.They\u2019re kinda costly for only getting 60, if you\u2019re only doing a small project or just for organizing and reusing them heck why not I\u2019m an completely satisfied with mineGiven the cost of the 3M brand stickies or an off brand they\u2019re still going to be costly for what they are/do. If all else fails there\u2019s always the $1 store. Order online by the case!LoL",
