Nice to help keep track of things that need to be done and has that satisfying check box once the item is completed. I like the section to keep memories of what I am grateful for. I sometimes get too lazy/busy to keep a separate book but writing gratuity is one of the better things I do with my day. It is durable. Hard covers. Does not mash in a bag/carryall but I don't think I'd throw it in the bottom of my gym bag. Like a hardcover book but since it doesn't have as many pages as a book it could bend. It also has an elastic to keep a person's place in the journal and pockets for stuff. Or stuff to get lost in. :)",

Also the addition of a gratitude check in, water log and food log is stellar! I don\u2019t need multiple log books anymore which makes it so much easier to keep track.I cannot stress enough the importance of the to do list and the must get done today list! This really makes me reflect on the extensive lists I often create and what is the most important for that day. 100/10 recommend",
