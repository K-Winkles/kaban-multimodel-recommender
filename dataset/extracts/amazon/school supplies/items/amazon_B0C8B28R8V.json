It is easy to bring with you on the go and the zippers make sure nothing falls out or moved around too much.I really like that it is easy to get things in and out without having to dig around. The quality is pretty durable especially for its size and lower cost.",

The quality of the fabric is good and we'll have to wait and see how it holds up the rest of they year. Including the fact it's a light color so we will be seeing crayon stains soon enough. But a good buy I might add for any kid over the age of 8.",

My mom is a teacher and so I end up getting a LOT of pens and pencils from her and my pencil pouch was getting a bit too tight to hold all of my supplies. I love the extra pouches on the sides for ink refills, lead refills, etc., and the pouch on the inside has little slots to put your favorite pens and pencils for easy access so you don\u2019t have to go around digging for your favorites. We all have a favorite pen or pencil, and now getting to it is easier than ever.",
