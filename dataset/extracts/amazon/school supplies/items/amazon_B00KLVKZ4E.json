                "reviewText": "I bought these for my four-year-old grandson. This was the third pair of scissors I tried with him, and they helped him learn to enjoy activities involving scissors.Their ergonomic design gently guides his hand into the proper position. The lower handle loop is pretty large on these scissors. That lets my grandson use all his fingers to control the scissors. This makes a huge difference for a young child who has not practiced enough to develop strength in the muscles needed for scissor action and who is still developing fine motor skills. I have observed his hand muscles getting stronger as he keeps practicing, but he didn't want to practice when he had scissors with two identical handle loops. Identical handle loops made cutting a real struggle for him and confused him about how to properly hold the scissors; these problems vanished with the kids' Fiskars. Crafts involving scissors are now among his favorite things to do.Another advantage to the relatively large handles led to me purchasing a second pair soon after the first pair arrived. Although they are not as comfortable for adults as adult-sized scissors, both my husband and I are able to use these kids' Fiskars, so we are able to do scissors projects with our grandson. My own adult scissors are super, super sharp, and I don't want them anywhere around a preschooler, plus I don't want to dull them cutting paper, so I'm glad our adult-sized fingers can fit into the handles of these children's scissors.Be advised that although these kids' Fiskars can be ordered with blunt tips to increase safety, the blades themselves are sharper than most children's scissors, though the blades are specially angled to increase safety. Although I feel confident in the safety of letting my grandson keep his other style of children's scissors in his own desk drawer, these Fiskars scissors live in the family project drawer and are only used with adult supervision. Because they are sharp enough to be effective, they are less frustrating to use than most other children's scissors. The potential downside is that this also gives them the power to cut cloth or skin or hair if you work at it, although we have never had that happen in the eight months these two pair of kids' Fiskars have been in our home. Know your child and supervise him or her until your child develops the maturity and wisdom to use these scissors responsibly. The description recommends ages four and up, but, as I said, know your child.I have noticed that now my grandson ALWAYS comes to me or Grandpa and asks for supervision, rather than using either of the less effective scissors he is allowed to keep in his own desk drawer. Its probably time to do a little decluttering and move the less effective scissors out of our lives. Our two pairs of blunt tip Fiskars get more use by both kids and adults than any other scissors in our household. Highly recommend, but supervise young children.",
