I have lots of trouble writing because of a botched thumb surgery in my right hand and also arthritis in general and my hand tends to cramp up very quickly. I was thrilled to find these because I can write much longer using these without this happening. I also can't keep them for myself because everytime I use one someone notices how pretty they write and soft they feel that I can't help giving one away. I bought several boxes as stocking stuffers for Christmas. They were a big hit and now my whole family uses them! As I said before, I love a nice looking pen that writes beautifully like these do and they are very affordable as well. No complaints here!!! I recommend them highly.",
