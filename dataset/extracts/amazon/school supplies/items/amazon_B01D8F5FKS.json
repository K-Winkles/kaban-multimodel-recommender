I love how they stick to almost any surface. I have tried other brands, but their adhesion is not as strong as Post-its, and I lose them.I also enjoy that they came out with more colors and sizes, making it easier to organize your notes and even organize discussions that I have with coaching clients. I like to use them during 1:1 sessions to brainstorm and then organize my thoughts -- the colors are great to help keep things interesting and they make great photos to send as follow-ups after the session.",

Short square stacks are regular adhesive. All-blue column is 2 similar colors.PICTURE = NAMED COLLECTIONS: The same color can be in multiple collections. The same set of colors may be sold under multiple names (Oasis or Bora Bora). Cabinet packs contain only 4 of a collection's 5 or 6 colors. Some \"same-looking\" colors are similar, not the same. Are you confused yet?Quality seems high. Post-It stickiness is better than other brands I've tested, with less curling or coming loose. Super Sticky notes are stickier than regular Post-Its & harder to peel off my whiteboard.Minus 1 star for making names, colors, and what one is purchasing confusing, and for not offering a full range of 1-color bulk packs. For project boards (kanban) I want a decent array of visually distinct colors, with identical colors in large and small stickies. What I got includes colors that are visually similar enough to confuse, and large and small stickies whose colors don't match.",

My students get excited when they see them out because they know something fun is going to happen! We use them in games, as \"do now\" math problems, exit tickets, and more. The adhesive on a Post-it is far superior to off name sticky notes. The dry erase boards We have in classrooms have almost a greasy finish to them that makes other sticky notes fall off and flutter to the floor like fall leaves! Post-it Notes are the only brand that stick to the dry erase white board, even overnight! Totally worth the extra price over no name notes! \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb",
