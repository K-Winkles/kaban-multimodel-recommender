                "reviewText": "I purchased these as part of my daughter's school supply list. It was a great price for a pack of 12. And Elmer's has been the biggest name in the glue market, even when I was I young lad. No reason it is the number 1 teacher's brand.This glue is easy to use, especially compared to glue in a bottle. It goes on easy you just have to be willing to accept that if you want to cover the edges of whatever you are gluing then you will more than likely go over whatever is under it with the glue stick. I still find that it goes on smooth and is pretty clean, and easy to control. It goes on purple so that you can see exactly where you are putting it and it dries clear. It is not the best adhering glue, but it is good enough for school work and crafts. Sometimes that has even worked in my favor, where I was able to reposition what I was gluing, after I had placed it.This was a bargin for some high quality glue sticks. I am sure that I will be purchasing more next school year.",

I'll be honest this price is just about the same as Wal-Mart but I'm a prime member and live 45 minutes from Wal-Mart so it was just easier to have them delivered in 2-3 days. If you've never used these, they aren't messy, there is no smell, they're easy to use, they're sticky without the mess like regular glue. And the kids aren't putting glue on their hands waiting for it to dry so they can peel it off, lol!",
