But we now have 30 elmers glue sticks. Maybe someday they'll find use for them as we already have alot. The box did come damaged/broken where they were all inside the bag they came in, but that was more of a delivery problem vs shipping problem I'm guessing. Because of the damaged box we didn't return as didn't wanna send back scattered everywhere. That entire order came in damaged from mail carrier.",
