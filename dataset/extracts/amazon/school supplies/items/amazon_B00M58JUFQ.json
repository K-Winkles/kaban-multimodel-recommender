                "reviewText": "I really like these highlighters. I was a university student when i first tried these and now I'm on my 3rd set of these that i've ordered off amazon over the past 2 years or so. I've tried out other types of highlighters (including others from the Sharpie brand) and I have always come back to these.Reasons why I love these highlighters so much:1) The clear window allows you to see what you are highlighting as you go along - saving you time on studying and reading: with these highlighters, you can see exactly what you are highlighting as you go along and read. You can also stop highlighting exactly where you want too. My main issue with other highlighters is that you cannot see past the area next to where your highlighter sits on the page as you highlight, making you lose your place, highlight words you don't want, or highlight into the margins because you think there are more words in a paragraph, etc. Not dealing with these frustrations as well as being able to do a bit of 'skim reading' and highlighting has helped me save a lot of time.2) Just the right amount of colour and ink: These markers are not 'watery' or bleed through paper like some highlighters do. The amount of ink in the highlighter seems just right and you don't get ink seeping through when you have pressed your marker on the page too long. Colours are your typical highlighter pink, green, yellow, and orange.3) Nice shape and made of nice, slightly grippy material: these highlighters aren't made of the shiny type of plastic like most... They have almost a matt finish which allows you to grip better.Cons to these highlighters:1) Not long lasting: The one big downfall to these is that I have found that they do not last long. When i was studying for exam I had to replace these. Now that i'm out of school and using them more for work/personal purposes this has not been a problem.Overall, these are really good highlighters that have been designed with user's needs in mind. appreciate they aren't just a marketing bi-produt of Sharpie. You simply can't find any highlighters that compare!- I really love highlighters...",
