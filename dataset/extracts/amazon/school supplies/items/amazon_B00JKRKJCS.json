I brought it to use at work to log sales, calls and inventory to keep everything in one notebook rather than having 3 running at once, less mess less clutter. It fits nicely in the corner of our work bench, not too thick to keep me from being able to work, but thick enough to have substance and not feel like it\u2019s going to fall apart any second",

                "reviewText": "The Five Star Spiral Notebook + Study App is a game-changer for anyone who wants to stay organized and on top of their studies. The notebook features three subjects and 150 sheets of college-ruled paper, providing plenty of space for note-taking and homework assignments.What sets this notebook apart is the accompanying study app. The app allows you to scan the pages of the notebook and save them as digital files, which you can then organize and access on your phone or tablet. This feature is incredibly useful for keeping all of your notes in one place and being able to access them anywhere.The notebook itself is also well-made. The spiral binding is sturdy and the paper is thick and high-quality, with a clean white color and clear ruling. The pages are perforated, which makes it easy to tear out individual sheets if needed.Overall, I would highly recommend the Five Star Spiral Notebook + Study App to anyone who wants to stay organized and efficient in their studies. The combination of a high-quality notebook and a useful study app is a winning combination, and the price is very reasonable for the value you receive. If you're a student or anyone who wants to keep their notes and assignments organized, this notebook is definitely worth considering.",
