The on/off button can be found either as a toggle switch on the back or a push button on the topChoose your pouch setting, either 3 mil or 5 mil depending on the thickness of the pouch you are working withWarm up times can take between 1-6 minutes depending on your machine, your machine is warm enough to start laminating once the ready light illuminatesIf your machine has a feeding tray, ensure it is extended in the ready position Step 2: Place Place your project inside the laminating pouch. Center your item inside the pouch checking that you leave laminate margin on every side for best sealing resultsHave some fun with it by stacking multiple layers of colorful paper, confetti or lettering on top of one another Step 3: Insert Place the Sealed End of the pouch into the machine, with the open end following behind. Check to make sure the pouch lines up to the opening to prevent an uneven or angled feed throughRemove any objects that could get in the way of your project as it feeds out of the machine Step 4: Seal Let the laminator do its thing! Avoid pulling or obstructing the pouch as it feeds through the laminator Your project will be hot when it exits the machine so use caution Helpful tip: Cut/trim pouches only after feeding through the machine",

This laminator is a game-changer for my home office and crafting projects. It heats up quickly, allowing me to start laminating in no time.The sleek white design adds a modern touch to my workspace, and its compact size makes it easy to store when not in use. I appreciate the two-roller system, which ensures that my documents come out smooth and bubble-free.One of the standout features is the jam release lever, which saved me a lot of frustration during my first few uses. The simplicity of operation is a major plus, making it user-friendly even for those who are not tech-savvy.Overall, the Scotch TL901X Thermal Laminator has exceeded my expectations. It's reliable, efficient, and has become an essential tool in my daily tasks. I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a quality laminator for home or small office use.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this when it was a daily Amazon special and am so happy I did! I've used it to laminate aging sheet music and to protect recipes from the ravages of kitchen spills. Both were easily and quickly done, with great results.The Laminator:It's a lightweight, small footprint device that is very simple to operate. On/Off switch, a release lever to use if the item you are laminating jams, and a 3mm or 5mm switch - relates to the thickness of whatever you are laminating; use the 5mm for thick paper or two regular sheets of paper which are back to back. The 5mm setting is the hottest and the machine takes about 8 minutes to heat up for initial use at this setting.When placing two regular sheets of paper back to back (with recipes on each side), inserting them in the 9 x 12 pouches with the crease into the machine first (any bubbles escape out the open end), I was able to laminate my project in less than 10 seconds. Very quick and easy, and the front end (the part that comes out of the machine first) is cool to the touch with the end out last cooling off in approximately 15 seconds.The laminator remains hot and after multiple sheets, I noticed no change in the output quality of this laminator.The Pouches:The laminating pouches that are used with this machine come in several brands including the Scotch brand. All are on Amazon and you can choose smaller sizes than the 2 large sized ones that come with this unit, but I'd suggest the same size and if you choose to laminate two smaller items you can simply use one pouch and cut the final sheet into two.Tips:Make sure when you are laminating that you have at least a quarter inch around the item you are laminating so that the pouch can adhere to itself - sealing the sides and protecting your item. If you leave the item sticking out, proper adhesion can't occur.Don't put lumpy items in the machine to be laminated. This will jam the machine and won't get the item laminated!Overall, it's a great item for under twenty dollars, and the only real costs are in the laminating pouches so shop around and get the best deal. Some on Amazon include: 5 mil Letter hot Laminating Pouches 100/box 9\" x 11.5\" glossy thermal laminator pockets , Clear Laminating Pouches, 5 mil, 2-1/4\" x 3-3/4\", , and Scotch(TM) Thermal Laminating Pouches, 9 Inches x 11.4 Inches, 50 Pouches (TP3854-50) . Check 'em out to see what works best for your needs, but all will work with this super-easy to use, quality laminator.UPDATE: July 25, 2011I've been using this product to laminate back to back sheets of recipes, printed on regular printer paper. It works great! Using a 3-hole punch I then put my recipes into a 3-ring binder to have handy in the kitchen. If a page gets wet, I simply wipe it off and keep going. School awards and artwork get the same treatment before being put into safe-keeping.All in all, this is one of the best products I've ever purchased for home and office use. Highly recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "I needed to quickly laminate 100 sheets of paper. This device is small, quiet and pretty fast. It heated up and was ready to use in approximately 4 minutes. Full size sheets of paper took appx 45 to 50 seconds each to laminateIt took a little practice to load the paper into each pouch due to static cling but once you get the hang of it, it goes pretty quick. A great item for the money.",

                "reviewText": "I had been debating getting a laminater for a while, and finally decided to get this one. I had used this one a couple of times after borrowing it from a friend and liked it so that helped me make my decision. I've had it for about a month and a half and haven't had any issues with it yet. I use it to laminate visuals for the families that I work with and the lamination is great quality! Super quick and easy to use. Takes a couple of minutes to heat up but not too long of a wait.",

I also laminate signs that my husband uses in the garage and use it to preserve articles and papers from kids artwork to insurance cards.",
