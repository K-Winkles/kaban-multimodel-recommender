                "reviewText": "I think the pencil case is the best part of this set. It's so sweet and perfect for a 6yr old. It comes with a neat cross body carry strap. My daughter loves taking this case with her on road trips. It's a must have on those days her brother is busy with a piano lesson or jujitsu. It's a very well organized case too, which makes it so much easier for her to find which coloring tools she wants.The markers work very well and produce strong bold colors. The twistable crayons are much preferred to regular ones that break after the first use. The scented markers have a faint but pleasant scent. Maybe my sense of smell isn't good, but it's difficult for me to distinguish between the various scents.Overall, everything included works well. The stickers are a nice bonus. I think this set is very good value for the price. It would also make an excellent gift for someone. I highly recommend it!",

I host a Christmas Eve party that is open to anyone who has nowhere else to be, so every year I get an extra family or 2 who stop by. I like to keep extra gifts on hand so when Santa comes, every kid gets a gift, not just my family members. This is great because it will cover a decent range of children, I'd say at least 4-7 years old. It has all types of color utensils (luckily I have extra lap white boards I can add to this), stickers, and although it technically has coloring sheets....they are not great. I will probably add a cute coloring book to round out this gift. The carrying case is nice, the zipper works. I'm happy with this.",

You can use it as a school penicil case as well as it has detachable strap, but with the strap, it should be great for travel! It comes with stickers, crayons, pens, scented markers, paint pens and washable markers. A great set for young kids who love to color. And once the markers run out of ink, simply replace them and continue to use the case. I can definitely recommend this one.",

                "reviewText": "First of all, the description uses the word horse several times. They are really unicorns. I think my 5-year old niece will enjoy these. They will be a fun addition to her coloring books that she loves already. They also describe the case as a bag, but it is actually a sturdy case made of the rubber-feeling plastic. It is divided into two sections and will hold a little more than the 28 markers, 12 crayons, stickers, and cute little coloring book that is about 3\"x3\" with maybe 4-6 pages.I took a star off because I opened a couple of each of the markers, and although they wrote great, I wasn't sure which of them were the ones that were scented.",
