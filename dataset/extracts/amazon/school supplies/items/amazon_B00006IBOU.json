I recently switched to a school that is not so willing to purchase materials, so I had to buy a set for myself this year. They are the best option if you plan on using colored pencils for a classroom or other group situations. Crayola is the best hands down because they are smoother and generally more durable, and this is a good value for them. They are especially great during pandemic teaching because you can break them up into 20 sets of twelve and then almost every kid gets their own mini bundle and we don\u2019t have to share. Usually, I put rubber bands around a set of twelve and hand them out like that, but I haven\u2019t had time yet this year. But still, highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I am a high school teacher, tired of buying little packs of colored pencils for projects and creative activities in class. This is by far the best deal, for in my opinion, a high quality colored pencil (besides artist sets) for the price. The box is perfect, but do keep in mind the other reviews about opening the packaging carefully as the pencils can slide around. Since the box is prone to be bent or twisted, I placed most colored pencils to be used in separate containers sorted by color. So far, on the first day of school, they work great and sharpen well. I will certainly buy this again over what is offered in stores.",
