The pencil has a nice heft to it and for sure is solid metal and not just plated plastic or some lighter metallic material. The erasers included as well are of good quality, and even self cleaning to an extent. I have yet to see graphite stick to the surface and need to be scrapped off by more than lightly running my thumb along the top. The packaging as well is slick and considerate, with a little self-care message included with the purchase that helps if this is also your first quality pencil purchase.My one gripe is that the material is rather slippery compared to what I am used to, and after writing for an extended period of time any amount of sweat will cause your hand to slip a little bit.",

                "reviewText": "I got these because I wanted a mechanical pencil that was more \u201cprofessional\u201d looking. These are definitely very sleek and write well. I really like the lead that it provided with the pack. The big stand alone erasers are also of great quality. The only negative is the erasers on the pencil itself. They are very flimsy and don\u2019t do a great job of actually erasing things. I primarily just make sure to have the bigger eraser nearby and don\u2019t use the one on the pencil because of this. It seems this is something that most of these types of mechanical pencils have in common though :/Overall, a really great pencil that is very aesthetically appealing and of great quality.",

They are comfortable to hold, but have more weight to them than the cheap plastic mechanical pencil I had been using. They are easy to load, and will take up to three leads at a time, making it more time in between refills. In addition to the four pencils there are large erasers, erasers for the pencil lead, and several boxes of lead. This box will keep me writing happily for a long time.",
