Shortly after being attached to the board, the holder slides sideways and dumps the eraser on the floor. The other one I ordered works but is not that strong. Never occurred to me that such a simple product - particularly the vendor's own - might be an 'out of box' failure when used with their own magnetic board....so I had thrown away the packaging. So I'll have to head down to the store, buy a decent neodynium magnet, and waste an hour and a half fixing this - or simply throw it out.",
