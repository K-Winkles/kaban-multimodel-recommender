This could be solved by tucking the tail in but it can become a pain after a while, and leaving it out can get stuck on somethings. Other than that this is such a great pencil case! It fits all of my pencils, calculator, and notepads, along with many highlighters and colored pencils! Love this product and would absolutely recommend it!",
