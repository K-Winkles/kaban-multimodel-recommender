I bought 70 to give away in goody bags for my kids classmates, there were going to be a few extra so I let my kids pick out which ones they wanted, and let me tell you it was a hard decision making process! They are all so cute. I might even buy another box just for us now \ud83d\ude09",

I was worried this would be a gimmick and the \u201c70\u201d pieces would refer to, say, the three pieces each that make up each animal, but I received literally 70 erasers. There are animals, vehicles, and food mostly. They do get dirty and fall apart if not taken care of, but that\u2019s to be expected. My students like them.",
