The tabs were bent and worn and one of the sections had been broken off the little organizer itself. The adhesive is stick, almost too sticky. It ends up ripping the sticky note underneath it and causes the paper to bend when you place it onto other surfaces. I love the colors and variety, just wish the quality held up as well.",
