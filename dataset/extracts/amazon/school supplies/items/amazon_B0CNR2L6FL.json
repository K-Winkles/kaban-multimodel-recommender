                "reviewText": "I LOVE my huge box of sticky notes! My life is completely contained on sticky notes - I leave them everywhere to remind me of everything and I love my system. Gel pens and sticky notes are my jam and I make no apologies, although my colleagues who are all about digital organization side-eye my bright splashes of information with disdain haha.2500 sticky notes are going to last me awhile, but that's okay because this box comes with 8 really gorgeous colors. The pink, yellow, and blue are bold while the remaining colors are pastel, so I can choose the color based on the urgency of the information on the note.I have always used the OG name-brand (and spendy) sticky notes...in fact, this is my first order of non-name brand P.I. notes, and the stickiness of these notes is indeed slightly less than the brand names ones. So far the slightly less-adhesive nature of these sticky notes has not been reason for less than 5 stars but I will update my review should they warrant a fallen star. Overall, I've been moving these notes around and the adhesive is holding just fine. They are just not as hard to pull off of my notepads and other surfaces as the original brand, but they do keep on sticking.So if you are like me and love your system of organizing your work life, home life, shopping life, busy run-around-town life, etc., these will delight you and serve you well too.",

                "reviewText": "These little squares of joy have added a splash of creativity and organization to my daily routine. From neon pinks to calming blues, the variety in colors is not only aesthetically pleasing but also serves a functional purpose, color-coding my tasks has never been easier. I really like and appreciate the storage box they came in as well to keep them in great shape.What I love most is the sheer number of sticky notes in this pack. With 32 pads and 8 different vibrant options, I feel like I have a color for every mood and every project. The adhesive is strong enough to stick on my project boards, desk, or planner without leaving any sticky residue behind. Plus, the compact size, 3\" x 3\", of each note makes them perfect for jotting down quick reminders or highlighting important details in my work. They are great for Kanban because you have more than enough colors to work with to represent your processes and projects.Trust me, if you're a stationery enthusiast or just someone looking to inject a bit of fun into your workspace, this 32 Pack of sticky notes is a must-have! It's like a burst of creativity every time I reach for one, and I can't imagine my desk without them now.",

The colors are very well done and match up with the images in the advertisement. The box I had received was a little beat up and bent up on stack, the overall pads received were good. The adhesion of the notes is pretty good, but I feel that most of these types of notepads aren't the \"stickiest\". So these may not stay put...Lots of pads, lots of great colors and should last just about anybody a good deal of time.",

My needs do not require long term usage. I use sticky notes for short term tasks... reminders, a quick phone number, a grocery list, or to tag a document in a pile of papers. Then, so long! So I really don't care if they are a bit less in quality. They are still perfectly functional for my needs. For me this is a better deal for something I don't need for long. My only real criticism here is the dark blue is a tad too dark... I prefer the lightest and brightest colors myself for the best readability. But it's not a dealbreaker. And I love the color blue, so matter really. Recommended.",

They are a pretty basic size as well. They come all separated in their specific colors. If I needed more, I would easily reorder.",

                "reviewText": "Does it sound silly to tell you that I was excited when these arrived? I love color and I love organization, so this was a happy purchase for me. The sticky notes are exactly like the name brand that made these famous. They came in a nice box which will work well for storage for the many years it will take me to use all of these. The stickiness is great. I tested this by using one paper and stuck it to paper, lifted it, and stuck in down again. I did this 50 times and it was still sticking. Finally, the colors are gorgeous. If you look at the photo of the notes inside the box, you can see them lightly reflected in the box lid. Enjoy!",

                "reviewText": "If you use a lot of sticky notes, these should do the trick. They stayed stuck to the glass and painted wood I put them on when I pressed the adhesive down well with my fingernail. I tested them overnight and in the morning they were still as tight as they were from the start. If I didn't go the extra mile and just lightly press them in place, they would fall off after about half an hour. I've had knockoff Post-Its that would never stay put no matter how much pressure I applied to the adhesive strip so these passed the test much better. I would recommend them.",

I stuck one to my monitor on Friday and by Monday is was sitting on my desk and will not stay stuck to anything. Longer lasting glue is necessary for these to be worth purchasing.",
