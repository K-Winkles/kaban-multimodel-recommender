These highlighters are not markers- they are more like soft crayons- which is why they work so well on Bible pages! They are all fairly bright and vibrant. Additionally, it doesn't take much, so a little of these go a long way. These should last for quite awhile. I highly recommend.",

The points are thick, so it is difficult to highlight single sentences if the print is small. It works well in books with larger print. It definitely isn't a gel though.",

I strongly recommend these! Although I should\u2019ve purchased the brighter colors, I obviously wasn\u2019t paying attention. These are nice just very subtle.",

When I saw the highlighters offered by Diversbee that came in a package of multiple highlighters and in such desirable colors, I just had to have them. I chose the Dusty set. Eight beautiful colors. They are so smooth and creamy. No flakes, no smudge, no leaking to the other side of my Bible page, and easy to read through what has just been highlighted. I also ordered a package for my granddaughter. She didn't have a Bible of her own so I bought her one and made sure she had the set of highlighters. I just might have to come back and order the other sets as well. The box size will also be perfect to drop down in a Christmas stocking. Thankyou for selling a quality product. I highly recommend!",

With my last set (a different brand), they were too waxy and covered up the words underneath. These are nice and sheer, but a couple of the colors do not show up very well (light pink and light beige). I will still be using the full set to study and highlight through my Bible this year, and I created a color coded bookmark that I have shared here if anyone else is interested in doing the same :). The most important thing is spending time with God each day, letting Him speak to us through His word and have conversations with Him in prayer. Blessings to all!",

                "reviewText": "However, these are the best Bible highlighters available today. I wasn't that stoked on this particular color set, but my youngest niece picked these out specifically for her Bible for Christmas, because she didn't WANT all the overly bright or pastel colored sets available. These are more Earth tones, but still do a great job. They don't bleed through delicate paper used to print many nicer Bibles today, and yet are very much permanent additions to your personal note taking.Sheerness is an important factor with Bible highlighters, as you need the ink to not make the text underneath illegible. This doesn't do that at all - it adds to the overall read, not take away by masking the text too hard to read.",
