We've gone through sooooo many markers this year because he is constantly loosing the tops...and even when he doesn't loose them, he lacks the dexterity to put them back on by himself.These markers are perfect. They have a buttery soft glide, fun, rich colors and best of all, click on and off like a pen. It took him about a day to figure the mechanism out and now he is super proud of being able to click them when he's done.They are pricier than regular markers but in the long term I think they will last sooooo much longer. They would make a great gift!",

However, it\u2019s not always easy for them to get the caps back on the markers and they dry out quickly, which in turn leads to purchasing a large number of markers. This product has really helped as they can just click it to use it and then click it again when they are done. And it\u2019s easy enough that you can do it with one hand. I would definitely recommend these. They are a little more than I would like to pay for markers but in the end I\u2019m not buying as many.",
