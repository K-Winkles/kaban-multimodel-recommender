                "reviewText": "I use index cards a lot. I use them for grocery lists, notes, little reminders for my wife and kid, just generally lots of things instead of a paper notepad.I had a whole bunch of note cards and I finally was running out and needed to resupply. I bought these(the Oxford brand) as I have found the brand names to be a little better quality. The price for 500 cards was really good, so I figured this was a pretty good choice. Unfortunately, it was not exactly what I expected.When I cracked open a package of the cards, I found them to be much thinner and more flimsy than the cards I had before. They were not \"paper thin\", but they were not like card stock either. I would describe them as kind of thick paper, versus what I normally think of a \"card stock\".Since I still had a few old cards, I could compare them directly and the new ones were much thinner. They will still do the job, but they just feel a lot less like cards and more like thick note paper in an index card format.I guess it is like so many other things now where manufacturers are cutting costs. it is kind of like the grocery store where the item you used to buy is still the same price, but there isn't as much product in the box. This feels a little like that. I will use these, but next time I will look for something that is a little more like the index card that I am accustomed to using...a little sturdier and thicker. And I am perfectly willing to pay a little more for better quality...This may or may not matter to you for your purposes, so please understand there is nothing \"wrong\" with them...they just aren't what I expected, so I am only rating them 4 stars out of 5.",
