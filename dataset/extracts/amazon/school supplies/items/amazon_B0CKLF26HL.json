I like that it keeps things organized, but it can be tough for her, 4 years old, to get the colors out that she needs. The larger markers are almost the same size as the zipper. Everything works great.Nothing is scented so I am not sure why that is advertised. Also the \"coloring book\" and \"drawing pad\" are very minimal. Wouldn't expect them to keep your child long for happy so have some more paper ready to go. I do recommend.",

Everything packs away neatly into this this eye catching sparkly pink zipper pouch. I love that all the little compartments have easy to open zippers to make for easy clean up and organization. I got this as a gift for my niece that is 3 years old and she loves it! The description states that markers are scented, when opening them I don't seem to smell any strong scents. If there are any scents they are very faint. In my opinion that did not take away from the set itself. Very giftable. 5 stars.",

Let's call it technique. I ordered this kit for the little so she could mash those felt tip markers to her little hearts delight with out interference from the older kid.Right away I was impressed with the carrying case. Glitter on top of glitter is our favorite color and this is beautifully sparkly. The variety of supplies inside is exactly as depicted in the item listing but seems more impressive in person. All the things worked and have great color saturation.The only downside i observed is nothing is scented. End of the day that's not a big deal for us but it could be important to others",

                "reviewText": "Got the Rocamdo Unicorn Fruit Scented Washable Colored Pencils Set for my nieces, and it is a delightful and comprehensive art supplies kit that exceeded my expectations. The 63-piece set comes with a vibrant array of colored pencils, each exuding a fruity scent that adds an extra layer of sensory enjoyment to the creative process. The washable feature is a game-changer, allowing for stress-free cleanup. The inclusion of a glitter pencil case is cute and ensures convenient storage and portability. This art kit is exceptionally well-suited for young artists, especially girls aged 4 to 9, offering a perfect balance of fun and educational value. From the quality of the colored pencils to the thoughtfully designed glitter case, this Rocamdo set makes for an ideal Christmas or birthday gift, fostering creativity and artistic exploration in a delightful and scented manner. My nieces actually ripped it open immediately on Christmas and began to color (all of the markers that they used worked really well).",

                "reviewText": "Is there someone in your life who is into unicorns and like to draw or color? This set will be the perfect gift for their birthday or Christmas. The entire collection is separated into 4 zippered pouch. The first pouch is the Watercolor Stampers. The second pouch is the SCENTED Watercolor pens. The 3rd pouch is the twistable crayons. The last pouch are the mini color pencils and mini SCENTED glitter pens. The mini items measure 3 inches long. Also included in the last pouch is a cheap pencil sharpener that looks really low quality. Outside the pouches, you get a coloring book, drawing pad, and several sheets of unicorn-themed stickers. The thickness of the coloring book and drawing pad is quite thin. When coloring on one page, you can see the backend of the other pack very easily.Packaging-wise, the entire pencil 'case' is placed in a clear plastic bag with no additional box or artwork.Overall, this is a decent off-brand set of art supplies. Would be nice if the scented items have a label stating what smell the ink has instead of leaving it a mystery.",
