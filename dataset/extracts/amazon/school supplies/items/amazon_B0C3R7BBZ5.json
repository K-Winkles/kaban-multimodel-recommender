I was sick of the obnoxious and fluorescent BRIGHT highlighters that are more commonly used. I wanted something more calming and aesthetically pleasing. These did not disappoint. I will say that a couple of the colors are very similar to each other, and you can barely tell the difference between them. So, if you\u2019re color coordinating things, it kind of limits your options. Still love \u2018em. I\u2019ve been using them consistently for over a month now, and none of them have run out. They\u2019re so cheap for the quality! Def reccomend.",
