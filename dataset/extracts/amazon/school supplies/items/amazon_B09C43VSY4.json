So, based on the above mentioned and other similar concerns and problems, you might come up with some requirements and preferences of the suitable highlighters for yourself: You would prefer non-neon and mild but vibrant highlighters, which provide a soft hue that is easy on the eyes and not distracting for comfortably reading through it, keeping calm and focused, You want assorted colors to easily group things, i.e., use each color to indicate a separate part of your needs or a different topic for keeping things organized and making it easier to look at and use when doing a word or phrase search, You want softer highlighters than usual to make sure the text still stays fully visible. Then it would be a nice try to have the Alohaster HPSIZEE-Series Highlighters.",

Furthermore, the ink was free-flowing. Based on the flat shape and the property of the ink, the highlighters can provide you with a pleasing smooth multi-color highlighting experience. No Bleed The ink of the cool pastel highlighters is water-based so that it can dry quickly. It won't bleed through pages under proper use unless you're using very thin papers or pressing highlighters very hard while using. Barely Smear The most secure way to avoid smearing problems perfectly is to highlight first and then write using gel pens, ballpoint pens, etc. If you want to hand-write before highlighting, it is better to use a ballpoint pen instead of a gel pen, as the ink of a ballpoint pen dries much faster than a gel pen. Also, try to avoid pens with a tip larger than 1.0 mm as they take longer time than usual to dry and are more likely to cause smudging.",

The highlighters are smooth and do NOT bleed through the thin bible pages. I was very please with the variety of colors. The variety of colors makes it easy to color code and keep my reading topics. The quality of the highlighters are very high. I actually look forward to reading and using these highlighters. The highlighters come in an adorable hard plastic case. However, the case mine came in does not stay closed. It is a real bummer because keeping them in this case would be a 5 star rating.",
