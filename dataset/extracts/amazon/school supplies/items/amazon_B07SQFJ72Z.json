It arrived quickly in a great flip-open box (that I will totally be re-purposing later), with everything my first grader needs for his first day of school. I didn't have to make a day out of running from one picked-over big name store to another picked-over big name store trying to compile enough supplies for him. It is going to be strange with the distance learning plans in place but knowing I have all that he needs in a single box allows me to worry about one less thing. Thanks y'all for helping a momma out!",
