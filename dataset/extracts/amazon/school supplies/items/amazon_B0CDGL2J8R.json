                "reviewText": "I actually chose these as additions to my new crafting studio as I was looking for a set of pens with a variety of inks & in a case I could easily \"grab & go\" with as I moved around my studio or traveled as I am constantly creating, sketching, designing things whether on an airplane, at a family reunion, or working in my tricked-out studio. My only disappointment with this set is a few of the pens were difficult to get the ink started (like maybe pens were fairly old) & one pen completely didn't work at all. Still, the set is worth the money in my opinion &, bonus -- my 5 year old project loving grandson decided he wanted to use the pens & is now practicing his writing in both English & Chinese (he's in the Chinese immersion program here) now that he has \"cool pencils\" to use to write with!",

Some were dark grey, dark pink, colors that could cross out whatever you are highlighting because they were so dark.All in all for $30 it was not worth it and I well be returning.I like the pencils though and already own some from this brand so I will just stick to liking their pencils.",
