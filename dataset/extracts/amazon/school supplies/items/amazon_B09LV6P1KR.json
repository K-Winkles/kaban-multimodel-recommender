These 3 were perfect. I needed something for washi tape on the go and these are perfect. They're not as sturdy as I would like (as they are pencil cases). And they seem a bit overpriced especially this time of year but I'm so pleased at how many rolls fit in each box (on their sides so you can easily see) that I might buy more and use with other craft items. I want to wait a little bit to make sure that the plastic latches on these don't break right away.",
