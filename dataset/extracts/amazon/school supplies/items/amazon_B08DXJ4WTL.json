It is a little frustrating that while hanging on a wall, it doesn\u2019t really lay flat so it\u2019s hard to view sometimes. Would be nice if there were more \u201cspecial day\u201d options. I imagine all this would be hard for a teacher wanting to use this for a classroom but for home it\u2019s totally manageable.",
