It is better for the environment to avoid plastic. These Oxford brand folders are excellent non-shiny finish, \u201cregular\u201d paper folders. They are sturdy, of a good size, have nice textured paper, and the variety of colors is nice. I bought them on sale in an Amazon \u201cdeal.\u201d Amazon has rather high prices on paper folders compared to stores, but this box of 25, in a deal, was comparable to the stores,\u2019 especially for the better quality Oxford brand folder. I\u2019m glad to get them delivered, too. Saves one more trip for school supplies during a busy time.",
