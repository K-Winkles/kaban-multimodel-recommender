                "reviewText": "While it's an inexpensive item per unit and has potential, it has taken me a while to wrap my head around how to use these best. My habit is to scour for boxes to organize household items, so I've been pondering what these might do. So far, I've used three: one for surplus charging cables, another for product manuals, and a third for household fasteners.The bags themselves are reasonably constructed. The zipper section is the weakest link; perhaps it is best to avoid storing items that require daily access. The mesh lattice on the sides obscures the visibility, but with ordinary room lighting, it's possible to see what's inside. They come in two sizes, 10 of each.Contrary to the assertion on the product page, they are not waterproof. While the lower plastic section repels moisture, the zipper area is porous, and in my test, the inside filled with water in seconds. While you won't rely on them when canoeing, there's still an extensive range of land-based applications for these, as other reviewers have pointed out.I'm slowly figuring out what they can do, but I'm pleased to have a new storage option. While I often use gallon-size Ziplock bags for kitchen food storage, these are much more versatile for household use. Soon, I will test them as a repository for household batteries, spare cleaning cloths, and computer parts. It doesn't hurt to have an extra storage option handy.",

I tried to tear one apart and could not with about 70% of my strength \u2013 I\u2019m not the strongest man but I am 240 lbs and over 6 feet and I\u2019m no elf. These bags are see-thru-ish \u2013 contents are semi-visible through the fabric. The mesh reinforced material and construction makes this bag water-resistant \u2013 but the zippers are not waterproof, so no dunking allowed. When I read mesh, I think screen door - but this material is solid and does not breathe - it is a mesh reinforced material.For a lost-cost bag, the zippers seem stronger than I would expect and also zip open and close smoothly. These bags are much bigger than I thought them to be. I easily fit magazines in the \u201csmaller\u201d of the two bags, and the larger bag could fit a pair of my pants (I\u2019m XXL - 40/32 pants) and could be used as a packing cube for traveling in a pinch.I think this is a 5-star product because I\u2019ve seen ones that cost more (and possibly less, so shop before buying) but even so, the unit price of each bag in this order is a good bit less than a dollar per unit ($0.85/ea) for a very useful organization product.",

I also use a few for blocks, kid\u2019s puzzles, and board games. The are space saving compared to boxes and still offer protection. They are sturdy with good zippers. So many kid items that I buy either don\u2019t fit back in the box after being taken out so these are a great solution for that. Use these for painting supplies, camping, travel, board games, blocks, puzzles, cleaning brushes/sponges, toys with little pieces, office supplies, ribbons, accessories, papers, homeschool materials, and s much more! The zippers all work smoothly and seem relatively well-made. You get so many large bags I this set making it a great value. One of my favorite things about these bags is that they are semi-see through so that you can see what is inside without opening them up or needing labels.",

To date, I\u2019ve been using ziploc type bags for storing all those annoying things we need or should keep; but have so much trouble keeping organized and where they will fit with ease.Enter these mesh zipper pouch bags: 10 large and 10 medium large, all with different color bands to stay even more organized while you are organizing. I will be able to load so much from the infamous family junk drawer as well as from all my ziploc bags:Portable chargers. USB lightning cords. USB C cords. Outdoor solar lighting charging accessories. Security charging accessories. Sharpie markers. Binder clips. Loose piles of post it notes. A pouch for mailing letters: stamps, address stamp, address labels, bill paying envelopes. Business cards for service workers.I think you get the point? \ud83e\udd2a\u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude09These are very useful for organizing what you THOUGHT you had organized. How naive we are lollll.",
