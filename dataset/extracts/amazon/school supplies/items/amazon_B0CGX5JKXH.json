                "reviewText": "These folders are well done and the colors are really nice. Things to know:* The folders do have have a translucence to them, so if an item is facing the cover others might be able to read/see information you would prefer to keep private.* I was able to fit about 35 sheets of 24 lb. copy paper on each side. Any more than that begins to block the binder holes.* The little tabs on the upper corner are only attached on the top, and will comfortably fit approximately 5-10 sheets of paper without being bent out of shape.* If you want to store a quantity of these in a binder, you might need to get an extra-wide binder unless you don't mind them sticking out a little.I really like these for printables that I may want quick access to, but don't want to punch holes in such as recipes, class notes, etc. They are a nice alternative to high-capacity sheet protectors.This review is for: EOOUT 24pcs Folders with Pockets 3 Hole Punched, 8 Retro Colors Fit in 3 Ring Binder, Letter Size Plastic Pocket Folder, Heavy Duty Folders with 4 Pockets for Office and School",
