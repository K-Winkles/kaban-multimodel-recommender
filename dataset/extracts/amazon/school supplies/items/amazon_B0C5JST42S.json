I used to use a single-compartment pencil pouch that I dumped all my writing utensils in, it was always just such a mess having to dig through it to find something. This helps with organization and it\u2019s so stylish! This corduroy fabric feels high-quality. There are plenty of different compartments inside and outside of the bag. However, I wish the middle pocket served as a divider, but it\u2019s designed with a gap underneath. Overall, still a great product!",

                "reviewText": "This bag is perfect for traveling with enough colored pencils to work on your current project. The pencil compartment will hold 20+ pencils securely since each loop will hold 2 pencils. I will use that compartment for the pencils I am currently using for a project. The other main compartment holds everything else you need such as erasers, blenders, paint pens, gel pens, extra pencils, a hand sharpener, etc.The quality of the bag is great and it is organized exactly as I needed. Love it!",
