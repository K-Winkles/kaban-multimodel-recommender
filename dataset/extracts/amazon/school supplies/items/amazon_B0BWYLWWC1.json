                "reviewText": "Got these little notebooks because I needed a dedicated notebook for a project. The look and feel are fantastic. Paper is good quality - not too thick but not \"paper\" thin either. The pocket is helpful if you have any loose papers to store. Overall, I'm quite happy with these. The only reason for one star off is because the cover can become quite scratched pretty easily. I'm not sure how to explain that better but it seems as if there were little marks on the covers before they were even out of their packaging. Not super obvious but apparent in the right lighting at the right angle. Not a deal breaker for me, as I'm very happy with them otherwise and would likely purchase again.",
