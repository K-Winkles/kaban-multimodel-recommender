I do recommend this product for all future scholars, who plan to do well in their classes. Ultimetely, a good student starts with good notes. THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!!!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for a small over-night toiletry bag. I can fit everything I need (toothbrush, paste, face lotion, washcloth, body lotion, body spray, brush, comb, hair clips, deodorant, contacts supplies, makeup) and that's without opening the over-flow! It fits nicely on small bathroom counter tops. Easy to access my stuff with the different zipper pockets. I'm sure it's great ss a pencil holder, but it's FANTASTIC as a toiletry bag. My mom even bought one after she saw mine! Recommend!",
