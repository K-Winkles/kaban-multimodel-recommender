                "reviewText": "The Bic Brite Liner is my go-to highlighter because it works well, is easy to hold, affordably priced, and the colors are really nice. The pen-style body with a pocket clip makes these highlighters very easy to put in a backpack or pocket, and also lets you easily store them in a pen cup. While Bic labels these highlighters as \"fluorescent\", it seems like only the yellow highlighter is the usual in-your-face fluorescent shade; but even then it's not bad. The other colors are more subdued compared to other fluorescent highlighters, but that's actually fine by me. Pink and blue are a bit pastel-like but still easy to read through. The orange shade is one of my favorites; it's a deeper orange than is typical for highlighters, but it's still very vibrant and easy to see through. Bic's green is dark and unfortunately doesn't work too well for actual highlighting, but you can use it for underlining; and ditto for the purple one. Overall, though, these are very good little highlighters, and they are another shining example of Bic providing a product that performs a lot better than the low price would suggest.",
