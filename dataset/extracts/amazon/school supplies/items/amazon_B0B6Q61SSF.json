                "reviewText": "I was so surprised by these mechanical pencils. Maybe they are a new generation? They almost look like a sturdy ball-point pen--nothing like the skinny pencils with the breakable lead--and hold so well in the hand. Great styling, durable lead, a wonderful mechanical pencil. And a terrific price.",
