                "reviewText": "I bought these pens because they are cheap and reliable. I know that I ordered 144, but I did not expect there to be so many pens. The pens are all packaged very nicely and surprisingly, they are not all in 1 big box, but rather in 4 packs of 36. This is great option if you need to have pens for multiple places such as your home, office, and anywhere else. A huge plus is that these all seem to be authentic. While the pens are not phenomenal, they are reliable and a great deal for the price!Pros- Great value- Conveniently in 4 separate packs- Reliable and recognizable brandCons- None",

                "reviewText": "The BIC Round Stic Xtra Life Ballpoint Ink Pens have proven to be a reliable choice for everyday writing tasks, earning a solid four-star rating in my book. These pens offer a balance of affordability, durability, and smooth writing performance that make them a staple in my stationery collection.First and foremost, the price point of these pens is hard to beat. For a budget-friendly option, the BIC Round Stic pens deliver remarkable value. The pack comes with multiple pens, making it an economical choice for students, professionals, and anyone who goes through pens frequently.In terms of durability, the \"Xtra Life\" feature lives up to its name. I've used these pens extensively for weeks without encountering any issues like leakage, dried-out ink, or premature breakage. The sturdy design ensures that they can withstand daily use, even when carried around in pockets or bags.One of the standout features of these ballpoint pens is the smooth and consistent writing experience they provide. The ink flows effortlessly, creating neat and clean lines on paper. Whether jotting down notes, writing essays, or making to-do lists, the BIC Round Stic pens deliver a pleasant writing experience that doesn't strain the hand even during prolonged use.The pens' clear plastic barrel is a nice touch as it allows me to see the ink level, ensuring I won't run out of ink unexpectedly. Additionally, the cap fits securely, preventing any accidental leakage when the pen is not in use.However, I must mention that the grip could be improved. While it's sufficient for short writing sessions, I noticed that during extended writing periods, the lack of a cushioned grip might lead to slight discomfort. Adding a soft grip feature could enhance the overall comfort and make these pens even more user-friendly.In conclusion, the BIC Round Stic Xtra Life Ballpoint Ink Pens are a dependable choice for everyday writing needs. Their affordability, durability, and smooth writing performance make them a practical option for various tasks. While a cushioned grip would elevate their comfort level, these pens remain a solid choice for those seeking a budget-friendly and reliable writing instrument. For everyday use, I would highly recommend the BIC Round Stic pens, and they have certainly earned their spot on my desk.",
