I'm able to fit a surprisingly large about of paper into it and a good number of pencils into the separate pencil holder. I really like the transparent enclosement in front, also separate from main storage area, that holds 10 or so papers that I can view without fear of messing them up. I've had it for a few months and have been pretty rough with tossing it around, piling things on it and dropping it often, but throughout it's held up remarkably well. I will probably but another one down the line and definitely would recommend.",
