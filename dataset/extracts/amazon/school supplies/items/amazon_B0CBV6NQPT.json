                "reviewText": "This correction tape is neat in its simplicity and the cover makes it easily portable without worrying about messing up the tape. However, the biggest downside for me is how you're unable to put tape over existing tape, instead it scratches it and makes everything messy. I ended up having to throw away my page of notes because of how messy it got.",

It's very easy to aim, not as messy as liquid whiteout, and the strips stay better adhered than normal tape versions. Plus, they are perfect for on the go, no exposed tape. The cap stays on well.I'm not sure what \"good luck\" means. I guess it's \"don't mess up?\"???! At any rate, these cover both pen ink (fountain pen) and typewriter ink. I'm really pleased and am switching to this brand.",
