I saw someone else say there's hardly anything on it and they feel they've been ripped off. That's why reading descriptions before you buy is very important. There is 9 feet of tape on each roll. That's how it's supposed to be - that's how it's advertised. Some rolls are wider than the others. I don't feel it's fair for someone to leave a bad review for getting exactly what was advertised. All washi tape is somewhat opaque until you tape it to something. It always looks more colorful when all rolled up. For the price, you can't beat it. It's beautiful, and there are so many designs and colors to choose from.",

I wiped the tubes down really well to make sure there was no lip balm residue on the outside that would prevent the tapes from sticking. Even so, they all peeled right off almost immediately. They are VERY pretty and were exactly the look I wanted, but since they didn't stick to the smooth plastic tubes, they wouldn't work for my purpose, so I had to buy something else to use instead (and the other tapes I ended up using stuck to the tubes just fine). Maybe they would work better for paper crafts or some other purpose though? I'll try to find a use for them somewhere...",

The photos also (probably because the tape looks so bright) make it seem like there would be some shimmery parts to the tape. There is no shine at all anywhere. The rolls are still pretty and I will still use them, but I did expect prettier tape.",
