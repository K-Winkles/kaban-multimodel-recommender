                "reviewText": "This pencil/pen case is much larger than the usual type pen/pencil case. I love that it holds all of my specialty type pens that I use in my planner and journaling. It also keeps them all together so I am not constantly scrambling for one type of pen versus another. The little zip down pouch holds my favorites right at my fingertips, as well as allows you to see inside of the case when using it. The bottom unzips for holding larger items like correction tape, adhesive tape, scissors, etc with additional space to put pens or pencils in. This is definitely perfect for the person who loves to journal or plan.",

                "reviewText": "My daughter needed some new school supplies as she headed off to college. This pencil pouch caught her eye because it is cute and colorful, and the functional storage sealed her decision. There are multiple pockets and slots for storing things, and various opening to access her supplies. The top zipper opening has a metal frame so that it is held open wide, or else folds closed like a hinge. She keeps her expensive graphing calculator in the flat bottom pocket, separate from everything else. In additional to her large calculator, this pouch can hold a lot more pens and additional supplies.",

                "reviewText": "When you have a niece who asked for a purple pencil holder, you don\u2019t delay in finding something for her. This was no exception, as we had not found anything that we liked in the local stores. When I saw how much room this had and the versatility with it I thought I should go ahead and order it. I was not disappointed. There are multiple compartments to hold a multitude of tools, pencils and pens. Very well-made and I suspect it will at least last most of the school year.",

                "reviewText": "The item was as described in the product page. It is a smaller bag but perfect for organizing a wide variety of stuff, sized to fit in a backpack.The finish on the case was very good, there weren't any snags or pulls in the fabric and there were no loose stiches or stitch ends anywhere inside or out. The upper pocket of the bag has bars of some sort stitched into each side, helping it to maintain its shape when closed and stay open when unzipped. The side zipper provides access to the larger upper pocket (which if not careful can be a source of spillage of contents out of the bag). The bottom pocket has straps that can secure a variety of things as well as a mesh pouch. There is a slight amount of padding sewn into the bottom portion of the bag, which will provide some, but not much, protection to items stored in this pocket.All of the zippers worked without issue. The only question mark is the small o-rings used to secure the zipper pull to the zipper mechanism. These seem kinda thin and cheap compared to the rest of the zipper and bag. We didn't have any issues during our test run, but long term this seems like the first point of failure for this bag. Luckily, these are easy to replace if they do break.With several neutral colors, I question the products marketing toward girls.All in all a good bag for school, art, and drawing materials.",
