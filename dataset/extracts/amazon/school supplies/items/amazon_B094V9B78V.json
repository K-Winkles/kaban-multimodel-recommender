Quality and price are probably unbeatable; but I do get frustrated by the size of the screen, which is still iphone size on my laptop. I ordered 3; one for me and two for gifts. I'm keeping mine, but returning the other two for fear they won't be used. If I could discover a way to enlarge the options screen on my laptop I'd give this 5 stars!",

It will only allow you to remember 10 labels, unless you buy a monthly/yearly subscription to access extra fonts and reprint any of the last 41 labels without redesigning them.If making new labels from scratch that need photo editing, it does turn off while standing by. Wish it would stay on a bit longer before turning off. It came charged enough to use right away and for quite a long time. Buy with confidence. Super easy to learn and utilize. Comes with everything needed, except for a charging brick. It has the usb to micro usb cable included. In box: D11 label maker, charging cable (no brick), quick start instruction manual, one roll of labels. I suggest getting an extra roll of the desired label size and the case.",
