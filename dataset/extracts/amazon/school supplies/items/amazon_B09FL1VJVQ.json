                "reviewText": "This pencil case is probably the BEST pencil case for artists and cartoonists; I will explain why. Firstly, then come in cute colors!! That means that you can choose the color that matches you! The color I got was the purple one, because I liked how cute it looked! Secondly, it is very roomy. Compared to my hand, it is a very large pencil case and it can hold a lot of stuff. For the artists, it is perfect because they may carry a lot of their art supplies. It can hold a variety of different items, including the very popular Tombow Dual Brush Pens (however, the popular pen cannot fit in the flap in the front of the case). Thirdly, it is organized, which is something I need. It has 5 slots on the front flap, a zipper pocket on the back, and two small pockets in the main component of the pencil case. All of which can be used for many things, like erasers, lead cases, flash drives, and more! Along with it being spacious, it is easy to carry and access. I love that I can open the flap and I have easy access to the main component! That way I do not have to open the big zipper to access the big component.It is, overall, a great pencil case for artists and cartoonists who want a spacious pencil case that holds a lot of pens, pencils, and other art supplies. 10/10 recommended!!(all art shown belongs to me)",

                "reviewText": "While it is advertised as a pencil case, I thought it would be perfect for carrying my essential makeup when traveling. I have now brought this with me several places, including 2.5 weeks in Europe. I specifically wanted a pouch with a wide opening (easy to reach for items) as well as a separate zip pocket for makeup brushes to lay when opened.I use mini makeup brushes on a daily basis, so full size brushes would not fit in the pocket (anything over ~5.25 inches long). The main compartment easily holds mascara, eyelash curler, eyeliners, concealer, face powder, etc. In the inner side pockets, I have bronzer and blush in one, and powder foundation compact and eyeshadow compact in the other.If you travel with a similar amount of makeup like me, it\u2019s perfect! Doesn\u2019t take up much space when zipped up in my personal item bag. When I\u2019m home, I still keep all my daily makeup in the bag and keep it in a drawer. Compact and convenient.",

I use these for my white out and adhesive. But what I like the most is the front. It unzips and you can place your top five fav pens. There\u2019s also a mesh so all of the other pens won\u2019t fall out when you unzip the front. Extremely durable fabric and zipper. I\u2019m going to get one in every color!!",
