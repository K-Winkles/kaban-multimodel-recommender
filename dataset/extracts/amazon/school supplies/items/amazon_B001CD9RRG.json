The thicker lead is more durable and it\u2019s still small enough to write well.Recently I\u2019ve had trouble finding the ones with the .9 lead. I was happy to find the pack for a really reasonable price.I 100% recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I was a little skeptical coming in because i didn't want to be that guy at work rocking a lime green and pink pencil, but i just decided to run with it. I'm glad i did. I write very hard (gorilla fingers) and i have snapped or broken the lead on basically all other pencils. I also lose pencils like no one's business. With these, they have the thickest, most durable lead i can get, and they are so cheap that i don't care if i lose them. This is the perfect pencil for work and school for fat fingered, dull witted apes like me.",
