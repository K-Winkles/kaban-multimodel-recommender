First of all, its so nice to have an alternate sharpened pencil that is not Ticonderoga. The pencils are high quality and there are plenty of them, so that's reassuring. We are able to sharpen them very nicely and the eraser is a really good one. None of the pencils we have used have broken. My daughter even feels comfortable lending a pencil to a fellow student or teacher because she has so many. I myself enjoy using the pencils. I highly recommend this product for the quality and excellent price and value.",

In other words, some will be great and easy to sharpen and others will have lead that breaks. The quality on some pencils isn\u2019t as great as in others in the same box but for the price, I would still get these and just expect some duds.These would be great to have on hand if you\u2019re a teacher or really anyone that works somewhere that has a high rate of disappearing pencils!

I've even started a recycling system to eliminate that terrible urge students have to sharpen their pencils right in the middle of my lessons. I have them deposit their full pencil and just grab an already sharpened one.These are quality pencils that sharpen up well and last quite a while. They erase clean and write smoothly.

                "reviewText": "I bought these as a teacher along with paper mate topper erasers for my students. The first day, the metal part with the eraser was wiggly and falling off the pencil as soon as I put the topper on. They came pre sharpened which I liked, but when I did sharpen them them many of them were dudds. I will use the rest of the box but will not purchase again.",
