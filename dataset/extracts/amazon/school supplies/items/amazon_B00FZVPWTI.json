                "reviewText": "I was looking for a way to organize supplies in my Sunday school file cabinet - scissors, glue sticks, stickers, tracts, wordless books, etc. Everything was just in a loose, cluttered mess and I could never find what I needed in a hurry. When I saw these cases on Amazon, I thought they might work, so I ordered a set of 10 medium ones to try. Using just 6 or 7 has opened up so much room in that drawer - and now everything is in its own little case that I can pull out and transport from our resource room to my classroom and back again without pieces falling out everywhere! What a blessing! They stack neatly - either on top of each other, or side by side. The clips on the edge are really secure - the case won't open on its own unless you fill it too full. I used the other cases at home - one holds my small supply of cosmetics, another holds extra charging cords and small electronic device supplies, and another holds stationary supplies like post it notes, a small stack of envelopes and thank you note cards. They work for so many items, I keep thinking I should order another set. If you have craft supplies or office supplies you need organized, or your kids have toys with small pieces/parts that need to stay contained when not in use, I highly recommend these cases. Once you start organizing with them, you'll be looking for other ways to use them - I guarantee it!",

Great quality and good size!Amazon \u201cUsed Like New\u201d Review:I noticed that Amazon offered several \u201cUsed Like New\u201d options for these containers that were cheaper. They were all fulfilled and sold by Amazon and various descriptions along the lines of \u201cmay not come in original packaging\u201d. I decided to go ahead and order one of these sets. The box came with a sticker on the outside saying \u201cThanks to you, this product has a second life.\u201d The cases were not damaged and in perfect condition, just without any packaging. I\u2019m pleased with this option and wanted to share my experience in case anyone else is also looking into this purchase option as well.",

                "reviewText": "These are decent storage container. They won't see heavy use as they are mostly for storing small items and they are quite adequate for that. I can't judge durability for the long run, but they are sturdy enough that they should hold up. Given that the hinges are molded from the container itself, that would be the first thing to fail. That said, I would imagine that other containers share the same design. They are only small hinges on each side and would have been much stronger if the hinge were the entire width of the container.I would recommend that you take a close look at the measurements. I ordered the medium size and, although I did check the measurements, it is on the small side. I would call it small rather than medium. It's fine for a pencil box or for small items like USB flash drives, AA or AAA batteries, maybe spools of thread or jewelry storage. I will be buying some larger containers because, being small, I have filled them quickly and have three of them on my desk where I would have preferred one somewhat larger container. YMMV",
