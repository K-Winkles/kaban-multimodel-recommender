I was mainly loving the colors and the price wasn't too bad either. They work well and the colors show up. They don't tear the pages or anything, but I did notice that when you press down it can sometimes leave a little chunk of the wax. When this happens and the two pages line up that have the highlighted wax on it, they tend to stick together. I would still recommend these though. I plan to pick a color for each type of verse so it can be color coded instead of just picking a pretty color when I want to highlight something.",
