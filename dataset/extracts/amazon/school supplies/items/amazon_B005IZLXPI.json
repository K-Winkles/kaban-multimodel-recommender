In 1783, the ironworks was taken over by the Bjorkman family and production focused on processing copper ore from the nearby Orijarvi copper mine. By the nineteenth century there was little copper left to be mined in Orijarvi, so the blast furnace was closed in 1802.

                "reviewText": "Oh, the wonders of the Fiskars 01-005358 Back to School Supplies Wood Ruler, 12 Inch! Let me regale you with the epic journey this seemingly humble measuring device took me on.From the moment I laid eyes on this wooden wonder, I knew I was in for a wild ride. The sleek, polished surface beckoned me, promising precise measurements and mathematical glory. Little did I know, it had much more in store for me.As I gripped the ruler firmly in my hand, I could feel its power coursing through my fingertips. It was as if I held a tool that could shape the very fabric of the universe (or at least my geometry homework). With a flick of the wrist, I set off on my adventure.The ruler effortlessly glided across the page, leaving behind a trail of perfectly straight lines. It had a way of making me feel like a master artist, meticulously sketching diagrams with unparalleled precision. I was the Michelangelo of geometry, armed with the mighty Fiskars ruler.But the true magic of this ruler unfolded when I least expected it. One fateful day, as I was measuring the length of a pencil, the ruler whispered to me. Yes, you read that right\u2014this ruler spoke! Okay, maybe it didn't speak in the literal sense, but it whispered encouragement, filling me with newfound confidence.\"Measure fearlessly,\" it seemed to say. \"With me in your hand, no measurement is too daunting.\" And so I did. I measured everything in sight: the length of my cat's tail (12 inches, just like the ruler), the width of my bedroom door (twice the ruler's length), and even the circumference of a pizza slice (don't ask). Each measurement was a triumph, an affirmation of my ruler-wielding prowess.But alas, every adventure must come to an end. After many months of conquering the measurement realm, my trusted Fiskars 01-005358 Wood Ruler started to show signs of wear. Its edges softened, and a few battle scars appeared. It had fought countless battles on my behalf, after all.So here I stand, at the end of this remarkable journey, bidding farewell to my faithful measuring companion. The memories we shared, the lines we drew, and the secrets it whispered will forever be etched in my mind.In conclusion, the Fiskars 01-005358 Back to School Supplies Wood Ruler, 12 Inch, is not just a measuring tool. It's a vessel of inspiration, a companion on a quest for accuracy, and a whisperer of encouragement. Whether you're a student, an artist, or an aspiring mathematician, this ruler will take you on an epic adventure\u2014one measurement at a time. Embrace its power, and let it guide you to greatness.Rating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 (5 out of 5 stars)",
