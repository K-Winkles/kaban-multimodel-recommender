It was my first time trying them so I wasn\u2019t sure if I would like them or not. My only regret is not ordering multiple boxes. The colors are great, vibrant enough to see but still light enough to easily read what you\u2019ve highlighted. They don\u2019t bleed-through too much (so far it\u2019s mainly just purple for me & only at the beginning & end), easy & comfortable to hold + they last a while. Definitely a good value, especially if you AREN\u2019T using them on super thin bible pages",

Usually purple highlighters are too dark and yellow highlighters are a bit obnoxious to look at, these are eye catching and soft which I appreciate. Bic quality is also up to par. One of the highlighters came with a rip in the grip but there\u2019s 12 in the pack and the rest were perfectly fine.",

They are amazing especially for the price point. I definitely recommend getting the big box like I did however, because they seem to grow legs and walk away! I really like that they wont dry up either. I've used many highlighters and I think these are my favorite simply because of how basic they are and how nicely they stick out on paper.",
