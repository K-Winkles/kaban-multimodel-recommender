                "reviewText": "Was looking for a cheap and easy setup for a secondary PC that children would be using for general web browsing, homework, and occasional gaming. This combo fit the bill and then some. The feel of the keyboard is smooth and responsive with functional feedback and resistance in the keys. The only downside is the audible noise you get from keystrokes.The Mouse is pleasantly smooth with good button engagement and response. The DPI switch is a very nice addition and performs flawlessly when needed.The winning tick for this combo is the RGB quality at this price point. The keyboard provides an impressive array of colors that are not overly bright or distracting, but not so muted that they regress out of sight. The Mouse has a nice fading array of simplistic lines that adds to the ambiance of the lighting package.Overall, I think it's a great package for light general use. The RGB features really add to the value and provide an impressive overall package for the price.",

                "reviewText": "Great and solid keyboard, fun times. Logitech and Razer must recognize the NPET! This keyboard is thin, not bulky, and has a solid METAL baseplate. It feels sturdy and heavy, doesn't slide around on my desktop. There are dual springs on the space bar and the keyboard includes a red key puller tool. The keystrokes are deep, precise and quiet. My typing/keystroke accuracy is much improved on this keyboard. No drivers were needed, and you can adjust the colors and effects just how you like them using the Function key on the keyboard. There is a Windows key lockout. The keyboard backlight turns off after a few idle minutes, and I am not sure if the time-out can be adjusted. The media keys work. Very solid keyboard for the price.",

                "reviewText": "NPET K10 Backlit Gaming Keyboard, Black, Purchased 10/22, Reviewed 10/22/2022I purchased the K10 budget membrane faux mechanical keyboard. I was searching for a backup budget keyboard because my main PC keyboard gave up the ghost after 7 years. I needed a backup so I could continue working from home, while I waited for the new replacement keyboard to arrive next week.1st impression: when I grabbed the Amazon package at my front door, I thought, \"Wow, this is a heavy keyboard.\" Opening the package, I was impressed with its mechanical keyboard look, and it looked like a quality keyboard but at a budget price of $20. Of course, as soon as I set the K10 on the desk, I started testing the keypress feedback, noise, and how typing felt. Key travel felt a tiny bit stiff but still good for this price point. Any keying noise was surprisingly low.Plugging in the K10's braided USB cable, the first con is revealed: the cable is too short at 67\" long, another 6 to 12 inches would be better. The board's RGB lights lit up, and my Windows 10 Pro PC had no issues with the new K10. The next thing I noticed, which is not necessarily a negative, is that the keys are smaller than typical full-sized keyboard keys. [Update \"edit\" 4/12/23: I later compared my full size keyboard and the new replacement keyboard I had ordered, and the keypad surface area is the same. (What was different was the K10's top surface has a slightly deeper concave indentation, so the feel is slightly different.)] I am a touch typist capable of 60+wpm so the size of the keypad felt a little off; however, with use, it would feel fine. With nearly 40 years of using and owning many computers and their keyboards, touch typing resulted in some initial missed direct keypad hits, but adjusting was easy. One additional observation: right after startup, a distinct odor was coming from the board, sort of an electrical and plastic overheating smell (note, I had the RGB lights off). After about 20 minutes, it faded, and I haven't noticed it since. [edit 4/12/23 I have been using nearly 5 months most days on my Hosting Music pc and no issues at all.]What does a touch typist think of the key typing on the K10?\u2022 Sore fingers. My fingers were tired after 1 hour, and after 2 hours, they were sore. The problem is how I type, pushing down slightly harder than the average typist, who maybe learned to type on a mushy membrane keyboard. I learned on IBM Selectrics, which required a slightly heavier key press. The keystroke travel is higher or longer on the floating keys of the K10 than on most keyboards at 3.6mm, so I have to push further down for it to bottom out the key travel, and if I am typing hard and fast, my fingers are sore. I tested where the action point in the key travel seemed to be; it's either halfway or slightly higher. So if I type with a lighter keystroke and try to avoid the key bottoming out, there should be less soreness. A lighter touch is possible, and the keys feel good as you type along and shouldn't cause sore fingers. I would like the stroke to be a little softer or less stiff. [edit 4/12/23 After some practice, I haven't had any soreness issues.]\u2022 \"Noise,\" a comment about YouTube reviewers Any YT review doing their keyboard review on a wooden desk or a hard desk surface with no large mouse pad that cushions and accommodates both the keyboard and mouse is only testing the keyboard's resonance with the hard desk, and that is likely 2x or 3x louder than typing with a keyboard on a desk size keyboard - mouse pad. Typing noise on the K10 sitting on a 32\" x 12\" x 2-3mm thick pad was very low.\u2022No movement, the K10 on my full-size keyboard/mouse pad does not slide or move at all. The K10's weight and three rubber grip pads on the front bottom of the chassis, plus the two pull-out feet, securely hold the board with no movement.\u2022 Key wobble was not noticeable, very slight on the space bar.\u2022 RGB lights, are not my thing, but if there was an RGB selection that lit only the key letters and numbers, that would be ideal. However, it's not an option.I have about 27 days to decide if I should keep the K10 or return it to Amazon. I'm pretty sure it's a keeper.[Update: 4/12/23, I kept the K10 and use it almost daily. For the price and for my type of usage, I would recommend the K10. Would it be a good gaming keyboard? I do play games, I tried it for one game, and it was fine, I have never owned an expensive gaming board or typed on one, so I cannot compare. ]",

                "reviewText": "I always just used my K120 Logitech Keyboard, its 10 bucks, I can use up to like 5 keys at once and never had trouble with how many keys Im allowed, its quiet when typing, the keys are easy to press and find, and it did the job well.However, after 5 years of use, it broke. (Finally, I know right?) and I decided to spend a whole 7 dollars more on a keyboard.Then I bought this, its terrible, the buttons are clickey, the cord is flimsey, the lights are so shiny it hurts my eyes.Just kidding.The buttons are amazing, what become easy to click, became easier, everything feels so smooth, the keys are fairly quiet but its probably just because I am a light typer. The lights allow me to turn my lights off and not have to guess where my keys are when I type. I found my WPM went up by 10 words per minute, originally it was 60, now its 70. Much easier to type because of the smooth and easy transition for my fingers and how open, easy, and strong the buttons are. Each button feels distinct and easy to find for my muscle memory.The buttons are tough as nails, I can easily tell this keyboard will last a while, its easy to clean under them due to how the keyboard was made, literally can just blow the gunk off with a can of ultra duster.As for the gaming part, every single key I press reacts, I can press as many damned keys as I want and they all work perfectly. The best part is how the F1 - F4 is set up, each F keys are lined in 4, this means in games that require me to use F1 - F4 are much easier to play because of how the intelligent designers set this up. For instance, in SC2 I need to press the F keys to set up my camera hotkey so its easier to move from location to location, I am CONSTANTLY pressing these keys as Zerg and before I always tended to hit ESC or F5 but because of how these keys are set up, I never make those mistakes again. And due to the distinction of the F keys, I never accidently hit the wrong F key anymore either. Dramatically improving my capability to play.Whats more, sometimes even with my K120, I have to press more than 5 keys and that 6th key wont go through. This means if I have to run and turn, which is A, D, Shift, and then jump, space, and then press Capslock to talk, and then ult which is `, my ult wont go off because thats 6 keys. In Overwatch this is incredibly common. You need to constantly run, jump, talk, and sometimes ult at the same time. Many times I make this mistake, I will wind up dying or causing someone else to die. However, no longer does this happen with this keyboard!The LED keys are great, not too bright. I wish I could have a only blue option but I dont mind.I only have one negative thing to say: The space sucks balls, its loud, and... well its just loud. I am a very quiet typer because of how my fingers have to move quickly accross the keyboard and every time I have to press space I cringe a little. I found out why its like this, the springs arent tightened, whoever made this keyboard made the springs on it very loose however thats also another great thing about this keyboard: You can fix it because you can see the springs, which means with a knife or tweezers, you can easily push the springs apart a bit to tighten up the spacebar. I just havent gotten around to it.This keyboard is a work of art, for the price, I'd say its 100 percent worth it. I'd say this is worth 60 bucks in my opinion but I'll go with 19, I aint complainin.",
