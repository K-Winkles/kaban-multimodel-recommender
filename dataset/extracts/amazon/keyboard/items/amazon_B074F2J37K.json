The solid clicking sound of the keys lets you know that the key was depressed as expected. The backlight is supposed to be dimmable, but I haven't figured that out yet. A great all-around bargain that I am very pleased with. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Good value for the money, but improvement needed",
                "reviewText": "The first unit I received had an issue with the delete key, where it would get stuck in the \"down\" position and it would take me several seconds to manually get it loose. This was nothing short of catastrophic on several occasions in a work environment. Cleaning under the keycap didn't fix the issue, but the replacement unit they sent me worked perfectly (from a mechanical standpoint).To briefly summarize, I offer the following:Pros:--Backlight brightness is excellent for the primary key functions--Decent amount of travel and \"clickiness\"--Stable connectivity issues even when connected with a 4-in 2-out USB switching hub--Keycaps are easily removable for cleaningCons (see photo):--No activation light on the CapsLock key. (-0.5 stars)--Secondary key functions (i.e.; the FN functions, like volume control, play, pause, stop, etc on the F1-F12 keys, and arrows on W/A/S/D) are NOT backlit. They are, in fact, very difficult to see under normal lighting conditions, let alone low light. (-0.5 stars)--This might sound a little petty, especially considering it's pictured in the listing, but the font verges on cringeworthy. (Because this is an issue of personal taste, not overall function, I won't penalize the final star rating for this).--Again, an issue of personal taste, but the plastic feels somewhat cheap to me, even though there hasn't been any structural issues with it thus far. Because I'm a ThinkPad guy, and I know I'm spoiled when it comes to keyboards, I'm not penalizing the star rating for this.At around $30, it's the best value in its class. However, the backlight issue and lack of an indicator light for CapsLock are severe drawbacks, even taking price into consideration. For that reason, I have given it 4 Stars overall.If you can live with those issues, or only have $30 to spend, this is probably the keyboard for you. If not, you'd probably be better served by a more expensive alternative.",

Compared to other TKL's I've found, this is exceedingly nice to type on. The backligting, while blue only, can easily be turned off and has multiple levels. The inclusion of volume and media functions on the fn row is nice, but even better there's a windows lock key. Strangely, the arrow keys have WASD printed (but not illuminted) on them, and the WASD keys have the arrow keys on them, with the arrows not illuminted. Further, there's a windows key lock fn. Clearly this board targets gamers. I have yet to look and see if the arrow key oddity is because it's possible to get them to act as a WASD cluster.The font is pretty 'Gamer-y' as well, but clearly readable.Coming from someone who uses a custom built split mechanical keyboard (ergodone) every day, this keyboard is very nice. Clearly be aware it is ten-key less, if that's relevant to you. But, if you need the desk space or just want a smaller board, this board is great.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this keyboard. There are a couple chips on the key caps, but they're on the bottom so completely unnoticeable. Hopefully this keyboard gives me a couple good years of use. The blue key switches, are very very close to Cherry MX Blues. They're slightly more stiff, and more loud, but that's just what I wanted to be honest. I use MX Browns at work, so using these clone blues give me a very satisfying experience when I'm working from home. These keys can be used for gaming, but I do not recommend blue key caps for gaming, this same company actually makes brown switch keyboards for slightly more. They may be very good for gaming, just warning they may be too loud for others to hear you. They are delightful for typing however. My type speed is down from a membrane keyboard, but that's probably because the key travel is more. But it is very delightful to type on. I can't believe they can deliver such a close replica(maybe even better) of MX Blues for so cheap.",

                "reviewText": "For only $28 this is a phenomenal keyboard. This keyboard uses cherry mx blue equivalents (they look like Outemu Blues) and are really loud just like you should expect. The clickiness is there but the only huge problem is the insane amount of ping coming from the keyboard. It sounds as if you're hitting a really hollow metal cylinder with another piece of metal. The keys are nice, but they're also kind of ugly. The lights are nice, but I wish they had more than only 8 options. The build quality is very nice, there is no flex from the keyboard because the top plate is made of metal. It has good weight to it and is nice to use. The rubber feet on the keyboard is also really nice. overall this keyboard would be absolutely perfect if there was way less ping.",

La retroalimentacion al pulsar cada tecla es muy satisfatoria seguida del audible clic de las teclas mecanicas cherry blue. La luces solo vienen en un color, azul, pero es mas que suficiente para ver el teclado en un cuarto oscuro. El producto tuvo un retrazo en la audana ya que estos teclados se fabrican en los estados unidos, aun asi llego mucho antes del tiempo de retraso previsto. De ahora en adelante todos mis teclados seran EagleTec.",
