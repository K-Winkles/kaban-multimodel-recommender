                "reviewText": "Pros-easy plug and play, plugged the USB receiver to the computer and KB and mouse started working immediately.-light weight, aesthetically nice looking KB and Mouse comboThings to note:Key board - this is a semi-compact KB. It is not a full-size KB, but it does have num pad, and delete/home/end buttons. Appearance is nice. Illumination is good, you can adjust the colors and brightness (of KB only, mouse has a rotating RGB setting).Mouse - very light weight and easy to use, however it is a standard 3 button mouse, I previously had a 6 button (back and forward keys) and really miss those keys at times.Cons- No FN lock key, you have to 2-hand FN functions. This is a bit of a frustration for the end user and major oversight by the manufacturer.- KB is not angle adjustable, it comes at a slight angle which is fine, but being able to adjust the angle makes for better ergonomics and again a major oversight on this product.- would have like \"backspace\" key to be a little bigger (double key).- like most products in this price range, materials are cheap lightweight plastic.Overall - although there are some associated cons with this product I am happy with the product and will continue to use it. However, I recognize that these CONS are not insignificant and can be a deal breaker for some, it almost was for me.",

I love the universal design of the mouse, as a left hander I am finding more and more mice are solely designed for right handed people, so a simple mouse with no weird shape or side buttons is excellent for me. The only minor issue I have, and it really is minor, is where the delete, home, page up, page down and end keys are, I have never had a keyboard with them anywhere other than above the numeric keypad so I am still finding myself accidently hitting them instead of the backspace, enter and shift keys, but I think it is more of a me issue, it is definitely shown like that in the picture and it wouldn't have stopped me from buying it if I had noticed. Great set and an affordable price.",

I chose a set with a plain black keyboard and a mouse. The Keyboard is smaller than I imagine. The key cap is matte, and there is almost no sound when you hit the keys, which is better for me so I will not bother my colleagues. By the way, the keys on this keyboard are arranged compactly because of its relatively small size. It takes a little time to get familiar with it but I think I will get used to that eventually. Inputting is smooth just like the normal wired keyboard and mouse. Nothing to complain about. Also, the keyboard is more convenient to charge with a USB cable than with a removable battery. Overall, it is a good deal for this price. I will recommend you this product if you are a similar budget.",
