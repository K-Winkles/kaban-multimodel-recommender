                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic keyboard",
                "reviewText": "This keyboard IMO is the best of the best. Yea, it is a bit more expensive than other out there, but you are getting more. You get an option of many different Cherry MX keys(I went with Blue), a USB pass through, GREAT RGB lighting, added macro keys and a VERY comfortable wrist rest.I have tried the Razer Blackwidow V3 and the Elite. Both are good keyboards, but the Elite, while it had a nice wrist rest(magnetic) had black key bases so it's RGB lighting is dim and the V3, which does have good RGB lighting, didn't have the USB pass through and came with a hard plastic wrist rest that doesn't attach , in any way, to the keyboard(no magnets or anything, it just sits there). The green Razer keey were pretty good but no match for the feel and sound of true Cherry MX Blue keys.Another thing I love about the K95 is the ability to load lighting profiles directly to the keyboard so you do NOT need to be running iCue to get the lighting effects you want. This is a nice thing to have when you want to run a minimized set up for gaming or move the keyboard to another computer. Razer has none of this.On top of this, the light really blows Razer out of the water. With the exception of the Blackwidow V3, all Razer RGB keyboards seem dim and under lit compared to Corsair. The translucent key bases make all the difference. Plus this has an added RGB light bar at the top of the keyboard for an extra add effect, which looks awesome. And the Corsair log is at the top of the keyboard, so it does NOT get hidden by the write rest, unlike Razer's keyboards, which have the log at the bottom.The one (big) minus I will give Corsair is iCue. It is a big step behind Razer in programmability. It seems to take a lot more steps to accomplish what is easily done in Razer's Synapse. Plus, if you have multiple Razer devices, it allows you to group the devices so when you set a lighting profile, it applies to ALL devices. In iCue, you have to set the lighting profile for EACH device independently, which is a complete waste of time. To add to this, while Corsair has profiles that you can load to the keyboard directly, you have to program them in it's own HARDWARE tab and you CANNOT copy regular lighting profiles to the Hardware tab. So you basically have to program the light profile TWICE. Another waste of time.ProsSolid constructionchoice of different Cherry MX keysUSB pass throughGREAT and BRIGHT RGB lighting, with added light bar and logo at top, which won't get blocked by wrist restMacro keysNicely padded wrist restConsiCue - Corsair really needs to step it up and look at how Razer does Synapse as there are many head scratching things in iCue.All in all this is a great keyboard. If you are after great RBG lighting and added macro keys, get this. Just be prepared for some extra effort needed for iCue.",

                "reviewText": "I'm very picky about my equipment. This is my first mechanical keyboard and I had 3 requirements. Needed Macro keys, media controls and a palm rest. The RGB lighting is has 3 modes from comfortable dim to super bright with 5 different color pattern profiles built into the keyboard. I got the mx silver switches. I especially like the silvers because they are low profile actuation and take very little pressure to trigger. Also, they don't make a click sound like the blue switches do. I hate audible feedback. I also really appreciate the volume slider instead of a button on the media controls. Lastly this keyboard is heavy! It's literally mostly aluminum and it is very sturdy and solid with no flex in the board at all. This is the best keyboard I've ever bought and it's worth every penny. Thanks Corsair! 10/10",

                "reviewText": "Guys, stop reading this and just buy it, best advice I can give you.I have had two of these now, I bought a K95 Platinum with Speed Switches and a K95 Platinum XT with Blue Switches, both by Cherry MX.First off, Cherry MX switches are the business. They sound the best, look the best, feel the best because they are the best, hands down.Second off, the materials that this keyboard is made of had to of come from the most premium of parts vendors because even the keycaps feel like a luxury. My Mercedes Benz's parts have a feel that resembles the feel I get when typing on this keyboard, so I can only describe it as a luxury.The LEDs... WOW. They are extremely bright and allow multiple different brightness settings. You can change the color of absolutely every LED on this keyboard and the light bar across the top is comprised of 12 different lights that can be addressed individually. The lighting effects that you can make with this keyboard are endless and the community has tons of designs available for download if you cannot make it yourself. iQUE's software allows for just about anything you can imagine to be done to this keyboard's LED lights.The typing and gaming experience is just simply a pleasure. Typing this review right now feels like an absolute delight and the sound it is making is nothing short of pure bliss. Oh, and did I mention it has media controls too? Cause uh yeah, it does, and man is that a feature all keyboards should have. For gaming, you have six macro keys that come in handy and are easy to reach. The texturized keycaps make sure your fingers are not going to accidentally slide onto Q when you don't want to ultimate in Overwatch. They also include a keycap with the Corsair boat on it, which is pretty awesome, and I used it to replace my, \"Esc,\" key.Everything is addressable and wildly customizable. The wrist rest is plush and feels absolutely amazing, seriously, one of the best placements for a wrist rest I have ever experienced.I strongly recommend the K95 Platinum XT over the Standard Platinum as it offers the integration with your stream deck and it also offers the Cherry MX Blue switches. Which I strongly recommend as they are pretty quiet for being MX Blues. If not, I would recommend the Cherry MX Reds or Browns for typing and gaming use. If you don't plan on doing much typing and a lot of gaming, go with the Cherry MX Speeds.Buy this keyboard guys, it is worth it, you keep keyboards for years anyway. Go ahead and treat yourself, you won't regret it.",

                "reviewText": "It is heavy and sturdy. I was able to configure 11 lightning effects in iCue so the keys come with different colors and the ESC blinks. My kids cannot wait to buy some cute key caps!Yet I want some constraints though.The keyboard takes two, instead of one, USB ports - one for the keyboard, one for the USB pass through and is USB 2.0 only. I was a little disappointed because my legacy Apple A1243 keyboard (back to year 2008!) needs only one USB port, but comes with 2 USB ports on left and right.The Cherry MX Blue switches are amazing. It was actually my kid\u2019s\u2019 preference to louder clicks and clacks. I personally like brown. That been said, Blue still works for me. But the feeling when the key reaches bottom is really too loud and hurt. I am going to buy some o-ring under the key caps. Small problem.Generally, this USB keyboard is NOT recognized before the OS boots up. It mean you cannot hit the key to enter BIOS interface. You have to manually turn on/off BIOS mode so that you can use the keyboard to get into and change BIOS settings. The method is cumbersome: you have to unplug USB cable, then press and hold B and S same time, plug in the USB and keep hold B and S for 5 seconds until the three top right LEDs,(NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock) all turn on, then you can release B and S. Now you can enter and manage BIOS using keyboard. At BIOS mode, all the fancy effects and actions defined in iCUE won\u2019t work., it is just a plain ordinary keyboard. If you want to quit BIOS mode, you have to unplug again, hold the ESC then plug in USB cable, keep holding ESC for 5seconds until the3 LEDs (NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock) turns off. Once you leave BIOS mode, the lighting effects and actions will come back. If you need to tweak BIOS settings, it\u2019s suggested that you have a legacy keyboard on hand.Although you can define complex multiple lighting effects (e.g. blue for a-z, red for 1-0, green for others, rainbow wave for background, etc) in iCue. If iCue isn\u2019t running, or if you are at locking screen, only one lighting effect is permitted.In general, this keyboard is impressive and robust. Pity I cannot find an ideal Corsair keyboard with wireless + RGB backlit + Cherry Blue switches. This wired edition is my final compromise.",
