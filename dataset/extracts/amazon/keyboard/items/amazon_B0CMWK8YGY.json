I\u2019ve done tape mods, stabilizer mods, experimented with a variety of switches and keycap profiles, put car sound deadening foam in the cases, etc.This thing sounds better stock (more clacky than thocky) out of the box than anything else I own. I can actually leave this keeb alone and not feel like I need to upgrade anything at all.It also has features like south facing RGBs and polycarbonate plate and sound insulation, features usually on present in keebs costing 3x as much. The switches - smooth and superb. Keycaps are great thickness and quality.Do yourself a favor and just buy it. You will be so pleasantly surprised. I bought it as a \u201cbudget mod platform\u201d to gift to a friend - ended up switching out the keycaps just for color profile purposes and buying a second one for myself.",

                "reviewText": "This cordless keyboard has three connection methods: Bluetooth (with up to three paired devices), 2.4GHz with USB dongle, and USB C (which also charges the keyboard.The keys are not shine-through, so while it\u2019s backlit, don\u2019t expect to be able to see the lettering on the keys in the dark. The lights are directly under the keycaps, though, so you can purchase a set of replacement keys if that\u2019s desired. The keys do appear to be double-shot molded, so the lettering won\u2019t wear down over long use, which is a really nice feature that often goes unnoticed.Out of the box it\u2019s charged past 75%, and the time is within 5 minutes of the correct time, given the time zone is somewhere in Asia. It comes set to windows mode, and the knob controls the volume.The Bluetooth can pair up to three devices, press Fn+Q, or W, or E to switch between the three, and press and hold to go into pairing mode for each. Pairing was easy and straightforward.The settings menu can be entered by pressing Fn and the volume knob (which can be pressed like a button). The settings menu is in Chinese, but scrolling to the language menu is easy and obvious - it has both a Chinese character and \u201cen\u201d in the menu icon.The keys are fairly tactile, and the click is muted and soft, but this is not a quiet keyboard. The overall construction is good, the case feels stiff and doesn\u2019t flex under use, and it hard to flex on purpose when twisting it by hand.It has two heights with the kick kickstands. They seem fairly secure, though I worry they could come off and be lost like every other keyboard.The USB dongle is held in with a magnet, which concerned me as it might also get lost, but hitting the keyboard into my hand wasn\u2019t enough to dislodge it, so it may stick around for awhile. The dongle is labeled AJAZZ so it should be easy to put back with the keyboard later if misplaced and found again.Typing with it works well, and in Bluetooth with my fast typing speed it didn\u2019t miss a single letter - definitely a good keyboard as I\u2019ve reviewed several wireless keyboards that just didn\u2019t work consistently under my usage.Lastly, I\u2019m glad it has real arrow keys in the normal arrangement. This makes so many keyboards useless for me. The placement of the delete key isn\u2019t great, but since this is a small keyboard it\u2019s an ok trade off.Overall I\u2019m excited to have this keyboard, and will see how it works as my daily keyboard going forward.",

I love how I can connect it 3 different ways to suit my location situation... 2.4g mode, Bluetooth, and usb wired ( lead supplied)The keys are nice and cluncky and spaced perfectly for my finger spread. I like the funky colour lights effect, my favourite is everything else it does though. I can change the keys around ( tool supplied) and I like the plastic keyboard cover it comes with to protect it from dust. I miss that on the new keyboards that don't come with one. I also like that it has a volume control, brightness control, pause, playback, next track, email, calculator and loads more. This is amazing for me, I've not used one like this before and I'm so impressedI'm playing with this keyboard as I'm writing this review because I keep finding different functions and I want to mention them hereIt's not a light weight one there is some weight in it and it's not a keyboard I would use for traveling because of the weight but for taking to the office and back wouldn't be a problem although this one is staying permenantly at home solely for my use and away from envious eyes or it will probably develop legs and disappear if I take it to work. I actually got this for my mini pc but I'm going to use it as my main keyboard for all devices because it makes the other keyboards seem lacking in too many ways.If you want the full operations for the keyboard you need to download the driver from the AJAZZ website. The details are in the box it comes in.You can connect to windows and Mac although I'm on windows I haven't tried it on Mac.The instructions are in the box but I suggest having a full play with it. It's quite an enlightening experience for a novice like me. I'll probably be here for the rest of the afternoon playing with this - it's my new 'go to' toy",

There are no issues with delays, whether it's USB, Bluetooth or WiFi connected, and the clacking of the keys is satisfying and responsive.
