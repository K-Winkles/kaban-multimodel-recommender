                "reviewText": "I have had this keyboard for over a month now. I previously owned the Logitech K800 (had several over the years and loved them) and then went to a Logitech MK. With the MK I wanted to like it but it was hard to get used to the keys but more importantly after three month I had to have it plugged in after a few hours as the charge was horrible. I miss the backlighting but I just love this keyboard. The keys are a little noisy but after a while I don't even notice it. One of my main things was that I wanted a built in palm rest as I rarely use it on a table, usually I have it on my lap. I cannot say enough about this keyboard it far exceeded my expectations. Another feature that is wonderful is that you don't have an on and off switch. I goes into sleep if you are not typing for a bit and there is no delay once you start typing. It is very simple and extremely light but it works just perfectly for me. I do admit I have a Logitech mouse that I prefer so I need two usbs. The one that came with this keyboard is okay but the size is a bit small for my hand. For the price especially you cannot go wrong with this keyboard!",

                "reviewText": "OK - I love this keyboard's feel and action. The mouse is super comfortable. It's a super great keyboard and mouse combo.Just two things keep me from being able to keep it. 1 - The letters printed on the keys are in the upper left corner of each key, they aren't centered on the key. I'm a serious hunt and peck typist and I found myself hitting multiple keys when my fat fingers followed my eye's guidance to where the printed letter on the key is. If you can type without looking at the keyboard, then this would not be an issue at all. And I probably would have kept it hoping my eye/hand coordination would get used to it. But this keyboard's F keys aren't multi-function. On my old keyboard I could hold down an Fn key while hitting the F3 key, and my computer's volume would go up. Fn + F4 and I could mute. I use this a lot so I couldn't keep the keyboard. One other bit of weirdness - the WIN key said \"WIN\" instead of having the little Windows symbol. My eyes are trained to find those four little squares. This made it oddly slow using the WIN shortcuts.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this wireless keyboard and mouse combo to use with my work laptop. I was struggling with back pain and the wireless set up has enabled me to re-arrange my desk space, and set up a more ergonomic posture for long days behind the desk.The best part is now I can just grab my laptop and walk away from the desk without messing around with any cords, and the keyboard and mouse are ready for me as soon as I bring the laptop back to my desk, with no messing around with cords.It was super easy to set up--Just plug in the USB and it's ready to use. With just 1 USB plug for both the mouse and keyboard, it frees up an extra USB on my laptop to also charge my phone.The keyboard works great. No issues at all, and the key response is satisfying, but not loud. The mouse also reliably works as it should, no problems.To conclude, I do recommend this product, and I would buy it again!",

This keyboard has my feels a little scrambled. This keyboard and mouse set offers a decent keyboard and mouse for the price point. However- The buttons on the keyboard feel... Soft? I'm not sure how else to describe them... In order to not\"skip a letter when typing I have to apply more finger force than I have with any other keyboard. I don't want a keyboard to be so responsive that winking at it will hit a key but maaaah goodness - Trying to type on this keyboard is as exhausting as kneading dough or playing bass. So! If your vibe is wanting to type as aggressively as possible for every sentence or if you want a finger workout - Look no further. This is your keyboard.Summary: Not bad for the price. Typing is a workout and you might misspell words if you don't button smash. The mouse is a mouse, no issues there.PS - The only reasons I added the dates at the top is because I wanted to see if this keyboard was still within the return window.",
