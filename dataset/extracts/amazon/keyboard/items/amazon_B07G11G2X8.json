                "reviewText": "As someone who has used membrane keyboards all my life typing on this keyboard feels so effortless.I got the blue switches and this tactile feel and clicky sound is everything. My typing has improved in both speed and accuracy. Never liked silent keyboards as I need to hear the typing.My previous keyboard was a Logitech Wave and I literally had to slam down on the keys to type. With this keyboard my fingers just need to gently tap the keys for them to register.The macro keys are an amazing addition and I've used them to record my passwords which saves me time. The media keys have a nice feel to them and the volume/ light scroll button has that nice tactile feel and raises / lowers the volume / LEDs in perfect increments.The lighting is bright and the font, although very gamery, looks nice IMO. The software though needs improvement as there does not seem to be an option to control the side RGBs with it. Not a deal breaker by any means at all though.It also comes with 8 spare switches so you\u2019re good to go if any of them fail.One thing to note though there is a slight ping sound when you type but that seems to be a common feature of pre-built mechanical keyboards. It's caused by the springs and the aluminium plating of the keyboard. It does not bother me though as I usually wear headphones when I am at my PC. This is also prevalent in the bigger more expensive brand names I've read as well so not really a fault with the keyboard.If I had to pick one issue it would be the feet at the back. They feel a bit flimsy but they do their job well.I\u2019d highly suggest this keyboard to anyone wanting to get into mechanical keyboards as this has actually motivated to type more.",

                "reviewText": "So, I originally purchased 2 Corsair K70 keyboards a couple years back for 2 different computers. I wanted top of the line mechanical boards with customizable backlighting for my recording studio business, and I was ok paying the higher cost for a high end product. They needed 2 cables to interface to the computer, and the Corsair Icue software was kinda ridiculously confusing to use, despite recent revisions to it. It did let you set up different per-key lighting schemes for different programs, and it would automatically switch to those schemes when you opened each program, which was cool, but not hugely useful to me for the way I used it. Overall it was frustrating as hell to use, and with each software update my old settings seemed to disappear and I\u2019d have to re-setup everything again. Then I\u2019d basically have to re-learn the software each time I took an update because I didn\u2019t use it often enough to remember how to navigate it efficiently. So ultimately, I was constantly having to screw around trying to make it work for me.Then, one keyboard stopped working at all.Anyway, long story short, I threw them away out of disgust and frustration and replaced them with these.(Even then, purging the stupid software from my system got confusing and took some time, as it was affecting the lighting in the new boards in a weird way).Boom!! Better backlighting, more legible keycaps, great tactile feel, easily replaceable keys (they even come with spares), and so much less money than the previous boards that I can replace them three times over for the same money the other ones cost.Per-key lighting can be easily set up without using external software, and tweaked on the fly in 5 seconds. I actually bought 2 different models of these, the bigger one has volume control and transport and programmable macro buttons, and works just as well and easily as the smaller, less-featured model.If you\u2019re looking for an illuminated board, I think these are a great value and punch way above their cost in quality and usability.",

                "reviewText": "My wants for a perfect keyboard were \"manual light control\", \"softer and quieter key switches\", \"good quality\", \"decent backlighting\", \"easy to read keys\" and an attached palm rest that was worth a darn.So looking for a \"gaming keyboard\" with a decent palm rest, is like looking for a famous unicorn fart. All the supposed \"gaming keyboards\" that are on Amazon with a built in palm rest are complete garbage or so freaking expensive as to be out of my reach.So I had just given up. But then I found this keyboard by happen chance after watching Jayztwocents show a couple of cool keyboards and it renewed my desire to look for a better keyboard.I love that fact that it has the brown switches and you can manually set the colors without some crappy software.But it doesn't have a palm rest you say! Yes your right, it didn't : ) But I took a chance and purchased the NPET WR30 Keyboard Wrist Rest Pad here on Amazon with this keyboard and hoped for the best.I had an idea, but I didn't have a plan. You see, I type with my keyboard on my lap. And I absolutely have to have a palm rest when typing. So when it got here today, I took them both out and instantly knew that I was going to make this to work. Went digging around all the left overs from the garage and found some old plastic wall file holders and the fix was in. These were the older plastic type with a smoked color and around 1/8\" thick. Took me three times to get the cuts right, but in the end, I had what I needed.A platform to hold my keyboard and wrist rest together without any bulk. Scuffed it up and gave it a paint job, and with some Gorilla double stick tape, the new set up was finished. I took off the rubber pads from the wrist rest and applied them to the new base and walla, an awesome keyboard with an awesome wrist rest.I'll be honest, this is the first day. But I already know I will not be sending this baby back. It blows my other \"gaming keyboard\" right out of the door and the brown switches are so nice. The biggest sell for me though was the fact that they used a font that is so easy see. I can type pretty good, but the dang symbols on the top row have always been a bugger for me. So now I can see the right symbol when I need it.Typing on this thing is a dream. The added wrist rest is just the icing on the cake. Super comfy and at the perfect height.So if your looking for a good typing, er I mean \"gaming keyboard\" with the ability to add a really nice wrist rest super easily, then this is your keyboard and wrist rest combo. Super sturdy and it didn't add hardly any more weight to it.There is also a guy on Youtube that did a nice video explaining every light setting and macro setting walk through that I highly recommend titled \"Redragon K580 Vata RGB controls Tutorial\".Over all, the build is super nice. I did take the top cover off initially just to see what I was dealing with as far as space for fasteners (none). The internals are top notch, and with the aluminum top deck making a very sturdy keyboard for a very affordable price. I would highly recommend this keyboard no matter what keys you choose. Very well made, and well worth the money.",
