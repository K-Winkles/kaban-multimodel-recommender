The sleek all-black design adds to the aesthetics of my desk setup. Moreover, it offers excellent value for money, making it a hassle-free product. Logitech's reputation as a renowned brand is clearly built on the high satisfaction of users like me.Good Points:\u30fbIts compact ten-keyless design is fantastic for saving desk space.\u30fbThe sharp and precise keypresses make it enjoyable not just for gaming but also for various tasks like work.\u30fbThe backlighting allows for customization to match my mood or room ambiance.\u30fbThe durable aluminum top plate gives me confidence in its longevity; I've been using it for over six months without any issues.Areas for improvement:\u30fbDue to its black color, it tends to accumulate dust if not cleaned regularly. Periodic brushing or wiping with a microfiber cloth is necessary, though it may not bother most users.\u30fbI wish the material of the wired cable was of higher quality. There's room for improvement, like making the cable slightly thicker for durability or using a fabric sheath as an upgrade.",

I wanted a simple keyboard that works for programming, school, and gaming usage.The build quality is solid, fully functional, there\u2019s no rainbow circus lights that mostly every other gaming keyboard has, and there\u2019s NO rattly keys or annoying pinging noise. This keyboard is extremely good. I love it. I paired this keyboard up with a HyperX wrist rest I owned.Note: ignore glare in the photos is from my phone camera. There\u2019s no actual glare on the keys.",

                "reviewText": "I didn't buy this for gaming - I'm not a gamer. But, as a person who writes a lot, I spend quite a bit of time typing and, after reading about mechanical keyboards, I decided I ought to give one a try. I was somewhat overwhelmed by all the discussions of switch types but, since Kensington is a well-known brand with a reputation for quality, I decided to take a chance on this when I saw it at an attractive price. Since I haven't experimented with all of the various switch types I have to accept the possibility that there might be other keyboards out there that I'd like better but I find this to be a big improvement over the stock keyboard that came with my desktop computer. While I do believe that it's improved my typing accuracy I must admit that I probably couldn't justify the expense purely on that basis alone. But this keyboard exudes quality - it's heavy and stable and the nicely illuminated keys produce a satisfying click. The aesthetics of typing on this keyboard make writing more enjoyable and I'm glad I decided to treat myself!",

                "reviewText": "Seems well built - but definitely loud (about 65db+ when typing). Key travel is good, layout is right size. I was expecting something that said \"compatible with Mac\" and has the Mac actions on the function keys to actually have the ability to put on Mac keycaps, but this does not have it. As a result I have to leave it with Windows labels on the keys, and then swapped the \"modifier\" keys by switching the Command and Option keys in the system settings, and now the keys are essentially all in the right place. If you need to do this - go to Settings, search for \"keyboard modifiers\" and just switch those two keys.I'd also like a software option to switch off the Function keys and make it the action keys (volume up/down, play/pause music, etc) to be on permanently so I don't have to push the function key to do these things. Supposedly there is a system setting for this, but I have been unsuccessful in making it work.",

                "reviewText": "(black G413 TKL SE)No, this isn't a true budget mechanical (there are plenty of $25-$40 no-name mechanicals out there), though it's about as cheap as you'll find a true mechanical from a major brand-name maker....however, it's better made, with nicer materials, fit-n-finish and better key feel than the cheaper 'boards I've used and at a price that's still within reach for most gamers (or folks who just prefer the feel of mechanical over membrane).This \"SE\" version of the G413 was purchased to replace my first gen. G413, which suffered a failed W key after three years of nightly gaming use. The SE has better key action and a more solid key feel than the earlier version, it also has more texture on the key cap surface and touts a new key cap material (this is a welcome upgrade, as I was starting to see the paint wear off around letters on my WASD keys on the OG version). The \"board\"/deck of the keyboard is similar to the older version, which is to say it's very solid and well made, but the SE forgoes the USB port and dual cable of the original, it also doesn't show up as a recognized device on Logitech's G Hub software anymore.Key feel is a personal preference, so my 5 stars may be your 1 star... I'd call these switches a blending of a Cherry brown and blue switch as far as character: they're sprung stiffer and have a more noticeable break point than a brown switch, but aren't as firm or crisp as a blue and more importantly, are as quiet as a brown switch, overall a very pleasant compromise in my book. If anything, I'd say they have a more solid feel than even genuine Cherry switches and easily best the first gen. Logitech mechanical and Chinese Cherry-esque switches in feel and solidity.I love this keyboard for the fact that it has a solid deck, good cable, great key feel and simple LED backlighting, I feel like it's a much better value than a no-name board for $30 less, or a top of the line name-brand board at up to hundreds of dollars more.Multi-color, per key programmable, flashing, color wave LED \"features\" add nothing to the gaming (or typing in subdued light) experience for me and I hate paying extra for stuff that I just have to figure out how to disable... Thanks Logitech!As far as TKL 'boards in general go, they're certainly not for everyone... I like TKL better than 60% (though I still miss my num pad) and it does still reclaim a sizeable chunk of real estate on my desk for mouse over-run compared to a full sized keyboard, which in my case is a real advantage in sweaty PvP gaming situations.Having directly accessible F keys and full size style arrow, del/ins, etc. keys is definitely worth the added width for me, but smaller desks or gaming only rigs might still be better with 60%, YMMV.",
