Revelation 20:15 AMPTherefore if anyone is in Christ [that is, grafted in, joined to Him by faith in Him as Savior], he is a new creature [reborn and renewed by the Holy Spirit]; the old things [the previous moral and spiritual condition] have passed away.

You can turn the rbg on and off with a key on the keyboard. It has a power switch on the back. It takes USB-C charging. The key sounds are very similar to a mechanical keyboard. None of the keys are sticky It is a very nice small compact keyboard. The USB dongle comes in the back, and it has two kickstands to sit it up. it's a very well made keyboard plug it right in and it starts up. Would recommend a hundred times more.

Sometimes you need to unplug and replug the USB dongle to get it recognized. After that it seems to work fine for a few days. Battery life seems perfectly reasonable, although I haven't stretched it yet to see if it follows the claims.Would I recommend it? Absolutely for the price for a kid that may destroy it tomorrow by accidentally dropping it or stepping on it. The connection issues are the only thing keeping it from 5 stars.",

The fact that is wireless gives you a lot more freedom on where to put it, and it saves you from those cables. Everything works as advertised, RGB works great, you can't really notice any delay. Kind of sad I didn't order the whole pack with mouse, but I think their keyboard is really good and would definitely recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "If you're trying out keyboard and mouse to play video games for the first time, as I am, this is a great keyboard to start out with. It comes with rgb (which is cool) but you cannot change the color, it's just set for you. The keyboard feels sturdy but weighs a considerable amount given how small it is, whether or not that's because of the RGB or not is unknown to me. I would give this a higher rating but it just costs a lot and is very clicky. I understand the majority of people like loud and clicky keyboards but personally, I do not. I wish there was an option to request it being a silent click keyboard or a loud click keyboard, or even just put in the details that it's a loud keyboard. I also learned that you can have the RGB fade in and out (I do not know why or if it's a color code option). Overall, for a starter keyboard, it's not bad but for the price that it is, you can find something cheaper that's just as good.",
