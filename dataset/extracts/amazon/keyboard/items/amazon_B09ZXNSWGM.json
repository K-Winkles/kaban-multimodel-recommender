I\u2019m currently using this as my backup keyboard, but I can say that in terms of comfort, typing on this is great and the led colors are really cute. I also like that you can turn off and on the led when it\u2019s convenient for you. HOWEVER, I will say, I believe this is advertised as a quiet keyboard. I actually prefer loud keyboards when I\u2019m working, it\u2019s something about the sound that helps me focus, so I was worried about how productive I would be working with a quiet keyboard but this is not quiet. I actually really enjoyed working with this Because it\u2019s pretty loud. I do have a typewriter keyboard and that is much louder than this one but this should not be advertised as a quiet keyboard. I did record a little sound example so you can see for yourself if this is quiet enough for you. I\u2019ve worked on keyboards that were much much quieter than this btw. If the silent keyboard is what your looking for then this is not it, but if the noise level is not an issue for you then I recommend getting this because the clicking sounds are really nice to listen to and the keyboard is cute and comfy.",

                "reviewText": "Great price point, but the backslash and Enter keys are not located out in the standard positions, which I have found to be really annoying as it causes typing errors and doesn't align to other keyboards, which messes with my typing muscle memory. Also the font on the keys is oddly cut off in places and slightly difficult to read, which is minor, but still another negative aspect.It's not worth a return for me at this point, but I probably wouldn't have ordered it if I realized it was like this.",

                "reviewText": "Pros: RGB lights are soft instead of blinding, easy to adjust brightness, satisfying clicky sound from keys*, all keys responsiveCons: Text on some keys hard to read - not an issue on the main keys but worse on keys with full words on them, it can be a bit hard to get used to the unusual enter key shape (it's like the kind commonly found on cash registers instead)*: I know it's advertized as having silent keys, but I like tactile keys with satisfying clickiness so when I saw some reviews here complaining about the keys not being silent I checked a few of the video reviews and decided to get it. So while the click-clacks are a big yes for me, they might not be for everyone.",

There is not a lot of subtly with the dimming or brightening of the keys but its not a critical concern. I dont use it for gaming so how good it is for that I dont know. But as a pretty substitute for a standard typing keyboard at a sensible price its two thumbs up. I would have preferred more packaging, neighborhood doesn't need to know I'm buying a keyboard. Was delivered on time with no fuss. Thanks.",
