CThe mouse\u2026. The mouse is just terrible. I don\u2019t know how anyone can use it. Also super light and feels very cheap.

No special installation needed. Keyboard and mouse are both lightweight and easy to handle. Not sure how the battery life will be. Both devices require two AA batteries. However, unlike other wireless setups I have used in the past, neither have an off/on switch. I am assuming they go to sleep when the computer/laptop is off. No issues so far with the replacement product that was sent. Keystrokes are not as quiet as expected but not loud and heavy either. Not bad for the price.",

I\u2019ve gotten one just like it at five below and it was the same quality, cheap. Very light weight. The scroll will jam and freeze up and not even scroll the direction you\u2019re scrolling. It\u2019s going back. The color is cute but other than that it\u2019s not super reliable for functional needs.",

I find it more efficient to use the keyboard for many of the functions that most people younger than I do with the mouse. As such, I decided I needed to spend another $5 to get dedicated HOME, Pgup, Pgdn and shortcut menu keys.",
