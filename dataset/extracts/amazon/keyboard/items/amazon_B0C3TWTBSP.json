The led animations are cool, but not very functional except for the dedicated game mode. Metal build plastic on the bottom, not a lot of flex for a cheap mechanical keyboard.Checked the back of the keyboard and it was recently QC 08/20 so these have been in the market only recently.Which confuses me why there are reviews of a different product on this keyboard.It is alright for the price for a fairly well built keyboard. Just wished that I could have the whole keyboard light up one color instead of the rgb rows which are somewhat annoying. I would recommend you get a wrist rest if you are buying these.Cannot day what they will be in a couple months but so far 4 stars.",

                "reviewText": "Honestly, I didn't have super high hopes for this keyboard when I purchased it, but I decided to pull the trigger because it's actually going to be used by a little guy and I figured he wouldn't notice the difference between this and my Red Dragon. To my surprise, I barely notice the difference when it comes to banging away on these keys! They definitely feel like blue keys to me and there's actually less of a metallic ring at the bottom that you experience with some keyboards.The led's are bight and the character key lettering is crisp. The instructions are clear and it's super easy to change the lighting pattern. There is a setting that allows you to customize the lighting pattern for gaming, and you *can* set individual keys. The built in patterns are pretty basic, but do the job if you want to mix it up. Now of course at 1/2 the price of some of the other keyboards out there, you will notice some differences and one of those is the lack of any SUPER customizable patterns or settings but what counts for me is that this keyboard goes way beyond being just a static rainbow keyboard with simple variations of rainbow. I certainly recommend this keyboard for those wanting great value for their money",
