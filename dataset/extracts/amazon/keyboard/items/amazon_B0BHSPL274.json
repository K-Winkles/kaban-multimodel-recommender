This is a solid, heavy keyboard with a small form factor. The thick USB-C to USB-A cable is a plus, & the lighting (although limited to one color) is fantastic. It\u2019s bright & it looks good. The build quality is enough to justify this purchase alone. This thing feels better than some other $100+ keyboards I\u2019ve owned in the past. The only gripe I have with it is the actual font of the keycaps - but I can easily switch the key caps out in the future. The media keys & the Windows lock button are also an added bonus. I am very impressed.",

                "reviewText": "Not much to say.It's a really nice small form keyboard. It uses off brand switches that mimic cherry.It's a really good way to help introduce someone to a mechanical keyboard.I've had very little issues with the keyboard itself. Periodically the D key will give me some trouble. Aside from that the keys feel very smooth. They are crisp and easy to type on. The function keys are really nice. They all work as expected.The lighting is very nice. You can switch between a handful of different patterns. Just know that you are stuck with blue.I wouldn't use this for gaming. (Since the D key gives me trouble periodically. Put it to your imagination) But, for working in the office its a really great keyboard. I am well happy.",

You can\u2019t find a better keyboard for the price. Easily could be sold for double the price. My only concern is the key caps shown have limited printing on them, while the subtle, the actual key caps have extra printing on them for the light controls.",
