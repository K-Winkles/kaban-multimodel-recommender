                "reviewText": "This is my first Amazon review, and I did use this keyboard a year first before posting the review for a holistic, time-tested experience. The mouse and keyboard are very durable and of excellent quality. I purchased in 6/14 and today is 7/8 \u2014 which means I have experienced 0 problems and a happy year of dependable, efficient usage.The keyboard is very energy efficient and uses 2 AAA batteries. It\u2019s been a year now but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve changed the battery yet in the keyboard yet.The mouse has gone through 2 battery replacements. But because I use computer for work, school, heavy coding, gaming, and artistic projects, it\u2019s to be expected. The mouse also glows in a tiny orange light when it\u2019s 5-7 days away from needing a replacement so you can know in advance and not face a sudden dead-battery incident. (I have gone through days of gaming with that little orange light and the mouse still works and delivers) It is pretty unbelievably good for the $30 I\u2019ve paid on this set.SURVIVED COFFEE ATTACK from Cat Knockover.Cats, am I right? I work, take classes, and teach classes, at home and my feline buddies are a constant variable in my life. A week ago, one knock over my coffee ( Large size - Hot ) when I went on a 5min bathroom break. I came back fully expecting the keyboard not to work. But once I wiped it down, I\u2019m very pleasantly surprised and relieved that I can still work. Half of the keyboard was completely soaked by sweet brown coffee but seems fine. . . ? I\u2019ve gone a week since and there were no key failures. The quality endures!Some keys were sticky, like Crtl, Fn, Shift and so forth. I was planning to buy a new one but decided to try cleaning the sticky ones with some cotton balls, tissue, and rubbing alcohol. Works like a charm and now I DONT NEED TO Buy a new keyboard!Super good quality and it does survive liquid accidents. :) Take that, Cat!Buy this! I\u2019m legit too happy, especially since it\u2019s gone $2 cheaper than a year ago.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this combo in May 2023. Some weeks later the prints of numbers and letters started to fade. Some letters are not readable anymore in September. But it comes worse. I needed to change three times the batteries in the keyboard. But sometimes the keystrokes produces ten times the same letter, even I only pressed the key one time. Just a week ago, the mouse started to open and close websites, I did not even click on. And often, when I click a link or a buttom the mouse does not react at all. Buttom line is. This product is in my personal perception absolute garbage. However, I had Microsoft and Logitech keyboards before, who also only lived one year. But within four month only this Lenovo combo died. Remarkable. Today, I will order a Cherry keyboard combo. Let's see how that works out.",
