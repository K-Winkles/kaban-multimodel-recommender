No real \"bells or whistles\" on this, but it is very efficient and contains the essentials: function, windows, and 10-key all with the standard keyboard. The price was in a fair range and no difficulty installing and using right away. Design is lightweight, but it's sturdy and has \"legs\" if you prefer to slant the keyboard. The cord is a good 3 feet long.",

But about the keyboard !It's a keyboard. The colour is all that it really has going for it, although even that is less vibrant than I expected. It's very light-weight and the plastic has... texture to it. I am very sensitive when it comes to texture so it might be less noticeable to others but the plastic is not smooth, I can say that.It's going to take some getting used to but that's usual when switching keyboards. It's been good so far though ! No reason to not give five stars (yet but hopefully never).Keyboard :)",

It arrived quickly and she was able to set up by herself. She has a think pad (laptop). The connection is constant and very easy to set up. She is very happy with her new keyboard and prefers it over the laptop keyboard.",
