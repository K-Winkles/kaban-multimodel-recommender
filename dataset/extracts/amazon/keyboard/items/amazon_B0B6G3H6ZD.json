                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this keyboard and mouse set. It worked really well with absolutely no issues for over a year. I moved offices and with my new setup, the mouse is really lagging. I read other reviews that mention this, but I never had the issue at all until moving offices. I do really think it is due to the proximity of the mouse to the usb that goes into your laptop or tower. I want to believe this is the problem, but sometimes I have it right next to the connection and it still lags. The lag is so bad that it makes it almost unusable. I would normally just think that based on the price the unit is just ready to be replaced and happily buy a new one. However, based on the other reviews, I worry a new one might have the same issue and I was lucky to get a mouse that worked for over a year with my first purchase.",
