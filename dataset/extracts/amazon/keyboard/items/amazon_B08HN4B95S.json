It's a full sized keyboard.I was disappointed that the function keys for audio controls cannot be used without pressing the Fn key. That's just the way it is. It is not something wrong with the product. It's just a feature I would have liked. BUT... I also had sticky, non-responsive keys. It was clunky. Again, I just considered that they way it was for what I paid for. I wasn't going to return, complain or leave a review.Then I got the fishing email for a review and because it was just between the seller and I, I told them my concerns: the Fn key function and the sticky keys. They explained about the Fn key. Truthfully I wasn't even aware that I used that often, but I do. My 2nd concern was a sticky backspace key that I had to fiddle with to find the sweet spot to make it connect. Really many of the keys were clunky and loud, but that was the way it was.They forwarded my concerns.. and WITHOUT ASKING for it, sent a replacement... WHICH WORKS GREAT.",

                "reviewText": "WOW, what an awesome keyboard! I had a pretty good one for my HP desktop but over the years it got worn down and my spacebar was ready to fall off and the \"E\" key was simply flat and had no spring to it and would sometimes work and sometimes not. I find most current keyboards, especially the Apple keyboard with those super small and totally flat keys that is more fitting with someone's hands the size of a little kid to use instead of a grown 250 lb. man with massive hands and fingers to be absolutely ridiculous beyond belief.I also absolutely loathe wireless keyboards and the delayed reaction. So I searched a lot for a new keyboard that I thought would be good for me. I saw this X9 Performance for $30 and took a chance. And my God, I am so happy with my purchase! This WIRED keyboard works perfectly with my HP desktop and the keys are nice and big for my huge fingers and are raised and have awesome spring back to them. I am VERY happy with this keyboard and the price is something you can't beat. Makes those newer, small keyed and flat keyed keyboards seem like the junk that they are. Why on earth anyone would like those keyboards is beyond words.One thing about the X9, if you buy one and can't figure out how to turn the volume up or down or mute it, I will tell you how. There is a key two spots to the right of the space bar with blue letters \"Fn\". Hold it down and use F2, F3 and F4 to control the volume. Overall a great keyboard that I rate a 10/10. I might buy 2-3 more for usage on future desktops since it seems like most new computers come with those ridiculous small keyboards that someone with super small baby hands would still have a hard time using.",

It is not something you tend to think of, but the placement of the keys are very important. With other keyboards I have used of late, I constantly hit the wrong keys. This is because there is just a very slight difference in placement. Such a simple thing, but very important nonetheless.The keys are responsive with very little pressure. The cable is a generous length and though my CPU is at the opposite end of the desk there is additional cable length. This is perhaps a little more expensive than other basic keyboards. This one has a good advantage though, the antimicrobial component. With all the concern around Covid, this sort of thing is needed now more than ever.",

                "reviewText": "Membrane keyboards are not my first choice, but this one ranks even lower than most. The reason is that the keys need a lot of pressure to activate. I feel like I'm pounding on the keys in order to get them working. There is a lot of resistance, and the keys need to bottom out before producing a character.The antimicrobial aspect is only good at the level where goop meets key. Any build-up, things like grease or food particles, for instance, on the keys, will still have active bacteria on top of it, so this is a sort of misleading feature.On the upside, the long USB cable can be a blessing if it has to run to the back of a desk and then down to the PC sitting on a floor.The whole thing is lightweight, and I found that it moved too easily on the desktop is I wasn't careful.As with almost all keyboards today, the top row of \"F\" keys all have secondary functions in Windows.Considering that the only selling point that other keyboards in this class don't have is the only somewhat useful antimicrobial treatment, this is an expensive option.",

It's not expensive or fancy, and in years past it'd be just another in a sea of similar devices.But this is the era of COVID, and this keyboard has a hidden feature: it's anti-microbial. Germs don't like the silver/zinc material infused into the plastic.So while it's not a heavy-duty keyboard, it is a good choice for multi-user workstations, or for working near sick/vulnerable people.Two things I'd like to note:1. The indicator lights are very small, and so dim that they're hard to see even at close range. Not usually a big deal, but can be annoying.2. This one's just a personal preference: I've used ergonomically curved keyboards for so long that I can barely type on a standard one any more. If the manufacturer offered a curved version I'd go for it in a heartbeat.",
