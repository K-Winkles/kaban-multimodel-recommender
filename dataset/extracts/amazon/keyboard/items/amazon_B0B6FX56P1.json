                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This review is for the Green Wireless Keyboard and Mouse, KOOTOP Cute Green Colorful Keyboard and Mouse, 2.4G Wireless Keyboard with Retro Round Keycap for PC, Mac, Laptop,Tablet,Computer Windows (Green)\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026 \u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026 \u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026To summarize this item in one word - FANTASTIC!The Look - The design is very welcoming & user friendly. In comparison to a common work keyboard (LOGI K360) it is a similar layout. The KOOTOP keyboard is about 2-inches longer that a common work keyboard & is about 1/2-inch thicker. The base of the keyboard has a smooth, glossy finish which is very easy to clean. The keys are a smooth matte finish & the key labels are stickers on the keys. The key shape is a nontraditional, typewriter kind of shape. If you don\u2019t have long nails, these keys are nicely designed to fit your finger without being too close to each other. Certain keys do not have written indicators (tab, shift, delete, enter) however it is clearly translated what those keys are meant for. The mouse has a matte finish on the bottom & a smooth glossy finish on top. There are 4 buttons on the mouse: left click, right click, the scrolling wheel, & a side trigger (preferable for PC gaming). It is about the same size as a common work mouse & fits very comfortable in your hand.The Function - The KOOTOP keyboard works as well as a standard keyboard. The keys all have immediate responses & are very easy to press on. Despite the gaps between the keys, I do not struggle with hitting the right key/falling into the gaps. I wear acrylic nails, so while I see multiple people speaking to the quietness of the keyboard I unfortunately cannot relate. For us gel tipped superstars, the key tapping can be a little louder than those with shorter nails but it\u2019s not that abrasive, high pitched, scratching sound you get from hitting a key on a Mac/LOGI keyboard. I\u2019ve included a video for reference. The mouse is a low, pleasant click & is also very responsive in click & scroll. The mouse won\u2019t work unless you click to wake it. Both operate on one double-A (AA) battery each & batteries are provided.The Feel - This might sound a little extra, but this keyboard genuinely makes me want to sit down & type. The color wave & the sound make this keyboard a very inviting tool - especially for work. The color options give a choice for every aesthetic & vibe (that being said, GIVE MORE COLOR OPTIONS!). I can\u2019t think of anyone who wouldn\u2019t benefit from the experience of this keyboard.Tldr; Buy it, love it, thank me later \u2728",

The mouse will turn off after a while and you need to turn it off then on again for it to work. It is a bit frustrating to have to turn it back on instead of moving the mouse like other wireless ones. If you are constantly using your mouse it should not be an issue for you.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The set comes with the 104 keys typewriter keyboard, the mouse and two batteries. It's totally wireless and doesn't need to be charged. There are two AA batteries included where on has to be added to the keyboard and one to the mouse. There's no on or off button. The mouse and keyboard start automatically working when any button is pressed and go into sleep again after about 10 minutes. So the battery can last for up to 18 months. The keyboard is comfortable, has even a kick-stand to elevate it in the back and comes with 4 soft rubber feet and is pretty silent to type with and has even 13 multi media buttons for volume, e-mail and many more functions. The mouse has a dedicated back button, a soft and comfortable scroll wheel and works even on white and shiny surfaces. The 2.4g USB dongle which connects mouse and keyboard, is in the mouse which you can just add to any USB-A port of your computer and wait for the confirmation that it has been connected (full plug and play) and then you can start typing and using the mouse. Love it for the colors, the style and how comfortable it is to use.",
