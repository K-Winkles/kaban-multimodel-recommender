Only issue I ran into is the middle of the keyboard dipped down when typing. The overall thickness and strength of the keyboard isn't great. I added some felt adhering strips to the middle of the keyboard at the front and it eliminated the issue.I don't believe you can change the color of the keyboard colors, which is a drag, but I don't recall the manufacturer indicating you could, so it isn't a draw back to me.The mouse is solid. The color change automatically on it, which is cool. The buttons all seem to work well.I would recommend this keyboard/mouse combo to someone looking for a cool aesthetic to their computer without the ability to do too much customization.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this as I've been wanting to try this style keyboard for some time; I work at night so I am always trying to lessen eye strain and thought this would be perfect.For the most part, this is what it claims to be, a back-lit keyboard. Trouble is, the letters are left out of the keys themselves so they appear as a gray screen of plastic to let the colors in, but the opacity is still too strong on the letters/numbers themselves, especially any buttons in the corners. Had they been made of a clear plastic rather than a grey, the letters would be much more visible. Even in complete darkness with just the keyboard lit, I still have to squint at some of the buttons, especially the Fn buttons.As a whole, the keyboard itself is built in the standard way except for (1) the extra light on-off switch on the front and the brand name in a big plastic rectangle above the directional buttons. Another Issue is that (2) it feels very cheap; the buttons are elevated on springs above a flat sheet of plastic which will allow for much more dust and grime to sneak into it. There are also not kickstand pieces on the back of it like traditional keyboards have; I've had to prop mine up on a small cardboard box.The mouse is the least problematic thing in this set, though the black center button doesn't appear to do anything at all and the colors go through the entire range of colors automatically.",

The mouse is good i keep it as a spare for when my 80 dollar logitech wireless trackball starts having issues. The wired mouse on this is just fine, even has 2 lighting modes.",
