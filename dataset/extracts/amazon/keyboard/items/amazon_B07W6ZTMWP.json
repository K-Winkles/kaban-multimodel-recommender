                "reviewText": "I'm a gamer. I play A LOT of video games (not competitively and I don't have Twitch, but you get the idea). I need fast response time in games like Fortnite and Dead by Daylight, etc. Team games, shooters, etc.At the same time, I'm not willing to spend $100+ on a keyboard/mouse setup. This keyboard and mouse package does the job.It's beautiful. The keys are responsive and have a satisfying noise. There's a click but it's not super loud, and the keys are very comfortable to push down. It lights up beautifully. There's just one color (blue) but you can set it to stationary or pulsing (press and hold FN and Esc to toggle)The mouse is very similar to a Razer mouse. It's incredibly comfortable. And best of all, there's no audible mouse click. It pleasantly surprised me.The cords are the nice cloth kind, they're not cheap. And a bonus is that they're pink because it's easy to see what cords the mouse and keyboard are when you plug them into your computer, vs. all the cords being black.Did I mention how pretty this setup is? It's even prettier in person. The keyboard itself is clear with pink buttons. The letters are clear, and the light comes through.Overall, 10/10, would happily buy again.",

                "reviewText": "The colors are lighting options are great on the keyboard and mouse. I'm giving 5 stars cause the price is the best around. It's weird cause the mouse is silent but the keyboard isn't. It'd also be nice if there were those little pop out stands that are normally on keyboards. It isn't raised enough and hurts my wrists typing all day long. I have to buy a separate stand to raise it. But no other keyboard had the colors how I wanted so I'm ok with spending another 10 bucks to make it more comfy.",

                "reviewText": "i have had this for 10 days now. I needed a new keyboard and mouse so i got this one. i like the keyboard, its great, i think the only issue with that is the number lock key doesn't work and even if i press it, the number pad is still usable? not sure if that is a problem anyone else is having. all of the keys work fine, they are smooth and ergonomically easy to use. the spacebar is a little more clacky compared to the other keys (i am kind of picky on the sound of my keys) and while the smaller keys sound smooth and soft the spacebar is a louder clack but i can easily overlook that when thinking about how cheap this keyboard is compared to others. the mouse is ok, it kind of messed with my scrolling settings for a bit where it went against the normal scrolling and it was a default thing that kept happening. but after a few times of using it, it stopped changing the scroll direction and it works normal now. easy to hook up and use. at first i tried to see if there was a way to change the color options but now it doesn't bother me that you can't choose your own colors. the gradient movement that the keyboard comes with and is normally set to is not distracting and I've gotten used to it now. mouse is a bit laggy but that's ok. overall i would probably buy it again.",

                "reviewText": "To be clear, I'm not big on what qualifies as a top of the line gaming keyboard. To my knowledge, all the top of the line gaming keyboards are going to cost over $100 dollars for a keyboard alone. They usually have a wrist-rest and interchangeable keys. I'm coming from a keyboard that had for years been falling apart and a mouse that was for a turn of the century Mac so literally buying anything would be a step up, lol.To start, the keyboard feels good. There's still some clicking and clacking to be had, but compared to my previous keyboard (An outdated logitech trash fire that was missing screws with a number of numeric keys no longer operational) The keyboard also has a good weight to it and doesn't slide all over the desk. Without the arm rest below the keyboard, it's actually great for me and the limited desk space I have.Something I didn't expect was the RGB settings. It has a lot. 6-7 colors with various modes, like breathings, rainbow-cycling - All which can have the speed of which they display changed by holding ESC+FN keys.The mouse was more simple. Standard Right/Left Click, Scroll Wheel, 2 right side thumb clicks with a DPI button below the scroll wheel to cycle thru colors or DPI Key+ Side Key on the mouse adjust single color modes that only seem to do breathing color (Fading in and out) I was able to match my keyboard and mouse to a pretty Cyan/Purple Neon to match the RGB lights in my tower and they look really cool together.Both Keyboard and Mouse use their dedicated USB cords which for the most part are decent lengths and not totally intrusive (I have minimal desk space for all my music/art crap, mind you) One cable has a somewhat fat USB connector for some reason, making a tight fit for any other USB next to it which seems a bit pointless.All and all it still gets an all star review from me. I tested gaming with Doom Eternal and the key inputs fell into place, with the mouse feeling like a good fit with the extra side keys being used for up close Melee.If you're like me and your keyboard mouse set up was a dumpster fire, this is a great upgrade. I don't usually write reviews but I'm happy with my purchase. Someday maybe I'll step up tot he world of customizable gaming keyboards but I'm in no rush with this set up. :)",

There is no keyboard stand on it but it does have good grip so it doesn't slide. Keyboard surprisingly a little bit heavy.",

The colours themselves are really nice and you can dim/brighten them. The feel of the keys is a heavy, yet soft feeling, somewhat satisfying as odd as that sounds lol.The clear surround for the light to bounce off of is a lovely touch as well.The keyboard has quite a bit of weight to it which is actually awesome in terms of it not moving while you're typing away so I imagine this would be a gamers advantage also.The mouse: I wasn't sure how I felt about a light up mouse to begin with, but it's actually quite nice. My old mouse had the back/forward buttons on the side and I could not live without them so to find this magical combo where the mouse had that feature is like winning the lotto for me. The click functions on the left and right is amazing. I don't even know how to put it into words, it's soft... but not? There's literally no sound when you click too which is quite nice.I would 100% recommend this to any living and breathing person. If you don't like it, there's something wrong with you lol.",
