It comes with a silicone cover to put over the buttons for everyday use and i love it. im actually wearing it down and would love to buy just another silicone matt to replace this one. keeps me from getting my keys stuck with dirt and dust and still get the full color and cuteness of the keyboard. O! the mouse is perfect too, i have smaller hands and cant with the bulky mouses so this one is perfect! will update with pictures later!EDIT: After about 11 months the mouse isn't working. i keep it clean, change out the batteries and have a pretty clean station so idk why its not working, it seems like the laser on the bottom isnt good anymore, time to get a new mouse. Keyboard is still working great though!",

So there\u2019s definitely a lot of lag whenever you go to double check paperwork or take a sip of water. Super frustrating.

So pretty \ud83e\udd79 though I\u2019m a little bit disappointed cause the copy and paste function doesn\u2019t work on this keyboard. I\u2019m using a MacBook Air M2. I was also expecting the free usb to usb-c converter cause it\u2019s included in the product description but got a matching keyboard protector for it. It was nice though to keep the dust away from my keyboard. Anyway thank you! Just half regret buying it because I\u2019m very disappointed that the copy and paste function doesn\u2019t work, I use it all the time for my work and now I will have a hard time because I can\u2019t use the copy and paste function \ud83e\udee4",

That would be extremely beneficial so as to prevent repetitive strain injuries and also reduce the stress on carpal tunnel syndrome.I do love the aesthetic though and it's very light weight and simple to set up.",
