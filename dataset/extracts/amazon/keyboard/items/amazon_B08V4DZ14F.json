                "reviewText": "It is NOT an RGB keyboard. It is white backlit. As long as you know that, you should love this keyboard. I did not have the problem with the faceplate being lose like some of the other reviewers did. Not sure if this is a hit or miss issue or something the manufacturer solved but my faceplate is extremely sturdy.Very clicky and light sound to the keys (blue switches, clicky-er than red). If you're not wanting a super clicky keyboard, this one probably isn't for you. I would go for red switches for that normal keyboard sound or brown for a super soft sound.Very easy to pick the lighting set up you want. 6 brightness settings, a ton of different options for customizing how your keyboard lights up, and very responsive lighting when you select an option that breathes when you click certain keys. Responsiveness works to a certain point (it only allows for three animations running at one point) but it still looks gorgeous no matter what.Every key works, none of the keys are loose. I switched the stock keys out for some pudding keycaps and they are GORGEOUS on this keyboard. The entire thing is pink, including the cord, which fits with my desk setup very nicely. I added some teal and lilac pudding keycaps and switched the stock keycaps over to another keyboard (that had cherry switches) and everything works perfectly.The only issue I'm running into (and only on certain apps, so it may be more of an application issue than an issue with my keyboard), is that sometimes the 'e' key duplicates or doesn't want to type out the letter. So far as I'm writing this, I haven't had that issue so it may just be with a certain application on my computer causing that.Sidenote, I love that there's two kickstand heights on the back of the keyboard. I don't elevate my keyboard usually but I like the comfort of having it elevated on the smallest kickstand.",

Not sure how to fix it at the moment, and it's getting annoying. Also, the light settings seem a bit wonky running under Linux. (I use Mint). I'm sure I turn off the lights then suddenly they're on again. Might be a Linux thing, might be the keyboard.I love the feel of the red switches though. Not loud like blue, yet still have a nice click, in my opinion.Overall, I think it is a good keyboard. I do not know if the switches are swappable.",

                "reviewText": "It's hard to beat this keyboard for the price -- a lot of basic, membrane-type keyboards cost more than this mechanical keyboard does. I purchased this keyboard for work, as the blue-switch keyboard I was using previously was driving my coworkers crazy.The red switches feel good overall and are a lot quieter than those blues, while still having a bit of sound (which I wanted). The spacebar does have a bit of a rattle / squeak, which would probably bother me if I was using this as my primary gaming keyboard; for basic work-oriented typing, though, it's fine for me. One of my coworkers liked the keyboard so much, he went out and purchased the same one for himself.I like that the keyboard is full-sized, as I need the numpad to do my job. I also like that it has a smaller ANSI-style Enter key; a lot of the cheaper mechanical keyboards available have the larger L shaped Enter key, which drives me bonkers.While I don't typically care about keyboard lighting schemes, I do actually enjoy the way this keyboard lights up by default -- pressing a key releases a \"wave\" of blue lights that spreads out from the key pressed throughout the rest of the keyboard. It makes for a neat appearance.I've been using the keyboard for about a month now and it's still functioning as expected. I don't imagine it will last all that long, but for the price it's well worth the cost.",
