I was able to plug it in to my computer USB port, & it started right up - no special problems. I really like the narrower width without the numbers-keypad on the right. . . because it's smaller that way, it fits better into my 21.5\" wide pull-out keyboard tray that's part of my desk - allowing room on the right for my mouse. The keys on the keyboard are normally-spaced & have a nice clicky-feel to them. Price was good - I definitely recommend this smaller wired keyboard!",

I love the fact that the buttons and layout are exactly the same. There was literally no learning curve for me to use this keyboard. As others as said, the aluminum finish on the Macbook is slightly lighter than this keyboard, but for me that is okay. It is a little noisy but that doesn't bother me either. All in all, great keyboard for $30.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great little keyboard, especially if you have a Mac and run Windows on the same machine, through VMWare, RDP or dual booting.Pros:1. It has both a delete and a backspace key, which is great for Windows. It also has a prntscreen for Windows.2. Typing quality is good. Not as good as a genuine Apple keyboard, but good enough, considering the price.3. Very narrow and lets you keep your mouse close and minimized the distance to reach out to the mouse.Cons:1. Feels a little cheap, but not too bad.2. No USB port on it to connect the mouse, like an genuine Apple keyboard would. Not a deal breaker, but it would have been nice.3. I'm a software engineer, so I use all kinds of multi-key key combinations for shortcuts in editing code. Since this keyboard does not have the home, end, insert, delete, page up, and page down keys, you have to press the 'fn' key and then an arrow key to get the same effect. This works fine, but then when you need a 3-key combination, like shift-control-end, shift-control-page down, etc., it doesn't work. Seems the keyboard was not designed for multi-key combinations when using the 'fn' key.Because of the limitations I mention in Con #3, I returned the keyboard. However, if you don't do these wild key combinations, then I would be totally fine with the keyboard. Most users will not encounter this limitation in browsing the web, writing emails, etc.",

                "reviewText": "I search Amazon for quite some time looking for the right wired keyboard that would help my poor eyes easily make out the keys. I saw many that would have done except that they were all monochromatic, not good. After getting discouraged, I clicked on a blurry photo that turned out to be this model and I'm glad I did! The black keys against the silver background is just what I was looking for, I can't believe more manufactures don't realize how important this can be!It arrived quickly and I was immediately satisfied as soon as I took it out of the box. In testing the spacing of the keys seems to be a near exact match as that on the laptop I'm replacing. The Keys have a little more resistance than what I am used to but I think is not really a big deal. The Fn key is in a bad spot in my opinion, but again, not too big of a deal. The only thing that could make me like this keyboard any more than I do now is if it were made of aluminum instead of plastic! Again, not a big deal!! As you can see from the photo attached I'm using this with my new setup, an Elitedesk 800 G4 Mini paired with a third party small touchscreen monitor and usb mouse. I plan to replace my laptop with this setup and needed everything to be small for portability. This keyboard really completes the setup, I'm so happy!!!",

                "reviewText": "I have had this keyboard for a few months it's a great space saver on you desk top and the keys have a very good tactile feel in my opinion. However, I wish I had sprung for the BT version my copy of this KB has a very stiff inflexible USB cable. If I move the keyboard the cable bunches up lifts up and pushes things around on my desk. At first I thought the cable would relax over time but - no love so far. The blue power on LED is irritatingly bright I ended up covering it up. Other than these minor issues the KB is working great, very portable with no other issues.UPDATE: March 26 2023 - I have to report that this keyboard after about 3 months use has certain keys that have become intermittent. In particular the \"e\" key which is increasingly unreliable. So much so I am no longer able to use the KB with my iMac. Yes other KB's work fine with the iMac. I am reducing my rating from a 3 starts to a one star. I tried the KB on my PC and it has the same problem. I like that the KB has a small foot print but the stiff cable and now unreliable keys make it impossible to use. I would not recommend this KB if you looking for something that will last.UPDATE: April 6, 2023I noticed that this KB still qualified for a warranty replacement so I requested one. Have to say that Macally stood behind their product and mailed me an exact same model KB free of charge. Also, the USB cable is improved, more flexible and less stiff than my first copy of this KB. As far as longevity goes only time will tell. I still enjoy he space saving quality of this KB as well as the look and tactile feel of the keys. Raising my rating to 3 - Hope it lasts.",
