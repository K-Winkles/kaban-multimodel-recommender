                "reviewText": "When I saw this wireless keyboard and mouse that promised to \"combine the perfect blend of vintage industrial aesthetics with a modern wireless keyboard,\" I HAD to have it. I write using a laptop with a damaged keyboard and had struggled with a missing letter for some time. This keyboard was the answer, I was sure of it. I was thrilled when I received the keyboard set.Sadly, the USB receiver was not in the box. I emailed customer service, and was asked to look again. I did so and let them know that I did not find it, just as I knew I would not. I provided my address upon request, as well as my order number. I was then asked to look one more time, and later asked to confirm my address again. Eventually, they agreed to send me a replacement. The whole process of checking, confirming, and promising took about five days. On January 10 I was told that the replacement would arrive in 3-7 business days. I finally received it on January 20.Now that I have it, I am quite pleased with the keyboard and mouse. They are made of a lightweight plastic, and they keys stand out much like a typewriter. They make a clicking sound when I type, which is kind of fun and nostalgic for me, as I was a Secretary for many, many years. The color is fun and makes me happy. The mouse and keyboard work together with one USB receiver. Costwise, this set is a bit pricey, as it is higher than many standard sets. It is less expensive than some high-end or gamer keyboard and mouse combinations.",

So of course my cursor goes to random places and it really messes with my flow. So I decided to get a Bluetooth keyboard. I love the color and the raised keys so it can tell you aren\u2019t accidentally hitting two keys at once. It gives off the whole typewriter vibe with the keys. While it doesn\u2019t clack like a typewriter the jets do make a pleasant clicking sound when pressed. It comes with a matching mouse to keep the color vibe consistent.",

                "reviewText": "I've used both gaming and mechanical keyboards, not the highest end but higher than average so this was a change. I think the average keyboard user will be happy with it and if you need a backup keyboard or want to try out round keys then it does the job.Not too loud and doesn't take much pressure to press the keys. They feel faintly gummy and while I can't tell if they actually wobble they leave a sensation of a little jitter back and forth as I'm typing. The mouse clicks are also a little gummy but more in a soft way that I like. Keeps it quiet which is great!Battery powered is a plus for traveling but keep in mind if you want to use this with a phone or tablet you'll need a USB-A converter to whatever type of input your device uses.",
