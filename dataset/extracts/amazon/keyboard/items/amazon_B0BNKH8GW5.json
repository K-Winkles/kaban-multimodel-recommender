                "reviewText": "If you have been in the market for a good mechanical keyboard, then you know how pricey they can be, especially if you are pretty specific about it's options. I will start with my one negative about the Keychron K6, if you are looking for very clicky tactile keys, their blue switches are not the best I have experienced. They definitely have a click and some resistance, however they seem to be lacking, ever so slightly, the blue feel. When you know you know.Now, that being said, there are many positives to this keyboard. First, the bluetooth connectivity is pretty simple and I have not experienced any delay or mistype whatsoever. It may take a second to connect once I wake up my computer, but the lag is really nothing to complain about.Second, the RGB functionality is pretty on par with even the best out there. As far as customization, this might be where spending a little extra will get your further, but the pre programmed features are pretty vast and most people will be able to find something suitable to their tastes. From solid colours, to breathing effects, you will be covered.The keys themselves are transparent, so the RBG lighting can be subtle, however, you have the ability to switch out the keycaps if this is a real concern for you. I myself, opted to add some pudding keycaps, which really help the lighting on the keyboard pop. There are also both Mac and Window keycaps included for whichever platform you need it for. I truly appreciate that I can use this keyboard with my MacBook and not have to worry too much about finding the right keys for the task, an issue on other non Mac specific keyboards.The keyboard comes with a braided USB C to USB wire, which has a solid and durable feel. I am not really worried about the cord wearing down anytime soon. And finally, this is a fairly compact keyboard, that does not sacrifice too much. There are no dedicated function keys, however there are dedicated arrow keys, which I find I use and actually need. There are also was to customize the functions of certain keys, for example, I have made one of my keys a dedicated screen shot key.Overall, this has a very sturdy build and a little heft, might be a small issue for portability, however this keyboard was well worth the money I paid for it. Minor tweaks I would do here and there, but I seriously doubt you will be disappointed with this purchase. Just keep in mind what you want in a keyboard and check to see that it will meet those needs. If not, Keychron has some good alternatives out there, and judging by the quality of this keyboard, they would be worth a buy as well.",

                "reviewText": "I received a new MBP for Christmas and it is outstanding. However, I am not crazy about the keyboard (or any laptop keyboard for that matter) and purchased the K6 with Gateron \"blue\" switches. There are many things I quite enjoy about this keyboard and a couple things that leave a bit to be desired.The things I like are this keyboard is rock solid and hefty. With the aluminum rails and the 4000 mAH battery this keyboard is sturdy. When typing, it feels very good to me and I enjoy the crisp sound of the \"blue\" switches. To me, this is what a keyboard should feel like. Switches, located on the left side of the keyboard, allow the user to switch operating systems or connectivity preference. A LED located next to the type 'C' USB port glows red during battery charging or green when charged.Since I am a Mac user, I appreciate the 'Mac-centric' keys on the bottom row and the the top row. Legends on the top row are also familiar to Mac users, however, there lies a problem.The Mac legends on the top row are not illuminated and are difficult to discern regardless of the lighting situation. Also, for such a great keyboard I think better keycaps could have been included. The caps included feel thin and do not allow key lighting through well. For this reason I am looking for a new set of keycaps to replace the ones that came on the board.The K6 looks good, feels very good and is probably one of the best after market accessories a person could purchase for use with their Mac, that is, except for the keycaps. I most definitely would recommend this keyboard.",
