                "reviewText": "I was looking for a Bluetooth keyboard to use with my phone and tablet and decided to try this one. I\u2019m really glad I did! The keyboard is slightly smaller than a standard keyboard but it is still super comfortable to use. I like having a full number pad on the side as that is missing on my laptop and I prefer to do numbers on a keypad. The keyboard folds compactly and is stored in this really nice case that also has a pocket on the back for a stand that will hold a phone or tablet comfortably. There is an included USB-A to USB-C cable to easily charge the keyboard but the battery life is really good so you won\u2019t have to charge it often. There are three channels you can choose as well so you can easily switch between devices that you\u2019ve connected to the keyboard. Connecting the Bluetooth keyboard was super easy even without reading the directions. All in all, this is a great little keyboard that will definitely be traveling with me wherever I go!",

                "reviewText": "It is not very often that I get a product that far exceeds my expectations. Well, this one sure does!I needed a portable keyboard. I do a lot of typing on my phone on the road and to be honest I am no expert at typing with the phone's keyboard. I have always thought it would be nice to have a larger keyboard that would attach wirelessly to my phone but the ones I have seen are cheap and do not feel good when you type.I saw this foldable, compact, Bluetooth keyboard that is rechargeable and it seemed to have everything I would want in a portable keyboard.The keyboard arrived in some of the nicest packaging I have ever seen on any piece of electronics I have purchased.This would make for a great gift but always makes you feel good when you open up a package where the manufacturer has obviously put a lot of pride and thought into the packaging. It gives you confidence that the manufacturer has also put as much thought into the product, and they have.You first open the external box with all the printing on it. Inside is a mainly black box that opens to reveal the contents.The package comes with the tri-fold keyboard, a USB-C charging cable, a nice case with a classy magnetic clasp, a user manual, a warranty card, and what appears to be a greeting card that includes information about the manufacturer.The case comes with a small pocket in the back and inside of that is a small stand for holding your smartphone while you type. Very ingenious.The keyboard is trifold, opens up easily, and is very solid once open.Pairing with your smart device is very simple. You enter your Bluetooth pairing mode on your phone and it finds the keyboard immediately.Once paired it works flawlessly.I am used to typing on a small laptop and this keyboard felt just as good as my laptop keyboard.All the typing is instantaneous with no lag at all.The little stand that they include with this package holds my Samsung Flip phone perfectly and can be adjusted to different angles.When done the keyboard folds up nicely and is very small.I am very impressed with this keyboard. It has far exceeded my expectations and is better than any other portable keyboard I have tried before.For the price, this is a steal! It's great value for your money and if you are looking for a portable keyboard then stop looking! I highly recommend this one.",

I was looking for a way to type with my phone, but prefer having the number pad on my keyboard, so this is perfect!The keyboard comes with a case, phone stand, Quick Start Guide (for Bluetooth connection), User Manual, USB-C to USB-A charging cord (no AC adapter) and a thank you envelope with support information and catalogue of other products.The Bluetooth connection is \"ProtoArc XK01 Mini\" and there are 3 function buttons on the keyboard to connect. I paired with Bluetooth on my phone then pressed Fn-Q and it came up with the \"Pair Device\" prompt on my phone. It was easy to connect.The keyboard itself is well-built and the hinges feel like metal. It was nice they added the phone stand to the set as you usually need one while using a keyboard to type. The phone stand folds nicely into the back pocket of the case.At first I didn't like the snap to close the case, but then realized it is magnetic and snaps itself into place without any force.The case with the keyboard and phone stand inside weighs about 267g and is about 8.25\" x 4.75\" x 1 1/8\" (21 cm x 12.1 cm x 2.7 cm). The keyboard itself weighs 209g and is about 12 7/8\" long x 3 3/4\" wide x 1/4\"-7/16\" thick (32.6 cm x 9.7 cm x 0.5-1.2cm thick). The keyboard when folded is about 7 3/16\" x 3 3/4\" x 1/2\" (18.3 cm x 9.5 cm x 1.5 cm). The phone stand weighs about 25g and is about 3.25\" x 2 13/16\" x 1/4\"-7/16\" thick (8.3 cm x 7.1 cm x 0.5-1 cm thick).The keypad on this folding keyboard is just slightly smaller than a regular keyboard. From Q to P is about 6.75\" (17.3 cm) and on my regular keyboard this span is about 7 1/4\" (18.5 cm). The height from T to V is about 1 15/16\" (4.8 cm) on this keyboard, whereas it's about 2 1/8\" (5.4 cm) on my regular keyboard.Overall, I'm happy with the size, portability, and durability of this keyboard.",

                "reviewText": "I'm genuinely almost shocked with how good this product is.First, I'll start by saying that the packaging and presentation is really top notch. I know for many people this may be far less important than functionality, but it does help instill confidence in the quality of the product. The box itself feels rather premium with a very nice feeling, smooth cardboard. Even the insert inside is the same, high quality feelings packaging. There's even a nice envelope inside (also high quality) with a note from the lead of the company, talking about the product and business.Then on to the keyboard itself. It connected via bluetooth seamlessly for me, the keys felt great, and were very responsive. Basically everything you could hope for in a keyboard. That would be enough there for basic usage. But there's more to love.Despite being very compact, there's even multimedia keys (play/pause, fast forward, etc. accessible via the Fn button), 3 separate bluetooth connections (for seamless connection to 3 different devices) and there's even a little separate collapsible stand to hold a mobile device, like a phone or tablet on the table in front of you.On top of all of this, it even comes with a nice little carrying case that holds both the keyboard and the stand.The keyboard itself feels nice to use, as I mentioned, but it also feels durable. The hinges don't feel too fragile at all, and in fact, while somewhat hard to describe, the hinges have a sliding piece of plastic that covered the hinge once extended, to add some extra rigidity to the device while open. This hinge support doesn't require any work from the user though. They automatically slide into place as you open/unfold the keyboard. A very nice touch!Really, just having a keyboard that had nice feeling and responsive buttons would be enough. But all the additional things I mention above really make this feel like it's in another class of it's own. It's really incredible how compact and portable, yet truly functional it feels. I rarely write this much in a review, but I really can't recommend this enough.",

While it keeps the device lightweight and portable, a slightly more robust build material could enhance the overall durability and feel of the keyboard. \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f\ud83d\udd04\ud83d\udd04\ud83d\udd0dThe ProtoArc XK01 Bluetooth Keyboard has become an indispensable part of my mobile workspace.
