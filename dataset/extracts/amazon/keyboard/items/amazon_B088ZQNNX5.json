                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Ultra Slim Bluetooth Keyboard, and I must say it has exceeded my expectations. This keyboard has turned my son\u2019s ipad into a laptop and enabled me to actually get some work done while he is doing his homework.Key Features:*Quiet - the keys don\u2019t clack loudly, which is great for using in public places*Slim profile - perfect for tablets*Great connectivity - don\u2019t have to worry about wires and stays connected via bluetoothQuality:The build quality is nothing extraordinary, but it feels solid for how little I paid for it. It is pretty thin, which is a positive and something I wanted, but also means it does have a flimsy feel. However, I\u2019m not worried that my teenage son will be carrying it around and using it for school. I think it will hold up just fine.Performance:I am thoroughly impressed with its performance. So far it has not lost connectivity and I haven\u2019t had to charge it yet, which means it has held it\u2019s charge for over a week of use.Design:My son loves the sleek design. It\u2019s so thin, thinner than I realized through the item description. The colorful keys is a nice touch and adds a bit of personality. It\u2019s also just wide enough for an ipad, but the keys still feel comfortable\u2014there\u2019s enough space between the keys to make typing feel natural.Ease of Use:One of the standout features is how user-friendly it is. Even for someone like my son who is not tech-savvy, this Ultra Slim Bluetooth Keyboard was easy to set up and use right out of the box.Value for Money:Considering the quality, performance, and design, this bluetooth keyboard offers exceptional value for money. It was so cheap I was afraid it would not last long, but after using it for awhile, I feel confident it will serve us well.Conclusion:In conclusion, I highly recommend the Ultra Slim Bluetooth Keyboard to anyone looking for a reliable, high-quality, small bluetooth keyboard.",

                "reviewText": "First I want to add that the typing experience is not expected to be perfect, and attempting to compare it to a standard keyboard is a horrible approach.I connected it to my iPad Mini 6 and it was instantly picked up, and there is no lag in the time between typing a character and it showing on screen. When my on screen keyboard showed up I expected a conflict, but the first letter I typed the on screen went away. I have two hands filled with thumbs, so I was not expecting it to be a casual typing experience, and I was not wrong. If you type home-row you will struggle, but if you hunt and peck, you won't notice a difference in your experience.The solid metal back was a pleasant surprise, and that gives the very thin keyboard nice rigidity. The keys are smaller than Chiclets, but clearly labeled, and look to be durable.For $11, if you're trying to build a small travel platform, this is both budget friendly, compact and usable. So far a high recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great little keyboard with easy connectivity and great battery life. My complaints:1) I did have to add sticky feet to keep it from sliding around. Not a big deal.2) The USB port is micro-USB, not USB-C. Not a big deal but unfortunate.3) My main complaint is that the bottom left CTRL and FN keys are swapped relative to what I could consider typical. In fact, their order is the same as the layout that Lenovo uses and Lonovo has an option in their BIOS to switch them. I would love it if there were some sort of switch to swap them on this keyboard. Since I use the CTRL key a LOT and can't unlearn that muscle memory, I can't use this keyboard and had to choose a comparable one on Amazon which, by the way, has rubber feet and USB C, but the keys require too much pressure, making mistyping an issue for me.Summary, if you don't care about the CTRL/FN key layout, this is a GREAT keyboard.",

                "reviewText": "I needed something I could take to cafes to work on, and my 11+ year old laptop wasn\u2019t going to cut it. I then looked at small portable laptops, tablets, etc. but the price tags weren\u2019t worth it. Finally, I looked up Bluetooth keyboards so I could work on my phone and found this. This keyboard is a game changer! It works wonderfully and I haven\u2019t had any issues with connectivity. I debated between the 7 and 10 inch keyboard and ultimately decided on the 10 which, for me, I think was the right call. It\u2019s slim and fits in my purse just fine.",

Keys are just sticky and you gotta back space a few times to correct any mistakes but it lasts a long time as long as you charge equally long. If you don\u2019t mind sticky keys then I\u2019d recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a small keyboard to use with my tablet when I travel. Of them all, this was the right size and price.Battery Life: I do not use this keyboard for long periods of time, but have found that it holds it charge. I used it several times when I was camping for 4-5 days and did not have to recharge it while I was gone. I charge it overnight when I may need it and it holds the charge.Connectivity: I have only used the keyboard with my tablet, but it was easy to set up using the bluetooth connection.Size: This is a SMALL keyboard. Be aware it is the size as described. It is just what I need and travels well. It does take a little typing to get used to how small it is, but after a few minutes, you get used to it.Use Experience: When using, make sure you have the keyboard on a solid, flat surface. The keyboard is thin and it feels more sturdy to do this. The keyboard is sensitive, so if the surface you use is not sturdy, the keyboard may bounce a bit - causing extra keystrokes. When traveling, I put the keyboard in a protective sleeve and pack it between items slightly larger so there is no risk of it breaking. Again - I knew the size and thinness of the keyboard before ordering so this is not a problem for me.I don't use this keyboard for everyday use, just for short spurts at home or when traveling. I recommend this for anyone looking for a keyboard for travel, but is not doing a huge amount of typing. It is perfect for my needs and am very happy with this purchase.",
