It arrived in the original box; though the outside packaging was a bit damaged, the keyboard was still wrapped and looked completely untouched to me. Some background: college CS student, gamer, ~100wpm if it means anything. Have been using this keyboard (my first mechanical one) for 3 months now.Pros:- RBG lighting - no clunky software needed, various options all controlled via the F keys. I really didn't think I'd enjoy the lighting but have definitely grown to appreciate it.- Great for gaming - keys are very responsive and I do think it makes a difference (coming from a regular membrane keyboard)- Seems study/durable - basically no signs of wear and tear after 3 months (though I have been doing my best to keep it in good condition on my part)- Price - I paid $40 for what was essentially a new $100 keyboardCons:- The cherry viola switches are kind of loud, the spacebar in particular - haven't gotten complaints when using Discord or Zoom (since they have good background noise filtering), but it's definitely very audible in-person if you're not being careful- Not hot-swappable- Rather sensitive keys; I find myself accidentally typing the same key twice or more sometimes (but you do get used to it)Other:- Keys come off quite easily, you don't even really need to use a keycap puller - could be good or bad? It was convenient for me when I was putting o-rings on my keys to make them a little quieter. I haven't pulled any off accidentally, but I'd be careful when handling/moving it around.Overall, for ~$40 - an amazing deal. I still see \"used - like new\" options for <40, so I'd definitely recommend picking it up!",

                "reviewText": "So coming from my favorite keyboards, scissors and low profile membrane, my first try on another mechanical gaming keyboard was disappointing. The key travel was very long, the keys were super springy, and it felt like typing on a trampoline. I hated it, and almost just gave up trying to make one work. That is where this keyboard comes in.I love the short key travel, the low profile keys, and how it feels. Gaming on it is now effortless and feels totally natural. I'm getting more control than I had on membrane while keeping the great feel. Takes a little getting used to, because the keys are sensitive so when you first start out you will likely get some mistyped keys, but that fades quickly. Once you get used to it, you can almost float your fingers on it without bottoming it out. I use this on the couch in my lap, and it is perfect for what I need it for.The RGB is very nice. Bright, and so much customization. Sky is the limit here, so you can get very creative. No complaints here at all.I did get a \"used - very good\" version first, which was not very good but was indeed damaged, likely a factory defect. The deck was dented and some keys were cracked without any other signs of damage, not something someone could do on their own. Returned and got a brand new one, and all is well.In summary, if you like short key travel sensitive keyboards with a great feel, you will like this. Price was great too ;)",

                "reviewText": "Update after a month of use for typing and programming:When it comes to typing and other textual documentation, I like the the apple keyboard since, that's much faster as there is little movement of fingers required.However when it comes to coding, since one would be pressing multiple (combination keys) at once, a lot; mac keyboard fails here as it's hard to hit the keys right without looking at the keyboard. Membrane keyboards are better but the mechanical keyboards are the best since one can feel the keys before accidentally hitting them.I liked the brown keys keyboard that I used earlier, the good this with this particular K60 from Corsair is, it's a lot silent than the cherry mx keys, so I can enjoy my music playing on the desktop speakers while typing.Only thing that I didn't like that much on this keyboard is, the actuation distance is very short, like 1mm, which is apt for gaming for typing, when I rest keys, I need to ensure that I don't press the keys accidentally (there is not tactile for actuation). I kind of got used to it.Below is the recommendation:Not recommended if you- like clicky sound- use this for typing AND have heavy handsRecommended if you- like more silent keyboard (as silent as a membrane keyboard)- quick actuation (gaming/ arrow key navigation etc)- for coding and do not have heavy fingers (so you avoid accidental actuation)- for typing and do not have heavy fingers- like funky full-color back lights (this keyboard has best back-lighting)The space-bar was noisy, I noticed this is happening at the time of releasing the key fast, the momentum of the space bar hitting the pasting limiter/stoppers on the top. I fixed it by pasting some petroleum jelly between the metal supporters and plastic groves/limiter that are on the either ends of the space-bars, and not to the mechanical transparent switch. Now the space bar is as pleasant as the \"enter\" key.Hardening silicone gel is another option, but I couldn't locate that on time. If you use silicone, you need to be super precise with it as you don't want to obstruct the motion of the keys with hardened silicone.I am getting one more of K60 RGB Pro SE for my 5th grader daughter, cuz I like this keyboard for my needs and she likes it too bumping up to 5 star.I can provide pictures.------------------Update after a week of heavy use:This *sounds* more pleasing than the brown keys. Keys still feel harder to bottom out (I know keys don't change but I can get used to it). The actuation point is roughly at 1mm, so there is no need to bottom out the keys except for a sense of satisfaction.Still keeping 4 stars. Would upgrade to 5 stars when/if this becomes my go to keyboard and when I start recommending to my friends. Currently I still recommend a keyboard with \"brown keys\" for typing use.Original Review:Cherry MV (MX Viola) Keys (transparent ones) - not blue, brown, red. Feels like a variant of MX Red. Should be better than MX Red when it comes to gaming.This keyboard was a total surprise to me, in a good way and a bad way both.Softer than expected.Heavier than expected.Colors look cooler than expected.Space bar more wiggly and noisy than expected.Quality of material, better than expected.Ergo - rather a flat keyboard - not as expected.Wrist pad --- integrated magnetic wrist pad is better than an independent one.Hopefully I will get used to it soon.This is a next level of engineering, I don't know if the effect is good or bad, so far so go. Will update the review after a few 1000s of lines of code.",

Las teclas suenan muy suaves, son sensibles al tacto pero nada que resulte estresante, al contrario del todo es buen\u00edsimo tanto para jugar como para hacer ediciones de video y foto, muy pr\u00e1ctico.LO QUE NO ME GUSTOA pesar de que el teclado es bueno, lo \u00fanico que no me agrado es el software de ICUE me dio problemas con mi computadora a la hora de personalizar el teclado, buscando en Internet encontr\u00e9 que es fallo de una actualizaci\u00f3n que sufri\u00f3 el software, SIN EMBARGO, puedes hacer uso y alternas entre los modos de disparo de luz sin necesidad del programa, lo cual es una maravilla, solo llegas, conectas y listo, el teclado responde sin ning\u00fan problema",
