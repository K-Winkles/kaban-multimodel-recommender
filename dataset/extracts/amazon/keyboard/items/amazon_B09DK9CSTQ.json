The lights are cool and when you press the FN key with any of the other keys next to the number pad, you can change the pattern of the lights. Coolest thing ever, and the keys are raised so it's easier to type. Makes a sharp clickety-clack sound, almost like an old fashioned typewriter when you type, love it! I debated whether or not to order this keyboard but it turned out to be a great decision, haha!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is beyond why I was expecting. I was skeptical about getting the typical white with the blue light that is all over Amazon, and didn\u2019t want an assortment of colors either. When I saw this gold light I knew it was the one. When I opened the box which was well packaged, it was prettier than I expected. The keys are all in a rose gold casing and they have the most amazing clicking sound to them. Far better than my previous typewriter keyboard set. This looks and feels expensive before plugging in. Once unplugged it in all the lights danced around and then I played with the light options a bit. You\u2019ll see the lights flashing in the video- it\u2019s due to recording it, and does not do that to the naked eye. The gold light is perfect and gives that warm vibe versus the cold blue lights I\u2019ve been seeing on other keyboards. Great buy, highly recommend to jazz up your desk and workspace.",

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 3 is because my first one stopped working correctly after just less than a year. Also, my second one came with several of the keys unattached. It was easy to pop them back on though. If this one goes out, I will be repurchasing again. That's how much I love it!",
