                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Great value for my money. At first I was worried the keys were to close together but it\u2019s actually perfect. The keys are soft and very quiet to type with. There are 3 brightness settings. I work from home and the first 2 hours the sun is still down and I\u2019d prefer not to turn the light on that early so I bought this keyboard for the backlight. It\u2019s very pleasing to the eyes and the mouse that comes with it is smooth and quiet clicks as well. I enjoy the design of this keyboard it\u2019s not super basic and it\u2019s a very sturdy hardware.UPDATEI\u2019ve had this set for 2 months and I still love it very much. I love the key strokes and the colors and feel of this set just so much. However the keys are starting to wipe away which takes away from the look of the keyboard and makes it look worn out. This keyboard has such a great look to it that it\u2019s very saddening that the keys are wiping away so easily. Almost as if it was constructed cheaply. I rarely use the N key as I don\u2019t have any passwords or commonly used words in my job that require the letter N. My R, D, C, and O keys are also starting to fade away. This is the biggest downfall I have experienced with this set which is a pretty hard fall. The battery last a very long time and I only have to charge it maybe every week and half. Nothing earlier or sooner than that. It is a great value for your money but by the way the keys are disappearing I won\u2019t have this set for very long. Highly disappointed in this.",
