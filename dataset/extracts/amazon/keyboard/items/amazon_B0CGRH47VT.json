The phone holder is super useful and holds my phone(galaxy s23) and my partners(galaxy z fold). It did take a few days for the keys to loosen up as we live in a very cold area but now that it's been hooked up for a few days the keys are super soft and smooth when typing. I love that the product has a auto sleep function so I don't waste batteries.You do need two different types of batteries which is annoying but not a deal breaker. The keyboard does feel super light when you open the box and feels rather like a toy versus an actual keyboard but it works great. I also love the mouse, it has a super satisfying click. Honestly for the price, quality and design im over the moon. It makes working more enjoyable.",

My old mouse finally bit the dust and I decided to go wireless again and went for the matching set. Love that they are connected to a single USB connection. Both are so quiet...amazing. truly plug and play....I pulled it all out of the box, added the batteries, plugged in the USB, turned devices on and went on with my work. love that it was so seamless.",

However, personally, I absolutely love the sound of a keyboard and bought this specifically because I thought it was going to sound like my last one that looked just like it. Nowhere in the description does it say silent keys and yet I get them. It feels like there's something sticky under my keys all the time because of the silencing of it. Looks great but I hate it. I miss the dopamine the sounds of the keys gave me.",
