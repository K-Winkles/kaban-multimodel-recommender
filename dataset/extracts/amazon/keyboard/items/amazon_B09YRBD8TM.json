                "reviewText": "Have owned this keyboard for a few months now and I must say its superior to many other keyboards I have had in the past. The RGB light still is functioning, the clicks are quiet enough that I don't hear them and none of the keys have worn out. Partially it could be in such good shape as I clean it often and is good maintenance for any keyboard.The only con is some of the lettering does get scratched pretty easily but I believe that more user error than defect or faulty issue. Definitely recommend this keyboard for gaming as well as office work. Love the backlights as I can switch them off but I rarely do. Will update if anything changes. 5/5!",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a keyboard that looked cool, was comfortable, and had the separate numeric keypad. This one checks all those boxes. My laptop keyboard is very clumsy for my fingers and I often have trouble typing. I thought this keyboard could improve that, and it does. The keys are easy to find and press and the response is great. One thing I notice is that the color scheme seems to continually reset to standard on rather than the strobe setting I like. Not sure if that is from me hitting the programming key or if there is a timeout on the strobe setting. I have nothing bad to say about the keyboard; it just didn't blow me away as much as I thought it would. I give it a B+.",

I still love the keyboard for the feel, sound and lights but very disappointed that this is happening, I will have to replace in less than a year. I give it another few months before the keys have nothing left on them. Down grading my review because of this.Original Review - I bought this to replace a mechanical keyboard. I thought I was going to like the mechanical clicking and I was wrong. It was just too loud for me. Now this keyboard is so much more quiet. I love the soft touch and click of the keys. I can also type faster on this than I could on the mechanical one. The keys are very responsive. I wish it had more color changing options like the mechanical one I had but it is still pretty to look at. I bought this for work and so far so good. I am very happy with the cost and the quality of this keyboard.",
