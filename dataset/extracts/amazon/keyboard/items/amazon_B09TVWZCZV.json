I'm a bit bummed about the mouse failing but I put a lot of stock in great customer service and this company does it well! 5 stars******This set has the makings of a great keyboard/mouse combo. It's easy to type on, small and portable, and the colors are fun. I also love that it's rechargeable (but I hate that there is no warning as to when the battery will die. Your mouse or keyboard just literally stops working and you pray it's at a time when you can easily charge it).But unfortunately after 3 months the mouse totally stopped working. I charged it (lights on), but when I unplug the USB-C, the lights go off and it's unresponsive. I only have one USB port in my laptop so I can't just replace the mouse with another one.Back to the drawing board.",

                "reviewText": "Update: Returned for exchange and the 2nd mouse was still wonky.. The keyboard does not hold a charge for very long. It has to be plugged in every couple days. I'm assuming it's the lighting effect that uses up all the power because my last keyboard was a Jellycomb and it stayed charged for at least a month at a time. Also VERY THIN black color on the keys. Within the first month of use my keys have noticeable wear and white spots from the black wearing off.I really do love both the keyboard and the mouse. Love the colors available, the 3 dim/brightness settings, and the sleep mode if I am not using it for a few minutes. The keyboard especially has very smooth keys and the touch is perfect, you don't have to slam on the keys for it to take the keystrokes.The only issue is the mouse is a bit wonky. It (the cursor pointer) has a tendency to take off across the screen even though I'm not touching the mouse. And it does not always go where I want it to, when I am touching it. For instance, I will try to hover on a certain cell in a spreadsheet and the pointer moves just a little bit on it's own, so it makes it very hard to select on screen items if they are very small or very specific.Had I not purchased this as an emergency (6 hour delivery with Prime) because my previous wireless keyboard/mouse combo quit working (the mouse did) I would probably try to exchange it but I'm worried the next mouse might be the same. So, I don't know.. I may try a different set and return this one.",

                "reviewText": "I was excited when I first received the keyboard & mouse. I wanted to give them a good try before I wrote my review. It has been over a month now. I love the keyboard backlight. I keep mine on purple. I like that the mouse has a silent click. If you are working in a quiet area you will not hear a peep from the mouse. But, I have an issue with the mouse. The changing of colors is nice. However, it stops working from time to time, even after I have woken it up from sleep mode. The mouse will move, meaning I can still see it on my screen, but I am not able to click anything or scroll through the page. I've tried to deal with it, but it keeps happening all too often. I think it's a mechanical issue. I hope the seller will see this and send out a new mouse.Update: The seller contacted me immediately after this review went up. They promptly sent out a brand new mouse and keyboard. I\u2019ve had it for a few days now and I no longer have any mouse issues. This new mouse works pristinely. I would like to thank the seller for the wonderful customer service. Y\u2019all earned these 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the \"Wireless Keyboard and Mouse\" combo by SABLUTE from Amazon, and I must say, there are both positives and negatives to this product.Let's start with the positives. The keyboard has a sleek and slim design, and the 7 backlit effects add a nice touch, especially in low-light settings. The inclusion of a phone holder is a thoughtful addition, making it convenient to keep my phone within reach while I work. The quiet light-up keys are a bonus, ensuring a pleasant typing experience without disturbing others around me. The Type C adapter compatibility is a great feature, making it versatile for use with Mac, PC, and laptops. The rechargeable feature is eco-friendly and saves me from constantly replacing batteries.However, there are a couple of issues that need addressing. Firstly, the mouse lags persistently, even when it's fully charged. This lag can be quite frustrating and hampers my productivity. I tried troubleshooting and checking for interference, but the problem seems to persist. This issue needs immediate attention, as it affects the overall usability of the product.Secondly, the keyboard's battery life leaves much to be desired. Despite being fully charged, the battery dies after just two days of moderate usage. This is quite disappointing as I expected the rechargeable feature to offer longer-lasting power.Another significant concern is the lack of response from the seller when trying to address these issues. I reached out multiple times, but they never responded to my messages. This lack of customer support adds to the overall disappointment with the product.I really want to love this combo, as the design and other features are impressive. However, the mouse lag, short keyboard battery life, and the absence of responsive customer support are significant drawbacks that cannot be overlooked.In conclusion, the SABLUTE Wireless Keyboard and Mouse combo has great potential, but the issues with the mouse lag and short keyboard battery life need to be addressed by the manufacturer. Additionally, improved customer support is essential to assist customers facing problems. Until these problems are resolved, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this product to others.",
