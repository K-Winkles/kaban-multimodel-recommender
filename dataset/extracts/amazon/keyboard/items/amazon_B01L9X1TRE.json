                "reviewText": "My first mechanical keyboard with modern switches (instead of the older buckling-spring assemblies) was a Velocifire VM01. It served me well, but I decided recently to splurge and go for a more premium deck \u2013 in this case the Das Keyboard Prime 13 with Cherry MX Brown keyswitches. It does, I must admit, have a very different feel to my significantly cheaper VM01 Keyboard. It\u2019s not unpleasant. The switches feel very similar to the way my old Unicomp Model M buckling spring keyboard felt. There\u2019s a very satisfying buoyancy to the keys (for lack of a better word). It\u2019s a genuine joy to type on. I look forward to using this keyboard for National Novel Writing Month.The backlighting is even and strong \u2013 much more so than the VM01. The steel faceplate is cool to the touch and very solid. There\u2019s no noticeable flex, even when I press very hard down on the center of the keyboard or pick it up and twist the corners away from each other.The keycaps feel nice, have a clear and professional-looking font to them, and have very little wiggle which is a nice change from my VM01. That\u2019s a difference that $75 will get you. I may still need to put O-ring dampeners on the keys. We\u2019ll see how loud the keyboard actually sounds once I get it set up in my office.I don\u2019t notice the audible \u201cPING!\u201d when releasing larger keys such as the space bar and backspace buttons that annoyed me with the VM01. That\u2019s a level of quality I expected \u2013 but it\u2019s nice to see that my trust in the Das company wasn\u2019t unfounded. This is definitely one of the nicest premium keyboards I\u2019ve ever used \u2013 if not the best period.One very minor criticism \u2013 on keys that have two legends on them (like the number/symbol keys along the top and the bracket/curly brace keys on the side) the backlight only illuminates the top symbol and not the bottom. This is probably due to the fact that Cherry switches have their LED on the top of the switch\u2026but it would have been nice to have both light up still.I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just my unfamiliarity with the Cherry MX Brown switches, but I notice myself adding a lot of extra spaces in my writing. I\u2019ll have to see if that goes away with more regular use. It could be that the space bar on my old Velocifire VM01 was just less sensitive and I\u2019m used to really banging it to get it to actuate. Haha. The large buttons on this keyboard do require what seems like a lot less pressure to register than I\u2019m used to on the VM01. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s real or imagined.Although I was assured when I bought the VM01 that the OUTEMU off-brand brown switches were comparable to Cherry MX Browns \u2013 I\u2019m going to have to disagree. There\u2019s a decidedly different feel to these branded Cherries on the Das. Again, this may just be confirmation bias since I paid almost twice as much for this keyboard as the VM01 \u2013 but I feel like the Cherry switches are just smoother, and require less actuation force.This is the closest feel I\u2019ve found in a post-Model-M keyboard to the buckling spring monster I used back in the day. The keys pop back up in a satisfying and strong way. The sound is nice and clacky without being *completely* over the top. The overall look and feel of the keyboard itself is very high-end and professional looking. I see some of my coworkers bringing in high-end VGA keyboards and realize that the \u201cgamer\u201d aesthetic isn\u2019t really for me. I would feel juvenile using a board with multi-colored lights on it like some twenty-something\u2019s sports car.The cord is braided, which you\u2019ll either love or hate. I personally like the look and feel of it myself. It terminates in 2 USB 2.0 plugs \u2013 one for the keyboard and one for the USB pass-through port on the top right of the keyboard. I like to use this for my wireless mouse receiver. It\u2019s discreet and keeps it out of my way.This was my first purchase from Das, and I don\u2019t believe it will be the last. It took me a long time to be able to justify the price to myself but now that I\u2019ve used it first hand I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll be willing to go back to squishy ten dollar membrane keyboards again. Das may well have ruined me for them.",

                "reviewText": "Updated 2021.08.09, see notes at bottom!A nice functioning and overall sturdy basic keyboard.This is my second DAS mechanical keyboard, and fourth/fifth mechanical keyboard purchase. This is my first lit key cap keyboard, as I'm typically frightened by distractor' such as overly bright or flashing LED lights.PROS1) Nice soft (brown) key switch actuation, noticeably softer than the blue key switches. (I well notice I can type more characters in a day using the brown versus blue key switches.)3) No more gimmick magnetized ruler on the underside of the keyboard for elevating and angling the rear of the keyboard.4) No volume control knob, I rarely use as I and most other power users are connected to home stereo audio system via digital S/PDIF or HDMI cabling. The keyboard does have volume controls, using the FN key + Function keys. (Keyboard volume controls are likely intended for laptops and computers having all-in-one sound card with included amplifier.)5) Long USB cable. NOTE: This keyboard has two USB cables, one for the keyboard and the other for USB ports.CONS1) They reversed the positions of the shifted characters labeled on the key caps for the keyboard! Example, instead of the number one \"1\" on the bottom row of the key cap, the number one character is labeled on top with the exclamation mark on the bottom row. This key cap is entirely backwards and somewhat assume the engineers had to do so, in order to make the key cap lighting work? I sympathize with those just learning to type, and note the number pad are the only key caps not having this shifted lettering character anomaly or reversal.2) The key cap lighting does apparently have an adequate lowest lighting level setting, so that I'm not distracted by bright flickering LED lights. However at night or within dark rooms, the lowest LED lighting level is still too bright and does somewhat still flicker. I'm betting if the current lowest lighting level were halved or were a 50% level of the lowest current light setting, then the resulting light level would then be more than likely adequate for use within dark rooms or at night. But dimming LED lights tends to further induce flicker. Few LED lights are currently on the market with dimming features, while boasting stress free reading light. (Remember, the LED lighting around the keyboard is within the field of vision of the user while typing.)2) The shifted characters (eg. !, @, #, cursor number pad keys, ...) are not lit.3) Some different icons are used for key cap lettering, such as a double-ended arrow for the TAB key lettering, upward pointing arrow instead of CAPS LOCK lettering. If you're half blind and just learning how to touch type while looking at the keys, it might be a better system. But for children or those with eye sight, learning a keyboard will likely be far more easier seeing/reading \"Enter\", \"Caps Lock\", \"Shift\" on the key caps. The remainder of the less commonly utilized keys (eg. CTRL, INS, HOME, DEL, END, ...) are spelled-out, likely due to not having a common icon. I remember when the power icon first arrived within software several years ago, it took me several years to learn what the circle with slash really stood for as this power icon was rarely seen prior within software and far less likely hardware. One would rationally think, fewer and fewer non-typing older people with poor eye site will exist within future years, while commonly children typically see extremely well and are more apt to learn to type nowadays. Since I can type, this becomes a moot point, but if you're learning to type, you're likely going to want to study a keyboard layout with these keys spelled-out instead of attempting to comprehend these new icons.So far, the only time these reversed unshifted/shifted lettering and unusual icons become distracting, is when I look down at the keyboard rather than typing without looking. For a second, I'm stumped as this looks extremely odd, then I just switch to typing from memory rather than trying to discern what I am typing. (eg. \"Use the force Luke!\")2021.08.09: Still using this keyboard 4+ years after purchasing, and especially now after recently shopping around the past day or so trying to find a better typist specific typing keyboard. Nothing even comes close to this DAS keyboard, having a standard full-sized non-wireless/USB keyboard with gentle back-lighting. As of 2021, everything on the market is still not geared to the typing profession, but to playing games! My keyboard is primarily used on Linux based operating systems. Nothing has broken on this keyboard and has recently survived being washed in the bathtub after a milk-based drink spill into the key areas. Just wish they had a sensitive scissored key switch model, or something similar to an electronic typewriting experience!",

Me gusto que no parece \"nave extraterrestre\" y su apariencia es muy profesional. En cuanto al ruido ni hablar, si que es muy ruidoso no lo recomendar\u00eda si esto es un factor de alta importancia. En t\u00e9rminos generales, el precio justifica su calidad.",

                "reviewText": "This is the best mechanical keyboard on the market. I love the illuminated white lights, allows you to type easily in the pitch dark. The prime 13 is far better than the 4 professional since it comes equipped with rubber feet instead of that stupid useless ruler that would make your keyboard slide all over the place. The only downside I could think of is that it no longer comes with the volume knob, but that's not a real deal breaker for me cause I normally use my mouse to control the volume. I had issues with the 4 professional and that's why I upgraded to this model instead. I remember sometimes the blue led lights for the num lock wouldn't always work properly which was really annoying. The prime keyboard, on the other hand, works flawlessly. Feels fantastic while typing and you could use as much force when typing, the keys are super durable. It seems like you can't break this keyboard no matter how hard you type. It comes with a usb pass-through which is great if you have a wireless mouse, you simply attach the usb dongle to it and voila you save yourself a usb slot on your PC. Plus your wireless mouse works better since the usb dongle for your mouse if literally less than a foot away. Another downside to this keyboard, is that you require two usb slots for the keyboard to function properly since it comes equipped with two usb connectors. All in all, this is my favorite keyboard I've ever owned. Das has released a couple of newer keyboards recently and I think they look fantastic with ample functionalities. Das never ceases to amaze me. What a fantastic company.",
