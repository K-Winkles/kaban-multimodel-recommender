                "reviewText": "This keyboard looks great, takes up little room, has all the essential functions, and is plug-and-play (no software needed). On top of that, it is super cheap. I bought a $90 mechanical keyboard prior to this, but this keyboard seems just as responsive and is quieter and more comfortable. I love the large space bar, and honestly, I prefer membrane keyboards anyway.The only con to speak of is the squeaky spacebar, but that was easily fixed by taking the space bar off (used a paper clip to do this), applying some hair clipper oil to the metal bar underneath, and reattaching it.",
