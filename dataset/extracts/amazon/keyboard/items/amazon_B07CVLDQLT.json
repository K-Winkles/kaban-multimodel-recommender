                "reviewText": "This keyboard looks and feels good. The keys have a fairly short travel but I like the action very much. They have just the right amount of resistance for me.The keyboard is made of aluminum and is very nicely finished. The icing on the cake is useful function keys. There are keys that increase or decrease font size of web pages, keys that bring up the screen capture function, keys that increase or decrease monitor brightness, as well as the usual function keys that increase or decrease volume, etc.I also like the fact that it is a wired keyboard that plugs into a standard USB (type A) socket. I've had intermittency problems with wireless keyboards in the past, plus I'd rather not have to periodically charge my keyboard.I think that for the money this would be a hard keyboard to beat.

                "reviewText": "I have not had any problems with my Macally keyboard as few I have read. It is soft to the touch, larger sized keypads allowing me to type fast without slipping into the next key. No keys are sticking, and the typing is fluid. Interestingly, the two keys F and J have a slight edge to enable one to center their fingers quickly without looking, in the event you get off center. I'm very happy with this purchase. This and my matching Macally mouse arrived in less than three days. Priced very well on Amazon.",

                "reviewText": "Compared to the Apple keyboard, this one has added Fn keys to the left and right of the space bar row, resulting in a cramped control-option-command layout. It also features an absurdly large Fn key on the right (it's nearly the size of the return key). The keys themselves also have a textured finish and feel subjectively \"harder\" (surface hardness, not key press force) than the Apple keyboard. The function-lock and caps-lock indicators are bright and easily visible, as is the always-on power indicator. They would probably be visible outdoors at noon on a sunny day.That said, the movement feel is excellent, and very similar to Apple's keyboard. Other than the Fn keys, it's a fine alternative to a genuine Apple keyboard. They do offer other layouts that don't feature as many Fn keys, but all seem to have an extra special-use key on the right side of the space bar, and the other layouts feature different layouts/groupings of the function keys (F1-F16). There isn't a model that exactly duplicates Apple's layout, but I suspect there would be trademark/design issues involved in that.If you like Apple's keyboards, but don't want to pay their prices, I can't imagine you'd find a better alternative than this.",

You have no PrntScr key. But for this it is possible to use software, such as Greenshot.",

                "reviewText": "If you're a Mac user who uses a number of keyboard shortcuts, this is not the keyboard for you. The first impossible task I discovered in seconds was my inability to move between tabs in a browser, for which one uses command/option and the arrow keys. However, the brilliant designers at Macally interrupted the flow by adding a giant \"function\" key to the right of the control key and my hand cannot reach the arrow keys. I don't need a function key that often but I guess they thought this would attract PC users. In order to accommodate the function key on the right they shrunk both the width of the spacebar and the size of the command, control and option keys. All of which are normally larger than the letter keys.In the couple of days I've been using this I've been interrupted countless times by having hit the wrong key, usually the function, when I want the control. The designers of this may as well have moved around the entire qwerty layout, for what this is worth.I'm not fond of the clickety clack I hear when typing. The real Mac keyboard is so much quieter. Albeit for $100 more. If I were to keep this I would need not only to grow larger hands but to reprogram my brain for the slightly moved and drastically altered command option and control keys.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this keyboard because I liked the layout/tactile feel of the Apple keyboard but I needed it to work for Windows (which this keyboard does). It worked as soon as I plugged it in (didn't have to install or download anything). I am using it on a Windows 10 desktop PC and it works pretty much flawlessly as far as I can tell. The \"Windows\" key is the \"cmd\" key, in case you were wondering, and the \"Alt\" key is the \"option\" key. The feel of the keys themselves is very nice to type with, with a very satisfying clicky feel that is very similar to the Apple keyboard. I bought this specifically for gaming (weird, but it's the style of keyboard I like for gaming). You can switch the F1-F12 etc keys to be able to be activated by the Function key, or not, depending on how you like it, simply by pressing Esc+Fn. I prefer the F1-F12 keys to be usable for gaming hot keys, so I was able to configure those keys the way I liked for gaming without the additional functions getting in the way. The build quality is pretty good, although maybe note QUITE as good as the Apple, but generally feels about the same. I give the product a 5/5 score. Perfect for what I needed, which is an Apple-style keyboard that works on Windows PC's, plug-and-play, with nice build quality, and good layout. Love it.",
