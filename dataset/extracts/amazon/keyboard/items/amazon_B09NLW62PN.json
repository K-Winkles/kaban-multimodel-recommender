                "reviewText": "First off, let me say that I am a novelist, which means that I do a LOT of typing. Currently I'm working on an epic novel that is over 1.5 million words long. I mention this because my review of the Keychron V1 is based on its feel and functionality for TYPING, not gaming.Recently I found myself getting bored with typing on the keyboard I was using (a Qwerkywriter typewriter-style keyboard), so I started shopping around for a different one. Over the course of a month, I bought a dozen keyboards and ended up returning eight of them. Of the ones I kept (a Durgod Taurus 320 TKL with blue switches, a Royal Kludge limited edition with yellow switches, and a Steelseries membrane style keyboard), they were all terrific, but each had a tiny problem. Like \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears,\" one keyboard was too hard, another too soft, etc. But then I got the Keychron V1 (with red switches) and was BLOWN AWAY--by everything: the packaging, the palpable quality, and most of all by the smooth, crisp, quiet and effortless typing experience. The Keychron V1 is just right, or GOLDILOCKS as I put it.Every day, I write for 8 to 12 hours, producing between 2,000 and 5,000 words a day (the equivalent of 8 and 20 typed pages), which translates to a LOT of typing, so I need a keyboard that is going to be a joy to type on (and won't tire out my fingers). The Keychron V1 is that keyboard. I'll definitely keep and use (from time to time) the other keyboards I mentioned--we all need some variety--but in the V1 I see a true workhorse. From the moment I pulled it out of the packaging and experienced its heft, its gravitas, I knew it was going to be my go-to keyboard, and the one that will carry me through to the finish line on my epic novel.The keyboard has a couple features that I won't have any use for (e.g., the RGB backlighting), so I won't speak to those. I have no idea how this will perform for gaming, but I CAN attest to its perfection as a typing keyboard. If you are someone who does a lot of TYPING (a writer or a coder), do yourself a favor and GET THIS KEYBOARD. At about $100 it's a bargain.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this keyboard. The build quality is outstanding and typing on this keyboard (brown version) feels great. I love the knob and programming the keyboard using the VIA web app is really simple.My only suggestion to make this keyboard just a little bit better would be to add a fourth key on the far right side of the keyboard for the End key. It would be great to have them ordered as Home, PgUp, PgDn, End. I find myself hitting Home all the time wanting to go to the end of a line. I have mapped Fn+Home as the End key but it would be great to have that physical End key out of the box.",

                "reviewText": "I test-drove 10 keyboards to use at home with a Mac setup, plugged into an external monitor. Ultimately, Keychron was the best for me overall. I landed on this V1 for home and the V5 (same exact layout, but with added number pad) for the office.CRITERIA: One of the most important things to me was that the arrow keys had space around them, because I use the all the time, by feel. Many keyboards have these shoved within all the other keys, and no difference. I originally thought I wanted a 75% keyboard, which had the most options for offset arrow keys. I also wanted a delete key in the upper right, because I use that all the time. Again, without looking.WHY THIS ONE: This layout was the best of all worlds for me. It has offset arrow-keys (just enough to separate.) It has my enter and delete keys on the outer edges. It has a knob (a like to have, not MUST to have. Of all the keyboard brands I'd tried, Keychron was consistently high quality, without any bugs or issues. In my search, I'd also tried many different switches. I found BROWN were perfect for me. I wanted some tactile feel, but without extra \"thock\" or whatever the kids are calling it these days. I thought I might like blues, but found them to be too clicky -- meaning there was an extra, fake click, that felt like clipping a playing card in your bike spokes to sound like a motorcycle. Brown feels right. Feels old school. Feels solid and is not too noisy.I thought I might like the Keychron K8 or K8 Pro. I didn't like the bezel around these. It created an extra lip that my fingers had to go up and over. I like how the V-series has no bezel. They're very comfortable. As mentioned, I also ended up buying a V5 for work. Keychron also won-out because they have Mac keys.Lastly - I was originally hung up on wireless, but here's the thing. I work a hybrid situation. 2 days at home, 3 in the office. I never trust that my keyboard is fully charged, so I leave it plugged in all the time any way. Plus, even if I went wireless, I didn't want it failing in the middle of work, and having to dig out a cable, and find an empty USB slot. I found it easier to just admit to myself, I need wired, and will have to deal with that cable on my desk at all times.",
