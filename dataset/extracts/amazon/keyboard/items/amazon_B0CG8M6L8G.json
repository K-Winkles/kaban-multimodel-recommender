                "reviewText": "I ordered the Corsair RGB RAPIDFIRE Mechanical Gaming Keyboard recently because I decided that it was an opportune time to upgrade from my previous keyboard. I type a lot of papers and have played various types of games that demand different abilities from my keyboard. I determined that the Corsair Gaming Keyboard meets my needs the best compared to other available keyboards. Because of its value, features, and quality, this is one of the best keyboards on the market. The keyboard\u2019s price is one of the most competitive on the market. For example, the competing APEX PRO keyboard is on sale for $199.99 on Amazon. The Corsair keyboard was originally $169.99 but was on sale for $139.99. The two keyboards have similar features; each keyboard has a mechanical feel, they each have similar response times, and they are each RGB and programmable. The only difference is that the Corsair keyboard is $60.00 dollars less expensive. There were also some less expensive keyboards. For example, the Redragon K552 Mechanical Gaming Keyboard was $27.99, but was lacking in response time, feel, and durability. I was looking for an affordable keyboard that still had all of the high-quality features that I wanted, and I found that in the Corsair keyboard. In addition to its value price, the Corsair keyboard had many great features that sold me on it. As mentioned in the name, the keyboard is RGB. RGB means that the keyboard can light up in many different colors using the primary colors of red, green, and blue. The keyboard comes with pre-programmed light patterns, but you can also program your own light patterns. For example, certain keys can be programmed with different colors for gaming purposes. The keys can also be programmed to light up in sequential or timed order and in almost any color. I even managed to program the keys so that is looked like an American flag waving in the wind. You can adjust the lights on the keyboard by using the simple CORSAIR ICUE software. The keyboard also has a great mechanical feel without sacrificing any key response time. In addition, the keyboard has textured keys for the W, S, A, and D, as well as for the arrow keys to give them a comfortable gaming feel. A wrist or arm wrist precedes the keyboard to provide a correct, relaxed hand and finger level. There is also a volume roll bar adjuster, programmable short cut keys, and a number pad for use like a calculator. The quality of the keyboard was also another selling point. The keyboard frame is constructed from aircraft-grade, anodized, brushed aluminum, which is built to withstand a lifetime of heavy use. The keys themselves are constructed from high-quality plastic which allows them to withstand millions of keystrokes. There are also five different key options that vary in click feel, so there is a perfect keyboard for even the pickiest gamers. If you are worried about the durability of this keyboard, you can set that aside. Because of its value, features, and quality, this is one of the best keyboards on the market. I had few concerns regarding the packaging and shipping of the keyboard, but it arrived two days after I had placed my order and without any damage. I ordered this keyboard as an upgrade to my old one, and it exceeded my expectations.",

                "reviewText": "I love the keyboard itself. It's a bit louder than I'd like, but it's not supposed to be quiet-key essay writer anyway. For gaming, it's superb. Excellent board for the price, even still in 2023 (keyboards don't really age-out anyway).Feel is excellent, the extra AWSD keyset it comes with is a must to slap on, and the functionality is fantastic. Great LED customization options, and the lights are vibrant and bright, even during the day.My only complaint is with the god awful Corsair CUE software. It crashes *constantly* and always has major issues. Just killing the program and rebooting it clears things up, but it is very annoying having it crash and freeze so often. So, the software gets like a 1/5, but the keyboard itself gets top 5/5 marks.",

                "reviewText": "This keyboard is REALLY well made! The cording is super tough and extremely kink/pinching resistant. It has a usb slot at the top so you can plug in your mouse or whatever usb thing you want (phone charger, etc.) and then the cording ends with 2 usb cables, so the keyboard works as a bypass for you I love that the colored lighting shines through the text on the keys. I think the text won't fade much since it's not painted on and instead it's clear material. My key clicks are SUPER precise now when I'm gaming. Which is freaking great for my mmo games especially. The keyboard is really easy to clean too, I love it. There are 3 different brightness levels you can just press a button to change, and again to turn off the lighting all the way. The volume control wheel adjusts really smoothly. I didn't have to do anything to setup the keyboard I just plugged it in and it was already working fine. You can use the icue program to customize your colors and patterns, and make profiles. Once you have profiles set you can just press the button on the keyboard next to the brightness levels to cycle through which profile you want to use. You can even make your own custom patterns by selecting what color each specific key or group of keys are, like I made one that spells out my name in the static key colors, and another that is a heart pattern. There is also a function where there are color patterns on your keyboard that match the colors shown on your monitor screen automatically, and an audio visualizer option too for music or mic use. If you have other corsair products like a mouse or headset, etc. You can choose a function in icue that syncs the preset color patterns on all the corsair products you have automatically, so it can save you time, and makes for awesome aesthetic choices. The wrist rest you can attach from the keyboard, so you have options for more space for other ones if you don't like the one it comes with.",

                "reviewText": "So I noticed the keyboard was doubling key strokes, not a sign of quality. Corsair claims it fixed the double typing issue, but I've noticed it once since updating the firmware. Debating on returning this keyboard at this time. Ive used it for a few daysThe firmware update has reduced it significantly, but I cant tell if I am the one doing the typo or its the horrible corsair software doing the mistakes. Glad I didnt get rid of my old corsair keyboard. MAKE CORSAIR GREAT AGAIN.Updated Dec 4 2023:The K70 Core software is the problem or the keyboard is, I am not the one constantly double keystroking. I type for a livingThe only reason I got this keyboard was because the lights stayed off; I had spilled water on my Strafe previously... however after leaning how to delete profiles and factory reset (holding escape) , my lights worked again, however in the software settings, it was defaulting my brightness to zero on my keyboard. I proceeded to uninstall the Icue software and my keyboard now stays lit bright red. SHAME CORSAIR SHAME ON YOU.",

                "reviewText": "I had the previous version of the K70 till I spilled coffee on it, crapped out and I got an excuse to change it out. This new version is very nice, key layout is the exact same so no muscle memory re-learning for me. It doesn't have the old thick and sharp aluminum chassis it used to, has a thicker plastic body that is very sturdy. The switches are silent and buttery smooth, keyboard overall is easy to clean if you keep a small brush handy. the media buttons and volume wheel are much better looking, sturdier and more functional, and the onboard profile for RGB lighting does solve a lot of issues the software had which slowed down game launching and caused random crashes to many. The wrist support is ok I would recommend pairing it up with a thick foam wrist support (like a glorious padded keyboard wrist rest)",
