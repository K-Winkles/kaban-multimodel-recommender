                "reviewText": "USB connections wireless which is great. I bought to use for laptop so I was not limited to laptop keyboard and mouse square. Laptop sits in front of me and this keyboard still has trouble finding it's connection. Thought batters and replaced even through they were brand new. it seems to fall asleep and then difficulty waking up the keyboard. The mouse is all over the place and I spend more time trying to get it to stay still or lock onto the item i'm trying to select then actually getting work done. I was hopeful as I love the color. the keys are soft to type which is good but sometimes won't register the key. The number lock will sometimes shut down and stop working and have to insert batteries in and out to try to get it to come back to life. wrist not comfortable using mouse or keyboard. had to buy extra supports to help wrists. unfortunately will need to order a different type. This review was painful enough to type and use the mouse! Would not recommend.",

That seemed to help for about a month but now the mouse will not work at all. The keyboard is still working so I know it isn't the USB port - tried different ports and a different computer too. Worked great for some time - but not made to last.",
