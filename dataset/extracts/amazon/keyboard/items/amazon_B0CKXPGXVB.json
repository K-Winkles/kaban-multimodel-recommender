The keys and mouse are a bit stiff but I am sure it will be fine once I break them in.This was the cheapest keyboard and mouse set I could find on Amazon. The item arrived overnight so that was great. Everything was so easy to connect and the computer even prompt me when I plugged the USB piece in. Definitely worth every penny.",

                "reviewText": "This is a fantastic product, and evidently it can be used with either Mac or PC. I tested mine on the PC. I was extremely surprised to find just 1 USB comm dongle for the set. Other brands I have tried actually needed 2 different ports. I'm using them now, straight plug-and-play; no third party software necessary to get running. The ergonomic curve of the keyboard is gentle which I appreciate. Most other keyboards I have come across have a much stronger bend to them. The typing is responsive, though I am still trying to get my bearing with the position of the keys...actually I strongly recommend this to people who like the traditional style, but don't want to go with what feels like the arm twisting throwback....plus it's also not like some other, extreme mountainous keyboards I've worked with (Microsoft)...the raised portion is more gentle and fits cleanly in my desk. The keys make little noise, and is more conducive to working in an environment with others....no loud annoying clicks. I get some people like that, but your neighbor doesn't. As for the mouse, it's as functional as you can ask. It's responsive and moves just how it's supposed to. It's not a gaming mouse, but this set is really for people who need to get jobs done, and may want to sit with the keyboard in their lap, or even work in bed. Distance wise, it handles about 10-15ft pretty well, but if you're that far from your system, you're probably not able to read the screen. Oh, and another pleasant surprise, each item, keyboard and mouse, needed only 1 AA battery. Now, I know you're thinking 'I don't want to deal with batteries, lets get that rechargeable one.' My response is simply to be prepared to buy another keyboard when yours gives out. I've included pictures from above and the side to give you an idea of how high the center is. Please forgive the dust.",
