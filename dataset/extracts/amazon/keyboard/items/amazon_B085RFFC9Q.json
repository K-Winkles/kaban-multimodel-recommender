                "reviewText": "Is it expensive? Yes, but for some people it's worth it, for others it's not. That's up to you to decide for yourself, but price aside, I'll just tell you about the keyboard.The G915 works really well for me. I got the linear version and the key presses are much quieter than the G513 linear keys, which weren't really loud to begin with. I play a lot of Overwatch, so I hit the keys hard when I play. My gf can tell a difference in the noise when I play.The media controls are a good feature. The volume knob is a smooth scroll. For some reason I assumed it would be clicky/notchy, but it's not. The G513 had to use a Fn button to access the media controls, which was a little annoying. Also you can't customize the colors of the media/memory/other special function keys at the top. Kinda lame.Not a big deal, but I like the light up G in the upper left corner. Matches my mouse and mouse pad.I wasn't specifically looking for a slim mechanical keyboard, but this keyboard had all the features I wanted. It turns out that I do enjoy the feel of typing on it. The key travel doesn't feel too short (like the new MacBook keyboards). I also appreciate how heavy and sturdy the base is. Also, because the base is so thin, I don't feel like I need a wrist rest anymore (the G513 came with a really cushy one, which I loved). Dimitri from Hardware Canucks said you wouldn't need a wrist rest, and I agree. My keyboard sits on my super oversized mouse mat. The mouse mat serves as a soft place for my wrists while I type, in the same way that I lay my wrist on it when I use the mouse.I also do like the G keys on the left side of the keyboard. Now the new G Hub software is buggy, not too intuitive, and lacks some features when compared to the Logitech Gaming Software. But I was able to map one of the G keys to cycle through my different audio outputs. It makes it easy for when I want to switch between my speakers and headset which are always physically connected to my PC. The old way I used to switch audio outputs was by right clicking on the speaker icon in the taskbar. Just another small convenience. The one thing I don't like about the G keys though is my left pinky naturally gravitates towards the G5 key (the lower left most key) when I try to use the Ctrl key. I'm assuming I'll get used to the layout over time, but right now it's a bit hard retraining myself. Btw, on the plus side for the new G Hub software , it does give a bit more control on custom lighting for your logitech devices. It's not great and definitely not as good as Corsair's software and level of customization though.I bought the wireless version. Now I don't plan on using it wirelessly so it's always plugged in, but the reason I wanted it is because there's a button which can quickly switch the keyboard to bluetooth mode. I have it paired with my phone so when I get a text on my phone, I just hit the bluetooth key on the keyboard and quickly type a text message. (Just to be clear, I'm still looking at my phone while I'm typing -- I'm just using the keyboard to type.) Then I quickly switch back to continue using my computer. It's a nice convenience.One thing that I don't like about the keyboard is that the symbols are not backlit on the top row number keys (and other keys). Maybe they do it for aesthetics, but sometimes I miss that feature when I'm typing in a dark room.All in all, I'm pretty happy. It was definitely expensive, but for me, it does a lot of the things I want it to do and that was important to me.Btw, in case you didn't notice, the wired version of this keyboard has a USB passthrough, which the wireless version doesn't have. Just in case you wanted that feature.",

                "reviewText": "This is early in ownership, but I can already tell I like this keyboard better than all others.Let's address the cost. It is expensive for a keyboard. The balance is more than enough to justify it. It's built like Bavarians used to build automobiles. It has everything: it's Bluetooth and it pairs effortlessly to everything, a dongle link for faster performance, colors colors colors galore and all programmable, it has mechanical keys that feel like I'm not using any effort to type, and it's a Logitech.The backlight illuminates keys that are very easy to read, even in dark blue (which I have a hard time seeing). It keeps a charge for a long time. I haven't run the battery down yet, and I'm trying. I'm sure it gets better mileage than a Tesla.The form factor is amazing. It is so thin that my wrists get some relief compared to my other keyboards which now seem so thick.Save yourself some money. Don't do what I did and buy three other keyboards before you finally realize that you can do what you want with the first choice -- even if it's costly.Have you heard the old adage? You get what you pay for.----------Addendum:At the one-month mark I can confidently say I never want another keyboard. Ever.While figuring out the G Hub software utility is a lot like an scifi thriller where the hero has to decode the message from aliens to avert a catastrophe, I figured it out on the fourth or sixth try. Logitech makes good hardware. They fail utterly at documenting their utilities. Should I gig 'em for that. Yes. Will I? No.That's because their keyboard probably rates a seven out of five, so they have some wiggle room.I'm starting to realize that all my peripherals are Logitech: camera, mouse, keyboard, headset... I even have the ComboTouch cover/keyboard for my iPad. None of this was by long-range design. It just happened. Go figure.I stand by my original comments and add that the battery has proven to be powerful and long-lasting. A single charge takes me through more than a week of work and play. This is with the backlight. I don't keep the light on high because I don't need that bright light. But the backlight is on when I'm typing. I like the way my keyboard starts blinking at me to tell me that my battery is low. I'm sure there are still days of charge left when it does that, but I recharge to stop the nagging.I highly (most highly) recommend this keyboard.",

                "reviewText": "Avalia\u00e7\u00e3o detalhada:Primeiro acho legal falar quais teclados eu j\u00e1 tive experi\u00eancia para ter como refer\u00eancia.Redragon Kumara, Logitech MK220, Logitech K380, Logitech G613, Logitech G815.Bom, usando teclados de perfil mais alto e mais baixo, claramente me acostumei de forma melhor, mais r\u00e1pida e mais confort\u00e1vel no perfil baixo. Ent\u00e3o decidi procurar um teclado com perfil baixo...Depois que tive um teclado sem fio, \u00e9 um caminho sem volta, ainda mais com a tecnologia LightSpeed da logitech que mesmo em jogos online de FPS ele funciona perfeitamente IGUAL cabo. Ent\u00e3o decidi procurar um teclado sem fio...O software de programa\u00e7\u00e3o GHUB \u00e9 fant\u00e1stico, s\u00e3o infinitas as op\u00e7\u00f5es, macros, altera\u00e7\u00f5es de teclas de software que estou usando, jogos que estou jogando etc... ele faz tudo isso de forma autom\u00e1tica e fica tudo muito perfeito e funcionando sem erros, depois de usar dif\u00edcil ficar sem.Parte multim\u00eddia \u00e9 toda em silicone igual o G815 que \u00e9 super suave ao toque e de boa constru\u00e7\u00e3o, acho que a mistura dos switchs com essas teclas multi em silicone fica muito luxuoso e acabamento bem premium.Por fim, as teclas G1-6 do G815 fazem um pouco de falta, coisa que temos no G915 normal sem ser o TKL, mas no GHUB vc faz essa altera\u00e7\u00f5es para as teclas F1-12 por exemplo e nem vai sentir falta das teclas extras. (imagem em anexo)LEDS do teclado \u00e9 super sutil, nada gritante e n\u00e3o transborda das teclas deixando o digitar e o setup de noite bem premium nada ofuscante igual outros teclados com led vazados que parece um show de luzes. (tem quem goste)Conex\u00e3o WI-FI e B.T funciona perfeitamente, conecta muito r\u00e1pido, praticamente instant\u00e2neo ao apertar o bot\u00e3o de sele\u00e7\u00e3o Wifi ou B.T. Essa fun\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 muito boa para quem usa 2 computadores, ou computador + tablet, etc...Scroll de volume, Isso a Logitech realmente inovou e ficou incr\u00edvel, toque super suave com o scroll em alum\u00ednio, acabamento super delicado e funciona perfeitamente.PQ comprei esse teclado ?Bom, estava procurando as seguintes caracter\u00edsticas:- Perfil baixo de teclas- Conex\u00e3o Wifi com receptor USB- Multi conex\u00e3o entre B.T e WIFI- Teclas program\u00e1veis- RGB- TKL- Perfil internacional (ABNT \u00e9 muito ruim)Essas especifica\u00e7\u00f5es encontrei apenas em 2 teclados, no Redragon Horus vers\u00e3o internacional que vai sair na casa dos R$ 600,00 reais j\u00e1 com taxas e impostos importante do Ali. Por\u00e9m o acabamento, RGB, scroll de volume etc.. ficam bem a baixo do G915, um ao lado do outro parece que o Horus \u00e9 uma c\u00f3pia fuleira ao lado de uma pe\u00e7a original. Enfim, vendi o meu G815 e comprei esse G915 TKL na promo\u00e7\u00e3o por R$ 730,00.Super satisfeito, RECOMENDO!",

Let alone any racing wheel setup as simple or complex as you want, a full plane cockpit, a mouse/keyboard, a plethora of flightsticks, whatever arcade joysticks you like, plus all the custom stuff.But the desk and the wires right?I've been on wireless gear for quite a while, as for the past 10 years, my PC/Laptop has been connected to a TV and I operate on a couch, desks are for working, unless of course I'm working from home.Having been using a basic 10 year old Logitech keyboard, it was time for an upgrade. I was ready for an upgrade, and decided I wanted a mechanical keyboard. I was considering the Logitech G613, but the lack of a backlight killed it for me, though even a simple white backlight would have led me to save the 200$ and go with that one. That said...this keyboard is premium quality top to bottom. If you are a mechanical snob and fret over switches, well the keys could be hit or miss, but if you've been tooling around with a membrane keyboard all your life, this is nothing but glory. The satisfying snap of the keys when they bottom out and that instant feedback when your keystrokes register are fantastic.As a keyboard that sits on my lap, I was primarily concerned with the lack of a wrist rest, and it's largely no big deal due to the low profile of the unit itself. It would have been nice to have....something, but I think I'm going to have to make my own custom lap pad, with an inset area to sink a rest in, as just about every wrist pad is going to be too thick to comfortably position my hands. This is probably my biggest complaint. The battery life is good so far, even with the RGB illumination, but that will decrease it. Keep it dim or off and you have a pretty solidly performing device, that you may have to charge every week or two (lights on). Having a mini USB cable instead of the USB C connection is a bit of a bummer, it would have been nice to just be able to throw my phone cable into the board and use it while charging, but that's just a small niggle.The illumination options are good, and GHUB allows you to download more. I'm still figuring out the ins and outs of the software.There are 5 macro keys on the left. I have not much use for these as of now, but maybe I will start to adapt to having them, i've just never really had macro keys, and have never really used, them. Despite reviews critical about the volume roller, I've found that while there is a lack of real tactile feedback, the volume meter on screen reacts instantly. If you have a slower computer I can see where it might show a delay, but that will largely come down to being a windows issue, maybe a LITTLE bit more resistance on it would have been nice, just to feel like I'm using a volume knob.I was initially worried that the floating keys would feel flimsy, but compared to any membrane board I've ever used, they are in place and have a nice satisfying clack to them. I didn't get the clicky keys as they seem like they would be extremely annoying. The tactile has a nice natural thwack to them when you hit key bottom, with an audible click of the key bottoming out, without a tinny click that sounds to me, to be engineered in, and not a natural consequence of the technology. I cannot comment on how the linear keys feel. I do a mix of typing and gaming and this keyboard is a great balance for both. I also can't live without a number pad, but there is a tenkeyless option if you would rather not have it.",
