I love the simplicity of this keyboard, it came packaged in the manufacturer's box, but very well protected, batteries included for the keyboard and mouse (note this is not a rechargeable set but I knew that prior to ordering.) They work in tangent with the same USB key. The mouse is very sleek and thin which is good for my wrist, keeps it in a more neutral position. The keyboard comes with a well-fitting dust protector. I think my only problem with it is it almost feels a little tacky(rubber feel) which is harder to type quickly. I may just need to get used to that though. It can easily be removed if it bothers me in the long run.Overall super excites and pleased with this purchase.",

I do have some specific comments.Good:* At only 14.5\" wide including a full numeric pad, the compact size saves desktop space.* The light aqua blue color is aesthetically pleasing and does not show dust and dirt as readily as black.* Keys and mouse have good tactile feel.Bad:* Manual should be improved. It has no mention of the small on/off switch in the mouse's bottom face, and no instructions on the proper turn on sequence. I did not see the small on/off switch (factory default is off) and of course the mouse did not work. I thought the batteries had been sitting in the box too long and replaced them but without success. I finally saw the switch and moved it to the ON position. Still no go! I had to remove and reinsert the batteries and the wireless adapter from the PC to make the mouse work.Ugly:I finally realized that there is a thin plastic film glued on the keyboard's top section which can be removed. Doing so improves the evenness of that top section. The matte finish on the rest of the keyboard has some uneven blotches of color which detracts from the overall appearance.",

At 14.5\" width, it is a little narrower than my old Logitech 17\" keyboard yet typing is quite comfortable. Its small Nano receiver is only usable with USB-A ports, so I purchased USB-A to USB-C adapter (Type C Thunderbolt 4 OTG Converter by Henrety) at $5 for a 3-pack - these adapters work great with the keyboard and mouse. There is a disclaimer that function keys (hot keys) are not fully compatible with a Mac, but this is not important. More important is that the Delete key, Home key, End key and Page Up/Down keys are fully compatible, so generating long documents in Word are easy to manage.",
