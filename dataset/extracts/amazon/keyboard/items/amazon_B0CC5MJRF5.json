                "reviewText": "I initially saw it as a suggested item on the homepage and was curious. I'm always looking for a keyboard to work with the little desk space I have. Size wise, it's perfect. Just the right size. The rubber grips on the bottom make it a decent lap keyboard too. While some people complain about the key shape, while I agree that this is more of a gimmick anda showpiece, it works for me. I went with the pink one because the F and J keyes were different colors, which for me makes it easier to readjust if my fingers get lost on the keyboard.Honestly, while for me it works fine and I was able to adjust to the layout and key shapes pretty easily, I know this isn't for everyone. If there's one thing I've learned as a writer, it's that everyone has their own preference for what works for them when it comes to keyboards. So what works for one person may not work for someone else.My only real issues with the keyboard is that the spring on the spacebar is a little loud and squeaks sometimes, and sometimes it doesn't register that I've hit the spacebar even when I've pressed down on it. Other than that, I don't know if it just takes longer than most tech to charge or if mine is defective, but for some reason when unplugged it refuses to show any sign that it's charged at all. I haven't been able to use the bluetooth feature because of that, but other than that when it's plugged in I do really like the keyboard overall.",

The body is aluminum and the keys are plastic with a smooth, semi-soft feel to them. It has a good weight and the rubber feet make sure it doesn\u2019t slide around my desk. The keys are smooth. It feels like a semi-mechanical membrane keyboard.The only thing I don\u2019t like about it is that some of the buttons are in weird places. I\u2019m constantly pressing the up arrow when I want to press right shift. It may be possible to remap the keys if you\u2019re an advance PC user and fix this issue.I use the keyboard plugged in and have not tried the Bluetooth so I can\u2019t comment on that or it\u2019s battery life.",

The packaging itself was also impressive. I don't think I've ever had such a fancy box for a keyboard before \ud83d\ude05My only small issue is the placement and size of the right shift key. The up arrow is far larger, leading me to at time hit it instead of shift when I am trying.Aside from that, this is a great keyboard for the price!",

It is pretty spacious as far as the distance between each key because it\u2019s big. Nevertheless this keyboard is very nice it doesn\u2019t have clicky key sounds, it doesn\u2019t sound like a type writer, it Bluetooth capable and it can also be hard wired. I like it was a nice addition to my pc.",
