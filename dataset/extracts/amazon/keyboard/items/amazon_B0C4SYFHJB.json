                "reviewText": "I like this keyboard and mouse so far. The protective cover feels pleasant to the touch and slightly reduces the sound of typing. The setup was quick and easy. I read a review where someone said the USB-C end of the receiver didn't work for them. However, the receiver must be inserted with the arrow side up. The mouse is very responsive and works well on different surfaces. The colors are just as shown and match my Cricut perfectly! Although I had some trouble reconnecting the receiver after disconnecting it for a few hours, I didn't face any issues when I left the receiver connected, even after turning my computer on and off multiple times.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely loved this keyboard and mouse combo - especially for the price. The colors are beautiful and the keys are satisfying to type on. It is a very spacious keyboard and the side number pad makes it easier for me to run codes for my job. My Mac quickly recognized both devices and worked perfectly once the \"OS\" key was activated. The mouse is also very cute and comfortable. Might seem small to some who use a traditional mouse, but it wasn't an issue for me (I didn't find it small or uncomfortable to use). I also love that the keyboard and mouse use only one battery each.MY ONLY ISSUE SO FAR: the connectivity fails at times. My cat likes to sleep near my laptop (specifically between the laptop and my keyboard/mouse). Every time she lies between the receptor and the devices, the connectivity is slightly interrupted and lags. It seems the reception sensitivity can be affected by barriers directly in the way. If I move my cat out of the way or slightly move the keyboard/mouse to directly face the receptor, the issue goes away... but my cat's favorite spot to nap is right there on my laptop, so it does happen often.",
