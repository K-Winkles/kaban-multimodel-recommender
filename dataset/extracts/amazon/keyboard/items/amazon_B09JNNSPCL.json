If your games won't utilize those buttons, it's fine...So ok for gaming, not great for normal keyboard use.",

I did get the Prtsc button to work by holding down Fn... I would never use a keyboard that lacks the basic function of Prtsc which is often used to take snapshots of in-game screens that can be shared on social media. I am satisfied with the RGB lights but the noise level of typing words is really loud which makes it difficult to send secret messsages on social media without my aunt hearing it. At the same time, typing loudly does make people think you are super fast at typing which is one way to show off your typing skills and land good impressions. I recommend this keyboard. It is great!!",
