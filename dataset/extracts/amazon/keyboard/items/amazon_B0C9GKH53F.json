                "reviewText": "The Acebaff CK230UL rainbow backlit keyboard is a darkhorse of quality inexpensive computer keyboards. If you are looking for a low-cost silent keyboard that looks good, feels nice and types quite well, then read on.Pros:Extremely quiet keyboard that feels good to type on and decent build quality; also quite responsive.Dedicated quick keys8 levels of brightness (7 levels of lighting, 1 for completely off)Evenly distributed backlightingEasy to read letter/numbers/symbols.Adjustable keyboard stand.Perfect for an office or other environment where low noise is a must.Keyboard's letters/numbers/symbols look pretty clean even when no backlighting is used (in an adequately lit environment where backlighting is not needed).Cons:No solid color selections (stuck with rainbow layout - might be distracting to some).No wrist rest.Indifferent/OdditiesLighting effects - breathing effects with 6 speeds, and response mode (keys light up when struck, and has 6 adjustable decay times for lighting to go off (does anyone really use either of these?)SCROLL LOCK indicator is swapped with a WINDOWS LOCK indicator (locks windows key and shows up a \"W\" when lit). Not a dealbreaker for me but might be for some if they use scroll lock a lot)Keys might feel somewhat \"sticky\" or \"mushy\" at first but you get used to it.The bottom line:While the rainbow backlight may first come across as distracting, it's not obnoxiously bright and has levels of brightness that can suit any user. I got used to it pretty quickly. The LED's are placed correctly underneath as this keyboard gives off very even illumination on the majority of the keyboard - the only exception to this is the row of 8 quick keys which do not have transparent symbols on them and the border lighting is pretty weak in this area - another led underneath this row would have probably helped a lot. It's a minor issue at best, however. What's more is if you are not working in low lighting conditions it can be turned off and it still gives the appearance of a cleanly laid out keyboard with decent clarity on the letters/symbols and numbers.In regard to the lighting effects - you get the breathing effect with 6 available speed cycles and also a response mode which basically means the keyboard will remain unlit until a key is struck and then the backlighting will fade out again when typing stops (6 levels of decay time available). You can also run with solid lighting and 8 levels of brightness (actually the lowest setting just turns the backlight off completely so it is really 7 levels of actual brightness) and you also have the option of turning off the backlighting completely. Only these last two features are of any use to me personally as I find breathing, color scrolling and any of those other cutesy light effects to be distracting and quite frankly - annoying. All the same - this keyboard has some the lighting effects available if you must have that going on.One side note here - I have read and heard some complaints that this keyboard doesn't retain its backlight settings after the computer is turned off. Perhaps while the older versions of this may have had this problem, the 2023 version does not - I can confirm it retains the backlighting preferences even after the computer is shut off overnight.What I would love to see with this model: A version that just offers solid color backlighting with selectable colors along with the 8 levels of brightness and none of the silly effects. I would even settle for just plain old white backlighting with the brightness controls, personally.This is quite possibly the most comfortable keyboard I have ever typed on - at the very least it ranks pretty high up in my own experience (and I have literally typed on hundreds of different models over my lifetime). The keys are soft to the touch and feel quite smooth - there is no evident friction on keystroke releases and the thing is literally silent. Even tapping hard it still won't be very audible. The keys also have little or no wobble to them and I would say there is almost zero chance that a key would get stuck on one of its edges in the keyboard chassis.One thing to note however - when one first types on this keyboard they may get the sense of the keys feeling sticky or mushy - and this is especially true if you are coming from a mechanical style keyboard. If one needs the clicky sound/mechanical feedback then this probably isn't the keyboard for you.If you prefer low noise laptop style keys and need a very quiet and responsive keyboard to avoid annoying coworkers in your office or sleeping roommates or whatever else - then this keyboard is a MUST HAVE. Bar none, this is the quietest keyboard I have ever used and easily in the top three most comfortable keyboards (and yes I have used much much more expensive keyboards in my day) as well.One oddity about this keyboard are the lock lights - while the CAPS LOCK and NUMBER LOCK indicators are present there is no indicator for SCROLL LOCK. Instead the last lamp for this is actually for WINDOWS LOCK (lights up as a \"W\"), which basically locks the windows key up to prevent microsoft menus from being accidentally popped up. This is not an issue for me as I do not use scroll lock very much, but it may be for people who do use this feature a lot.Also this keyboard sports flip out stands, so it can be run completely flat or at the standard angle, and the build quality overall is quite good considering this keyboard sells for around $15-$20. The addition of 13 dedicated quick keys is also nice and the plastic used in the casing of this keyboard is quality enough and heavy enough that it is a bit less prone to sliding around on smooth surfaces than lighter keyboardsIf I had any initial concerns, it would be how well the keys hold up from wear over time. Since this is a pretty cheap keyboard there is the possibility of the letters getting worn off over time or possibly keys start getting stuck and stuff like that. I've only had mine for a few days so I cannot comment on this.I was very skeptical about the Acebaff CK230UL when I first came across it. But even if this were to only last 2-3 years - it is still an absolute steal at this price. There is a lot to like about this keyboard. Definitely recommended.",

                "reviewText": "This just arrived yesterday but I've spent about 8 hours using it and I love it. The keys are perfectly spaced, the lighting is awesome, the shortcut keys are very useful, the calculator keys are larger which is useful, the size is very nice, and did I say that the quietness is very, very peaceful. Overall, I type faster and more accurately with this, and it's pleasurable enough that I want to be using it....so in two ways at least it adds to my work efficiency and pays for itself. This is a quality piece of merchandise.One very small issue: I wish it came with an instruction book that explained what all the keys did. There is a small sheet identifying the function each key performs, but I have no idea what some of the functions are.If I change my mind on my rating I'll change it and write about it here.",

                "reviewText": "I have never seen a keyboard like this before! It\u2019s tough to find a keyboard with a combination of features like this without omitting other key features in the process. If you\u2019re looking for a slim designed keyboard that comes with a variety of multimedia keys then this one is decked out. It\u2019s got quite a few dedicated macros: mute, sleep, calculator, search, browser, refresh, bookmarks, and more but those are my favorites. Seems to have darn near everything so the fact that it comes with RGB on top of all this is a real bonus.Every FN key also has a dedicated counterpart which I thought was impressive. I never liked FN lock anyway. It can be a hassle and cause for confusion, but this keyboard seems to have done away with it altogether which is great. Granted, it probably costs another half an inch in desk space to have these extra keys at the top but the overall design is slim and rectangular enough to be a great choice. Part of what makes this possible is the keys are huge! (I mean, relatively) This is a slim design keyboard after all and it has a lot of keys so relative to that the keys are big and you won\u2019t have major trouble fat fingering your way around it. Considering the silent design, for a while I was concerned with how much tactile feedback these keys would actually have. The keys are very quiet, so they are good in that sense, but if your hoping for felty keys with a nice slight \u201cbump\u201d to them then in my opinion, these have barely enough. Then again, these are large rectangular, chiclet keys so they are still pretty mashable and I feel that it covers the difference while gaming. You will love it if like me you are the type to actually prefer slim or chiclet over mechanical keys.I was happy to see more rubber padding on the bottom corners than I did before buying. My desk has a pretty slick surface. The extendable feet on the bottom slide around a bit and could use some more padding but the other pads on the bottom get the job done.",
