It comes with a cute extra key that has a flower that I put over my escape key. Really cute. All of the keys came working and the mouse is really straight forward to use.

                "reviewText": "This keyboard and mouse set is so cute!!! It looks exactly like the photo. One thing I love is that the keys themselves have sort of a soft, powdery velvet texture when I touch the keys. Love it!It also came with a cute little clear acrylic key with a cute little flower inside it, which I replaced the ESC key with. So cute!The mouse also is very comfy to use. Both the mouse and keyboard need a AAA battery, and I really like that they each have their own power switch! The Bluetooth connection is strong as well.If you like the clickity-clackie sound of mechanical keyboards, you\u2019ll LOVE using this one. Very crisp sounds while also still being kind of soft? Hard to explain but as someone who is autistic and has misophonia, this keyboard makes some great sounds that don\u2019t irritate me! Quite the opposite actually, they\u2019re very relaxing!Overall, I seriously give this a 10/10 and highly recommend this keyboard and mouse set!",

                "reviewText": "I've used split ergonomic keyboards for years and was nervous about how functional this would be for me. I've been wanting a typewriter style keyboard for years but they'd all been so expensive it wasn't worth the risk. I got this during the Cyber Monday sale and was willing to risk the cost if I didn't like using it long term.I LOVE IT! It doesn't have the same click as a typewriter when you type but I'm obsessed with the round keys, it does give it an entirely different feel. I also like that it has the 10 key pad like a standard keyboard, and I love that all the F function keys are separate from the numbered keys on the main keyboard. I don't know why but it is really satisfying to have them separate, and they work just the same, you just have to reach a little farther to hit one of the F functions.It only takes one battery, so I'm curious how long the lifespan of it will be before needing a new one, so I recommend always having one on hand. It has a low battery light indicator, which is nice, but in other keyboards they've always given me like 5 minutes warning then they are out of juice.It didn't come with instructions, which I didn't find odd...until I tried to figure out how to turn it on. The on/off switch is on the side at the top right corner. It took me holding it up rotating it and someone watching me also wondering where the button was before they finally saw it. Other than that it was an easy setup and I love it, very happy I purchased this!",

                "reviewText": "Edit: The replacement works great. I'm happy that I stuck with the keyboard instead of getting a refund. My only complaint now is that they swapped with with a different model. The keyboard is more or less the same, just a little darker, but the mouse isn't as cute. The middle scroll wheel jostles side to side a little bit which is a bit annoying. It just feels a bit cheap.But I do love the keyboard overallThe entire row Esc, 1, Q, A, Z don't work. I have to press them multiple times before they input. I've ordered a replacement and hopefully that one works better. If so I'll edit my reviewAside from that, the keyboard is super cute. I was worried that the keys would be awkward or feel clumsy to type on but they feel great. Its almost satisfying to use them.At first I felt that the mouse going into sleep mode and having to click to wake it up was a bit awkward but I got used to it quickly and feel like its a nice feature.I appreciate that it comes with a cleaning brush and is easy to clean with the pop-off keys.I'm really hoping that the replacement works because I love this keyboard.",

Everything works great, it came with a cute little clear floral replacement key, and the mouse works fine too. The only confusing thing was the installation: I assumed I could just turn it on and Bluetooth connect to my computer, and the instructions said to take out the USB from under the keyboard. So when I looked in the battery compartment for the USB, there is a space for one and I thought they'd forgotten mine, but then I read the reviews and saw that the USB for the mouse is also the USB that connects the keyboard to the copmputer.

                "reviewText": "For the most part I really love this keyboard. There was a little bit of a learning curve getting my fingers used to the location and feel of the keys, as I was more familiar with flatter square keys. Because of how high they sit, you have to concentrate a little more on pressing straight down whereas with flatter keyboards you can come in at a bit of an angle and it doesn't matter. I bought it for its beautiful colors and the satisfying clickety clack sound, and it was 100% what I wanted in those two categories. That said, as a vigorous (maybe a bit violent) typer, this keyboard wound up being a little too loud for me. I could take notes during meetings, or hear the other participants, but not both at the same time. I started to worry that I would wake my baby who sleeps in a different room. It is LOUD. Also as a vigorous typer, I can happily report that all of the letters are still present on the keys, the whole thing looks brand new despite frequent use as I work from home. I have never had an issue with it or the mouse connecting, and I think I have replaced the batteries once in two years.In summary: cute, durable, reliable, loud enough to drown out computer audio and wake other members of the house.",

Although the key layout does take some getting used to. The key caps feel like typing on a typewriter, it's such a cool design.The colours are a lot more vibrant than displayed, which I found to be great. Furthermore, at the bottom of the keyboard are these little hinges that allow you to lift the keyboard up, this makes it fantastic if you have wrist issues typing. It makes you more likely to keep your wrists in a raised position to type so you don't accidentally rest them on your desk and risk straining your wrist or getting wrist pain.Overall I think this is so well-priced. A great quality mouse and keyboard for 89 dollars is well worth the price.",
