                "reviewText": "So I just received this keyboard today.My first impressions are actually being compared to the Redragon K552 WR keyboard that I bought and received at the same time (trying to decide which would be my \"more fun\" new work, typing, excel keyboard).First of all, this is not a mechanical keyboard, I think it's a membrane...? Regardless it does have a nice, pleasant typing sound to it and I find the keys and key spacing to be very comfortable.The main reason I got this keyboard is because it is a true RGB keyboard - giving access to the 16 million colors or whatever it is. The true potential of this comes after installing the logitech g hub software (which was simple and easy, runs great). My only gripe so far is that I haven't found a brightness setting. I'm sure there is one and maybe I'm just being a bit dense...Some highlights:- full numeric keypad, this is a must for a lot of data entry and numbers crunching- dedicated media control buttons- simple lighting software letting me designate key zones in whatever color I want (currently matching the LED lights on the back of my monitor).- Audio reactive mode: This was actually quite fun. Put it in this mode, set your colors, and start playing music. This will highlight various key zones based upon lows, mids, and highs of your music (definitely interactive), though I'm not sure if this works with video game sound effects like gunfire...- wrist rest: I haven't typically used a wrist rest in the past but I'm finding this much more comfortable than the squared edge of my desk- incline feet: these things feel secure and raise the keyboard up to a great incline! Actually feels quite ergonomic- various lighting modes which can be fun to play withOverall: I ended up returning the reddragon keyboard and will be keeping this.Primary Reasons why:- fully adjustable lighting (reddragon only had modes, no color changing)- numeric keypad- more comfortable typing position",

                "reviewText": "I love the way the keys feel. My last keyboard was a rather expensive one, but the keys were so loud! With this one, I can type as aggressively as I want without waking up the whole house. They also have a very nice feel to them when pressed, it takes just enough pressure to avoid typos. The price was fair (I did get it on sale though) and the quality is great. I don't game with it, so I can't comment on the efficiency of that aspect. One of the backlight color options is teal and it matches my mouse which is an added bonus. I can see the keys easily in the dark, and there is a good amount of elevation between the keys and the board so it's easy not to mis-type anything. The built in wrist rest also makes typing a super comfortable experience! All in all I'm super satisfied with this purchase and I would purchase it again if anything goes wrong, although I doubt there will be any issues. I would recommend this if you're looking for a middle of the road but quality keyboard for your desktop :]",

                "reviewText": "Pros !It's a good keyboard for the money you pay.It is slim and quiet (it's a membrane keyboard) but precise when you type.It has a very fast response.It has RGB Backlight 5 zones I can work with that... actually, you can separate the size of the letters in 3 different color zones, which will help nothing wrong with that !And this is just my personal preference. I love that the keys are digged in the board so no light leaks around the keys. I am not a fun of floating keys on top of the board.CONS :* NO Macrokeys That is the biggest con for me!I would love to have 6 macros programmable G Keys on my little finger. I used to have and used a G105 That was great... ( 9 years abused and heavily used :))* Backlight Quality is inconsistent, Some keys letter are not uniform lighting, and if you would not know where the letter should be it gets hard to read... So for that reason, the backlight for 25 percent of the keys is totally unusable* The FONTS... well... maybe I am the fussy one but the Fonts, just can not stand with them.The arrow signs... bleah.. The small symbols are so poorly drawn.. if you don't know exactly where each symbols are on what key, it will be a challenge to find out what the symbols is...",

AAs far as non mechanical keyboards go, it's really nice.The typing does feel slightly membrane, but each key also feels very responsive and pleasant to type on. I love the wrist rest, and there's legs on the back if you'd like to prop the keyboard up slightly, though I prefer it laying flat.The built in media keys are very convenient to have for apps like Youtube and Spotify. The LEDs are pleasant to look at, without being obnoxiously bright. This keyboard also features a number pad which is appreciated considering I use this keyboard at work (IT) and I constantly deal with numbers.This is one of the better membrane keyboards avaiable, and while I still prefer mech for most applications, this keyboard does not disappoint.",
