                "reviewText": "I love this keyboard! The keys have a pleasant quiet thonk sound and the round keys were not difficult to adapt to. It looks beautiful without losing any functionality. There is no back lighting though.The included mouse is cute and has a button to adjust curser speed. There is plastic on the bottom pads when it arrives; if you don't take it off, the mouse will have some drag. After a few minutes of disuse, the mouse will automatically turn off. To awaken it, just click a button and it'll start responding immediately.There is a single receiver for both the keyboard and mouse, which is great to reduce the number of ports you have to use if you plan to use both items. Both items require one AA battery apiece. There is no software you have to install to use these either.Edit: I have since ordered and received a second keyboard/mouse combo in the \"Off White\" set. The mouse for this set does not have an on/off switch but the \"Light Off-White Colorful\" one pictured does have a switch.",

So I paired it with a Logitech one.They keyboard itself was easy to set up & responds very well when typing. It seems the keys are fully colored so I\u2019m hoping there is no fading when it comes to the colors like other brands I saw that had a similar style. The sound is so soothing to me so I love it! Of course the keyboard is so cute and not even a day of using it and I got so many compliments!I noticed other comments mention the closeness of the keys but honestly I haven\u2019t found them to be different spatially from other keyboard, so really it feels very easy to use!",

The keystroke has a little noise, but not much more than others.It\u2019s easy to get going - Plug in the USB Dongle add a AA battery to the keyboard and one to the mouse and you\u2019re good to go!It was packed securely in shipping. The keyboard is of good quality, when typing the keyboard is durable. It is still lightweight and wireless, therefore portable.I know that it\u2019s great for gaming, but I purchased this keyboard for the raised keys feature. My nails are naturally very long and I don\u2019t want to cut them, unfortunately at times this can make it hard to type.Regular keyboards have flat and flush keys. I found that I would hit several keys causing many typos.My typing accuracy has improved and I love the look of it. I love it enough that I got 2, one for home and the office. It is a great buy and I would recommend it.",

The keyboard is super cute and goes perfectly with the Cinnamoroll theme I have for my desk! Keys are much quieter than my previous mechanical keyboard (razer huntsman) but feel nice to press, some slight lag when typing quickly for more than 10 or so seconds but not really bothersome.The mouse, for me, wasn't useable. There was too much lag when moving across the screen and the clicks weren't precise, used it for about 20 minutes and even playing solitaire was a little frustrating so I turned it off. Luckily the keyboard works just fine with the mouse turned off, so you can use them separately! I expected to not be able to use the mouse, since I also use this computer for gaming and didn't think a wireless mouse would work out, so still happy to have the cute keyboard.",

                "reviewText": "Aesthetic and looks:When I first saw this keyboard I really liked the look and aesthetic of it and in person, it's exactly as it looked in the picture. I loved the sound the keys made and the feel of the actual keys on my hand as it felt exactly like a typewriter,Practicality:This is where overall I give it a 3. I wish I could give it a 3.5 as it wasn't a bad keyboard. It was nice, it looked and sounded amazing but it was slow to respond when I typed and it can slow down my machine. (However, I'm not sure if it's my machine or the product but when I tested it on another keyboard my machine was the same in responsiveness. I have a Macbook Pro) and there is no on/off function. It does have a sleep mode however it can be a little difficult to determine the sleep mode but when in use again after sleep mode it does respond fairly quickly.For my personal preference, however, the keys are a little close together which slowed down my writing and caused numerous mistakes that I later fixed. It's not a huge problem (barely a problem really I would just mention it) but it's more a personal preference.Overall it wasn't a bad keyboard and it can be excellent for casual usage and even professional use if you don't mind the close keys. (Really I'm being picky) and it would be an excellent piece to add to your desk however if you plan to use this keyboard heavily (I'm an author) it can slow you down and if you don't constantly use it, the keyboard will go to sleep on you and you have to move the mouse around or tap a few keys to 'wake it up'. Overall nice product but not for me.",
