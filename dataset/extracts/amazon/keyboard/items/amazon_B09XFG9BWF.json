                "reviewText": "11/10/2023 final update.About all I can give any praise on is the colors.Update. Dropping this to two stars. Keypad letters wearing off already. Great for typing if you don't need to see the letters or numbers. The product is great for my work, because I do have to use the keyboard all day long. I have only had this product for just two or three weeks but it is already wearing out on the N and E keys.",
