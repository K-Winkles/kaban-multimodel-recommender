The varying shades of pink give it a unique and eye-catching look that adds a touch of personality to my workspace. The keys have a soft click clack sound that is not too obnoxious, making typing a pleasant experience.One of the standout features of this keyboard is its responsiveness. The keys are highly responsive. This is important for someone like me who types a lot throughout the day.I love that it is wireless which gives me the freedom to move around without having to connect via a cord. An extra perk is that the keyboard comes with a bonus mouse that is equally comfortable to use.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my keyboard, if you looking for something cute for your desk, I suggest giving this a try!",

The mouse fits great in my hand (on the smaller side) and has a nice shape. All the keys are relatively quiet and have a nice click to them - my only complaint is depending on where you hit the space bar it is MUCH louder than the other keys. I usually have headphones on when typing for long periods but I can see some people would find this frustrating. If you're looking for something quiet, this is not it.",
