                "reviewText": "After the few days of using it, my impressions are way beyond my expectations before I bought it! it's so well made and typing on it feels so pleasant. It's sounds kind of muffled and even quiet, like when you close car doors. For me it's the Rolls-Royce of keyboards, and what surprised me it's reaction times are so fast, that I can tell and I didn't even realize that you can notice this with keyboard. I've used cherry reds, blacks and my recent one was a kailh brown and in comparison all of them are in my opinion a piece of old tech junk. If it passes the test of time I might even buy myself a backup one. There are some people that complain about the red switches being to soft, but I really like them and I'm glad there's no bump like with browns, its so much easier for my fingers. I wouldn't even mind them to be softer but as it is is spot on. In one word this keyboard is perfect in my view. In the beginning I didn't like the volume scroll wheel as it's not gripping well enough but I just use it differently, than on my previous keyboard, I'm grabbing with two fingers.",

I settled on this board, and its really been an eye opener on just how great a high quality keyboard can be! What I thought was the biggest question on whether I should get this board, the snow switches, turned out to probably be the best feature. Silky silky smooth, I had contemplated immediately getting some Gateron silent switches, but I like the snow so much I am not going to be changing any time soon, they are fairly quiet and again... so smoooooth. I haven't used the wireless yet, but I'm OK with a wired board (but fully intend to use the wireless, which Asus is supposed to have a very low latency wireless).The only thing I can find to criticize is that the secondary characters on the keycaps (like the parenthesis under the 9 and the 0) are kind of hard to see in the dark, they don't illuminate very well. Otherwise I am really loving this board, well worth the sales price, will update in a year with how long it lasts!!!",

                "reviewText": "I didn't buy for gaming, I'm a software engineer and use my computer all day.Keys are very nice, not too loud, build quality seems greaat so far. I was impressed with the weight of it when first unboxing. I didn't install the software so I can't speak to that. The lighting is fine, I don't really care about that.My biggest annoyance is that it being a 96% keyboard some of the numpad buttons are dual-purposed and you toggle them with the numlock key, but its not always apparent if numlock is on or not, so I'll hit the 7 thinking it will operate as the home button to get a 7... Same thing with the 1/end. So it will cause me to pause for a second when typing to think about what it will actually do. That being said, this is a smaller deal on an otherwise pretty good keyboard.",

                "reviewText": "Nice keyboard, good key press feel. Really like the back lighting for the keys. I typically use it connected via USB cable so I can keep the background lighting bright and not worry about running down the battery. When on battery, the back lighting is somewhat dim which is expected, otherwise the battery would not last very long. Only complaint is the two LEDs under the space key are directly visible when looking at the keyboard from an angle other than almost directly above the keyboard.",

                "reviewText": "My first thoughts on this new keyboard: The keys are very sensitive. I have never considered myself to be a supreme typist but I do like the feel of the keys. They don't click nearly as much as my last Razer Blackwidow Ult keyboard, which was very loud. I prefer the stealthy operation of this keyboard but I did love the feeling of the clicky keyboard. In due time I will get used to this keyboard but until then it's going to take some getting effort to adjust.Some things I like are as follows; the keys are incredibly smooth, the clicking sound they produce is not necessarily connected to the keys actuation and that has caused me to frequently press the keys while resting my hands. With the clicky keyboard this was not a problem as you could feel the click threshold, allowing me to rest my fingers on the keys without accidental misfires. I feel like the clicky style keyboard is probably better for productivity.My conclusions:Key press is incredibly smoothSmoothness leads to mis-firesVery quietI have big slender-ish hands and have no issues finding the right keysTakes up much less real estate on my deskRGB looks greatBuild quality and unboxing exp. is top shelfI have the wireless connected through a hub and there is no discernible delay or lagIf I could have my click feel with the sound and smoothness of this keyboard it would be perfect. Easily worth the price!",
