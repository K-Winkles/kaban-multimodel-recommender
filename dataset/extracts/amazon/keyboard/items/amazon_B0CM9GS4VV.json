                "reviewText": "Update: customer service reached out after seeing my review and offered me a new set free. I ended up declining because I only wanted the mouse and they couldn't separate the set. They were very interested in \"making it right\" but in the end it was just a customer/product mismatch. But it does give me confidence to say, that if you have any issues they will be fast to respond and correct the issue.Original review: I ended up returning this for a couple of reasons, but the main one is that the color (purple) was not the pale lavender shown online or even on box, but instead an almost pink purple that looked like hot pink next to my purple set up.Other issues were:* forward and back buttons on the mouse were reversed (not intentionally, clearly based on the manual)* when mouse entered sleep mode, waking it up required turning it off and on again* media control function keys didn't work* no off button on keyboard (would make cleaning it a nightmare)There were a couple things I did like, however:* quiet click of the mouse. I normally like noisy accessories but the quiet was nice. Made me wish the keyboard was a little quiet because the juxtaposition was strange.* keyboard typed nicely. used it less than 10 hours after delivery to work from home and had no problem getting the grove of using it. It's a good size for me and I usually use the logitech wave (K350)* ergonomic fit of the mouse. seriously felt so good in my hand, I made sure to buy a similar one with the set I got to replace this one even though that set also comes with its own mouse.Overall, I don't NOT recommend it, but I don't eagerly say run out and get one asap. It's not bad for the price and takes little to no learning curve to use.",
