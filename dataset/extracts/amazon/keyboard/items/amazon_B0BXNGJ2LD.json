I occasionally play games on it so the WASD keys are faded and worn but for general use it is very good. I had issues with Rii mice but their keyboards are perfectly fine.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this keyboard because my previous one was losing its responsiveness and the labels were coming off some of the keys. This one was great at first and still works well 5 months after buying it. It's quiet, the keys have good \"travel\" when pressed, and it seems quite responsive and accurate overall. I really like the extra media keys at the top, especially the volume/mute keys. The one key that I miss from a previous keyboard is the Calculator shortcut key, but that's minor and very specific to my own preference.Unfortunately within 3 months, the labels started coming off of at least 4 different keys. Too late for a return. I worry that it'll get worse over time, so I've already been browsing for a replacement and won't buy this specific model again. But overall it's a pretty good basic keyboard for the price.",
