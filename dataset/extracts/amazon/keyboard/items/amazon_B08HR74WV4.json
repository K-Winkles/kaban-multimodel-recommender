                "reviewText": "What I mean by the title is that this keyboard is for a specific group of people. Off the bat, this thing is EXPENSIVE! It is the priciest keyboard I saw when browsing, but given my preferences and my love for Corsair, I had to have it. It is also a laptop style keyboard, or that is to say that it use Ultra Low Profile (ULP) Tactile Switches from Cherry. The keys are thin, and have a very low actuation distance. It's wireless via dongle or Bluetooth, and comes with a very nice black USB-C cable. It is thin, sleek, and beautiful in my opinion. I love the way the keys feel, look, and type. Overall it is the best keyboard on the market for me, and the one I use. I just think it could have done a couple of things differently, or even had an upgraded model(read further).Looks-wise, this is it. The thickest part of this keyboard is smaller than the thinnest part of my previous k70 LUX. I took a few moments to revel in that upon unboxing. The RGB is gorgeous, but doesn't have what I have come to see as 'obnoxious' backlighting. The font of the keys is so much better than my k70. These have a professional look to them, and even with the RGB it doesn't scream 'gamer!', even though it may satiate that look to those looking for it. It matches my full RGB PC 'gamer' setup very well. The brushed aluminum is gorgeous. They fumbled not using it for the keycaps as well. For the price? Come on. It would have an even more impressive shine and it would have such a luxurious feel, possibly staying colder and reducing sweat while improving grip(Corsair I would love to work on your design team ;). Other reviewers were talking about making the bottom metal as well. I don't really care with that. The screen is beautiful, but why can't I change the status LED colors, only the logo. Almost three hundred dollars. Small miss but these are the things you look for when you buy this type of keyboard. The brightness settings look good as well.It was easy to use and set up, but might be because I am very familiar with iCUE. Assuming this would be your only slipstream device and you download iCUE prior to plugging the keyboard in, setting it up would probably be pretty easy for anyone. The wireless dongle works very well as long as it is plugged in to a USB 3.0 port or better. Wired mode works great of course.I personally love the iCUE software. I love Corsair and I think iCUE is rightfully considered at the forefront of proprietary RGB tech. The keyboard was easy to set up and integrate, and it works so well. The keyboard has tons of profile slots for wired profiles and 2 for hardware slots. Some people seem to think that only the hardware profiles work in wireless mode. This is not true. You just have to set another lighting layer in your profile for wireless mode, which is only available to be edited in wireless mode. Vice Versa with wired mode editing. This is the only quirk I have encountered to date. Wired switches instantly with the profile button but wireless takes 2-3 seconds. Not ideal but I can live with it. Overall I love iCUE and it works well with the K100 Air.Now, my qualms and an idea. This keyboard is so thin. I said that as a positive earlier, and it is, but after a while of using this on my desk, it became a negative sometimes. Not to say I dislike the actual key and switch size, but the keyboard occasionally comes across as too low to the surface. Like I got a 3/4in book and set the keyboard on there and I liked how it felt a lot. It would be cool if Corsair could make, or include(price, again) some sort of mount you can sit the keyboard on to raise it up. Second, Corsair blew an opportunity not including Nexus into the screen on this keyboard. I'm gonna be mad when it comes out for the next generation right after I buy this one, but I digress. The screen on this one is cool and looks good, but the plastic cover is awful and being unable to change the indicator light colors is just bad.Corsair should have either incorporated Nexus into this keyboard, or had the option for a \"K100 Air Pro\" with the Nexus for slightly more.Overall, I love this keyboard. It fits my style. The reason I said to buy it if it is what you want, is because this keyboard won't appeal to the type of person who likes a thick mechanical keyboard, blaring RGB, and their clicks as loud as possible. This is more lowkey and function oriented for typing. The ULP switches are slightly but noticeably quieter than the Cherry MX Red's I had on the K70 LUX. The RGB does not light up my desk like the K70. This is a very subjective pro. It is so thin. Subjectively a pro and a con at times. ULP switches are another subjective pro. What I am getting at is that except for the couple grievances I had, I love this keyboard. This keyboard performs how it set out to. It is up to you to figure out if that is what you want. It IS what I want, and I appreciate how well it achieves that. Overall a 5/5 for me, and Corsair, I always have more product and design ideas.",

                "reviewText": "I do a lot of typing for my job, so I don't mind spending a little on keyboards for the quality of life improvements they bring, but I've found it surprisingly hard to find keyboards that I really love. In the past I've looked for keyboards with backlit keys, which makes it easy to spot keys at a glance, and Cherry MX switches because of the more satisfying tactile feedback they give. But even among those higher end keyboards there were always little things that bugged me. Up until very recently, for example, I used a Corsair K95 keyboard. Great key visibility in all lighting and excellent macro capabilities, but the sensitivity of the keys was too high for me. I'd constantly find myself accidentally brushing a macro key or typing double keys because I pressed a millisecond too long, but I put up with it because it was kind of the best I could find with the features I was looking for. But then last week I was careless and knocked over a can of sparkling water and it zapped my K95 so I hopped on Amazon and bought what I initially thought was the same keyboard. When it arrived however, I discovered it was actually a newer keyboard in their line, the K100.I plugged it in and started typing a couple of paragraphs of stream of consciousness just to get a feel for it and almost immediately realized something major had changed in the new version. The keys have the same great visibility from the backlight, the same or maybe even slightly better tactile feedback with the new OPX optical switches, but the sensitivity is tuned to almost exactly what I would consider optimal. Responsive to every intentional keypress but forgiving of accidental brushes. I freaking love it. I love it so much I just bought it again to keep as a backup for the next time I act like an idiot and forget the no drinks on the desk rule.Keyboards are surprisingly personal to people, some people have found ways to keep using keyboards manufactured 40 years ago because they can't stand the feel of more modern designs, so I can't guarantee you'll love what I love about this keyboard. But I can tell you the feel of typing on it is buttery smooth, the aluminum case is solid feeling and stiff, the sound and tactile feedback of keypresses is very satisfying, and it seems to all be calibrated to be sensitive but not too sensitive. If you have the budget, I'd highly recommend giving it a try.",

The optical switches are super fast and easy to press, however will take a little time to get use to as you do not have to press hardly at all before they registar the key stroke.The RGB blights are very bright a crystal clear... however they are not to bight or distracting.The ICUE softwear is the best program for a keyboard that I have used to date and I have used alot of programs that have come with keyboards to program the extra keys. It will take a few minutes to figure out however, once you do you will have your extra prorgramable \"G\" keys set up to your liken for marcos or to open programs that you use the most.Over all I love the build quality of the keyboard in general, but i love how soild they keys are and how easy they are to press. Your fingers will like it to at the end of the day if you do alot of gaming or typing.I Highly suggest this keyboard... it will last a very long time.Lastly, there is a USB pass through port on the front of the keyboard for extra device to plug in such as game pad, head phone, webcam or ect.the ICUE wheel control is amazing detail also that lets you do verious things as well.10 out of 10 rating on this soild and amazing keyboards.",
