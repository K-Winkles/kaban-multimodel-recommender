I tried using the regular Keychron K4 with red switches, but I found the keys to be a bit mushy and too easy to press, causing typos. This keyboard from RK is much better; the yellow switches feel way more consistent but still smooth, and it is really appreciated that they have space between the numpad and enter key, which I constantly had problems with on the K4. The keyboard is light, but still feels solid which could make it good for travel. The volume wheel is also such a nice bonus! The only reason why I returned it was because I use the home, end, pg up, and pg down keys alot, so I decided to get a full-sized keyboard.If you are looking for a 96% keyboard however, you WILL NOT be disappointed!",

Gotta say I'm massivly impressed, I'm still not a fan of the type of switches but it is a very smooth, chuncky sound...IDK how to explain it but it sound delicious ;)I was looking for a possible replacement for my Corsair Strafe RGB mk.2 because sodering is a pain to replace the keys. This boards switches are slighty stiffer which I do like in comparason to the Cherry MX Reds, The reds caused constant miss-types due to the sensitive accuation, perfect for gaming but not typing.Overall I just wish this came with a Doubleshot keycap because it is difficult to see in a dark room. I'm happy with this in comparason to what I had and may have found that replacement I was looking for.",

Please enjoy the first person perspective of me typing this review. I hope it is satisfying. The clicks are super nice. To anyone wondering how I achieved this cinematic masterpiece, I simply tucked my phone right into my pants. It worked nicely, I think. I am recording as I type so I haven't seen the footage yet.

                "reviewText": "Note: I'm not a mechanical keyboard enthusiast. My review is based on my own personal experience.For starters, I really like the RK yellow switches that come with this keyboard. It has a nice tactile feel on all buttons and the sound that each keypress produces is satisfying to my ears. I am currently using this plugged in, but I have also tried the 2.4G wireless mode and it was also good. What I am really impressed by with this keyboard though is how compact it is for the 96 key form factor. After daily driving my DROP TKL keyboard for a few years, I was surprised to find that this is almost the same size as that keyboard. The switches are hot-swappable, so you can replace them with most of the 3 pin or 5 pin mechanical switches out there.As for some of the drawbacks, the wrist rest is not great and should either be replaced with a good quality one (like the GMK wooden wrist rest) or just not used entirely. The build quality of this keyboard is not as premium as my DROP keyboard, but that's a given considering the price and it doesn't feel like cheap plastic was used here.Overall, I'm actually quite pleased with this keyboard. I would recommend this as a great starter mechanical keyboard.",
