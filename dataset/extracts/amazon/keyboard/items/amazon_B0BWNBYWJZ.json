Connectivity was plug and play simple. Only downside is that of you need to travel with you wireless set often the keyboard doesn't have an on off switch like the mouse so some inputs may be pressed when packed in a travel bag.

The positive thing I can say with the keyboard is the soft touch of the keys and its quiet. There is no light to indicate if you are typing in lower case or upper case which is a definite drawback. The other thing is the wireless mouse, it just stinks. Not a good feel and you have to drape your whole hand over it to get a click. I got rid of it and went back to my wireless Logitech mini. All in all, it is a good keyboard and I'm happy with it.",

                "reviewText": "The first one I received was DOA. Neither the mouse nor keyboard functioned but the USB receiver worked fine with Windows 11. Put the brand new Duracell batteries on my tester and they were fine. Amazon shipped me another one which does work. The battery light on the keyboard doesn't illuminate and the mouse led doesn't light up so you can't tell if they do work or not except trying them.I thought the keyboard and mouse worked OK, until I learned that the keyboard will go to sleep overnight, and there is no way to wake it up without removing a battery so I changed my rating from 3 to 1 star. I have never had a keyboard with such a thoughtless design.",

                "reviewText": "The keyboard has no light above the numbers to tell you if the number or capital letter locks are on. I keep my num lock on all of the time and if I mistakenly shut it off and start typing numbers, I wind up all over the spreadsheets I am working on. Without the little light, one could resolve the problem sooner than later. In addition, I am finding it tends to duplicate keystrokes and sometimes the space bar does not hit. I am a fast typer and generally very accurate. The keyboard is not loud, but not silent either. I prefer a smoother and more quiet keyboard. Still considering returning it. I am less happy and more not happy with it. It's got some quirks that bother me. As you can see, the sentence ending with 'happy in it' has only one space after the period. I use two. I hit it twice, but did not get the 2 spaces. Often it happens with words connecting together as well.",
