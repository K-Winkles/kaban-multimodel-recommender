                "reviewText": "Well it\u2019s a cheap RGB keyboard that does its job so for $14 bucks I\u2019m not really gonna complain. The only cons I see are:There\u2019s no way to adjust the \u201cmode\u201d of the backlights, just the brightness of the lights. You can\u2019t change it to just one color or have different patterns.I\u2019m not sure if the bottom part is supposed to be a wrist-rest, but it\u2019s huge and honestly inconvenient. I\u2019d rather not have it there at all.The phone holder is useless if you have any kind of case on your phone.Again for the price, if you want an RGB keyboard with zero customization and a gigantic wrist wrest, this will work just fine. Might be worth spending the few extra dollars on another board if you care about customizing and having a keyboard that takes up less real estate.",
