                "reviewText": "--X9: I am very pleased with this X9 Ergonomic Performance Wired Keyboard. It is a less known brand and there are not many online video reviews, but it exceeded my expectations! The build quality is good enough, but of course not on the level of some mechanical keyboards. The keys are quiet when you type, which I prefer. The layout is close enough to the old MS Natural Keyboards from the 1990s, to make adjustment easy, and I like how the keys close to the center (like T-G-H-N) are wider. It has the little notches on the F and J keys which are a must for me, as I do not need to look at the keyboard when typing. It has some texture on the key surfaces, so your fingers do not easily slip off.Pressing the FN+ESC, lets you access operating system functions like Volume Mute on F11, which is quite useful; and a Windows Calculator toggle above the numpad.--Adesso: I also have a comparably priced, Adesso Ergonomic Wired Keyboard, which I also like, but when I first bought it, the Backspace Key would sometimes not respond; it has a smoother key surface (therefore not as firm of a finger hold), and noisier when you type. The build quality is also a little lower than the X9, but it gets the job done. The hands placement is more squished in and angled than the X9.--X9: Overall, I would highly recommend this affordable keyboard for daily: office use, internet browsing and casual gaming. Thank you X9 Company for making this simple, functional, affordable, responsive, comfortable and satisfying: wired ergonomic keyboard!",

                "reviewText": "08/25/23 - Update - Very happy with this keyboard. I wear hearing aids and my old (and abused)keyboard made a tremendous racket. I quickly adapted to this specific layout and other than missingmy center keys on the 4000, this has been a very good purchase with a convention layout. No weirdkeys in strange places.With a great deal of regret, I was forced to replace my 9 year old MS 4000 Natural Keyboard, which Microsoft discontinued years ago. They are still available, but sellers are asking $800 !!! for NEW models. I simply won't play that game. Used ones are always a gamble My own keyboard had millions upon millions of keystrokes and was falling to pieces. It also was deafening when I was doing high speed typing. With a hearing aid, the racket was insufferable.So, after giving up my pursuit of a new MS 4000, I stumbled across this very inexpensive similar style keyboard. This model has a split space bar which takes a minute to get used to, but after a couple days I'm back up to my usual speeds. The key touch is very soft which my cracked finger tips love.Even under a full on ten fingers of doom assault, this keyboard remains amazingly quiet. Perfect if you share a room with others. The cord connector is standard 5' long USB. I did not find a wireless model which I would have preferred.The palm wrest pad feels very high quality and hopefully will hold up for a very long time. The overall footprint is about the same length as the MS 4000, but the width is about 20% smaller, which on my TIny Desk (tm) frees up some much needed room. The layout itself is bog standard, so you have a middle group that handles the nav keys and a right group that is a standard keypad. No funky, weird layouts.Standard complement of 12 F keys that do double duty. Status lights are very small and discrete, and nicely located at the top of the keyboard. They are not obnoxiously bright like other keyboards, and the placement makes it a snap to see key status. The keys are a comfortable size with a tactile feel. Travel length is good.All in all, I am really liking this keyboard. So much so that I may want to buy another one for when I inevitably kill this new one. You can also raise the back of the keyboard, which makes it easier to type on.As a person with a very big rib cage, I simply cannot use any other style of keyboard. I look forward to years of use with this pup. Definitely a five star rating. Does anyone want to buy my small wireless MS Keyboard + Mouse????",

                "reviewText": "My initial review is that this is a nice keyboard. It certainly seems as though it will fill the void left by the MS Ergonomic Keyboard 4000. The key strokes are soft and quiet. It aligns nicely with my normal hand resting position. Just a couple of initial cons. The wrist rest is going to wear out way before the rest of this keyboard. I have been using it for roughly 20 minutes, and there are already indentations where my palms sit. While the keys are super quite, I do miss the affirmative action of keys with a slightly stronger stroke requirement. I do miss having the spacebar go all the way across the lower keys, but that is not a deal breaker for me. My biggest concern really is the wrist rest. While it is very comfortable, I am not sure it is suitably more comfortable than just a hard plastic keyboard in relation to knowing that I will likely get a lot less use from the keyboard due to it wearing out faster. My guess is years less use to be honest. But that is pure speculation.Good keyboard. Worth the money. Happy with my purchase. So far.EDIT: 1 Year Later. I stand corrected on the wrist rest. It has held up very well. The initial indentations are there, but they did not get bigger or worse. It's almost like it is memory foam, though it is clearly not. I wish I could raise my rating to 4.5 Stars. I still like the more affirmative key strokes that the MS keyboard required, but all in all an excellent keyboard. Assuming quality has been maintained by the manufacturer, I would recommend this keyboard to anyone looking for a good ergonomic design.",
