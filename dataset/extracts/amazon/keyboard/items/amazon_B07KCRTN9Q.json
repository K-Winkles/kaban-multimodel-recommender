                "reviewText": "Disclaimer: I have very limited knowledge when it comes to mechanical keyboards \u2013 I\u2019ve only dedicated about 4 hours of my time researching on Reddit (you guys at /r/MechanicalKeyboards), where there are enthusiasts who would spend hundreds on highly customizable keyboards, whether it had high quality LEDs, unique key-cap designs, swappable switches, bread cable\u2026 all of the cool things that we, internal-geeks find awesome, even erotic.If you\u2019re like me though, I name a price (typically a budget price\u2026) and stick with it\u2026 It was $50\u2026 Now, some of you will claim that a sub-$50 mechanical keyboard aren't worth it at all \u2013 While I may have never had a mechanical keyboard before, I\u2019ll admit that I would not the best person to be judging the product but I do hope my below review and pictures will help you decide whether you want to try a Redragon brand keyboard which is getting some attention as the cheap entry keyboard to mechanical keyboards on Amazon\u2026I will be reviewing the Redragon K582 Surara (red switches) ($39 after coupon) based on the board\u2019s quality / presentation, performance, noise, and features. All Pictures/gifs are found here.Just a heads up before we jump into each of the topics, I wanted mention that I was looking for a keyboard that had a number keypad. If I didn't want the number keypad, I would have gotten a smaller keyboard without the number keypad.I also decided to buy from Amazon based on the fact that I can return the keyboard for free, and therefore, this review is purely based on my opinion.Board quality / presentation (4/5): I am pleasantly surprised how sturdy the board feels. The plastic around the board feels thick and doesn't have the \u201cbendy\u201d vibe to the board as you press keys against the board. It certainly weights a bit which actually works very well with the \u201cstanding legs\u201d on the back of the board as the weight presses the legs against the table. I had conceived an theory when I purchased this keyboard that the keyboard would slip back as I play CS:GO given that there is not a lot of rubber feet on the back of the board, but after 24 hours of gaming on this keyboard, it never once slipped.The key-caps are \u201calright\u201d - they don\u2019t impress me but they do the job just fine, especially with transparency on the letters allowing the LED lights shine through. When I take the key-caps off, I can see them being a little flimsy but while sitting on the red switches, I don\u2019t find them flimsy. However, when I have my finger on the top of the key-caps, I can wiggle the key-cap ever so slightly in all directions, just barely touching other keys \u2013 it is not as sturdy as I hoped and therefore taking a point off.Switch Performance (5/5 gaming, 4/5 typing): After learning about switch types and quality of different brands (cherry, Outemu, etc) I was on the fence between the Browns and Reds switches since I knew I\u2019d be gaming more often than typing (boring emails)\u2026 Ultimately went with reds after reading that they are great for gaming and that the browns may not be comfortable for gaming. After gaming and typing on this keyboard, I can see what others are saying about the difference between brown and reds\u2026 I would have found it annoying to have soft tactical feedback as I press the key during gaming but I think I would have appreciate the feedback for typing as it would be nice to know that the key registered without a second thought.For gaming, it has been amazing, I think I\u2019ve noticed a up-tick of gaming performance but that could be due to\u2026 just playing a lot :) Never once I felt/thought like the keys didn't register but that's probably because I play with claw hand shapes pressing down harshly all the time. It is certainly a major upgrade from using membrane keyboards over the last decade.If you are looking for a keyboard that is more geared towards writing, definitely check out a keyboard with brown or blue switches\u2026 depending on your noise tolerance. Which brings me to my next part on noise.Noise (3.5/5): Blues have a reputation for being great for typing but can be noisy with its clacking sounds on each key-press so people tend to recommend browns. I was sure about buying the browns until I learned that the reds are quiet just like the browns without the tactical feedback. The reds still produce a clacky noise. I am not sure if its because I am not use to keyboards making noise but I can definitely hear every key-stroke on this keyboard \u2013 sounds like due to my fingers pressing the keys all the way to the floor of the keyboard. It\u2019s not noticeable when I am listening to music or playing CS:GO.Features \u2013 LEDs (4/5): There aren\u2019t many features that separates this keyboard from superior keyboards such as Ducky \u2013 it has all of the typical features that should come with keyboards by default.It has the typical plastic cable, nice see-through key-caps with\u2026 wait what? LEDs?! I\u2019ll admit, I never really cared for LEDs on keyboards, let alone having the \u201cgamers\u201d theme that comes with the LEDs. After using this keyboard with LEDs, specifically on \u201csolid color\u201d lighting mode, I have grown to love it\u2026 it brings out the young me. That being said, I only have it on a \u201csolid color\u201d mode because all of the other lighting modes are very distracting. The colors are: green, Blue, deep purple, purple, \u201cwhite\u201d (comes off as very light purple), rainbow, red, orange and yellow. There light modes include the Wave, press-key, press-key wave, press-key \u201cgrid line\u201d, \u201crainbow\u201d wave\u2026 and many more than I could care to find out. At the end of the day, the solid color is my default mode as it is the least distracting to me.TL:DR; (4/5) For a mechanical keyboard in the sub-$40 category, it is a great product which I deem as a great entry keyboard for those who are testing the waters and \u201cjust need a keyboard that's better than membrane keyboards\u201d. The quality of the keyboard is firm, the red switches feel great during gaming and \u2018alright\u2019 for typing, the noise is there but not annoying when headphones are on, and the LEDs is a cool feature to have.I would recommend this to a friend, unless they had a larger budget.",

                "reviewText": "Edit Edit - July of 2023. I have not changed out a switch in a very long time and this thing is SOLID. I still use it for daily work and then switch it to my home PC for personal use and gaming - and even my WASD keys are not needing swapping out. I love love love this keyboard, and never thought it would last this long! This is totally worth the investment and I will be purchasing this brand (and probably model?) again if I need another keyboard.Edit: Purchased this in Feb 2020 - it is now Sep of 2022, and this keyboard is flawless. I had a hiccup with my first one, where I had to swap out switches that went out unreasonably fast. They had me try a few things, and then sent me a brand new one. This new one has been working flawlessly since then. I have ZERO complaints. My keycaps are not even losing any definition, all keys work perfectly, and I use it on the daily for both work and after-work gaming. It gets beaten on slightly from gaming, and I type a lot for my job, and this has held up perfectly. I may have swapped out a switch or two over the last 2 years, but I still have plenty of spares from the original kit. This was a FANTASTIC buy that I do not regret in the slightest. The only modification I made was to get the tiny silicon o-rings to dampen the sound. Great buy, WOULD recommend, 10/10I never really cared to upgrade to a mechanical keyboard. I didn't really see the point, and for sure didn't care for the extra noise. I am converted now, but this isn't really about the perks and benefits of mechanical vs standard.This was a budget keyboard, I think I got it for just under 50$. It is very well made, has extra switches and a key puller, and they keys are not too high to get irritating. I was looking for an RGB keyboard with per-key individual programming, and this one has it. You can set up customized colors for each key, which is amazing. But even without the software, the included schemes and patterns are INCREDIBLE. They seamlessly fade from color to color, and you can speed up or slow them down as you wish. There are some that are reactive, that speed up as you type quickly. There are some that have the keyboard dark until you type, and either the individual key lights up, or a single row wave shoots away from your keypresses, or a wave cascades out across the keyboard. There are some that just stay on, some that slowly fade across the board, some that are random on each key and they fade and change colors subtly. It's ridiculously gorgeous, and responsive. As a keyboard on its own it is VERY sturdy, and easy to type on - I am ruined for regular keyboards from here on out.This is a great buy for anyone looking for an actual RGB keyboard with individual lighting. 10/10 would buy againEdit: Bought this at the end of Feb, it is now May 11th, and my 'W' key started acting wonky. I'd have to hold it down longer when gaming, and it hesitated from time to time. It is probably my most commonly used gaming key, and commonly used in typing as well, so I guess it makes sense. They did provide swappable switches to replace it with, and having done so, I played a few rounds and it does seem to be resolved.Additionally, this is *not* a loud keyboard in and of itself, but the keys hitting the bottom is where the noise comes into play. This can get noisy - but I bought some O-rings after reading that someone else had tried it, and am pleasantly surprised with the results. It feels the same, and has a muted sound. I am still really really happy with this keyboard, and am just hoping that the failed switch was a one off.Edit - June 12thI still love this keyboard. But BUT! I have used my spare switches, and may need to be ordering more. I keep having keys that are 'going out'. They don't stop working entirely, but sometimes need to be held down, or hesitate before activating. It has happened with the 'W' key, the 'S' key (which both make it quite difficult for gaming) and now my 'n' key is giving me a hard time. I love this keyboard, and am not sure if it is just a normal thing, but my old membrane keyboard never did this. I am contacting Redragon to see if anything can be done. I hesitate to knock more stars off, but this is a solid keyboard besides this, and I have only had it 3.5 months at this point.Fingers crossed!Edit: June 20th, 2020Customer support was fast, efficient, and really seemed to care. They were prompt and took care of my issues. I love my keyboard, and am super happy with this purchase. Returning this review to its 5 star status, as it is a superior product, and the customer service more than made up for the flaws in my first one.Thank you, Redragon!!!",

This mechanical keyboard is something entirely else than the usual \"pudding\" keys you get with lesser keyboards. Also, I quite like the lighting - a must for my ageing eyes!I had an issue with the NumPad 5 key and after reporting it, the Redragon support immediately sent me a set of replacement switches. As it turned out, the problem was not the switch for the key 5, so Redragon sent me a brand new keyboard at once. The new keyboard is working perfectly and of all keyboards that I am regularly using (four of them), the K582 SURARA is a firm favourite.Redragon support is second to none and I'd like to thank them for their responsiveness and assistance! They are knowledgeable and willing to help.Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "Been using this as my 'daily driver' for the last few months of work from home. Great keyboard! Tons of features like all the different lightning profiles. There's even a software.exe you can download from the redragon website for this guy to go through the different ones (with names -- that helps). Weighed at the bottom too, so it doesn't slide around my wood-top desk. Feels like an additional 5-6 lbs at the bottom, so compared to my usual membrane keyboard, this has a solid, tactile rigidity to it that you just can't get from the cheapies. Keys are all bright, elegantly lit and have that awe-inducing clickety-clack sound on each keypress. Just a marvelous design, and at this price, it is a seriously great value for your dollar.I'd recommend a wrist rest, to elevate your hands a little bit to match the angle. It did take me at least a month to really get used to the keys. This is not a flaw of the product, it's a matter of familiarity if you've been stuck with cheap manufacturer membrane keyboards for years!Also, there's no mention of this but you can customize the color of each individual key by using 'FN+~'. Cycle through that til you get your desired color, then press a key. It's that easy!**Update 04-25-2021**This keyboard died on me about 6 months after purchasing from Amazon.ca store. I was bummed out. After getting into contact with Redragonshop (don't reach out to redragonzone -- that doesn't seem to go anywhere), they asked I provide a short video of what I was experiencing. After I sent off the video, they shipped me a new keyboard, and instructed me to toss the old one. This was all over about 2 days!!! Usually RMA takes weeks with different vendors. Would buy Redragon again!",
