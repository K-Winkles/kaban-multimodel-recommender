Have to plug in and charge each night. Ugh.UPDATE 10/27/23: Keys are glitchy, even when keeping plugged in 24/7. Sometimes non-responsive, other times TOO responsive and types multiples of the key pressed only once. Looking for a different keyboard now - too late to return so I though I would warn everyone.",

                "reviewText": "Battery life on the keyboard isn\u2019t super long, but I love that both the mouse and keyboard are rechargeable so I\u2019m not blowing through batteries. I have the little charging cord plugged into the surge protector on my desk so I can easily plug them in when needed. They can still be used while plugged in and charging, which is nice, because I use these for work. The mouse seems to last a little longer, even though I use it way more than the keyboard. But so far, other than the battery life, I really like these! The mouse is really slim which took me some time to get used to, but it\u2019s very responsive and has an auto-sleep feature when it\u2019s idle for a few minutes, and you just have to click to wake it up. The only thing I don\u2019t love is the \u201cWIN\u201d and \u201cMAC\u201d buttons being literally right above the 10-key pad. I type by touch and rarely actually look at the keyboard so I have accidentally hit the \u201cMAC\u201d button a couple times and disabled my keyboard function in the middle of working. Kind of inconvenient, wish the placement of those buttons was a little different, but other than that I really love both pieces.",
