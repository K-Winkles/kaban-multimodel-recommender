                "reviewText": "Recently my keyboard that I bought in 2021 from Best Buy has not been connecting at times and stop working in the middle of using it. It can be a shortage of battery, I don\u2019t know since we can\u2019t tell the battery life in the keyboards. I ordered a replacement for my keyboard from Amazon on 11/24/23. The keyboard was in great condition and appeared to be perfect. However, to notice 3 buttons was not working on the replacement keyboard, the (M) (,) and (.) keys were not working. I started a replacement of this item on 11/28/23 and was given an ETA for delivery for 12/1/23. Lucky me, I got a surprise notification saying my item will be arriving earlier than expected. I got my replacement of my Amazon order on 11/30/23. Let me say\u2026.. \u201cAround of Applause\u201d this merchant shipped the item fast and sent an item that is dang near brand new. The Apple box has slight dirty marks, not bothersome and I wiped it with a Clorox wipe for any germs. Then, upon opening the box, the product was wrapped in the frosted film like a new product would be. It included the apple literature, but without the Apple stickers..whomp whomp!!! Can\u2019t have it all for a \u201cRenewed\u201d item. But hey\u2026.We are in the game. Per the pictures, the item is free of damages and stains and works like new. Strange moment, it even smells new. Hahahaha. I connected my iPad Pro with no issues and did a test type of all characters on the keyboard and they ALL work\u2026 I wiped down the exterior and keys with a bleach wipe and lightly mist the entire keyboard with Lysol spray, the Air version for protection from germs since I am not the original owner. I will definitely order from this merchant again, if need to.",

Of course, the keyboard and track pad are ultra responsive. It all feels like a premium product, as it should. Don't settle for the cheaper versions of this if you have the option.

I never buy refurbished/renewed tech but I didn't feel like paying retail for a new Magic Keyboard for my iPad Pro. So I took a gamble on this.It came with the original box, packaging, and documents. The box was a bit damaged but nothing terrible. I was pleasantly surprised by how clean the Magic Keyboard was and it definitely looked like new. As soon as I connected my iPad Pro to it, it started working without issues.A few months after using it, I still have no issues with any of the keys, trackpad, or connectivity. I highly recommend getting this renewed as it saves a lot of money compared to buying it new from Apple.",

I got excited when I found these \u201crenewed\u201d ones for half the price. I don\u2019t think the one I received was ever used. It was listed as \u201cexcellent\u201d condition but I was still expecting to see some minor signs of use. I\u2019d recommend getting one of these to anyone who is looking for one at a good price. I did take away a star because as great of a keyboard as it is I\u2019m not a fan with how much the iPad hangs over the keyboard. I end up bumping it a lot with my fingers. I\u2019m hoping this will stop as I get used to the form factor.",

Seeing this I was worried but when I took the keyboard out it was pristine. Hooked it up and away I went. There are reasons Apple products are the best to go with things like the iPad. They\u2019re simply the best. Buy renewed. This keyboard, in white, was $184 cheaper than Apple sells it for new.No real knocks on it. It is a little heavy which may bug some people, and if you angle it all the way back, you\u2019re almost typing underneath the iPad when using the number row. The iPad is held on by a magnet, which is extremely strong so there is no worry about it falling off. The floating design is cool and the pass through charging is very handy as it does cause some battery drain, seeing how the iPad powers the keyboard. Trackpad is very responsive. The cursor was very fast but you can set it to slow it down which I did. I also set it to tap to click instead it actually pushing down on the trackpad. Lots of options to play with and you can program your own shortcuts.All in all its fabulous. Buy it renewed.",

The only indication of it every being used was the cologne smell on it, lol. Very happy with the purchase, saved $200! Great keyboard feel, and the trackpad is excellent, on par with a macbook pro. The thing can be a little top-heavy and I'm still figuring out the best way to unfold the thing, but overall very pleased. At $270 its great value.",

La retroiluminaci\u00f3n de las teclas es muy \u00fatil y funciona de forma muy natural dependiendo de las condiciones de luz en las que te encuentres. El trackpad parece peque\u00f1o a primera vista pero una vez que comienzas a utilizarlo te das cuenta de que es perfecto, funciona con todos los gestos del de una macbook y te acostumbras super r\u00e1pido a aprovecharlos.En resumen es un gran producto, si lo compras estoy segura de que te va a encantar sin importar el color que elijas.",
