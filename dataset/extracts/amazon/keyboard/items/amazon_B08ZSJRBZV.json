                "reviewText": "UPDATE FROM ORIGINAL:After I wrote the review from below, the seller sent me a message and wanted to give me a full refund. I mentioned that I really love the keyboard and I just want one that works so they sent me a replacement. I brought it to work and works great. I am very happy with the seller for wanting to solve the issue and resending a replacement. I offered to send the one that broke back so they could see what happened to it and they said no need. I love this keyboard and mouse. I ordered a new one after this one broke and I did like my new one (from a different vendor) but the mouse was tiny and very sensitive. I really enjoy this one and am glad they sent a replacement for me. Highly recommend this keyboard and customer service is on point!Old review:So this worked fine and then I come into work one day and it wouldn\u2019t do anything. I put new batteries in and the light flickered but then it turned off, the keyboard won\u2019t turn on at all and I\u2019m confused. It was great for the month and now it\u2019s not working. I didn\u2019t do anything different so I just think it\u2019s odd. If it was the battery life, I think it should\u2019ve lasted longer than a month but even if the batteries died, why did everything stop working? Is there a way to refresh the keyboard or something??? I turned it off and back on a few times but only a faint light on the mouse went on and then it powered off and won\u2019t work. How do I go about fixing this?",

                "reviewText": "I had one of those bubble, high set key keyboards that LOOKS great but I couldn't type on it to save my life because of the space between the high, round keys, my fingers were constantly tripped up. I honestly don't know how people type on them because I was horrible at it. I needed flatter keys but I need a decent \"click\" or at least one I could feel. I don't like silent keyboards.This keyboard if the perfect combo. It's super comfortable, it has enough of a click (it's a muted click, if that means anything) and it actually fits on my very shallow pull out keyboard tray. The mouse that comes with it is also a perfectly fine, basic mouse that I really appreciate for it's simplicity.Less is more.My ONLY very tiny gripe is the sleep mode. I wish it just stayed awake. I'm used to it now but I hated having to double click to wake it up at first. That's not enough of one to take more than 1 star away to me but to get 5, you have to be perfect. This one isn't, but it's very close!",

                "reviewText": "Very cute and comfortable. Lightweight, affordable, all of the things you want in a keyboard! EXCEPT it lags so bad. It was fine for a week at work with no issues. The next week, it lagged for a few minutes at a time. Now (3 weeks later) the keyboard doesn't work properly. I'll type a letter in and once it decides to type, it'll have it put in 4 times. The copy and paste function isn't working. The lag is atrocious. I had to switched to a wired keyboard just to do my job well.Unsure if I want to risk trying a replacement or just getting a refund.UPDATE** I got the replacement and started using it today. It is also lagging. If you work in a call center or a job that requires a lot of typing, definitely do not recommend. It would probably be good for leisure.",
