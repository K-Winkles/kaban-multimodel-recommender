                "reviewText": "Using this off-brand keyboard for a few days fixed the official name-brand keyboard. I know this is a ridiculous claim, but here's what happened:At work we have an iMac for secondary purposes (such as making sure stuff also works on iOS and watching Netflix). It doesn't get used much, but it is beyond its warranty. The $50+ official Macintosh keyboard that came with it one day suddenly stopped responding to presses of the spacebar. (Everything else still worked.) I removed, cleaned, and reattached the spacebar a few times, and also rebooted the machine several times, but the spacebar would not start working again. (Apparently spacebar failure is very common in official Macintosh keyboards.)For the sake of typing the space character, I hooked up a for-Windows PC USB keyboard that I bought at the second-hand thrift store for a whole dollar. I also reattached the original Mac keyboard for the usefulness of its extra buttons such as the volume controls. This was an acceptable arrangement for a while, but then the Mac spacebar started to get and remain \"stuck,\" even after I fully removed the physical key. (The experienced effect was that web pages would scroll all the way down, because that's what typically happens when you hammer the spacebar when no input field has focus. Netflix playback also experienced seizures because the spacebar pauses and resumes videos.)I detached the fancy-pants aluminum keyboard because of its latest malfunction, leaving us with just the plain ol' PC keyboard. Again, this was a mostly acceptable solution, but we eventually decided we should get an operating-system-appropriate keyboard since the Windows key doesn't behave like the Quatrefoil key and the PC F[unction] keys don't do any of the extra stuff that the Mac F[unction] keys do, so we ordered this one for $20.After a few days of use, I was about to put away the old Mac keyboard when I thought of trying one more test: I went to keyboardtester-dot-com, plugged in the old keyboard and started mashing keys. To my surprise, the spacebar was working properly again!We put this new keyboard back in its box and we're holding on to it as an emergency backup, but unless the official Mac keyboard craps out again, we'll probably never ever use it again (for lack of need).By the way, this \"Macally 103 Key Full-Size USB Keyboard with Short-Cut Keys for Mac\" isn't really full-size; it's about an inch narrower than an actual \"full-size\" keyboard, which is achieved by smooshing the arrow keys and the six above between the main keys and the num pad, so its actually a \"compact keyboard (with num pad).\"The keys are comfortable to press, but one person said she kept getting confused by the compact arrangement of the arrows and the six above. I should knock a star off for this, but this product earns an extra 10 stars for A) having a functioning spacebar, B) fixing the other keyboard, and C) not being *incredibly* overpriced like everything else for Mac is.",

                "reviewText": "There are so few true bargains on Amazon - this, though, is one of them.We've got an older Macbook that has been working well, but was recently replaced and this one handed down to the kids. Needless to say, there was an 'accident' with a can of soda on the keyboard, and half the keys were destroyed. There is no way the value of the computer would've been worth replacing the keyboard (which had always been problematic in this particular mac), so I figured adios.Well, at least one last try before adios, which was the purchase of this keyboard. It's cheap, so how could we go wrong? The keyboard is full sized (as in very full sized) and hangs over the edge of the Macbook, which is a 15 incher. Plugged it into the USB port, had a pop-up menu that recognized the keyboard, and viola...instant new keyboard for old mac computer!We don't need a mouse since the touch pad still works fine. I'm typing on it right now, in fact, and the keys are light. They don't feel cheap at all; in fact, it's a lot more pleasant to type on this vs. the laptop's original keyboard (that particular keyboard for the model of Macbook has been a huge pain and was replaced once before.)There are very few things you can buy for $15 that solve a problem as well as this keyboard. The kayboard is nice, but sure, it's not lovely to look at, hanging over the edge of the laptop. But so what? It works great! And the kids like sitting back with the keyboard in their laps (it's got a nice length to it) and doing video games.This was an inexpensive solution that will enable us to get at least another year out of an old laptop. I couldn't be more pleased!",

                "reviewText": "It was difficult for me to decide what to rate this product. It worked well for about 2 weeks and then the n,m, *comma, *period, and ? keys stopped working. Ever tried typing without n and m? It's impossible to say what needs to be said. I couldn't even google 'macally keyboard Not working' to look for a fix. I want to give it a higher rating because the rest of it really wasn't bad, decent keys and I liked the full size and quality was decent other than the fact that those keys broke. But, when it comes down to it a keyboard that has failing letters after about 2 weeks is just not worth having, one that can't type m or n is essentially worthless for anything but 10 key. So, thus it gets 1 star, I'm back to that piece of garbage mac mini keyboard until I get a replacement, I should have gone with the apple full sized keyboard even though its twice the price.UPDATE:I was RMA'd a new keyboard and I guess the new ones work. I haven't had any issues, not sure why the last one stopped working but I have no complaints with the new one.",

                "reviewText": "I Bought this because I didn't want to pay Apple's ridiculous price for the wired version of this keyboard... After a few weeks, I'm gonna buy a used Apple Keyboard. This keyboard is CHEAP and it shows.The letters on this keyboard are stickers which means they fall right off and stick to your fingers. So far I've lost the letters for \"E, A, S, F, V, O\", \"Caps Lock\" and \"Shift\", and half of \"C and R\". I use those keys as shortcuts for editing in Adobe Premiere Pro and they very quickly fell off of their keys so I've resorted to drawing in the letters with a sharpie.Also, there seems to be a pretty big lag time between when I hit a key and when it registers on the computer, ESPECIALLY while using Premiere Pro. At first I thought it was a program issue or RAM issue but if I switch back to my normal keyboard while editing, there's no lag time so it is obviously this keyboard.",
