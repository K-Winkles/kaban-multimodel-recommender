                "reviewText": "This is the best mechanical keyboard at this price point. I purchased the one with red switches, and it types very smoothly. I prefer this switch for both gaming and coding. The fact that you can also swap the switches if necessary is amazing. I kind of wish there was some sort of knob or slider for the volume and maybe some stand at the back to give it a tilt, but at the same time, these are just minor issues. It is more ergonomic to type it flat anyways. The lighting could use a bit more variety (different patterns). I would've preferred an option to keep it solid. There is only a breathing pattern where one color flashes or the rainbow effect where the keys cycle different colors to the right. I will definitely not hesitate to buy this same keyboard again if the one I currently have needs a replacement somewhere down the line. I used a Razer mechanical keyboard with blue switches and other more expensive mechanical keyboard brands from China before this one, which cost quadruple the price of this one... I ended up liking the feel of this one most, so that definitely speaks volumes.",

                "reviewText": "Very solid mechanical keyboard. I'd say it competes with the likes of Corsair and Razer. I'm unsure how the product will hold up in the long term compared to a big brand name but it works well, has alot of very cool lighting effects. It's very worth the price even only having had it for a couple weeks now, I would recommend. It also comes with a keycap/switch puller, and a few extra switches (2 brown, 2 red, 2 blue) just so you can test them out, and maybe replace the switches if one ever decided to give out, or if you want a different feel out of specific keys. For example, I put blue switches on my spacebar, and shift keys, just to help discern which keys I'm on while gaming. Solid 5 stars.",
