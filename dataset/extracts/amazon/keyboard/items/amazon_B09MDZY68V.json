There\u2019s not much to dislike about this keyboard the only thing I dislike is the Clacky and loud the space bar is but I pretty much am INLOVE with this keyboard it\u2019s so pretty and I love how many animations there are and the sounds are amazing definitely a 5 star keyboard with a W price. I love this keyboard it\u2019s very clicky and creamy not to creamy) If your looking for a cheap and small gaming keyboard this is a good keyboard to use, I will say I didn\u2019t realize it didn\u2019t have a window key so if you have a windows computer and you use the windows button a lot just know that this doesn\u2019t have a windows key. I hope the video I made helped you out and help you figure out if you want this keyboard or not.",

                "reviewText": "For a budget keyboard, I think this keyboard is absolutely amazing. I'm using it to type this at the moment and the click sounds are just so fun to have. The light modes are also cool to explore. You click fn + (some random sun sigh, basically in between backspace and enter). I think the red switches are what you should get as they haven't gotten any bad reviews at the moment. Overall, looks a 9/10 only because the letters look low quality when in the rgb's. Other than that, 10/10 for value and gaming. Testing it out as it arrived immediately was amazing. Highly recommend!.",

I mainly program on the computer I got this for. I'm not young and have had buckling spring, membrane, scissor and the occasional mechanical. This is definitely a mechanical and these are definitely blue switches. If you're not familiar with them they're the loud clicky ones really good for typing. If you're a kid or gaming, get reds, not these. Otherwise they will seem really loud. Build quality is excellent and sturdy. Was relieved it doesn't have red keycaps on as I dont like the look. I was extremely partial to the old IBM keyboards, but the re-releases go for 150$. This is ballpark and having to pay 25$ on sale was pretty nice. Its 14\" across with no numpad which is a pretty good space saver and the key backlighting is there without being overpowering.",
