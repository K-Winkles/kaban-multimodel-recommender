                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great little keyboard",
                "reviewText": "I needed a little keyboard to go with my personal laptop since I don't like to type on my laptop while on its stand. It had to be small enough to fit under the laptop stand on my desk - 13 inches or less. That means I needed one without the number pad on the side which was fine.This little keyboard has full size, standard keys and comes in around 11 inches long It's a plug and play so all I had to do is insert the receiver into the USB on my computer and turn on the keyboard. It even came fully charged which is an added bonus! It's got everything you need in a small area including Cap Lock, FN and Power lights. Here's my take on this little gem:What I like - not in any particular order:Description matches the productSmall and compactLightweightFull size keysReal feel on the keypad while typing.Everything is clearly marked on the keys - high contrast white on black.Lights for Cap Lock, Function Lock and Power On in the upper right-hand corner of the unit.On/Off button on the back side.Power level light flashes when turned on to let you know how much juice you have left.USB power connection on the back side.Storage area for the USB receiver on the underside.Comes with USB cable for recharging.Rubber feet on the bottom corners to keep it from sliding around while typing.What I'm not too keen on:Keyboard is compact, i.e. not very ergonomic (but that's to be expected with a small unit).Related to the above, it's very easy to hit the Win key which is placed on either side of the space bar around ring-finger level.It has arrow keys but no Pg Up/Pg Dn buttons (something had to give being so compact)The Power On/Off button is very small but, once you know where it is, it's an easy flick of the finger.There are no adjustable feet to raise the keyboard. It has nominal elevation.All in all, this is a nice little keyboard. It would easily fit in luggage or briefcase if you needed to travel with it. I haven't had this long enough to evaluate battery life so I'll save that for later.Would I recommend this product? - Yes! in a heartbeat. Did I get it as a promotion? - No! I did my research and paid for it. Would I use this keyboard all day, every day for work? - Probably not! It's not ergonomic so extended typing may take a toll on your wrists. Hope this helps.",

                "reviewText": "This is not a paid review, honest!It's been a couple of months, and I've been very impressed with this overall excellent product.Its build quality is superb. It feel very solid and stout. It is comfortable. The keys have a great feel and great travel -- with, I guess, just the right amount of \"clickyness\".The built-in and rechargeable battery is an awesome convenience; and I have yet to need to pull out its charging wire (after these couple of months)!All-in-all, it is just a very solidly built and high quality product that I personally highly recommended to you -- for its price-point and it's excellent manufacturing and materials.The ONLY downside (or downer) that I would attribute to it, is its weight. I have had other wireless and compact computer keyboards before, and they were not nearly as heavy as this one! But personally, and for what I've had to use it for (primarily my home office use), I have not felt that its weight was a huge sticking point.So just keep its fairly hefty weight in mind if you are planning to travel a lot with this wireless keyboard.But once again, all-in-all, it comes highly recommended from a very satisfied customer of it!",

The fact that it has rechargeable batteries is a bonus.Received this keyboard which was already charged, plugged in the USB receiver which just took the laptop about 15 seconds to recognise and configure. Switched on the keyboard and it worked straight away.Key response seems to be as good as the laptop's keyboard (but without the duff keys ;-)).Nice feel, construction good and the size although slightly compact doesn't alter the natural use.Would I recommend it?
