Da ich bisher eine mechanische Tastatur hatte und recht viel und schnell tippe, war der laute Tippsound doch recht st\u00f6rend. Nachdem ich in einigen Videorezensionen gesehen hatte, dass die Tastatur sehr leise ist, habe ich sie bestellt.Ich wurde sehr positiv \u00fcberrascht! Diese Tastatur ist so leise, dass es fast schon unangenehm ist. Man hat das Gef\u00fchl, dass man das Tippen nur h\u00f6rt wenn kein anderes Ger\u00e4usch im Raum ist und man sich einzig und allein auf das Tippen konzentriert.Ansonsten sieht sie sehr schlicht aus und f\u00fchlt sich nicht billig an. Verbinden hat super schnell und einwandfrei geklappt.Einziges Manko ist, dass man f\u00fcr die Mausgeschwindigkeit nur drei Stufen w\u00e4hlen kann und die h\u00f6chste Stufe ist mir nicht schnell genug. Konnte ich aber mit den Einstellungen am PC beschleunigen.",
