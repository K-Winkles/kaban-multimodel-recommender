                "reviewText": "This keyboard replaces my MK510 that suddenly had failed return and eight keys after five years of hard use. I like the touch of the new keyboard. It is not a click but it does have a sound when you depress the keys. I would call the keys a longer throw vs a flat keyboard if you like that. The mouse is a model M310. The wheel and grip points are rubberized and gives you good control. There is one dongle that services the wireless connection for both devices. Note though that if you have a mouse that you prefer, like in my case an M510 mouse with some extra functionality you can still use your preferred mouse with its own dongle. Also if you wanted you can run one or the other mouse at the same time. I know trivial but I thought you mind find a use for that. One last detail. I saw evidence that the price on this set will soon be dropping to $39.99. I paid $49.99. Perhaps a newer model will be coming out. But I use my desktop every day and a lot. So I am not waiting for a price drop. I recommend this Keyboard and mouse combination.",

Love that it's a full keyboard, with F keys, number pad, and all the directional keys where they belong. Worked plug and play out of the box.The mouse is so-so. It's smaller than many others. Wish Logitech bundled the larger M720 mouse with this kit (perfect mouse, in my mind). Fortunately, my old M720 works fine with its old USB receiver at the same time the new keyboard works with its new one that came in this kit. Best of both worlds!",

                "reviewText": "(edit at end of review on how to remedy a web browser scrolling behavior issue)I have purchased many Logitech products over the years, including mice and keyboards. This keyboard is the same good quality you can expect from Logitech.The keyboard is comfortable to type on, with a soft key click (hardly a click at all) and nice spring action to the keys. I like the function key shortcuts built into this keyboard such as Save, Print, Control Panel and others, I don't think I've had those on a keyboard before. Dedicated buttons for Calculator and screen lock are nice too. The wrist rest adds a bit of depth to the overall unit but not annoyingly-so. The keyboard has three height/angle options... two with different stand pieces, and another with both stand pieces folded in. Logitech says the battery will last 36 months, that's great if it makes it that long.The optional software download will let you change some key assignments.The mouse is simple and comfortable. It features the typical left/right buttons, scroll wheel, and scroll wheel click. It is no-frills but not cheap-feeling either.The only two cons I have found, that I'd maybe take half a star off if I could, were...- In order to default to the \"F-keys\" for F1 through F12, you need to do that in the settings of the optional software download. On other keyboards (Logitech-branded and others) this is usually done with Function-ESC- The dedicated \"home\" button on the keyboard launches a browser, but you can't customize what browser loads. I run different portable Chrome installations for work and personal, and I could not find a way to have the Home button default to the one I wanted. This doesn't bother me because I don't think I'd regularly use a shortcut key to launch a browser anyway, so I reassigned that key with the software to show the desktopOverall a very nice keyboard and mouse set that is comfortable and should last a long time.edit: I wanted to pass on a setting that addressed an issue that emerged... while scrolling web pages in Chrome with the scroll wheel, the scrolling would not stop on a dime when the mouse scrolling stopped, it would kind of slow down and stop. This made immediately clicking on a web page element difficult because the target would still be moving. Also it seemed that pages like Google Maps didn't know what to do with that, with a zoomed-in house zooming out to the entire region with one wheel scroll move sometimes. To turn off this behavior, launch the Logitec Options+ app (if you installed it), click on the mouse, click on \"Point and Scroll\", click on the scroll wheel, and turn off the \"Smooth Scrolling\" option. This change returned scroll behavior to what I had expected, stops on a dime now.",

                "reviewText": "Having been a computer guy for over 40 years, I have laid hands on literally thousands of keyboards, but I always find myself migrating back to major brands like Logitech. They consistently make decent quality consumer products across the spectrum. They may not be able to touch the more niche markets, but the quality of their products is better than the vast majority of junk being pushed into the American market. As such, I am proud to claim I have several Logitech keyboards and mice, including RF, Bluetooth, Wired and Gaming products. I'm actually typing this review on the great Logitech G910 Orion Spectrum RGB Wired Mechanical Gaming Keyboard right now.This particular keyboard + mouse combo is clearly intended for use with a laptop. It is a 2.4 MHz RF wireless unit (i.e. NOT Bluetooth) with a shared dongle for both keyboard and mouse. Either or both devices can be used independently or at the same time with no issues. I didn't see any noticeable lag when using either the keyboard or mouse during my testing, but that is not usually a big concern for a non-gaming purposes.The keyboard is a Logitech K540, which uses a standard Extended-AT keyboard layout with extra media and application keys. I really like the fact that the application keys seem to work perfectly even without a driver. I tested this on a fully locked down (HP EliteBook) laptop with no administrator rights and had no issues whatsoever. The various FN-shifted application keys did everything they were supposed to do right out of the gate. The keyboard is not heavy and the the low key profile is typical of laptop-style keyboard. The keys move smoothly through the very short throw distance. The keyboard is quiet, but there is enough feedback from each key to let you know you have actually fully depressed each key as you type.The mouse is a Logitech M310, a standard mid-sized ambidextrous \"3-button\" design (two-buttons with a clickable wheel) with a pretty good hand feel with either hand. Like the keyboard, it's very light. Tracking seems pretty good and, because I actually own two other M310 mice, I know it has decent quality microswitches that will easily last a few years under daily use.As with most Logitech wireless products, batteries are included. They are really generic batteries, but hey, they ARE included.",
