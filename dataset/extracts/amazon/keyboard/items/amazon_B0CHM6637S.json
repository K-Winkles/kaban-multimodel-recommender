                "reviewText": "For what you pay, you get a lot of features. I have not had any issues on a wireless connection, and the battery capacity isn't terrible. The screen may seem gimmicky, but it does has useful features, such as letting you know when the caps lock and num lock are on/off. It is a little hard to navigate the menus for the screen at first, but after a slight learning curve it's easy to use.The keycaps are very high quality for being stock, and the profile is great. They hug your fingers, but the curvature is not too aggressive. I ordered the model with the tactile switches, and they offer a good amount of resistance. They feel better than the Kailh browns I had on my previous keyboard, and the sound is very pleasing. It's a deeper clack, as opposed to a high pitched clicky sound. I can't make out any pinging/ringing. The stabilizers are pre-lubed and the hot swap process is easy, if you ever want to change the switches out.if I had to nitpick anything, it's that the software used to customize the keyboard is a little hard to use. I would prefer some sort of VIA implementation. I also wish that it would interface with OpenRGB so I can coordinate the colors with my mouse and the ARGB fans on my PC. These are minor issues, though. Overall, I would definitely recommend anyone interested in a preassembled mechanical keyboard to try it out.",
