                "reviewText": "I am deathly afraid of spiders. Full on, irrationally terrified to the point where my very soul would pee its pants if it could if a spider is too close to me. It's stupid, I know, but I tell you this so you can understand.I ordered this keyboard in September of 2021, it is now the end of June 2022. It's been a perfectly fine and adorable keyboard. The other day, I was chilling in a recliner with my keyboard on my lap, doing some light gaming (dailies, amirite), and in the midst of a brutal arachnid attack, I accidentally yeeted this keyboard across my living room. Hard. Like landed with a sickening \"that's definitely broken\" thud. Almost killed my tv with it too, but I digress.It still works perfectly. 2 keys popped off in the flurry, but neither they nor their switches sustained any damage. If your hesitation to buy this keyboard is a durability concern, where you're thinking \"maybe I should just spend a bit more and get something more heavy duty,\" you need not fear.I was a hardcore Razer customer for years. Switched to this from Razer Hunstman, which was a replacement for my Razer Chroma BlackWidow V2, and so on. This keyboard still has a nice, sturdy metal body without the excess weight and, if I can be frank, also without the unnecessary angular shape and even sharp edges present in the Huntsman and similar keyboards. And it's pink. And lights up. And has a 10key. And survives spider-induced violent yeetings. Just buy the darn thing!",

Feet click into place so they don't move when you slide the keyboard around. Good gaming key clicks. Comes with a keycap puller. Price and fast shipping.The things I don't like about it:Bad typing clicks, it's too loud when you're typing for a long period of time. The font on the keys is not visually appealing. Sounds a little hollow and matalic on the space bar. No control over RGB settings. VERY long cable.All and all, I love it. It's great for the price and I don't mind it's issues, which are personal and might not be problems for anyone else. It works for what I need it to and would recommend it to someone that isn't looking for anything professional. I'm impressed with how heavy and solid it feels.",

                "reviewText": "I used to use a Microsoft Sidewinder, since I was typing in Japanese for some things, and having the characters on the board was really nice. When it started to die, I took a look at regular mechanical keyboards, since I didn't need the Japanese keys, anymore, and my gf really liked her mech board. I always hated the loudness of the switches, however. This keyboard, however, isn't any louder than my Sidewinder, and the feel of the keys is great. I use it for gaming, typing, and for photo editing work. I finally get the appeal.The backlighting has far more options than I would ever need, being the kind of person who just keeps it on the solid white setting. But, changing lighting setups is beyond easy, and the manual is very helpful.As I said, the keys/switches feel awesome, and the noise is minimal. They have the right amount of spring and click, without being obnoxious.I don't know what else I can say other than that this keyboard made a longtime skeptic a believer. Great price, and great quality.",

                "reviewText": "I am very fussy over keyboards, and have tried many. Ironically, the best ones have been those originally supplied with old computers, all of which had mechanical switches.I'm not a gamer, so this is strictly about typing, but this keyboard is shockingly good. Ok, the lighting is a bit odd, and the colours can't be changed, even though the lighting patterns can, but for feel in use working on typing lengthy documents, this feels absolutely great.It has linear keys which operate very smoothly without the 'action point' in something like blue switches, but it is just resistive enough, and in use is hard to fault. It's also not a 'click' as a blue switch, but still does make distinctive sounds.Control of the lighting is pretty easy, and there's a slip of instructions included that explain the use of the FN key to increase/decrease speed of lighting effects and brightness, change modes, and turn backlighting on and off.There are probably better keyboards out there, but at $29.90, I don't think this would be beatable for value. I bought one for me, then a number of them for work.EDIT to add that of 6 keyboards ordered, 2 arrived with up to 4 F-keys broken off each. The boxes were all undamaged, so this must be happening during packing at the factory. All but one of the keys either pressed back on, or could be repaired with superglue, but one required a new key-switch, because the stem was also damaged.",
