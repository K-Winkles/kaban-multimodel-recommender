                "reviewText": "I bought this keyboard for work and school. I like it so far, however, I find that it is pretty loud when I type with it. The noise is kind of annoying especially since I do a lot of programming and typing. Aside from that, it's an ok keyboard.I like that I can customize the lights and speed. I can turn off the lighting if I want, but personally, I like the colors changing. The keys feel cheap, but that's because it is haha. You get what you pay for. The letter N has rubbed off after a couple of weeks of use, so I'm disappointed.I had an expensive keyboard that started giving me issues, so I replaced it with this one because it's much cheaper to replace if it breaks. I was looking for something functional and cheap, and this one does the job. The only thing is I wish it wasn't so loud to type on and the letters rub off. It's still a great deal for a light up keyboard.After using the keyboard for several days, it started making a lot of noise from the space bar. It was horrible! I put some WD-40 on a q-tip and rubbed it on the spring under the spacebar and that seemed to help.The space bar sound from the spring makes me think of a cymbal if it was super tiny. Since I use the spacebar like all the time, I hear it constantly and it's really annoying.I work on the computer all day, every day so my keyboards get used constantly. I suddenly started having problems with it. I couldn't get the space bar to work - I immediately assumed it was the keyboard at fault, but after testing out another keyboard I had the same problem. It turns out its a software issue that has to do with Windows.If the keys stop working, first check to see if it is a software issue causing the problem. Turn off \"sticky keys\" and \"filter keys\", then try it. That fixed it for me.So.. overall, this keyboard works, but it's kinda loud and the letters rub off after a few weeks of daily use.",

I looked at far more expensive back lit keyboards and took a chance in this because of the price. It works great, I can see the keys great at night and it didn\u2019t cost an arm and a leg. I will say it is very loud on key strokes so if that bothers you keep that in mind. 10 out of 10 for a cheap light up keyboard",

After about a month of using it, the finish on the keys started showing some signs of wear. After about 3 months, some of the keys were not legible at all. Soon, after that, all of the finish on most of the keys was gone. Luckily I am an avid typist and do not need to look at the keyboard to type. If you are a hunt and peck typist and you need to see the letters on the keys...this is NOT the keyboard for you. It is really disappointing too since I love the \"clicky\" quality of this keyboard. I wish I could find one just like it that did not look like complete crap from me using it. Overall....this is pretty cheap quality stuff.",
