                "reviewText": "I've been using wireless keyboards and mice for about 15 years now. The only one that still works after all this time is Logitec. A couple of years ago I bought one mouse/keyboard combo from \"Jelly\" and while the mouse was great, the keyboard was far from good. Very quickly it developed poor contact and had to be tapped in a certain spot to work again.Then I ordered this combo, hoping it would work for my basic needs. I mean, how hard can it be to send a 2.4Ghz signal over a few feet distance? Apparently, it's very hard.Both the keyboard and mouse use only one battery. The mouse uses 1 AA battery while the keyboard uses 1 AAA battery. I thought that perhaps things were getting more efficient in the wireless world, but I was wrong. They are only getting cheaper and more useless. As I type this, I have to constantly go back to correct \"errors\" caused by skipped characters. Add to that the fact that the keyboard is not user friendly, with some keys requiring more pressure than others, and the whole experience is a torture. As I typed this previous sentence, entire words got doubled so I'd get \"entirretier\"... and so on.All in all by far the worst experience of any wirerels keyboard soaalavit he errr for you to see how terrible iti(the above is meant to say \"leaving the errors for you to see how terrible it is\" and the previous line is supposed to say \"of any wireless keyboard so far\")p.s. I am about 7 feet away from the computer and little USB receiver, with no other remote devices aroundp.p.s. Old logitec keyboard has no problems at all. It is almost 15 years old and still working. Havy, loud with all letters erased but unlike this garbage, it works.",

                "reviewText": "In my opinion, it's not worth getting out of paying the extra couple of dollars for a decent Logitech. Flat keys are difficult to use and I just discovered that the key is switched with the apostrophes key somehow I don't know how that happened. Honestly it's just so annoying the little things about it that are a nuisance. It is too late unfortunately for me to return it or I certainly would. Right now I think there's a good chance I will just break down and buy another Logitech good one with Ray's keys that are easy to use",
