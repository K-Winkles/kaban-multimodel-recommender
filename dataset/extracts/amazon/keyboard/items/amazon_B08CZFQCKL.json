I am still pounding away at this keyboard everyday and it never ceases to impress me.First of all I'm a hard typer. I don't know why that is, it just is!! I am pretty hard on keyboards. I tell you when i first got it out of the box it was impressive and 6 months later it still continues to impress me. I don't know if i told you in the first part of the review or not that i'm on the never ending quest to find the perfect keyboard. Well I think for under $50.00 dollars That quest is coming to an end!! I swear I have paid 300 dollars for keyboards and have been less excited than i am with this keyboard. Wireless, gaming, totally programable, all the way down to elegant pretty keyboards that cost an arm and a leg and are so fragile you're afraid to type on them. This key board is a one and done kind of thing really. My only Half wish or gripe if had to wrestle one down would be I wish it were wireless as well. But who knows they might have a wireless version by now and I just missed it!! no matter what, that is not a deal breaker at all. this keyboard is to great to get hung up on something cheezy like that. it still types smooth, the keys bounce or have a great spring to them, its slim, dark aluminum grey with looks great with my mac. Oh yea, and did i mention it works well with my mac!! no hang ups not crappy buttons not working that are supposed to work, no weird acting junk that goes along with a \"KEYBOARD THAT IS MAC FRIENDLY\" no this is the real deal it works every button on it works for a mac and a pc, which is truly impressive. i have a duel computer desk with each computer having its own keyboard and one is a windows and my main computer is a mac and it works flawlessly for both of them.I cant say enough great things about this keyboard!! I think i'm going to buy a couple as back ups because if getting older has taught me anything, its that something this good will not be around forever!! companies sold, the market, bad luck whatever you want to say. when i run across something like this in my life, the cruel gods of fate just seam to take it away from me!! (sorry i can get a little dramatic lol) so go out and get one today. you wont be sorry. read my previous review so you can get a feel for this keyboard and one more thing!! if you think this add on review was hi energy, Just wait 6 months because if will let you know after a year of banging away at this keyboard how things are again. many many many many keyboards have not lasted even this long and I paid a whole lot more for them than i ever thought of paying for this keyboard. so come back and check out how it is living up to my expectations after a year. i have a feeling it will do just fine, Bless you all and shop safeI have been on the hunt for not only a easy to use and type on keyboard ,but one that looks nice and that doesn't break the bank and more than anything works with a mac!! i think i've found such a keyboard. first off it looks great, it's very slim in design the individual keys each light up instead of keys sharing lights underneath. It looks great with my mac but more importantly if works great with my mac!! you just plug it in and bam it works no fuss no headache!!! all of the key functions work without incidents and it even has the mac symbols on the key that do both mac and windows. speaking of that it has a key that lets you toggle between a mac setup and a windows setup. the keys are light and spring nicely while typing its full size and laid out nicely. I really like typing on the keyboard.The only really down side is that you don't have much control over the lighting. It lites up multiple different colors and those colors work well. but you can't assign certain keys their own lights or really customise it. having said that you can customise they keys and the layout through your computer but your limited to what you can do with your computer software!! but that's really the only downside to the keyboard!!other than that it's a fantastic keyboard and i'm very happy with it!!! if you are on the fence about getting a keyboard that works well with macs, that is backlit and looks and functions great go for this keyboard because I've went through quite a few and let me tell you they are mostly disappointing or they are $250.00 dollars. this is an amazing keyboard and the price is just as amazing. you will love it",

                "reviewText": "As a writer, I like this keyboard because it's slim with flat keys, making it faster for typing and also quieter than typical keyboards. Even though it's slim, it feels very heavy and robust (doesn't feel like a piece of junk). I like the lighted keys, too, which is also a requirement for nighttime writing. There are a lot of color options, and also a fade option that rotates between all the colors (my preference). There's also a very thin, flexible, and tranluscent rubber covering that you can leave on or take off. It will help keep moisture and crumbs from getting into the keys. I leave it on when I'm not in fast-writing mode to help keep it clean, and I take it off when writing fast because the covering makes typing just a fraction slower. I really like having it, though, because I really want to keep this keyboard clean. Anyway, so far so good, and first impression is that I highly recommend this keyboar for any fast typers out there. This keyboard is defintely better than some of the others out there.",

                "reviewText": "Years ago we used this type of keyboard at work and after a short adjustment period everyone's typing speed increased. Everything we did had a deadline so we were always under pressure to type faster. And the low profile keyboard with the soft keys really helped us to get caught up. I got so fast that people would stop and watch. They couldn't believe it! But really once your fingers get used to it and if you typed for eight hours a day anyone could get that fast. But I wanted a backlit gaming keyboard and wasn't sure if this one would be good enough for a casual gamer. But the cost was the final determining factor and I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER WITH IT. It's nice to feel satisfied again. There are no \"Cons\", but here are the pros after a week or so: The white back lighting is perfect for gaming when every second counts. The other colors are cool too. I especially like this weird yellowish, greenish gold. All of the colors are bright enough without being obnoxious. They are just right and there is a good variety. The keys have a slight curve that perfectly slides your fingers right to the center of the keys. Typing has a comfortable spongy feel to it whether you type on the tips of your fingers or the pad of your fingers. the keys have a silky feel. Comes with a cover. I just use it when I'm not on the computer in case a cat comes along. Some people use it while typing, but I don't recommend that. It's inexpensive, but looks expensive. I'm going to order another one for our other computer and probably a third to keep just incase something happens to one of them. I really couldn't be happier with the purchase. It just looks cleaner and more expensive that the other kind. It was easy to hook up, just plug in the usb.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this because I needed a thin keyboard to fit under my desk. I spent a little more for the backlighting, and took a chance on a company that I have never heard of. There is a little deck flex, but the aluminum is sturdy, having enough weight that it doesn't feel cheap. The backlighting is good enough to clearly see the letters and commands, but not anything special beyond that. I'm not sure if the key caps are going to be the kind that wear off overtime, but time will tell. Typing feels good. For the keys being so short, it is surprisingly easy to type on after you spend a few hours with it. The scissor keys are pretty quiet, thought not silent, and have a really nice, tactile bump that makes the experience a treat. If you were wondering; though it has RGB (kinda) it is not a gaming keyboard. I found that if you press switches consecutively to fast, the keyboard will start eating your inputs. For typing, it's great. I however will not be trading in my keychron with the gator reds. I'll give this a 5th star in a year if it survives that long.",

It has a backlight, super quiet, works really fast and even has RGB light options. I don't game so I am unsure how well it works for that, but I use it for work which requires a lot of typing and it works great. Only downside is that it ships outside of Canada which results in extra fees but totally worth it for the price!",

                "reviewText": "In person it doesn't look that impressive, but with a fully metal deck and what turned out to be very comfortable keys, I'm actually really happy with the purchase.The build quality is a little precarious, I'm not sure if it will last many years, so I guess that's a warning. If you type by hunt-and-peck with some force because you once used a typewriter, you might damage it.But I'll say this: Shortly after this I got a Logitech MX Keys keyboard, which is almost an identical product, but it's the opposite of this: Great build quality, but rattly keys with a shiny uncomfortable finish, a plastic deck, and worse backlighting. It costs well over 3x of this keyboard, and it's sitting unused because I like this Powzan more. It does the important things right. It's not perfect but it's better than any competition I found when I was looking. I totally recommend it as a sensible option for a backlit Mac keyboard or even as a general Mac keyboard option if you want slightly less clicky keys with a little more travel.",
