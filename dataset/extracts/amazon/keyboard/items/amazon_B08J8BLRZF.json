Initially, I was taken aback upon discovering the keyboard operates on button-type batteries as I hadn't read the specifications carefully and had assumed it was rechargeable via USB cable. However, the manual estimates a battery life of about 3 years, which significantly eases my concerns about battery longevity.Compared to the large surface wireless keyboard, this keyboard is smaller and flat, which makes it easier to carry, the Bluetooth connection is pretty stable, and the keys are comfortable to press. I'd highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "Good quality, well built keyboard. For travel, this is absolutely a 5 star keyboard. However I was looking for a compact keyboard for daily use. In that regard, there are some drawbacks. The biggest is the lack of backlighting which is obviously quite useful for night time/dimly lit environments. The upside is that it's very thin and light and the batteries last forever (but aren't rechargeable). Great trade off for travel, not so much for daily. Also, while the keyboard feels nice and all, the key travel is short and prolonged typing feels fatiguing fairly quickly. Again a trade off of being thin and light. Another thing I don't like is that the up/down arrows are smaller than the left/right arrows. I understand this was done for size reasons, but I think making the left/right arrows the same size and leaving some space would be more intuitive and make the keys quick and easier to locate without looking. Also, the locating bumps on the fn keys are a nice touch but at least for me they're too subtle to be very useful. If these were more prominent- and one was included on the up arrow- it would be a really nice feature. Also I very much appreciate microsoft including home/end/pg up/pg down function keys. A business minded company as always, these are much more useful than emoji keys and other such silliness. IMO the search and media player keys could be traded for brightness up/down keys. Can probably be customized but I didn't get as far as trying.tl;dr- If you're travelling or have a mobile setup like a surface tablet, this is a fantastic keyboard. If you have a stationary setup, you'll be happier upgrading to something with longer key travel and backlighting.Stationary upgrade options? Either the logitech mx keys mini or compact, low-profile mechanicals. Eg. keychron k3, nuphy air75, or logitech mx mechanical mini.",

                "reviewText": "I've tested several keyboards over the last year to be used externally for my work laptop, and this one is working the best. It reminds me of my Apple Mac Keyboard, with the low stroke keys. This keyboard has a slight rubberized feel for the keys and board which I like. The size and spacing of the keys are nearly identical to my Apple Keyboard. So far, it's been working well with a bluetooth connection to my Dell laptop and also a bluetooth connection to my Mac Mini. Switching between the two machines is quick and easy with a simple button press. I've only used this keyboard for about a week, so I can't comment on the battery life. I'm definitely happy with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "A little bit about me... I spend many of my days working from home on an iMac (2020). Mac bluetooth keyboard is just my favorite - low profile, tactile, easy to type on. I spend some of my days at an office with my Lenovo Windows work laptop docked, and I've explored many options to get parity between the two workspaces. Honestly, the cheaper wireless Logitech keyboards my office paid for are good enough for most, but I'm a little too picky. The K380 is a decent facsimile, but the round keys are just a *little* too small for all day typing.I bought this one on sale and immediately fell in love. Not sure I love it quite as much as Apple's Magic Keyboard, but honestly? The key travel/\"sponginess\" might be a slight step up. The hotkeys at the top are very convenient. And the battery is going to be insane.Sure, the plastic construction feels a little cheap. Otherwise, it looks great on a desk, feels comfortable to type on for hours at a time, and makes my transition from home-Mac to work-PC very seamless. (I'd buy one for home if I were a full-time Windows user!)",

However...Materials:After a short time, within a month or two the finish began to rub off of the keys most used. Check the photo included.Pairing:Once paired it seemed to work fine for a while but then now and then it would need to be repaired. Now for some reason, it refuses to pair on channel 1, channel one appears locked. I unlocked the Fn key to ensure that was not the issue. It was time to get a new PC so, I built a new PC to rule out the PC of course. Same issue, not pairing. I had this paired to my Main PC, a Macbook Pro, and a Samsung S7+ tablet.Battery Life:I purchased the unit in late October and the low battery warning at 25% came on within 2 months and hit 0% at 8 months. I realize that math does not make sense. To note that brand new the battery showed 50% as did the replacement batteries that were put in about a month ago as I type, on my new Logitech K380.There does not seem to be a way to reset or clear the pairing channels. I took the batteries out and turned it off and on, it still would not pair. Microsoft support is not helpful.I would NOT recommend purchasing this keyboard since the box of 2032 3V lithium batteries I bought specifically for this keyboard outlasted the keyboard.",

I take a lot of notes in my work and I don't want the sound of me capturing notes to bleed into my video conference calls where I do a lot of talking.I have been eyeing this compact designer keyboard for a bit as I've always been a fan of Microsoft keyboards and this one also supports multiple devices. I thought this could be handy if I ever integrate an iPad into my day-to-day workflow at my desk.Pros:- Well made!- Satisfying typing experience for touch typers.- Compact, would also be good for those of you who are travelling for your work or school. Easy to throw in a bag.- Function keys are the default press, which is great. You have to hit Function + when you want to use the F-key. Smart.Cons:- The color / material definitely picks up the grease from your fingers... it looks greasy on the regular and I need to wipe it down.- I'll wait and see around the battery life and the availability of batteries. If I forget to keep CR2032s in stock and the battery dies... that could be annoying. I'll try my best to be proactive there.All-in-all, I really like this keyboard. Feels great. Recommended.",

The cons, I wish it was backlit as I often work late into the evenings and like to dim down the lights around me. But this definitely has not been a deal-breaker due to the other useful tools integrated into the keyboard. Pros, I love the feeling of the keys (easily to type, coming from a macbook air user of 5 years this was an incredibly easy shift), my typing speed has varied between 85-95 wpm consistently. There are also several 'tool' buttons that I love, such as the screen capture button, and you can connect the play/pause button to spotify open on your desktop. While I haven't often used the emoji button, I personally find this to be a really cute addition, and I would never have reached for the ctrl button that would have normally been in that place.Additionally, I have used this keyboard for casual gaming and it has worked great! It has always responded quickly, and consistently while in use.To respond to the issue of the keyboard taking a while to wake up - this 5 seconds is longer than any other wireless keyboard I have used in the past, but to be completely honest it doesn't bother me! While at the computer I just press the arrow or space key knowing it takes a second to load up, but once awake this keyboard has no delays what so ever. Overall love the keyboard, and hope to use it for years to come.",
