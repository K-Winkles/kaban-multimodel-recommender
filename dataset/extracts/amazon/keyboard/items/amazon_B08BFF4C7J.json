                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Razer Huntsman Mini and I must say I am very impressed. Firstly, the look and feel of the keyboard is amazing. It's sleek and compact design fits perfectly on my desk and the keys have a satisfying tactile feel when pressed.While I initially purchased this keyboard for gaming purposes, I now use it in the office as well. The Huntsman Mini is a great option for office work due to its compact size and it's easy to type on for extended periods of time.One of the things that really stood out to me about this keyboard is the software. The Razer Synapse software is incredibly easy to use and allows for customization of the keyboard's RGB lighting and other settings. It's much simpler than other keyboard software I have used in the past.Overall, I highly recommend the Razer Huntsman Mini to anyone looking for a high-quality and versatile keyboard. Its design and feel are top-notch, and the software is user-friendly and easy to navigate.",

The power cable being detachable is also a huge upside for ease of transport. The RGB brightness isn't bad either. And the actuation time and response rate is phenomenal which is the make or break point in this kind of keyboard and they nailed it perfectly. As I said in the title of my review this keyboard is for those that want a professional experience. If you are looking to be insane at a game or something to go pro in, then this is that keyboard.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not exaggerating, it literately stopped working in around 5 minutes. I had it plugged into my desktop and the lights turned off after just a few minutes. I thought maybe my computer went to sleep, nope. I tried unplugging and plugging it back in on both ends of the usb cable nothing and lights wouldn't come back on. Tried another usb C to A cable, didn't work. Took it and plugged it into my Razer Blade laptop and nothing. The keyboard feels and sounds great, but considering it didn't last for me beyond 10 minutes I can't call it good which sucks because the typing feels and sounds great! So for now, I've plugged back in my reliable $15 Walmart keyboard.Next day editAfter fiddling with it some more it would seem the usb c port on the keyboard is where the problem is. I can get Windows to detect the keyboard if I wiggle the plugged in cable provided but it rapidly connects and disconnects and the lights on the keyboard flash. It doesn't stay on long enough for Windows to set it up. So I'm not sure if this is a quality or shipping issue, but either way still disappointing. I also tried multiple other usb cables and they didn't help. I actually had better luck with the cable provided, but still not enough to get it to stay on.After Service RMAIncreasing rating after contacting Razer support and working with them to get a RMA replacement. The replaced keyboard works great and I love it! The keyboard is precise, quiet and quick! I would give this replaced keyboard 5 stars, but dropping just one star since the first one I got did fail almost instantly.",
