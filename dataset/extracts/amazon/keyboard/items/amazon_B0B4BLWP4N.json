If I\u2019m typing quickly, I find it\u2019s very easy for my fingers to slip and type a wrong key - sometimes while barely even bumping. It\u2019s great that the keys are so responsive, just had a bit of a learning curve, even for advanced typists. Battery life has been great so far, and it\u2019s very easy to switch paired device. Overall highly recommend.",

Does have a usb connection piece. Is not rechargeable but battery life is great (I always shut off after using). The keys are easy to remove. Comes with 4 other emoji button options. The colors are vibrant and really do pop! The sound of the mechanical keys is sharp and what any lover of mechanical keys are looking for!

                "reviewText": "I love this keyboard so much that I just ordered another one that I don't need in a different color, just because they are so cute and so good. They are super easy to pair and to switch between devices at the press of a button. The mechanical switches are wonderfully tactile and give good audio feedback. Some of the emoji buttons are swappable and they make inserting emojis really easy. Note, however, that you would need to install the Logitech software specific to this keyboard in order to take advantage of the emoji insertion feature, and from what I remember, it is not available for Mac or for Android. The keyboard still works with all platforms no problem otherwise.",

Lo hab\u00eda comprado pensando en llevarlo a la oficina pero al ser tan alto, duelen las mu\u00f1ecas para escribir y necesita un soporte para las manos para escribir bien en el lo cual me complica la movilidad del mismo diariamente. Por ese motivo lo devolv\u00ed. Si es para un puesto fijo lo recomiendo pero para movilizarlo diariamente no pues el soporte de manos suma peso y espacio para su trasporte.",

La envoltura en la que ven\u00eda el teclado era un pl\u00e1stico en lugar del papel con el logo de logitech que deber\u00eda, fuera de eso todo parece estar bien, el teclado no incluye la letra \u00f1. Las teclas se sienten muy bien son suaves, pero se siente claramente que es un teclado mec\u00e1nico. Adicional, requiere presionar la tecla de forma \"profunda\" como en una m\u00e1quina de escribir, por lo que personas de dedos grandes podr\u00edan tener problemas, aunque es f\u00e1cil acostumbrarse. Por \u00faltimo, ES UN TECLADO INALAMBRICO, pero duran bastante las bater\u00edas (no incluidas).",
