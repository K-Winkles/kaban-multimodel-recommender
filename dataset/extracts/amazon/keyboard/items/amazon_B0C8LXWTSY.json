(not a big issue for 90% of users) but if your a constant F11 or F2 boot person, holding FN2 and the \"2\" or \"-\" keys to hit the corresponding key at system boot, it DOES work just something you sometimes forget when not having dedicated Function keys. NOT KNOCKING any stars, (user error/issue)love the keyboard it actually replaced my more expensive Corsair keyboard as i like the size and sound.",

                "reviewText": "The keyboard feels slightly plasticky, and the keys bleed light, with the \"dual injection\" looking prettysloppy on a lot of keys.That being said, the keyboard is pretty nice all things considered, the price makes it easy to look past any shortcomings. The RGB's are nice, bonus points that you don't need to download or run any additional software, you can just control them from the keys themselves.The switch feel is decent, I wouldn't say it's anything to write home about but I would say it's definitely good enough. The sound could be better out of the box, it's also far from the worst. I put foam in the bottom of the casing, and without doing anything else the sound improved significantly on the same keys and switches. The switches are hot swappable too, which is awesome for a keyboard in this price range.I unfortunately won't be keeping this keyboard, because there's no \"feet\" on the back to adjust the angle, and I feel like it lays too flat for my personal preference, but all things considered you can do much worse than this keyboard.",

I left it on the default setting because i like it so much so i didnt try any other settings. this is my first 65% keyboard. also my first keyboard with red linear switchs, they feel amazing and consistant. The coiled cable is amazing and good quality. i dont mind the key colour at all. one final note. the space bar is loud and rattley but functions perfectly. i bought this key board to mod (lube, foam, tape, etc) and i think it a great starter keyboard if this is the size youre looking for. also i dont know if this is hot swapable or not as im not taking it apart yet. the white keys are snow white, the texture is what i like. at this price i might buy a few more and find some key caps for my other computers.came with board, cable, and key cap puller,RGB looks way better in person.UPDATE. The PCB is soldered. The switches are north facing.I won\u2019t be desoldering it to lube the switches but you can still tape the PCB and band-aid the stabilizers if you\u2019re super careful.",

I like the design and style of it. while the keyboard types click might be a load for some people I enjoy the sound of it.There are many different background colours to choose from, backlight options, and patterns that anyone can find an option they will enjoy.My only Frustration is as a Mac user there really isn't a Mac option when buying the Keyboard so switching commands between Mac and Windows was a learning curve and cost me more than I would have initially wanted.If you're doing a lot of work and need a high-end Keyboard then you probably won't want this one, but for anyone else, this is a great option and I would recommend it to most anyone.",
