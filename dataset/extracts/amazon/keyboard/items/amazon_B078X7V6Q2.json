                "reviewText": "While I'm not a gamer, I was looking for a sleek keyboard to use with my laptop/monitor setup that I use for schoolwork, casual gaming, and uploading YouTube videos. I couldn't be happier with the KLIM Chroma gaming keyboard! The keys are large enough and ideal for someone who makes a lot of typos (like me) and allow for fast typing with less errors! Even some of my friends who are gamers were impressed by its design and are considering this product! I purchased this product twice, first in the beginning of 2019 and unfortunately, the keyboard broke after falling off the desk and smashing into the leg of my chair, so I immediately ordered a second one that I've had for about a week now. I absolutely love it! And the price is great, actually less expensive than what I'd expect for such a quality keyboard! As I mentioned at the beginning of my review, I'm not an avid gamer, so I wasn't going to spend $$$ on a fancy keyboard.The only downside that some gamers may experience is the lighting mode. The lights are multicolored LEDs, and are on as long as the keyboard is plugged in. There is no way to turn them off and you cannot have just a single color at once. It's either all or nothing. I don't see this as a problem, though, as I actually like the multicolored LEDs and it adds ambiance to the room, especially when I'm watching Netflix in the dark!Overall, excellent product at an excellent price! Durable, lightweight, and great design! I also like how it has the little \"feet\" on the back to prop it up, unlike my old el cheapo keyboard that just lay flat on the desk, which makes it a lot easier to type. All in all, highly recommended!",

Love the look.However, the instant I hooked up the keyboard, I realized the comma key didn\u2019t work. It has to be tapped like 3-4 times in order for it to place a comma in whatever I\u2019m typing. I\u2019m too busy to deal with a return, so I just kept using the keyboard.Also, within the last month or so (like 2 months after purchasing it) the lettering on the A and S keys are worn off so you can\u2019t tell what letter they are. Super frustrating, given that this keyboard was not super cheap and also looks so darn cool.Also wish it was a better fit for my small hands, but I get that that\u2019s a special request. All in all a good keyboard with the exception of those two issues.",

                "reviewText": "After using this keyboard for a couple months I feel I have put it through its paces. The keyboard is lightweight and a much welcome bonus of being waterproof. There are little holes behind the keys to allow the liquid to drop out. That was probably my favorite feature that I didn\u2019t know about until reading the box. The backlighting is set and can\u2019t be changed, I am disappointed that in a gaming keyboard the wasd keys aren\u2019t a different color or somehow highlighted. That seems like a must in my mind for a keyboard sold as a gaming keyboard. But in all actuality it doesn\u2019t affect performance, in that regard the keys are very clicky and have a nice feel. I\u2019ve always been heavy handed in typing and these have a satisfying key throw. Key presses were registering nice and fast, no noticeable lag. Since it doesn\u2019t have any super fancy features there is no extra software needed and should just plug and play into any computer. The build quality seemed to be good , I didn\u2019t feel like I would break it easily.",

                "reviewText": "PRO's: I love the keyboard...big letters to see and a light you can turn on or off. It's quiet typing if you are not a heavy hitter. It's pretty basic.CONS: The switch to turn the keyboard light on or off was hard to locate and seems a little easy to break if not careful. There is no volume control or mute button. While playing a game, I use the arrow keys for movement but the space bar for jumping however when you are using your left hand for the arrow keys and your right hand for the mouse, using the Space bar is hard to reach to press. Perhaps a longer space bar and the ALT Windows and Ctrol button smaller, actually you don't need the windows key on the right side.OVERALL: Great basic keyboard that's lit! Keys feel well made and not cheap, the overall frame is well made and is weighted perfectly...not sliding around on the table, however I have a mat under it but non the less, I went through 3 keyboards finding this one to be the best.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first keyboard that I purchased for personal use. The RGB backlighting on the keyboard is dim and subdued, which is something that I personally like when I use my computer at night. The keys are very responsive, relatively quiet but still has a satisfying click, and have an overall comfortable feel. The keyboard is also lightweight which can be off-putting for some expecting a heavier keyboard. Even after letting 3 of my friends borrow this keyboard and use it for a week the general consensus is the keyboard has a great quality despite it's price. Only downside I've encountered was the exclusion of a function key (which I need to use to change the function keys from media key to function keys). Definitely a good purchase for people who are on a budget but want a good keyboard.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great little, comfortable, light and illuminated budget keyboard for any purpose.The buttons are sturdy and travel enough down to give you a good feel while typing, especially if faster. The illumination is nice and gentle on the eyes in low lighting conditions yet perfect for typing in even pitch black if you wish. Illumination is activated by a little switch in the upper right corner.The keyboard is otherwise very quiet, very soft to touch thanks to that good coating on the surface (which I hope lasts before it gets all shiny and slippery :)). Overall, prolonged typing on this is great and doesn't fatigue me.As with every keyboard, due to differing positions of the \\ button and shape of Enter, it can take just a bit of time to adjust so that your fingers are reaching for the correct spot.I would say this keyboard works great for a gamer like me, but if you like more function buttons for WOW-type games, you won't find this adequate. I find it fine for me to play games like Skyrim or Fallout. The keys aren't stretched at all so the spacing is small enough that you don't have to reach too far from the WASD to access 10+ other commands/functions.But some function keys like for playing/pausing videos or music, opening calculator, adjusting volume, screen brightness, etc., are missed.Didn't test the spill-proof nature :) But I had a keyboard in the past that had this feature and actually could go into top rack of a dish-washer. It worked great for years. This one has the similar feel so no reason it shouldn't work just as well.The key thing for which I would give this 5 stars is the customer support!I received my first keyboard with a few buttons not functioning. I immediately reached out to customer service and they responded promptly, first asking to test a few things and send them a picture (in which I pointed out what wasn't working). Within 3 days from starting my communication with them, I had my replacement keyboard.Very happy with courtesy and speed of resolution.Would buy again!",

I am happy with my purchase.My only issue are the lights, since you can only turn them ON/OFF, without being able of configuring the light intensity (until there's some hidden feature I didn't know about). So now on the day, when the lights are not needed, the intensity is OK, but for night when you need the lights turned ON, the light intensity is too high. That's my only complain for now (1 week using the product).",
