Dongle is inside the mouse (got nervous mine was missing for a minute) numbers and letters are stickers though so keep that in mind. But it\u2019s beautiful and lightweight. Backspace button is small that\u2019s really the only \u201ccomplaint\u201d I have.",

                "reviewText": "This is not a defect, just flawed design! Most of the Fn keys are sound and music related (which I think would be useful for people who frequent with audio visual work) but for typical WFM use, it\u2019s not useful. I love the calculator and lock buttons, more importantly, missing CTRL (windows) and FN (mac) buttons on the right. I like to type with both keys on each side as it\u2019s awkward relying on one side of the keyboard to do so. These are just some of the \u201cnit picky\u201d items I identified that led me to purchase a very similar product but different brand (joy access) to go with instead. I just looooved the purple color on this one and it breaks my heart at the thought of needing to return because it doesn\u2019t fulfill my needs, hence the 4 stars.In terms of functionality, it types well, it looks sleek, it feels comfortable, and it works!",

                "reviewText": "Function of keys:I am a student, and I use \"copy/paste\" with control V and control C at least 100 times a day. This keyboard is missing the control key on the right side. In place of it is a key that gives a drop-down list where you may arrow down and choose copy or paste and other options. I cannot get used to using the control key on the left side versus the right. I don't need this key (see the arrow in my photo) when I can just right-click my mouse instead. For this reason, I will be returning the keyboard and mouse, yet I should have noticed this prior to purchase.NOTE: Pay attention to all the function keys, and do they fit your needs? For me, the numeric keypad is a must!Keystroke:The mechanism that makes the keys respond to touch is 'switch'. I'm learning that rubber dome switches, scissor switches, and mechanical switches are the primary types of switches used by most manufacturers. The switches make all the difference in sensitivity, level of noise, and comfort. I like that this keyboard uses scissor switches; it's comfortable and quiet to type.Design:The mouse is great, and I like the finish of the keys; they have a matte finish that has a good feel while typing. This keyboard has a sleek design and is lightweight.Because I suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome, I'm realizing I'd be better off with an ergonomic keyboard, which is designed to position your hands naturally and reduce strain by offering a proper wrist rest to maximize comfort.Compatibility:Wireless keyboards connect to the system via Bluetooth and can be somewhat tricky to setup, unlike plug-and-play USB cord keyboards, yet I had no issues with setup. Make sure you have AA batteries, and conveniently, there is only one USB receiver that controls both the keyboard and the mouse.",

I'll stop it before I go to sleep to conserve the battery. I already keep a 20 pack of AA batteries in a drawer anyway so there's no worries.Overall I'm very happy with it.

So far, I am pleased with the product. It has a number of things that I like:- the keyboard is compact with a nice color and look, which fits great next to my Macbook.- the keyboard has soft clicks, which is similar to my keyboard at the office, so I like it. When typing fast, you might feel that the keys and the whole keyboard is slightly wiggly, which is fine to me but might feel weird for some pple.- The mouse has silent clicks as well, which is good when working late at home.- the Bluetooth setup is simple, the keyboard shortcuts work with iOS (e.g., the cmnd key), the mouse sometimes experience some lags, which is not a big deal, unless if you want to pay games online.- Although the keyboard setup and key size/location might feel different, I have already got used to it quickly. Also, I like the extended number pad. which helps me enter numbers quicker and easier.So, to summarize, you need to try it to see if it works with you as people may have different expectations",

Only difference is that the backspace button is half-size so sometimes i hit delete when meaning to hit backspace.The mouse is perfect - I have a relatively large hand and it fits just fine...I like that i can change the scrolling responsiveness.You really can't go wrong if you want a small (compact, low profile) keyboard with numberpad that works like a full-size one and actually looks good.",

Space bar gives a miss many times while typing. I had liked the whole look and size provided it had worked properly.What I like is the fact that it looks neat and is silent but one has to get used to the layout. Not having Ctrl key on the right side is very frustrating while typing. The arrow keys are too small for continuous use.Edited : Cancelled the return as after using it for a few days the keys have become a little better and I have re-mapped the right menu key to ctrl and it works for me.It seems to be a good buy at 1287 ( under 1300) for me but if it was more, then definitely no. I does not deserve to be more expensive than this price ( as I saw a different colour of the same keyboard listed as 11,000 something and even this model was later listed at around 8000 before going out of stock)All in all , an ok product. takes a while getting used to the layout and response.A delicate looking piece meant for easy use. For someone who types so regularly and vigorously like me, its a good change but I plan to move to a mechanical soon , so a good stop gap arrangement.",
