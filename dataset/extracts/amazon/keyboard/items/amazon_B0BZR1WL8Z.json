                "reviewText": "Product malfunctioned out of the box. Keyboard arrived with a good handful of keys not working properly. Pressing down on the key results in multiple keys being outputted at once. I cannot use keys such as (U, I, O, J, K, M) which means that the keyboard is pretty much useless for practical use. I bought this keyboard specifically to use for gaming purposes, however I'm unable to use several keys that I need to for gaming. The keyboard is very aesthetically pleasing it's just a shame that I won't be able to use it. Troubleshooted every possible software issue and to no avail. Even removing the keycaps and pressing down on the red switches still results in the same issue. Buy at your own risk. I sent a message to the seller but have yet to get a reply back.",
