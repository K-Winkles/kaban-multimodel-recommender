They said if it was not the right product or think it still works.. they will re-charge me for it. I love it, so why would I return it if it worked fine??",

Not sure if it's the keyboard itself or the bluetooth connection (as others have noted here). I like the quiet keys, but the typos created by the keyboard's inability can be incredibly frustrating. I missed the return window so I am still trying to make this work, but it's likely I will donate the keyboard and purchase anoher.

It arrived in the manufacturer\u2019s box and had gotten beat up a bit in transit. It has a lot if bend and just feels cheap. I do like that seeing that it\u2019s battery operated (2xAA) it turns itself off when not in use and turns back on as soon as you press a key. The switches are nothing to write home about but as i said for a full size, inexpensive keyboard it gets the job done. As i do work on a computer daily i will definitely be buying a better keyboard with a bit bigger keys and better switches. If you don\u2019t need a quality keyboard then this one does work fine, it just isn\u2019t meant for day to day use.",
