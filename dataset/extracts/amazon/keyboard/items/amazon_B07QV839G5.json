                "reviewText": "Because it certainly doesn't feel or look cheap. It looks higher end than it is.I've been using it for a little while, before deciding to write a review, and I love it just as much now as when I first got it. The keys are clacky, in a pleasing textile-ish kind of way, if you like that, but also not obnoxiously loud at the same time. I did notice the space bar is a bit springier sounding than the other keys like others have said, but I honestly don't even think about it when I'm using it anymore. The contrast of the white keys against the stainless is very aesthetically pleasing. I wish it had dedicated volume buttons, but I'll live. Because the keys are raised, I find it very easy to dust when cleaning--it even includes a cleaning brush to get between the keys, which I thought was a nice touch. The different light modes are fun, though I usually just keep them stationary. It just makes my work area a little more playful, and I love that because it's so me. I don't know much about gaming keyboards or what actually makes a keyboard a **gaming** keyboard, so maybe those who are more hardcore might be able to pick it apart. But I bet a kid would absolutely love this. I'm 38 and I sure do!Edit: I just sat down at my desk and realized I've been using this keyboard more than 6 months now, so I thought I'd come back to update. I still love it! It's really easy to type with, not a difficult adjustment going from my work computer to home. The clack of the keys is very satisfying for me. All the keys still work great and no letters have even begun to wear down. It cleans up really easy with a duster as well. I hope it continues to hold up so well, but honestly, even if it stopped working tomorrow, I'd probably still order it again because I like it so much!",

                "reviewText": "I had a Logitech wireless keyboard for years and it finally started to fail me. It was an efficient little keyboard but I never took advantage of the wireless-ness. I use the keyboard strictly for work - I'm never sitting on my couch with a keyboard in my lap.I received this keyboard last night (1-day shipping, super fast) and after a morning working on the keyboard, I knew I needed to leave a review immediately.Aesthetically the keyboard is gorgeous. The silver panel is really sleek and modern and plays well with the reflection of the colored lights. I thought about making my own little video but really, what's the point? It looks exactly as it does in the photos as it does in person. As others have said, the keys make a nice satisfying click (I much prefer a mechanical -click- over the taps of the new flat Mac keyboards) but is not excessively loud. I also like that the keys are not printed but cut outs in the key cap which makes me believe there will be no room for smudging letters or discoloration.Initially I was a little disappointed when I realized that there were no multimedia functions on this keyboard, I used the volume control/mute buttons on the Logitech daily. After perusing this page I realized there are multimedia controls but they do not work with Mac. HOWEVER, as the copy/paste functions and other standard Mac functions DO work on this keyboard, I of course gave it a try. I'm happy to report that the FN+F2 and F3 control the volume. From what I can tell, this keyboard works as well as any other Mac keyboard.From what I can tell, there are only a couple of small issues here:1. The keys are spread slightly further apart than a normal keyboard so they take a tiny bit of getting used to. I am an advanced typist and have had only the smallest learning curve in terms of getting used to it.2. The spacebar is making a very small squeaking noise when tapped in a certain space. This might be able to be fixed if I pop it off and adjust it? Not sure, not a gamer and taking keys off of keyboards is not something I normally do.Otherwise, a really beautiful and functional piece of office equipment and quite a bargain too!! Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Delivery was faster than originally estimated which made it that much more exciting to receive. Directions and upkeep are easy to understand and small steps which I love lol. It has multiple functions and can be used for everyday typing or gaming. I wfh, so I will be using it everyday regularly. It was easy to set up. I literally unplugged my old keyboard and plugged this one in and immediately began using. No issues and no hassle to get started with it.The lights are bright and colorful, but again, they can be adjusted- by color and by brightness. The clicking sounds are soft-sounding, but for me, just enough clackity to get that productive and asmr feel going! The keys are a bit lifted which can take adjusting to if not used to higher up keys versus flat keys, but it's not a complaint- just to give an awareness.Definitely would recommend purchasing for self or gifting for another!",

I was debating between a lot of them but I'm glad I decided on this one.It's def a more soft click and feels really nice to use, still getting used to it since I just started using it today but the colours are very nice and you can change the brightness, the breathing speed and have the lights off, on or breathing.Feels super nice to type on and just looks super nice, doesn't have the neon lights most keyboards due and I love the green and orange it has. Also its suuper light. Highly recommend it. (:",
