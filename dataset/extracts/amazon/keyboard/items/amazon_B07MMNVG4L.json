                "reviewText": "I was looking for a low-profile, low key travel keyboard for use with rhythm games that felt similar to my Lenovo laptop's keyboard. The TrackPoint Keyboard II is an amazing keyboard for daily use, but has ~30 ms of input lag that makes it inadequate for rhythm games, so I decided to try this Lenovo 300 USB Keyboard instead.Basically, it's the same sort of layout as any Lenovo keyboard, but is overly mushy, making it a worse experience than the built-in laptop keyboard or the TrackPoint Keyboard II.If you want a Lenovo keyboard around this price, the Lenovo Preferred Pro I and II are much better, being two of the best membrane keyboards available. And if you need a low-profile laptop-style keyboard, I'd just pony up the extra money for a TrackPoint Keyboard II, which regularly goes on sale for $80. And finally, if you need a good keyboard specifically for rhythm games, like I did, I highly recommend the Corsair K100 Air, but it is pretty expensive.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had quite a few IBM & Lenovo laptops and ThinkPads. THIS Lenovo keyboard is wired and connected to my older Lenovo 520 ThinkPad with Windows 7 Pro\u2026AND a good sized monitor for the old eyes. There just gets to be things we are comfortable with, right? (FYI. I DO know that Windows 11 is available but I don\u2019t need it because my other puter is an iMac.). This keyboard feels like a IBM/Lenovo because it is a Lenovo. Response, size, etc. I even caught a sale. Hope this helps some folks!",
