                "reviewText": "Good keyboard overall. Pretty small, just like I wanted it, takes some getting used to after using one with a number pad on the right. Came with 2 batteries and the dongle of course. Only major downside for me is that the ON/OFF switch is located UNDER the keyboard (see pic), requiring me to have to feel for it/look for it. Takes a few seconds, so not a big deal. I just feel like it's be better for it to be located directly behind the keyboard and have a better design for switching it off and on. Red light comes on for just a few seconds to indicate power then turns off. The sides of the keyboard feel a little sharp, giving it a cheap feel. It's super lightweight and the clacking of the keyboard isn't too loud for me personally.I have bought a mouse and dongle from ARTECK before and honestly expected keyboard that was just as smooth and well thought out as the mouse I have from them. This product feels a little ways away from perfection but I'm sure with some minimal design changes, it would be the best keyboard for me. I will keep using it and see if how I feel changes in regards to the switch and overall feel. Still pretty good nonetheless for the price point.",

                "reviewText": "It probably weighs less than two grams, and sits at an angle, up in the back, down in the front, so I absolutely wouldn't use it at a desk or as a daily driver, but it works great for a media center PC or a Steam Deck (or other portable PC without a keyboard) that doesn't require frequent keyboard use. The on/off switch is on the bottom, and it's difficult to switch, which is a positive given some of the boards I've used have had on/off switches loosen and stop working over time, which I definitely don't forsee being a problem with this one. Media keys on the F-key row are what you need, and nothing more, which is nice. It's almost exactly the size of a Steam Deck, so it fits perfectly in Deck specific travel bags. Overall, it's a perfect, no-nonsense, low-cost solution.",

LOL very flimsy, probably pretty breakable from children. not drop safe, nor any accident safe. a dog would demolish it. \ud83e\udd23 it probably would survive a drop test, but only 1. Did NOT survive a drop test. \ud83d\ude09 it works for what I need it for. it's a keeper for me UPDATE. I dont recommend this one for anyone. the only thing i use it for is so i dont have to stand up, lean over my vdrums, to get to my laptop to type things in . puter sits in front of me on a music stand, no where else to put it.i decided to try a portable keyboard, does make my life easier & more comfortable. however, this is not the one. il be buying another, not this one. when i get the the next one, this one goes in the trash. its not even good enough to donate. thats bad. you get what you pay for, but this isnt even worth the few bucks it costs. bummer.",

I didn't realize that being scaled down means my muscle memory is no longer accurate and so I often find myself mistyping. But again, I got it because it was small so it feels unfair to complain.It also seems to work just fine on a desk but I got a portable one so I can use it on the go, and often have the keyboard on my lap. When I do this, it doesn't seem to register very well, and I need to tip it at an angle before my computer will read it without delays or errors. A stronger signal would be really helpful and add a lot of versatility, since if I wanted to put it on a desk I'd just get a full sized or even wired keyboard.Otherwise it's cute and the battery lasts pretty well. USB-C charging would be cool though.",

Da ich sie nur hin und wieder an meinem PC zum Spielen benutze, habe ich keine allzu hohen Anspr\u00fcche oder Erwartungen. Und tats\u00e4chlich wurden meine Erwartungen auch nicht \u00fcbertroffen.Diese Tastatur hier sieht meiner Mac-Tastatur recht \u00e4hnlich. Nun ja, auf den ersten Blick jedenfalls.Gleiche Breite, gleiche H\u00f6he, \u00e4hnlich gro\u00dfe Tasten. W\u00e4hrend ich mit meinem Mac-Brett aber N\u00e4gel in die Wand schlagen kann, w\u00fcrde das mit der Tastatur hier nicht wirklich klappen.Sie quietscht und klappert fr\u00f6hlich vor sich hin, dazu wellt sich die rechte Seite ein wenig nach oben. Ach so, sie l\u00e4sst sich auch mit ein wenig Druck durchbiegen.Alles keine allzu rosigen Voraussetzungen.Aber: man darf niemals den Preis vergessen. Diese Tastatur kostet keine 20 Euro, die Funkverbindung zum Rechner klappt tadellos und schreiben l\u00e4sst sich auch sehr gut damit.Ben\u00f6tige ich sie nicht mehr, l\u00e4sst sich sich in Windeseile in der Schublade verstauen.Ich finde, f\u00fcr den Preis habe ich eine schlechte Verarbeitung bekommen, kann mit der Tastatur aber alles an meinem PC tun, was ich m\u00f6chte.Nachtrag nach zwei Monaten:Ich benutze diese Tastatur nun seit mehr als zwei Monaten t\u00e4glich. Bis auf die etwas abenteuerliche Verarbeitung habe ich in dieser Zeit nicht einen Negativpunkt entdecken k\u00f6nnen. Sie ist zuverl\u00e4ssig, kompakt, weder beim Spielen oder Schreiben ist auch nur ein Tastaturanschlag danebengegangen.F\u00fcr mich ebenso wichtig ist, dass sie so sch\u00f6n kompakt ist.Wenn man Preis und Leistung betrachtet, dann w\u00fcrde ich sie mir wohl wieder kaufen.",
