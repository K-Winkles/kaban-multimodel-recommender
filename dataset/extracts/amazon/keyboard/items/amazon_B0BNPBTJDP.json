It comes in a colorful, very easy to open box.The texture of the keyboard is soft and easy to type on with good travel distance when keys are pressed. the backlit colors is also very good and its brightness can be adjusted with 4 levels as well as a 7 colors to choose from or you can simply switch the backlit off.The empty space available in the keyboard was very handy I used it with my 11 inch windows tablet.It is very easy to connect to a PC, laptop or a tablet. Just plug the wireless adapter and it is ready to use.Note: In case you have an iPad you can also use the accompanied converter to convert from USB-A to USB-C so your iPad can recognize it. this Converter can also be used to convert any USB-A to USB-C adapters.Did I mention that this keyboard comes with a rechargeable battery! The battery life is very good, I'm still using it since I charged it for the first time.The Keyboard is also equipped with many shortcut keys that will make typing and using on supported OS a nice experience, thanks to the accompanied Manual that was easy to read and direct to the point.All in all it was a good experience and I would like to thank the seller for this nice product. Finally I have a suggestion it would be nice to include a trackpad to the newest model of this keyboard as I feel adding a trackpad will make it superb to other keyboards out there.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this keyboard for work, not gaming. It gets full use for 3-5 days per week, about 10 hours per day (30-50 hours per week). Overall, good for the price. Knocked a star because of the battery life not meeting expectations - I did not go back and read what the claim was so this could be consumer preference/error!Pros: Comfortable, responsive key strokes, multiple color customization options, backlight turns off when low on battery life, pen holder slot so it doesn't get lost in my deskCons: Keys are a little loud but I think I'm a strong typer. Battery life is short lived in comparison to other keyboards I've had. It has to be charged every few days, but still operational while charging.",

Only dislike which is not that big of a deal is that I would have like to have control over how long keyboard stays lit before going off. I just hit control or windows key to bring it back on without effecting a current document. Other than that, I love the keyboard response better than my previous more expensive one which just crapped out on me after 3 years.",

                "reviewText": "Update: after 6 weeks of use the keyboard stopped lighting, I reached out to the company and only needed to unplug and reconnect the usb receiver. The lights immediately returned!This keyboard is the same size as normal full-sized keyboards with the exception of being lighter in weight. The keys are very easy to type, as it doesn't require much pressure. As for being quiet, the keys are quieter than most, but the space bar seems to be louder than the other keys. I love the color and brightness choices. The keyboard will auto shutoff the backlit light within two minutes, but will immediately turn on with the press of a key. I have been using the keyboard at work for two weeks without an extra charge needed but I can't attest to how the performance of the battery life will be at this time. So far, I a very pleased with this keyboard.",
