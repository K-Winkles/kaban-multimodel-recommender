                "reviewText": "For context, I'm not an RK fangirl, and have had honestly pretty bad experiences with their keyboards in the past. I bought this keyboard a couple of weeks ago closer to when it came out. I mostly bought this keyboard to replace an aging Keychron K2, and decided to take a plunge with this one because I liked the keycaps and design of this keyboard, and I was a specifically looking for a keyboard that had side printed legends that matched the firmware. I've been around the custom keyboard block and I'm sick of having to memorize key combos for system functions, changing rgb, etc. Guess I'm getting older lmao.I bought the version with the brown switches. Upon inspection these appear to be Outemu browns with the RK branding on them. They were surprisingly okay. The tactility was a bit better than gateron browns. They're perfectly fine, but the appeal of hotswap is being able to change the switches. I changed mine to Akko Lavender switches, which went completely fine. No issues in the keycap or switch pulling processI can't confirm the keycap material anywhere, but if I had to guess, they're a high quality ABS instead of PBT. Double shot, as can be seen from the pictures. The casting isn't the best when looked at from the bottom, but I'll never see it and it doesn't affect the weighting of the keys. The color scheme is gorgeous to me. And there's still a good thock sound because I know us keyboard nerds care about that.Stabilizers are pretty good. They're not screw in as far as I can tell. They're very solid though and there's no rattle.The switch mounting plate was what surprised me the most. It appears to be some kind of polycarbonate with slats cut into it. It definitely adds to a slightly softer typing feel and better sound. I used to think this kind of mounting plate was a bit silly, but I'm quite pleased with this one.The RGB gets pretty bright. Pattern variety and color variety is about average, but the lighting quality itself is good. I didn't try any of the software that RK makes for their keyboard with this. I honestly loathe installing software for peripherals unless there's macros I need, and the RK software in the past had given me some issues with the RK61 I had.If you care about the lift up feet, they're really solid on this keyboard. Borderline actually hard to flip in and out. I'm expecting those to stay solid for a long time.The knob and OLED screen. Oh boy these are actually really good. To turn the keyboard on and off, just hold the knob down. Rotate the knob to change the volume on whatever device it's connected to. Press the knob to open a list of connection options (wired, 2.4ghz, BT). To re-pair bluetooth just hold the knob down when the cursor is over one of the BT options. If you change between mac and windows mode, the keyboard will remember which OS mode it was in for each connection option, which is excellent for switching between a Windows PC, a work Mac, and my iPad. Btw, mac mode does swap the function and media keys from windows mode, so you have to use fn to access the function keys. This is pretty normal mac behavior on other keyboards (nuphy, keychron, etc). Just something to be aware about. The OLED display is informative and shows connection, OS mode, battery life.Battery life is pretty good. Got about a week to ten days of wireless with RGB at full brightness on the waterfall pattern. I'd imagine I could get a month with the RGB off.Gaming latency is fine. Feels similar to an RK61 on all three connection modes. The wired mode is fast enough for FPS games, but if you're really sweaty I'd start looking into keyboards designed specifically for low latency gaming. The wireless 2.4ghz is fast enough for casual games, but not competitive FPS games at all. BT is too slow for gaming, as expected.Overall, I'd recommend this keyboard. I got it at the launch discount with a coupon, which was an excellent price. At its current MSRP, I'd say it's pretty good. There's a lot of quality of life features and things keyboard nerds care about. There's a lot of features on here that you'd really only find on more expensive boards and custom boards. The OLED screen and knob are pretty unique and the biggest selling point for this board imo, but the overall design and color is what's keeping me around. Also it thocks.",

Stock it feels very good and comfortable to type on, and it sounds much more expensive that it actually is. The RGB colors are very bright (but a limited color selection). The size of the keyboard is perfect as you get all of the convenient function keys and still save space with no numpad. The sound is kind of higher pitched clicky almost with cherry mx browns. The keycaps are high quality and the color of the keyboard is a cool blue and gray theme. The switcher knob is very easy to use and easily switches between Bluetooth, dongle, and USB. The battery on the keyboard lasts a long time before needing recharge. Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase and if you get this keyboard on sale it is a steal!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars So Satisfying!",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. My previous keyboard before this was also a Royal Kludge, but it was a 60% interface and had red switches. It was okay, but I missed having the separate function keys, and the red switches weren't quite what I wanted. I type a lot on my online classes, and the red switches kept making me do typos because the keys were so easy to activate. I've tried blue switches, and while they were satisfying to hear at first, the noise quickly got distracting. So this time I thought I'd try out the brown switches, and they're perfect for me! They're not as loud as blue switches, but still make a satisfying \"clunk\" sound. They also require a little bit more force to activate than the red switches, which is perfect for any typist like myself. I am a casual gamer as well, and although I haven't gamed with this keyboard yet, I know it will work perfect for me. For the more fast-paced games and extreme gamers, the red or silver switches would do well.Now on to the keyboard itself: it's beautiful! The keys are thick and high-quality, the colors match my purple/kawaii/retro setup nicely, the base is heavy (not too heavy) and durable, and the knob is super convenient. The knob makes it easy to switch modes and to change the volume on my computer. The plastic cover is nice to have since I eat at my desk sometimes. If you download the keyboard software free from their website, it is easy to setup a color scheme with near infinite choices. I like the solid purple for now as it matches my setup, but I'll probably change the color/scheme down the line.Overall, this keyboard is the best keyboard I've typed on ever! I can tell the cost is put toward the quality of this keyboard.",

Wanted to try out a board that wasn't so clicky and loud like blue switches. In terms of response times for games, when I was playing OSU I actually did better with these red switches than blues.For games I'd recommend only playing it plugged in else it does have a bit of latency over blutooth or 2.4ghz.The build is solid and I love the sound of the keys and switches right out of the box. I was thinking maybe I'd have to start customizing it from the get-go but I'm very happy with it as it is.Definitely would recommend to anyone especially when the keyboard has the $40 off coupon available on it.",

The keycaps are of high quality and look really cool aswell and the keyboard itself sounds really nice not too loud but a nice and satisfying sound when you bottom and top out on the key strokes. The wirless is really good aswell and the little screen and Knob features on this keyboard make it a killer keyboard for a really good price I cannot recommend this keyboard enough! The only gripe I have with this keyboard is the space bar is just much louder than the rest of the keyboard and sounds a tad hollow but thats easy enough to fix on your own and it really isn't that bad to be entirely honest.",
