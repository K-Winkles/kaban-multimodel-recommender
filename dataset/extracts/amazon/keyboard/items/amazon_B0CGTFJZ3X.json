                "reviewText": "I have the blue switch version of this keyboard. I am using it with an iMac desktop computer. I really enjoy clicky keys, and this keyboard provides satisfaction in that area! They did provide a small cheat sheet that explains various keyboard functions. It also comes with a key puller which could be useful when you need to clean the keyboard. The keyboard is backlit, however, the lights pulsate in a wave pattern from left to right. You can control the speed in which they pulsate, but I could not find any way to make the lights stop pulsating. The only other option is to turn the lights off. I only used the keyboard in a well lit room, so perhaps using it in a darker room might cause you some annoyance. The keyboard is much heavier than the standard keyboard that comes with an iMac. It also has non slip feet which prevent it from moving as I type.One other thing I want to mention. I plugged in the keyboard and started using it immediately. There was a pop up which states that the keyboard will not work unless you download their software, however, I clicked cancel and the keyboard still works fine. If you choose to download their software for this keyboard, then I would caution you to read all of the fine print as you want to be careful what kind of access you give them.Overall, I really like this mini keyboard. It doesn't take up a lot of space on my desk. I enjoy the clicky sounds. I wish the lights were constant and not pulsating, but it's not bothersome to me. The various key functions were not too difficult to figure out either.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using the KEMOVE K61SE Gaming Keyboard for a few weeks now, and I'm thoroughly impressed. Transitioning from a full-sized keyboard, the smaller footprint of this 60 percent mechanical keyboard was immediately noticeable. It freed up so much desk space without sacrificing the essential keys needed for both gaming and everyday typing.The blue switches are a standout feature for me. For those who might not be familiar, blue switches are known for their tactile feedback and audible clicky sound with each keystroke. This provides a satisfying typing experience, especially for someone who spends hours at the keyboard. The tactile response has improved my typing accuracy and speed, making it a joy to use for both long gaming sessions and typing tasks.One of the initial concerns I had was adjusting to the lack of arrow and F keys, which are omitted to achieve the keyboard's compact size. However, I found that the learning curve was quite manageable. The keyboard's design smartly incorporates secondary functions for these missing keys, which are easily accessible through combination keystrokes. After a short period of adjustment, I hardly noticed their absence, thanks to the intuitive layout.The LED backlit feature is another highlight, offering customizable lighting options to suit my mood or match my gaming setup. It's not just about aesthetics; the backlighting also makes it easier to use in low-light conditions, ensuring I never miss a key.The N-Key Rollover functionality is crucial for gaming, allowing me to press multiple keys simultaneously without missing a command. This feature has been flawless in execution, ensuring that every key press is registered accurately, no matter how frantic the gaming action gets.Despite its compact size, the KEMOVE K61SE doesn't feel cramped. The build quality is solid, and the keys are well-spaced, making for a comfortable typing experience. It's compatible with both Mac and Windows, ensuring versatility across different operating systems without any hassle.In conclusion, the KEMOVE K61SE Gaming Keyboard has exceeded my expectations. It strikes the perfect balance between form and function, with the tactile and auditory satisfaction of the blue switches being a major plus for me. The smaller footprint, combined with the keyboard's high performance and customization options, makes it a standout choice for anyone looking to upgrade their gaming or typing setup. Highly recommended for its impressive blend of design, functionality, and performance.",

                "reviewText": "I have a couple mechanical keyboards in my collection. An old brown switch Rosewill from the days when Newegg was awesome, a custom WASD that cost me way more than I'd like to admit, also with the brown switches, a classic IBM buckling spring assault keyboard (seriously, it's made of stamped steel and weighs enough to sink a medium sized canoe), a standard dome switch TypeMatrix keyboard with weird layout options... plus a few other unremarkable keyboards. And typewriters, I forgot about those, I have a few of them too because you may have guessed, I like typing implements.I'm also extra weird when it comes to keyboards because I use dvorak layout without matching keycaps because, well, I decided to switch one day and I really don't want to switch back now. Not because it's better, but because it would be annoying to switch layouts again. I thought about using colemak, or an even more esoteric layout, but I'm too far gone now and there's no turning back...I spend most of my day typing on a computer, so given the aforementioned keyboard experience and the fact that I type, like, a whooooole lot (case in point: this review), I think I'm qualified to have an opinion about this particular piece of hardware. And what, you may ask, is my professional opinion about this keyboard? I immediately fell in love with it.Why? Well, for one thing, I thought the red switches weren't going to be my bag. I like the clickity-clack sounds from my other mechanical keyboards, so I was skeptical. But honestly, I like them quite a bit. They have this weight to them that you don't get with other types of key switches and it's supremely satisfying to type on it.In terms of build quality, this thing is so solid. It's heavy, the cord it comes with is braided and has a little velcro strap that keeps it nice and tidy. I'm not kidding, it's better quality than my WASD. And the backlight? Well, I've avoided backlights for a long time because I felt it was unnecessary. I still feel that way, but I will admit it's quite cool to look at and the animations are very smooth and satisfying.I can't think of anything wrong with this keyboard. At this price point, I was expecting, at best, a flimsy, just barely functional, bargain basement mechanical. What I got was so much more than that. In a blind test between this all of my other keyboards, if I didn't know any better, I would assume this was the most expensive one. Easily a 5/5 from me.Before you go, there are a few notes:- I didn't try any of the macro stuff. I don't care about macros, I don't game, and I have Linux so it was a moot point even if I did.- It's not wireless. I like it that way. You might not. The listing makes it clear. Pay attention to the details, silly goose.- The instruction manual is... more like a pamphlet. And when you go to see more information on their website, it's literally a PDF version of the thing that came in the box. Very not helpful. Then again, it is a keyboard. You push the buttons to make letters appear on the shiny box in front of your face. If they don't appear, you probably didn't plug it in.- If you've never used a reduced keyboard like this, and you rely on arrow keys or page up/down, home and end, you'll need to adjust. I knew this going in, but just be aware it's even more minimal than a laptop keyboard.",
