The DeLUX ergonomic keyboard outshined all others. I am adding picture - it's smaller than the Microsoft keyboard, it's very elegant, quiet, exactly as advertised. I am very happy with purchase. Personally, it was important to me that the keys have backlight. Really recommend to buy.",

                "reviewText": "I am working at home more now, and would like to get back to a ergonomic keyboard. At first this seem good, but there is just something about lacking a dedicated keys for Home, End PgUp and PgDn. Yes, this is not a full size keyboard, but it seemed that I can use keypad for same keys, but I do use keypad a lot. I searched more, and noticed other brands does have identical keyboard, but key layout is slightly different, where as they do have the keys I often use located the same place as the wireless modes (above keypad). I went with that instead, and that other brand of same keyboard had what I needed and at the same time was slightly lower cost. I went with it instead, but this isn't a bad keyboard at all, I just prefer to have keys I can get to. This still a very good ergo keyboard.",

I came across this one and decided to order it. I'm SO glad I did. I have used it for about a month and it helped with my shoulder and wrist pain. I noticed a difference within a week of using it. It wasn't as hard getting used to the keys as I thought it would be. It didn't slow my typing speed very much at all. I love typing on it. It is very quiet when you type. Also, it was super easy to connect and it has worked just fine. I have had no issues with the connection. The keys are backlit with white light, although I turn it off because my cubicle it well lit and there is no sense in keeping it on. I really like this keyboard and would recommend it.",

Delux moved the on/off switch to the back of the KB so it doesn't accidently turn on or off when sliding the keyboard.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this keyboard to replace an old wired ergonomic keyboard I used for my old Mac. I was happy it connected via bluetooth without a problem and most everything worked OK. The keys are definitely a little noisy - this is not as quiet as advertised but I can live with that. The main problem I encountered however, was that the NumLK simply does not work! Pressing it repeatedly makes no difference - the indicator light in the center of the keyboard does not come on. Usually, this would not have been a \"big deal\", but in this keyboard, which eliminated the stand-alone page up/down and home/end buttons and integrated them into the numbers pad on the side, you must use NumLK in order to use them. So my keyboard basically does not have page up/down or home/end functions (which on Office products are very useful). The manufacturer has no support; Amazon tried providing support but to no avail. They had me return the first keyboard and sent a new replacement. But the problem persists... the NumLK function simply does not work. I will have to return this one too and look for a different keyboard, unfortunately.",
