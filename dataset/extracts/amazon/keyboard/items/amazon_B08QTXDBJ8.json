                "reviewText": "My Logitech keyboard died a week before Thanksgiving. In an effort to escape Logitech's software (and modern hardware quality control), I decided to give the Razer Huntsman V2 (w/ Razer Red switches) a chance.Sure, it's not a custom mechanical setup with exotic Japanese switches, but it gives a premium enough feel. I love the sound dampening, the smoothness of the keys, and the relatively short actuation distance. It's not silent, per se, but it's the quietest keyboard in my house (including various laptops).I've seen comments online suggesting the keys don't light up bright enough. I'm partial to more subdued keyboard lighting, and I can vouch for the fact that I haven't had to dim the board much. Other brands use lighting that glows substantially around the keys, instead of just through the letters. Some of Razer's marketing images show bright halos around the keys, and some show none at all. In practice, they glow a little at the top of each key, but not very much at all.The only serious downside I encountered was with Razer's software. It's not very intuitive in general. But my specific complaint is that it isn't easy to use external tools to switch game profiles. I really wish these hardware companies would open source their software!Now, for why I returned it in a week. The Huntsman V2 Analog popped up on sale over Black Friday weekend for only a few buck more than I spent. I figured it was a no-brainer upgrade--how wrong I was.The analog version has added lighting around the base of the board (it looks great!) and offers analog functionality on every single key. Plus it has slightly stiffer springs. Unfortunately, it has none of the sound dampening of the regular Huntsman V2, and the keys give a loud, drum-like clack when bottomed out or rebounding.Analog, on a keyboard, is a bit of a gimmick, but one cool thing the analog version offers is adjustable actuation points. This gives you the ability to tune your typing and gaming experience.I agonized over the stiffer springs and loud typing. Ultimately, I returned the regular, quiet Huntsman V2 in favor of keeping the loud, but adjustable, Huntsman V2 Analog. Though I very seriously considered keeping both!!",

                "reviewText": "I really get bored with all black peripherals, so this keyboard really hit the spot. I have never played pubg but love yellow and black. I have to say this is the best keyboard that i have ever used, typing wise. The keys are really responsive and the dampening was just what the doctor ordered. In the past i have had many mass market keyboards and they were fine, but this is so far ahead of them that it silly that anyone would ever use a mass market keyboard. I also have a less than one year old expensive mechanical keyboard from another company and it does not compare with my new Huntsman. I could not type more than a couple of words on the other keyboard before i hit multiple keys and made a spelling mistake. The Huntsman is silky smooth, has a solid feel, and is very responsive. Before i bought this keyboard, i went online and watched videos on how to select the proper type of keys for your type of usage. This is what matched my usage and i ordered it without ever typing on one or seeing one in person. I definitely made a wise choice. So i would recommend that everyone do some research and make sure you are getting the right keyboard for your usage patterns since getting the wrong type of keyboard can make you miserable.",

                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying that this keyboard is a MUST for anyone! It is absolutely the best thing I have put my fingers on in quite a while......LOLFor the last 3 months I have been on the hunt for a keyboard that would meet all my crazy criteria...and I finally found it.First, some background: I am a software engineer and have been writing code and working at a desk in front a keyboard for the last 27 years, so a keyboard (and mouse) is my tool for the trade.In addition, I am extremely picky. More than just for the purpose of creature comforts, I look for \"utility\" in my tech and for things to be solid, good quality and made in a logical way.For a keyboard, I had this list of criteria:1. Backlit keys2. Quiet keys3. Primary dedicated media buttons that do NOT require a Fn/secondary key to be pressed for access.4. Easy volume controls5. Quiet keys6. Solid build that does not bend down with each key press7. Multi-colors for the backlit keys, if possible8. Quiet keys9. Mechanical-style keys (height and actuation)10. Properly spaced keys11. Quiet keys12. \"Linear\" Enter key (not \"L\" shape.....why...why?)Did I mention Quiet keys??? That actually should have been at the top of the list.I know it is a personal preference, and mine is not the clicky noise...it's just too distracting to me.Well, folks - this is it! This is the keyboard that answers ALL the criteria above.To date, I have tried over 20 keyboards and none hit the mark. I've tried cheap ones, medium and expensive ones. Couldn't find it until this.The keys are made of a nice material that provides just that little \"grip\" you need not to slide off of the surface.Actuation is amazing and the bottom of the key press is dampened (noise-side) in such a nice way that you can barely hear it. I really do mean barely!!SO many reviews and manufacturer write-ups talk about quiet keys...but they were not.This keyboard is absolutely that - quite and pleasant (if you can even say that).Keys are spaced out nicely and typing accuracy is very high.I particulary like the fact that I can set RGB values for the backlit color of the keys...that's just excellent.The software that gets installed by Razer is very good as well. Intuitive and gives you super control over every aspect of the keyboard.I've only had this keyboard ONE day, and already love it. If I think about it, I will return in 30 days and add an update.Price - I wasn't too \"comfortable\" with spending that type of cash for a keyboard...but now that it's here and I am typing this review with it...it was worth every penny! You DO get what you pay for.If you are in the market - spend the extra dollars and get this! You will NOT be disappointed!!! :)",
