                "reviewText": "This keyboard overall is very nice. I really like it white and all but these were the main drawbacks for me.I don't know how or what is happening at the factory but even after exchanging it, I find small black bits, some dirt marks on the keyboard, and scuffing on the plastic. The QC really isn't there for some odd reason and it being white makes it stand out more. Not much of a dealbreaker but is very odd indeed.The main reason I don't like the board is horrendous like the pinging or ringing sound when not seated firmly on a desk or something- the reverb of the click inside the keyboard and since it's metal or smth I assume that is what's making the sound. Once you notice it it's kind of right at you.I would say that if you can get past that sound thing (you can mod foam into it), or my anecdotal experiences with the cleanliness of the device upon reception, then it is a great keyboard. At its sale price, it is a fantastic piece of kit. Otherwise, regular price I would likely avoid it.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this keyboard because Corsair advertised the magnetic switches with custom actuation points as well as sound dampening inside the case so it wouldn't sound awful like all other gaming keyboards, but as usual with Corsair the product is overpriced and the quality control is a failure.Pros:-The switches seem nice and the actuation adjustment mostly works-The design and layout of the top plate is nice and I like the extra media keysCons:-iCUE software is terrible and makes this keyboard not worth it-Even though Corsair says they added foam and sound dampening, it still sounds loud and awful. It would be so easy to make these keyboards quieter and less annoying like small brand names do, but large brand names like Corsair/Razer don't seem to care and make terrible sounding products. You shouldn't be able to hear CLACK CLACK CLACK from 4 rooms away. I have a mechanical keyboard that cost one third the price and is silent, you can barely hear yourself typing on it-The wrist rest is too high for the keyboard, but you can just not use it if preferred-The price is way too high to justify spending on something with major issues-Firmware update doesn't work at all, causes the software to not recognize the keyboard and does nothing-Actuation colour settings don't actually work or do anything, you can change the setting but it never changes on the keyboard-iCUE tells you to save a profile to the board to use settings while iCUE is not running, but after saving profile to the board and your profile is shown under the \"On Board\" section of saved profiles, closing the iCUE software erases all settings and they don't actually stayThe firmware updater in iCUE is broken completely, it just causes the software to stop recognizing the keyboard and then nothing ever happens. If you close and restart iCUE it will open and prompt you to do the firmware update again because nothing ever updates and it doesn't work. If you click Update like it asks you, it just closes again and nothing happens. The only way to change any settings on the keyboard is to ignore the firmware update, as soon as you click Update the keyboard disappears from Devices but never updates or reappears.It also says you can save your profiles to the board and use your settings without the software running, but this doesn't work either. Even though my profile is saved under the on-board profiles section, closing the software immediately removes all the settings I saved. Pressing the profile key to switch to different profiles doesn't do anything either, my profile is gone completely until I relaunch iCUE.Like Razer Synapse this Corsair iCUE software is terrible bloatware and borderline spyware. At this point I'd rather just return the keyboard. What a terrible experience for over $300.",
