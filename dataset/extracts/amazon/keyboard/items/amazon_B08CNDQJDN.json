                "reviewText": "I have the nicer, hot-swappable RGB K10 model for home, and I wanted something similar for work but without all the bells and whistles. The Gateron Pro Brown switches are smooth and solid without being too loud. Keycaps have are textured but not rough (K10 keycaps are super smooth; I almost prefer this). The white backlight is nice, for dimmer work areas without adding RGB cost, and I never actually move my keyboard around, so unless you actually intend the keyboard to be mobile, the C series (which is wired only; USB-C) is perfectly fine and saves you some $$. Overall, while there are plenty of good mechanical keyboards, including some nicer Keychrons, I'm not sure there's a better choice for a basic, high-quality fullsize.",

                "reviewText": "Fist off the box the keyboard was in did not have shrink warping on it.The box also seemed to have a shipping label removed with the parts of it left behind and a lot of glue.Opening the box I found the keyboard was not in plastic as it should of been.The keyboard seemed fine and the box did have everything included.I bought the C2 Blue and have not had a mechanical keyboard in a very long time.I found this keyboard to have a great feel and for me, the blue keys were the way to go.It seems to be well made and enjoyed typing with it.The white backlight works well, just wish it had more range adjustment on the brightness levels.Travel of the keys is great and the clicky keys sound great too.I have to say for the price this keyboard is a good value for the money, I would of liked to have been able to get other color keycaps combo on order.I don't know how this keyboard would be for gaming, but think it would be ok in uses for games.I would have given a five star review if not for getting a sealed box.",

The sound of the keys is like Beethoven's 9th to my nerd ears. Love the options for the lighting effects and the size of the board is still compact but large enough to fit all the keys for my fat @55 fingers. For the price, you can't go wrong with this one.10/10",

                "reviewText": "***Update*** After 3 months of use, the new large keys with stabilizers are getting less squeaky. Not sure if it's the additional grease or it just needed to break in, but it is getting close to matching my older keyboard in sound and feel.I bought one of these in 2021 for my office at work. I love it, great value for the money, a joy to type on. I can type much faster on it than the e-waste $12 keyboard and mouse set they gave me.I decided to replace an aging Razor keyboard at home with the same model. Typing is great, but the spacebar has developed a very pronounced squeak. Very annoying. I tried a little white lithium grease on the plastic stabilizers, but it didn't help.I also have a K2 purchased in December 2020. It's held up very well.",
