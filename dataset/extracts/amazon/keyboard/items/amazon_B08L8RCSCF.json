                "reviewText": "I have the full-sized black wireless white backlit version with brown switches. I like the tactile, minimally clicky sound and feel. While not QUITE on par with the feel of actual Cherry MX Browns, these switches are pretty close. And frankly, I feel like that's a moderately subjective point.Pros:-Good weight-Solid construction-Responsive keys-Reasonably low actuation force on the primary keys-Space bar actuation force is a bit higher, which I appreciate-Good key travel distance-Strong tactile feedback-Decent double-shot keys-Excellent battery life-Zero board flexCons:-If charging, the cable must be connected to the computer (will not use the wireless function if plugged into a charger)-Backlight doesn't light the the [Fn] options on the keys (a common issue on most boards as they are not part of the double-shot process in most cases)-My cell phone near the receiver seems to cause missed keystrokes-Doesn't type my thoughts automatically (a great disappointment)For the money for a full-sized board, especially wireless, this is an excellent option. I have bought two of these: One for work, the other for home. I type a lot for a living (I work in knowledge management), and I feel like this board ups my typing speed a fair bit (no, I haven't done a full comparison). It's not perfect, but I feel like it compares well with my WASD wired keyboard.Battery life is about what they claim.NOTE: I don't really care about RGB. Frankly I consider it distracting. For a plain white backlight, I find this pretty solid, though not exceedingly bright. If you want a very bright backlight, this may not be your first choice.",

                "reviewText": "I was hesitant to buy a cheaper mechanical keyboard (and this is truly one of the cheapest options available) but I'm so happy I did.Everything about this model feels more expensive than it was. It's nice and heavy, with rubber feet that plant it solidly on the wood of my desk with no wobbling. The double shot PBTs feel great (although I did switch them out for blanks because I prefer no imprint.) The brown switches have been a dream - I am a data analyst who types 105 wpm, and having a quiet but tactile typing feel has been perfect for the hours I spent hammering away. The wireless connectivity has also been A+ - I popped the nano into my KVM switch and have had 0 issues since (another plus: the reviews for my KVM said that a few people with mechanical keyboards were unable to get them to register, but no problems from this model!)The C charging port is awesome. Like most people, my phone has a C port too, so whenever my keyboard dies I just pop the cable out of my fast charger and plug it in. As the description notes you can continue using it while it's charging, and I typically go several days (sometimes the full week) on a single charge. It doesn't warn you before it dies, but since the charging is so unobtrusive I have not had issues with that.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this keyboard, a wonder for the price. My boyfriend has been gaming with a Razer for awhile now, and once I got this he started playing around with it when I wasn't at my desk and has become a little obsessed.I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a clean typing experience and dependable useability.",

                "reviewText": "First unit I received was defective and would only work while plugged in, but return process was simple and I got a second unit within a week.Keycaps feel great; the legend backlight shine-through is a bit inconsistent in some spots, but perfectly readable. The backlight brightness is good. The included keycap puller is a nice touch; it's plastic and doesn't seem to scratch the keys, but can be a bit hard to use with certain keys like Esc where the key is surrounded by the plastic housing of the board. Wireless works pretty consistently; I've only experienced one intermittent drop for a few seconds, with the keyboard about two feet away from the dongle in the back of my PC. Charging is pretty fast, though I do wish the battery indicator was a bit more intuitive - it's just a red light underneath the space bar that lights up when the battery is low, and turns off once it's done charging. Media controls on the function row with F5 through F11 - strangely, the volume up and down controls are flipped from what I'm used to, with up being on the left and down on the right, but otherwise no complaints other than the F1-F4 shortcuts being things I'll never personally use. Putting custom macros on Fn-Q/W/E is nice to have but otherwise unremarkable.I use it for casual gaming and it works pretty well, but those who are super sensitive to input lag may want to look into a keyboard with wireless specifically designed for gaming use - or just use a wired one at this price. For productivity work (coding in my case), I think it's solid - pretty good tactile switches, solid build quality, no frills.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first mechanical keyboard. My friend kindly lent me her mechanical keyboard to try out and I fell in love with the tactile feel of the mechanical keyboard. I knew that I wanted a full sized keyboard, and I very much prefer one that is wireless. It wasn't that easy to find a wireless full sized mechanical keyboard that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, but this purports to be it. Even better, it is in white which fits the colour scheme of my home office set-up. The keyboard is awesome (and because it uses brown switches, quieter than the one I borrowed from my friend which makes this much more suitable for zoom calls), but I am disappointed that I cannot seem to get the wireless function to work.UPDATE: I have figured out how to get the wireless function to work - there is a tiny little switch on the bottom of the keyboard, and I just needed to flip the switch from \"off\" to \"on\". This wasn't in the manual so I completely overlooked it.",
