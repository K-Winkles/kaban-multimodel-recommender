                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Looks amazing and feels amazing. Very durable. Updated 12/5/19",
                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had this keyboard for about 3 1/2 months now. Thoughts and review below:Feel: It feels and looks extremely durable. It\u2019s quite heavy due to the material it\u2019s made out of which is great in my opinion. Typing on this is loud but it feels really good. Haven\u2019t tried the wrist rest yet but I\u2019ve heard good things however I\u2019m not counting this as I haven\u2019t tested it yet.Look: As I said above it looks high grade and very durable which it has been so far. The lights are bright and there\u2019s plenty of customization. Whichever mode or custom mode you go with, the LEDs are bright and look fantastic.Software/customization: I honestly like Icue a lot. Any of the software used by these major companies (razer/Corsair/hyperx) may be or seem confusing at first but if you spend some time in the program it\u2019s easy to figure out. Within the first few hours I was able to create custom profiles and save profiles to my keyboard which I can activate anytime even with icue closed (keyboard has a specific key dedicated to this). There\u2019s so many options and things you can do with the lighting it\u2019s crazy. From using any of the premade modes to making your own custom profiles to downloading other community profiles there\u2019s so many things you can do. Software was easy to navigate and figure out. If you feel overwhelmed just sit back and watch some guides, there\u2019s plenty on YouTube.Complaints:- Don\u2019t have many, only minor complaint I have is the space bar. It\u2019s louder than any of the other keys and feels a bit looser too. It doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s cheaply made at all, it\u2019s just very loud and feels a bit high compared to other keys as in there\u2019s a lot of space between the bottom of the key and the top.- One thing I\u2019m worried about for the future is the keycap injections. I haven\u2019t had any of my keys lose their font at all but im fairly certain the injections are ABS so I\u2019m waiting to see what happens. This isn\u2019t a complaint yet but we\u2019ll see later on.Overall I\u2019m extremely happy so far. Will update later down the road but definitely feels like a great purchase. It goes on sale frequently from $159 to $129 but it feels worth it at either price point. I\u2019ve heard extremely negative things about razer overall and I\u2019ve had my own bad experiences so it was either Corsair, redragon or Logitech and I\u2019m glad I went with Corsair. Redragon is still on the table if anything happens but as I said so far so good.Edit: I\u2019ve had this keyboard for over a year now. No issues, software is user friendly and took no time to get used to. It\u2019s fast and works well. No issues with the keyboard at all, keycap injections are still perfecr. Lights are still perfect. Overall amazing keyboard.",

Downgraded to this and I'm pretty happy even if I'm missing quite a few buttons and features. The keys are REALLY smooth and the only dysfunction I've had is the special keys not working, but I rarely use them anyways. They're a load quieter than my old KB and the magnetic palm rest is nice too. It's easy to yank off when I need to unlike on the K95. Would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I'm going to start by telling you that I'm not a gamer, but I prefer gaming PC hardware because it tends to be more customizable, have more options available/larger selection, and lasts a lot longer. I am a developer and work in the IT department of a large organization, spending over 50 hours per week at my computer typing code, documentation, emails, etc., so my machine is important to me.I needed a new keyboard and just wanted RGB so I went on a hunt and asked some gamer friends for recommendations on what to look for. Based on my \"likes\" for keyboard feel, they recommended the Cherry Red switches (in addition to a few others). I was able to test some at a local PC store and decided that the Cherry MX Red from Corsair was by far my favorite. Then off to Amazon for the right options/layout and price. I prefer a keyboard with a bit more angle and a deeper key. As non-gamer, I didn't need the customizable hot keys, but I absolutely insist on a separate number pad for when I'm doing calculations. that led me to this layout (non mini, non low profile, no gamer keys off to the left).This keyboard feels great. I actually find that I make fewer typos when using it than on my prior keyboard. It's amazing with the right amount of give and take in a key will do for you.I will say that the keys are a little more sensitive than I'm used to so I occasionally get a double hit on a key or if I'm resting my left hand while I type some right hand letters, a left hand key might slip in the mix. I'll get used to it over time but it is something to note. The included wrist rest is a must to get the right angle on the keys, and I wish the back prop supports were a bit longer, but I'll make it work.The RGB lighting effects are amazing, even without the proprietary software. It worked plug and play out of the box, but the description is wrong - it says you only need USB 2.0. You need at least one 3.0 port for the keyboard itself, but the passthrough USB can be 3.0 or 2.0.I love that it came with a few replacement/alternate keys for the main gaming keys (wasd and fderqw) that are textured plus a key remover. You won't need the key remover, though - I had 4 keys that had popped off in transit and I had to replace them. No damage but I had to pop them back on.The volume control wheel is more helpful than I would have thought, and it's even intelligent enough to adjust the volume on the remote machine when connected and using an RDP session but adjust the local machine settings if you minimize the RDP session and return to your local workstation.I've only used this for about half a workday so far and already I'm in love. I would absolutely buy this keyboard again and am considering getting a full set of replacement keys for when I eventually wear the paint off these (as I tend to do, no idea how!)Long story long, this is a great RGB keyboard with a smooth keystroke and just enough click to let you know it's mechanical. Corsair got this one right.",

                "reviewText": "Pretty basic mechanical keyboard but you are paying for the quality control and materials, plus of course the RGB. Feels extremely sturdy and nice and everything is well designed.The Cherry MX Red switches are nice to me. I've had blues in the past and while those were kind of interesting, they were also obnoxious to everyone in your house/Discord chat with their constant clicking. These feel nice and are reasonably quiet, especially with some cheap o-rings from Amazon thrown on the keys as well. I would highly recommend doing that for the $10. With that modification the keys still feel nice and precise but the sound from bottoming out is reduced.The iCUE software lets you do some crazy things and isn't quite as bloaty as some other driver packages. At first I ran my mouse (Corsair Glaive) and the K70 in hardware mode using their onboard memory instead of having the iCUE app running constantly, but eventually decided to just let it run since it only used like 200MB of RAM and 0.3% of my CPU (3900X).I paid $160 CAD for this and at that price I don't feel like I got ripped off. The RGB is kinda cool but I personally just set it to blue-y white to match my other peripherals. It's a nice keyboard, but whether or not it's worth double what similarly specced Chinese knockoffs are worth is a decision you'll have to make. I think it may be, since it should last a really long time and it is definitely a little nicer than Redragon or similar.",
