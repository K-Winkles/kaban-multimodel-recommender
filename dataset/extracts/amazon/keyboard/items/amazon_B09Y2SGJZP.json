Just put in the receiver and both the mouse and the keyboard were connected right away.The keys feel nice, similar to how keys feel on a good laptop keyboard. Short travel, great for fast typing.I like that the keyboard is very compact. It has all the keys, plus the number pad, standard key size, yet it's a bit more compact than normal. Great if you need to carry it with you in a backpack or briefcase.The battery is great. It has a USB charging capability, but I've been using it for a week and no signs of battery depletion. Still have not had to charge it, working on the out-of-box charge. It looks like you won't need to charge it for months.The only problem - I bought it in pink. I guess I should have ordered white or grey or black, something manly :)You can choose the color you like, I guess. Looks great.",

The size of the keyboard is nice as well - it's small and compact, but not so small that it's hard to use. the mouse is very smooth and comfortable and virtually quiet when clicking. The center scroll also clicks, awesome feature. They were both very easy to install - plug in the sensor and turn on the mouse and keyboard - couldn't have been easier. Can't speak for the battery life yet, but have read great things. Of course it comes with the cord for charging. Definitely recommend!",

Very disappointed that it does not work as they claim it is supposed to.Hello potential buyers.JoyAccess will offer a free gift of an HDMI cable to buyers for sending them a copy of the order number and a copy of the review. I don't know if they will offer a gift for an honest review. I would like the free gift so here I go:I am NOT satisfied with the price of this product compared to how it works. Purchased on 9-13-20 for $39.89. It is currently listed for $33.88. Should have sent it back and ordered a new one. Instead, I requested a replacement.It does not seem to work correctly. When you click normally the mouse will not make a left-click selection, unless you click down extra long and hard. Yes, I have tried different settings. It does not always right click either taking time from your day to find a different avenue to be able to do what the right click is supposed to.The charge on the mouse seems rather short like I got a used product... I wonder if I did the box had a sticker over the silver color and had the color Rosy over it. You could see through the cheap sticker overlay.The mouse only lasts about 10 days. It is used for about 5 hours a day seven days a week. The product stated it was expected to last at least 30 days for similar usage. The keyboard is supposed to last longer.... Idk because we can't afford for it to die on us so we will charge it every 30 instead of the 90 days recommended for our usage.We want it to do what is supposed to do and we like the color. I may try to update to see if I still got a gift for an honest review. They say they will send it 7 days after they receive my email... So If Not Updated, they did not send the free gift. They have a disclaimer \"Manufacturer's discretion\" for the gift. A gift shouldn't come with a disclaimer. But that is my opinion.Update: 10-3-20. The mouse appears to be clicking like it should we don't have to select the left click on the replacement mouse so hard. I may or may not update how it charges. Still love the color.",

I am a heavy computer user and always need to update database. the mouse is comfortable and decent size. The mouse dpi was unexpected, its very fast, precised and accurate. More important there is no delay for both units. i use a large size mouse pad and its extremely smooth. I really like the color! i would highly recommend this keyboard and mouse especially for those who have limited space.",
