                "reviewText": "UPDATE After a lot of use: Still a nice keyboard, BUT...backlighting would have made it PERFECT. Not. Being so dark, it is hard to see in low light. I have shopped keyboards now too much. Waiting for 1. backlit, 2. silver or white, 3. connects with USB C as this does, and also 4. Has ports on the back like this does - so there ya go - this one but with backlighting. I don't want wireless, and I don't want Bluetooth. Hassles with batteries and charging have gotten so old. :) Macally if you are listening...I like cords. I wanted this keyboard despite it's width because it has 3 USB ports on it and I love ports too. So the mouse is plugged into the keyboard, and the keyboard is plugged into the mini and I have two more ports, including a C port, on the keyboard. Very handy these days, when laptops are almost portless. Along with the Satechi multiport my Mini is now a go. AND this keyboard came in the same color as my Mini - the dark Space Gray. So - as far as a Mac Mini goes, this is ideal. Had it awhile now and am happy.",
