Wireless (2.4Ghz & BT) and wired. Satisfying mechanical clickies. The keyboard is gorgeous and high quality. The Super Buttons are heavy and feel pretty good (wish there was less jiggle room, though) and have a satisfying click sound when pressed.8bitdo has Ultimate software that lets you program more complex instructions for the Super Buttons. Once programmed, you can close the software, everything is saved on the keyboard itself. The software needs a lot of English localization help currently, but it's comprehensible and, most importantly, it works.",

                "reviewText": "Big fan of both retro gear and mechanical keyboards, and this one hits the spot. There will be more technical reviews than this one - if you're wondering about the hot-swapping capabilities and key response curves, this isn't your review.The execution on the Nintendo style version is just fantastic. The branding, from the housing to the volume and power knobs is on point. The matte grey keys are substantial, have a good texture., and the font work is just plain dead on. The switches themselves have a satisfying but understated \"clicky-ness\", and through the keystroke there's a Commodore 64 like \"thunk\" at the end.The auxilary \"A\" and \"B\" buttons have that same \"Office Depot Easy Button\" sound, and are easy to program to do pretty much whatever you want.The keyboard comes with a dongle, but it wasn't needed as my laptop recognized the keyboard immediately via bluetooth.If I had a complaint, it'd be that there is no numeric keypad, and no version that has one. But that's my choice...not a design flaw.Very happy with the purchase, and look forward to plunking away at this one.",

The sound is enjoyable, although the space bar is a little hollow. The box switches were an excellent choice, and all keys seem to function well. No issues thus far. I haven't tried the other modes and have been using it wired, and have had no latency issues. I have no modded the board yet, and am unsure if I will do so.While this is not the best keyboard on the market, this is a good buy and really enjoyable to use. I especially enjoy the retro look, which is why I bought it in the first place. This can be a solid choice for people who are looking to not have a TKL.",

It's the smoothest mechanical I've ever typed on. It's not too loud, but still mechanical clicky goodness. The 2.4 dongle has a magnetic click in, and hides just below. Though I'm using it with USB-C connection. Bluetooth also works great. I love it so much I had to buy the Atari looking red one too, for work. I also like the big buttons. Mapped one to open Teams, and another to open Microsoft Terminal. Works great. Easy to map too, with the one button at the top.Update: Bought the other one. Delivered super fast. Everyone at work thought it was super awesome, and laughed at the big buttons I hotkeyed. Love it.",

                "reviewText": "This is a GREAT mechnanical keyboard. I've had experience with various brands like Razer, Logitech, and Filco, but this one is definitely the one that feels the best. The switches feel sturdy and responsive while the sound is satisfying after each key press.I'm using this keyboard for work related tasks as as software developer. Makes writing code so much fun and rewarding. I work remotely so I don't know if this will be acceptable in a quiet working environment.I love the NES color scheme and the overall retro look. I appreciate the details and the overall design. Only issue I have is there's no keypad which I didn't realize how much I actually used that part of the keyboard until I didn't have it at all. Perhaps they'll make it as an accessory item that you can attach to the keyboard like the two GIANT buttons provided. I don't use the two giant buttons at all, but thought it was cool to have.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. As someone that's built a couple of custom keyboards, some in ABS cases and solid aluminum ones, I wasn't honestly expecting a whole lot coming from this relatively inexpensive package. But in the end, I was quite pleasantly surprised by how much you're getting here in terms of a quality keyboard and feature set.The keyboard looks are by far the biggest selling point. I personally dig the retro famicom look and style. The keycaps are PBT, so they have a lightly sanded texture to them, which I personally find to add to the retro feel 8bitdo was going for here. In addition, the keyboard comes with Kailh Box White switches, which I find to be the ideal balance between weight and clickiness for most folks looking to pick up something more retro inspired. These are not at all like your typical MX blue style of switch. These Box Whites use click bars for a more distinct and tactile click. The clicky switches, paired with the somewhat larger and open case design, makes the sound of the keyboard harken back to the older boards of the yesteryear.The giant buttons it comes with are also a nice touch, and I love that you can program them on the fly without any additional software. These big buttons are NOT the same switches as the rest of the keyboard, however. These are Gateron Green clicky switches, and sadly aren't nearly as clean-sounding as the box whites. The neat thing though is that these too are also hotswapable, meaning that you can change them to other switches if you'd like.I took this board just a little bit further and decided to hotswap the switches out with modded Zeal Clickiez, giving the keyboard an even more tactile and deeper click (SEE VIDEO). I was also surprised to know that the stabilizers have been factory lubed and dampened, making it that much more worth its value. The mods have made this keyboard one of my favourites and I'm currently using this one as my daily driver for the time being.",

Purtroppo al momento il sfotware supporta solo la comunicazione via USB.Inizialmente ero preoccupato per il layout, ma devo essere sincero: una volta che ci si fa l'abitudine, il layout americano \u00e8 molto comodo.

                "reviewText": "Before purchasing this keyboard, be sure you've familiarized yourself with the different switches available on the market. When coming from a rubber dome keyboard (all cheap keyboards on the market), the feeling will be different. This keyboard uses Kailh Box White switches, and coming from their Brown switches, the difference is immediately noticeable.The click can be felt and is audible, in a very pleasant manner, making it a delight to type on. The entire keyboard feels well constructed, sturdy and stable. The keys feel less spongey than my previous Sharkoon Skiller Mech SKG3, with the aforementioned brown switches. Being a heavy typer, I tend to bottom out my keys. Doing so makes the keyboard even louder, but it should be noted that the sound for bottoming out the stroke isn't unpleasantly loud, and the switches tend to prevent me from doing so in a better way than the brown switches did. Don't use in an environment where other people tend to work.The keyboard itself is in the ANSI format, without a numpad. As a Dutch person working in an international environment, this is ideal. There is no reason to worry whether you're sent the keyboard shown in the image, or a version with a local layout instead. To QWERTZ or AZERTY users, or those who would prefer another type of European layout, this may be an issue though. What you see is what you get.8Bit Do's software is to be downloaded from their website separately, which will allow users to set up macros for the large A and B button. These buttons, unfortunately, don't remotely feel like the A/B buttons of an original NES controller, but they look great.I very much like the on-keyboard switch, allowing me to toggle between a bluetooth and 2.4 gHz connection. As this effectively prevents me from having to use a KVM switch, when switching from my main PC to a laptop. The 2.4 gHz receiver can be stored securely in the keyboard itself.The only thing missing are dedicated media keys. These might be mappable via the downloadable software. A good thing about this suite is that any changes configured are stored on the keyboard's memory, allowing the softare to be uninstalled, rather than it running as a permanent background process.Also, the keyboard doesn't come with any form of transport pouch or case. Which I would have welcomed.",
