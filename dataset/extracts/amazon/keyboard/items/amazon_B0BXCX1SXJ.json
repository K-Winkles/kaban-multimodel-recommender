The battery only lasts a few days before it stops connecting automatically. The meter says the battery is at 83%, but I have to connect manually or recharge the battery. I am using Bluetooth 5. Edit: after some time for break-in the battery lasts over a week now.I use ubuntu linux in bluetooth mode. When it wakes and I start typing the system settings windows always pops up. I can work around it by using alt+ F4 to close it. Edit : this issue was solved when I did function/w. In Android mode it works fine.I would buy this product again because the price was good. But since it does not work correctly with linux I will not. Edit : I have changed the rating to five stars because the battery lasts much longer now. Apparently it needed time for break-in. With some adjustments I've discovered it works extremely well with Linux. I use Ubuntu 22.04 and I discovered that I can customize any keystroke. The only thing I find irritating is that every time it wakes up the system properties screen pops up. But I just hit Alt /f4 and it goes away.",

Also a very nice ability to use either wireless or bluetooth connection which once you turn the computer on it seemlessly connects right off the top. For the price and what you get with it, I think you will be happy with this purchase.. It is also nice it has a full number pad on the keyboard... some do not have that. I have the white but they also make a black keyboard too!",

                "reviewText": "Overall I like it. However I measured it next to my old wireless keyboard and my laptop keyboard, and the QWERTY keys on this are slightly smaller in width than the ones I was using.This was a bit of an issue at first use, but after about a week of use, I guess my brain updated, and my fingers have adjusted to the new dimensions so much that I realized I didn't notice the slight variation in width.UPDATE:I have had about a month, and with less than moderate use. I was noticing that the space bar with double space often, and I thought it was just me, but after reading other reviews, I realized it wasn't and have decided to return it. It wasn't a noticeable issue at first because my use has been less than moderate so far because of the holiday season, but now that I am getting back into the swing of productivity, it isn't something that I can live with.The battery life seems to be decent this far, and overall, it isn't a terrible keyboard, just a small quirk that makes it impractical for my needs.",

It even connect at first, but got disconnecting ALL THE TIME. So annoying! So I decided to use the USB plug (I already had a connector adapter for my screen monitor, and it also have the USB entry) and it works, I thought. But all the time when I was writing, it stop working, or put extra letters, or extra dots, or didn\u2019t put all the letters I typed, STRESSFUL! I need it for work, and I have to been revising EVER SINGLE SENTENCE I wrote. I don\u2019t recommend.I don\u2019t need a fancy keyboard, but the least I need one that works properly!After 2 weeks trying, it stop working at all. I am open a devolution today.",
