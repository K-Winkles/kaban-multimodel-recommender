                "reviewText": "Purchased end of July. Started using mid-September through now and keys don\u2019t always work. Sometimes they don\u2019t work until after repetitive tapping. Maybe I got a defective product because I just started using it and it\u2019s not great for work. I have to be mindful of what I\u2019m typing otherwise you will have a lot of typos.*UPDATE*The seller reached out to me and was very kind. I explained the issue and they replaced my item. I\u2019m so glad because this is a cute and quiet keyboard to use at work. I cannot stand the clacking of keys constantly and this keeps it quieter than most other keyboards.",

But I clicked it back together and works like it was never dropped. The keyboard is really nice too, but I didn\u2019t drop that. The color reminds me of a deep wine color, which I love. No complaints. It does what it\u2019s intended for.",

                "reviewText": "First impression is that it is very pretty! I love the splash of color in my cubicle. It perfectly matches an organizer I got here https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QG8YFZ9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Both pieces feels sturdy enough for daily use & keyboard sits properly on my desk without wobbling.The keyboard: all keys seem to be correct & work properly. I type most of the day at 75wpm & this keyboard is easy to use. I like it much better than a laptop keyboard & maybe better than the standard dell keyboard I've been using. Only trouble I'm having is that the backspace key is a little too short for my short fingers to reach, but I think I'm already adapting. And I'm not used to having the backspace key on the number keypad, so I must adjust to that as well. The keys are textured & are already becoming very, very slightly discolored. I will have to clean them frequently.The mouse works great and does not enter power saving mode too quickly, it takes several minutes of idle time to shut off. When it does, I can easily click once to wake it up without any trouble. It's a nice size for my small hands & has a very quite, almost silent click.After just 2 days of use, I'm happy with this set. I will update if that is no longer the case.",

                "reviewText": "I should've heeded the advice from many other reviewers. This product at first glance it looks very nice and for what it's worth the one star could be given for its appearance. Unfortunately this is where the pros stop. Everything about the functionality of this is horrible. Sitting about 12-16 inches from the dongle so results in substantial drops and often I find myself typing with no input. The mouse frequently skips around the screen or freezes all together. Both the left and right mouse buttons are monster mash. Just the mushy things you could ever imagine. No physical feedback, hardly an audible noise, I seem to find myself clicking with just the inner pieces near the wheel for any type of feedback from the mouse.The plastic is glossy and print to excessive fingerprint smudging but I guess that's to be expected and it's not a knock on the functionality just dated aesthetics. Both devices are run from one dongle which may be causing some of the issues. On that note make sure you don't lose it otherwise you'll need to replace the whole set up.Overall this is just a junk product but you also get what you pay for. I'd send it back but I was tricked into a place of false security and the away the box before this thing started acting up so I'm stuck with it. Do yourself a favor and spend a few extra dollars and buy a well known brand you'll be thankful.",
