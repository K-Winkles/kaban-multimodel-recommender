This is why I impulse bought it in the first place sicne I already had a mouse from Corsair (the Sabre RGB Pro Wireless).* Doesn't require batteries (comes with charging cable).* Is wireless, so you can save some cable management (another reason I bought it, my previous wired keyboard was driving me crazy).* It has a nice design and is extremely customizable with the iCue application from Corsair.* Has a very comfortable numeric keypad.* I am not a hardcore gamer, but on the games I play I notice very little to no delay when playing wirelessly.* It is very quiet and light. It has enough sound and weight to make you feel like you are pressing something. Is not too loud that you can't use it after midnight in fear of waking up your neighbors; and not too heavy you have to destroy the key to press it.* Has a set of 6 customizable keys. Haven't used them yet, but will soon.What I don't like:* It is not USB-C but USB mini-B! This is my main regret as an impulse buy, so not really their fault, I should have read more carefully. My mouse is USB-C, so I cannot really use their charging cables interchangeably. Oh well.* Another issue is that the keyboard doesn't work when turned off and connected by wire (charging). I know that sounds weird, but the mouse I have does work when turned off if it is connected by wire (charging).* Is a bit too big (is bigger than my laptop, which looks really silly), and somehow the keys feel weirdly small. I assume is just me trying to adapt to the new size and key design (they are kinda tall instead of flat, like the ones I am familiar with).* For some reason, the video buttons work abnormally (sometimes they do, sometimes they don't, the backward and forward button usually don't work on youtube, the play/pause and stop button do work).The arm rest is kind of unnecessary, although it does make it look nicer and less squarish (though it does make it bigger).All in all, it served the main function I wanted it for: reduce USB connections and cable space management. But I do have some regrets about some of the features.",

                "reviewText": "I haven't used my setup for gaming yet, so this review is basically ergonomics, aesthetics, and setup only. On the first two fronts, it is a great setup. It looks sharp, it feels comfortable after hours of typing/scrolling for school and work, and is small enough to sit comfortably on a height-adjustable stand for when I want to stand and work.As far as setup, the Corsair iCue software is a bit buggy, so I'm not sure if this is a keyboard issue or a software issue. The keyboard firmware won't update - it gives me an \"update failed\" error every time I try. Everything seems to work fine, except the keyboard is the only RGB item (and ALL of my RGB devices are Corsair only, so I could avoid this exact issue) that won't sync with the rest of the lights. No matter what I try, the keyboard defaults to its own RGB profile...which is never the same thing, so I haven't even been able to figure out if it's some kind of default setting that I'm managing to miss. Sometimes it's just a solid color, sometimes it's one of the \"mural\" options....no way to predict what it'll be. But one thing is for sure - it will NOT be the option I tell it to be lol.For reference: I have this mouse/keyboard setup, a Corsair gaming mat, the headphone stand, AIO CPU cooler, case, RAM, and some LED strips under/behind my desk. Literally everything except the keyboard will display the RGB profile I set it to. Oh well - it's annoying, but not enough to knock a star off.",

The LEDs are bright and the effects are awesome. The battery life is more than enough for your all night, monster energy gaming sessions, with your bros.",

                "reviewText": "I researched the hell out of this keyboard before finally buying it. For the price point and features, there is bluntly no competition.What sold me:\u2022 QUIET keyboard with good typing experience\u2022 Cool-looking RGB with lots of effects!\u2022 A wireless keyboard I could swap between my computer, tablet, and phone without needing multiple keyboards (has 3 wireless modes: dongle + 2 different bluetooth devices, you toggle with FN key, PLUS direct USB)\u2022 Volume and media controls\u2022 EXCELLENT RANGE (I stream my desktop to other screens in the house. Never had a problem connecting)\u2022 Low latency for when I'm gamingThings to be aware of:\u2022 Hybrid mechanical/membrane - It's a little squishier/has more resistance than a pure mechanical keyboard, but the typing experience is still good and far, FAR better than your average membrane keyboard.\u2022 Did I mention it's QUIET? (if you're a clacky-key fan, this one is NOT for you)\u2022 Poly-carbonate body - It flexes a little, but it doesn't feel flimsy\u2022 Per-Key lighting requires wired/USB mode (but works really REALLY good). Side note: the iCue software actually works very well with the K57. I was skeptical after my experience with other Corsair peripherals, but in this case I've had zero issues with iCue.\u2022 RGB in wireless is still robust and has a lot of different options easily changed through the FN key, and looks great.\u2022 I can easily get 2-3 days on a charge, moderate usage all day long, RGB turned on.Simply... this keyboard is GORGEOUS! Not only that, it's highly functional, and won't break the bank like other wireless RGB options. As long as you're not a clicky-key purist, this keyboard should serve you well!",

Alle Tasten, die man braucht, sind vorhanden und lassen sich leicht bedienen. Das Beste daran ist, dass sie sowohl kabellos als auch kabelgebunden verwendet werden kann.",
