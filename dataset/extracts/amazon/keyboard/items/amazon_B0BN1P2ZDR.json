Yes, this keyboard supports both Windows and MacOS operating systems across all channels (2.4G/wired/Bluetooth). You can switch between the WIN system by pressing the FN+O key combination, and the MAC system by pressing the FN+P key combination. Is the backlight uneven? Different backlight modes can cause varying brightness and light shapes which may create the impression of unevenness. This is normal. To achieve an even backlight, you can adjust the mode to steady light (default), breathing mode, etc. Does it need frequent charging? When the backlight is fully turned on, it will increase power consumption, and the keyboard can be used for about a week. With the backlight turned off, it can last up to 30 days. Bluetooth connection unstable? Occasionally, the keyboard may experience unstable Bluetooth connections. Simply delete the current pairing and re-pair the devices to resolve the issue. Do I need to install drivers or an app? How do I download the driver? Why can't I use the driver in Bluetooth mode? 1. For common tasks like typing and office work, no drivers or apps are needed. 2. To customize or remap keys to your preferences, visit our official website for the corresponding product driver. Note: drivers can only be configured in wired mode.",

                "reviewText": "Gone through a lot of keyboards here in last few years. I'm not a gamer, but work from home full time and do a lot of typing as well as number entry. Once I tried mechanical keyboards I really liked them but found the noise, even with the quieter red switches with an extra o-ring were just too loud: any typing was clearly audible on conference calls and working at night would often wake my kids up who sleep in the next room. So I gave up and went back to a membrane keyboard (a high end one). But after a year of using that I was just never quite happy and after looking around a bit I ran across this and figured I would give it a go. Am very glad I did. I get the better typing experience of a mechancal keyboard but whatever they have done with the switches here they're definitely quieter than any other mechanical keyboard with the quietest switches available. These still make noise for sure and are louder than a membrane keyboard, but the noise is just enough to where its not disruptive. Very satisfying click and key travel is just right. I also find the orange F1-F4 keys are a nice feature: I'm in excel a lot so F2 and F4 are common use for me and while it took a little adjustment for the different spacing on this keyboard, it was quick and the keys are nice and visible even in peripheral vision so my eyes don't need to leave the screen. Battery life has been good so far for such a light (not a big battery) keyboard. I've been using daily for 2 weeks now using bluetooth connection and backlight on and have lost about 15% of charge. Backlighting is nice and keeps keys visible in low light without being distracting or harsh on the eyes. I would absolutely recommend this if you're looking for a solidly built, great typing experience, reasonably quiet, good battery life wireless mechanical keyboard. Checked all the boxes for me so I'll be keeping this one for quite a while.",

                "reviewText": "I got the keyboard as I wanted something full size in addtion to Keychron TKL C1 I got for one of my systems. So comparing the two is not ideal, but bottom line is the C1 was just a nicer type board. The qaulity of Keychron felt just better. I got the Gateron Brown switches in C1 but this ProtoArc being somewhat low profile just did not work for me. The clicking and responsivness of the keys was not satisfying and the overall typing experience was ok, but not much or any better than my regular membrane one I have used for many years. It is pretty quiet but the angle of the board did not work for me, even with the adjustble legs. The features of this keyborard were pretty nice, the backlighting while not RGB was quite good, the options for BT and Wireless connectivity was also good but not useful for me as I attach thru cable. Returning to quality issue, ther board came a bit bent so I had to stretch it a bit to make it even sit flat on the desk, that was a sign of something being off here. I loved the knob on the board for volume control which worked very well. I think it's an ok board, but probably too expensive for what it is. I replaced it with another at same price point which is much better, but TKL and not full size, I suppose I'm getting used to slightly smaller units.",

With backlight 90% of the keys are partially lit, making it difficult to read.3. For half of the price, other products give better visibility of keys when backlight is on/offPros:1. Key board looks good2. Typing seems to be smooth and not loud for office work.3. Volume nob is a nice addition.",

The media controls are very intuitive and the volume control knob has a very nice clicky feel to it. The fact that the keyboard can be used via wire, dongle, OR bluetooth and you can switch between any of those modes with the press of a button is amazing.All the different lighting modes are cool, but I find most of them distracting so I don't use them.Anyway, this keyboard is AMAZING. DEFINITELY worth the buy. Wow.",
