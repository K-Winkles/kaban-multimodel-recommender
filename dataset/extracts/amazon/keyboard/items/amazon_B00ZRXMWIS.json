                "reviewText": "Been using a Lenovo wireless keyboard for a while now at work. Although the size of the Lenovo keyboard was excellent for me (I hate compact keyboards!), the buttons and overall feel and layout of the keyboard were not comfortable at all. I work on MS Word many hours a day and felt the need to look for something more comfortable.This Logitech keyboard is a definite improvement! Build quality is excellent and you can feel it is not a cheap keyboard. The buttons are comfortable and spaced logically to feel so you won't hit two buttons at the same time. And although the size is just slightly smaller than the Lenovo keyboard it is a good size and didn't feel smaller. The solar power feature is also fantastic as this doesn't need recharging or batteries.My only menial complaints are that the standoffs on the back of the keyboard could have been a little longer as the keyboard is very thin and even with the standoffs it feels only slightly tilted, The other complaint is that the face of the keyboard has a glossy finish which, while it gives it an elegant look, can be a fingerprint magnet. However those complaints do not take from the overall experience of this keyboard which I will definitely get another one for my PC at home.",

Already reached out to the seller and keep you posted how that works. Wish I would have purchased a new one.My take: Do NOT buy refurbished - the refurbishment or testing process is not good enough.UPDATE: Seller responded quickly and offered a return. Won't work for me as the exchange policy only applies for the US. In my case I bought the \"certified refurbished\" keyboard while on a business trip in the US. Well - lessons learned - don't by refurbished - their quality control is not up-to-par",

The keyboard stays at usable charge level at all times, even though it is not in a very well lighted area. When not in use, I slide the keyboard drawer into its place under the top of my desk, but the keyboard still works perfectly. The only issue I have with this refurbished keyboard is that a part of the clear plastic cover over the solar cells is slightly detached from the surface (see photos). This hasn't caused a problem, but the opening may allow dust to accumulate over time, which I assume would degrade the capacity of those cells. I will fix it with a spot of glue, but in a carefully refurbished device, I did not expect this obvious an imperfection. Other than that one loose bit, the board looks like new with absolutely no signs of wear. Would not hesitate to buy another one.",

                "reviewText": "This keyboard is great with the primary draw-back that there is no charging option other than Solar, and if you don't use it in a well lit room, the battery will fade and become unmanageable. Buying two keyboards let's you recharge one while using the other, as well as providing a cheap source of backup keys! The action on the keyboard is nice, and as someone who types well over 100wpm, programs and games, I feel I can confidently claim almost all users will be happy with the low profile, well spaced, springy and responsive keys. Even after years of use, most keys remain springy with only a few getting 'soft'.. usually due to food or other matter stuck behind the keys. The 'F' and 'J' keys have an identification bump making typing or even gaming in the dark reasonable even though the keys have no lighting. A nice range of functions compatible with both Mac and PC, I have used both systems while owning no other keyboards, and been pleased for the most part. In a moderately well lit room, the keyboard battery should last around 2 years in my experience. There is no USB port on this keyboard, and the battery tray is designed to be very difficult to open (there's no tool that makes it easier), and will break if repeatedly opened. Once broken, the battery tray still stays in place sufficiently, and becomes much easier to remove/replace... I have intentionally broken or clipped all of my trays so that I can swap them out. A single key for this keyboard can cost over $20-$40 or more, and coupled with the absence of an alternative to solar charging, makes buying a second keyboard seem to be the smart choice if you either lose your charge, or to replace a key. (I lost my left 'ctrl' key, and the solution was to buy a new keyboard :-( The Logitech Unifying receiver is an inferior piece of technology which, for some reason, Logitech cripples all of their wireless devices with. These wireless receivers are prone to interference if the USB receiver is placed next to any other connected USB device. More than two devices will often interfere with each other, and the entire system works on a line of site premise meaning if your leg is between the keyboard and the receiver, your keyboard may well become unresponsive. (I have experienced this with my receiver less than 3 feet from the keyboard) When the connection is lost, the keyboard will buffer your keystrokes, then once the connection is re-established, it will send all buffered keystrokes as well as whatever you're pressing at the time. It's fairly impossible to tell, however, when it will buffer keystrokes vs. when they simply aren't being received, so when your connection is interrupted, you will rarely know whether you just need to move the keyboard and wait for the keystrokes to register vs. when you need to keep hitting keys to get your system to respond to you. Despite having to plug in a custom USB receiver, logitech universal devices do not connect to your computer until you have completed the software setup. This means that if your driver is lost, corrupted, or your computer does not load the driver, this keyboard will not work. If you don't have a backup (non-logitech wireless) keyboard, you very likely will be unable to get in to the logitech unifying software to re-initialize your keyboard. Because I had all wireless products, I have encountered situations where I could no longer use my computer until I jogged out to get a backup keyboard that works when plugged in.",
