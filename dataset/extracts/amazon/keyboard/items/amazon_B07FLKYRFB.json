I think I got it for, like, 30 bucks. I use it on a mini-pc and my nvidia shield and my laptop when I dont want to use its keyboard. does the job.cons- lights. you can turn these off by clicking fn and the pause break button. its in the manual that comes with it as well but I know its not the easiest to find out initially.- feel. it feels cheap. I know I just said its okay, but it does feel like it'll break under you when its got those little plastic feet out. keep it flat, that'll make it feel more sturdy.would I use this as a gaming keyboard? no. theres so many other keyboards out there that're not only cheaper but have better response. im not saying this keyboard doesnt have a latency, but you can do better. I have a wired klim that I use for my second computer, but its an older klim made out of metal and def has more quality put into it. this has some of that klim quality, but not as well as some of their other products. but hey, cheap & works & comes fast? I cant complain too much. great little back up/tester. wouldn't use this on the daily.oh, this thing also catches dust and dirt like no ones buisness. wash your hands before you use it.",

                "reviewText": "Testing out the keyboard to see how responsive it is. It's not bad at all. Feels a little cheap when typing, but not bad. Keys are a little soft on impact but not bad. It's very quiet except for the spacebar, which is super loud. I don't see any lag at all with it. The instructions it comes with are so sparse as to be almost totally useless, but it's very plug-and-play, so that's really fine. I'm still not sure how to change the RGB settings on it, though. I also was very pleasantly surprised to find that it's USB-C rechargeable. So far, I've only been using it for a few minutes, so I can't say for sure, but I really like it. For the crazy low price, I'm very pleased.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I like the size and color of this keyboard. It does come with a few flaws. I am used to my other keyboard being plugged in, so the keys stay backlit until I turn them off. This one turns off after about 30 seconds, which is not great for me, since I work in a dimly lot or dark room most of the time. It does save battery, though. I haven't had to recharged it since I got it, so about a month. Granted, I haven't used it all that often so far. There is some control over the brightness of lights and fade, but it doesn't have that much versatility, especially for someone who like customizing things.I found that the Shift key on the left does not work with Ctrl. If you want to use \"Shift +Ctrl\" you have to use the left Shift key. It is quite inconvenient. I also keep missing the Enter key because I'm used to it being a bit bigger, but that's probably a me problem. They keys are smooth and way more silent than I am used to, which is great.",

                "reviewText": "When I turned it on and the back lights appeared in a beautiful rainbow pattern, I was blown away. It is such a nice keyboard. I am definitely impressed with this product upon first receipt.What I love best about the product is everything, really. The keys are soft and comfortable. With the exception of the space key, I love how quiet these keys are. I can type discreetly without being too loud. I love that the lighting is adjustable (both in pattern and brightness). The \"breathing\" mode is a very neat feature and I like that I can adjust the speed of it. It has a calming effect! But I also like that I can keep the lights on all the time or even turn them off completely if I don't want them on. The wireless feature is neat because I can take it anywhere and position it anywhere and don't have to worry about plugging it in. I like the little legs on the bottom so I can raise the keyboard up or leave it flat if I want it to be more (or less) ergonomic. The battery display is a great feature because I can tell when I need to plug it in before it loses power. I also like that the dongle that plugs into the computer has a little nook on the back of the keyboard so they can stay together when not in use.On the instructions pamphlet, at the very end, it says \"Thinks for Reading.\" It should say \"Thanks for Reading.\" It's obvious that great care was taken to create a high-quality product, so it's disappointing to see such a careless error.One other thing I don't care for is how loud the space bar is. All the rest of the keys are soft and hardly make a sound, but when I tap the space bar, it makes a loud plastic-y sound that seems to resonate throughout the room. For how often it gets used, I was hoping it would be a bit quieter. Other than those two things, I wouldn't change anything!This product is very easy to use. The instructions were incredibly helpful and well written. It's nice to see the instructions written out in so many languages. It gives the impression that this is a worldwide company and because of that, very successful. It gives the company a lot of credibility. The instructions were easy to read and follow. I like that the \"function\" keys are explained and there is even an illustration of the keyboard with keys labelled so they are easy to find on the real keyboard.I absolutely love this keyboard and I would recommend it to all of my friends. Whether you have a laptop or a desktop computer, this keyboard is not only great to look at, it works very well. There is an incredible value for the money here. I have several KLIM products in my office and I love each one. I am satisfied with this company and will definitely purchase products from them again.",

                "reviewText": "I originally ordered this keyboard just over 2 years ago and was (and still am) very happy with the product. The product is lightweight, the keys feel nice and they are pretty quiet. I like that it has the separate number pad but the whole keyboard is not too large or bulky. The (rechargeable) battery lasted longer than I expected so I was able to take advantage of the wireless feature. When the battery does die, you can still use the keyboard while it is plugged in and charging, and the battery light on the top right corner turns off when its charged. The rainbow colour lights behind the keys are a nice touch, too! I am not a gamer though, so I have no comment on its features for that purpose.Just recently the battery started to die more frequently and I had to plug it in more often, which was not the end of the world for me, as most keyboards require cords anyway. However, the battery eventually started to expand and the keyboard warped and became unusable. I went back to my Amazon order and checked to see if there was a warranty - and there was, 5 years! I reached out to customer service via email with pictures of the keyboard and my original invoice. They responded within the same day and offered me a replacement!I have the replacement now and I still love it. The company has provided exceptional customer service - they were very responsive and they stand behind their product. They even checked in with me to make sure that I received the replacement and that it was working as expected.",
