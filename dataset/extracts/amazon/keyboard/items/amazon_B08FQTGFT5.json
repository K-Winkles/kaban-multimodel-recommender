                "reviewText": "I am typing this review on the keyboard in the dark and the dancing RGB is so darn beauitful. The keys are quick and clicky with just the right amount of actuation force and tactical feedback. The software is a turn off for some, but I've been using it for years with very few issues. Very solid build feels like you could cut wood with it. I love Razer as a company and this is one of the top shelf keyboards IMO.",

                "reviewText": "This is my 3rd Razer mechanical keyboard. I had the original black widow and also have the v3 clicky at home. I bought this one for work since clicky keys would be too loud.The first thing I noticed with the yellow switches was just how sensitive they are to pressure. The clicky keys take some force to push down and that is a good and bad thing depending on your preference. My major problem was I tend to rest my fingers on the keys at work. This would cause random keys to be pressed. The solution is to just not rest your fingers. It took some getting used to but about a week in I saw less accidentally key activation. I think the yellow keys make you type faster but I still like my green keyboard since I know when the key is pressed.Adding to this point, I think razer should make a \"brown\" tactile but silent version of the black widow. I think the only one they offer is the compact version without the number and rest pads. I don't understand why they can't add that option to the full keyboard since they obviously designed and have the key in stock.If you are wondering how loud the keys are, that depends on how hard you hit the keys. I tend to push all the way down so even the yellow silent keys make some noise. But since they are linear, you can press halfway and they key will still activate.The razer mechanical keyboards are definitely the best imo. I've looked around but razer seems to be the only one that has the custom built wrist pad. I also like the scroll wheel and the build quality. A lot of the other mechanical keyboards have name brand cherry MX switches but then cheap out on the outer material or add weird stuff like a USB passthrough???",

                "reviewText": "I finally treated myself to a Razer keyboard after using my son's over the years. I bought this strictly for use in the office and it has made my days doing payroll so much more fun! Aside from being eye-catching, the mechanical keys are great for knowing that yes, I did enter a digit without constantly looking at my screen. And let's face it, typing 75wpm sounds frickin awesome on this keyboard!! The included wrist support works as well as anything I've used and provides a well-angled rest for 8+ hour days.Pros: Eye-catching color changing, easy to set up, comfortable to use for long periods of time.Cons: It's loud. Your every keystroke will be heard across the room. Half of my coworkers have mechanical keyboards and it's not a silent office, so I knew it wouldn't be a big deal there, but at my previous employer people would have lost their minds.Who I am: 41F, business professional, geek.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, I love typing and playing games on this keyboard, it gets the job done! If you\u2019re a casual gamer this will be good enough and is satisfying to type and do homework with. Only thing you will notice is the back space feels cheap and is by far the loudest key for some weird reason.For enthusiasts, the space bar isn\u2019t the greatest, it\u2019s just average. A little rattle, but had a nice, firm press that you can actually feel when actuate. Bunny hopping in FPS games is no problem. With the RGB, it\u2019s fairly weak, and you expect more for paying for something over $100. The razor software is on the lower tier of RGB software and is he brightness is dim compared to even $50 keyboards. Not a big issue for me, so I won\u2019t knock it too much. The silent keys aren\u2019t silent, but they give off enough sound to feel satisfying and the feedback is OUTSTANDING! When you press a key, you can feel the switch, it\u2019s hard to explain but it gives enough feedback so you know when the key is pressed it feels \u201cheavy\u201d then light again after actuation. After little time it becomes subconscious feedback that you don\u2019t realize you\u2019re using, it\u2019s great, by far the best keyboard I had for gaming and schoolwork. I\u2019m a coder so it\u2019s nice having the not so noises keys and satisfying feel. It\u2019s really hard to explain in a description, but if you\u2019re worried on how the yellow switches feel, don\u2019t be. Other than that everything else is solid, nothing fantastic. Keyboard has some bend, volume controls wheel is nice (kind of don\u2019t like the location tho would still prefer the function key) and the software is good enough for shortcuts. I also like how you can disable the windows key while gaming, little nice feature. Arm rest is okay, I have an L shaped desk so the middle kinda floats and I still don\u2019t have slipping issues like others were saying. It doesn\u2019t help that much, it\u2019s just nicer to feel than the desk and having your wrists elevated is more important imo. Overall very solid, would give 5 stars if it went above and beyond. However, the keys are above and beyond and that\u2019s what matters most",
