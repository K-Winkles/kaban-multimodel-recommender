While it doesn't have the best mechanical fell to it like some higher end mechanical keyboards, I would still describe the typing experience as above average. It has that mechanical keyboard sound and feel, but not annoying loud. The LED backlight is the perfect amount of light and makes locating keys easy in the dark. However, the color is not changeable, red only, not a deal breaker.By far my favorite feature and what sold me on this particular mechanical keyboard was the built-in USB port on the back. We plugged in a USB fingerprint reader, so logging in and auto-filling passwords with our password manager is as easy as touching the back of the keyboard. It's a feature not commonly found on keyboards and we really appreciate it here.",

Outside of some old IBM mechanical PS2 M stuff that I ended up with years ago.I bought this keyboard for my Linux video workstation. I wanted something that decently matched up with my gaming systems Razor keyboard. This does a good job there. I also wanted quieter keys that that keyboard has so I can use it while my wife and kids are asleep. This keyboard does great there. The switches are aren't too loud for mechanical switches. They have kind of a camming sort of feeling as you come to the bottom. It is softer than Red switches. The key caps are pretty stable. The LED backlighting is great, but is only red...if that maters to you. The whole keyboard is solid. It has that heavy feeling of quality. I bought this as a keyboard to do work on, but it would do wonderfully as a gaming keyboard.The unit I bought was a \"Renewed\", it arrived clean and perfect. Seriously the best priced budget gaming keyboard one could ask for if someone was looking for one. I saw the bad reviews. No telling what is going on there, but I luckily didn't have issues.",

                "reviewText": "This is an excellent keyboard and a super value for the refurb price. The key lights are handy for working in a dimly lit room, the key action is excellent. It feels solid but not quite heavy so it doesn't move around when typing. Pads on the base have good grip. It can tilt or lay flat.My only complaint, is that I thought the key board and the spare port on the back of the keyboard connected with a single cable to a computer port. In fact there are two cables with 2 separate usb connectors in a single sheath. One for the keyboard itself and the other for the spare port on the back of the keyboard. The spare is nice to have, and perhaps gamers need the infinitesimal edge having them separate, but I was short a usb port on my computer and needed what I thought was a 2nd supplemental port. I initially planned to return the keyboard, but I like it so much, and the cost of purchasing a 4 port USB hub was sufficiently modest that I kept it. Any comparable keyboard would cost much more than the refurb price including the 4 port usb hub cost.",

Bought a really nice Dell 3431 -- loaded -- to replace a dead laptop with a backlit keyboard. Stock 3431 keyboard requires normal lighting or touch typing as it isn't backlit. I'm a night owl so nay nay. And so became my quest. Red is the optimal illumination at night -- doesn't stress the eyes. Hard to find an aftermarket one that did what my laptop did. Tried a true \"gaming\" keyboard that came with large font keys and bleeds light out the bottom of the keys. Darn, that's annoying if you are a keyboard looker vs. a touch typist.Point blank. If a gamer, I'm certain there are better fruits and colored mechanical switches for you -- cherry brown, etc. If you're looking for a backlit desktop replacement, I give this a 1000% recommendation. Font is good; backlight is great. Only two downsides: 1) the built in USB \"repeater\" (you don't need to plug that cable which is marked as such if you don't want to) is v2 vs v3 AND 2) there is no NumLocks light. You get a CapLocks and a GameMode (don't know what that one does)Enjoy -- again if looking for a backlit \"office\" keyboard, this is it.",

                "reviewText": "I've bought two of these keyboards, and while they do the job for a while, it doesn't take long before issues start cropping up. The biggest and most notable is the build quality of the keycaps; in both keyboards I've had, frequently-used keys (W, E and the left Ctrl on this current one) break off, and do so in such a way that even buying replacement keys isn't workable; the tabs that hold the keys in place seem to be very cheap plastic, so they break off and stay inside the slots, making replacing the caps next to impossible.It's cheap by mechanical keyboard standards, but be wary that you get what you pay for.",

Now for the product: this thing is heavy, sturdy, and responsive. I still find it easy to type faster than my brain works, so typos are constant, but I will get used to it. The major downfall, for some, not me, is that the Romer-G keycaps are all but impossible to find good replacements for since the format never really took off. Overall, the seller is fantastic and I cannot believe how much I love the keyboard!",

I find it helps me type more quickly and accurately. I also like it for gaming. The keys can be individually replaced. This keyboard came with a \"key removing device,\" and some spare keys.The red light highlighting the letters, numbers, and symbols on the keys is bright and adjustable.A nice feature is a USB port on the side of the keyboard close to the power cord where a dongle for a wireless mouse can be placed.The unit is sturdy with two raisers on the bottom so that you can adjust how flat or tilted you want your keyboard to lie.It's weight and rubberized bottom pads stop it sliding around when it's being used.",
