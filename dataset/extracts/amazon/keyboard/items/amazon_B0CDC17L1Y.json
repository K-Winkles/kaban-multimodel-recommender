                "reviewText": "Purchased on 9/28/23 while traveling for work. This version, the V-K66 was originally listed with the K66s like it was another less RGB in your face option. It was less than half the price of the acrylic K66s but I didn\u2019t have much time to much about. Purchased and received quickly - which was great!This board however is not hotswap which was a bit disappointing as someone who likes to tinker but I purchased the linear reds and they are not offensive sounding the in the plastic case. RGB is definitely more offensive than any sound the board makes.You cannot turn off the RGB. I am all for a nice pastel slow rain drop or maybe a low steady light of one color. This board has neither other those things. I made the second mistake of purchasing PBT XDA pudding Keycaps because they were uniform and had the same quick shipping option. They sound pretty good on the board but holy RGB. Now that is mostly on me getting pudding Keycaps and the light is tamer with the included oem-ish Keycaps but my review photo is the pudding on steady light (only rainbow option is allowed) with the light turned alllll the way down so you to can to laugh at my horrification at the RGB monster I had accidentally bought and built.It uses the xvx wormier branded software/driver that must remain open at all times for any keep mapping/macros to work. This should be more apparent in the directions with the board or somewhere in the software. I am learning the hotkeys on the board as I do not want to keep the software/driver open.",
