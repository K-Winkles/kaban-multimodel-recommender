I love the fact that the keyboard and mouse share one adapter for the USB port freeing up extra usb ports. The mouse is really silent when pressing down on the left and right keys, the extra function keys on the mouse are great. Having the feature to turn off the key and the mouse is perfect for conserving battery life. I didn't like that it says Purple and it's not, however I could see that from the picture, I love love love Purple it's my favorite color and even though I knew it wasn't going to be that deep Purple that I like absolutely love, I got anyway because it has so many other awesome features that I was willing to overlook that small detail. It still falls in the Purple family. I arrived early, intact and packaged exceptionally well.",

                "reviewText": "The first day the keyboard and mouse worked fine. There were some issues with how far I could be from the computer with the keyboard and mouse but as long as I was about 2-3 feet it was fine. Then like 2 days later it just stops working at all. The keyboard says it needs new batteries so I replace both the mouse and keyboard batteries and they still don\u2019t work. I tried to go through the refund/replacement process but it says I need the original packaging/box and I don\u2019t have that because as I said the items worked fine for the first few days so I didn\u2019t keep the box. Was really excited for the option to have a place for my phone, guess I\u2019ll have to find another brand.UPDATE: they have great customer service. They were able to replace the keyboard in a few days and this one is so far great no issues at all. Thanks so much made 1 star to 5 star for great service.",

The keyboard is good as well, it functions ok. The keys are a flat-ish, just in case you don't like that. I'm not a fan but it doesn't really bother me. What did bother me was the back stands. They are really short, almost non-existent. It does not give much of a rise, so I had to purchase a riser for it.",

It's just as described on the website - ergonomic, quiet, and compatible with my del laptop. One of the standout features has been the battery life. I've been using it regularly and yet, I haven't had to change the batteries. It instantly connects with my devices, and there's never any lag. Plus, the added bonus of a phone tablet holder makes multitasking so much easier.",

                "reviewText": "The Keyboard: the keyboard is nice. it is very sleek and has function keys that can be set up. I use this with my laptop connected to a desktop to make a computer substitute. The keys make clicking sounds which you with either love or hate. I personally enjoy the feeling of clicking while typing. Just be aware when plugging into a laptop the shortcuts and function keys may not work.The mouse: Fits very well to the hand and glides across surfaces with no resistance. On the side of the mouse there are buttons that are shortcuts for \"page forward\" and \"page back\". The mouse scrolling is inverted and there does not seem to be a way to change this. Also the mouse has a small storage area in near the battery for storing the blue tooth connector.Bluetooth connection: The keyboard and mouse both share a connection through a USB Bluetooth adaptor. The connection was strong from the start and there is no delay between input and the actions being completed.Happy with this purchase!",

                "reviewText": "THIS IS A REVIEW FOR THE KEYBOARD ONLY! The mouse is probably great, but I already have my perfect mouse. Purchased multiple keyboards (WisFox, Marvo, Microsoft BT) in search of the one that fits my workplace lifestyle and not spending over $40 just for a workplace keyboard.Main things I looked for was the typing experience, how quiet, and shortcut buttons for lock screen & calculator.Everything else was a bonus such as looks and phone holder.I did not care that the keyboards used batteries (not rechargeable), used a dongle, or did not have backlit keys.TYPING EXPERIENCE: Feels cheap compared to WisFox and Microsoft BT, but sturdy. If you like mechanical keyboards but do not want an actual mechanical keyboard, then this keyboard might be the one for you.SOUND: Loud and clicky like a mechanical keyboard. Exact opposite of what I am looking for. But it is quieter than most mechanical keyboards.CALCULATOR SHORTCUT BUTTON: AvailableLOCK SCREEN SHORTCUT BUTTON: NOT AVAILABLE! Yes I know... I can just hit Windows + LAPPEARANCE: Keys are square and raised. Looks very plain and cheap compared to WisFox and Microsoft BT.PHONE HOLDER: I have a big phone case and it actually did fit my phone.DONGLE/BT: ONLY USB RECEIVEROverall, the Marvo is a good keyboard and could be used in a workplace office setting. Personally not for me because wanting quieter keys and there is not a lock screen shortcut button.",
