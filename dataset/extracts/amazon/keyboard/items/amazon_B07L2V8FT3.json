                "reviewText": "The Enter Key is larger - its not the typical size of the <shift> key as in most keyboards.The F and J keys have a easily felt raised plastic dashes on them unlike most other keyboards that seem to have a barely noticeable tiny dot on these keys so one can feel the correct positioning of the hands.The Keyboard is very slightly U shaped meaning the keys in the center of the keyboard are a tiny bit lower than the top and bottom keys this seems to help with something - I'm thinking this is a unique feature but may currently be the norm in all keyboards.The Cord in my opinion should be longer - it is 4 feet 4 inches in length as my full size case sits a tad to the right of me its somewhat of a tight fit. However, most any cord nowadays on any appliance is to short compared to what they used to be.Overall - The lighting has 3 settings this is nice as it affords the user options - there is no rainbow effect common with many other lighted keyboards to where there are multi colors to distract the eyes its simply one color at a time - The keyboard can also be turned completely off.The LED key to press as mentioned in the one page manual is located next to the right <CNTRL> key this location of it is NOT mentioned in the manual - there is a \"light\" icon on the key.The manual reads \"Do not allow the product to come into contact with water or any other liquid. This may result in fire or electrical shock.\" So the manual says this even though it shows a picture of it drenched in water.When gaming the screen usually is dark so the keys show up fine - when using something such as Microsoft Word and the screen is basically bright white because your typing on a white page the function keys seem to be quite dim.I can enjoy gaming now by only having on my 25 watt bulb that bounces light off the ceiling which gives me zero glare and then I can now easily see the keys due to the lighted keyboard whereas in the past it was often difficult.The brightness level is changed simply by pressing the FN key and then the page up or page down key.Again, the colors are changed by pressing the LED key continually the one with the \"light\" icon on it.Installation - the manual explains it but you simply turn your pc completely off - unplug old keyboard put this one in the USB then start computer it auto recognizes it and goes to Windows Update to do something then it works fine.It has the two tabs in the back to raise it up but these seem to not do much at all but it feels fine the tilt or height or whatever.Overall measurements 9 inches in width - 19 inches in length.",

                "reviewText": "My old keyboard had larger keys, but that's not a problem for me. I found that for me, the bigger keys just made it easier to hit two of them at the same time.There are too many nice things about this keyboard to list and others have already done a good job of that. I use lighted keyboards because I am a night person and like to stay up late. I only sleep 4-5 hours a night, so since I don't want to turn on lights and wake anyone up, a lighted keyboard allows me to leave the lights off and still see the keys. I have had my old lighted keyboard for 8 years and it still works fine, but the colors weren't as bright as they used to be and after 8 years of eating where I work and watch TV, I started having to pop sticky keys off and clean it fairly often. This keyboard does a lot more than my old one. I like all the features and the colors are bright and can be adjusted higher or lower to my preference.The only small complaint I have is that there were no instructions in the box. I came back to Amazon to ask if anyone knew how to change the colors and found those instructions here. I do wish they had said to use the key with the light, or sun on it instead of saying use the LED key. I was searching for a key that said LED when I finally noticed the right one. The explanation for the alternate function key choices was also missing, but they are fairly self explanatory. If this one lasts that long, I'll be very happy.I gave it 5 stars overall. I gave it 5 stars for Gaming. Even though I'm not a gamer, I'm sure it will work fine for that, but not being a gamer wasn't a choice. 5 stars for brightness because I had to turn it down. 5 stars for value for money. My last keyboard lasted 8 years, so that comes out to about $3.75 a year. If this one lasts even half as long it's still a great value.",

                "reviewText": "Great inexpensive keyboard and does what it needs to. Not my cup of tea when typing or hitting keys. They're very stiff keys and low profile. My kids (8 and 13) on the other hand love em but they don't know how smooth cherry mx reds feel... So for them these keyboards are great and they light up to match their computers. I got both my kids these keyboards and so far so good. The lighting is brite enough during the day and great a night. The lettering isn't that clear as stated in some other reviews but you can make out which key is which. All the other keyboards we looked at online were rainbow rgb and the kids wanted solid colors. This keyboard doesn't do any fancy lighting shows but it does color match their set ups and that's all they need.Overall if a friend needed an inexpensive quick keyboard with some style points. I'd recommend this until they could save for a proper keyboard.",

I don\u2019t use it for gaming but just liked the idea of the light up effect and the different colour options which makes it nice and easy to see the keys. I would have given it 5* but I soon discovered that the @ button and the \u201c button are the wrong way around so @ is actually \u201c and vice versa. If you remember that it\u2019s a great keyboard.",
