If you are looking for a great mechanical keyboard and don\u2019t want to deal with all the BS that doesn\u2019t matter, this is the keyboard to buy. Especially if you can find on sale as I did and get for $50 or under.I needed a new keyboard to complete my home nerd center where I work and play video games. I went from the Dell Membrane keyboard that my employer gave me to this MechanicalKeyboard after going through three keyboards due to how much I use, I also type hard. This checked all the boxes for me and I love it so very much.Great look with its brushed aluminum top plate to keep these wonderful feeling PBT keys and brown switches in place. There isn\u2019t software to run RGB and you have 5-6 different lighting settings that\u2019s controlled with Function F12, perfection. I didn\u2019t want another program to run on my PC and the default lights are bright, clear and look clean with the white. In the middle of the day the keys are easy to read and see, when keyboard lights are out the keys look black. Lights reset after every power down cycle on your computer so if that\u2019s something that annoys you maybe buy something else, for me this is exactly what I needed.The feel and sound of the keys and switches are great. I type hard and the longer throw of the keys and feel of them is just wonderful. The sound makes me happy and the feel has me wanting to type up rants to all my exes.In love! Great price and Great feel. Video included so y\u2019all\u2019s can hear the wonderful sounds emanating from this great product.Update; still in love swooning out here. Including pics of some keycaps that look sexy. Pics do no justice how good these white keys made it. Duel colorway is the best.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not a gamer and just wanted a very good quality, backlit keyboard. I don't like these newer keyboards that have basically flat keys; I prefer the good, tactile feel of the keys on this one and like having the full travel and responsive feedback of the keys on this Logitech keyboard.The backlighting is very nice and the key fonts are bold, bright, and easy to read. It's simple and just white color, which I also like, as I don't care about having different colors and effects.I got this one to replace another, similar gaming keyboard, of which two had gone bad, with LEDs going out and eventually keys not working. Hoping this name-brand one will last longer. I'm not a hard user, so I feel that something like this should last longer than the others did.The keys on this one are not as 'clicky' as the old one was, but they are still perfect for me, as they feel just as responsive, but aren't quite as noisy.So far I give this a full five stars, because it works exceptionally well and feels solid and well-made. I would definitely recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "Great build, love the feel. I was actually hoping for a little louder of the clicky sound. But it does have a good sound to it. Probably would be annoying in an open cubicle office environment like others say. The ONLY drawback for me is I wish the function keys lit up where the icons are for what the function keys do. If your keyboard area isn't well lit you can't see those icons AT ALL. I considered taking a star off for this issue but I like the keyboard enough to not take off one star. It is just the right size for me. Straight and simple design and the backlighting is great! Highly recommend for someone looking for a straight simple keyboard that gets the job done.",

If you want a mechanical but don\u2019t want the green or blue switches. This is a nice more quiet variety. It\u2019ll still click, but it isn\u2019t a clack fest. Enough about sound and impact. Function keys work well and is compatible with the steam deck! Solid choice in response and ergonomics and will last due to proper quality as Logitech is known for. If you want a clean setup for the office with better feel than a basic keyboard this is great. If you are a gamer you will love it! This is a well rounded and tasteful mechanical keyboard!It\u2019s worth it\u2019s value and price, also the white backlights are great in low light situations!",
