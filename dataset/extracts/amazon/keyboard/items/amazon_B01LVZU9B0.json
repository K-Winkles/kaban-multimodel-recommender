                "reviewText": "I bought this back in March of 2018 and I'm still using this keyboard. The lights still work and most of the keyboard is still going great. The three color options still work just fine.The only issues that I have with it at this time, some four years on, is:* \"H\" key doesn't want to press down all the way. Need to really bop it at times now.* Surface of the \"H\" key is rather smooth at this point and sometimes squeaks when I type.* Space bar feels like it's stuck slightly pressed, yet nonetheless works just fine.* The \"feet\" under the keyboard that raises it slightly off of the surface are long gone. They popped off easily.I type casually at 85 to 90 WPM and can push above 100 WPM. It wasn't that long ago that I wrote an entire NaNoWriMo story in under a week. That's 50,0000 words in less than 7 days, or over 8,000 words per day.Although this cheap keyboard is now showing its age a bit - here's looking at you, \"H\" key, why you gotta do me this way - how are you going to complain about a fifteen dollar back lit keyboard that still works more or less just fine after heavy daily use some four years later.",

                "reviewText": "This keyboard is low cost with illuminated keys in Red (default), Blue and Purple. The backlight is not on a LED per key basis, but appears to be via light plate behind the keys. The light plate is the key base and is painted black where the light shouldn't come thru. The result is the baseplate is brighter than the key tops. The keys are not double shot, they are milky white (translucent) with black paint over the key. I guess the paint is then removed by laser or some other method. This means if you have oily fingers such as I do, or use some keys a lot, it is possible the black paint will wear off causing the area around the key characters to let out the backlight. I am thinking I may over spray the keyboard with clear polyurethane spray to extend the use of the keycaps longer.The key mechanism seems to be a standard membrane with a firm dome. It is not a true mechanical key. No click clack. However, due to the firm dome it takes a little more force to start the keypress, then once part way down the dome collapses. This gives a mechanical feeling to the keypress. The keypress is not loud, (no clicks or clacks) but maybe slightly higher in volume than a standard membrane keyboard.The keys on this keyboard have a high profile. This means if you are used to using a laptop or wireless keyboard with low profile keys, this keyboard will take some time getting use to.Overall - an okay low cost keyboard with backlight for occasional use. This keyboard seems pretty much exactly the same as the Mafiti keyboard (which is a little less $15 vs $17). Considering the cost, it is a good occasional use keyboard for the low cost $17.Pros: nice feel to the keys backlight selectable in a solid color default backlight is redCons: painted key cap characters which may wear off after some time backlight is brighter in some areas than others backlight is brighter behind the keys than on top.",

Keys are NOT stiff but you feel them when you type.It is wired which I chose intentionally. It might be just me but wireless KB's always seem to lag.To cheap to buy a gamesters KB.",

                "reviewText": "Received promptly, was packaged appropriately. It goes to show that I didn't read the entire name of the product when I ordered it. Main reason for purchasing this was the price which was appealing. My surprise came a day or two after I received this keyboard when I hit the sun icon and changed the color from the initial red to blue then purple then no light and back to red.The quality I have observed is great but I've only owned this keyboard for just over a week. An issue I've had with other keyboards especially my built in laptop keyboard was that tiny materials tend to get stuck under the keys or they just plain get dirty over time and are hard to clean without risking damage if you're not so careful. Thus, the raised keys not only let the visually appealing lights shine through, but they mean cleaning is much easier; not that I'd be doing that this early.The feel of the keys was another good factor while using it. Staying true to the gamer aspect of things, your typical AWSD keys have a bolder font to them. The function keys up top also lend to ease of use when it comes to knowing what they do. There might be some hesitation when it comes to the keyboard being wired or wireless. There was no such trouble when it came to having this keyboard be wired, the cord is long enough.All in all, a very solid keyboard so far and I'd consider purchasing another one and bringing it to my workplace and swapping out the boring old keyboard with this one.",
