Bought it for a replacement of my daughter's external keyboard, the USB was thin and wore out in less than 3 months. I don't think she's ready for a $100 Razer keyboard yet, and wanted something cheaper but not s*** tier quality neither. This was definitely the right choice.The cord isn't breaded but it's definitely thicker, and has a higher quality connector than her previous cheap keyboard. The keys are all very responsive and feel nice, near silent besides the spacebar. Bright LEDs and lots of color patterns you can change via the keyboard - not needing to download special software to control the LEDs is nice.Overall great build quality. No frill packaging. How it should be. Recommend, great budget keyboard.",

                "reviewText": "I've had the keyboard a few hours now. it's perfect, I feel very good about this purchase! Great colors, and design. The keys feel great to type on. The lights are easy to switch and turn on and off. Everything works. I am very happy with my purchase. Thank you for making such a great and affordable keyboard. The fonts on the keys are really nice and modern too.It is quieter than a mechanical keyboard, and I'd say the noise level is about average. You won't be annoyed by the noise, but I suppose their are quieter keyboards out there for more money. It's a good noise level though.Often in life we are let down, but you will not be let down by the awesomeness of this keyboard. I'm thrilled with my purchase.",

It works well. (Note: the keyboard doesn't stay lit all the time. If you leave it inactive for awhile, it goes dark, but then lights right back up again when you touch it.)",
