                "reviewText": "As a long-time Apple user, I've always been a fan of their sleek and minimalistic designs. When I recently decided to upgrade my desktop setup, the Apple Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad was a no-brainer for me.Right out of the box, the Magic Keyboard impresses with its stylish and slim design. The build quality is excellent, as expected from an Apple product, and it feels sturdy yet lightweight. The keys have a low profile, and the scissor-switch mechanism provides a satisfying and responsive typing experience. The added numeric keypad is a game-changer for those of us who frequently work with numbers, making data entry and calculations much more efficient.The Magic Keyboard connects effortlessly via Bluetooth to any Apple device, and the set-up process is a breeze. The built-in rechargeable battery is another great feature, as it eliminates the need for constantly replacing batteries. A single charge lasts me several weeks of regular use, and recharging is as simple as connecting the keyboard to my computer with the included Lightning cable.The only minor drawback I've encountered is that the keyboard may occasionally lose connection for a brief moment, but this has been a rare occurrence and is quickly resolved by turning the keyboard off and back on again.Overall, the Apple Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad is a fantastic addition to any Apple-centric workspace. Its sleek design, comfortable typing experience, and added functionality with the numeric keypad make it well worth the investment. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality keyboard to complement their Apple devices.",

                "reviewText": "This Apple keyboard is luxurious. It feels good, it looks good, it's quiet, and it is reliable. It is not, however, waterproof. This purchase was to replace a keyboard I damaged with spilled liquid.I love having the numeric keypad as I use it frequently. Note this does not have Touch ID. Bluetooth connectivity to my iMac is never an issue. I have an older spare of this same keyboard I use for other things, mainly connecting to my tv (I hate having to use a remote control to enter passwords!) and my iPhone (I equally hate thumb texting!). I can always check the state of the charge of the keyboard through my iMac, though my iMac will tell me when I need to charge it. I think I charge it once every two or three months, taking probably two to three hours for a full charge.There are other keyboards available for the Mac, but this one works just fine as long as you keep liquids out of it! I would recommend this keyboard.",
