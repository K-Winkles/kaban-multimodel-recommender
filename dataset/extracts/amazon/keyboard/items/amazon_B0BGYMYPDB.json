                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I recently purchased the DIERYA T68SE Wired 60% Mechanical Gaming Keyboard in white, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations. This keyboard combines the convenience of a compact layout with the exceptional performance of mechanical switches, making it a standout choice for both gaming and office use.First and foremost, the build quality of this keyboard is outstanding. The compact 68-key layout not only saves precious desk space, but it also feels solid and durable. The sleek white design with LED backlighting adds a touch of elegance and enhances the overall aesthetic of my setup. The keyboard is also accompanied by a convenient stand-alone arrow/control key cluster, allowing for easy navigation and efficiency.The highlight of the DIERYA T68SE is undoubtedly its clicky blue mechanical switches. They deliver a satisfying tactile feedback with an audible click, making each keystroke a delight. The actuation force is just right, providing a pleasant typing experience for extended periods. Whether I'm typing up documents or engaging in intense gaming sessions, the responsiveness and accuracy of the switches are remarkable.The LED backlighting is another commendable feature. The vibrant and customizable lighting effects add a visually pleasing element to the keyboard. The ability to adjust brightness and choose from various lighting modes allows for personalization, matching my mood or gaming environment effortlessly.Setting up the keyboard was a breeze. It is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux, so I had no issues connecting it to my Windows laptop. The included USB cable is of good quality and ensures a reliable connection.One minor drawback I encountered is the lack of dedicated media control keys. Although it doesn't hinder the overall functionality of the keyboard, having dedicated media keys would have been a nice addition for convenience.In conclusion, the DIERYA T68SE Wired 60% Mechanical Gaming Keyboard is an impressive peripheral that offers a blend of functionality, performance, and style. Its compact form factor, clicky blue switches, and customizable LED backlighting make it an excellent choice for gamers and professionals alike. Despite the absence of dedicated media keys, this keyboard deserves a solid five-star rating for its exceptional performance and value for money.",

For that it works well and is very cost effective. In particular I like that this one still has arrow keys in the proper orientation. I use those a lot while typing and moving around documents so any keyboard that omits them or lays them out weird (ie via the Fn key or not in the \"cross\" arrangement) really hampers me.",
