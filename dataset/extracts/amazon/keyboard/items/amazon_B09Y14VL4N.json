                "reviewText": "When reviewers stated that this was a quiet keyboard and there was no lag-time - decided to give it a try. I have a complete HP suite now and they all work fabulously together. Quiet, fast, and no lag time just as advertised and reviewed. The system is also faster as the system does not seem to be fighting to connect all the time. Best of all, the Windows applications all work as designed - right click, drag and drop, keyboard shortcuts, numbers lock, etc., they all work. Thanks to all of you that came before me and wrote the types of meaningful reviews a buyer could use.",

                "reviewText": "I used the wired model of this keyboard, and was looking for the wireless version for transitioning between working from home and going back to the office, but without having to learn new muscle memory by buying a different keyboard model altogether. Shipping was speedy to PR. Set up to my HP laptop for both keyboard and mouse was straightforward. The keys are quiet so co workers nearby are not bothered by typing noise, yet the keys feel smooth and are satisfying to press. Definitely enjoying the wireless capability as it eliminates cable clutter at my desk. Definitely worth it!",

                "reviewText": "I've only had the keyboard and mouse set for a couple of months, return window passed. These are in fact made in China, even though HP has tried to move out of there. It shows. Both KB and M stop working for 4-5 sec at a time about every 2 minutes. They seem to be doing a hard reset of the IRQ because when it happens, I can hear a tap sound in the speakers. Swapping to an older setup stopped this. I guess I'm not getting rid of wires, the tech isn't good enough, not when it's made in China anyway.Other problems, there's no way to put down or pick up the keyboard without pressing the keys, so I invariably activate the emoji button or the microphone, or the screenshot.... or lock the screen. Why does a full size keyboard need to be also compact? That's just crazy design. It should be comfortable. HP failed the obvious flaw test this time. Even if they only saw a picture of the design it should've been clearly flawed.You have to hold Fn to then press any F key, so it's Fn-F12 if you want to get into the boot options for example. Which is pretty nutty. Cool that it works wirelessly at all, but try typing that at the correct moment quickly.It's super slow, I have to slow my touch typing or it just stops accepting input for around 5 seconds. Other times I have to find the key that's stuck down whiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiile it types a long line like that. Then there ar the skipped letters like that. Happens a lot, about 30 times a day.I kept thinking it was Windows 11 or wireless, or there was some fix. There's no fix. This KBM set is just bad. A reboot fixes it for about an hour then it's back to bad behavior. Pure junk, do not buy it. Clearly marked Made in China on the back of the Keyboard and I can't find any maker's mark on the mouse at all.HP should pull every one of these off the market. And offer a recall for those who tried to find a fix and let their refund period expire. Total junk.",
