                "reviewText": "I purchased this combo to use with my multimedia computer in my living room. It does a great job overall, and I'd recommend purchasing to anyone who needs a barebone keyboard that is more reliable than bluetooth. With that short review out of the way, let's get into my longer analysis. I promise it won't be too long.First, the good:The mouse is quiet! I didn't see that on the listing when I first looked at the product (though it does mention it plainly, so that's on me.) The scroll wheel feels normal (which is a good thing - many cheap mice squeak or feel way too loose), and the variable DPI settings are amazing on a mouse at this price point.The keyboard is relatively quiet as well, with a few exceptions that will come in the next section. Both devices are more reliable than the bluetooth set that I replaced with this purchase.Next, the not-so-good. To be fair, these are nitpicks, and aren't deal breakers at all.The keyboard feels cheap. The keys, while responsive, have a less-than-premium feel when you actuate them. My spacebar and 0 key on the number pad are also much louder than the rest of the keys, and have a small squeaking sound to them. There are plenty of shortcuts on this keyboard - I like the search, refresh, and calculator buttons the best by far. The multimedia controls are missing a dedicated mute button, but they are also very nice to have - however, the function keys have some duplicate shortcuts that make me scratch my head in confusion. Specifically, the f2, f3, f5-f8, and f11 keys are duplicates and essentially wasted, unless you really need 2 different ways to press the play button on Despacito.They call the keyboard and mouse ergonomic - and the mouse is - but I hesitate to agree when it comes to the keyboard. It does have a wrist rest, made of hard plastic, but it's not the most comfortable to use.Overall a great product, and I hope this helps you decide whether to get it or not!",

                "reviewText": "I love that this keyboard has a slot to place your phone which I use often when I am working and don't want to place my phone on the charger. This lets me see any incoming calls or messages when I am working. The keyboard fits well with smaller desks and won't take up too much desk space as you see in the picture. I have a small desk and still have room left over for other items. Some drawbacks that I must mention which is the reason it lost 2 stars. The first is that I had to change the battery almost a month after receiving it. This could be because I use cheap batteries, but I have used other keyboards such as Logitech and the battery will last more than a month. A good way to get around this would probably be to just turn of the keyboard and mouse when not in use, but I always forget to do this. So far after having the product for about 2 months, i have changed the battery twice. The other draw back is that it that the keyboard and mouse turn off after like 2-3 minutes of inactivity which makes it a little frustrating but with time i have come to get used to taping on the keyboard or mouse before using it to reactivate them. For this reason I would not recommend this item for gaming use as you will be very frustrated. For work from home it is perfect once you get used to the constant turning off. However this is not the reason why it lost the second star. The reason is because the keyboard recently started glitching when playing Minecraft where the character would suddenly start jumping on its own or would walk a different direction. To fix this issue I just unplugged the dongle from the computer and reinserted it. However there should be no need for this and that is why this review is a 3 star.",
