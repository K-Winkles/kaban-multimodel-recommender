                "reviewText": "First things first. Some people complained about the mouse turning itself off. REALLY? Just tap the button on top of it and it starts back up. This feature saves battery! Are these critics really competitors?I'm a connoisseur of keyboards and mouses though not by choice. I've spilled coffee on and ruined four keyboards. I've replaced each with a different model, trying to find something better. And of course I've used countless other keyboards and mouses at work, on my kids' and friends' computers, etc.From the moment they came out of the box, the keyboard and mouse look and feel better-made than others. They're slightly heavier and stiffer than others. When you shake them they rattle noticeably less than others. The keys are symmetric with each other. The gap around the keys is narrower than on other keyboards. The mouse has no gap between the right and left click buttons, making its construction stiffer.The keyboard is flatter than most but not too flat, which makes it comfortable for my wrists. The keyboard is compact, a smidge narrower and shorter than others on the horizontal plane, which combined with its flatness makes it more transportable. The keys are a bit flatter than normal external keyboards, which makes for quicker action. The keys are also not as flat as those on laptops which I've never gotten used to. The keyboard 'action' - the resistance and bounce-back - are just right, smooth and not too stiff or loose. The keyboard has Caps, Num Lock, and Power indicator lights - not all of them do. Best of all, this is the quietest keyboard I've owned. I'm hard on keyboards but this one feels like it's gonna last forever.The mouse is a bit shorter than others, which makes it comfortable to my hand. The top of the mouse has a slight matte finish instead of glossy, which feels nice to the touch and enables accurate clicking. The mouse has nice click and bounce-back and feels durable. The mouse wheel has a nice grip and looks elegant.In summary, the make, action, size, and energy features make this my favorite-ever keyboard. Buy it!",

                "reviewText": "After my old keyboard and mouse died, I needed a replacement to take on business trips. I settled on this keyboard because I prefer a full size keyboard with the number pad attached and this was the best deal I could find. This keyboard mouse combo is on its 3rd trip to Europe and still works great and is on the first set of batteries still for the both of them. Sleep mode works and the mouse and keyboard are very reactive to your motions or key strokes.",

                "reviewText": "For keyboards and mice, Logitech is usually my go-to company - I've used their products for years and have always been impressed with the quality. That said, their prices have gone up dramatically lately and I can't justify spending $60 to $80 on a keyboard and mouse anymore. So when my five year old MK570 Logitech keyboard finally started to die, I decided to check out some other options and after looking at the reviews, settled on this one.Overall I'm happy with this combo. considering the $25 price tag it feels surprisingly solid. The keyboard works well, no sticky keys or any problems there. Despite what some reviews say, there is indeed a light that lets you know when the Caps Lock is enabled. It feels a little small, but coming from the larger Logitech keyboards I was expecting to have to adjust. I like the power saving mode, saves me the trouble of switching the devices on and off myself - after 10 minutes of inactivity the mouse goes to sleep and a simple click restores it. The mouse feels comfortable and fits into my palm nicely.For the negatives, well I guess 'whisper click' means something different to the manufacturers because this mouse is by no means quiet click. It's not the loudest I've heard but its definitely noticeable. Not a big deal to me, but if you're looking at this set for quiet operation I think you'll be disappointed. The only other issue I encountered was that I found the receiver incredibly stiff and annoyingly difficult to insert into the USB port, to the point where I actually thought I had it upside down. Normally it takes very little pressure to insert these but for this one I had to push it hard to the point I was concerned something would break. Not sure if this is the case for everyone or if I just got a weird one, but be aware especially if you're constantly using your USB ports like I do.About 2 weeks of heavy use so far and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a economical keyboard/mouse who doesn't need all the bells and whistles. I will update this review if I see any decline in quality over the coming months, but so far so good!",

I do find that the mouse goes into power saving mode if it\u2019s not in use for a while but as soon as you click on the mouse or keyboard, it wakes back up. I do appreciate the power saving mode. I updated my review from 5 stars down to 3 because only after a few months of use, all of the letters on the keyboard have disappeared including the letters that are not frequently used. It was not meant to withstand daily use. The price is great but if you work from home and need the mouse and keyboard on a daily basis, I\u2019d recommend spending more and buying something that will last more than a few months",
