                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Solid keyboard with lots of features",
                "reviewText": "Reviewed: White w/ RGB lights, blue switchesOverall rating: 9/10 (36/40 = 90% recommendation)After doing alot of research, I chose this keyboard based on a few factors that were very important to me: PRICE, QUALITY, FUNCTION, & AESTHETICS. As I was in the market for a keyboard for the purposes of typing, gaming is not a factor in this review. Overall, I think this keyboard delivered pretty well in almost all areas that were key in my purchasing decision.Price: 10/10Of course I would always want the lowest price possible, but I think given the quality and features of this keyboard, the price is pretty reasonable - especially considering that it feels substantial (overall good build quality, metal construction) and the high number of very customizable lighting effects. At this price, from what I could find, this keyboard simply can't be beat.Quality: 10/10I am really impressed by how solid this keyboard feels. The base is sturdy, the LEDs are very bright (with beautifully smooth transitions), and the blue switches provide delicious tactile and audible feedback. It makes this keyboard truly a joy to use (yes, I am writing this review with it right now!). The keycaps themselves are a hard plastic that adds to the well-made and solid feeling of the keyboard overall.Function: 7/10While overall the keyboard is received is perfectly functional, I was ideally looking for one in this same style (white, RGB, mechanical), but with a 10 key number pad built in as well. It just does not exist for the most part. There are other brands that provide the 10 key functionality, but based on those reviews they are either not good quality, or in my search others were out of the price range for what I was willing to spend. Additionally, I use a Mac - while this keyboard is basically compatible, I would love to see some options for an RGB mechanical keyboard that is more made for Mac. This one gets the job done - but it does leave some to be desired as far as dedicated features go. As I stated earlier under quality, the function of the keys is incredibly satisfying to type on. I have also found the functions to choose the color pattern and speed of the LEDs to be straightforward and easy to use. I am particularly impressed by the smooth, beautiful transitions and fades of the built-in patterns.Aesthetics: 9/10Finally - I was specifically looking for a white mechanical keyboard with RGB functionality. I know that this limited my options substantially right off the bat. I chose this one because the layout is simple and beautiful, the range and possibility of LED color combinations, and for its compact size (if I couldn't find a 10 key option, I figured my next best bet was to choose one that was reasonably compact). The font of the keycaps is not a personal favorite of mine, so I could see myself potentially changing out the keycaps at some point, but that is a low priority for me in the grand scheme. Overall, this keyboard looks great on my desk and I am really pleased with the compact size and the white color. Other than not having a 10 key option, this keyboard was aesthetically almost EXACTLY what I had envisioned.Overall I am very satisfied with this keyboard and I am happy that I chose it. I will update this review should anything change or if I realize I forgot to mention any important aspects. I hope this review has been helpful to you, and thanks for reading!",

                "reviewText": "I love this keyboard. I have it set to solid purple and my mouse matching it. It has many, many options. It is kinda fun to play with the light options although I leave it set to a solid color when I am using it. It is loud, but that turned out to be a good thing. You can hear when a key is pressed hard enough to produce a letter and you don't have to watch your screen for visual confirmation of that. This allows you to watch keyboard as you type if needed. This will lead to fewer mistakes and missed keys or double keys. My daughter said it was loud, but her typing was great on it.My daughter tried my keyboard and is getting one just like mine. I ordered a different model for my husband. He needed programmable macros and this one does not have 10 key or programmable macros. He does use 10 key. This seems to be a good company based on my past experience with their other products. This keyboard appears to be better made than any keyboard I have owned. It takes up less space and I never use the 10 key on keyboards. I needed a smaller keyboard because I have a Midi and a pen tablet taking up real-estate on my desk. I am able to game longer without having to rest my hands.I had no problem learning to setup the lights like I wanted. There are way more options than I expected. I'm really happy I got the RGB model. The included manual mentioned software and a site but I learned this model is plug and play and doesn't need an app to use. There was different site for the products on Amazon and it listed as plug and play 100%. If you loose the manual, its on site with instructions on changing and setting up the keyboard with key commands. The different model I got my husband had a driver there and I was able to verify that before I ordered his model.We have all been using the Perdition Mouse M901 for a while. We loved the mice and they have lasted. My daughters is the very first model and its its still great and she games all the time. Also its nice that my keyboard and mouse kinda match and look good together. My desk looks so much better with these on it.",

I didn\u2019t have money to buy a new one at the time so after hella searching, I got this. It was supposed to be temporary but I love it so much I\u2019m not replacing it unless it breaks- I\u2019d still buy this one again tho. The quality feels the same to razor for the most part. The 75% gives me so much space on my desk too !! :) 10/10 buy. Price range is so worth it",

Estou muito satisfeito com o ele.S\u00f3 acho que devo pontuar que, se voc\u00ea \u00e9 uma pessoa que gosta de teclados mais baixos ou mais suaves, pode se incomodar com esse teclado, pois as teclas s\u00e3o um pouco mais altas do que um teclado tradicional, mas nada que incomode, apenas se voc\u00ea s\u00f3 for do tipo que gosta de algo mais fino.No mais, \u00e9 um produto excelente, pode comprar sem medo.",

Siento que es un teclado robusto, y sin pad num\u00e9rico me da m\u00e1s espacio para mover el mouse, cosa que me agrada mucho.La iluminaci\u00f3n es buena (muy buena en mi opini\u00f3n), pero no es tan potente como la de mi anterior teclado, aunque para m\u00ed la iluminaci\u00f3n no es tan importante. Adem\u00e1s, tiene su software para controlar la iluminaci\u00f3n y macrosMe encant\u00f3 el sonido del teclado y el tacto, es algo ruidoso, s\u00ed, pero comparando el sonido con el de mi otro teclado este se escucha y se siente mejor.Aunque pens\u00e9 que las letras de las teclas se ver\u00edan como las de la foto, el teclado lleg\u00f3 con otras, pero est\u00e1 bien.",
