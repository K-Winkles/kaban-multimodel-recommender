Bluetooth connectivity works well unless you have a lot of other Bluetooth devices running in the area. The 2.4 dongle works just as well. A couple of really cool things, is that it has a Groove in the upper left side to put your phone and that is really cool. Also, it has a silicon sheet to cover the keyboard. It fits like a glove and it keeps debris, like dust or crumbs, because I'm a slob, out of my keyboard. This works well.",

I'm used to Logitec and Dell keyboards so I'm having to relearn the location of some keys, like the Delete key on my laptop and wireless Logitec keyboards is the function lock key on this keyboard. I'll get used to it.Things I like so far: easy to connect, easy to charge, self storage for the dongle, comes with its own silicone keyboard skin, low profile keyboard and mouse (I have small hands so I like the low profile mouse and short key travel.)Things I do not appreciate now but I hope I will get used to: optional silicone cover slows gliding from one key to next (not a surprise, just inconvenient but worth the added protection); phone holder isn't really a big enough opening for most phone cases (I have an S21 5G in a clear Otterbox Symmetry but nothing thicker will fit); keyboard layout is wide like an old wired keyboard, I have small hands so this means my hands travel pretty far left to right while working, the mouse wheel has a pronounced \"click\" feeling when scrolling but there is no \"click\" feeling when you left or right click (I prefer no wheel click but a left and right button click)Something that doesn't matter to me but may matter to some: there are no feet to adjust the keyboard angle.I'll try to remember to update this in a month or 2.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this as a second try for a multi-device keyboard/mouse combo. My first try was another unknown brand, called Rapoo. That one was not rechargeable. I was not specifically looking for rechargeable, but it's nice.In the Rapoo, I was having a ton of issues. I believe most of my problems were caused by bluetooth 3.0. This one has bluetooth 5, and it definitely makes a difference. I have not had any issues connecting the keyboard or mouse at all. I have one computer on bluetooth and one computer on the wireless adapter that comes inside the keyboard. Both connections are very smooth. Maybe once or twice a week, the bluetooth connection will spaz out for 2 or 3 seconds (inserting extra characters when I'm typing something), and then will be fine. On the Rapoo it was pretty much constant, often to the point that it was impossible to do anything. The battery on the keyboard has been pretty much full the whole time I've been using it. You can easily check the battery level by pressing the FN-lock button and the battery button on the keyboard. As far as I can tell it has been pretty much full the entire time. I just plugged in the mouse for the first time since the initial charge, and I can still use the mouse while it's charging. The keyboard buttons click very well, and as some have pointed out, the keyboard comes with a plastic cover to keep it free from dust/debris.The mouse is quite another story. The buttons are so sensitive that any time you flip it over to change the device connection, you click a button. In fact, it's pretty easy to accidentally click a button even if you aren't touching the buttons themselves, because you can click from the center of the palm rest. Others here complained about the mouse wheel - I think the wheel is fine. I'm trying to get used to the buttons, but I may end up replacing just the mouse. The only reason I haven't yet is because I don't want to use another USB port for the 2.4 GHz wireless connection.The keyboard alone is worth the cost of this.",

This paired in seconds with both! (Separately)Follow the pairing instructions (they're included) if you're doing bluetooth only. It immediately paired with last known device when we stopped using it for a bit, and after shutting it off to conserve battery.Rechargeable battery life is about what I expect (approx 4 to 5 days if converted to constant use, so like 96 to 120 hrs). 2 hr recharge time back to full. (We tested it but tbh just charge it at night now that we know.)Only comes with one type C usb charger cable (they both have to be charged separately, mouse and keyboard). But honestly those are super common and we have several so just the one was perfect, not a big deal.She likes the dust cover it comes with and how it feels, I personally don't but it's just because I've used keyboards similar to this for so long the texture feels odd to me and I prefer to type on plastic. It's a good material and a snug fit, and doesn't impede use at all. Just not my thing.When my external keyboard breaks I'm getting one of these for myself. Works great!",

It took forever (weeks) for the order to process (with zero communication about the delay) so I was without a keyboard for weeks longer than expected. Then it was missing a key when it arrived. I tried contacting Amazon support and they said I'd have to send it back and buy a new one, which I daresay would take months longer. I am desperate and can use the keyboard as is, but far from ideal. The mouse buttons also don't work reliably and some of the keys stick. Overall, I do not recommend this productUpdated to say I've decided to send it back, unfortunately I'm out of pocket $40 for postage (Amazon have already said they won't reimburse me) so all in all it was a really bad idea to buy this",
