The keyboard is short on features, if you're the type who wants G-keys and fancy shmancy individually colored LED's and all that jazz, but what it lacks in gaudy gamer grease it makes up for by being perfect for what it is. It does have media control keys readily accessible with FN-F# key combinations, but the only thing I wish it did have that it doesn't are a few dedicated media control buttons above the numpad.Not enough of a complaint to sour me on the keyboard, though, I'm extremely happy with it. The backlight is functional and good looking, the aluminum base has enough weight that it doesn't slide around when you're using it, and the tactile feel of the keys is absolutely perfect. For me, personally, this is as close to perfect as any keyboard I've ever owned, and it does it without breaking the bank.",

                "reviewText": "Wanted a basic mechanical keyboard that is relatively quiet and will work with a Unix based OS without needing a virtual machine or dual booting to control it. This does *exactly* that. I couldn't be happier.The only real Fn+F# mappings are Fn+F1,F2 & F12 for lighting. Most FN keys can be programmed up on your own in X or Wayland or whatever, which is what I already have. XF86 references exist for Fn+F4,F6-F11. Fn+F3, F5 do not appear to have mappings in the driver. This is probably a driver update issue either with X or OpenBSD, and is in no way a show stopper.Hardware itself is very sturdy. The TTC Red switches were reviewed as being the quietest option. I still feel those switches are a little clackier than I expected, but this is probably to be expected with an aluminum body. The keys have perfect key travel and are very light touch, which is what I really want. Keycap printing is very clear. Illumination levels work just fine. The USB cable is permanently attached, USBA, pliable, and thick- all of which I consider good qualities for a keyboard I'll be keeping and repairing.Key layout is also very comfortable and matches well with my \"typist\" typing style; not having to re-map any keypresses into my muscle memory. Typing on this keyboard is *much* faster than on my old $35 \"thin\" membrane keyboard, so I'm pretty happy overall. Definitely worth the minimal investment for probably at least a decade of use.",

                "reviewText": "Life with the new keyboard is really awesome. I mean, I loved my Logitech G510, but it died after many long years of good service.I wasn't sure the keyboard would work, since it wasn't shipped as I would have expected. It was like someone took the keyboard off the shelf (in the product box) and slapped a shipping label on it. No outer packaging and protection other than how the manufacturer boxed it.I do more office related work at home these days and less gaming that requires the cool features and bells and whistles, and wanted to go to the mechanical keyboards for efficience with typing.I like the feel of the keys beneath my fingers, perfectly spaced for fast typing without having to pound the keys. The simple backlighting is perfect as well. No frills, just a simple efficient white light. The characters on the keys are unimportant to me as I don't look at the keys when I type, BUT... looking at the keyboard, I find the \"font\" of the key characters to be perfectly readable and very attractive looking.As for the \"quietness\" of the keys, it would depend on your definition of quiet. I chose the red because I'm a fast typist and like the smoothness of flow, so rather than going for the brown and quiet, I'm satisfied with my choice. The sound of the keys is not much louder than my old keyboard.Since I always use a wrist pad regardless of the keyboard, there was no adjustment to the height of the keyboard, which I actually found not as high as many complain that it is. I can use it comfortably without a wrist pad.I've had no issues with the lighting -- yet. So far so good. I couldn't see where to adjust the lighting. It didn't come with a manual so I had to go to the Logitech site to get that information. Not a biggie.For the price? It's well worth it.UPDATE: October 18, 2021. I noticed for the first time this morning when cleaning off my desk that the \"M\" key and the \"ALT\" key no longer light up. In fact the text is now dark gray. Not a big deal for me, since I don't need to look at the keyboard to type. I suppose this is what typing 95 wpm does to the keyboard. I'm still loving the keyboard and would definitely recommend!UPDATE: January 26, 2021. I've got a couple of keys that have \"died\". That is, they still work, but the key itself feels \"dead\" and you have to pound it with your finger harder to make it type out the letter. I'm going to be doing a good cleaning this weekend and hopefully that will help. Otherwise, I'll be reaching out to the manufacturer on this issue.",

The three lock indicator lights (NumLock, CapsLock, and ScrollLock) are bright and clear, but not glaring.I swapped in my existing set of translucent keycaps with impact-dampening O-rings, and it was an entirely painless process. They've never looked better. The minimalist style of this board puts the focus on the keys. No chunky trim, no garish decals.Before my mechanical keyboard days, my daily driver was the old Logitech Illuminated with scissor switches. This right here is an excellent update on that concept: a sleek, comfortable keyboard that looks and feels great.",

                "reviewText": "I have used an IBM model M keyboard for years and wanted to see if new mechanical keyboards could be a substitute. This logitech keyboard with the MX Cherry Blue switches is good, but does not come close to the feel and feedback of the IBM keyboard. However, the build quality of the keyboard is solid like the IBM and is much more compact. Ergonomics are close and is very comfortable to use for extended periods of time. I am not a gamer so I cannot review on how good it is for gaming. Though the MX cherry switches are supposed to be quite heavy I don't find that compared to the IBM. I type quite hard bottoming out the keys and a solid feel is important. I say it is good for the office but, those around you may get annoyed as this keyboard is quite loud as with most clicky mechanical keyboards. I also have a Red Dragon K552 with the MX cherry red clone switches which feels very close to the Logitech. The backlighting is a little dim and could be brighter but for me I find it sufficient, I don't really notice the backlighting when I am using the keyboard. For the price, I think this keyboard is a good value if you are just using it day to day to type with, it has a satisfying click and I do like the sound the keys make, your co-workers maybe not so much. The fonts used on the number switches is a little annoying as they are stylized for the alternate characters. but that is a small gripe, sometimes it just takes me an extra second to make sure I hit the correct key.",
