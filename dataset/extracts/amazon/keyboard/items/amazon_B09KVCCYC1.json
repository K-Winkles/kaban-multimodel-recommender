I decided to get a keyboard and mouse combo with USB receiver because 1) I would just need 1 USB receiver to connect both devices, saving USB port, and 2) USB receiver is much more responsive without any lag compared to Bluetooth keyboards and mice.I got this combo keyboard and mouse because of its inexpensive price and its sharp and clean look but I was surprised with the quality and feel of the keys on the keyboard. They are very quiet yet very responsive, thanks to scissors switch key design. They are low profile and looks very slick. I also like that it's a full size keyboard with number pad. The USB receiver can be found inside the battery compartment of the keyboard, which is clearly labeled outside. Keyboard needs 2 AA batteries and while mouse need 1 AA battery. You really can't go wrong with this combo set if you are in the market for new keyboard and mouse. 5 out of 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "This product is just okay. I like the size -- it is compact which works for my smaller hands. It looks sleek at first glance, and the mouse has the shape of apple products, which I like. The cons: the items are so cheaply made, they look like they could come from a dollar store, like a throw-away kid's toy. Also, while the keyboard itself is light and sleek, the buttons are super big, clunky and heavy. They seem to stick as they are pressed, and I feel like a child learning to type for the first time. It is so hard to use and I am making so many mistakes. I wanted to love it, but it is slowing my productivity time tremendously. I would only recommend buying if it's not a daily, all day use thing. I'm sure it packs well and might be a good backup product, but not for daily work use, in my opinion. Will be returning for something sturdier and easier to type on. You get what you pay for with this item.",
