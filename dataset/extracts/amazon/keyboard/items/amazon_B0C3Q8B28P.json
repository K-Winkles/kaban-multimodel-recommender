Sturdy construction, compact size, smooth matte finish, decent layout, and soft clicks make this item a good solution for any desktop. Time will tell, but impressed so far.One minor note: When the display turns off after the set time, simply moving the mouse will not turn it back on. You need to press the button just behind the scroll wheel for that to happen. Not a big deal.",

I love the 10-key numberpad that feels natural to use. I love that there is one receiver that can be connected to my two computers using the multi-connecter. I love the way the keys feel, too; they aren't too big and clunky or too flat. They aren't completely silent, but they're not loud either. I love the energy-saving feature that saves battery without having to flip the switches every time. I'm very happy with this purchase.",
