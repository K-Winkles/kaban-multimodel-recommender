It's not too big, but it's kind of heavy, which is good. The battery lasts a long time when I use it at my workbench, and it comes with extra parts that make it great for cleaning my house and car. And when it comes to cleaning my computer, it gets into all the hard-to-reach spots super easily!",

This thing is amazing! It pushes so much air and cleans great. It didn\u2019t take any time and I think my computer is the cleanest I have seen it in years! The bottom has a knob you turn and adjust the strength of the air. It fits perfectly in my hand and comes with all the extra attachments needed. It comes with a usb cable so you can recharge it. I\u2019m super pleased with how well this works and definitely recommend if you\u2019re looking for something to replace canned air for your electronics.",

It's powerful but still not small in size. I wanted a blower that was easy to carry and strong, and I finally found the HOTFIEN Air Duster.It's super portable and really easy to use. Although it is as small as the palm, the air pressure is really strong. I cleaned one desktop in 2 minutes. Besides, the battery life is long. I have cleaned 5 computers and the led is still green. I am very satisfied with this air blower.",
