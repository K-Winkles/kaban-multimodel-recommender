                "reviewText": "I've tried a few different wireless mouse and keyboard combos, lately.With one, I loved the rounded keys, but didn't like that there wasn't enough delineation between the areas of the keyboard. Also, the right shift key was cut in half, to make room for the home key. I'd go to type an exclamation point and end up at the beginning of the paragraph, which was very annoying. The mouse was really tall and clunky and it hurt my hand.With the other, I really liked the sleek, low-profile mouse, but the keyboard itself was awful! The keys were too high, too square and too sharp. It was very uncomfortable to type and it seemed like it took more effort, which is not at all what I was looking for. The keyboard was so long, that I didn't really have room for it AND the mouse on my desk pullout. It wasn't stable, either. It slid all over the place, which is fine when you want to move it, but NOT when you need it to stay in one position.With this combo, I feel that I have the best of everything. The mouse is small, flat, sleek, and very responsive. The keyboard is compact, but there is enough delineation between the sections, without the annoying overlap. I can position the keyboard in the middle of the pullout (where I really need it), and still have enough room to move my mouse. The keys are round, giving it a very graceful look and feel.Heads-up: I thought this was missing the nano receiver, because I couldn't find it. But, then I realized that it was tucked into the battery department of the keyboard.I don't know if this comes with an auto-sleep function, where the keyboard and mouse turn off, after a certain number of minutes of inactivity. To save battery, it would be good to get into the habit of manually turning the mouse and keyboard off at night, or whenever you know you'll be away from your computer for a while.I already had a wireless keyboard, from the same maker, so this is an upgrade, for me. Re: the mouse, I'm grateful that I have one less (very long and cumbersome) cord to deal with.I'm very happy with this combo, so far.",
