                "reviewText": "I was looking for a good smaller compact gaming keyboard to replace a full size, wireless, chicklet keyboard. I kept looking a various brands, reading and watching reviews on many of them. I didn't want to spend over a specific amount, because the well known brands can be almost 2 to 3x's as much. I also know you get what you pay for so buying the cheaper, unknown brands you are kinda rolling the dice on support and durability. I'm super happy to have selected the Royal Kludge brand and this keyboard is just fantastic beyond my expectations. Battery life is mindblowing, and you can always use it while plugged into the USB-C cable while it charges. It's got a nice LED battery level indicator, and so many different LED modes, it's just insane at this price point. Feedback on the keys is great, way better than a membrane one that this replaced. It's nice to have 2.4Ghz and 3 Bluetooth options for this keyboard, I highly recommend this keyboard.",

                "reviewText": "I'll just say right off the bat: in the relatively short amount of time that I've been diving into the mechanical keyboard hobby (half a year or so), I think this is the best keyboard I've used so far.Before buying the H81, I originally purchased Royal Kludge's RK61 (60%) model with the idea that I would be able to get used to not having dedicated delete, arrow, and F keys, which I realized after a while that I could not. I returned the RK61, though I was left with a very good impression, as it was the first RK board I'd ever purchased. I opted for the H81 as it's replacement, and I'm glad I did. It has done nothing but impress me thus far.First of all, the layout is perfect for me. It has the aforementioned keys I missed on the 60%, and omits all the other dedicated keys I never use (scroll lock, home, insert, etc...), though they can still be accessed through other keys + the FN key for people that want them. Both that and removing the number pad leaves it at a nice compact size of less than even a TKL keyboard. The case itself has a good heft to it, and while it is plastic, it still feels high quality. Also, though it's a preference thing, I love the fact that it has a thick bezel. I think thick bezels look a lot better than thin ones. The dust cover is also a nice touch.To be completely honest, knowing that the switches were Royal Kludge-branded, I was fully planning on replacing them with something else (the Royal Kludge switches on the RK61 I had were good, but could've been better), but as soon as I started typing I fell in love. They are completely free of scratchiness and sound absolutely heavenly thanks to them being pre-lubed. Usually factory-applied lube is not great, or at least not consistent, but in my opinion the Sky Cyan switches in this board feel and sound just as good as Gateron Yellow switches I hand-lubed. The description mentions that these switches are supposed to be like them, but I was skeptical. They definitely annihilated my expectations. The stabilizers are just as good. Buying boards in the past I've always had to re-lube the stabs, but I was pleasantly surprised that they sounded fantastic right out of the box, no rattling at all, and consistent across all of them. I am absolutely blown away at how nice this board sounds and feels at this price. It is buttery smooth and has a nice thocky sound profile. I'm sure the silicone in the bottom of the case also helps with that.Though I have replaced the keycaps that came on this board (as seen in my review photo), there is absolutely nothing wrong with the ones that come stock. They are good quality and they feel great, with the double-shot legends looking nice and sharp. I just had another set that I already planned on using before buying this board.Though I already have a keycap and switch puller, it is still nice that one is included for people that don't have one. It's also nice that a few extra switches are included.The only things I can't comment on are the bluetooth and dongle connections, I've only used it wired.Other boards that I've had in the past were good, but I always wanted something more. I think I've finally found a board that I'm completely satisfied with. I don't think you can find a better value in a keyboard for the price. Having had a Skyloong keyboard that sells for more than this one, I think the H81 is nicer. After hearing so much hype around the name Royal Kludge, and now after finally getting to try the H81 and (briefly) the RK61 out for myself, I can say I'm a fan. I'd say they definitely punch well above their respective price points. I typed out this review using this keyboard and it has been an absolute joy.Bottom line: I would definitely recommend this keyboard, especially if you want one that will sound and feel great right out of the box without having to do any modding.",

For the price I paid and ease of use I'm extremely happy SO FAR. No issues gaming in wireless at all. Battery life seems fine you can use it while it charges so makes it even less a big deal.Now onto the software. I'm on windows 11 latest drivers on everything windows are as up to date as possible. The software installs fine. Just when it launches it says no device detected. NOW this could be because the PID listed for my keyboard is different than the required PID for the software. I don't know what this is about, and customer service hasn't responded yet. Also, the software does say there is an update but fails to download it. I am located in the US so that may be the issue.You don't need the software for the keyboard to work just making a note that it doesn't work. This would be bad if there was a firmware update or something that needed to be applied to the keyboard to fix something.",

It absorbs vibration at the bottom, without softening the touch by too much. It still sounds fabulously clear like other top-notch TTC linear switches --- just with slightly reduced \"volume\" and less \"bass\", which is great if you care about your roommate/co-workers/significant other.The driver utility software is great. I can edit Fn layer and Fn2 layer easily, saving and loading the settings as .rkf files. This is on par with the high-end HHKB hybrid models that can cost $300+. For example, I don't need a numpad now, because I can map the numbers from 0 to 9 to Fn2 + B NM, HJK YUI. You can customize your own numpad. You edit it once and it will be saved to the board and used for wireless modes as well. Very cool.2.4Ghz connection is stable. I am not using it for competitive gaming so I can't comment in that regard. But it is much stabler than the iqunix l80 and cmk 87 from two years ago. I've owned several high-end models with 2-3x the price from cherry and filco. There is absolutely no comparison in terms of the typing experience and versatility. Worth every penny.",

                "reviewText": "- Nice weight to it, definitely doesn't feel cheaply made.- Switches are rather interesting, if you're fond of the standard keyboard typing sound but want it to be more muted and smoother (less clacky) if you get the drift.- Hot swapping: I can't comment on advanced modding personally (i.e. replacing switches, lubing) but swapping keycaps is a smooth experience. The keycaps it already comes with is satisfactory enough though. You don't need to worry about rough plastic edges or gritty surfaces.- Design is a must for anyone looking for a keyboard with a different look from the standard. (Retro aesthetics are personally a favourite for me). The keyboard ridge is a very light grey though, so keep that in mind if you are searching for an actual white keyboard. Personally I think it is still versatile and can compliment many other custom keycaps.- THE KNOB: this feature is one of the biggest highlight. Have to see how it holds up over time but for now I can see it being useful if you frequently switch between connection modes or multiple devices (and currently both bluetooth and wireless G work smoothly for me). I used a keyboard with a volume dial type feature before, and honestly feel it's unnecessary if you already have other appliances connected to your computer/laptop/etc where you can adjust the volume (or better yet just...lower the volume manually on the device itself).Reason I'm refraining from 5 stars is because I want to see how it holds out longevity wise. Also keep in mind this is a review by someone who isn't the most tech savvy or a keyboard modding pro (code for beginner friendly).",
