The keys are super soft to the touch and barely make a sound, and the color scheme is perfect for gamers (though you can adjust brightness or turn them off for a more traditional office setup. There are quite a few colors available, but blue one is my favorite). The ergonomic mouse has handy forward and back buttons for easy browsing (takes some getting used to, but it's really convenient!). Plus, the built-in phone holder is a great feature, making it easy to view both my monitor and phone screen at once. Another great thing is that both mouse and keyboard are rechargeable (USB cable included), so finally I do not have to care about buying batteries every now and then! On top of it, they enter sleep mode within 15 or 30 min, and also have power-off switch - which makes single charge to last for a long time.",

I like the keyboard for the use and spacing of keys. The Mouse works fine with no issues. it\u2019s too bad this doesn't work as it should as it could be a really decent product. maybe the next one will work fine. If it does work fine then I will update this, if not I will leave it the same.The new one is working as advertised. I am happy with the product. Customer support has been great. Thank you.",

                "reviewText": "I must say, I was skeptical that this would jump out of the box and connect itself to my computer, but that is exactly what it did! This was the fastest setup time I\u2019ve ever experienced. I\u2019m an Automotive Partsman at a dealership and the piece of trash equipment that I had did not work the way I wanted it to. This is why I took it upon myself to purchase my own equipment. It works so good that our Parts Manager ordered the same setup himself the next day.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this keyboard, mouse set for work as I work from home. When I received the product I fully charged both mouse and keyboard as the instructions say. The mouse works great but the keyboard backlight turns off after about 60 seconds of not using it and then it just completely stops working. The light starts flashing like it is dying even though it was just fully charged. After switching the power off and then back on it starts working again until the same thing happens. Ordered a replacement thinking the one I got was just defective but the second one I got had the exact same issue. Would not recommend unless you want to overpay for a mouse and get a useless keyboard with it.",
