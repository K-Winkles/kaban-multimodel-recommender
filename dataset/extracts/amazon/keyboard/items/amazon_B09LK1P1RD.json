This keyboard exudes quality with its heavy and premium feel, making typing a pleasure.What's truly remarkable is the battery life. With the backlight on, it lasts a full month on a single charge; turn off the backlight, and you get a whopping 10 months of usage \u2013 incredible! The USB-C connectivity is fast and reliable, and the sleek design adds a touch of sophistication to my workspace.The six lighting customizations allow me to personalize my typing experience, and key remapping is a fantastic feature for customization.However, there's a drawback \u2013 the Logi Options Plus software doesn't work on Android, limiting some features on the go. Also, my workplace restrictions prevent me from downloading the software, so I can't unlock its full potential there. But even without it, the keyboard performs excellently; you just can't customize it as extensively.In summary, the Logitech MX Keyboard is a top-tier choice, offering impressive battery life, USB-C connectivity, and customization options. It's highly recommended for productivity and style!",

The only real issue I could point out is the space bar rattle (At least with the Tactile Quiet model), The stabilizers are loose and rattle, The way to fix it is to pop the bar out, Give it a slight bend and then get key switch lube and lube the stabilizers, After that, This keyboard feels amazing, Really all the stabilizers need to be heavily lubed. But still, Its a great keyboard, Worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "I've had this keyboard for a few months and can say with confidence that it's AWESOME! If you need real tactile and auditory feedback in order to type well, this keyboard is what you've been waiting for. My typing speed was once over 100wpm and having learned on typewriters and earlier generations of PC keyboards the deep key travel and satisfying chunk-chunk-chunk of the keys was a big part of reaching those speeds. I had been deeply frustrated by newer generations of keyboards that featured less and less key travel and annoying little ticks when a key is depressed. It was like drumming your fingernails on a flat table. With so little vertical reference between the key and the key bed, my errors increased while speed decreased. The MX keyboard fixes all of that and brings back a proper typing experience. The key travel is excellent, the sound is spot on, and it's super responsive. Bluetooth connectivity is solid. My keyboard sits through a wall and just over 15ft/4.6m from the computer and it stays connected with no perceptible lag. The battery lasts a very long time, even with heavy use. My typing speed is back! Pros & cons:Pros: Excellent key travel & satisfying click sounds. Very well-built (it's heavy!), durable, and won't slide around on your desk. Keys float above the key bed instead of sitting in it, which makes it very easy to clean. Battery lasts a very long time, even with lots of backlight usage. Bluetooth connectivity is solid. No bluetooth dongle needed. Caps lock indicator seems annoying at first, but is actually really helpful!Cons: Has a slightly more compact footprint than most modern keyboards, so you'll probably spend the first week or so acclimating your fingers to landing the right place. The \"+\" key on the 10-key is double-size, like on an old adding machine, so if you 10-key a lot it'll throw you off for a while. Programmable shortcuts are pretty meager and don't include some critical ones for PC users, like Print Screen. On a Mac, any programming issues can be addressed by using Shortcuts or Keyboard Maestro. Not sure what the PC equivalents are. In an effort to make a hybrid keyboard, the placement of the command/alt, function, option/start & control keys is wonky. Once in a while the bluetooth connection will become intermittent and you have to keep hitting the keys to wake up the keyboard. This is resolved by restarting. The backlight is ambient-light sensitive, so it doesn't stay on in a brighter room. Kind of a drag if you like having a nice, bright backlight all the time (which I do).",

                "reviewText": "This keyboard is pretty amazing. I own a HHKB, and a Pok3r. I build and customize my own keyboards. I bought this mainly because of the Logitech Flow feature. But first, I wanted to talk about the keyboard itself and why I think this is the best office keyboard to date.The build quality is amazing. It's sturdy, and the internals are very tight, which means, no rattling, no added noise or reverbiation. As a result, this is a very quiet mechanical keyboard (I can only speak for the brown switch version).The keycaps are made out of recycled plastic, but they don't feel cheap. They are quite smooth and easy to type with. The typing experience is very consistent and smooth (see type test photo). My typing speed is consistent with my other keyboards, but for me, it's definitely feels much better to type with tactile silent switches compared to my other keyboards.Even though this keyboard is a low profile keyboard, there are flip up feet at the bottom of the keyboard to lift it up a little more to get a better angle if that's what you prefer.The lights are nice, but what makes this keyboard really stand out is when it doesn't use the lights at all. Without the backlights on, this keyboard can do 10 months on 1 charge, which is completely unheard of for a mechanical full size wireless keyboard. I've had this keyboard for a couple of days on the whole time, and by now, my other wireless 60% would have died and required a recharge.There is only one issue with this keyboard which is customization. For Macros, only some of the keys (F Keys and Cursor Targeting Group) can be customized vs what I am used to, which is being able to customize every single key. For customizing the physical look itself such as changing the switches or the keycaps, this keyboard cannot be customized like that. The spacebar doesn't use standard stabilizer stem widths. You can replace every key cap except for the spacebar. You also cannot change the switches unless you know some soldering which is not recommended.As for the reason why I bough the keyboard. I absolutely love it! The logitech flow option allows me to move from my multiple computer setups with only one keyboard and mouse. I often multitask, I have a computer running 24/7 as my \"smart tv\" as well as my personal laptop, and my work computer. Considering how I can flow through all those computers from one set of mouse and keyboard without having to physically switch the mouse to use that specific computer is absolutely game changing. I feel like I am using one computer, even though they are all completely seperated.Whenever a product can make someone's life easier, is when you know you have something truly revolutionary. For work and every day use, this is absolutely the best office keyboard to date.",

                "reviewText": "This keyboard is a solid little keyboard. It\u2019s very well built and has a satisfying feel and noise while typing. I really like how easy it is to switch between different computers. I have it set to use both my desktop PC and my MacBook Air when I dock it on my desk. It knows which is which and changes the keyboard layout accordingly. Everything just works. The battery life is excellent and it charges up really quickly over usb c. The Logitech Options app is really easy to use with everything laid out in such a way to just make sense. Also; the back lighting is simple but still nice.Ok onto my complaints. First I wish the key caps were a better material. They get glossy really quick from the slightly dirtiest fingers. I dunno if that\u2019s due to the dark grey colour or the material itself. But for the price it should have better key caps. Second; I wish this thing had full rgb backlighting. The white is nice; but full colour would be better. Ok that\u2019s it.So overall this is a great desktop keyboard that you could also take with you if you wanted to use your laptop or iPad on the go with it. It\u2019s great for multi device use and the typing experience is really nice!! If you\u2019re coming from the keyboard that came with your Mac or PC\u2026 or want something small and portable; this is definitely for you!",
