It is very easy to use and change colors and it comes with many different features as far as what you can do with the color modes. I don't think it comes with any software to control lighting but I myself usually keep it on a color that matches my setup and the light blue color is amazing. not to mention that this keyboard is quieter than some other red switch keyboard's I've had. It looks amazing and the color has not faded or anything and I use it heavily on a daily basis",

Not only is it super cute and an amazing price, but it is one of the few companies that I've seen say you can set custom settings and really mean it. I will say its a pretty clicky keyboard as far as red switches tend to go, but for me this is a big plus. If you are thinking of avoiding the board because you think it will be totally silent, that is not the case! Plus, for 40 bucks, you can't get a better value.",

The RGB is way better than I expected, and so is the sound. It has over 10 different RGB changing themes and you can make yourself a custom RGB theme on its app. This is just an amazing keyboard overall, worth every penny, and better than every Razer keyboards out there which cost 2-3x more. There are however a few comments that aren't happy with it because it doesn't work and so on but those are most likely just faulty ones with issues so don't get scared by those comments and buy it, i definitely recommend it.",
