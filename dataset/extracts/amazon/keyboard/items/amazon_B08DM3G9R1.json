                "reviewText": "This keyboard is a great value for the price. I previously ordered a 60% mechanical keyboard from Amazon, which I had to return because it was SO loud. Like, \"I'm worried about disturbing people in the next room over\" loud. This keyboard is not silent by any means, but is much quieter, similar to the noise level of a standard keyboard. The keys are still satisfying to press despite that. The enter key and spacebar are a little \"clickier\" than the others.The RGB looks really nice. The default setting cycles through the colors pretty quickly, and you can adjust the speed up or down depending on preference. You can also turn RGB off or change it to monochrome.The only downside to me is the positioning of some keys is a little awkward, although I imagine some of it is just adjustment to the different layout of the 60% size keyboard. The enter key is not easily reached with the pinky and I tend to hit the forward slash key when going for the quotations key. The spacebar is at a small downward slant and took some getting used to, but now feels normal. Also, when I received the keyboard the right shift key didn't work, but I took it off and put it back on (easy to do) and now it works perfectly.Overall I'm really happy with this keyboard and I would 100% recommend it for the price.",

                "reviewText": "(I am writing this review with this keyboard and not editing the results in order to showcase the problem)This would be a very solid keyboard forthe price, however, the one Ireceived has an issue where the spacebar needsto be hitwith far more force than the other keys. This results in a lot of words ending up running together or in some cases, it seems hitting itwith a bit too much force resultsin it putting two spaces between words. This is obviously a pain while typing, but that can beedited - what *can't* be edited is the obvious problem this causes when trying to use itto jump in video games.I don't have any experience with mechanical keyboards, so I don't know how itcompares, butapart from the spacebar it doesn't feel that much different from a membrane keyboard. That said, I certainly appreciate how chunky the keys are (it's especially nice to have anISO Enterkey!), and I was surprised by just how much nicer it felt to use keys with ergonomically shaped keycaps.The LEDs are not consistentlybright, with most of the number keys being dimmer than the letters. It also seems as though the emitter under the keycaps is shaped kind of like a puzzle piece, and with several keys you can see thenotches where there's no light, resulting in a kind of splotchy look. There's an \"instruction manual\" (one small piece of paper) included that tells you what you can use the Function key combos todo. Onesideis in Chinese, andtheEnglish on the other side is mostly fine, but it refersto something that was translated as \"streamer\". As far asI can tell, this refers to any light setting where the colors change or move inany way. There doesn't appear tobe a wayto make the rainbow mode stationary. I'm not particularly bothered by any of this, butif theLEDs are important for you, then I'd probably knock another staroffthe review.",
