                "reviewText": "I acquired this keyboard to replace my Logitech pop keys I had beforehand. coming from a Logitech keyboard to this has been an experience considering keycaps were harder to search for considering Logitech at its own standard when it came to certain keys. this is one of the cheaper hot swappable boards I've seen and so far it sounds and feels amazing. I have put a few different key caps sets on it but the default ones have had the best feeling and sound in my opinion. overall if you're looking for a really good mechanical keyboard on the cheap I would recommend this",

                "reviewText": "Certain keys were tied to \"hidden\" functions. The numbers keys do not work after these \"hidden function keys\" are pressed. Typing anything with a specific letter, which is part of our name, would instantly open an MSDOS looking window. Then the administrator request window. Then the computer information (ip, etc) window. Regardless of how many times we reset to factory settings. I believe it is the factory settings that programmed the keyboard to access OUR information. I am not a conspiracy theorist or paranoid OLD person. Tech is part of my professional and private life. This is highly scary! This keyboard was intended for my little girl (daughter). Thank goodness I had not connected her PC to the rest of the network or attached her other peripherals. Buyer BEWARE! Dangerous and highly suspicious!",

                "reviewText": "Looks like GTSP, aka Guffercty kred is selling the Skyloong GK84 75% board with all the features. I'm not sure what is missing, but I was not able to find the Skyloong 75% board on Amazon other than this one. It is wireless; it has the skyloong gasket, optical reds, shine-through keycaps, etc. It comes with a replacement spacebar, so you don't have to use the red one in the picture & replacement Esc key, so you don't have to use the proprietary \"stepped\" Esc key by Skyloong. It is hot-swappable. So the board normally sells for more on the official website. The software is hard to understand, but you'll have to look on YouTube for GK61 owners to show you how they configured the software. All the keys are remappable. You have 3-layers to program, but those won't have RGB, you have RGB on the \"Driver\" layer, so that is a little confusing. Basically, use the \"Driver\" layer and then reprogram the other layers with other remapped keys. The board does not come with a keyboard cover, it is wrapped in plastic in a cardboard box. Comes with a generic key and switch puller, a nice braided 6ft cord with a velcro tie attached. I don't know when it was manufactured, but probably in 2021 because the S/N ends in 21. I wish it came with a plastic dust cover like the Skyloong boards do when they come direct from the factory, but it's okay. GTSP seems like a great company, and I hope they continue to provide these boards! Thank you GTSP!",
