                "reviewText": "Update Aug 2020:\"W\" switch died after 2 1/2 years, I suspect \"Q, E, R, A, S, D, F\" are soon to follow based on the majority of my gaming. This is what I would call normal wear, no complaints here. \"W\" was the switch with the most strokes on it. Replacing the key was super easy, and they give you extra switched when you purchase the keyboard. Awesome! Total down time < 5 min.Still very satisfied after 2 & 1/2 years. Felt good enough about this keyboard to grab some new key caps & this thing really pops now. Matches my Glorious Model D \ud83d\ude0dOriginal Review:TL;DR: Buy this keyboard. If you are coming from another low/mid-end mechanical you will be very happy. If you are coming from membrane you will be ecstatic. If you are coming from a higher-end keyboard & don't pro-game this will fit the mold just find, you & your wallet will be happy.Initially I was hesitant to purchase this product with it's lack of reviews, but consider this is a relatively new product (introduced to amazon on Jan 2018) I looked to their other keyboard reviews and was pleasantly satisfied. That being said, if you are uncomfortable with the lack of review I suggest looking at the other products they make and then come back to read the (currently) 3 positive reviews on this keyboard. My review will be two parts, first the product as a stand alone item and second this product against similar items I own.Part 1Pros:Price: only $40 keyboard I can find with red switches87 key design: personal preference, but I like a full 16.5\u201d of mouse space to play fps'sLights: it's real pretty, there are 18 different pre-set LED modes with 9 different LED color options.Software: If you want more lighting options download the free software. It's free, super easy to use (easier than the Corsair software IMO) and now my keyboard looks awesomeThe switches: only red's I can find at this price range. I am not good enough at typing or video games to be an expert of this but the activation point seems to be consistent. They all seem to activate at around 40% of the entire stroke.Peripherals: comes with extra switches, two key pullers, and an easy to follow quick start guide (explains the lighting modes)Build quality: Sturdy, no flex, replaceable switchesCable routing: there are three different channels to route the cable throughAesthetics: aside from the pretty lights, many people enjoy the floating key design. I find it easier to keep clean and looking niceNeutral:The switches (yes, again): While these are nice for $40, if you are coming from Cherry MX or the like you will notice a different. They are not as \u201csnappy\u201d for lack of a better work, but still leaps and bounds over membrane, obviously.Cons:Guided keys: the space bar & shift keys are both on the mushy side. Not a deal breaker, but def noticeable when compared to the other keys that operate with no little metal guide bar.Part 2Tecware Phantom vs:-Red Dragon 87 key w/blue switchesAt roughly the same price (Tecware is $3 cheaper) I would recommend the Tecware simply due to the fact you can get it with red switches which I prefer. If you were comparing blues vs blues, it's a toss up that boils down to personal preference. The red dragon has a lot more reviews, but the initial quality of this Tecware product is very impressive. Buy whichever one you think looks cooler. UNLESS, you don't care about RGB. In that case get the Red Dragon because it cheaper without RGB.-Corsaire StrafeKeep in mind this is a $110 product to a $40 one... The Cherry MX switches in the corsaire are nice. If I didn't have the two side by side or had never touched Cherry MX I would have zero complaints about these OUTEM switches. The Corsaire has a few other features I won't really dive into it's not hard to compare specs. The biggest difference I notice is a more consistent key stroke on the Corsaire notable in the guided keys (space & shift). This can make a difference in gaming, but at the level I play it is not worth an extra $70. Bottom line I do not think my Strafe is $70 better than this Phantom. It is without a doubt nicer.-Drevo GramrI love the size of this little keyboard, but the switches/keys were bad. Noticeably worse than this Phantom. It was about 1.5-2\u201d shorter on the width which is nice, but I have a huge mouse pad and would rather have nicer switches than that extra space. If desk space is at a premium and an extra 1.5-2\u201d is going to make a difference (insert phallic joke here) then go for the tiny Gramr. Otherwise this Phantom is better in every way for a few bucks less.If your wondering why I own(d) all these keyboard...Quick background, my first mechanical keyboard was the Red Dragon 87 key. I loved it, but the blue switches were annoying my wife. Also I felt a linear switch would be a (slight) advantage in fps's. In practice I'm not getting any high K/D with red switches and am no better a CSGO player, which is disappointing. But you can learn from my mistake, nice hardware won't make you suck less. Second keyboard is a friends used Corsair Strife, and I instantly fell in love with the red switches. After hitting my thumb on the 10-key pad a few hundred times I decided to go back to 87-key, but cannot justify spending over $50 on a keyboard when my highest rank is Gold in Overwatch. I tried the Drevo Gramr mostly for work where desk space is at a premium and the minimalist design seemed practical, but couldn't get over the switch quality and the lighting scheme which never worked for me. Now I have this Phantom & love it.",

                "reviewText": "I got about 2 solid years of constant use out of my first Phantom 87 with brown switches. Still works but one of the LEDs is stuck on blue now. Decided to hand it down to my nephew who has never owned a mechanical keyboard and get a shiny new one. Got the blue switches this time around and really liking it. The keycap font has changed and the keycaps themselves are slightly textured compared to the old one. Supposedly they added more sound dampening to get rid of the slight ringing sound when typing but this new one still does. Not a big deal I'm use to it. This is in my opinion the best off brand, sub $50 mechanical keyboard on the market. Extremely well made and didn't hesitate buying a second one. On to my original review...I have owned several name brand mechanical gaming keyboards including Corsair, Kingston and Cooler Master over the years all of which have been good keyboards but quite expensive. I also own a cheap $40 E-Elements Z88 with knockoff Brown Switches. Not a bad little keyboard for the money but also not super impressed. My current daily driver is a Corsair K70 with Cherry MX Speed Switches (Linear Gray Switches). Its been my go to keyboard for about 2 years now. I wanted a more compact keyboard for my HOTAS setup to replace my Z88 and didn't want to drop a ton of money but after owning such high quality keyboards, my standards are pretty high. Did a fair bit of research and finally decide on the Tecware Phantom after reading overwhelmingly positive reviews. The hype train is usually never and good as the product so I set my expectations somewhere in the middle. Literally upon receiving the keyboard the packaging was surprisingly not just some plain cardboard box with the brand spray painted on it. It is very professional looking, glossy pics and descriptions etc. Very professional presentation. Some people look past these things but you can tell that Tecware put extra thought into first impressions. That usually says something about how proud they are of a product and I was not wrong about that here. This Keyboard is flat out impressive feeling and looking straight out of the box! Very simplistic and classy looking with a Steal top plate, Zero flex heavy ABS plastic shell and the Outemu Brown switches feel FANTASTIC! No gaudy graphics not even a Tecware logo. This thing just speaks for itself. I have a Cooler Master with Cherry MX Browns that I spent over $130 for. In comparison to be dead honest, this Techware Phantom looks more expensive. The mechanical difference being the Outema switches, have a very slightly more pronounced tactile bump. Yet still are super quiet and fluid otherwise. Absolutely the best MX knockoff switches out there IMO. This keyboard is an absolute pleasure to type on both stock and now with the O-Ring Dampeners I added yesterday. If you're not familiar, for less then $10 you can get a bag of mechanical keycap O-Ring Dampeners. They go on the underside of the key cap stem and essentially don't allow the keys to completely bottom out. Which gets rid of the extra click sound and quickens up the key travel. Its a super easy mod for cheap and works excellent on these Outemu Brown Switches. I have my Corsair K70 and my Cooler Master sitting off to the side as I write this review with the Phantom. Don't miss them at all.Pros- (There are a LOT of them)-Quality Packaging-Steal (not aluminum) top plate-Thick ABS plastic shell (No flex)-Medium/heavy overall, won't slide-Floating key design for easy keyboard cleaning-Double injected key caps-Individual per-key REAL full RGB lighting-Vibrant and accurate RGB lighting that can be turned off-RGB and Macro programming software from Tecware's website (very few budget keyboards get software support)-Hot Swap-able Outemu switches (Keyboard comes with 4 extras, key cap puller and switch puller-Braided and gold plated USB Cable- ITS ONLY $45 !!!!!!!!!!!!Cons-In fairness I will be nitpicking here..-Font on stock keys is a little small for my taste. I have replaced a few of them with Corsair gaming keys which I like better.-Non-detectable cable-No wrist rest includedConclusion:The simple answer is OMG yes! BUY THIS KEYBOARD! Amazon is flooded with cheap Chinese mechanical keyboards. Some good, some not so good. This one is BY FAR top of the food chain in that category. Its less then 1/2 the cost of name brand keyboards with like features, some if which I own. The Phantom easily rivals them all in build quality and feel. Best bang for the buck purchase I've made in a long time.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using this for a few months now at work. After changing out the keycaps and the switches (gateron clear) I'm in love with this board.Pros: it's got WEIGHT. ITS SOLID. Mind blowing in a super budget mechanical board. It has standard 3 pin hot swap switches. Switches are relatively easy to remove with a switch puller. Lighting is great and has lot of variety built in, and easy Fn key switching.Cons: only 2. Putting in switches other than the stock Outemu... Not sure if it's just a me thing, but some of the switch spots are really really hard to get a switch into. I replaced the switches in the main section and the arrow keys, ignoring the rarely ever used function and insert row, and I busted the pin on 13 gateron switches trying to replace them. Also have this weird bug where I've lost the RGB on most of the presets... Except for the first one that just slowly goes through the rainbow on the whole board at once. It just lets me do either white, or a pale pink for every other RGB preset. I have a full size of this same board at home, and no RGB issues on any of the presets. Think it might just be a software glitch on my particular board then.",

                "reviewTitle": "One The Best For New Enthusiasts (Pink And Orange Switches)",
                "reviewText": "This keyboard is one the best for people new for people who are new in custom keyboards. The orange switch is my favorite, as it gives a nice tactile bump that confirms a keypress, that some linear switches lack. However the pink switches are also nothing to scoff at. They feel just as good, and amazingly smooth at that, and the force needed to press down on the key is very consistent. The switches and stabilizers are also pre-lubed which is very convenient, and saves times for people who don't want to go through the process of lubing, makes the keyboard feel 10 times better than a normal one. The amount of filler in the keyboard too at this price is amazing as well.Although this keyboard is awesome, and I highly recommend it. There are some drawbacks that you should be aware of. Firstly, the hotswap PCB of the keyboard is only 3 pin. Meaning if you buy different switches to put in this keyboard your going to have to trim them to make it fit. The RGB lighting is also something to note. Since the keyboard is hotswap, the RGB wont be as bright as a lot of gaming keyboards. And the software for the keyboard is isn't as expansive as other brands, but is does other macro recording, profiles, per-key LED customization, and adjustable response rate.Overall this keyboard is amazing for the money you pay for it, and I highly recommend it for first time enthusiasts. The physical experience after using this keyboard is incredible, and you will probably not be able to comfortably go back to non-lubed keyboard after using this one",

                "reviewText": "Yo compr\u00e9 este teclado con el fin de personalizarlo gracias a qu\u00e9 es hot swap, por lo que no puedo hablar del tacto de los switches, pero hay que recalcar que es un producto de mucha calidad, el pcb ya tiene foam para silenciar el teclado, y el software es suficientemente bueno, a diferencia de otros softwares como icue, el teclado si guarda el perfil de rgb, por lo que aunque lo desconectes vuelve a tener la misma configuraci\u00f3n que ten\u00eda antes, creo que tiene incluso m\u00e1s calidad que los teclados de razer (quitando los switches y las keycaps), trae algunos repuestos de switch, quita teclas y saca switches por lo que si te acabas alg\u00fan switch lo puedes cambiar f\u00e1cilmente, y no necesitas comprar todo eso por separado o usar otros m\u00e9todos para quitar switches y teclas. En lo personal creo que es de las mejores compras que he hecho este a\u00f1o respecto a perifericos gamer",

No need to do any custom changes or settings for daily use.Only 1 problem that I met was, sometimes when I clicked on any key, it might no input or input twice. This happened quite often in the first week I purchased. Maybe just I first time use mechanical keyboard. After 1.5 months use, it still happen 0-2 times a week for daily 8 hours usage. Not affect too much so it is still very good keyboard for me.",
