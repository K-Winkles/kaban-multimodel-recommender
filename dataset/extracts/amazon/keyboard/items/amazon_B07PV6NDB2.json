                "reviewText": "I love this keyboard (and this sort of keyboard in general) because of various reasons.Firstly, ergonomics and design. I work and play from my computer at home, and while I've had larger, bulkier keyboards, I feel like these smaller and lighter ones are far better to alleviate the effects of the repeated movement on my fingers and wrist. It is also quiet, easy to move, and small, so it barely takes up any space in my desk. It does not sacrifice the numeric keypad on the right, which is important to me.Secondly, battery life. I have an easy-to-access cable on my desk, but I don't have to recharge it often. The fact that it goes into sleep mode means I don't have to be turning it off nightly.Thirdly, easy to clean. Other keyboards can often get dust and lint underneath the keys; with this sort of keyboard, a simple dusting now and then suffices.This one has an additional feature which seems very handy, though I won't be using it often, which is the ability to connect to a different device with the touch of a button. Overall, highly recommended and worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "Update: Nov. 17th, 2020I've had this keyboard for more than 30 days and struggled with it quite a bit. The lack of tactile feedback was difficult to get used to. To \"correct\" that I installed a keyboard clicking app for my Ubuntu Linux 20.04 workstation that this keyboard is connected to. Hearing the \"clicking\" feedback from my speakers helped more than I thought it would and I actually began enjoying using this keyboard. My fingers \"stopped tripping over themselves\" and all in all, I'd say it's been a pleasant experience with this keyboard.And then ... the battery stopped charging. No matter what I did, the battery refused to charge. I'd plug it in for a few hours, the battery meter would read 100% and then drop to 10% when I unplugged the keyboard. I was three days past the return date of the keyboard when it happened, so I contacted iClever support. They responded in less than 12 hours and successfully remediated the issue to make me happy. I have to say, their response and support in my case was world-class. I'm disappointed that the keyboard failed as I was finally beginning to enjoy using it and with that said --- I'm going to give it another try and purchase another. I very much appreciate their Customer Service and am happy to give their product another chance as a result. I like to support companies with excellent customer service and iClever's support is awesome. Nice job!!Original Review:I bought this keyboard to replace an Apple Magic Keyboard (Aluminum, bluetooth model) because a few keys broke on it due to wear and tear and finding replacement keys was very problematic. Placed multiple orders with multiple vendors only to be told after the fact parts were backordered because of the tarrif's and such with China.So I opted to buy this keyboard instead and hey why not, it was actually cheaper than replacing the keys on my Apple Bluetooth keyboard.Aesthetically, this is a very pleasing keyboard. It matches my blacked out workstation and I like the fact it's laid out like a 101k keyboard with the number pad off to the right. It's a sturdy keyboard, there is no \"flex\" when I type on it and it appears to be very well thought through and constructed. 10/10 for that.Getting it to connect to my Bluetooth 4.x on my Ubuntu Linux workstation presented a few issues to overcome.First was that it wasn't visible to my bluetooth. It seemed to take a very long time to be discoverable. Minutes and minutes long. Once found, I connected they keyboard via the first channel. Nothing happened until after another lengthy delay it started repeating the \"d\" character despite my not touching the keyboard. I had to turn the keyboard off to make it stop repeating \"d\" and then removed the keyboard from the list of bluetooth devices in Ubuntu.I repeated the setup instructions documented and the same thing happened. Examining the keyboard the \"d\" key appeared fine and didn't appear stuck, so I tried pairing the keyboard with my Ubuntu workstation again, this time on the second channel. It worked. No repeating \"d\" character, the keyboard functioned as normal.For giggles I removed the keyboard from my bluetooth devices and again followed the instructions to connect on the first channel, only to see the \"d\" key repeating itself again. Dropped the bluetooth connection to the keyboard, re-setup on channel 2 and it's working like a champ. Not sure what's wrong with the first channel, it's definitely kaput. That doesn't matter to me, I'm only connecting this keyboard to one device so that's a non-issue for me and not something I'd return the keyboard for.My last comments are specific to the action in the keys and the feedback they provide while typing. I typically clock anywhere from 95 - 110 wpm on every keyboard I own, whether it's an old IBM CLICKY keyboard (my favorite) an old Logitech K570 and my beloved Apple Wireless bluetooth keyboard. I'm used to the response action on all these keyboards and can switch pretty seamlessly.On this keyboard the action is lacking. The response from the time I press a key to it reverting back to it's resting state seems lacking to me. I expected the action to be similar to that of my Apple wireless bluetooth keyboard. It's not. If that's what you're expecting with this keyboard, do not buy it.The last thing I want to say is that the lack of keyboard \"action\" for me inhibits how quickly I can type on it. I've found my fingers \"tripping over themselves\" trying to type on it. That means more mistakes and backing up to correct. As I typed this review, I switched back and forth between my Apple bluetooth keyboard and this one. The difference in the keyboard action and my ability to type so much faster on my Apple keyboard vs. this one is absolutely noticeable. I'm going to give myself a little more time to get used to this keyboard and if that doesn't do the trick then I'll be sending it back. The \"dealbreaker\" for me isn't the bad bluetooth channel it has, it's the keyboard action and not being able to go as fast as I can on my Apple bluetooth keyboard which has a similar layout and key spacing (I measured the gaps between the keys on both keyboards, they're identical.)About me: I've been in the Information Technology field for 35 years. Yep, I'm an old fart. I write reviews for products I buy because I like to share what I find, both good and bad. I also read others reviews before I purchase a product and rely on the truthfulness of those reviews. If you found my review helpful, please indicate such. Thanks for reading.",

                "reviewText": "The keyboard was purchased for the SMARTS TV and PCs. I have so may other smaller keyboards in the past, but this one beats the other ones by far. HOWEVER, there are caveats that you have to worry about.Pros:Keyboard is wide enough to accommodate kids (from around 8 years) to adults. It's not really a full-size keyboard, but large enough to make things a bit comfortable to type with when you're sitting down away from the TVIt synchs to three different devices and you can switch very quickly between the devices using the available 3-synch functions.It comes with a keyboard film to prevent nasty greasy hands from making the keyboard feel disgusting, and dirt from getting in-between the keys.Keys are very bouncy. LOVE IT! Just the right tactlessness.Numerical and function keys to match with various OSes, and the numerical pads on the side is a massive plus for number entry freaks like myself.Each charge ranges between 82 hours of continuous usages (yep, 82+ hours of continual usages) to 100+ hours of on-and-off usages. 90 hours is the average I assume.Now, the conditions. This is a BT 5.0/5.1. You use it on a 4.0/4.1, good luck. Your chance of connection is slim to none. I have various laptops, PCs, mobile devices with BT 4.0 and 5.0. The ones with 4.0 will have a hard time connecting, but the ones with 5.0, no issue whatsoever. Fast, responsive, and awesome connection when I need it. It may go to sleep from time to time as a power saving method, but the keyboard will connect to device within a second for typing. There's a momentary lag to wake up the connection within that half second or so, but full connection and responsiveness thereafter.Cons:The design of the keyboard and film don't allow proper stick on. Move the keyboard to the side a bit, and the protective film comes flying off. The film is not large enough to use an adhesive to hold the protective film down securely. Using tape to hold the protective film down looks a bit clunky and unprofessional.As mentioned earlier, better use the USB BT 5.0/5.1 dongles, or devices with built in BT 5.0 or better. Otherwise, a connection to the keyboard will be a 50/50 chance.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:> Has full keys, yet portable since avoiding keys between alphabets and numpad> Looks beautiful, sturdy, and is lightweight. Will not move while typing.> No delay between typing and appearing in screen. Since 2.4 Ghz adpter, it will outperform bluetooth keyboards.> Provided a protection sheet, which protects from dirt and water. It will not move even we type very fast> Has function lock (Fn + Esc). This will help to switch between shortcut keys and function keys. This is a life saver if we use for work from home and debugging code. This is not available in most of the portable keyboards.> Working perfectly fine with Android phone & tablet. Use the given type A to C adaptor for connecting wireless receiver to phone.> Has all enough indicator lights - capslock, numlock, Fn lock, and chargingCons:Nothing found as a drawback. One thing noticed is, if we use protection sheet (rubber) and typing very fast (80+ wpm), we feel some restriction to move fingers. But that is absolutely fine & expected and can't list as a drawback! Also, the charging port is micro USB, not type C. That is also can't be listed as a drawback since micro USB cable is given and we can connect it to our existing charger.This keyboard will be best if you need a portable, yet full keyboard for working and for general purpose. Use with Android devices, but quick switching is not needed. Need to use function keys without constantly pressing down 'Fn' keys (this is the case for most quick-switch blootooth keyboards).In brief - light weight, beautiful, full functioning, perfect keyboard!",
