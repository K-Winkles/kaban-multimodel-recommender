                "reviewText": "The keyboard is lightweight overall and I would consider the mouse to be medium-sized with options to customize the two buttons on the side. The keyboard has adjustable feet if you want to tilt it. The keys have a soft feel and are relatively quiet. It's also a classic size (not compact) so if you are more of an old-school typist you will love it. And the separate number keypad is ideal.Set up was super easy!! Plugged the dongle in and everything worked. Both are very responsive, especially the mouse.Battery life is LONG! I have had mine for almost a year, working 10-hour days and I haven't changed the batteries yet!Overall, it's an affordable and reliable combo!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this keyboard about 7 months ago. It worked well earlier and then I started having error when I tried to log on. I realized that the keys on the keyboard are no longer responding correctly. Sometimes I have to type so hard just to get it to register the letters. This was not supposed to hard to type on. So, the keyboard is not a good bargain. I had to quickly buy a Logitech replacement.Update: The seller reached out to me and expressed their willingness to replace the item as it is covered under warranty. As I mentioned, I have enjoyed the keyboard until it gave me problem. Seller explained their 12months warranty on their product and their willingness to exchange the product or issue a refund. Since I had hastily purchased another keyboard, I could not request for a replacement (my error), so I opted for a refund. I think this seller is worth giving a try. They explained their plan to review reason for the defect and to take necessary steps to correct it. I am changing my overall rating from 2 stars to 4 stars, because I did not give the seller the opportunity to remedy a defective product before submitting my review. I did not know the warranty on the product was still valid. So, you should feel safe to buy this product because the seller stands behind the integrity of their product.",

I turn it off when I leave the room to save battery life.2. The 1.5v alkaline battery life is about 3 hours. I learned from research, the following cause short battery life: 1. Recharsble batteries are not strong enough for a wireless mouse. 2. Having the mouse too close to other wireless devices - the keyboard is wireless and does not operate until activated by the mouse. I need my cell phone near my desk to receive second authentications as necessary and it is my primary phone. 3. Mouse in the same area as router. This is my den. Of course, the router is in the den. 4. Using the mouse on a dark surface. My desk is brown. I'm trying different white surfaces, but the mouse drags. I'm considering returning this wireless duo, and adding 2 more cords back in my life.",
