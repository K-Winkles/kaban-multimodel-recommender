Will the distance between the keyboard itself or the keycaps be very large? The size of the keyboard is the same as that of an ordinary keyboard, and the distance between the keycaps is evenly distributed. When you change to a brand-new keyboard, you need to get used to it slowly. Can this keyboard read clearly when using it at night? Yes, if you turn on the backlight in a dark room, you can still see the font clearly and type easily, and you can adjust the brightness to the brightness you think is appropriate. How long can the keyboard light last, and will it turn off when not in use? If you want to turn off the backlight , you need to turn off the computer, put the computer to sleep, or press FN+PrtSc on the keyboard to choose to turn off the light. How big are the keyboard fonts? The keyboard is about four times larger than normal fonts.",

But alas... after several years, it finally gave out. Several of the keys ceased to function, the letters on the keys wore out and it was time to replace it. I was skeptical of this keyboard because it was priced so low but thought I'd take the chance. I WAS AMAZED! This keyboard has the big letters on it and bonus... IT LIGHTS UP! You can choose the backlight color, it's bright enough to see at night but not too bright and it's comfortable to use! I applied some clear nail polish to the keys to keep the letters from wearing out (I did the same to my old keyboard and it kept the letters fresh for several years, hoping for the same here) and here I am, typing this review on my new, lighted keyboard!",

I don't need backlit keys to work, but the backlight is easy on the eyes and the ability to change colors makes this the best keyboard you could ever want. I prefer to pick one color that looks soothing and keep it, which is a function that this keyboard supports with a couple quick keystrokes.",

                "reviewText": "If your eyesight requires large type and you don't mind having to set the keyboard options each time you restart your computer, this might be a keyboard for you. The large-print keys are good for those with some vision impairment, but the keys themselves seem slightly larger and might take you some time to get used to. There are numerous backlight colors and the brightness options are good. The key functionality is solid and responsive.The keyboard is plug-and-play and you can begin typing as soon as it's plugged into your computer and is recognized by your operating system. I encountered a minor problem and reached out to Sablute Customer support. I was extremely happy with the responsiveness and assistance the Sablute Customer Support Team provided me. We don't often experience that with online retailers.In the end, I give this keyboard a four-star rating. The keyboard function is strong and the backlighting options are numerous. Keeping in mind that the keyboard is really good, the Sablute Customer Support is what really pushed my rating to four stars. I'll look to other Sablute offerings in the future if for no other reason than the top-notch customer support.",

The capital letters oddly slow me down since I'm used to the small letters.Otherwise, it works fine.",

The keys are easy for me to read from standing or sitting, with my eyes what they are these days, and the backlights make working after dark SO much easier. I like the shallow carry keys too. You can set the lights to white, a bunch of different solid colors, or it will cycle through the colors. Keep the instructions for how to do that though. It's not an intuitive set of hot keys or arrows so you'll want the instructions around for a little while. Totally worth the money. :)",

I still like the easy to read, BOLD character keys and the backlighting. I do find that I prefer the concave keys of other keyboards to the flat keys on this one. Your fingers find the center of each key better when the keys are scooped a bit. Other than that, no other complaints. Happy with the purchase.",
