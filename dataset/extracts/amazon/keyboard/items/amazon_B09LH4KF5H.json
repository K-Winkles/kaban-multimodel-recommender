                "reviewText": "I do a lot of work at night in a relatively dimly lit home office and although I am a reasonably experienced keyboarder (formally known as a typist), I still need to search for the seldom used keys and symbols. I was looking on Amazon for a keyboard with more legible nomenclature when I ran across this one that not only had larger nomenclature but was also backlit. I had used wireless keyboards for years, but having a wired unit is not a problem with a stationary desk computer. I fell in love with this keyboard out of the box. It is full sized and has a nice feel, is relatively quiet and has almost every feature I have ever seen on any keyboard. The frosting on the cake, however, is the adjustable backlighting which makes it totally functional in a completely dark room. A great feature of the backlighted keys is that the nomenclature is molded into each key and will never wear off as with screen printed keys.I now have 2 of these keyboards because as soon as my wife saw it, she had to have one as well. I think that backlighted keyboards are sort of like heated seats and steering wheels in cars in that they seem like a gimmick at first, but once you use them you will never get a new car without them.",

                "reviewText": "The backlit keys are nice. The backlight is very bright and the large print is really easy to see. The keys are tall, maybe to allow for the light to be seen from the sides and below better, but that makes them kind of hard to use. The description indicated it was a 'quiet type' keyboard. I would NOT consider these keys to be quiet AT ALL - I'm really disappointed about that and am considering sending it back because of this. Overall if you're more focused on the large lettering/font and having well-lit, easy to see keys, then this is a good keyboard. If those things aren't as important for you, and having a quiet typing board is more important, I'd look at something else.",

I do a ton of editing, so I need to be able to often fly through projects. The backspace gets abused by me but this one can take it. Anyway, you can't go wrong. Worth every penny. Thanks so much.",

                "reviewText": "I gave this to my 86yr old father for Christmas. He just opened it this morning. I was very disappointed to find it is missing a key! We hooked it up, and it works, he is able to read the keyboard much easier because of the enlarged font and the back lighting. But the missing key is so obvious! We double checked the packaging, but the key is just not there. Very disappointing!Update: After writing my review I was contacted by the seller who responded quickly to my complaint. They were very helpful and offered to send what I assumed would be the missing key for the keyboard. Today, I received a new keyboard! I'm changing my review to 5 stars. First, my dad has been using the original keyboard and it has helped him so much, he has MD and seeing his keyboard has been a real challenge. This has made it much easier! Second, this seller went beyond what was necessary to make my purchase right. I'm impressed with their service. Thank you so much for making Dad's life a little bit easier!",
