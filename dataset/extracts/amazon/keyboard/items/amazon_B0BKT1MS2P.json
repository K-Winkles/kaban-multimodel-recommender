My only complaints are that there isn't a storage place for the USB connecter for bluetooth and the tilt of the keyboard is not adjustable. Small things, but still a great keyboard for an unbeatable price!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this keyboard because I wanted something more like a laptop keyboard, with the super-flat keys and heftier feel. This keyboard delivers all that--it's a beautiful piece of equipment. It's solid, beautifully engineered and feels well made. The typing action is easy and crisp. That being said, I did have a few issues.I have a brand-new laptop--all software new, everything updated. I wanted to be able to pair the keyboard through the 2.4G link. Nothing I did seemed to connect. At some point, it did start to work, but the performance was so terrible it was unusable--there were more sticking/repeating and dropped letters than correct ones. Troubleshooting sent me back to square one--it simply would not connect through 2.4G. I even tried seeing if the keyboard was visible in the wireless device list--nope. I was beyond disappointed that this amazing, near-perfect keyboard turned out to be utterly useless. Out of desperation, I tried one of the BT connections. It popped right up and asked if I wanted to connect, and I was off and running. The keyboard was as wonderful to use as I hoped it would be. I still wanted to get it working properly through 2.4G though. I kept trying, and still nothing. Not even the weird results I had the one time.Other than the simple troubleshooting through Amazon, I found no option for much in the way of contact or support on the Ausdom website. I used the the \"Ask the seller a question\" option and gave a detailed description of the problem and asked for help. It's been the better part of a week and I've heard nothing.I love the keyboard, and will continue to use it with the BT connection. I would have given it 5 stars, but due to the continuing issue with the 2.4G pairing and the lack of any seller response, I only gave it 4. I still hope to hear from the seller and get it working properly. If anything changes, I'll edit my rating.",

                "reviewText": "Hi, just received this keyboard. There's something great about nice low profile keys, they allow user to type so much faster. This Ausdom keyboard is slick, high quality, worth the price. It doesn't slide as I type, looks so nice on my desk, not big and bulky. It's the perfect size, super easy to set up. I knew it was going to be a nice product when I saw the packaging. It comes in an impressive box with silver foil embossed logo printed on top a nice opaque sleeve when you open the box. You know that a company cares when they put money and thought behind their packaging. I hope you enjoy the photos. some of them are blurry, because I took them quickly, anxious to write my review. I never thought I could buy a keyboard online without trying it first, but this proves that you can do. It has the quality and feel of a product that will last a long time. I use it with my laptop, because I like to have my laptop on a second level on my desk, so I'm not tipping my head down all the time. I hope all my photos showed the quality. Thanks Ausdom for a great product! I'm a first time buyer!",

Now I dont know 100% if it was the battery or the connection that would cause this but IT was terribly frustrating.

I was annoyed a little with its sometiumes difficulty connecting with the laptop bluetooth but if you were patient for a little while it would eventually get connected. Battery life seems fine and it certainly is lightweight. My only disappointments were minor such as it tends to warp so that while typing it clackity-clacks if it's not flat. But it's overall a pretty good value for the money. Unfortunately, I came home today to find that the power button would not operate - it is stuck in the off position and will not power up. Now it's a useless hunk of plastic and springs. My return window closed a month ago. Alas. I will contact the manufacturer and see if they will voluntarily send me a replacement.UPDATE: THE SELLER OFFERED TO SEND ME A NEW ONE OR TO REFUND, MY OPTION. EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE VERY RESPONSIVE. Upgrading from three stars to five.",
