                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars This keyboard is really amazing!",
                "reviewText": "This is my first keyboard above $30. I went to my local Micro Center and tested every keyboard they had looking for one that felt nice, and the nice clicky ones tended to be very expensive and relatively noisy. This keyboard captures most of the feel of typing on those keyboards, but is quiet and much cheaper.The backlighting is blindingly bright, the color transitions on the flow mode are smooth and pretty, the lighting is even, and the colors are vibrant. I like that I can set it to plain white if I want. I always use it on the lower of the two keyboard brightness settings, and that's still too bright in a dim to medium lit room.The keys all work, they feel consistent and smooth, and it's comfortable to type on. I do think a wrist rest might be needed though. I don't think the keycaps will wear over time, which is good because while they're removable, they don't take standard keycaps and replacing them would likely be difficult.The keyboard frame is surprisingly dense and heavy. It is made out of a very sturdy plastic that feels solid, has no flex/creaking and sits evenly on my desk.Other pros: Number pad and dedicated media keys are great. The media keys don't feel as nice to press as the normal keys, and they aren't backlit, but they do work well and aren't too difficult to locate without looking.The cons:-Media keys are not backlit. This really bugs me for some reason, I want all the keys to be backlit and it bothers me that some are and some aren't.-The keyboard height is a little too tall and I think a wrist rest is probably needed for comfort for most people.-Numlock light is bright white and there's no way to leave numlock on and turn off the light. This is particular to my use, since I always leave Numlock on. I'll cover it with a sticker or something.-it's got liquid drainage holes and would probably survive a spill, but my keys are particularly hard to get off and removing them and cleaning underneath would be probably take an hour or more.Overall, I do strongly recommend this keyboard. Other keyboards have per-key backlighting or Cherry MX keys or whatever but this one is good at the stuff a keyboard is supposed to do for the price. Most importantly, compared to the other similarly priced keyboards at Micro Center, these keys felt the nicest to type on- not wobbly or mushy.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Looks Perfect! Could not be any happier!",
                "reviewText": "I had to take a break from my job to write this because I am just so impressed. I am NOT being compensated by anyone for writing this.Short Version: It's well built, heavy, and the keystrokes are very smooth. The keys are quiet, not silent, and are lit up very nicely. It has greatly exceeded my expectations, and I will be actively recommending this to my family and friends.Long Version: So I've only used this keyboard for about an hour and, unless it suffers some type of catastrophic failure, this will be the only brand of keyboard I buy ever again. Immediately after picking this package up off of my doorstep I could tell this was a heavy, well-built unit, unlike my previous keyboard.Tangent! My last keyboard was purchased from another online retailer that maybe more specializes in computers and Black November sales. I was used to the standard stock keyboards I could get for $5-10, and that was fine. I decided to make the plunge into gaming keyboards, but quickly realized lots of them do not get good reviews or look any different than a cheap keyboard with lights behind it. I didn't want some cheaply made unit, so I tried to spend a tiny bit more for a nice one. However the one I paid for was very lightweight, cheaply made, and wobbly. I am in the process of returning it. I'm also currently arguing that this was defective as well. Hopefully I can avoid the restocking fee, but even if I can't I am so happy I made the choice to come to the more trustworthy Amazon to find a better unit.Ok, got that off my chest. This unit is so sturdy, so smooth, so bright, so...I am so relieved I have found a good keyboard. There are different lighting modes that make the keyboard fun to use, but most of all, it seems very functionally sound. I paid $40 for this, and if I knew how much better it would be than my previous keyboards, I would've paid more.Now there could certainly be better keyboards on the market. They better be at the prices some companies charge. For the price though, this was an excellent deal. You will not be disappointed in this purchase, especially if you have previously dealt with the cheaply made light up keyboards.Is this a perfect unit? Maybe actually, but a couple things are intially making me rate this a mere 99/100. At first glance I wasn't sure why the keys had their \"shift alternatives\" right next to the regular output. The semicolon/colon key and the apostrophe/quote key look a little confusing at first glance. Not a big issue, but it does seem weird. The other thing I noticed was that the keys are higher up than my previous, flatter keyboard, perhaps due to the heft of the unit. I don't think this is a major problem, but the wrist pad I'm expecting to arrive tomorrow may end up being a great complement to this keyboard.If any of my thoughts change, I will update this review. For now though, HyperX is going to be the first place I go to when I need new PC components.",

                "reviewText": "As a membrane keyboard, this one is not silent, but it is easy to press the keys and it's not overly noisy. It's a little bit too tall, but I fixed this with a wrist cushion. The brightness can be adjusted easily and the color options, while minimal, are pleasant. It's heavy and stays in place on my desk, helping me avoid accidental keyboard shifting. It's a bit to get used to after the flatness of a laptop keyboard, but I like how distinct each key is. The wrapped cord is also sturdy. I use it for both work and gaming, and it functions well in both circumstances.",

The keys are much quieter than a standard keyboard. Color is bright. Keys are sometimes delayed when using to game {jumping using the keys have to be repeated } you can feel and see delay. The legs could use a boost up a bit to give better comfort . But rated 4/5 stars . Price , convenience , looks and plug & play.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this as a replacement for my Cooler Master CM Storm backlit keyboard which was working perfectly but had one glaring issue. As I use a 4 port KVM switch that uses the Scroll Lock button to change computer ports.. it was affecting the operation of the backlight of the keyboard turning off, then when turning the keyboard backlight on again by pressing scroll Lock I would lose the ability to scroll in programs like Excel using the arrow keys.The situation could not be worked around.So after reading all the reviews of multiple RGB keyboards, I settled on this hyper x keyboard as it has a dedicated backlight button. And it works perfectly, leaving the scroll Lock free for port switching.As to the keyboard itself, build quality is great! Keys are softer and quieter than my previous keyboard. I was hoping for it to be almost silent but it still has a bit of clicking and clacking.The RGB lighting is a really nice touch, 2 levels of brightness and about 7 presets of lighting and 7 colors to choose from.This keyboard was great value for money and I'm glad I pulled the trigger on this. Fixed my issue and it looks great doing it!Would recommend.",

Typing is smooth and while gaming also it feels nice. Very low key click noise when typing although good for my taste and better than any dell, Lenovo or HP keyboards i have used untill now. A bit heavy as well with solid built and 2 year warranty. Overall good experience and better buying this one than cheap Ant esport or any other keyboard below 2k, since the keys go bad within 1 year.
