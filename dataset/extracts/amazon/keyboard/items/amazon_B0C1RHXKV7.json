I tried its wired mode and wireless mode on both PC and Mac without reading the user manual.I love this new keyboard for its color and theme. It adds a lot vibrancy to my boring looking WFH set up. I usually don\u2019t look at the keyboard while typing but I now look at the keyboard because I love the grayish blue color and the lighted background which changes colors.The keyboard is in a compact size but not light, it is solid with a metal positioning plate and 4 raised silicon bars under it for stability. I\u2019m not a gamer, I am coder who sits with this keyboard for at least 10 hours a day. I have been with this keyboard for about 1.5 weeks now and I find the keystrokes very steady. The keyboard is strong enough to handle my fast-paced typing without a single keystroke of delayed response.I wish there were arrow keys and a delete key so I could use my keyboard shortcuts. You can customize these keys with downloadable software, but I\u2019m not allowed to download this software on my work computer.",
