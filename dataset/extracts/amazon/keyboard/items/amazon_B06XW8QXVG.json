I do appreciate the LARGE printing on the keys and the gray-dimed white light. I have not found the keys 'sharp' at the edges nor the typing experince unbearable.Touch typing is not a chore and keys are not overly loud. I recommend this product for those looking to have a baclit wired keyboard. It does not have 'legs' to pull out so to type on an angle - it is a low profile.I suppose you could put it on something to make it more ergonomic. I do recommend it as of today.Hopefully I can avoid the many issues others have faced- we'll see !",

The keys have a satisfying punch to them, the lights are easy to turn on and off with the Scroll Lock key. The size is right, with full sized keys but less bezel and key gap.There is another version similar in size to this one, but with smaller multi-function F keys and media control; omitting all that lets the F keys stay the same size as the rest.I would recommend this keyboard for the quality and feel, but at this price it's a shoo+in.",

                "reviewText": "This may sound like a negative review, and it kinda is, but let me put this in perspective: I used one of these keyboards for two years straight, and when I finally spilled soda on it and accidentally destroyed it, I bought another one just like it. To put it another way, I definitely recommend this keyboard if you're on a tight budget like I am.Just make sure you're aware of what you're getting. This thing works perfectly fine, and it lights up so you can see it in the dark. But that's really where the pros end and the cons begin.And the cons are these: This thing is horribly ugly. I know that seems like a picky criticism, but when you have to spend many hours every day intimately with it, the ugliness can really start to get to you. It has a really shoddy paint job which is just an absolute eyesore.Also, the paint WILL come off, after regular use. It's not a nightmare like some cheap keyboards I've seen, but it's definitely noticeable. You should still be able to read the keys though.Finally, this thing is WAY too bright. As you can see in the pictures, it's not just the text that lights up but the sides of the keys as well.All that being said, I did own one of these for two years and used it every day. The keys feel fine---nothing great but not bad either. I'm a fairly fast typist too, so no worries there.If you can afford one of those costly Logitech illuminated keyboards which are non-painted, then I highly recommend you get one of those instead. But boy are they costly! So, again, if you're on a tight budget like I am but still need something that lights up, this will do in a pinch.",

La iluminaci\u00f3n no resulta en absoluto molesta, incluso en plena obscuridad.Se puede apagar con la tecla Scroll Lock que adem\u00e1s sigue reteniendo su funcionalidad normal.El dise\u00f1o de botones tipo \u00abchiclet\u00bb de pl\u00e1stico duro facilita la limpieza del polvo.Una vez uno se acostumbra, resulta irresistible teclear y escribir. \u00a1Una maravilla!Hasta aqu\u00ed todo bien. Sin embargo lo que resulta incomprensible es la pol\u00edtica de precios de Amazon.Yo he comprado la versi\u00f3n ANSI (con layout US English). Amazon lo vende por 43,74 euros. El mismo teclado en versiones alemana, espa\u00f1ola, etc. lo vende por 25 euros.\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1 Un 75 % mas caro!!!\u00bfPor qu\u00e9?Los teclados est\u00e1n fabricados en China, tanto las versiones \u00abeuropeas\u00bb como las americanas. La empresa dise\u00f1adora y comercializadora, \u2014Perixx\u2014 es alemana y los teclados se env\u00edan DESDE ALEMANIA.\u00bfA qu\u00e9 se debe ese sobre-precio exagerado? \u00bfUn arancel cultural? \u00bf ! ? ...Lo m\u00e1s incre\u00edble es que la tienda online de Perixx vende la versi\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola por 25 euros, la versi\u00f3n americana por 24 euros y la versi\u00f3n alemana por 23 euros.En este caso se entienden las diferencias de precio por cuestiones de log\u00edstica y econom\u00eda de escala, pero por favor Amazon, \u00a1un 75 % m\u00e1s cara la versi\u00f3n USA!\u00bfPor qu\u00e9?",

Radiating in a circle from out there the light gradually fades.I am a transcriptionist so typing response is my biggest priority:Typing response: 4+/5Large Print: Awesome 5/5Latency: NegligibleBacklighting: 2/5Gaming: 4/5 (FEAR series, Bioshock series, Assassin's Creed, Dead Space series, and more)Note: Not a mechanical keyboard so if you cannot soft-type without banging keys this might not have a long life. Treat it like a delicate laptop keyboard and you will be fine. I can type with zero typing sound so no problem.",
