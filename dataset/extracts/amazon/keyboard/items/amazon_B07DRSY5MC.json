                "reviewText": "Not really sure what I was expecting with this keyboard, but I was pleasantly surprised at it's quality. This is my first mechanical keyboard so I dont really have anything to personally compare with it, but for around 30 dollars it's a killer deal.What surprised me the most was how good the lighting was! It lights up the keyboard with this modern look, and paired with the futuristic font it looks like something out of an early 2000s scifi movie. After finding the manual online (which was admittedly pretty easy) and figuring out how to change the effects, I was surprised with how many there were and how good they all looked! Makes me sorry I didn't get the RGB version. While the font is futuristic it isn't difficult to read and I can tell what everything is.I've tested mechanical keys before, so I know generally what they're like, and I have to say these are quality switches. They aren't low profile, the keycaps are, so I'm using a makeshift wristwrest with it, but they're designed off the cherry MX stems so they're compatible with anything you want to add to them. The switches themselves feel high quality, and I've had no problems activating them or with the feel, like you would with other ripoff brands. There's hardly any wiggle in the keycaps.They chassis itself feels lightweight, but at the same time it feels incredibly sturdy, and I haven't been able to flex the keyboard at all. It has a metal backing and some sort of hard plastic on the back, which make it overall really sturdy.Overall if you're looking for a solid, cheap mechanical keyboard with good backlighting and a good tying experience, then this one really is a diamond in the rough. Nice job Eagletec!",

                "reviewText": "I use this for touch-typing, not gaming, so YYMV if you're looking for gaming equipment. Based on my initial typing work, I'm quite happy with the keyboard feel. No mechanical keyboard will be as quiet as a quiet membrane keyboard, so I'm getting \"sound dampeners for mechanical keyboard\" and will see if that's as quiet as I'd like it to be, while still having a mechanical keyboard feel.NOTE that this keyboard comes with a novel educational feature, in that it forced me to look up the manual (online, easily found) and learn how to control the keyboard backlighting, because it started out with a crazy-making moving lights background that made it impossible for me to type (until I literally closed my eyes). I'm usually too lazy to consult the manual and learn about cool features, but that was really not an option here. A quick glance at the manual taught me to use FN+INS a few times to make the light steady, and FN+<down-arrow> to make the light dim and then off. And, if you've read this far, now you know too.",

                "reviewTitle": "One of the cheapest MX Brown clone keyboard you can get. But there are some issues.",
                "reviewText": "If you're looking for a really cheap MX Brown equivelent board than this is the best bargain for an MX Brown board. The low profile version of this board and the regualr one are essentially the same, having standard height sculpted keycaps on the normal version and uniform height low profile keycaps on the low profile, between the two there is no difference in switch travel distance. There are some pros and cons about this keyboardFirst is the switches. They are ET Branded knockoff switches, which isn't a bad thing usually. Their tactility is pretty weak just as MX Browns tend to be and they do make an audable though quiet tick, they feel okay and they're not the smoothest switches out thetr but they're not rough either, that being said they feel dampened at the bottom out point which may throw off some people.Second is the stabilizers. They are cheap clip in stabilizers that are so loosely installed from the overly large gaps that you can hear them rattle if you shake the keyboard, if they had a tighter fit (i used a bit of electrical tape wedged between the stabilizer and the mounting plate) then they would be at least passable though still a bit rattly from not being lubed.Finally is the build quality. This keyboard is alarmingly light and does have a bit of flex but is at least somewhat ridged thanks to the metal mounting plate, though on arival the mounting plate was bent (pictured above) but don't get too discouraged because there is some good here.They keycaps are pretty good for such a cheap keyboard, in this case being the low profile but this does apply to the normal height sculpted keycaps on the reguar version as well. They're double-shot white ABS with translucent legends with a fairly clean though stencled font. Nothing teribly gamer'y at all here which is welcome at this price point. Second is the lighting. Though it may be dimmer than pictured the onboard firmware that controlls the lighting is very good having seen the same firmware on more expensive boards. It includles lots of preset animations and gaming layouts with two user customizable layouts which are very easy to set up, if yours happens comes with a manual.And finally the detatchable cable and rubber-shot flip out feet. These are a nice bonus to see on cheaper keyboards and they are becoming more common nowadays but at this price point it is certainly a welcome addition.Overall for the price you're not going to find much better than this unless you opt for the non backlit model saving you a few dollars or the RGB model which costs a few more dollars. If you go a bit more upmarket and get something more expensive and well built it will be better than this for sure. But at this price point you really can't complain much, If you're looking for a cheap MX Brown switch keyboard to take with you somewhere and not have to worry or in an office environment where MX Blues are too loud than definitly consider this an option. Maybe not a great one but an option but at this price it's hard to beat over any rubber dome office keyboard you see everywhere.",

It\u2019s a small think, but causes me constant annoyances, and after several months of this I\u2019ve decided to upgrade to a different brand.I should be able to use this keyboard for more than 12 months. It\u2019s sort of usable now, but everything about it is now frustrating to me.Even a very cheap product \u2014 $10-$15 \u2014 should not disconnect dozens of times a day after one year, so must give this 3 stars.",

The low profile design, quiet key, and that tactile feeling. And love that beautiful white color. This is probably one of my best purchase of 2019.

Mainly used this keyboard for everyday computing.After several years of use, some keys like shift keys have become hard to register, but otherwise still performs fairly well.",
