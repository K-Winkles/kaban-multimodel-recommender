                "reviewText": "I purchased this keyboard because I am long time fan of the consistent quality I receive from Redragon products and I was in need of a non-mechanical keyboard for my girlfriend as she doesn't enjoy the clicking of a mechanical keyboard, yet does enjoy the feeling of typing on one. This keyboard is a perfect choice for anyone that is looking to get that mechanical like feeling without all the noise. It is very quiet to type on and the keys provide a good amount of resistance as if you were typing on actual mechanical keyboard (might be a bit heavier resistance than my k580). Apart from the keyboard itself, I did have some issues adjusting my typing as they put the 'G' keys on the left side instead of top like some of my other boards. I kept making mistakes at first when typing, but that is something that is negligible once your hands are adjusted for the keyboard. Another thing that I do not count against this keyboard is that there are less options for color animations. The led's are bright and beautiful, but you only have about 7 options of setup compared to my other boards that had up to 18. This is understandable though, as unlike my mechanical boards, the leds on this board are not individualized to each key, but rather share 1/6 of the board at a time. If you use the customized lighting configuration (which is poorly explained how to use in the manual), you will see that after activating it using Fn+PgUp, you then use the Fn+(1-6 keys located on the top row only) to set each sixth of the board to a specific stationary color (And then locked in by pressing Fn+PgUp again). Because the leds are limited to sections rather than each key, there are clearly restrictions that limit amount of possible animation configurations. For me personally, I was not bothered as I only use the option that pans the rainbow across the board anyways. The last thing to talk about is the palm rest. It is hard plastic with a very nice texture and Redragon logo in the middle. It does add much needed comfort to this board as I found it sits higher up than most of my other boards. It is very to remove as well. The palm rest is magnetic (look at pictures). There is nothing special you need to do to attach or remove it. Just line up the rests magnets with the boards metal tabs and it hook right on and won't pop off on it's own. Removing it is as simple as just pulling it off. Overall, I think this keyboard is perfect for those who enjoy a mechanical feel, but either don't enjoy the sounds of a mechanical board (or have family that don't like hearing it). This board provides excellent performance and responsiveness that I always happy to see from Redragon.",

                "reviewText": "The letters and the background behind the letters are both lit, which I prefer. This allows me to work with the lights low and still see the letters. There are several light patterns to choose from. The keys have a nice feel with a low audible sound, which is much better than loud, clicky keys. I have found that I use the volume controls on this keyboard since they are in their own spot, separate from other controls. The programmable macro keys got in the way of me hitting the ESC key until I got used to them, but I also programmed the key that I kept hitting to be ESC also, so it's ESC no matter which one I hit. The others are great for other functions. I would buy this again if and when I need a new keyboard.",

This keyboard does the trick. Keycaps are nice. Membrane keyboard so typing doesn't feel like much. Lights are great and software is available to customize them. My only complaint is that the space bar tends to make a spring noise when you press on it. All in all, it's worth it for the price.",

Button doesn't make a noise like conventional mechanical keyboards, but they are very nice if looking with less noise and soft pressing. Regrading the RGB light it has many modes which you can adjust or set as you like. RGB light feels so classy and rich. I think it's worth buying if you have a budget of around 30 to 40 dollars,",
