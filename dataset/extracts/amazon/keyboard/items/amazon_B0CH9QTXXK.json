Well, of course I decided to get this for him. He's 68 and really doesn't need big letters on his key board as he's a good typer. I'm not however, and although I have a lap top I sometimes need to go on there to complete forms etc. Surprise! He loves the lights and is ok with the big lettered keys and lets face it we aren't getting any younger. Plugged it in right away, it's quiet and SUPER! Definitely would recommend.",
