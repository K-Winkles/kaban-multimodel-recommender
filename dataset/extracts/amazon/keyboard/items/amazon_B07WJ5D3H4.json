The low-profile design ensures a sleek and modern appearance, and I appreciate how the keyboard lays flat and stays securely in place during use. Its simplicity is its strength, and it's refreshing to find a no-frills keyboard that gets the job done effectively.One of the standout features is the affordability \u2013 it's incredibly inexpensive, making it an accessible option for anyone on a budget.

The keyboard is slim and lightweight, making it perfect for travel or for use in a confined workspace. The keys are responsive and offer a good level of tactile feedback, while the key travel is shallow but sufficient for comfortable typing. The keys also have a matte finish, which helps to reduce finger fatigue. The included USB cable is of good quality and provides a stable connection.Overall, this is an excellent budget keyboard that offers great performance at an unbeatable price. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a reliable and affordable keyboard.",

Since almost everyone has given this a good review, I will hope the new one will work fie.The complaint about the raised marks on the J and F keys is interesting to me, since my Keytronic Lifetime keyboard has been around so long those marks are worn out. It will be interesting to see how long the marks on this Amazon keyboard can be felt....--------------------------------------------------------I bought this as part of a Raspberry Pi giveaway for people who can't afford a computer. I am writing this review on this keyboard, and so far, it has worked flawlessly.One feature I like is that the function key lock is on the Esc key, and it works properly on my Linux box in either mode.It's quiet, the keyboard action is good, and I have not seen any \"repeat key\" or \"unwanted key\" behavior so far (of course, this is the last time I will use this keyboard, so maybe I'll pick up another one for myself to use as a spare.It might be costly, so I didn't expect it, but a telltale for the function key lock would have been nice.For the price, it's great. How long that will be true when it's in the hands of the recipient(s), I cannot say. But I hope they will get many good years out of it.",

There are no cool features like back lighting or wireless operation.It's just a basic keyboard:It is quite cheap.It does just work.It does have all of the basic features you would expect from a keyboard.It has volume control keys too.It is rather quiet.It will never run out of power (since it's wired with a nice long cable).It is fairly compact but has well spaced keys.One fault that other reviews have mentioned: the bumps on the home keys (F, J, 5) are too small, so it's not so easy to feel them.When my fancy, wireless, back-lit, super thin, x-switch keyboard was left at the office, this one is still going to be a lot better than trying to type on a laptop that is on a shelf.",

                "reviewText": "This purchase was made necessary because there is a challenging environment that has damaged my Dell XPS-Windows Desk Top computer. The challenge falls to an environment overrun by Cats and more Cats, some are housed in Cages and most are not. These felines lay very willfully almost at will and have caused an unwholesome environment, they are dirty and require much to mitigate their place at all, however, the care required to properly see to this unacceptable over-run environment is that is in fact there are much to many to many and to many in the extreme that there are so many Cats that I have tried to protect my Dell Desk Top as well as other items that I wrap my HP 8710 Printer in plastic in an attempt to at least slow the progression of disaster yet both Cat dander(hair) as well as litter(sand) is everywhere and that is not the only dirty actions by these unwelcome challenges to cleanliness and a healthy environment. it has caused suffering and a loss of integrity as per my Desk Top Keyboard. I have had instances when they are found to be laying all over my keyboard and my Monitor shows even events that are sometimes difficult to undo. The ability that Amazon has provided has aided my hope to use it as best as I could under circumstances that are unacceptable. The Qwerty keyboard is reliable with Amazon being both reliable and efficient in its ability to deliver these items however required in a timely manner. The costs remain cost-effective and have allowed this opinion to at least in part maintain integrity as it applies to these critical components.",
