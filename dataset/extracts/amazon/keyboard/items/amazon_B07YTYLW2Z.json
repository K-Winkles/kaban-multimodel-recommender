No offense to our more liberally minded friends, but I don't swing that way. I want solid rad so I can see my keys and read which key is which in darkness. This keyboard beats expensive Crosair-branded garbage that depends on me being logged in with a buggy driver running to set the key colors. I wish everyone made a sold-red version of their keyboards, but sadly, only Rii does.",
