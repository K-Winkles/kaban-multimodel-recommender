                "reviewText": "Full disclosure, I\u2019m not a PC gamer, but I do work from home so this keyboard was purchased for that. My Dell wireless chiclet keyboard died, so I purchased a Logitech MX Keys S. Backlit, chiclet style keys and extremely quiet when typing. I liked everything about it except the keys. They were super thin, barely rose above the base and were rather close together, so I had trouble knowing where my fingers were on the keyboard without looking, i almost couldn\u2019t feel when i move from one key to the other. I decided to abandon the chiclet style all together and went with this Cherry brand with brown switches. I absolutely love it. It takes a little time to get use to the additional travel from key to key vs a chiclet style along with the loud \u201cclick click\u201d of every key, but I love the bounce back of the keys and the tactile feedback. Each and every key color can be changed and there are preprogrammed light sequences if that\u2019s your thing.There is also a \u201cgame mode\u201d where you can disable certain keys, like the windows key, from accidentally being clicked. It has a heavy aluminum base which feels heavy and high quality. It is really thick so I definitely had to buy a wrist rest to help elevate my wrist.My only complaints are:- The white lights (I keep it programmed to all white) are more blue than white, especially compared to the Logitech which was a true white. (See attached)- the font on the keys is a little funky. If you aren\u2019t an avid typer and know where keys are, some can be very hard to read-to raise the height you have to remove the feet and screw in legs-lack of good manual. My wife accidentally locked some keys and it took a little bit to figure out how to fix it.These are minor complaints and I can definitely live with them. I\u2019ve been through ergonomic, standard, and mini keyboards from multiple brands over the years but this is my favorite so far.",

                "reviewText": "I broke down and bought this keyboard because three low-end models in a row had been pieces of crap, and this model was rated #1 on a \"best of 2023\" list for silent keyboards. So far, I love it, but it's taking some getting used to. All keyboards are slightly different, but the font on the letter keys is a sort of \"NASA\" space style font which is a little harder to read than your standard sans-serif keyboard letters. Even more different are the numbers and symbols on the number keys being reversed, so the symbols on each (! on the 1 key, @ on the 2 key, etc) are below the numbers rather than above.There are indicator lights for caps lock, scroll lock and number lock, but talk about subtle--I just found them!But I love the feel, I love the solid construction, I love how quiet the keys are, and I can type really fast on it. It's heavy and it doesn't slip or move while you work. I'm not using it for gaming, but I'm a writer and publisher, so I really need a good keyboard.The keyboard not only glows in rainbow colors, the colors continuously cycle in a slow pulse, which is definitely funky. When I get stuck on writing something I can take a break and watch the keyboard change colors while I think. :-)It works fine with my older Lenovo desktop, I just plugged it into an USB expander and zoom, it was good to go. The delivery was blindingly fast, it arrived the next day. The packaging...not so great. The keyboard had just been tossed into quite a large box with a couple of packing pillows. It arrived just fine (it didn't spend very long in transit!) but the manufacturers might want to know that Amazon is being a bit casual with their product.",

                "reviewText": "I had been using a Corsair K70 RGB MK.2 for the past two years, with Cherry Speed switches. My wife\u2019s computer is next to mine in our office and, yeah, it was time to say goodbye to it, due to how loud it was. Unfortunately, despite it using cherry switches, they weren\u2019t replaceable.In comes the MX 3.0s (wired) with silent cherry switches. Night and day difference.Pros:- Very quiet (with Silent Cherry switches)- Build quality- Software is easy to use, minor quirks.- Lighting is beautiful.- Assignable keys, with text and macros, too.- Calculator, Cherry and 3 multimedia keys.- 11 RGB modes are built into the keyboard plus one per key customizable mode.- Once you reassign keys and/or adjust lighting modes and apply the settings, the keyboard will remember them. In other words, you don\u2019t need the Cherry Utility software loaded at setup. For example, I made the track up/down/stop buttons to be volume up/down/mute. These volume keys exist as commands on the Fn-keys, but I wanted them separate.Cons:- USB connector. It is detachable, but you\u2019ll need to find a specific cable. I bought a 10\u2019 braided micro-USB to USB but it wouldn\u2019t fit into the keyboard\u2019s deep socket. The narrow opening versus the sheathing around the cable didn\u2019t mesh. I ended up using a USB extension cable to provide the extra length I wanted.- The lighting is gorgeous, but the white is more cool white\u2026 if it matters to you.- The optional wrist rest\u2026 hard to find, and it\u2019s optional. More below.I\u2019d buy this again and would recommend it.So, the optional AC 3.3 wristrest\u2026. Cherry America hasn\u2019t responded to my US availability inquiry and if I could buy it direct from them.. It\u2019s been several days. You can\u2019t find this thing anywhere in the western hemisphere. I ended up changing regions in Amazon to UK and bought the silver/white AC 3.3 accessory for $29 shipped (standard delivery to the US). It was onsale for $14 plus another $15 in shipping. It arrived in new condition within the week.",

That's why I took the chance to buy the Cherry MX 3.0 - opting for the S version, since I don't like the noise of mechanical keyboards.The keyboard is wired to avoid issues with lag. This keyboard, therefore, is super responsive.Typing is a dream with this keyboard, and I love the customisable LED lights (I recommend only using bright colours if you want to be able to read the keys).A bonus is that I got this keyboard in white! So many keyboards a black, which is so generic and would have more of a gaming vibe. White is a classier option in my opinion.Anyway, for office use, I highly recommend this keyboard.",
