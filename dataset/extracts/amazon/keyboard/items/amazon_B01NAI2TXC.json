                "reviewText": "I bought this keyboard because the one that came with my new PC had a weird problem with the space bar.I knew I wanted a mechanical keyboard eventually anyway, so after a TON of research, (learning about the dizzying array of features that modern keyboards can come with), I settled upon this keyboard from Red Dragon. I wanted a wired, full sized keyboard with backlit keys. After about two weeks of use, I'm happy to say that I made a good decision. I was also surprised with how quickly the keyboard arrived after placing the order.The keyboard feels solid and well made, but still sleek and modern looking. While it's a full sized keyboard, it doesn't take up a lot of real estate on my desk at all.It feels nice to type on, I enjoy typing and I'm pretty quick. I haven't had any problems with hitting the wrong keys or anything like that. It's also very satisfying, I like to hear the keys being pressed, so there is definitely a satisfying clicking sound, but I wouldn't say this keyboard is too loud at all. All the keys light up, there aren't any dud keys.Backlit keys were important for me, as I like to use my computer in the dark. If you like to have cool lighting effects, this keyboard has a lot of different modes, and it's easy to switch through them all. I prefer to have one solid color constantly, and I found the mode for that. You can also change the static color.I saw someone write in a review that they wanted a keyboard where you couldn't see lighting coming from underneath the keys, they just wanted the characters on the keys lit up. If that is something you are looking for, this keyboard is not for you. All the keys are raised up and there isn't any \"housing\" around the keys to stop the light from spilling out. This isn't a problem for me at all. Honestly, it looks pretty cool like this and it's probably a way to keep the price down.As for some reviewers mentioning a \"ringing\" sound similar to a chain link fence being hit, I can definitely hear what they are talking about, but it's honestly not very noticeable at all. While you're typing, you really have to be intensely listening for it to hear it at all. I brought my wife into the room to ask if she heard anything odd, and she said no. I then told her there's a ringing sound which she still couldn't hear. Then I hit the backspace and enter key harder than I normally would, and then she heard it faintly. I would never be hitting those keys that hard during normal use. She laughed and told me that it's a silly complaint and one that she would never even notice.The only drawback on this keyboard is that there are no buttons to change your computer volume, or open up a browser, etc. But for me, I've had keyboards with buttons like that in the past, and I never used them as much as I thought I would. My audio interface is always right in front of me, and it has a volume dial for that anyway.",

                "reviewText": "* First, note that this is thicker than a politician's skull; the key surfaces will sit above the base by a good 1.5in.* The build is solid; in the even of an earthquake, just cower under this thing! The key action is smoother than a baby's butt and fortunately smells better and is much more conducive to typing on. In all seriousness, the travel feels great.* I work with a guy with a mechanical keyboard, and when he's coding away, it sounds like a 1970s press room. This one's much quieter, but it's not silent; someone a cube over is likely to know when you're typing, but probably won't be annoyed. If they give you any grief, have them talk to me ;-)Let's talk LEDs. With the default configuration, this thing is straight out of Rico's bling shop; you'll be ready to open your own little casino. If like me, you prefer to gamble in other ways, here's what I figured out:1. To turn to LEDs completely off, hold the Fn and press the down arrow until brightness is zero. Without light, the labels aren't very descript, so:2. To switch to solid light, hold Fn and push PgDn (mode six) until it goes solid.3. You can change to a different color using Fn-Right Arrow.Since I like things about as flashy as an accountant's baptism, I went for solid, but if I had enough personality to impress the old-folks on karaoke night, I'd actually choose one of the three settings under mode 2 (Fn+Home). Rather than just static animations, they light up in response to typing. Pretty cool! I think I would even select it if instead of starting dark, and responding to typing, they would start solid and dip. This way the keys would be lit normally, rather than looking like a 7th grade dance floor. Call me Persnickety McGee, but someone has to defend practicality!",

                "reviewText": "Got a few opinions on it that I\u2019ll list below1. The build quality is insane. Very heavy all metal thick frame that you can tell will last a life time. It\u2019s solid, does not feel hollow and is basically built like a tank.2. Typing is a joy on these. The switches are tactile but not that loud. I bought this keyboard to replace the Redragon VATA K580 because I purchased the blue switches. It was fun at first but the novelty of being new to mechanical keyboards and clicky sound wore off in a few months. Can\u2019t stand that sound anymore. Note there is a slight ping when typing but I guess that\u2019s on par with un-lubed switches and all metal frame construction. Does not bother me as I wear headphones all the time at my desk so I don\u2019t hear it.3. Aesthetically it\u2019s gorgeous. The brushed aluminium design combined with the metal Redragon Dragon logo (not the word itself which I don\u2019t particular like how that looks) looks top quality and expensive.4. The feet are a major improvement over the K580. The feet are thick, durable and don\u2019t slide around like the K580.5. Hot-Swappable \u2013 It\u2019s very easy to take off a switch as opposed to the K580 which requires you to basically yank at the switch with brute force. The brown switches pop off and on really easily so in future I can have some fun with experimenting with other Outemu switch types.6. My only complaint was the choice of font for the following keycaps: CapsLk, Tab, Shift, Ctrl, Win, Alt, Fn, PrtSc, ScrLk, Pause, Ins, Home, PgUp/Dn, Del and End keys. The letters are all different sizes and the RGB does not shine through evenly through them. Decided to swap them with my VATA K580 and it looks way better. The keys do sound a bit higher pitched because they aren\u2019t double molded like the original but I\u2019d rather it look good that sound uniform.I am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this keyboard to anyone. I am actually tempted to buy another on to experiment with switches and keycaps given how rigid and sturdy the keyboard is. This keebs is amazing and typing this review on it was a treat!",

                "reviewTitle": "Great Keyboard for the Price",
                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this keyboard after looking around for about 4 months. What sold me was the positive reviews, regarding the quality, brightness, colour feature, and sound/feel. After a few days, I have to agree.The keyboard has some weight to it, which is fantastic as someone who CONSTANTLY nidges their keyboard by accident. No more accidentally moving by keyboard, going to type, and my alignment is wrong. Additionally, the keyboard has grips on the bottom, which really helps it feel sturdy when I have to type quickly. The legs are solid and offer a great angle for typing. The keys are a nice thick plastic, and feels like it would last a long time.The brightness is great, because I like to have my light active day and night. It allows me to brighten and dim the backlight very easily. The light itself is very bright at the highest setting, but not so bright that I'm blinded. This was an issue I had when picking a new keyboard. None of them seem to have a nice middle ground; they were always bright as the sun or \"dying flashlight\" dim.The colour feature is one of my favorite features. I knew I wanted an RBG keyboard, but I found many were limited to the colour you could choose for a solid light. Also, A LOT of other keyboards made you pick a light pattern, and this keyboard actually lets you have just normal light lol. Other reviews have also said the custom colour/pattern doesn't stay when you unplug your keyboard or turn your computer off. I have not had this issue at all, but I read the manual lol. If you download the software for it (like the manual suggests) you can set 3 light profiles for the keyboard. Once you set a profile to use and customize it the way you want, all the customizations stay. I know because I customized my keyboard at home, on my personal laptop, unplugged it, then plugged it into my work computer, and settings didn't change. Another thing, THE COLOUR SELECTION IS AMAZING. You can choose from a custom colour scale to get the exact shade you want, it's awesome.Lastly, the sound and feel are perfect for me. I like the sound of an old mechanical keyboard, that's been used a lot lol. I find that sound very pleasing when I type because it gives me that light clicky noise, without being too much. But I hate it because keys are always loose and didn't provide enough tension when I typed. OH BOY, was I glad to find a red switch keyboard! It offers me that more muted mechanical sound, and plenty of tension that it feels proper, but not so much tension that I have to press super hard to activate the key. It's also not so obnoxious, that it'll drive my coworkers insane. There is also enough space between the keys that I don't mistype as often, but not so far I can't type properly. I have very small hand (like really small lol) and this is a constant struggle for me, but not here (woohoo!).Lastly, this review is based purely on my personal preference and use. I use this keyboard for typing only and do not play PC games with it. So, I can't really comment on that side. However, I do a lot of typing at work and at home; so this fits my needs very much. If you have similar preferences as me, I highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Such a solid quality feeling piece of tech. Quite heavy. All steel body. IP67 rated. Swappable keys (although limited to oetemu switches). I'm telling myself this could be a lifetime keyboard, especially because I'm already old, but we'll see.My use is about 80% work, 20% gaming. So why a gaming keyboard? I wanted to try a mechanical keyboard, and the RGB lighting is just cool, worth a bit more money to liven up my work station. I had a huge internal debate over switch types, and one of the reasons I chose this particular keyboard was that it had the brown switches that I decided upon as the happy medium between clicky typing keys (blue) and linear gaming keys (red). Not many of the lower priced mech keyboard listings had the choice of switches, or didn't have brown as one of the choices. I can actually use the spare switches included to test this (nice inclusion by the way), but I won't bother. I feel comfortable with the browns, made the right choice.If you're coming from a membrane style keyboard, not an old fashioned typewriter trained typist, and never tried a mechanical keyboard before, whoo boy, get ready for an adjustment period. I was hoping that this style of keyboard would help eliminate some of my constant repetitive typos with my old Azio keyboard. Not so, at least not yet. Initially, I found mechanical to be less forgiving. It's kinda hard to explain. Hitting these keys, that are isolated from each other with only empty space between, and have a deeper stroke or travel compared to membrane style, just feels like you have to be more accurate. And I'm not 100% on how the anti ghosting feature works. But I think I'm quickly getting used to it.I've seen a few reviews complain about the software, but I had zero problems locating and installing it from the Redragon website. It is a bit strange that I can only get the program to run if I right click and run as administrator, but maybe I did something wrong in install. Not really a big deal. The software is a bit janky to use, until you get it figured out.The RGB lighting is fantastic. Too bad it doesn't have perimeter lighting and that the dragon logo isn't lit, but that's nitpicking.I might miss my dedicated media keys for a while, but I'll get used to using the Fn keys pretty quickly.The font on the keycaps is a bit small and weird. It's kind of modern techy looking, appropriate for a gaming keyboard, but not practical if you are a poorly trained typist with aging eyes like me.",

Spare keys are browns only, little disappointment that no other option to customise4. Keys are custom Redragon keys, not Outmeu , however very smooth with little bump, nice to type in5. RGB is great.
