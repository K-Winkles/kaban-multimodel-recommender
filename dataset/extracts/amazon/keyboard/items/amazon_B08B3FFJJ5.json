                "reviewText": "One of my office user's Logitech keyboards was dying and the newer version of them from Logitech had horrible reviews about reliability. The local car dealer had these at every workstation and was swearing by them.Construction is very good, lightweight yet solid and not too lightweight to be sliding all around the desk. Feels much more solid than the Logitech wireless keyboards I've used over the years. Key response is more tactile than the Logitech, but nowhere near as tactile as a mechanical keyboard. I'm a keyboard snob who owns multiple IBM Model M keyboards, along with quite a few other mechanical keyboards. This keyboard is not those by any stretch of the imagination. BUT, it's quiet when typing and is a major upgrade from any built-in laptop keyboard.They claim it has a 6 month battery life at 2 hours a day. I think they're being modest. I bought this keyboard back in October and don't remember if we charged it fully or just took it out of the box. I just got a call from the user that her keyboard stopped working today (mid-April). That would be 6 months at 6-8 hours a day.I still prefer my mechanical keyboards, but I'd gladly use this over a laptop's built-in keyboard. And for the price you can do a lot worse.",

                "reviewText": "Since there are apparently no images of the bottom of this thing on the internet, here's one.This is a good keyboard and probably the best scissor in its price range. The keys are durable and are the exact right height. There's no wobble to them. They seem durable; you can hammer on them. Very many scissors in this price range are frankly unusable, so this is significant. I've previously returned a Perixxx, Macally, and Dell scissor keyboard at the same price. I also returned 3 mechanicals before this, all _far_ more expensive than this. They're just not an option for typing, I've decided.It has a design flaw: the F keys are the same size and shape as the rest of the keys, and are directly above the number keys. Because of this, your fingers can't feel where the number key row is, and I end up looking down a lot. Almost all keyboards have a space above the number keys, or F keys that are a different shaped, or are spaced differently, so your fingers can feel that they are at the top of the number keys. Most people subconsciously use the number keys as a guide for their fingers, and you don't notice until that guide is removed.I actually put stickers on the F keys so that I can feel them with my fingers. That helped a lot.I don't love that the keys are rounded, but I'm getting used to it. I have another Arteck scissor (they don't have model numbers; not sure how to refer to them!) with square keys, and I prefer those in general. That one is another good scissor keyboard; I am currently using it for my laptop which has a broken keyboard. It's so slim, it sits right on top.The key rounding is not too extreme, so the empty space it creates between keys is only at the corners, which I can live with. Any more and I wouldn't be able to, and I would still prefer that they were rounded just a hair less.The indentations in the keys are very shallow. They look deep in pictures, but in person they are so shallow that you can hardly see them or feel them. This is not a criticism-- the effect is very subtle and I like it, it's just not as extreme as pictures lead you to believe.The power light has an odd behavior (and different than my other 2 Artecks): when you turn the power on, the light turns on for a couple seconds, then turns off. I don't mind this, in fact I prefer it: I don't need a light on all the time that's not telling me anything I don't know. It also has a \"battery low\" light, so when the power IS low, you'll know why, removing the one need for a power light. So it's not a criticism, but is unexpected.",

                "reviewText": "Product is fresh out of the box, so I can't comment on battery life or durability, but there's a two year warranty, so I'm not worried in the slightest.The keyboard looks great. It has a reassuring heft in my hands, which lends to the impression of sturdiness and functionality. The keys all press very well, and register cleanly.Finally, and most importantly, I bought this gambling that it would work on the same receiver as my Arteck mouse. The bet paid off! Both can function with a single input: a huge bonus, as many modern laptops only have one, (if any) USB port.For ~20 dollars, it's worth every penny.",
