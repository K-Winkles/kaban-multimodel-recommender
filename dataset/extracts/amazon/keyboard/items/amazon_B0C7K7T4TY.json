I liked the idea of being able to remove the keys easily and clean under them. The included brush was a handy addition.Unfortunately, when I went to type on it, I was hitting the top row of keys and hitting the shift button and making all kinds of mistakes. I normally type about 80 words a minute without errors. The round keys did not work for me.At the end of the day, the look of the keyboard was not enough to make up for the way it performed.I returned the item and that process was without incident.",
