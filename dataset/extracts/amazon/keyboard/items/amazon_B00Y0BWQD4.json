I'm not taking the case off to type. But..The keyboard looks and feels solid. It's not compact. The keys have a solid click to them and it connected to my phone instantly.

I just noticed it now as I type this review using the keyboard. I've had the keyboard for almost 2 weeks and use daily throughout the day. I simply Google Logitech K480 keyboard manual and it pulled. Changing from one device is as easy as turning the dial and the surface fits perfectly in cradle. My iPad has an Otterbox Defender case, so of course it does not fit in the cradle. Soon my Surface will not fit the cradle because it too will have an Otterbox or some type for glove fitting case. Also the phone fits with or without is glove fitting case. I cannot comment on the range because my eyes cannot see small print from 30 feet; basically, my device and the keyboard and always together. There is a battery life indicator, but not exactly sure where its located.When switching devices there are no delays as I expected. The dial is easily turned so if its not working then check the dial; I usually find that is my issue. Other then that I have not has any issues.",

This keyboard keeps itself asleep to preserve battery life. When you start typing it will remember what you press and push it through once it reconnects.It's slightly heavy, but the battery life and ability to switch things is worth it. This is my favorite switcheroo keyboard.Original Review: Excellent keyboard featuring the three-way trading between different bluetooth devices.Though the keyboard works great when connected, connecting it and keeping it connected is a challenge that meets me almost every time I pull this thing out.Purchased from Best Buy",
