                "reviewText": "Here we are, going down the rabbit hole of mechanical keyboards. This is my first kind, I opted for the blue switches as I love the feel/feedback and sounds. The keyboard does require a wrist pad (preference of course), which provides comfort for long periods of typing. The build is beautiful and the thick base gives a feeling of stability. The keyboard is not hotswap compatible, which isn't a deal breaker for me as I lean towards blues/brown switches and wouldn't plan on updating. The key caps are replaceable, which is a great option for people wanting to customize and if the lights were to stop working. When the keyboard lights are off, the letters are a little difficult to see. This option did come with extra key caps, but the light does not shine through like the gray/black. For the price and quality, I think the keyboard sells itself. I will update the review over time but completely happy with the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the MageGee Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, and I must say that overall, I am quite impressed with its design and functionality. The keyboard offers an excellent typing experience with its tactile keys, providing the much sought-after sound and feel of a mechanical keyboard. Typing on it feels satisfying, and it enhances my gaming sessions.One of the standout features of this keyboard is its illumination. The backlit keys are bright and add a visually appealing touch to the overall design. The lighting options provided are also a nice addition, allowing you to customize the keyboard to suit your preferences. The vibrant illumination truly enhances the gaming atmosphere, making it enjoyable to use in dimly lit environments.However, there is one aspect that I found disappointing. The company displays the keyboard as having red backlit keys, but in reality, none of the red keys are actually backlit. This discrepancy between the advertised product and the actual product received was a letdown for me. I had specifically chosen this keyboard for its color scheme and the allure of backlit red keys, but unfortunately, that is not what I received.While this may not be the end of the world, it did impact my overall satisfaction with the keyboard. It's important for companies to accurately represent their products in their marketing materials to avoid misleading customers. In this case, the lack of backlit red keys was a disappointment, considering that it was a key factor in my purchase decision.Despite this drawback, I still find the MageGee Mechanical Gaming Keyboard to be a solid choice in terms of its design and functionality. The tactile keys and impressive illumination make it a joy to use, and the absence of backlit red keys does not affect its overall performance. If you're not particularly concerned about the color scheme and backlit keys, this keyboard could still be a great option for you.",

My only complaint is I thought the letters on the keycaps would be transparent, so that the back light shines through, as shown on the other models. I wanted the black and white model with the diy orange caps, and noticed that the pictures do not show the light through the caps, so technically, my fault. Also, packaging did not come with the back-lit setting commands. Used the photos in the reviews to learn how to adjust the light settings.Perfect keyboard.Very satisfied with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I grew up with the classic IBM and later on, Chicony keyboards. However, as time went on, I migrated to the common membrane keyboard of today. I was looking for something new, just because I'd worn down the letters on my Logitech K120. I decided I wanted something with a backlight, because I tend to write and game in the nighttime. Most inexpensive lit keyboards today have a multi-color rainbow light set, that just doesn't appeal to me. I found this, read the reviews, and figured I would give it a chance.100% best decision I've made in a while. Not only is it aesthetically pleasing, the tactile and auditory feedback have got me excited about typing again. What's more, because I can FEEL the keypresses, I believe I have improved my typing. Over the last few years, I have had the experience of transposing letters while typing, because my right hand is naturally stronger than my left, and my left handed keystrokes lagged. This is greatly improved because I can feel the key depress on the left before I hit the key under my right hand. I can't believe this actually helped!Overall, I'm very impressed with the build quality, it is probably five or six times as heavy as my old keyboard, it doesn't slide around the table, and it just feels solid. The riser feet in the back even feel strong and I'm not afraid to open and close them as much as I like. These are usually cheap press-fit plastic and I have broken the feet off many keyboards in my day. The cable is actually in a cloth braid, very shi shi.The light pattern feature is nice, but I really only want the basic backlight, and dimming, which this does no problem. I wish the logo did not continually blink. It's annoying, and I may tape over it because it doesn't seem to have a toggle.I purchased this at $36 and I think it is a very very good deal at that price. I feel like my computer is a computer again. Very few upgrades will improve your system as much and as cheaply as this keyboard.",
