                "reviewText": "This is the best keyboard and mouse I've had in quite a while. I needed a quiet keyboard and mouse for my online meetings, and this fits the bill perfectly. Both are VERY quiet, with no keyboarding picked up by others at all while I'm taking notes during meetings. It's also lower auditory stimulus for me as well, as I find the keyboard clicking affects my concentration. The keys have a good feel during typing, just the right amount of resistance but without the clicking noise. I had gotten a thinner model from another brand that used a silicone keyboard cover to help dampen the noise, but it just ended up tearing under use by fingernails, and the mouse was super cheap and flimsy and inaccurate. I should have known to stick with Logitech. Always quality. Bonus, it comes with batteries, and Duracell, not a cheap generic brand. Another great and dependable product. Highly recommend if quiet keyboarding is important.",

I had a lower end gaming keyboard that met all of those things. It failed at all the basics. Keying was completely unreliable via the dongle or Bluetooth. Charging was flaky out of the box and I had to use the cable.This keyboard is everything I took for granted. It\u2019s a tad less ergonomic than larger keyboards but I realized quickly the trade off was fine as I had more room on my desk. If you type a lot as a data entry person or programmer, then it might become a problem. For regular users, the ergonomics is fine.",

I just got a standing desk converter and its nice to not have to worry about the wires when moving from sitting to standing position.The keys are very quiet and so are the buttons on the included mouse. This is my first time with a wireless keyboard and I really like the convenience of it. I like that it has just 1 USB receiver that works for both devices.I also tried this with my xbox Series X just out of curiosity and it works great with that too. I don't have an immediate need for that but its good to know that it is an option.",

                "reviewText": "The noise reduction on this keyboard is outstanding. It's almost disorienting how quiet it is, especially given that the tactile experience is not compromised. You still get full, deep key travel with every stroke (which, to me, feels much more satisfying than \"slim\" laptop-style scissor switch keys). And the membrane switches are not too mushy feeling, despite all the sound reduction techniques.The sad part is that *some* of the noise reduction mechanisms wear out really, really fast. Specifically, what Logitech has done to reduce keycap noise -- the brittle, plasticky sound as you lightly tap or run your fingers over the keys and they rattle in place. There is almost NONE of that noise when this keyboard is brand new, and it's shocking how much of a difference that makes. I didn't realize how obnoxious that noise was until I got this keyboard and it was essentially eliminated....for about 3 weeks. This dampening wears out quickly on keys that are used frequently. The plasticky sound, while still not as loud as a normal keyboard, is beginning to return as I tap or run my fingers over the keycaps. Lesser used keys (number pad, function keys) are still nice and quiet, but over time I'm sure these will also become noisier as I continue to use them.Fortunately, other noise reduction techniques like internal damping and other key switch improvements are still there, so despite the keycaps getting a little bit louder over time, it's still quieter than a standard keyboard.I just wish it would've been silent for a tiny bit longer, as it was quite the experience typing on a full-size, full-travel keyboard that made almost no noise. Then again... it's only thirty bucks.The mouse:It's quieter than a standard mouse, but small and uncomfortable. I ditched it pretty early on in favor of a full-sized Logitech mouse, so can't say much more about it.The dongle:THIS KEYBOARD/MOUSE SET IS NOT UNIFYING. You must use the dongle it came with. Very annoying, especially when you have several other Logitech devices that you previously were able to mix and match. Because I'm using a different mouse than it came with, I now have to occupy TWO USB ports: The dongle it came with (for the keyboard), and a Unifying dongle for the mouse.Why not fewer stars?This keyboard/mouse set is ridiculously affordable. Despite its shortcomings, it's excellent for what little you pay.",

It's very precise, no fingers slipping off the keys. I cannot say enough good things about how quiet the keyboard is. The only downfall I've found is with the mouse. The mouse is almost TOO responsive/sensitive. This could be a user error on my part, but I've never had a mouse this sensitive. I find myself right clicking on accident very frequently. The slightest hand movement will click the button. It hasn't impeded my work, it is just annoying. I enjoy the keyboard so much that I can overlook the sensitive mouse though.",
