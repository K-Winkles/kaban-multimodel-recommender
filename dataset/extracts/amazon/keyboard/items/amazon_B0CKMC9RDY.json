So, using a wired keyboard was becoming a problem as I could not move it when I needed to write. So, I tried this Bluetooth keyboard, and I have to say, I am impressed with it. First of all, the price is really catchy. Every keyboard I have seen online is around $35, so buying this one was a to-go. I have spent almost two months with it, and my typing experience is awesome. It is not clicky at all and does not give the fatigue of typing for a long time. The metallic color is also pretty attractive. It's responsive to my typing command with no latency issue. I have not changed the battery yet, so it is a good thing that it does not take much juice to continue working. It has a bevel-shaped stand at the top, which keeps the keyboard tilted and makes typing easier. Overall, it's a good keyboard.",

                "reviewText": "I picked this up to keep at my desk at home for the ~20% of the time I WFH. I don't have a lot of space, so a compact keyboard with no wires was the ideal.This keyboard connects quickly with the included dongle. I'm not an especially fast typist, but I have noticed it occasionally misses a key - I'm not sure if this is due to the connection or the keys are just a bit stiffer than what I'm accustomed to. Nevertheless, it works fine for it's intended purpose - if you're looking for something higher end, expect to pay a bit more for it.",

                "reviewText": "Love this keyboard! It is smaller than my last keyboard which is the usual size for a keyboard. And my old one wasn't cordless. What a difference. It looks so much better without a cord. Since, it was smaller I examined it to make sure it had all the keys my last one did and to see what was different about it. It does have all the same keys. What they did was shorten some of the keys like the backspace and the actual space bar and some others. It doesn't bother me any. I think it's a handsome keyboard. And it takes up less space which I needed desperately because I have too much stuff on my desk all around my keyboard. The color isn't black but instead a gray/silver color. But the actual keys are black. Oh, and it was so easy to set up. Since I never had one before I was a little worried about this part. When I got it and opened the box a tiny usb piece fell out of the back into my hands. (be careful it doesn't drop onto the ground where you can lose it) It is located in the back in the empty battery compartment. The lid for my battery compartment wasn't closed properly and is the only reason it fell out. It takes 2 double A batteries. Put the batteries in and then put the usb piece into any usb port you have on your computer in the front or back it does not matter. Turn the little switch on the keyboard on and that is all. It started working! So far, I love it. It's perfect for me and I am very happy with it.",

                "reviewText": "Out of the box I had some connection issues and had to follow the instructions to unpair and repair the device with the USB wifi dongle (hold two buttons down), and it eventually worked better. Also some of the function keys like the email and home buttons seemed to freeze the keyboard when connected to a windows computer and I had to repair it again. The media controls work fine tho.Overall a decent keyboard but I wouldn't want to use it as my daily driver. I got it to use occasionally with my xbox, and it's fine for that. It's a nice size and fits in my TV stand drawer easily, plus I can use it on a coffee table with space next to it for a mouse.The keys are flat on top (not cupped) so my hands kind of skate around on top while I'm typing, and the texture of the keys is slightly rough but surprisingly slick. I do get keypresses that don't register when pressing the edge of a key, and especially if pressing the bottom 25% of the space bar where it just rotates and doesn't actually press the switch. It reminds me of a laptop keyboard I didn't really like because I had to press a bit harder than I'm used to, and also press directly in the center of the keys every time. As a fast typer, this kind of extra focus required to ensure accurate keystroke registration slowly drives me insane after typing for a while, as I'm used to mechanical desktop keyboards.Personally I use Eneloop rechargeable batteries in everything, so I prefer that this uses AAs and isn't rechargeable.",

                "reviewText": "This keyboard isn't bad, but it could be better in a few ways. The positive, simple plug and play, the keys are quite receptive, and the keyboard feels semi durable. The negative, there's very little riser on the keyboard making it feel like a laptop keyboard instead of desktop, further along that line, the key size and locations of other buttons reinforce the feeling of a laptop keyboard, finally, it's got some weight to it, heavier than expected.",
