                "reviewText": "Keyboard arrived on time. It's not as quiet as a laptop keyboard, but this is great for using it for anything else outside of work. Purchased as I didn't want to wear my main keyboard out.Some things you'll get used to is missing the arrow keys and the Numpad keys on the side for easier typing and accessibility. Hence the 60% keyboard term you'll hear when it comes to keyboards.However, the functional keyboards does have a Fn keyboard across the keyboard, and it fulfills these functions:- Up, Down, Left, Right arrows- Increasing, lowering, and muting sound- Changing colors and turning them off completelyI wouldn't recommend this as a nighttime keyboard, or if you room with people who'd complain about the clakety noise. Small and sturdy, the keys are positioned so you can press them lightly. Not quiet or vibration-like as a membrane keyboard from Logitech.I'm enjoying this keyboard so far, and I can't wait to get used to the new functions that the Fn key presents.UPDATE (2/24/2023): I accidentally spilled my drink on it, and the keyboard no longer works on it as of yesterday. I spilled my drink on it on Wednesday, and Thursday evening - the lights comes on but the typing is no longer there.If the keyboard does not work again after the same length of time after purchasing my second keyboard (without spilling my drink), I will purchase another keyboard for the time being.Update (4/12/2023): This keyboard has been working very well so far. I'm still able to type at my normal speeds without any lag, and it's great for gaming as well. Very satisfied with this purchase. If you're looking to buy the keyboard from the official website, buy it from Amazon. The official page doesn't look that experienced in case something happens like a lost delivery or something. But I'm very satisfied with this brand, and will be passing it on to someone who's going to enjoy it as much as I do!",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Snpurdiri 60% Wired Gaming Keyboard and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations. The compact design with 61 keys and RGB backlit feature adds a stylish touch to my gaming setup. The keys are clicky and smooth, providing a satisfying typing experience.One of the standout features of this keyboard is the included wrist rest. It offers excellent support and comfort during long gaming sessions, reducing strain on my wrists. This is especially important for gamers like me who spend hours in front of the computer.Another great advantage of the Snpurdiri 60% keyboard is its waterproof feature. Accidental spills are no longer a cause for concern, as the keyboard is designed to withstand liquid damage. This adds durability and peace of mind, knowing that my investment is protected.Overall, I highly recommend the Snpurdiri 60% Wired Gaming Keyboard to PC gamers. Its compact size, RGB backlit, wrist rest, and waterproof design make it a fantastic choice for those looking for a reliable and high-performing gaming keyboard.",

                "reviewText": "I mean it works, but it feels light and cheap and very much like a toy.Next time I'll get the Corsair, pretty sure that one wont feel like a toy. My last keyboard was a full size heavy mechanical keyboard and I just wanted something smaller. But I realize now that I see it in person there's no 'del' key, so it wont get me into BIOS during a boot. And the way the arrow keys function is really weird. And you really have to stretch with your pinky to reach the enter key which is awkward at best.for $25. it's ok, but.... I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.edit: Tried to use it today for work. It's missing crucial keys like tilde ~ so I couldn't use it to get into directories I needed to access for work. So the keyboard is basically useless for me. Maybe it's ok for a gamer or someone who just types, but if you're a sys admin or someone who really needs to use keys for navigation, accessing directories in a terminal, or accessing BIOS in startup, this keyboard will not work for you.Tossed it into the box-of-parts and will probably just give it to my kids the next time I build them a computer.",

His computer setup is based on white color and it's the main reason for selecting this keyboard. If you're looking for a small form factor gaming keyboard and don't need the numpad this is a good option. So far it's working well and he didn't have any issues. Key clicks are not too loud, we prefer this so that it doesn't bother anyone else when he's at his PC playing games while others are chilling in their rooms. One thing to mention it does not have a standalone \"Delete\" key. If you use it a lot you might find it annoying that you have to use the \"FN\" key and backspace when you need to use the \"Delete\" Other than that he is happy with his new keyboard.",
