                "reviewText": "Really great product and the connection to Bluetooth is quite strong. Only problem I had was 3 keys popping off, one broke completely but it was a key I never use, so it was not end of the world. The plus key still does not stay down but it has not really affected my productivity. The right button of the mouse became a little mushy and does not click anymore but it still does the job. Definitely a good buy.",

                "reviewText": "First of all, everybody who left a comment saying the usb receiver didnt come with it need to know that the receiver is inside the mouse, open the place where you put the batteries and you will see it in there for you to pull out.Now, the first day of using the keyboard the left side had no functionality. I saw that the keys only worked on that side if lifted it up in and held it in an angle while typing with my other hand. This is particularly annoying because the only reason I bought it was to replace my old wireless keyboard which started having a similar issue (ironically I am typing this review now with my old keyboard).Then after a few days I noticed the mouse looked like it was lagging and lacking proper response time. Thought maybe it was my computer and maybe it had a virus, BUT NOPE! I switched back to my old wireless mouse and everything was smooth and even in motion.Overall, if your like me who wanted to just get a cheap $20 wireless mouse and keyboard, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Cough up another $10-$15 dollars and get yourself something that will at least last longer than a few days lol.",

Put the USB transmitter in, put a battery in keyboard and mouse, and you are good to go. I like the smaller light keyboard as i have my pc connected to my tv and use it a lot in bed.",

                "reviewText": "I have had this product since May, 2023. Over time it has gradually lost functionality. Instead of using my mouse or keyboard to wake the computer up, I first have to unplug the dongle, remove the mouse battery, plug it back in and put the battery back in in order to get the mouse and keyboard to wake up. It has now progressed to skipping letters when I type or entering double letters (I have to now type slower to prevent this from happening) and the mouse lags and skips all over the screen unless I have it set to the slowest setting. As the months go on, this mouse/keyboard set has become more of a frustration than a tool, so much that I have finally bit the bullet and ordered a new (hopefully better) one that has a 24 month warranty.",
