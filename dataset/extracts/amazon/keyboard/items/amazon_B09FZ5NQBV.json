            "104 KEYS GAMING KEYBOARD: The MageGee K1 LED keyboard is a standard full-sized keyboard featuring excellent light transmission, splash-proof design, indicator lights, wired connection. Sensitive trigger, fast response, plug and play, no driver required. Compared to clicky mechanical keyboards, this keyboard produces a soft sound with accurate feedback on every keystroke, making it a great choice for those who prefer membrane keyboards.",
            "UNIQUE AND STYLISH DESIGN: The pc gaming keyboard is composed of a transparent housing and a weighted metal base. The light is therefore displayed over the entire keyboard as well as the keys, while the light of other keyboards is actually only visible around the keys. The strong construction makes it long-lasting and never deformed, more practical and worthwhile.",
            "FANTASTIC 7-COLOR LED BACKLIGHT: The gaming keyboard has 7 color options: blue, red, green, pink, cyan, yellow and white, which can be changed by pressing the FN and TAB keys. There are also 4 light modes: dim, bright, pulse, and off. Hold down the FN key + ESC key to cycle through the options. The light will auto-off after 10 minutes of inactivity, press any key to wake up. The gorgeous lighting offers a more aesthetically pleasing look, allowing you to immerse yourself in the game.",
            "19 KEYS ANTI-GHOSTING & 12 MULTIMEDIA SHORTCUTS: 19-key rollover allows you to press multiple keys simultaneously without issues. Multimedia combination keys ( Fn + F1-F12 ) achieve convenient operations, quickly access the music, email, website and other frequently used programs. You can also switch between the W A S D keys and the arrow keys by pressing FN + W keys to enhance the gaming experience.",
            "ERGONOMIC DESIGN: The scientific layout of the high and low keycaps gives your hand a natural fit, bringing maximum comfort and effectively reducing hand fatigue after long-term use. Double-Shot injection moulding process makes the characters never fade. Floating keycaps are removable, easy to clean and feel good in the hand. The light up keyboard has non-slip pads on the bottom to enhance the stability of the keyboard and prevent it from moving back and forth.",
            "WARM TIP: THE K1 PINK / PINK & WHITE KEYBOARDS HAVE 7-COLOR BACKLIGHT WITH SWITCHABLE LIGHT COLORS AND LIGHT MODES. THE K1 BLACK / WHITE / GRAY & BLACK / WHITE & GRAY KEYBOARDS HAVE RAINBOW BACKLIGHT WITH SWITCHABLE LIGHT MODES."

Keys were clunky and loud, and the enter key was weirdly shaped and just awkward to use. So back to Amazon I went and ordered this one in the hopes it would be better. It went above and beyond my expectations. The keys are soft, and whisper quiet (except the space bar for some reason). I made sure the enter key was just a straight horizontal wide key before ordering. The price is fantastic, and it is absolutely beautiful. Works right out of the box (I don\u2019t know any that don\u2019t). The only slight gripe that could be said is it does not have the fold out feet most keyboards do, but it doesn\u2019t seem to matter. I\u2019ve been playing wow all day, and absolutely no complaints!",

                "reviewText": "I got this for my work desk because I wanted something cute and I also can't stand the standard HP keyboards with the shallow keys. I don't mind that this keyboard is wired, it doesn't get in the way and doesn't bother me. I like that I can change the light color modes, I typically keep it on the color changing mode. I was a little hesitant because I don't like super loud keyboards or the sound \"mechanical\" keyboards make, but this sound is totally bearable; it's not quiet, but not obnoxious either. While typing the keys move super smoothly, no clicking or sticking or anything. The base is flat with no lip or raised edges so it's super easy to clean. The only downside is that the num lock light has started to die pretty quickly from being on all the time, but that's not enough to dock a star, just something I've noticed.",

The only issue I have with it is that a lot of the keys rattle when clicked, because they're loose. The spacebar is the biggest culprit. It takes away from the nice clicks that they keys have. The keyboard also isn't quite as pink as is shown in the product pictures, and is slightly more pale. The keycap plastic is also thin, so the combo makes the backlights wash out the actual keyboard color.",

Other models of this brand are amazing and I hoped this to be as good as the others Probably there was a reason why it was at a lower price than the other models. In conclusion, if you care about the light and you need to see the light through the keys you press, look for a different model.",
