                "reviewText": "The operation of this keyboard is simple and easy. I received it, put in the batteries, and paired it with my phone. The whole process was great and super simple. I love that it has 3 channels to pair with my other tablet and anything else that I might need.The keyboard feels nice and sturdy. It does not feel cheap. I has nubs on the bottom to keep it from slipping around. The sound of the keys are creamy and quiet, very non-distracting. I chose the lipstick colors and they are soothing in appearance, not too gaudy or bright.I am very pleased with this keyboard purchase. I wish i had gotten it sooner.Working perfectly today, unsure how long the 2 AA batteries will last at this point. Appears to be a great value for the money.Side note: my keyboard arrived in no extra box, it was in a slip sleeve box that was from the manufacturer. The keyboard itself was wrapped in one layer of bubble wrap inside. The slip sleeve box had all the info on the outside for any nosy neighbor or thief to see what was being delivered. Totally NOT the makers fault. I did not appreciate Amazon delivering it without the extra protection and privacy of a shipper box.",

                "reviewText": "I recently bought this keyboard for my girlfriend as a gift. I was seeking the market for a keyboard with Bluetooth function so that we can use it at home anywhere. Useful for relocating from bedroom to dining room. I was attracted by the appearance first for this product, the round and picky color design really give a cute sense and nice eye punch for me.Upon receiving the product, the packing is quite simple, so that if you want to make it as a gift, make sure to pack it with a nice warp and stuff it with some deco. I bought for use and to my girlfriend, so that we are okay with it.The product is made with plastic, honestly not the steadiest build I have own. But overall, the build is solid and no rough edges. Keyboard have round keys but the keys are flat, I found it not quite easy to type on, since it does not keep my push well. And the overall shape is round corner too, great design and give it a super cute and lovely vibe, my girlfriend love it. Color is cute too, and it really pair with my girlfriend s room. Pinky color for all!The keyboard is power by AA battery, I found it to be okay, since for my experience, it should hold up for about month or so. however, I will be loving it if it offer usb C charging. Additionally, the connection is decent, setup is easy too, turn on turn off quite fast.At the end, I would say the keyboard for this price, deliver quite a offer, it give a nice appearance which is matter the most for my girlfriend, and the functionality is on part of the market. Price tag is reasonable, not expensive. Although for a guy that favor better Mechanical keyboard. This small Bluetooth keyboard does a good job I have to say, offering a nice gift for those who favor the design and color. With the price, no complaints, but I wish can be better in material and builds.",

I\u2019m a home health nurse, and the documentation notes on my patients are rather lengthy, and I absolutely despise typing them on my tablet, mainly because I have a lot of carpal tunnel issues & it\u2019s just plain painful at times.Enter, this keyboard! I used it for the first time last night, & it saved me SOOOOO much time! The letters take a little getting used to, due to them being round and not squared, & they are slightly closer together than a regular desktop computer.keyboard board. But, I\u2019m still so glad I bought it & would definitely buy it again! I\u2019ve al ready paired it with my work tablet (Samsung Galaxy A7 Lite), my phone (iPhone 14 Pro), and my son\u2019s iPad (9th gen) \u2014 all have paired easily & work perfectly!I can\u2019t vouch for the longevity of this keyboard yet, but so far, so good!Only cons.. #1: there is no power button, so I just take the batteries out when not in use, so that I don\u2019t run them down super fast;#2: not sure if this is the case for every keyboard, but the one I received has 2 N keys & no B key; however, the N key on the left (normal spot for B key) types B\u2019s, so it\u2019s just labeled incorrectly. Doesn\u2019t really bother me, because I type off muscle memory anyways.Long story short\u2026 she\u2019s cute & you need her!",
