Now I can type at full blast. Just have to get used to the extremely tall keys.Aesthetics: There are a plethora of RGB settings that include every color and quite a few light show designs. Very pleased. Best of all, on board memory that saves your settings! Don't have to load your clunky program every time you boot up to set lighting settings. Now if only the rest of Aura Sync was this user friendly.Functionality: Crisp keystrokes, very loud keystrokes, nice semi matte finish, wrist rest is a great bonus and kind of needed for these ridiculously tall keys. Seriously everyone, what is with mechanical gaming keyboards and their huge switches. Make them smaller!All of this for a competitive price! Love this keyboard. Thanks Asus.

The keys and switches are quality and perform well. They might be a little \"clicky\" for some people, but I like it.The odd thing with my keyboard was that it had two fours on the ten-key instead of a one, as you can see in the photo. I called ASUS customer service and they said they would send me a \"one\" when they got some more in. The CS rep said it might be a few months, and I'm coming up on two in a few days. It doesn't affect the performance.My only actual complaints, if you can call them that, is that I wish it had a larger CTRL key like my previous keyboard. It could also be about a half-inch wider on either side. I've got big hands, and I can't get my left wrist all the way on the wrist rest and type at the same time.It is a great keyboard, though, especially since I only paid $79 for it.",

                "reviewText": "What can I say, this keyboard is very nice looking by all rights. The keys when pressing are works of art. Doesn't take much to press and the key is either typing your letter or making it's first maneuver is the game you are playing. The magnetic wrist pad is awesome and very comfortable. Looks just like the pictures from ASUS, so I wasn't going to bore you with a picture you have already saw. My last gaming rig I built was back in 2007. This key board is such an upgrade as well, I don't think I'll be enjoying my typing on anything else.",
