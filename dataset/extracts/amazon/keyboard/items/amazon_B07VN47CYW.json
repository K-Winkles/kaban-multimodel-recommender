                "reviewText": "UPDATE: Nearly 3 years of near-daily use and it still works great. Even small spills of liquid or crumbs don\u2019t seem to affect it. Holds a decent charge; I usually charge it every few weeks. My cat \ud83d\udc31 jumps onto my desk and will occasionally press a key with her paws; causing a delightful havoc but no damage or other problems. I\u2019m getting another one to use at the office now that we\u2019re back; I\u2019m hoping this will be much quieter than the wired Dell keyboard I have now, and also free up a USB port.After the first week of working from home on my living room couch, I decided I needed to move to a more productive and less distracting space in my downstairs den. I have a PC there with a wireless keyboard but it uses a USB dongle. To use it with my company laptop I'd have to move the dongle from my PC to the laptop. (Yes I know, First World Problem.) My laptop only has two USB ports in it, and I'd hoped not to take up a precious USB port as I need the other for my Jabra. I also didn't want to keep moving the dongle back-and-forth between computers.This has been a great alternative, in terms of price / value, convenience, construction quality, and features. They offer this in a cheaper version without Bluetooth, but I am glad I got this version. It took a couple triesd to pair with my laptop, but once I did it hasn't needed to be paired again since, and is fully functional. It has an on/off switch, but it will also turn itself off to save battery life after a few hours of non-use. Just tap a key or two and it comes awake.It can be set up to work with up to three different devices supporting Bluetooth, including phones & tablets (but I haven't tried that yet). There are three different buttons to tell the keyboard which device to connect to, so I can also switch it to use it with my home PC.It is thin and light, but the keyboard is almost full-size including a numeric keypad and arrow keys. This is nice for all of the Excel work that I do. The keys are somewhat flat and shallow, like the \"chiclet\" keyboards on some 80's computers, but I've gotten used to it. They have solid feedback, and I don't make many errors (except the ones I usually make anyway). One thing I haven't adjusted to yet is, sometimes when I want to use the left Shift key, I usually hit the Caps Lock key instead. I usually see my error and correct it, but I will have to adjust with time. Others here have noted the keyboard is not tilted, but I haven't found it to be an issue.It is also very solidly constructed and good quality so far. As I'm writing this during the Coronavirus pandemic, I do try to disinfect it occasionally (at least a few times a week) with a light mist of either isopropyl alcohol or hydrogen peroxide, and a wipe-down afterward. This has caused no issues to battery life, functionality, or appearance. I haven't tried bleach, nor would I recommend it.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent keyboard that checks all the boxes, designers put some thought into this one!",
                "reviewText": "So, it's a keyboard, aside from basic function it comes down to personal preference. The only thing I really want is a keyboard that is easy to type with and has quiet keys. I have really come to enjoy laptop style keyboards, specifically the 'scissor' switch style, they are short throw keys that have good tactile feedback (you know/feel when you pressed the key enough).This Arteck keyboard has excellent key movements in my opinion. I am finally moving from a Perixx wired keyboard to this one after being unable to find my normal USB keyboard. Of course I have some reservations about moving to a purely wireless keyboard (battery life, charging, etc).With those points in mind, I have not had any issues with this keyboard at all. The automatic sleep is well implemented, tapping any key wakes it up. I can easily go for a full week without recharging, and I can use the keyboard while it is charging. Bluetooth has had zero issues, (except when I go to airplane mode. DOH!). Bluetooth pairing was super easy, and the keyboard lights work very well to identify which pair I am using (can pair up to 3 devices).On the topic of lights, etc, here is another example of good design (at least in my opinion). The keyboard only has five lights, two are single function, one for charging, one for power. The other three are each dual function, LED 1 is for number lock or BT connection 1, LED 2 is for Caps Lock or BT connection 2, and LED 3 is for Function lock (nice feature!) or BT connection 3. The LEDs are green and stay illuminated when indicating a lock feature. For the BT connections they change to blue, but only stay on for a few moments. For the vast majority of your use the LEDs are green to indicate the features that are active on the keyboard.Overall: keyboard connects and just works. Keys feel great. No issues with lagging, and battery management has been excellent. No reservation at all to purchase again.Only possible downside: this keyboard was thinner than my last keyboard and felt uncomfortable when it first arrived. I added about 1/4\" of foam to the bottom to get similar height as my last keyboard.I am very much enjoying this keyboard and i hope this information helps the next person!",

                "reviewTitle": "Absolutely excellent bluetooth keyboard",
                "reviewText": "This is the third keyboard I've purchased from Arteck. Not because it's a poor product. The exact opposite. I've purchased two of the smaller bluetooth keyboards to use with tablets and phones, and they've been excellent. Long time between battery charges, ability to connect to multiple devices, good key feel, good response. Overall, quality products for a really decent price.So I wanted a full size keyboard to go with my desktop, and purchased this one. It was packaged nicely and came in excellent condition. It already had a charge on the lithium battery, so I used that to do my initial BT pairing with my Dell Windows 10 Pro desktop. That went very smoothly, and so I then plugged it into a USB adapter to fully top off the battery. I've been using it for over a week now... using it at least three to four hours per day, and when I just checked it's still over 75% battery remaining.There's a little key at the top right next to the bluetooth pairing keys, and if you press it, it will flash the blue power light once for every 25% of battery remaining. After a week of daily use, it's still flashing four times, so hardly any battery consumption at all. Which translates into not having to recharge it very often, which is a nice situation to find yourself in. A great feature so you don't get stuck having it die on you in the middle of your work. You can see when it's low and recharge it proactively.As noted, it has a really nice key feel, and it quite quiet. Truly, the only thing I wish it had were some pop out support legs on the underside to raise the back of the keyboard up off the desk at more of an angle. That is my one and only negative associated with the keyboard. And it's not a show-stopper by any means.Am I happy with it? Yes. Do I recommend it? Absolutely.",
