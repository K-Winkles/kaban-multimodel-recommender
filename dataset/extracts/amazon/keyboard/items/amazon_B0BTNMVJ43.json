I have been using mine for about a month and not only is the compact design truly space saving the case that comes with it is very sturdy. I am able to pack everything into a fairly compact laptop backpack. I have had a number of my co-workers order these as well after seeing how easy it is to move around, switch offices or work stations with this compact set up.I would like to also compliment the battery life. I do charge it periodically but have been on week long trips running the keyboard and mouse 6 to 8 hours each day without needing to charge it up. With the compact design I thought I might need to do that more often but it is certainly not the case.",

The advantage this keyboard has over the MX keys is its portability. The keyboard feels solid and the folding mechanism has magnets to keep it shut. it has some odd feeling hinge protection caps but they too feel solid. it comes with a solid case that works well as a little mousepad for the included mouse. the mouse also connects to up to 3 devices similar to the keyboard. there is also a little phone/tablet stand that I am not using but it looks like it could get the job done.I do wish that the keyboard had a way to lock into the open position, it makes using it in my lap sometimes awkward.",

Super compact storing but give full range of full keyboard when folded out. The mouse is perfect size. It\u2019s slim but not too small. Over the past few years you can see the evolution of standard mouse and keyboard sets getting smaller. I have larger hands so the small mouse makes my hand cramp and feel unsupported. This mouse is the ideal size and shape to work long hours with. Battery life is great and in the month I have used it working remote it has been charged once. It can charge and be used at the same time and it charges very quickly.",

                "reviewText": "This foldable portable keyboard is impressive. I have been using another similar keyboard, different brand, for several months now. It was ok but it had limitations, the most annoying was the Fn lock keeps unlocking every time it goes to sleep, maybe 5-10 minutes of idle time. It also did not have dedicated PageUp/PageDown/Home/End keys, which is a big issue when Fn keeps unlocking, plus I was tired of having to press Fn every time I use PageUp/Down which I need to do all day because I deal with Excel worksheets. So I started to look for another and I stumbled upon ProtoArc XKM01. My order arrived quickly. I just tried using it and I am so glad I bought it. Fn stays locked and the dedicated PageUp/PageDown/Home/End keys are a HUGE deal! They layout is a little different from a regular big keyboard but I can get used to it. The case is big but it fits in my work bag, so no problem. The mouse is flatter than what I'm used to but it's not a deal-breaker, I can get used to it. I'm so glad I bought this keyboard/mouse combo! I used bluetooth connection and it was a quick set up.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I primarily got this keyboard/mouse combo to use with my Samsung tablet and it looks like it\u2019s going to be a keeper. I\u2019ve gone through so many foldable keyboards but it\u2019s always been a compromise\u2026 but I can\u2019t think of anything negative about this keyboard from ProtoArc.It is a little more expensive than most, but after using it, I can understand the higher price point.The build quality is excellent. The folding design is unlike any I\u2019ve seen or used. The two side \u201cwings\u201d of the keyboard lock in place when folded up so it\u2019s secure\u2026 normally this wouldn\u2019t be a \u201cbig\u201d feature but this keyboard will pair with your last device as soon as you unfold it. No more turning the keyboard on or off. So I can appreciate the locking mechanism on the folding keyboard so it doesn\u2019t unfold in your bag and pair with your device unintentionally. The scissor switches on the keyboard are very responsive with precievable delays, and are quiet to type on. The keyboard sits flat and the sides don\u2019t flex while typing. It\u2019s an excellent typing experience.The mouse\u2026well\u2026is only ok\u2026 not very ergonomic but well built and very similar to the Magic Mouse for Macs in its slim design. The scroll wheel is nice with a ratchet feel.I think the other feature that makes this particular set stand out from others is the option for both keyboard and mouse to connect to 3 different devices: 2 via Bluetooth and 1 using a 2.4G dongle. Switching between the 3 connections/devices is just a matter of hitting one of the 3 yellow keys on the top right of the keyboard. Unfortunately, the 2.4G dongle is USB-A\u2026 and all my devices use USB-C so I couldn\u2019t test the 2.4G connection. For most, I think the 2 Bluetooth connections will be enough. The other odd thing about the dongle\u2026 there\u2019s a compartment under the mouse for you to store the dongle when not in use\u2026 but it just kinda slides around in there and rattles every time you move the mouse. I just stored the dongle in my drawer. Personally, I don\u2019t think I want to carry around a USB-A to USB-C dongle just to use another dongle.You also get a little kickstand for your phone/tablet so it sits up while you use the keyboard.Overall, I really like the extra details that went into both the design and function of this keyboard. The mouse is good though I don\u2019t think offers anything exceptional (other than adjustable DPI levels), but it works well. As mentioned, this keyboard and mouse combo is a little more expensive than others out there, but in this case, it\u2019s justified with the 3 connection options, great folding design, and it\u2019s a full-size keyboard. I\u2019m more than happy that I\u2019ve found a keeper.",

                "reviewText": "A welcome card and letter to the consumer is included with this kit. You can see it in one of the included pictures. To the designer \u2018Howard\u2019, I say \u2018Great product design\u2019. This travel keyboard and mouse combo is professionally packaged and includes extras that I really appreciate.Here is what I love about this keyboard/mouse combo:1- Very well-designed foldable keyboard.2- Keyboard has full size key layout.3- Easy to type on and excellent key travel and response.4- Keyboard and mouse are Windows and Mac OS compatible.5- Both keyboard and mouse are rechargeable.6- USB-C charging cable included.7- Wireless connectivity with included wireless receiver that stores in mouse.8- Bluetooth connectivity for up to 2 devices.9- Special keys for quick access to wireless, Bluetooth 1, or Bluetooth 2 device.10- Mouse is sleek with smooth scrolling and quiet buttons.11- Kit includes a foldable tablet or smartphone stand.12- This kit includes a protective case that has a handle and storage mesh compartments.The mechanism for folding the keyboard together is intuitive. When the keyboard sides are folded out, there is just enough pressure to hold them in place. I tried using this keyboard on my lap and it stays together as long as you keep your knees closer together to support where the keyboard hinges. As soon as you open the keyboard and unfold it, it is powered on. There is no power button on the keyboard.Although this is not an ergonomic keyboard, its not designed to be. It is light, portable, compact, and excellent for the traveler. The case can fit in a reasonably sized laptop bag. When the keyboard is folded, it is only 8 inches long and 4 5/8 inches wide.I am using this keyboard and mouse combo in my living room as I have both a Windows Mini PC and a Mac Mini that I have hooked up to my large screen TV. I sit about 20 feet away from the computers and this keyboard and mouse work well at this distance. It\u2019s easy to toggle between the two computers by just clicking and selecting which paired Bluetooth device I want to use.Typing on the keyboard on a table is comfortable. The keyboard has rubber feet to keep it secure from sliding around. If you\u2019re using a tablet or an iPad, you\u2019ll appreciate having the full-size keys to type on when you\u2019re on the go. The number pad is also available as a full-size keyboard has.The mouse is compact but feels comfortable in the hand. The buttons are quiet, and the scroll wheel is quiet too. There is an orange button on the top of the mouse (that matches the orange connectivity buttons on the keyboard) for adjusting the DPI levels for the mouse. On the bottom of the mouse there is a connectivity button and an LED indicator light showing what device you are connected to. There is an OFF/ON button too so you can shut the mouse off to conserve battery power.The case included in this package is also of excellent quality. It is durable and is more of a hard case than a soft one. Everything fits neatly in the case with some room to spare.Well done, Howard! This entire package is impressive. Great design, professional quality for all components, excellent performance. This would also make an exceptional gift for a techy. 5 Full Deserved Stars!",

                "reviewText": "I needed a better alternative than the native keyboard of my work device, a Lenovo L14 Gen 2, for in-office days, but I didn't feel comfortable lugging around my Keychron K2 Pro. This ProtoArc XKM01 keyboard & mouse combo was just the solution I was looking for as it has not just the keyboard & mouse but also a handy carrying case. Most importantly, it's compact and lightweight so it's got a very low impact when packing into my backpack.Compared to a traditional mechanical keyboard, like my Ducky and Keychron that I use at home, it's not going to be as good but it's still an okay typing experience. For in-office use, it's relatively quiet so you won't be annoying your coworkers. The spacing between keys is alright - that is, I've had some portable keyboards with some funky layouts and awful spacing before. It's got many multimedia keys which have been handy for work. I've been using the product for about a month now and the folding hinges have held up fine - everything still works. It's got some small rubber feet that keeps it in place decently while in use.The mouse is just average though. I'm definitely not a fan of the thin style and mouse shape. It also doesn't feature any additional buttons - side forward/back buttons are a must for me. I ended up carrying a Logitech one for my in-office days instead which fortunately fits into the case. Only hassle with this is that the 2.4G dongle is normally stored in the included mouse's under-compartment but I've just stowed it in the case for now - I find Bluetooth finnicky at times so while I could just go without the dongle, I would rather keep it on hand just in case, but it is easy to switch between the modes at the press of a button.A USB Type A to USB C is included for charging - it's just a run-of-the-mill cable. I'll probably replace it with a more robust one down the line. At the very least, I'll bring another cable since each of the keyboard and mouse would require one to charge simultaneously.The case is a decent hardshell type. It's got individual mesh dividers for the keyboard and mouse on one side and another divider on the other side (e.g., for storing the USB cable). The zippers close up well and there's been no snagging/jamming.It also comes with a compact, fully-foldable phone stand.All in all, this is a very good value full, portable solution for in-office productivity.",
