                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using this keyboard for a little over two months now, so here\u2019s what I\u2019ve noticed so far. I purchased this for my 2nd Gen iPad Pro, because getting an Apple keyboard for it was going to cost a lot out of pocket, and that product had some so-so reviews, which I found odd for something that costs so much. That being said, this isn\u2019t a high end product, but it functions extremely well all the same. The keyboard itself is pretty compact, which took some getting used to, as I\u2019m more accustomed to using a standard sized keyboard, but after a couple days I was able to adjust to it just fine. It has a couple of multimedia keys on the upper row for video scrolling, playing and pausing, as well as a screenshot button, a search button, and a button to bring up the on screen keyboard. Great for on the go as it is extremely lightweight, though I\u2019d be wary about packing it with heavy items without extra cushion, as it is rather thin and easy to bend.After the first couple weeks, however, I began to notice certain keys not responding as quickly as they should, namely the space and caps lock keys. Sometimes it also backspaces twice even when I only press once. As I mainly use it for typing long documents, this can sometimes be a bit of a pain to deal with. However, it is a rare enough occurrence. As it is a low profile keyboard, it isn\u2019t the most ergonomic one, nor the quietest, so typing away at night without proper support can leave your shoulders aching in the morning. I do wish it had some sort of backlight, on that note, as I tend to type in low light or with the lights completely off. I have had one key come loose after it fell on a carpeted floor, but it was easy to snap back in with a simple push. All in all, this little keyboard gets the job done for a reasonable price. So to sum it up:PROS- lightweight- cute color- simple to set up- great price- long battery lifeCONS- sometimes unresponsive- a bit on the flimsy side- no backlight- keys can detach if not careful- loud keys",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Alright, I\u2019ve spent the last month using this and I figured I would give my review. I\u2019ll do my best to give a few characteristics that I feel are important and then I\u2019ll leave a summary at the end. Feel free to skip to the summary if you don\u2019t want to read all of this.Typing: This is the main reason I love this keyboard. It has a \u201cnormal\u201d keyboard feel to it. If you enjoy a Mac style/thin keyboard button layout (I mean the height/thickness of the actual buttons), this keyboard isn\u2019t for you. I like thicker buttons that feel like a traditional keyboard, because I can type faster with it.Connectivity: Another important aspect of a Bluetooth keyboard. It does lag a bit, but I have a high(er) typing speed (I usually type around 75-80 words per minute). But it does a good job of keeping up and it gets the job done.Battery life: I guess it depends on your use and the type of batteries you purchase. I\u2019ve left the keyboard on for days at a time, because I forgot to turn it off and it still works a month after I purchased it.Ease of use: I use this with my iPad Pro and it took a few seconds in order for it to sync with my Bluetooth. I have no complaints about this aspect of the keyboard.Summary: I\u2019m going to rank this product five stars, because I never have any issues out of the keyboard (no malfunctions, major problems, defects, etc) and it gets the job done. It was easy to connect, it uses a small amount of battery, great keyboard feel for those who love \u201ctraditional\u201d style keyboards, and it is extremely portable.*If you found my review/photos helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking the helpful button below.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Works with Apple TV!",
                "reviewText": "Edit: I've discovered that this works with my Apple TV! No more searching by selecting one letter at a time with the remote. And this keyboard is cheaper than buying a new apple remote! (You'll still need a remote to first connect the keyboard, but once it's working, you can just use the keyboard).One thing I see other reviews complaining about is the auto-off feature. You know what that feature is great for? A keyboard used as a TV remote! You just leave the keyboard turned on, and it will go to sleep when you are not using it. It does take a couple seconds to reconnect - a keyboard icon shows on the screen to let you know it's reconnecting.Original ReviewI\u2019m writing this review on the keyboard, and my iPhone. This is working fairly well.Pro:It works! Seems to work well, I\u2019m having no problems here.Setup: There\u2019s a little card included with the keyboard, makes it simple to setup. Turn it on, and type a code that it gives you. Takes seconds.Function Keys: There are dedicated keys on the keyboard for functions like volume, brightness, and even to open the normal on-screen keyboard.You can even lock and unlock your phone from the keyboard.Con:It\u2019s a bit noisy. To be fair, I tend to hit my keys pretty hard. I\u2019m learning to hit more lightly, since I\u2019m typing in a library. It\u2019s better on a book, there\u2019s a bit more noise when on a hard tabletop. Now, I don\u2019t mean loud like fire alarm, I mean loud for a keyboard.[EDIT: The keyboard has auto-off] I\u2019d like an auto-off. I don\u2019t see any mention of that, and on-off is a physical slide switch. Maybe turn off after an hour, it doesn\u2019t have to be fast. But I forget to turn things off, and I don\u2019t want that to kill my batteries one mistake. Half my reason for buying this is to have a backup if my laptop battery dies.Unknown:Battery life, durability. I\u2019m just getting started with it. Everything is fine so far.Other Comments:I\u2019ll note that an iPhone can use an external keyboard, and does have some support, like the on-screen keyboard doens\u2019t pop up when you have this keyboard attached. But in general, you can\u2019t do every thing from the keyboard. There are lots of places in IOS where it would make sense to have arrow keys work, like selecting applications and opening them. This doesn\u2019t work, you will be touching the screen a fair amount. This is NOT a flaw in this keyboard, I\u2019m just trying to set expectations for any iPhone external keyboard.It would be great to have a cover for this keyboard, I\u2019m just throwing it loose in my backpack. No problems so far, but I would feel a bit better if there was something to cover the keys.",

                "reviewText": "I recently upgraded my iPad 2 to the latest iPad and wanted a keyboard. I was considering getting a keyboard case but I knew I wouldn't be doing much typing with it while I was out so there didn't seem much point of the extra cost and weight, and on the occasions I do need to type I didn't want to use the screen keyboard. I'll have to admit that the first thing that attracted me to it was the price. When I took it out of its box it was clear that it was well made. Another thing that really appealed to me was the fact that it ran on two AAA batteries. Being able to use something that are readily available and cheap is definitely a plus, and there's no need to recharge it. Built-in batteries that will eventually stop working, making the whole device obsolete and needing to be thrown away and replaced is one of my bugbears with modern technology. Not so this. And if the environmental impact of regularly changing alkaline batteries is a concern, rechargeable AAA batteries are an option.This is a full-size keyboard (the same as my Mac one - sadly not usable on it though) and feels great to type with, and the function keys are really handy. Set up was really easy. The only downside I've found with it is if you switch it off it doesn't automatically reconnect with the iPad and you have to connect it in the settings - or I've missed something in the set up. But if you leave it switched on it puts itself to sleep and automatically reconnects as soon as you touch a key. So it's only a very minor issue that is soon excused when I remember the price.",
