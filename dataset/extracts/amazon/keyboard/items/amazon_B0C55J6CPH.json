This one uses batteries and is not rechargeable, which is what I wanted. I'm using the USB chip and not Bluetooth. Finally a keyboard that types the keys I hit, no skipping and no adding of letters!!! It's a little larger than other wireless boards but I mostly use it at the office with my large monitors anyway. The key layout is exactly what I wanted as well. The mouse is higher quality than the last couple wireless setups I've had. I did need to up it's speed setting which was easy. Too early to note the battery life but so far it's exactly what I wanted.",

Just stops working and sometimes turning it off then on again doesn't seem to always work. You have to wait a few seconds then try again. The keyboard is great took awhile before i got accustomed to it, feels comfortable couldve done better on the spacing i sometimes feel like im over or underreaching on Keys. Very responsive, no delays so far.",

                "reviewText": "So, just a few days outside the return window, the mouse just stopped working. I thought it might need a charge, though it had only been a few days and it lasted a couple weeks the first charge\u2026but, no, nothing. Tried multiple charging cables, USB ports, and chargers\u2026nothing. Wasn\u2019t a great mouse to being with, though it was a decent shape and very light, and the resolution button was handy\u2026but it isn\u2019t \u2018silent\u2019. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the buttons aren\u2019t clicky and annoying, but the scroll wheel squeaks like crazy and the whole mouse creaks a bit when you rest your hand on it. I was fine with it though, while it worked.The keyboard is fine\u2026thin key caps like a laptop keyboard, with smaller size keys than regular keyboards (also like a laptop), so you may mistype a bit. It is quite thin and portable, and I really like the layout. I do experience the \u2018double letter\u2019 issue some have mentioned, but it only happens now and then. Again, it\u2019s fine. Biggest complaint would be the huge \u201cUSB\u201d printed in white on the usb dongle\u2026yes, we know it is usb, thanks, no need to scream it to everyone who looks at my laptop. Anyway, it\u2019ll wind up in a closet since the crappy mouse died and I can\u2019t be plugging in two dongles (for a different mouse) since I don\u2019t have the ports for it.",
