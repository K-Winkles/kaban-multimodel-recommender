                "reviewText": "This mini combo, I found it fantastic!After receiving this exquisite set, I found it particularly eye-catching. Especially after using it for a few days, I like this mini bundle more and more. How I feel about the product is as follows :1. It feels super good. I have used a lot of membrane keyboards, some of them feel stiff, and some have super slow rebound speed. But this keyboard gives me a very comfortable feeling, a bit of a mechanical feel, but not noisy, and it is not tiring to use for a long time. Good for both work and gaming.2. A nice bundle. The brand matches the 61 keyboard with a small mouse with a personality, and it has a vertical feel. It can be said that it is designed for the user, and it feels full in the hand, and it does not feel very small at all. Wireless, plus compact, stylish and easy to carry, it is really convenient.3. The key functions are relatively comprehensive. I thought that 61 keys are just a few keys, which will affect the typing experience. However,In fact, the use of key combinations can basically satisfy the function of a large keyboard. Fn+W, switch between the WSAD and the arrow keys. And to use the ESC key, all you need to do is use the combination key. Just don't forget to switch back and forth. Being used to and familiar with key combinations, this is precisely the reason I particularly like this keyboard.4. The performance and quality are super good. A small keyboard, both the keyboard and the mouse are wireless, and the keyboard is true RGB, the battery capacity is realistic, and there is no virtual mark. Long battery life and no delay, this is precisely where the quality and cost-effectiveness are reflected, and I am satisfied. Overall, I highly recommend it!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Great budget keyboard for office work, but not the best choice for gaming",
                "reviewText": "I bought this set because I needed something that allowed me to type up emails and work from the comfort of... anywhere but my desk, to be honest. But I do enjoy playing games whenever I'm not working so hopefully this review will give you insight on its performance during work and gaming activities. Here are my thoughts:The manual is very rudimentary but it gets the job done. Luckily, there are no drivers needed for the keyboard or the mouse. The keyboard feels like its the right size for me, but the mouse is slightly small and awkward for my large hands. Even though the keyboard is chunky looking, it remains lightweight and portable. I wish that some of the extra space in the chassis was utilized by adding a kickstand so I could adjust the tilt to my liking.This keyboard has 6 key rollover, which means that it will register you pressing a maximum of 6 different keys simultaneously. This may not be a problem for typical office work, but this can become a problem in case you want to use this keyboard for gaming. Most other gaming keyboards will reach up to 8 or in some instances, 10 keys. For the most part, the Function (FN) combinations make sense except for the WASD function keys (which turns them into Arrow Keys). Every other function will activate by PRESSING the FN key + the indicated key, but the arrow key function keys require you to press FN + W ONCE, then letting go of the keys and pressing WASD. This can become very annoying if you accidentally toggle it since there is no indication if it is on or off.Both the keyboard and the mouse automatically conserve power when left to idle for a short period of time, which is excellent. I have read a review here that comments that you cannot charge the keyboard while using it. I can't confirm or deny that claim, but it is something to keep a lookout for since that is very difficult to test without having some kind of indicator of battery level. But while I am on the topic of power, why does the mouse take AAA batteries, but the keyboard has a rechargeable battery? I'd prefer if the keyboard and the wireless mouse were consistent in what batteries they use.PROS---------Compact and lightweight \u2013 Very easy to carry around both in a bag or toteWorks on both Mac and Windows (I haven't tried Linux but I see no reason why it wouldn't work)Several different light modes for the keyboard backlightHas surprisingly good signal rangeInoffensive design \u2013 can be as \u201cloud\u201d as you want it to be with the RGB lightsThe feel of typing on this keyboard is satisfying for a membrane keyboardGreat price point for what you getCONS---------The keyboard and mouse do not seem the most durable \u2013 Avoid dropping if possibleNo battery life indicator for the keyboardThe mouse does not have a rechargeable internal battery like the keyboardNo way to tell if you have FN key toggle active or capslock active without trial and errorCannot use the keyboard in wired USB mode (Wireless only)Instructions for activating Bluetooth mode (without the dongle) is not written in the manualSUMMARY---------The keyboard is a MEMBRANE keyboard that imitates the feeling of a \u201csofter\u201d mechanical keyboard. This can be good for you depending on where you plan on using this product. This product is fairly quiet and convenient for offices but disappointing if you want to hear those typical clicky, tactile switches of regular mechanical keyboards on the market. Overall, I would recommend this set if you need a mouse and keyboard for office work, but I would not buy this solely for gaming or if you are looking for an authentic mechanical keyboard. Keeping in mind the cost, portability and convenience, I give it 4/5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "Keyboard worked awesome, lighting was great with easy controls. Unfortunately the charging port stopped working after only 2 uses. Tear down was extremely simple, and for someone who works on electronics, so was the repair. The charging port appears to have been joined with soldering paste, which isn't all that great for something that needs a bit of structural integrity. The paste did not cover the top of the tabs whatsoever, and the mounting pegs, while they had actual solder, none of it was actually attached to the legs, something a little tinning would have resolved. The toggle switch also was of the same predicament, where the paste didn't cover the top of the tabs, and not what should be used for something having force repeatable applied to it.The mouse was also a throwaway, could not get it to work properly whatsoever. I'm not sure why nobody can make decent mouse outside of Logitech, but I've been using a $20 one from Walmart with 2 programmable side buttons as long as I can remember and it's left every high end gaming mouse in the dust.This keyboard has a ton of potential to be a great, and low cost wireless RGB keyboard, but it needs better quality control.",

Mouse was slughish sometimes and clicks were just not happening having to click 2-3 times to process. Had 3 types of batteries changed.In gaming is not helpful at all unfortunatelly...As I said, it doesen't suit me having the given issues, maybe someone else can live with them.
