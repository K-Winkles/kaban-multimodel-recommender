                "reviewText": "Love this keyboard.I had a Logitech G213 which is a ~similar~ price point but this difference is night in day in both comfort, build/material quality, feel, and lighting.Long story short, I loved my Logitech G213 but I had a weird issue with my spacebar, M key through to the ? key. At first I did a simple fix with taking the keys out and adding some extra paper into the trigger space (which sure you shouldn't have to do to begin with) - but even just getting this board out of the box, the feel, lighting, and material and build quality blow the G213 out of the water.Honestly I should be a mechanical keyboard fan given my living and hobbies, but for some reason I prefer the feel and sound of membrane, and this keyboard does NOT come close to the feel of a mechanical keyboard, it is still a very nice, premium high quality feel, nice travel per key and the keys themselves feel like VERY high quality matte finish plastic with much nicer lighting features than the G213 offers, especially being controlled via iCue.Back in the day I used to talk major trash about Corsair, but now my system is filled with their products like fans, liquid cooling, and now peripherals because they 150,000% stepped their game and quality up in the past 10 years.Also I wrote this entire review on this keyboard.TL;DRLove it. Great membrane keyboard, fantastic lighting features via iCue. If you're a mechanical fan and need a quieter type, it's not for you. But if you like the feel of a membrane keyboard, with nice RGB lighting and macro/ks control, this keyboard is top-tier and an absolute steal for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I installed iCue right away and updated the firmware (painless), then tested things out. In order to do 'custom colors' (besides the default colors), iCue has to be running, which is not great, but not a dealbreaker either. Without iCue, one can use the FN + 1-5 keys to adjust the hue of each 'zone'. Since I wanted static green, no issue there at all as green is a default 'hardware mode' color. When I reboot, the keyboard remembers the color and zone config without me using iCue, nice! In spite of using a 'zone' lighting scheme, each key's symbols are readily legible in the dark. Couldn't care less about macros, but this can handle those with the G keys.The keys have a slight wobble to them, and I guess some people may care about that; I couldn't care less as everything feels responsive and solid. It does not have a gigantic permanently attached wrist rest, thankfully. I prefer membrane keys but ymmv, and these are sufficiently quiet.I got this keyboard in new condition in a 'hassle free' package for about $26. For the features, not having to use software to change AND KEEP colors between reboots \u2014 and of course the bang for the buck \u2014 one would be hard pressed indeed to do better than this. If it breaks too soon I'll be sure to update this review.",

Works well and is relatively quiet when typing/gaming. Just note that the macro keys on the side may throw you off initially and mess with your muscle memory. Also, RGB is customizable with the iCUE software, which is a plus for a keyboard at this price point!",

                "reviewText": "To start off, I think this keyboard is phenomenal, but I feel I need to explain the reasoning behind my 4 star rating. So this may just be me, but having an extra row of keys to the left really messes up my knowledge of key location. My fingers feel another key on the left and I find myself typing one row off. Again, this may just be me, and is something I just have to get used to. The other issue is that the ergonomic support that the front wrist rest plate gives is great, however the quality of it is not too great, and the plate easily falls off, even when seemingly secured. And to cap this off, you are practically required to download the icue app on your device in order to use this keyboard because the keys are very hard to see in low light due to them being transparent, which I found I needed to see them because my issue with the extra row of function keys. On that note, you are required to download the app in order to use the RGB lighting function as well.But besides that, it is a solid built keyboard, with some nice heft to it that really lets you feel the build quality. With its built in media functions, and relatively quiet keystrokes, it works quite well for casual, or even competitive gaming.",

Other mechanical keyboards intended for quick response tap and clack but this thing is silent as a ghost in comparison. All while not sacrificing the responsive feel.I can take or leave the RGB lighting. It's fine. I guess. The macro keys are a bit of a pain since I keep thinking the top-most one is the \"Esc\" key but that's just muscle memory retraining, something you have to do with most keyboards anyway since they're all slightly different.Feels good, is quiet, I can skip tracks on Spotify while playing League of Legends without tabbing out.
