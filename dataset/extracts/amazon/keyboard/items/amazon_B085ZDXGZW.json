I decided to just go with a keyboard that had red switches not really caring if it was a gaming brand or anything like that. I went with this because the colors match my gaming setup.This keyboard gets the job done well. I use it to play multiplayer games like WoW, Fortnite or Overwatch. I haven't had any issues with it. I even spilled beer on this one and it still works. So it has that over my old keyboard. It has a nice build quality for a plastic keyboard. The numpad lights up. It also has legs on the back to adjust the height angle. The keys are lightly colored so over time they have gotten dirty. The lettering has not faded though and there have been no malfunctions. The keys have a decent sound to them. It types how you'd expect cherry reds to type, they don't make that loud clicky noise they are fairly quite. There is a little bit of a wierd echo though.Overall its a decent keyboard for the price about what you'd expect.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a keyboard for a PC build I was doing for my son, and I wanted to get a mechanical one with a good build quality but at a decent price, and this keyboard did not disappoint.I designed and built a custom PC case that was very sturdy, with clean but almost industrial lines to it with a similar color scheme to this keyboard, so when I was on Amazon looking for a mechanical keyboard without a num pad or LEDs, etc, I was excited to so this one pop up, and it was uncanny at how well the colors and overall design of this keyboard matched the PC.This is a nice compact keyboard without the annoying LEDs that are trendy today and has a really nice feel to it. I thought the key switches might be noisy and the key presses would be stiffer as I have found in a few budget-priced ones I have bought the last few years for builds I have done for others, but I was pleasantly surprised at how great these were with this keyboard.It has been in daily use on a gaming PC for a little over a year and a half and the keys and switches are still in great shape. That is because this thing is built like a nicely refined tank. It has a great weight to it and doesn't slide around the desk, and all of the materials are good quality. It has a nice cloth-covered cord as well.I definitely recommend this keyboard if you are into things that are well designed and built right, and the price is great for all of that as well.",

                "reviewText": "This is still my favorite keyboard because it's the most ergonomic and I love the aesthetic, but I do have to warn folks that the paint of letters/numbers wears off of the most commonly used keys after a few to several months. (Only a couple letters in my case.) It bothered me a little, but then I realized I barely look at the keys anyway. If this is a big deal to you, don't get it. If you don't care like me, buy away. Removing one star because of this though.==I usually prefer a blue switches keyboard, as I dig that satisfying audible click and the ease of pressure when typing. However, when I saw this keyboard, I knew I must have it despite it being a red switches board. I bought it purely for aesthetics and thought, hey, this might be good for Halloween and maybe as a back-up. In line with what other reviewers have said this is an incredible value for the price: it feels well-built and stocky, it's compact, and most importantly it types like a dream. My other red switch board must've been more cheaply made (despite it being the same price), as it was an effort to type and it was a strain on my hands. Whereas the Havit board is smooth, and there's a satisfying and efficient \"squish\" feel when I actuate. It's also quick in returning upward which is great for me, as I am a speed typer. No, the click is not as audible in a blue switch, but there's still that wonderful typing sound I grew up with in the '90s. I think I'll use this board when I return to work in person after the pandemic, as it's quiet enough for the office, but audible enough for the sound aesthetic. Plus, less hand strain!",

                "reviewText": "First off, I bought mine used \"Like new\". It has, however, been flawless other than a few minor blemishes.The pros:- Very responsive keys. They pop right back up and make the very typical sound of a mechanical keyboard.- The color scheme is very appealing, both functionally and aesthetically.- the keyboard layout is quite useful and doesn't leave much fat as far as useless function keys.- This keyboard is great for traveling. I occasionally bring my PC to gaming competitions and I like to show it off. This thing fits perfectly anywhere I want to store it. Anywhere my monitor could go, I could fit this thing with no issue. Unlike the older desktop keyboard that's like 8-12 inches longer I think.Cons:- There's only one dedicated delete key and it can't be used along side the number pad. It's also super awkwardly placed.- The lighting on the keys missed the mark for me. The number keys light up white to contrast the orange keys. I'd honestly wished it was a brighter orange vs the orange keys.",

I\u2019ve never used any other gaming keyboards before to compare this one to.I used to use a regular dell keyboard, but the action and click on this one is super satisfying. It has actually become a joy to type (not joking). My desk is small, so a condensed keyboard is advantageous for me.The only thing I don\u2019t like about this keyboard is that the delete key is a shared key, so you have to hold shift to use it. Keep in mind that it\u2019s fairly loud when typing compared to normal keyboards (which I like).All in all, would spend the money again in a heartbeat for this. Super easy setup, good build quality, satisfying typing.",

Es importante recalcar que es un teclado americano, por lo que no cuenta con la tecla \u00d1, sin embargo, uno puede f\u00e1cilmente configurar ambos teclados en su computadora.Estoy muy satisfecho con mi compra y recomiendo ampliamente este teclado, vale la pena invertir un poco mas de dinero, para tener un excelente teclado.",

It sounds miles better than my previous mech keyboard which was a HyperX Origins Core TKL. Both the HyperX and Havit have some version of cherry mx switches but in my opinion the Havit sounds much much better. No keyboard rattle and the other wider keycaps also have no or very little rattle. For 65 CAD it is an extremely good price. If you want to you can also buy new keycaps, but the stock PBT ones feel very nice, plus I like the colour scheme.",

The biggest culprit is the \"Enter\" key which gets activated with a mere touch and without even a soft press. Otherwise the design, the color and feel of keyboard is good with sturdy structure and on the only big drawback is low activation of the keyboard keys with minimal engagement which I would say partly go against the very spirit of a mechanical keyboard, atleast for me!",
