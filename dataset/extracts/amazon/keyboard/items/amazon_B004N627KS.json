I love this one, ,It syncs quickly with the included usb receiver it has great battery life.It uses 2 AAA batteries which I prefer to rechargable because if they die I can replace them and get back to work instead of having to stop and plug it in to recharge and having to wait. Mine usually last 7 or 8 days if I leave it on. The only bad thing about this keyboard is that the caps lock seems to turn itself on randomly.Its not a big deal to turn it back off so I still recommend the keyboard and when the time comes I'd buy this model again. It is very lightweight and compact for a full size (102 key)The keys give good feedback for a membrane (non-mechanical) keyboard making touch-typing a breeze.and its very quiet so it won't keep your roomate awake if you tend to stay up late.This keyboard has survived several drops to a hard floor without damage Compared to other wireless keyboards in this price range this is the clear winner",

                "reviewText": "This year, I've been getting more serious about my home and how I want things to be here. One of those things that I've long thought about but only recently put any real effort into is the living room \"atmosphere\". I've long had dreams of a great audio-video entertainment setup out there, and this year it all came into focus for me and I finally knew what I wanted to do. Believe it or not, this keyboard is central to that idea, though I also recently killed my desktop computer's wired keyboard, so now it's seeing use full time.Basically, my living room now has an excellent 5 speaker (two fronts, two rears and a subwoofer) sound system, and a TV wired to the secondary video output of my desktop computer. That TV is soon going to be replaced by a Vizio 32\" Smart HDTV unit, so that the computer's video will be clear enough to use properly without a magnifier application to help with reading print on-screen. That's where this keyboard comes in. I needed a wireless keyboard that could work the computer from the living room (the desktop machine is in the bedroom) without pesky signal dropout issues and thus nitpicky placement. I'm pleased to say that so far it works perfectly. I paired it up with a Logitech M510 Wireless Mouse, and though the mouse's placement is indeed a little picky, the keyboard works great. Now I can sit out there and bring up whatever I want on the computer, be it a video file, some YouTube or Amazon Instant Video entertainment, music, or my usual run of mad science research, no problemo. I can even check my bank account, pay my bills, all the usual things I do when I'm at the computer properly. Once I get the HDTV, I'll be able to do all that and more without the blurry, indistinct detail that goes with a CRT television. Skyrim in HDTV and Bose surround sound, OMG **** yes. :-)So what is this keyboard really like? Well, it's thin, it's very compact, it's very light, and it does feel a bit cheap. That said, it's got little feets in the back to prop it up at an angle, which gives the feel of a proper keyboard, and thank the Gods, it's a full, proper, keyboard layout with no sensation of the keys being scrunched together. At least, I don't notice it, and I type using just my left thumb and both index fingers WITHOUT looking at the keyboard (don't ask me how I learned to do that, but I can wing out 40WPM easy now this way), so keyboard format is EVERYTHING to me. It speaks volumes that I could go over to this thing so quickly and not immediately hate it, like how I feel about my laptop keyboard. I would NOT be hard on this thing, physically - I don't feel like it's built to be durable under abuse. I also would NEVER spill anything on it if at all possible, because surely it would be easy to kill this way and you don't want to go killing your nice wireless keyboard.I don't use mouse or keyboard software, so I can't comment on that. What I can tell you is that I really like this thing, I'm impressed by its range and I'm good with how it feels, and definitely I'd buy it again. Nice, especially if you need something super portable, reasonably compact, and very lightweight. It also has an on/off switch for those times that you want to save battery power... though I'm not sure it's really necessary. Nice keyboard!As usual, I'll come back and give an update if for whatever reason I think I need to.Rick NR417",

                "reviewText": "Edit 7/24/23: I just picked up a Logitech compact wireless mouse, M325. It did have the unifying symbol on it, and I was able to very easily sync it up with the keyboard. Took about 10 secs for it to do it.I just bought this to replace a keyboard/mouse combo I picked up at the W store about 2 years ago. It's the same model, but this is slightly different. It's white on the bottom, the keys are really quiet and seem smoother, and this one has the unifying dongle to it.My other one was not unifying, and the mouse had gone out. That's when I discovered about the \"unifying\", and so it was either pay a few more dollars for this keyboard that is unifying and buy a separate unifying mouse, or buy the same combo that isn't unifying which was on sale for 17. And seeing as if one goes out on the combo, you can't just buy another to use on the same dongle, I went this route. I figure in the long run this would be the cheaper option. I had another mouse handy that is not unifying, and it would not sync up with this keyboard.So, if you want one dongle to run both mouse and keyboard, as well as other stuff you need to look for that orange symbol on the dongle or package. Then you need to use the software on the logitech site to sync them together. IMO kinda dumb. Just make everything sync up together.Overall, decent keyboard for me for basic medium web browsing type of use, no gaming. I have the keyboard about a foot away from the monitor, and no issues with it. My old keyboard was still working ok, it just had a bunch of dust and gunk in the keys and a few keys I never use popped off and lost due to my cat digging it up for some reason. I had spilled stuff on it before, and it still worked fine. Battery had lasted, it was going on about 2 years I'd had it.",

Another was a warehouse deal, but many of the keys did not work. So I ordered this one as \"new\". What arrived as missing the factory tape, had the battery shipping protector tab removed (and laying in the box). The batteries were the same off-brand as those in the Warehouse deal, and not the Duracells that arrived in the non-Unifying version I ordered and returned.",

                "reviewText": "Make no mistake, this is what a quality keyboard is like. Keys go down with a nice sound and touch. The keyboard has a nice layout like a full sized keyboard (e.g. F<N> keys are in groups of 4 with spacing between them). And the multimedia keys are useful (and require no Function key combination, they are standalone).At the same time, the keyboard size is kept at a minimum. No unnecessary space is wasted \"around\" the keys. So the keyboard looks compact, while being full sized.Another nice touch: there's a caps lock physical LED, unlike most wireless keyboards. Super useful.I can't recommend enough. It is the second time I buy this keyboard model, for two different computers. No regrets.",
