                "reviewText": "I tried this with and without the dust shield but the keys are so flat you hit the adjacent key when typing. The board has no adjustments to improve the angle & height so that doesn't help either. Ultimately after trying for months to make it work it is being donated to the local charity. I thought this would be a great replacement for the other keyboard that I had for 8 years but it is not for me.",
