                "reviewText": "I am a touch typist and computer programmer who spends all day in front of a computer, and I'm picky about my keyboards. When my previous SIIG wireless keyboard began to get flaky, I tried a Microsoft wireless keyboard and mouse, because in the past I've always liked their design. Unfortunately, the keyboard turned out to be weird, with sunken function keys, no spacing between key groupings, and not enough tactile feedback. The mouse is excellent and I've kept that, but I've swapped the execrable keyboard for the inexpensive but nearly perfect Logitech K120.I avoided Logitech in recent years because some foolish person in their product design department decided to squish the central keypad down from 3 to 2 keys per row, so that the traditional Insert-Home-PageUp, Delete-End-PageDown that IBM taught us to love back in the '80s became three rows of Home-PageUp, END-PageDown, Insert-Delete or some such nonsense.Fortunately, it appears that Logitech came to their senses and restored the layout that customers are used to. It goes to show that a company should listen to its customers and not ram a change down everyone's throats.Anyway, the K120 has brought Logitech back to where they should be--a really good, straightforward keyboard that just works. All the keys and lights are in the right place. The keyboard is quiet, and the labeling is excellent--it's not glow-in-the-dark but the letters are large and white on black plastic so you can't go wrong. The function keys and keypads are nicely spaced and your fingers can find them without looking. The ESC key is easy to find, as well.Someone here complained about noise. Unbelievable! This keyboard is quiet. I've used quieter ones, admittedly, but this is about middle of the pack, not what I'd call a noisy keyboard at all. Try not hammering the keys like you're driving nails; you don't need to, and the keyboard (and your fingers) will last a lot longer.Someone else claimed the caps lock key was too easy to hit. Thus far, I've not hit it at all. It has just enough gap that your finger absolutely won't hit it if you're reaching for the \"A\". It just doesn't happen. I have large hands and I type very fast and so far, so good.All in all, this is a great keyboard for the money. I've bought two of them, in fact. Wireless keyboards are cool to look at, but nothing beats a traditional wired keyboard for performance and reliability.",

                "reviewText": "The Logitech Keyboard K120 is very light in weight, typical of your rubber dome technology used beneath it's keycaps. This is a standard sized keyboard, roughly 2.2cm center-to-center spacing. It has very light keytouch, so if you are elderly, or if this is for a child, then finger strength requirements are minimal.LAYOUT 5: This is the standard 104-key layout. The full-sized Backspace, Tab keys and spacebar make for familiar typing. This is somewhat of a space-saving design, with minimal ridges around the sides and bottom corners of the keyboard. If you are a lazy wrist-rest like me, then your area of your palm below your left pinky will have you executing numerous <Ctrl><Key> sequences where <Key> is any key you happened to by typing at the moment where you inadvertently held down the <Ctrl> key. Cursor controls, Home-End and Page control keys are in their normal configurations so there is nothing new to learn. LEDs are bright for the 3 lock modes, and the 10-key pad is right where you expect it to be.LOOK 5: The letters are printed with bright white lettering and numbering, so it works well in typical office lighting.DURABILITY: 4 I cannot speak for this at this time as it has been in use only for short while. The first one ordered was dead upon arrival, not working on any PC into which it was plugged. This second sample has been flawless in its operation.FEEL 3: This is a rubber dome keyboard, so keypress force is light. If you are a strong typist then you will bottom out the keys with ease, which can actually slow you down. Even the Spacebar has the same tension as all of the other keys. For light key action the return speed on the keys is fast enough to satisfy all but the fastest of typists. Return speed is still higher on full mechanical switched keyboards.SPEED 4: I type 70 WPM, so this is a fast keyboard to me. To those typing faster, say near 90 WPM, this keyboard may force you to make mistakes or skip characters. Rubber dome atop a resistor network isn't the fastest recovering keys.STABILITY 4: This isn't a rigid keyboard, and it is easily twisted. However, for everyday use it may be fine. There are the typical flip-out tabs below the front of the keyboard allowing the user to incline the board. The rubber \"feet\" strips offer plenty of grip when the keyboard is new. However, they become slipperier as the keyboard ages and picks up a coating of dust. Cleaning these feet regularly will ensure the keyboard won't slide on you.SOUND 4; This is a silent keyboard. Rubber dome technology by design is quiet. There is minimal key rattle if a key is pressed hard and quickly released. With careful typing the user can keep sound levels below (<) 60 dB and as high as 70 dB if really pounding the keys, the latter which would be rare. This keyboard is rated on quietness being a desired feature.VALUE 5: An $11+ keyboard is well worth it as compared to mechanical keyboards which can cost >$100.CONCLUSION: Enthusiastically recommended. AN $11 Logitech Keyboard K120 is excellent both for home or office use. It is quiet, fast and very affordable. I will attempt to remember to do a longevity update in a year. Thank you for reading, and I hope this review is helpful to you.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this keyboard with the corresponding silicone cover. It's great overall - and to be honest, the cover is what's keeping me from getting a higher-end gaming keyboard at the moment, as I've had my fair share of disgusting keyboards. It's not terribly loud (has some noise to it ofc, but I've dealt with louder keyboards for about half my life, so I don't mind). Probably not the best for gaming, and it's not the most ergonomic thing ever. I really, really wish there were media keys. Backlit keys would be a huge plus, since the cover makes the letters a little harder to see. Overall amazing for the price!",

There is a much appreciated soft tactile mechanical key press sound, the space bar and the bigger buttons like return, enter for calculator keys produce a kluck sound while the other a laser like mechanical klick klack that you can \"feel\". Forget chicklet keys, or other keys or digital keys on iphones or on screen keyboards that I was using while waiting for this one as my old old keyboard 90's style just went dead and I was panicking. I was looking for a value budget keyboard, I don't know about the more expensive ones, I don't need led light up buttons or other fancy gimmicks on the keyboard, I was really considering this other microsoft keyboard in the same price range, Saw a video its got a calculator function button that you press and pop goes the microsoft calculator program, but after some days thought, I dont even use computer calulators that much, and there is a sound controlling function too, but appearantly I heard it just control windows media player, forget other players. Apple has the monopoly advantage over their computer systems, and its a good thing PC's aren't that monopolistic, I don't really feel for the chicklet keys spaced out on the apple keyboards, I have a asus netbook for my mom on which I am typing this review which has the chicklet keys, the key presses are so disturbing now that I found logitec, they don't inspire as much confidence as with the logitec, or maybe that the size of the keyboard is different, the netbood being smaller less confidence bulding while the logitec a standard size brings more confidence when typing, the logitec keyboard is one workhorse of a keyboard, each key press is like a rush or tornado and continuation to other key presses is like music, I like everything about it, its sleek, low profile there is the front raise things so its not flat, in addition each key is ergonomically designed, there is the concave convex subtle element which I think adds the perfect touch, makes it interesting, and the lettering is high contrast, placement of the lettering on the individual keys is good that its not too disatracting, on my netbood the letting is smack dap on the center of each key and well now I see that it makes a difference. the logitec is not disturbing, its very pleasant to type on to look at. its a standard keyboard made for the modern computer user.",
