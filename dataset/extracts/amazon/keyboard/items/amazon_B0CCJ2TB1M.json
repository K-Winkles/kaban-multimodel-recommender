It was really easy to plug-in and it worked flawlessly. The clicking sound is very enjoyable because it\u2019s not too loud. Crazy but that was the number 1 thing I was looking for in a keyboard..a nice click sound :) It is slightly larger than the Apple keyboard with good key spacing. Actually, any keyboard is better than an Apple keyboard so I\u2019m very happy with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "This keyboard is SO COOL. I specifically bought this to chat on my Nintendo Switch. Some NS games don't have an online chat or chat on the NS app (example: Among Us) and someone told me a USB keyboard would work by plugging it into the NS console since there's a USB port open on it. It was as easy as plugging it right in to the console to use it, didn't have to do anything else! I was looking for a back lit keyboard, and behold, Amazon had this beauty. I LOVE the white with the rainbow back lights. Even the lettering on the keys are white, which makes the light shine through them better and you can see the letters easier than if they were black letters/keys. It's such a unique keyboard, I really like how the keys are raised up high too. You can switch off the back lights by pressing the key that looks like a sun. The keyboard also has little kick stands underneath towards the top, which would come in handy for PC or on a desktop or whatever. It feels like it's really good quality, and the price was AMAZING for a gem such as this, even got same day delivery!The USB is about average length, which I actually wish was a bit longer, but that's just for my specific needs, & that's an easy/cheap replacement if I decide to do so later. Just wanted to mention that incase anyone is using it and needs some length.",

It is not an actual mechanical keyboard but it has the feeling of one. It will take some getting used to when you first use it if you have been using s standard keyboard because the keys on here are a bit taller. I dont play as much games on my computer as you might but when I do play games for a long time my hands dont cramp as fast as they did on my other keyboard and your hands can type comfortably. The color didn't match my desk how I would've liked it so I got a similar black model from the same company. Overall this keyboard is very comfortable and it has a nice sleek clean design.",

I have had it for a year and a half now and it still works like new. \u201cThe wasd\u201d keys have rubbed off but that\u2019s to be expected when you use them for hours almost everyday. I\u2019ve never had an issue with any keys sticking or breaking and the lights still work perfectly! I suggest this keyboard to everyone I know that\u2019s looking for one! It\u2019s really great and still looks so good!",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Good lighted keyboard for the price - lasts 5 months",
                "reviewText": "Update (January, 2019): After three months, the white coloring on the keys began to wear away, so certain letters the ones most used of course - E, R, T, I, O, A, S, L, C, N, Shift, and Return) became round splotches instead of letters. After 5 months, the lights got stuck in flash mode (won't turn off, or stay on in steady mode). So just know that while this is a cool looking keyboard at a reasonable price, it does not last long.Previous review (purchased in August, 2018):Looks great all lit up, and on this one, the light actually shows through the letters, numbers, and symbols on the key-tops so you can use it in the dark if you're not a touch-typist. You can't adjust the colors unfortunately - what you get is a rainbow of sorts and that's it. But it's a pretty rainbow - the star of the show is the right side (purple and blue). A bit loud (clackety-clack), but that doesn't bother me too much. I assume it would bother others though, so this is best for a private office space. Oher issues - the numbers lock doesn't light up on mine (not the end of the world because it only takes a millisecond to tell if your numbers are working). Conversely, the caps lock does light up, but needs to be clicked more than once sometimes to get it to engage. So no, it's not perfect, but as mentioned in the title, a good lighted keyboard for the price. (To turn the lights on or off, just press the key to the right of Fn. To make them blink (\"breathe\" mode), hold down the Fn key, while pressing the key to its right.)",
