                "reviewText": "TL;DR: Budget-friendly keyboard, satisfying key feel, enjoyable typing sound, ideal size, highly recommend for personal use or as a gift.I stumbled upon this keyboard, and it's a real gem considering its affordability. It's a no-frills, straightforward keyboard, but don't let its simplicity fool you \u2013 it's a delight to use. The keys have this pleasing tactile feel that makes typing not just a task but a tiny joy. Each keystroke produces a subtle, satisfying click that's music to the ears of anyone who appreciates the sensory aspect of typing.The size is just right too \u2013 not too bulky, yet not uncomfortably compact. It hits the sweet spot between functionality and space efficiency. Given its impressive features and wallet-friendly price, I wholeheartedly recommend this keyboard. It's not only a great choice for personal use but also an ideal gift for anyone in need of a quality keyboard without breaking the bank.",

                "reviewText": "My new computer was not compatible with my old mouse and keyboard, so here I am. I am very pleased with Logitech and have used their products countless times, and these did not fail to disappoint. Getting not just a keyboard but also a mouse all for this low price? That's practically a steal.Both work flawlessly for daily activities, mild gaming, and even working remotely from home. I have no complaints there and could not be more pleased. I personally am not a fan of wireless devices, so it is very nice to have a wired keyboard and mouse, both of which have a decent length of wire.If you are thinking of using these for intense gaming, though, think again. My boyfriend has recently gotten me into MOBA games like League of Legends. The keyboard is able to handle it fairly well without much noticeable issue. The mouse, however, sucks. This kind of mouse is NOT designed for rapid clicking, and so you have a lot of \"I swear I clicked the button 50 times but the ability I was trying to do did not go off because the computer could not recognize the mouse click in time\". I have also had quite a few video game characters die because I was trying to click to get my character to run, but the click just never registered, leaving my character to be attacked defenselessly. So you CAN play them, but you won't play them as well as you'd like with this mouse.I ended up buying two different mouses, including a low-cost gaming mouse that is also from Logitech, and the verdict is that you can't cheap out on a gaming mouse. If you plan to do any kind of intense gaming, you are going to need one of those heavy, ugly gaming mouses that cost upwards of $40. There's just no avoiding it.In short, heavy gaming is out, but simple games like Bloons, Minecraft, XCOM, and even Portal will work fine. Despite my angry, rapid clicking, the mouse also still functions perfectly well for non-gaming purposes including 8 hours of remote work 5 days a week. The mouse is lightweight and durable, and the keyboard has been able to withstand everything I throw at it from Amazon review essays to heavy gaming to a kitten who just loves to sleep on keyboards. The cord length is great, the keyboard buttons never stick, the mouse has a nice quiet click, and the price is fantastic.10/10, would buy again for anything other than heavy gaming purposes, and even then I'd still get the keyboard for heavy gaming (just not the mouse)",

                "reviewTitle": "The best KB/M set on a budget?",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Just can't go wrong with this keyboard and mouse. Nice and quiet for when your mechanical keyboard strains the relationship with others within earshot (the main reason for this purchase).Keyboard:It's a(n almost) standard layout membrane/dome keyboard. The keys feel the same as membrane keyboards from Logitech's past lines (I believe it's entirely ABS plastic). Normal keys feel good with a nice amount of travel. Larger keys, Numpad \"Enter\", \"Shift\", etc, are 'clacky' when tapped as the dome membranes don't put upward pressure on them (and there is more movement tolerance in the clips that hold the key stem to prevent binding). The only key that would be of concern would be the space bar but, thankfully in this case, the space bar is pretty good (slightly louder if depressed from the left side/by the left thumb vs the quieter side, right thumb). I don't use the riser, but they seem adequate.My only negative thing to say about the keyboard (relatively for what this keyboard is and the value proposition it represents) is that the \"Esc\" key is offset to the right by one-half key to accommodate the strange Function key spacing between groupings (i.e.: \"Esc\"-F1, F4-F5, etc). I can see why they designed the layout this way (I assume to reduce the distance for the left hand to travel to depress \"Esc\") but I prefer to hit \"Esc\" by indexing my left hand off the furthest keys on the left hand side. Not sure why having \"Esc\", Tilde, Tab, Caps Lock, etc, lined up on the left was something Logitech wasn't willing to do.Mouse:The mouse feels good for a budget mouse. It's certainly better than most OEM mice that come with packaged systems. I have average (M) hands and it feels comfortable in a relaxed grip or in a high palm grip. It's symmetrical, so it feels just as comfortable with my left as it does with my right hand. It feels solid (with a nice weight to it) and there is no lateral flex (from at least what a hand can apply). The sensor seems to be able to work on most surfaces I've used it on so far (bed, couch, melamine, wood, normal household surfaces). The L/R clicks feel good with a very slight amount of good sponge and aren't very loud (they feel like Omron switches, but I'm not curious enough to open this up). The middle mouse click appears to be as deep in travel as the L/R clicks but significantly firmer (which is good).I was initially concerned with the \"gritty\" or \"crunchy\" feedback when using the wheel but it has since worn in over a day of use. You can definitely feel when you've moved index to index when scrolling, which is good.Overall, it's a great budget keyboard and mouse set. You should pay no more than CAD$20. If none of the offers here look good (remember shipping costs add up), Walmarts in Canada stock this for CAD$19.99 (as of the writing of this review).(Video was meant to demonstrate the sound of the keycaps, please try to ignore the lack of proper focus)UPDATE: A year on, the set is still plucking away just fine. The mouse has developed a little play on the top plastic (about 1 mm of slop rearward). Other than that, the keys haven't polished themselves into mirrors nor have the cables burst into a rat's nest. Excellent!",
