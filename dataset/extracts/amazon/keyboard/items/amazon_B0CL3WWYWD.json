Initially the connection from the USB connector was choppy and had a lot a dead zones. Make sure you try all USB ports on your device before returning. After moving to a USB 3.0 port (not sure if this type is specifically needed) it worked perfectly. No choppiness, lag or dead zones after hours of use. Also worked from other side of my room, approximately 10 feet away.",

Also, the fact that it is a wired charge rather than batteries. The only caveat is that the mouse DOES NOT work on all surfaces. I have a black glass top desk and the mouse will not work without something underneath it.",

I'm blind without my glasses so I wish the letters and numbers were larger on the keyboard, it tool me forever to find the FN button to change the colors and brightness but other than that, it's great!",

I am glad I had the opportunity to really see what the keyboard should perform like.. much better the second time around thank you",

I\u2019m really glad I chose this combo. And the color is unique. I\u2019ve gotten many compliments from my co-workers when they walk by and have shared the link with them.",
