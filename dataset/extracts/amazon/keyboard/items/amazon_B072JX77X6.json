                "reviewText": "Well-made and responsive; a great bargain for a general-purpose mouse and keyboard set, with phenomenal battery life and a good keyboard feel. However, definitely not a keyboard for gaming, as the action is a common membrane keyboard action and not a microswitch-based keyboard; also, you should never game with a wireless mouse and keyboard due to lag. Lag that's unnoticeable in a wireless keyboard/mouse combo for general use can be very problematic when gaming. It also has an impressively long range; I've used one to do presentations where the keyboard/mouse was at least 20-25 feet from the receiver on the PC. One last note: Be very careful unpacking your new mouse and keyboard combo, as Logitech can't seem to decide where to put the all-important wireless receiver. Some models hide it in the mouse (a black, unmarked nub inside a black mouse, where it all blends together), others under the liner in the box, while some put it in a little sleeve next to the keyboard. Very easy to miss and accidentally throw away.",

The mouse was not following, and the keys would either type additional letters or leave off letters. There were no instructions, or troubleshooting advice. I turned to Youtube for help. There were several ideas mentioned. The one that worked for me was to move the small plugin to another port. So far so good.",

They sent me another set and though the mouse wheel is still a bit noisy the keyboard and mouse both work as they should.Edit Feb 17/21: The keyboard started lagging and/or not working at all intermittently after a month, and the mouse occasionally lags now but the scroll wheel has gotten quieter and more responsive. After trying every tip and troubleshoot possible I've found nothing that fixed the keyboard issue and it had been very frustrating to try to use it since it typed nothing much of the time. As of today the keyboard has stopped working at all and I'm using my ancient keyboard to type. I've bought Logitech products for many years and recommended them to everyone, until now. I would not recommend this set, there are now many bad reviews online and the intermittent issue is very common.Original review: Bought this set to replace my 10+yr old Logitech set. The keys are quite loud and feel a bit loose and the plastic housing feels cheaper than the old one, but it's laid out well and I like a full size keyboard. The mouse is also quite loud, especially the scroll wheel, and feels less well made than the old one. Everything works, but I've only had it a day so can't speak to longevity",
