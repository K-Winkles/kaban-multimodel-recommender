Well, my wired keyboard started to fail, so I finally had the reason to buy this one. I'd like to go back in time and slap myself very hard now.This is worth more than the 20 bucks I gave for it. Probably worth about twice as much. It's just a nice basic keyboard with a few extras I didn't have on my old basic one; see it's top row.So nice to set it on my lap and not having to screw with a wire anymore. If you're looking for just a decent, basic wireless keyboard, this things great! Simple and clean without wires. Working fantastic.",

It occurred to me how I love them today so I decided to find my order on Amazon to write a review. Part of why I love them so much is very reasonable the price. The keyboard and mouse both have a switch on them to preserve battery life which makes needing to replace batteries to, well so long I have no idea. The main system I use has monitors off to the side of a recliner in the living room so a wireless system makes a keyboard in the lap and mouse on the arm of the chair convenient. But even for desk situations I don't want to deal with yet more wires.",

                "reviewText": "I recently acquired the Logitech MK270 Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo, and overall, it's been a fantastic addition to my workspace.Efficient Wireless Connectivity:The wireless connectivity of both the keyboard and mouse is seamless and efficient. I appreciate the freedom it provides, eliminating the hassle of tangled cords and offering flexibility in positioning.Responsive Keyboard:The keyboard is impressively responsive, with well-spaced keys that make typing a breeze. The tactile feedback adds to the typing experience, and I find myself typing with increased accuracy and speed.Long Battery Life:One of the standout features is the impressive battery life. The combo seems to be incredibly power-efficient, sparing me the constant need for battery replacements. It's a small detail that contributes to the overall convenience.Tiny Mouse Nitpick:My only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that the mouse is rather small. While it doesn't hinder its functionality, those with larger hands might find it a bit petite. However, this is a personal preference, and the mouse still performs admirably in terms of responsiveness and precision.Compact Design:The compact design of both the keyboard and mouse is a plus for those with limited desk space. The combo strikes a balance between functionality and space efficiency, making it suitable for various setups.Overall Impression:In conclusion, the Logitech MK270 Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo is an excellent choice for those seeking a reliable and affordable solution. The efficient wireless connectivity, responsive keyboard, and long battery life outweigh the minor nitpick about the size of the mouse. It's a combo that delivers on both performance and convenience.Rating: \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",
