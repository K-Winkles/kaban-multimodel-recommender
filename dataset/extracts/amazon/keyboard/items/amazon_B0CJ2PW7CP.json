                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I took a chance and I picked up this this Royal Kludge R75 keyboard (brown switches) during Cyber Monday at a steep discount, not expecting much. There were literally zero reviews/ratings on Amazon for this at the time, so I knew I was rolling the dice. However, I needed a small form factor keyboard that included a dedicated delete key, arrow keys, and a volume knob, and this seemed to fit the bill as there's not a lot of options that have all four of the features I wanted. I figured it would be a piece of junk, but I was quite mistaken.Despite the rather weird company name (I guess nobody in their PR/marketing department checked what \"Kludge\" means in English, LOL) this turned out to be a great purchase. The typing experience is smooth, and it is the quietest mechanical keyboard I've ever typed on, especially considering it doesn't have any of those rubber silencer rings around the keystems. The loud 'clack' noise when you bottom out a key, and the reverberating 'ping' sound so common to mechanical keyboards, is entirely absent. I imagine that the keyboard would be almost dead silent if you put on those silencer rings. I posted a video so you could hear the sound of the keypresses. It doesn't do the keyboard justice, it sounds louder in the video than it really is. Trust me, the thing is very quiet.One nice thing is that it comes with a removable dust cover made of clear plastic. Rather handy, it will most definitely reduce the need for me to clean the keyboard over time.To be clear I've only been using it for a few days so I can't speak as to its longevity at this point, but this thing feels solidly built and I'm very satisfied with the purchase. In fact, even if I paid full price rather than getting it at a discount, I'd still be very satisfied. If you're looking for a solidly built compact keyboard that still has dedicated delete and arrow keys, with a rather unique, quiet sound profile, this is what you're looking for.",

                "reviewText": "This was the first mechanical keyboard I ever bought. It was well worth the $60 on sale. The keycaps feel great, the switches feel good and aren't too loud, and the overall build quality is very nice. Volume knob doesn't feel cheap. My only \"complaint\" is that the software for this keyboard is unavailable on their website. You have to download it through the Google Drive link in the Amazon description. Kind of weird, but it's legit. 5 stars and worth the purchase.",

For sure rivaling much more expensive keyboards, just much cheaper. Build quality is solid, and the media knob is a great added benefit to make volume control easy and fast. Not my first purchase from RK and definitely won\u2019t be my last.",

                "reviewText": "I am not unhappy with this product, not happy either. I wanted a replacement keyboard with much more tactile feeling than the traditional keyboards. As I use this in a multi-person office, I also wanted something that would be easy to connect/disconnect for flexibility.Does it work fine? Yes. On the other hand, it is not a keyboard that I like the feel of. I feel like I need to be even more heavy-fingered than I am. I actually kind of pound on my keyboard now, so me saying that is somewhat telling.The look is nice, and I am happy with the colors and lighting. It stands out among the other drab office stuff most people have here. The key travel is good, the sound satisfying, but I just don't feel as smooth on this as I do other keyboards that I possess.",

                "reviewText": "Overall this is a solid keyboard if you do absolutely no mods / changes to it and I'll explain why...If you order the black version of this keyboard your only option is the brown switches which honestly just sound really bad and are the same switches I had from my previous Royal Kludge keyboard which I immediately swapped for some clear Akko's. I've opened up this keyboard several times at this point and comes with some prebuilt mods which are really nice. I ended up filling as much polyfoam as I can into the case (not much space inside) and masking tape on the back of the PCB. I also swapped out the switches with Gateron Yellows and now the keyboard sounds super thocky.My main issue is that I ordered an expensive set of custom keycaps and didn't realize that the right Shift is a custom size unique to this specific keyboard so no keycaps you order will ever fit the right shift key slot. Every other key cap fits except the space bar. For some reason my space bar from my previous RK doesn't fit properly and rubs against the case mount even though they're the same exact size, the custom space bar I have from the new set just gets stuck pressed down, and because I'm running custom keycaps the space bar that came with this keyboard is rubbing against the other keycaps. So now I have to use some random spacebar and the original right shift key with my beautiful custom keycap set which is such a shame.I'm going to give it another week or so before I decide on returning this keyboard and ordering something that allows for what I want to do and the look I'm going for. It's unfortunate as I already spent countless hours messing with this keyboard.Only get this keyboard if you never plan to open it or swap keycaps or switches.",
