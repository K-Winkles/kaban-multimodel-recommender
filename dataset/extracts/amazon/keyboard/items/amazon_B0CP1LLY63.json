The full-sized split keyboard with a wrist rest is a good added feature for extended typing sessions, providing comfort and support. The adjustable DPI on the mouse adds versatility, catering to different preferences. The sleek black design adds a touch of sophistication to my workspace. Overall, a fantastic combo for anyone seeking comfort, functionality, and a stylish addition to their PC setup.Setting up is a breeze, and the connection remains stable without any issues. I've experimented with iClever, Arteck, and Logitech multi-device keyboards, but none met my satisfaction. I specifically sought a full-sized keyboard, and Arteck's connectivity was notably poor.The only aspect I'm not particularly fond of is the very soft key press. It would be fantastic if there were some tactile response for feedback or, at the very least, a clicking sound.",

This is the first time using a mouse like this and it is so much more comfortable to use.Only downsides are the mouse occasionally disconnects for no reason and it's a bit of a challenge to get it going again and I cannot seem to find a print screen button for taking screen shots for work. It has a button for everything else but that.",

I liked the feel of the mouse and the verticle design but it's not keeping its charge. I have to keep it plugged in with the provided charging cord.The keyboard set up is fine. I like the split design. My issue with the keyboard is that the delete button is small. I was previously using a keyboard that had a large delete button so im trying to get used to a small delete button.I contacted support regarding the mouse and the only solution was to return the keyboard and mouse. Too bad because I liked this set but now I'm unsure if I should get another or try a different brand.",
