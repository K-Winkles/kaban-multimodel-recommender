I type fast too so it just made a bunch of racket and draws too much attention as I work with a lot of people in the same room. This keyboard made a HUGE difference and feels nice to type on. Connecting was super easy and within minutes, I was able to start working! Very easy to clean too and I love how light it is.",

                "reviewText": "This keyboard is exactly as advertised and is fantastic for the price point. It is quiet, sleek, and very functional. The selling point for me was the additional volume / music control buttons, and the calculator button. I could not find all of those on any other \"quiet\" keyboard in this price range. The only con is that it feels like the keys are a bit too close together. My fingers tend to graze the edge of other keys somewhat frequently, a \"problem\" I've never experienced on another keyboard. I think generally on these chiclet keyboards the keys themselves are spaced a little further apart. Regardless, it is still a 5-star product due to its layout and quietness.",
