                "reviewText": "This keyboard & mouse combo was very easy to plug & play with my PC Laptop. Both are very comfortable to use, although the keyboard takes just a little getting used to if you're accustomed to a standard keyboard. The only thing I miss from my previous keyboard (also Logitech, different model) is the Caps Lock light that it had and this one does not. I use these for CAD drafting and often toggle the caps lock for text. But otherwise give it an A+.",

                "reviewText": "I never thought much about my keyboard so my last one lasted about 10 years. Every so often I had to shake it upside down with dust and crumbs. It finally died and I decided to get one that was more comfortable for my wrists. I knew enough people suffering from carpel tunnel syndrome, and I didn't want to risk it.This one came with equal good and bad comments, but I decided to give it a shot. I couldn't believe the difference from my last one. My wrists now lay comfortably on the bottom of the keyboard while I'm typing, and it's much more comfortable. Even the mouse is a great change. I was so used to scrolling slowly from my last mouse, but this one allows to speed through those sites that have so much junk ads to get through. This just speeds you through that stuff to where you want to go.I presets are great to where you can adjust your computer volume. I know there are plenty that do this, but I had my last keyboard for a decade so many things have changed, and it's still very exciting. Some have complained that the keys feel cheap, but I don't understand that part at all. Everything on the keyboard feels very sturdy, and I've had this one for nearly six months now with no issues at all.The mouse fits comfortable in your hand with side clicks so you can move page to page rather than scrolling. If you don't think keyboards are different, you need to try this puppy out and you will see (and feel) the difference.",

                "reviewText": "You can see in the pics that the box was all beat up, retaped, and they clearly cut what was probably the return shipping labels from it. I ordered it new, so I'm kind of upset I paid the new price, but that didn't affect the rating.The keyboard itself is pretty nice. Wrist pad is better than none, feels ergonomic, the 'wave' doesn't take that long to get used to, buttons have a nice snap to them (just the right amount of 'click' for me); Definitely an upgrade from my stock keyboard.The mouse (the M705), on the other hand, is one I already had, but as you can see from the pic, they have since reworked it to be cheaper. No color on the battery cover, arrow buttons, or scroll button (Not a big deal). Switch feels worse (harder to press), which stinks because I turn it on/off all the time. The optical sensor no longer says performance, so I don't know if they actually changed that (I don't do anything precise enough to tell). Lastly, the bottom nubs are just regular plastic, which does make it feel different on my mouse pad compared to my old one. Maybe it's mostly cosmetic, but just wanted to let people know in case they specifically wanted a replacement for their old M705.",
