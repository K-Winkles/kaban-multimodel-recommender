The LED backlit keys are adjustable in brightness which is a cool feature. The cover is metal, a great feature at this price. The only nit picky thing is the LEDs only have 3 functions for the style/ pattern, a bummer. The mouse has LEDs too, it tracks very well and no lag. I recommend this keyboard.",

I have PTSD from combat in Vietnam and get no pleasure from reliving any of that. I ordered this because I'm old school and love the sound of the keys being struck as well as the beautiful lights around and on the item. I ordered a keyboard like this a few years ago but couldn't get it to work with my iMac. This one has full function although it took a while to figure out some details. I highly recommend it because it makes me smile when I see the colorful glow. The only drawback is the font on the keys. They are hard for me to read occasionally. I'm a good typist but somehow forgot where some of the keys are located due to insufficient memory at this time. Buy it...you'll like it.",

The phone holder is cool and will add a convenience not on other keyboards. My only issue is a missing key on shipment... I wish I could simply get a key sent to me, but it seems I'll have to get a complete new combo set and return this one. Kind of a pain if they could just send a key instead, but OK. Will comment on customer support after I deal with this issue.",

Wired so I never have to worry about batteries or lag. Mouse is very precise and has a button to change the sensitivity. The two buttons also are great for WoW since I can bind them to certain spells. Im so glad I didnt spend a ton of money on an expensive keyboard. Plus I dont have to be gentle with it or worry about getting food on it or brekaing it etc bc I can just order another for $20 lol. Def reccommened this.",

It's not a plastic piece of junk, it's metal and SOLID. Looks beautiful. I've seen better looking keys, color-wise, but this, I think, will stand the test of time. Overall it feels rugged, sturdy, and has great looks. Comes with a phone holder, which is nice, but I am unlikely to use. The mouse is nice too, has breathing colors and a nice design. The best part? The scroll wheel feels so solid when I roll it, I'm sure it will last as long as I need it to. All-in-all highly recommend.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Nice keyboard, MIld buyer's remorse",
                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the latest generation of this keyboard with colorful RGB LED lights and a decent design. It has two brightness levels and can be turned off, which is a nice feature. However, I found that the keys are only illuminated nicely from below, and the actual lettering doesn't help much in recognizing the keys from any angle other than directly above. From any casual angle, the keys are practically illegible.In my experience, this keyboard is not the best option for someone who needs a reliable and functional keyboard. The keys are not very visible, and it's difficult to type on it without looking directly at the keys. I also found that the keyboard is not very durable. Unfortunately, I spilled a small amount of liquid on it, and it no longer functions as a keyboard. The keys got stuck, and it's essentially just a pretty light now.If you're looking for a keyboard with colorful LED lights and a unique design, this keyboard might be worth considering. However,if you need a reliable and functional keyboard for work or gaming, I would recommend looking for other options.On the positive side, the keyboard has an unfinished or industrial, deconstructed look and feel, which is cool and unique. It would be perfect for kids' computers or if used in a proper school desk. The two brightness levels and the ability to turn off the LED lights are also nice features.In conclusion, while the latest generation of this keyboard has some nice features, it's not the best option for someone who needs a reliable and functional keyboard. The keys are not very visible, and it's not very durable. If you're looking for a keyboard with a unique design and colorful LED lights, this keyboard might be a good option. However, if you need a reliable and functional keyboard for work or gaming, I would recommend looking for other options.",

Good for typing, email, work. very comfortable, so far workng ok. I do not care about themes, or moving lights etc, so I don't even know if such features are present or not. I am using this as a lighted KB in a dark area. My older KB was a Dell or something and not lights, I could not see keys, when the light changes, clouds go over and I am trying to save electricity and having lower / less lighting in the room. The mouse is good too, that was just extra, I did not need it but works smooth, size is hefty but still comfortable, and response is good. So far so good. I have another (mechanical) Aula KB also, and that is why I bought the same brand.",

Excellent budget value for the price.Mouse PRO's:-Smooth, responsive.-comfortable size and shape.-Side buttons are handy.-DPI toggle button works well.-Light pattern can be swapped from multi-colour/single-colour/off [SideButton+DP]Keyboard CON's:-Blinking patterns are terrible and look horrendous. [Fn+1 to Disable them]-Only two blinking patterns and they're both awful.-Unlike the cellphone holder, the Penholder is too thin and pens can't stand up in it. They just slide out and fall over. I had to put a bottlecap on the desk under mine so the pens can stay standing.Mouse CON's:-RGB lights on the mouse are even worse. [Can disable with SideButton+DPI]-Only 1 pattern and it looks awful. Just pulses colours on and off in sequence.-Option to select a single colour for the pulsing pattern but it looks just as bad.-No option for solid lights like with the keyboard.-No instructions for special mouse light modes.Overall this is a functional, nice looking, solid value keyboard for the price. I will probably use a different mouse though. One star removed for a lack of better light options but I'm otherwise very happy with mine!",
