                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic Keyboard at a High Price!",
                "reviewText": "This is a super nice keyboard at a super high price.It met all the feature criteria I had: Highly configurable RGB, dedicated media control keys, wrist rest, replaceable mechanical keys, and double-shot key caps that will hold up to years of use.I chose the Asus \"NX Brown\" switches. I would have preferred Cherry MX switches, which Asus says will eventually be available pre-installed, but I decided not to wait. And I have to say, the Asus NX Brown are very nice and nearly indistinguishable from the Cherry MX Brown switches. They actuate smoothly, with no wobble, including the space bar -- which smoothly moves straight down even when pressed at the very end.The keycaps have a slight texture, and legends are molded into the keys (\"double-shot\" injection molding) rather than surface-printed. The switches are replaceable and interchangeable with Asus NX or Cherry MX, so mixing and matching switches is possible if desired. It is nice to know that if a switch fails, I can just pop it off and pop a new one on.Typing on this keyboard is enjoyable. As a fast touch typist (120-130 wpm), I found the feel and sound to be just about perfect. Asus has employed internal foam to prevent vibrations, which results in each keystroke making a distinct sound without any of the echo or \"buzz\" that many keyboards have. Keycaps are dished, making it easy to maintain correct finger alignment over the keys.Ultra-fast polling rates up to 8000Hz are supported, though I was unable to tell any difference above 2000Hz. Dedicated gamers may find these high rates beneficial, though.I will likely never use the dot-matrix \"AniME Matrix\" display at the upper right corner. I find it distracting and have disabled it. That said, it works well - though the LEDs are white, not RGB. Asus provides several pre-made animations via the Armoury Crate control software, and also a web-based editing tool for those who want to create their own animations.The dedicated media controls also work well. The one detractor here is the \"mute\" function, which requires carefully pressing straight down on the roller-bar volume control -- sort of like one of those log-rolling contests at the county fair, it takes some practice to push down without rolling.The keyboard is supported by (4) non-skid feet and has the typical flip-out risers under the top edge to give the keyboard a slight slope. A cushioned wrist rest is included, which has lighting pass-through for the LEDs along the bottom edge (nice design!). The pad is comfortable and easy to attach or detach via built-in magnets.A single USB pass-through port is provided along the top edge. It is a bit disappointing that this is limited to USB2; at this price point, Asus could have easily made the pass-through USB3. But most people already have access to USB3 ports on the front panel or edge bezel of their PC.RGB control, including special modes like \"rainbow\", \"reactive\", and \"ripple\" are available via the Armoury Crate software, which can also synchronize lighting modes with other Asus Aura lighting effects for Asus motherboards, RGB strips, video cards, and so forth. Like the matrix display, I find most of these a bit distracting -- but the effects are flexible, control is granular, and it all works well.Keyboard macros can be created \"on the fly\" via the keyboard alone, without any extra software, or can be created via the Armoury Crate software.Overall, this is a super nice, high-quality keyboard with a ton of features and flexibility. The price is tough to swallow, but the combination of quality and features is hard to find anywhere else.",

                "reviewText": "First I'll give you the only negative points of this keyboard.1. The cord is super fatboy. Yes, it has a passthrough USB which is great but the wire is so darn thick and not the most flexible so aesthetically it's not my favorite.2. The Asus RGB software is a little wonky. Upon starting my computer, the animate and color settings don't always load correctly and at least 50% of the time I have to quickly open crate to reload my settings. Not my favorite.As for the positive?1. This keyboard is an absolute dream to type on. I opted for the brown switches as I prefer the extra tactile feel and these are honestly amazing. Very nice sound deadening. The response is instantaneous. The wristpad clips on oh so nicely and just makes for an ultra comfortable typing experience. I have several other nice keyboards and they honestly feel like crap after using this one.2. The lighting is vibrant has all your standard RGB effects and settings. The lighting from the bottom of the wristpad is a nice touch.3. Love the scrollwheel. One of the best on the market.4. Fit and finish is just top notch. Very solid and beautiful looking keyboard.5. The animate matrix is a little gimmicky but it's fun at times. Because it's just white lit pixels it doesn't look incredibly clear so bigger less complicated designs look better.Overall I would highly recommend this keyboard. Yes, it's pricey but the quality is worth it. If it came in white and had a slightly less thick cord (or was wireless) it would be probably my perfect keyboard, but overall this is pretty close. No regrets at all on purchase.",

Las teclas (siendo PBT) son de una calidad excelente, la textura ayuda mucho al agarre de cada yema y se ve que van a durar bastante, parecen de metal/aluminio.Visualmente es hermoso (aunque al final cada gusto es diferente), tanto en la parte de RGB como en los materiales, colores y pues claro, lo que distingue el teclado de los otros, la parte de puntos de led (Animate de ASUS) donde se pueden poner bastantes cosas, algunas est\u00e9ticas y otras bastante \u00fatiles como el porcentaje de la bater\u00eda, la hora, y pues un sin fin de cosas m\u00e1s.El \u00fanico \"con\" que le puedo encontrar es un poco en la almohadilla para las mu\u00f1ecas, no en la parte visual o est\u00e9tica, m\u00e1s bien siento que le falta un poco m\u00e1s de relleno para que los que tenemos manos algo pesadas no se sienta el fondo, pero esto para nada afecta mi opini\u00f3n en general de que es un impresionante y excelente teclado en los apartados comerciales.",
