                "reviewText": "Bought it on sale for $59.49 as a gift for a family member, a lot of nice features on it for that price. These were my first keycaps that have a little grit to them and surprisingly felt nice to type on. The prelubed keyboard switches feel more shallow than other keyswitches that I have tried but regardless, were smooth and and sound nice. The modifier keys also have little to no ticking from the stabilizers, which was a surprise considering other keyboards that I have bought from other vendors have had serious problems with ticking from their stabilizers. I was also surprised that there was no case ping with my unit. My only complaint with the keyboard would be that the case feels cheap, but for the previously mentioned sale price on top of the keyboard not really needing any modifications, it's an excellent keyboard to gift to someone.",

The price is insanely nice for the quality you get. Yes it\u2019s plastic base, but if you even attempt to build it yourself you\u2019ll be in over $200.This thing sounds great, feels sturdy and the art is good quality.Give it a try, you will not be disappointed.And to the company \u2014 keep up the amazing work and great pricing. Thank you.",

After having this keyboard for a few weeks now, I will say that I will be using this as my main keyboard for the foreseeable future. My only gripe is that the rgb lights of the keyboard do not go through the keys making it hard to see in dark rooms especially with the dark Keys' color. Other than that I am very satisfied with my purchase!",

                "reviewText": "I was a bit skeptical of this keyboard at first as there were no reviews for this model and for everything it offered for the price it seemed too good, that there had to be some shortcuts, however this keyboard has surprised me in every way and I'm glad I took the chance on this.Not only does the keyboard sound, feel and look amazing but the build quality is top notch too. While the housing is plastic so it's a bit lighter than other mechanical keyboards it still feels sturdy and I imagine it's how they can easily get the artwork on there which is phenomenal in quality. Even with this base they still managed to make it sound great, the switches and stabs feel like they're properly lubed with good enough dampening too with no pinging noise from what I can tell. And best of all the switches are hot swappable with either 5 or 3 pin switches!!The software for this keyboard is some of the best I've used as well. It offers the typical RGB customization for multiple effects (including audio spectrum), options to upload gifs to the little screen, and probably my favorite section that lets you customize literally any key you want; to do whatever you want: from media controls to making it do macros, to being a different key entirely. I was able to bind fn+shift to be print screen which is great since I use that key all the time.As for the screen.. it's alright really. The viewing angles aren't great but being able to have a little gif playing on your keyboard is kinda neat.My only personal gripe is the positioning of the arrow keys but it has grown on me a little.Overall this has been hands down the best keyboard I've had and I would easily recommend this keyboard if it suits your style.",
