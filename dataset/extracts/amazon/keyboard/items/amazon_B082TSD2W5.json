                "reviewText": "When paired with the MX Master 3 mouse for MAC you have a great tool for your home office. These are great productivity tools for a streamlined workflow. Fairly easy to set up. I have the set configured to control my MAC M1 2020, my iPad Air 4 and my employee Win/Intel PC. The switching has been working perfectly so far, I have been using them for the 2nd day now. Though it's too soon to comment on battery life, the lighted keys are so cool. With the proximity sensors all you have to do is move your hands towards the keys and they light up if the keyboard senses a lack of a certain amount of light.. Very accurate and cool. Pushing the the F13, F14 and F15 buttons instantly move your keyboard to the device. Pushing the channel button on the mouse does the same.I did not and will not set up and configure \"Flow\" between my Mac and Win PC. It would violate my IT data security rules around sharing documents between a confidential work machine in my case Healthcare data and a private machine. A no no. However, I can easily bounce back and forth throughout the day as I need to address an email or Skype. And bounce back and view a YouTube on my Mac.I know there have been some concerns around Bluetooth and Mac M1 machines. So far I have not had any issues. I use Bluetooth on my Mac and use the dongle on my Windows PC for the connections.The touch and feel of the keyboard is AMAZING! The keys just float to your touch. I am a pretty fast typer but this keyboard definitely speeds up my typing without sacrificing accuracy. Similarly, the mouse fits beautifully in your palm. Initially the tendency is to grip the mouse hard, I thing because of all the functional buttons. But as I get more comfortable and used to the mouse and trust my movements, I find it takes very little effort to access all the controls. As I get more time with the combo I see my productivity getting better and better already. Plus the feature and tech of this combo is super cool. Plus plus it's $60 cheaper that the way overpriced and no lit key'd Apple full keyboard. I would totally recommend both the mouse and the keyboard to a friend. If you're on the fence just buy it. I know, it's kind of pricy ($200) for keyboard and mouse. But it's worth it and the quality should last.",

This keyboard is great, the keys are very ergonomic and I find myself making fewer typos on this one (I find the spacing between keys perfects for my hands). As with most Logi products the app integration allows for custom keybinds and I love the level of control that gives me. My favorite part about this keyboard is the backlit keys. It's super useful at night when I'm watching YouTube videos and reach out, and my keys light up so I can hit the right one. It's something I didn't know I needed in a keyboard but it's great. The quality seems very good too. Very durable. And it has a good weight to it, so it doesn't slide around on my desk.",

                "reviewText": "This keyboard is my dream come true. I worry that it's too good to be true and that the line will be discontinued at some point; which would mean that I'd have to go back to having multiple keyboards around my desk...I work on several platforms continuously: Mac for personal stuff (left), Linux for development (middle), and Windows for work (right). The Logitech MX Keys fits my workflow perfectly; allowing me to use one keyboard across all three platforms so I can bounce back and forth at will. This keyboard has really shattered all of the hurdles I have traditionally had to negotiate in my multi-platform environment - it's a true joy to use.Pros:- setup is a breeze- backlighting is configurable and very pleasant to use- the key action is comfortable in coming from my Mac, which, until I started using the MX Keys, was easily my favorite - now I've got the same tactile feeling for all platforms (+1)- bluetooth connectivity works well on all three- battery life is decent. I recharge more with the MX Keys, but that small hassle is well worth the investment IMHOCons:- the platform differences on key layout remain. MX Keys is geared toward the Mac (i.e., it has Control, Option, and Command buttons on the bottom left corner rather than Ctrl, Windows, Alt on a PC). I'm already system ambidextrous so this isn't a big deal for me, but it might be for others.- my biggest gripe, and it's one that completely puzzles me, is the fact that the MX Keys supports 3 different computers simultaneously, but its sibling device - the MX Ergo trackball - only supports 2. You'll notice in my picture that I've got an Apple Trackpad on my desk - I used it for the Linux system because I tend to work on the command line more in that environment, but I really, truly wish that Logitech would implement a third channel on the MX Ergo so that these two devices would flow perfectly across all my systems. (NOTE: this is by no means a detractor for the MX Keys, I'm sure the Ergo will catch up soon...)",

                "reviewText": "update: gave this keyboard 5 stars again because I found a solution. To pair the Bolt and Unifying receivers with your MX keyboard and MX mouse requires at minimum Mac OS Mojave to install the Bolt App 1.0.7948 and LogiMgr 8.54.147 of which these older apps are no longer available from Logitech and you need to find them from 3rd party downloaders. However, short version, once paired Bolt and Unifying Receiver you can delete the Logitech apps and move the receivers (Bolt and Unifying) to another machine and they remained paired. The paired info is stored in non-volatile memory so what that means is that you can pair your Bolt and Unifying receiver on a newer Mac or your friends Mac and then just insert them into your older Mac that is running Sierra. Although it is a bit late for me as I had to patch install Mojave on my Mac mini (4 times) and searched for older versions of the Bolt App and Logi options app (for unifying pairing) with the Bolt App crashing my Mac repeatedly, the good news is that I did un-install the Bolt App afterwards but leaving the Logi Options app installed to control the speed of my MX Anywhere 3 mouse. update: All kinds of problems - reduced my overall rating to 2. So I've been pairing this keyboard with my MacBook 12\" and was hoping to pair it with my Mac mini to give me a working cluster of computers as I switch between them all with my HDMI switch. This keyboard does not pair with my Mac mini mid 2010 and even though I managed to upgrade my Mac OS to Sierra. This keyboard doesn't work with the unifying USB neither and even though I probably could buy the Bolt USB I won't be able to pair it with Bolt because the Bolt software needs at least Catalina to pair and my Mac mini only max updates to Sierra OS. So sad really.... You would think all bluetooth works with ALL Bluetooth.Original Review:I have been a logitech keyboard users for more than a decade now. For a long time Logitech thought that the K380 was good enough replacement but I hated the chicklet keys. This new MX keys mini is a very good replacement for the K811 keyboard in both the size of the keyboard and the size of the keys. With the ability to connect up to three devices I currently have it connected to my MacBook 12\", my iPad pro and my iPhone 8 plus; well not concurrently but selectable and switchable amongst 3 devices. I have the black version forthcoming. Currently this keyboard which is the mac version will be used for my music composition MacBook. The black one which is arriving in November will be used with my everyday Macbook 12\" computer and my VR PC. The keys on this MX mini are wonderful as they feel like every logitech keys on every logitech keyboard through every generation. A soft clickable keyboard that doesn't make a lot of noise and has just the right amount of key depth to each click of the keys. I'm a touch typist and I love the feel of this keyboard as the words spills out of my brain and on to the review box without having to look at what I am typing. I will be buying several for back ups as I won't be left high and dry like the K811 and K810 keyboards that were discontinued and replaced by the k380. There is only one problem with this keyboard though and if you look at the back of the keyboard you will notice that it is actually quite thick and that is the battery and component bar that acts as a keyboard riser. So if you have a keyboard drawer that just holds your keyboard, the actual thickness is just a little over 1/2 an inch. Don't let the photographs fool you on a thin keyboard like the K811 but nevertheless it is still quite thin but has a large battery rechargeable bar. My K811 is breaking down, not only the battery doesn't last as long but some keys don't quite respond until you press it two or three times of which it is terrible because you get all these spelling errors when you are a touch typist. Once my mx mini black keyboard arrives, I will be ordering at least two more to keep for the next decade. Trust me that once you become addicted to a logitech keyboard you will never go back to the standard Apple smart keyboard. The ability to connect up to 3 bluetooth devices gives you the luxury of typing on your phone, you iPad and your mac by just a single press of a key. Yay for Logitech!!",

                "reviewText": "I'm always looking for the perfect keyboard. I have over 15 different keyboards that I've tried with my iMacs (Intel), iPADs, and Windows PCs.I'm very happy with the Logitech MX Keys Mini and don't plan to swap this one out or revert to one of my older keyboards.Strengths: > Sturdy and Compact - freeing up desk space > Easy Set Up via Bluetooth with up to 3 devices (incl. Macs, PCs, IOS, etc.). > Good Key Travel and spacing leading to greater typing accuracy (even compared to the three Apple Keyboards I use) > Backlighting that turns on if I hover my fingers/hand over the keyboard > Better (slightly higher) incline than the keyboard tilt/angle than modern Apple Keyboards > Good battery life (weeks of heavy use per charge via USB-c cable).Things I wish it had: > Adjustable Tilt levels > Wish I could use the Logitech Options app to change the default backlighting auto-off from 5secs to 15-20secs, knowing that the battery life may be cut in half.My only real issue: I can only speak to Intel-based iMacs (running Monterey or High Sierra) , but upon a reboot or startup, the MAC OS still needs me to grab a wired keyboard or an Apple KB to login into my account. As soon as this is done, the Logitech Keyboard can be used.Overall, I've been putting off buying this Mini MX Keyboard. It is a little expensive. At $80-$90, it would be a no-brainer. However, it has all the key things I want and the added typing accuracy causes less frustration and saves time overall. Well worth it! I don't think I'll be looking for another new keyboard to try for the next year or two, likely a newer revision of this same keyboard by Logitech!",

I don\u2019t like thick keys so I was looking for something low profile similar to MacBook keyboards. It pretty much came down to apple Magic Keyboard and this MX keys mini.What sold me on this was the backlit keyboard, something Magic Keyboard doesn\u2019t have. I need the backlight as I usually use my laptop at night in dim lighting. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t stay lit all the time. The backlight turns on when your hands hover over the keys. The response time is pretty quick. And then it turns off after a few seconds of no use.The keys are really nice. It feels pretty similar and sounds about the same as a macbook keyboard, maybe slightly louder. I don\u2019t notice an advantage or disadvantage to the concave key caps. The silver is ever so slightly darker than my silver MacBook but you wouldn\u2019t notice unless you put them right next to each other and look closely.The battery life is good so far using it for about one month.",
