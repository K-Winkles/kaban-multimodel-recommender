                "reviewText": "A fairly inexpensive 60% keyboard with clicky mechanical switches. It's satisfying to type on and has an impressive set of modern features for the price. The keyboard is powered via USB-C, has a nice, single-color LED backlight with multiple settings, comes with some extra key caps, and is weighted nicely. I am not a keyboard enthusiast, and would definitely not recommend this for people wanting a platform to build/modify. For most casuals, this is a fine keyboard.Negatives are as follows: The LED is dim even at it's brightest. If you do not use Windows, some of the function keys may not work. Finally, the key travel seems long, but this would only affect those who are new to using mechanical keyboards.",

Throw some foam in the bottom of it and tape the back of the PCB with painters tape and you have a keyboard that feels and sounds better than any razer keyboard out there. I broke a NuPhy air 75 and a Razer black widow v3 just this year by dropping it off my recliner chair. So I bought this one. At least when this one breaks. I\u2019m only out 30 dollars instead of 150. But to be honest. This keyboard with the lights mods I did to it is the best keyboard Iv ever used. Big fan. I recommend it. All the other keyboards are from China. So why not get the cheaper one that admits it up front.",

                "reviewText": "I wish I could give this a stellar review, but I can't. In fact, I won't recommend any Magegee product any more. I got this because I bought a full size keyboard from this company, and after a few months, the \"E\" key kept double-keying, making it almost useless to someone who writes on their computer. I will say this, the company were very gracious and refunded me the cost even though it was past the refund limit. I do think they are run by nice people.The problem is, I bought this to replace that one, and it just stopped working all the time. Looking around for an answer, I found that a lot of people had good results by replacing the USB cable. I tried that and it seemed to help. The problem is that the actual problem is not the cable, it's the USB interface. It breaks communication with your PC ALL THE TIME. If you use a good cable, it will re-establish the connection so quick, you won't notice it, but that still leaves a problem for me. I use a digital KVM, (Keyboard, Video, Mouse) to use one keyboard and mouse between two different systems. I've never had a problem using it with ANY keyboard I plugged in. With the Magegee, when it drops connection, even for a millisecond, when it reasserts the connection, the keyboard AND mouse drop back to the host computer, even if you were using the client computer at the time. As someone who types a lot, it is a miserable failure when, without your noticing it, your cursor goes to the wrong computer while you are typing, and your text disappears, because the machine you are typing on doesn't even have an input box open. If you were using this while gaming, you'd tear your hair out.I get that this is a problem most users won't have, but it is a problem some people will have. If you are doing IT and managing servers, it's useless. If you are just using the one system, it should be fine, but I wouldn't recommend you buy a dog with a twisted stomach, or a keyboard with a known flaw in it. You don't know how it will affect you, and whether it will only degrade worse over time.Two keyboards, two major flaws, I'm not a customer any more. Sorry, Magegee.",
