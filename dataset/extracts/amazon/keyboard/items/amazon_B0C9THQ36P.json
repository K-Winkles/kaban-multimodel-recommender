                "reviewText": "I got this keyboard after my Lenovo trackpoint keyboard finally broke. I have been an avid trackpoint user for many, many years and thought this would be a good time to try out switching to a mechanical keyboard. I wanted to go for a retro theme and when I saw this one I knew it would be a good candidate.The keyboard itself is very nice. It has a hefty feel to it and doesnt slide around the desk. It doesnt feel flimsy or plastic-y. I am a good touch typist and in my work so far I have been pleased with the response rate. The keys feel like the old school keyboards I used in the past. The switches are good and provide a good tactile feedback. Being my first mechanical keyboard I dont know how to compare to others yet. The keycaps are not LED capable so the letters dont glow. That would be one suggestion I would have for XVX--you should include keys that let the light through. The alternate color keycaps included are nice and make the keys easier to see. I wish they had included some alternate color keys for the special keys on the right.The LED screen is a great way to control the keyboard without necessarily installing device drivers. You can connect to your machine and set the colors and patterns very easily. The battery life is pretty decent but it will drain faster than I thought it would so I will probably end up getting a retro cable to keep it plugged in most of the time.I did run into one issue where my \"a\" key kept sticking every once in a while. It was enough of a concern that I contacted XVX and asked for help. They were able to quickly resolve by sending me extra parts to replace the switch. The customer service was excellent!Overall I am very pleased with the keyboard and feel it will work well for my daily needs. I like that I can continue to customize it with new looks. I hope to get some LED-compatible keycaps. One thing I would recommend getting this keyboard is a wristpad. It was just high enough that I found myself hitting keys inadvertently without one. The lenovo keyboard is very low profile so it may be just readjusting on my part but a writstpad has helped greatly. Great keyboard overall!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Some points*MOST mechanical keyboards are good for gaming, so if you're asking that question: yes, it games.*The Outemu White \"Silent\" switches are quite audible, which was fine by me as the actual sound is very satisfyingly thunky to me. Spacebar sounds even thunkier than the rest of the keys which used to bother me but has since grown on me.*I have spilled juice on it already and have used the hot-swappable capabilities of the switches to clean up, which was nice until I ruined two of them by putting the switches in the wrong way, so be mindful of this. I am, at the time of writing, able to find a 20-pack of these switches here on Amazon for around $15, or around $6 for 10 via goblintechkeys.com I will also note that the switches are now stained red with juice, which bothers me, and is no one else's problem.*This thing has so many color patterns for RGB (17 total) but not a single one of my keys has any transparency for backlight capabilities. easily fixed with new keycaps that I will probably not end up investing in. The patterns themselves are pretty cool.*NO extra cover provided for the top of the board in case you want to transport it without the original box, which I tend to do because now every other keyboard feels like I'm typing on a school computer from 2009. That being said, having used an even longer keyboard with a num-pad before the XVX, I was excited to see that even with the box being a good amount larger than the board itself due to extra parts and cushioning it STILL fits relatively comfortably in my standard Adidas backpack.*The software this comes with to modify RGB patterns, macros, and the GIF that displays on the little screen, was originally written in Chinese, I had to find the language setting to change it. Easy enough. However, this software is not beginner-friendly at all, to the point that I don't even use it, which does not impede the functionality of the keyboard itself. It would be nice to change the loop on the screen but quite frankly I like the anime girl typing in the corner so I don't mind it.*This is the coolest keyboard I've ever owned, really lives up to that retro aesthetic to the point that my older friends and family are frequently pleasantly surprised that I'm using it. I'm super satisfied with the functionality and build quality of this board. Would recommend other XVX products if the quality extends across all of their inventory.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:1.) Switches: I feel faster at typing than my silent reds. They sound fine too, thock. They're also hot swappable!2.) Display is higher quality than I thought it would be3.) Multiple bluetooth functionality so you can swap between devices which can be nice4.) cool gifsCons:1.) (jan 2024) For the software, the xvx website was down (SSL cert errors) so I had to navigate to their latest archived page on archive org, select my software version, and then grab the link from their error page and paste it into my URL to download the software directly. (wtf)2.) The software crashes sometimes, but its not really an issue?3.) The switches aren't the best for gaming, I felt a loss in precision? ex. in rocket league with WASD, I couldn't make as precise adjustments, the car would turn too much compared to my silent red switches.4.) Lights are a little dim4 1/2.) Mine came bent (flopped as i typed) so I just leaned on it with the edge of my table and that fixed that.Overall, the initial setup was way more than I wanted to deal with. Then, some personal things I disliked were that the feet were a little low for me, I feel like the knob is slightly off color, and it's backlit but the keys aren't transparent, so its kind of odd. But now that I'm set up properly, it's pretty worth the price assuming it lasts.",
