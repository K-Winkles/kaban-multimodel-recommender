                "reviewText": "the keyboard is amazing to look at and easy to clean.TL;DR: seems like a sturdy keyboard, easy to clean, preloaded color schemes should the software fail (in theory), has some neat features so long as the software is working, and German Engineering meme right on the box.the keys have a somewhat loud click to them with each press, so depending on the user that's either a pro or a con, to me it's neutral, kinda fun when typing in discord to hear the clickity-clack but also makes me feel a little conscious when I see my mic lighting up because it's picking up those clicks. the default profile colors aren't bad either, it's the major reason I picked this keyboard out of all the ones on sale during Prime Day.So far, the software is working as intended too which is awesome, the patterns one can make are enough for most and it's fun that the software can be programmed to use different color layouts for different games, wanna use 1980s pinks and blues while flying an F-14 Tomcat in War Thunder? Done. and once you close the game, it'll switch back to your desktop color before switching again while Destiny 2 boots up.I've gone through several keyboards not because the hardware failed me, but because their software failed and left me locked in with rainbow waves or other less-than-ideal patterns that wore thin fast. with this one having 4 preloaded patterns I'm hoping that won't be an issue should the software fail.also, I like that the note leans into the manufacturer's german heritage by thanking the buyer in german, and even on the box they proudly boast about the German Engineering.finally, the AIMO rainbow-breathing-button-pressing pattern is quite fun to watch and use.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great keyboard & beautiful RGB",
                "reviewText": "First things first - this keyboard has hands-down the most beautiful RGB I've seen anywhere. The specially made keycaps paired with the AIMO software really do make this keyboard look beautiful. I still find myself staring at it from time to time, just admiring the engineering that went into making this lighting a reality. The steel backplate gives the Vulcan a sturdy feel and a good bit of weight. The separation and elevation of the keycaps combined with the steel backplate means cleaning the Vulcan is very easy. A can of compressed air mostly does the job. The keycaps do leave a bit of oil residue, but it's not a big deal or easy to see over the RGB. I managed to get the keys looking like new with a cloth and a bit of rubbing alcohol.Performance-wise, I have no complaints. Actuation force to get the keys pushed in is quite low, but there is a tactile bump to let you know the key has been depressed. It's an easy sink into a thunk. I will say that I had to get used to the separated & elevated design of the keycaps as it means if you're not careful your fingers can get a little caught up in gaps. This issue will diminish as you get used to the keyboard and your motor memory kicks in, but it is jarring nonetheless.One other small complaint - the W key has a little finder divot etched into it (the same divot the F key has etched into it on most keyboards). Presumably this was done to make finding the W key easier for gamers, but in my opinion it was unnecessary and sort of buries itself uncomfortably into the fingertip. Like the space between the keycaps, this is something I eventually got used to and I don't even notice it anymore, but for the future I would appreciate if Roccat got rid of this divot. It's simply not necessary.Overall, small complaints aside, this is a great keyboard. It is the most beautiful gaming keyboard out there in my opinion and well-engineered in terms of build quality and performance.",

                "reviewText": "This is an amazing keyboard. I built my PC last year and used Corsair K55 Membrane keyboard until I decide to switch to Mechanical. I had my eye on the K95 Platinum until I found this keyboard one a Top 10 Keyboards list from a website. It instantly caught my attention, I loved the look. It's simple and sleek, looks futuristic IMO, and best of all it feels good to use. I was worried about the sound with mechanical keyboards and it isn't as loud as I was expecting which is good for me. It's tactile and responsive, feels very nice typing something up or just gaming in general.I play a lot Rainbow Six Siege so I went there to test it out. I had to adjust a bit because the keys are quite more elevated and spaced out from my previous keyboard which makes it look sleek and also easier to clean.The Roccat Software is also good, I like it better than iCue.Overall, I really love this keyboard and have zero regrets. If you want a great mechanical keyboard which looks and feels amazing then I suggest you get this.Update: 3/21/22After almost 2 years, it's still going strong. No other keyboards on the market so far have convinced me change it up and I still love how it looks and feels.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this board. The Roccat swarm software makes this thing really configurable for any RGB setup. The floating keycap design paired with the low profile keycaps make it an RGB dream. The only thing I don't like is the keycaps have a very high pitched ping when typing at speed. I don't notice it much while gaming but when typing for long sessions the spacebar especially has a constant loud \"ping\" to it. Other than that it's a solid keyboard: easy to clean, sleek, and great build quality. I assume using different keycaps might fix the sound issue but then that defeats the purpose of the low profile for the amazing RGB. Recommended to a friend and he bought one, he loves it and has no complaints.",
