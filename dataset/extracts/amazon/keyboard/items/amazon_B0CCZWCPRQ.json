I had been pretty happy with it except that it was kinda loud as far as the clackety clack of the keys as you were typing. made it very hard to do any typing and not have EVERYONE know that you were typing something. Anyway, because I was pretty happy with it I got another one...this one. and I am thrilled with it. The keys are so quiet. Its awesome. I also have a rainbow mouse that changes color along with my earphones (Razor...yessss) the keyboard doesn't shift color but that is quite ok. Its lightweight and I can adjust it to fit my typing style. I also game and my wrists don't hurt with this keyboard.The wrapping was a little weird, but there was no damage to the box so I didn't worry about it. It was plug and play.it is USB.Even though I'm not a big rainbow fan the colors are vibrant and its pretty cool so everything matches. Yay.",

                "reviewText": "I recently upgraded to this keyboard, and it has completely transformed my typing experience. This keyboard is nothing short of a typist's dream come true.The first thing that struck me is the build quality. It's solid, durable, and feels like it can withstand years of heavy use. The keys have a satisfying tactile feedback, making typing a pleasure. It's perfect for anyone who spends a lot of time at their computer.The key switches are exceptionally responsive, resulting in faster and more accurate typing. Whether you're typing up documents, coding, or just chatting with friends, this keyboard is a joy to use.The backlighting is a fantastic feature. It not only adds a touch of style but also makes typing in dimly lit environments a breeze. You can adjust the brightness and choose from various colors to suit your preferences.The keyboard is also versatile, with programmable keys and shortcut options for improved productivity. It's compatible with both Mac and Windows systems, making it a versatile choice.One minor drawback is that it can be a bit on the pricier side, but the quality and performance more than justify the investment.In conclusion, if you're in search of a high-quality keyboard that elevates your typing experience, this one is worth every penny. It's well-built, highly responsive, and a pleasure to type on. I can't recommend it enough!",

                "reviewText": "Having used and tested, a multitude of keyboards over more than 40 years in Computer Science, I am a bit of an expert on them. I have disliked the cheap ones we get these days with machines, but not found many I like these days for under $50 USD...thus just made do. I spend as much as 12 hours a day using a keyboard. My last cheap one I had worn off 10 of the keys and needed a new one badly. I decided to research a new one again with focus on easy to see and use for under $30 USD.We each may have a preferred layout and tactile feel, but this keyboard is well laid out, tactile is moderate and easy to work with. Keys are slightly concave on the sides making easier to feel finger position and solid strikes. I noticed as soon I lifted it out of the box is had a very solid feel and weight to it, much better than the cheap made ones in same price range, that are so light they slide around.Back lighting is a vast improvement for my old eyes and/or low light, with three, usable, levels of brightness (or On/Off) settings (FN+PgUp & FN+PgDn). The multi-color scheme is locked but very easy to work with.This is the second keyboard by RII I have used. The first one was a small, rechargable, wireless one I used with my TV and Streaming Devices, in the past and was well pleased with it's - \"Bang for the Buck.\" This keyboard after a few days use is also, \"In My Honest Opinion\", A Good Investment.",

                "reviewText": "The main reason I bought this was because my keyboard keys are going and I do a lot of typing at work. But for some reason some keys just miss, and it's not that the keys arent working but they just need a little bit more pressure, which is hard because I type really fast. But when I tried it for gaming, it was sweet to pressure press the keys. So this is not a fast typing key board but it great for those shooter games, and the lighting mode are awesome too.",

                "reviewText": "Replacing keyboards is pretty common with a gamer. My last one had some sticky keys, actually from day one. I replaced with this backlit, colorful keyboard recently. What a difference! The keys are quiet and the accuracy is what I wish all keyboards performed like. The keys respond quickly and evenly. There has not been a problem with some keys sticking like my last one. To me, even the slightest sticky key is going to affect my gaming. I am hoping this keyboard lasts a long time - I\u2019d ove to find a keyboard from a company where the product works perfectly all of the time. I\u2019d love to know what keyboard replacement to order each time, and I replace my keyboard about every other month!Looking for a reliable gaming keyboard? This looks so nice and fun BUT MAINLY it works super well!",
