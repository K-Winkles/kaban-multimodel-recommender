                "reviewText": "This is probably the best feeling/tactile keyboard I've ever used. Writing a lot, I use the keyboard more than mouse, touchscreen or anything else, so the feel of the keyboard is important to me. Most PC keyboards are eh quality; Macs are good but not perfect. This Logitech keyboard has the best, most satisfying and solid feel of any keyboard I've ever owned. Heavy keys, a rubberized surface that grips well, nicely shaped keys, solid and well-weighted body, all come together to make this one of the best and most solid feeling keyboards ever. The lighting is slightly annoying but I'll get used to it. The keys light up when they sense your hands approaching, and stay lighted while typing; after a moment the lights dim until approached again. Not conducive to sitting and thinking at the keyboard, but I guess as wireless/rechargeable, it has to save battery life. Bluetooth to Mac was tricky. Didn't work on first several tries. Kept asking to type a code into the device to connect. Initially failed so I used the USB dongle. A few days later tried again, and this time it connected. So it does work well with Mac on Bluetooth but takes a few tries. Aside from that, having purchased one of the $30-40 range keyboards then this one, I love this one so much, it's worth the price point. Also Logitech stuff lasts forever, I have a wireless mouse that's about 100 years old and still perfect, so you can't go wrong with the brand.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using the ProtoArc EK01 backlit keyboard for a while and had become rather annoyed at the layout and poor wake connectivity (I'd have to hit a key a number of times to get an input to start). I needed something to switch between my work and personal laptops easily, wasn't wonky with placement of Delete, Backspace and Print Screen (functions I use quite often, with buttons that happen to be very close on the EK01). The Logitech MX Keys S is perfect. I use the Bolt dongle for my personal keyboard (to minimize input delay while gaming or whatever), and Bluetooth on my work laptop.... I even connected the 3rd switch to my Steam Deck, when I need to get into Desktop mode.While I miss the more ergonomic layout, the size of the MX Keys S is perfect for my desk's keyboard tray and it's big enough that my hands are cramped together. The more traditional key layout is definitely a better experience, as I'm not accidentally hitting NumLock instead of Delete or Backspace.Typing is a quiet and satisfying action (I'm not a big fan of the clickety mechanical keyboards that some prefer and if you're looking for that, this is not the keyboard for you). While I do use it for gaming, I'm not a pro-gamer or anything and this is sufficient for me. I'm not sure I'd recommend this for someone who is an avid or very picky gamer-type. I highly recommend it for those looking for a good productivity keyboard who may game for a bit now and again.Connectivity is fantastic. Waking up the keyboard and laptop is practically instant and I have not had any issues, having to wait, tapping a key numerous times to get it to finally do something. As stated, I'm using all three connection options and the MX Keys S switches seamlessly between the devices to which it's connected.Software management is great. The new Logi Options+ software allows you to manage backlighting settings and map select keys. This was one of the biggest problems I had early on with the ProtoArc EK01 (before the connectivity degraded), in that you weren't able to customize anything on it. Logitech has provided users with a great tool to manage some basic functionality, and that's just good customer-focused engineering, right there.Battery life is solid with most Logitech products and the software tool will help you manage it better. Frankly, I'm not a tech tester and didn't put it through any tests like that. I use my keyboard in one spot only, and am probably burning the battery out as I never unplug it.TL;DR, great productivity and light recreational keyboard, with great software management and decent physical dimensions and layout. I can't speak to using it on the go, but for my office set up, switching between my work laptop and personal PC, I have been very pleased.Pros:Connectivity optionsQuiet keysTraditional key layoutSoftware to manage the deviceCons:On the pricey side, >$100Ergonomics are not optimalMy 5-star review is in the context of how I use this keyboard. I love it. It may not be for everyone, but is nearly perfect (for me).",

                "reviewText": "I upgraded my keyboard to the Logitech MX Keys 3 months ago and I haven't looked back. Here's why this wireless keyboard deserves the high praise:Pros:Low Profile Design: The low-profile keys provide a sleek and comfortable typing experience. The keys feel responsive without being too clicky.Wireless: The wireless connectivity is reliable and stable, and the battery life is excellent (this keyboard charges from a usb-c to regular usb charger for those wondering). This keyboard can connect to 3 devices at once using the device selector keys which is helpful when working from multiple work spaces.Light-weight and high quality: The keyboard is extremely light and thin while also feeling very sturdy, the quality is simply the best on the market.Cons:I honestly struggled to find any significant drawbacks. However, if I had to nitpick:Price Point: While the quality justifies the cost, it might be a bit steep for budget-conscious buyers.Backlighting: I personally don't mind the lack of backlighting control on this keyboard some people have complained that the auto dimming feature not being able to be turned off is distracting.",

                "reviewText": "The Logitech MX Keys Mini is well-built, has a nice weight to it and looks and feels premium. Despite the all-plastic construction, the keyboard feels solid, doesn't flex and made with good quality materials. The keys and top bezel as made with a nice matte plastic with an off-white finish. The keys feel great and the finish hides fingerprints. The faux aluminum finish looked okay, not nowhere close to the quality of the Apple Magic Keyboard.Most of the keys have a concave indent, which I thought I wouldn't like but I didn't mind it at all and it didn't impact the typing experience. The typing experience is very good and the keys are nicely tactile and have good amount of travel. The keys have some play when gently pressing on the corners, but the overall feel is good for a membrane keyboard. I was able to touch type at my fastest speed. It is also fairly quiet in use and is the reason I use membrane keyboards for productivity work instead of mechanical. Even mechanical keyboards using red or brown switches are too loud to use.This replaces my Microsoft Designer Compact, which I did enjoy using because of its size but also because of its multi-device support. You can pair up to 3 different devices and switch between them with the 3 keys on function row. Having dedicated keys to switch between devices was far more handy than the single key on the Microsoft Designer Compact. The typing experience on the MX Keys Mini is also better than the Designer Compact, with more travel and more tactile feel. The MX Keys Mini also has backlighting and rechargeable battery, both features missing I really like that the keyboard has labels on keys for both PC and Mac, important for me since I have this keyboard paired with a PC and Mac.The Logitech Options software allows you to customize the MX Keys Mini. I also tried Flow to seamlessly move between different computers on same network. You do have to install and configure Flow on the computers you want to use it on and it works best if you also pair it with a compatible Logitech mouse. I paired it with a MX Anywhere 3 and installed Flow on my Surface Pro (Windows 10) and Mac Mini. I was able to move between both computers and it switched inputs on both keyboard and mice, but there was sometimes a bit of a lag when switching. It's a interesting feature but it's just not as polished or refined as I would like.",

It feels very well built, it\u2019s got some weight to it, the keys are really nice, you can easily switch devices, and it looks good. It\u2019s overall a very premium feeling & looking keyboard. For context, I usually use mechanical keyboards and I don't hate typing on it. Typing on this is probably as close as you\u2019ll get to a mechanical feel on a membrane board. I\u2019m not joking it\u2019s actually that good. It doesn\u2019t feel \u201cmushy\u201d like some membranes do.The problem is the backlighting, as you can see in the video I attached the backlight automatically times out after like 3-5 seconds of removing your hand. There is no way to change this, as Logitech considers it a \u201cfeature\u201d but it is probably the dumbest feature I\u2019ve ever encountered. I understand needing to save battery, but they could have easily made the backlighting timeout 30 seconds instead of 5. It is absolutely infuriating and distracting to have the light flashing on & off constantly while using it in the dark. As you can see there is a proximity sensor, but the proximity sensor only registers you as using the keyboard when you\u2019re actually touching a key. If you want to change the duration of the backlight timeout it can\u2019t be done on this model, you have to get the \u201cS\u201d model that costs 150$. This is ridiculous that this keyboard can be this good but have this one major flaw. They already have the Logi+ app, I can\u2019t understand why Logitech doesn\u2019t just fix this via a firmware update. I unfortunately only found out about this after I bought it, so I\u2019m writing this review here on Amazon to warn others. If you don\u2019t care about backlights, you\u2019ll love this, but otherwise be prepared to be annoyed.",
