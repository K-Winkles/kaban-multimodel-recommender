                "reviewText": "In the realm of software development and coding, a reliable keyboard is as crucial as a sharp mind. The Keychron K2 Version 2 Wireless Gaming Mechanical Keyboard is not just a tool; it's a game-changer. As a graduate student and developer, I've experienced firsthand how this keyboard transforms the mundane task of typing into something akin to a symphony.The tactile feedback of the Gateron G Pro Brown Switches is like music to my fingers. Each keystroke is satisfyingly smooth yet responsive, making coding sessions less of a chore and more of an enjoyable experience. It's the kind of tactile feedback that makes you want to write just one more line of code, or perhaps an entire additional function.Wireless functionality and the option to switch to wired mode are like having the best of both worlds. The Bluetooth connectivity ensures a clutter-free desk, essential for maintaining focus and organization, especially in a busy student environment. And when it comes to uninterrupted gaming sessions or heavy-duty coding, the USB wired option offers reliability without lag.Now, let's talk about the compact 84-key layout. It's the perfect balance between functionality and space-saving design. This keyboard provides all the necessary keys without the bulk of a full-size board, making it an ideal fit for smaller workspaces (hello, dorm room desks!).The RGB LED backlight is not just about aesthetics; it's about functionality. The customizable lighting options are not only cool to look at but also practical for those late-night coding sessions. It's like having a personal light show that also helps you see your keys in the dark.The build quality, with its aluminum frame, speaks of durability and a premium feel. It's robust enough to handle the rigors of daily use, whether that's in a professional setting or a high-intensity gaming scenario. This keyboard feels like it's built to last, much like a well-structured piece of code.N-Key rollover is another feature that cannot go unmentioned. The accuracy it provides during high-speed typing or gaming is impeccable, ensuring that every keystroke is registered without fail. It's the kind of dependability that every programmer and gamer longs for.In conclusion, the Keychron K2 Version 2 is more than just a keyboard; it's a crucial component for anyone serious about their typing experience. Whether it's for coding, gaming, or general use, this keyboard offers a blend of comfort, functionality, and style. It's an investment that pays off in every click.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using the Cooler Master blue-switch Quick Fire Rapid mechanical keyboard for a while. I initially purchased it for my windows dedicated gaming PC, which I sold about three years ago. Overall, I've been happy with it, but it is the Windows version and over the last couple of years I've been using it on my 2020 MacBook Pro.Lately, I've been wanting the dedicated keys specific to MAC on a mechanical keyboard (e.g. brightness, volume, command key, option, etc.). Politically, I'm not an Apple fan and wish they would stick to what they do best. However, they have solid hardware, software, customer support, which I prefer for pursuing my second masters degree over the Windows platform. I've been using Apple for years... HomePods, iPhones, MacBooks, iPads and so forth.I opted to try the brown keys from my blues... great choice for quick touch typists (you aren't heavy-handed mashing keys...even so, this will fit the bill).With the blue switches, I have to be quite a bit more precise with my keypresses due to the mechanical feedback/actuation. I often miss key presses because I do not pressing the keys down far enough due to the resistance require for that extra click feedback... so I opted for the brown switches because I like the feedback of the blues, but wanted something that required less effort like the reds.. I'd take a blue switch over red anyway... just not my thing as I like the feedback with slight auditory feedback... blue are just way too loud and disruptive when others are in the surrounding area.I ended up getting the K2 with brown switches. Perfect match for typing papers... not too loud, but I get that satisfying clacking sound without having to get past that \"hard click.\" Blues also make it a challenge to double press keys (two of the same letters back to back e.g. \"tt\" in the word \"letters). This makes my typing much more effortless while still getting that ever so slight and satisfying feedback (extremely subtle). I'm in love. Do I like the blue switches, oh ya, do I like the browns, I'm in heaven and probably should have opted for this switch-set long ago.I see myself using this keyboard for long nights typing 15-25 page papers as well as gaming as I did with my blue switches. I like the loud feedback/click of the blue, but I get that somewhat with browns and I don't have to work as hard or be as accurate with my typing since it doesn't require as much pressure with my key presses. My typing is much more on point when writing papers, extended emails, etc.Form factor wise, the K2 it is very compact. Awesome due to my restricted desktop space and I don't need the # keypad. When I read reviews, many mentioned the large and elevated front lip area... ughh, I understand what they are saying... ergonomically, no issues on my end with the elevated feet on the top side extended. It is nearly perfect... even without the top side being elevated. I'm pretty sure this company likely took this into consideration when designing the product, but it may not be for everyone (the thicker front frame area).Is the hype true? I'd say so. Look at all the positive feedback on Amazon. The company has been pretty successful. The keyboard was nearly $100 for me and I'm glad I decided to just spend the money to give it a try. The design is simplistic and looks great (professional environments and for gamers... wonderful compromise if that's what you call it). The RGB backlighting is fun and interesting, but not a necessity. I enjoy it overall.Would I recommend this keyboard to my peers and family? Without hesitation. I'd recommend it to my gamer friends as well as working professionals... and those who just want a keyboard that is comfortable. For those that just want something to plug and play... not for the money... e.g. my mother who will sit on Youtube and Facebook finger jamming away at keys.Summarily... get this keyboard if you want a solid typing and gaming experience from a quality product... for the average person finger-pricking at the keys... just go to Walmart and get a $5-10 keyboard. If your here looking at reviews... it is for a reason... you want a descent keyboard and are willing to spend the money... I'd say do it without hesitation. I purchased mine thinking I'd try it and simply send it back if it gave me any reasonable doubt... it is staying and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase it again if need be...-------14OCT20-------Just wanted to emphasize after owning this keyboard for a brief period now that it is one of the best typing experiences I have ever had since my 20+ years of having to type on keyboards... I have 3 degrees, so I've done a lot of typing in regards to my life experience. I without a doubt would recommend this to family, friends for personal, school, and professional use without hesitation. The keyboard is a steal at around $80-100. The build quality and color scheme are outstanding as well and will fit most any environment... looks professional as well as fun with the addition of RGB that can be set to just white. This keyboard is great for gamers as well... just a no nonsense, compact, aesthetically pleasing keyboard that performs flawlessly. I know I mentioned a lot of this previously, but I can't emphasize enough how wonderful this keyboard has been since I constantly have to use it day in and day out.",

                "reviewText": "I'm typing this review on my K2v2 and I'm extremely impressed. I previously tried the Keychron K2v2 hot swappable model but due to a product defect, Amazon allowed me return it for a full refund. I decided to try the non hot swappable model which is this one. The legends are sharp and clear on the grey colour keycaps and it has a striking appearance especially with the RGB lighting, however as these keycaps aren't double shot I suspect they won't last as long. The battery life is fantastic and there are no issues with bluetooth pairing. Everything works as it should. The gateron red switches are satisfying and very smooth to type on providing a nice thock sound. I think they must be pre-lubed as they feel much better than Cherry MX keyboards I've used in the past. Overall I can highly recommend this keyboard for it's rich feature set and aesthetics. I won't be changing my switches so I would recommend going with this model over the hot swappable one due to the brighter backlighting and better colour keycaps, but some may prefer to have the removal switches.",

                "reviewText": "First time using a mechanical keyboard, and I have tried brown key switches before, but these gateron pro browns are phenomenal. The RGB is very good, not sure if I personally would custumise it, but for those who do, there might be either 3rd party software to do so, otherwise good luck with that. The muted colour scheme is great, the two greys are not as different in brightness compared to the photos, but the difference is noticable, but either way there are swappable. Also might take some time to get used to the arrow keys taking up the right shift key.Overall, great keyboard, the brown switches are nice and the RGB is very good, and might take some time to get used to the arrow keys positioning, if you're not familiar with the layout.",
