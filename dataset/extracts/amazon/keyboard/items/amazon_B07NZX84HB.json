                "reviewText": "I purchased this to replace a worn-out Cooler Master CM Storm gaming keyboard. I am very pleased with it so far after about two months of regular use.The build quality is very good and feels sturdy. I didn't think I would care about the programmable multicolor LED lighting, but now I don't know how I ever lived without it!Most importantly, the keys are rock-solid and have a very satisfying CLICK with every keystroke. I am a 100wpm+ typist and I tend to hit keys hard and fast - I find this to be perhaps the most-responsive keyboard I've ever used in that regard, and I never feel like I had a dead input or missed keystroke. In other words, the responsiveness and \"clicky-ness\" feels exactly like I would expect.It reminds me, to an extent, of the IBM / Apple / Commodore mechanical keyboards I used when I was a kid (1980s), in a good way.Note: this is a USB-wired keyboard, which I prefer because of low latency and the lack of need for batteries. The cable is a nice and flexible mesh-covered type, with a perfect length.Overall, I'm satisfied and I will look to other Razer products for future PC needs.",

                "reviewText": "I love this keyboard. The software is intuitive. It feels comfortable without a wrist rest which is nice. I love the LED lights and all of the customizable options. It can be linked to an echo dot for more personalized options. And it is clacky which I wanted when searching for a good mechanical keyboard. It is satisfying clicking the keys. I type somewhat fast at 80 wpm and I use headphones for work. The clacky doesn't bother me since my headphones are noise canceling. Others around may be able to hear. Perfect for me when I need to be left alone to work! I keep my wireless keyboard handy for while on meetings via computer so nobody is bothered by my multi tasking. Otherwise I mute my meeting. There are so many customizing options that it will take me a little time to truly reap all features this keyboard has to offer. But so far I love it and reasonably priced. Also my fingers/hands/ wrist don't feel tired or strained with typing.. key input is super easy.. I highly recommend!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars It's a Razer Keyboard and it just works!",
                "reviewText": "Okay it has RGB, a lot of RGB and fully customizable with many aps, including of course Razer Chroma Studio. It works well with MSI Dragon Center and is compatible with many games that support Razer products, such as; Apex Legends where the keyboard goes ballistic as menus swipe rapidly, so does the colors on the keyboard. I mean these effects can be turned off but they are fun and can be a conversation starter to anyone who sees your setup for the first time. Having said that it types pretty good, not the greatest experience for obvious reasons; because well it's very tactile and more aimed at gaming. It's clicky but not as loud as you may think, still loud enough but satisfying, at least to me. However others may prefer a more linear switch. Razer greens are like blue switches, but far smoother, giving you just the right tactile feedback you would expect. There are some moments though where you can lose a little control and edge if your in the heat of a battle, which is common with any keyboard but with stock keycaps this is all too common. Razer does however sell better caps and if you value your symbols \"lit\" under F1 through F12 and under your numbers 1 through 10 (- or =) you might want to pick up that kit. It's not a horrible experience but it can be irritating in certain scenarios. Other than that the build quality of this keyboard is top notch, well weighted with heavy quality materials that just feel good. The lighting is bright, but note Razer switches only light up on the top and there is a white background under the keys that actually spread the lighting evenly throughout the keyboard, giving it a more Tron like glow. Individual keys can be custom lit, even the Razer insignia on the bottom, which to me is really cool. There's not much more to say other than this is a mid-range option from Razer that has a real premium feel and will probably feel even better with custom keycaps. I'm impressed with the board overall and it feels like it will hold out well over time. I would highly recommend picking it up. 4 out of 5.",

I\u2019m not a gamer, but I do a great deal of typing, and the mechanical \u201cgreen tactile and clicky\u201d keys are perfect for my work.The only drawback is the secondary functions on the keys. I\u2019m talking about the ones with two symbols (such as the numerical and punctuation keys). The secondary symbols are not back lit. They're printed on a black key with a relatively dark gray paint. They're hard to see in a dimly lit room. Not being a touch typist, I have to stop and look for the secondary functions. A minor inconvenience. I hope that is addressed in future versions.Other than that, it\u2019s a sturdy keyboard with the proper heft to prevent it from sliding on the desktop. It looks and feels well made. The power cable comes out of the center back originally, but you can adjust it to come out of the back on either side, depending on your desktop configuration.For the price, it\u2019s hard to beat. If you\u2019re looking for the great mechanical keyboard, I couldn\u2019t recommend the Razor Blackwidow too highly.UPDATE 6/29/20: It's been over a month and not one problem. Still clicking along perfectly. My motto is \"Take the negative ratings with a grain of salt.\"",

                "reviewText": "[Review of the Blackwidow 2019 basic version, w/Razer Green switches]This is actually my second Blackwidow. The first one I bought was the Dragon Age special edition one with Cherry MX Blue switches. I am happy to say that this revised version is better than its predecessor from a decade ago.The 2019 Blackwidow's body has a sturdy matte black plastic finish with minimal/no flex when you try to bend the keyboard. The lower middle part of the keyboard has a glossy section that will leave fingerprints, but it shouldn't be a concern since one will be rarely touching that portion of the keyboard.The keycaps that come with this keyboard are ABS, which is a shame. That means that your finger oils will stick to the keys and it's going to be noticeable quickly. At this price point, you can expect the keyboard to come with PBT keycaps from certain brands.Typing and gaming with these Razer Green switches feels great. It's comparable to Cherry MX Blue. If you're coming from a membrane keyboard or a softer, linear mechanical switch, once you get used to the actuation force of these keycaps (it takes a few minutes for most people), your typing speed will go back to normal. These switches are quite loud, which is not everyone's cup of tea. I personally do like the auditory feedback in combination with the tactile bump.Razer Synapse, the software you'll need to access a lot of lighting features, is a mixed bag. There's a bit of a learning curve to it, but once you get it, you'll have tons of options to customize the RGB in your peripheral. One of the coolest features is the custom lighting profiles you get when you play certain games. Synapse needs to be constantly updated and that can be a bit annoying when you also have to restart your computer after the update. There's also the fact that you may need to download additional software, but only if you want Synapse to work with things like Phillips Hue.In short, if you don't mind forfeiting the extremely customizable (and kinda fun) Razer RGB, you can most likely find a more affordable keyboard with the same quality, if not better. Keep in mind that with the Blackwidow, you're paying extra for the software experience and the Razer name brand.",
