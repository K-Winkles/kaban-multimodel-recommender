Like having the the little notches on the F and J key caps is kind of a weird feeling when almost all of the keyboards that I had used in the past has had the little nubs so that I could easily orientate myself on the keyboard without looking down at the thing,. but its not that big of a problem. And the second creature comfort that id like to have on the keyboard is the keys being translucent where the print of the key letter is so that I dont have to keep a small light near me to quickly glance at the keyboard to see where my finger is resting.",

                "reviewText": "I can't believe the home keys \"F\" and \"J\" not have any tactile bumps on them to align your hands without looking at the keyboard. This is a horrible omission and makes this product useless to me. Maybe some of you won't care, but as a touch typist this is unacceptable. There are some replacement keycaps, but the red ones are for specific keys and don't address that issue. I would strongly suggest they add F and J keys with tactile bump on them for touch typists.The lighting effects on this keyboard are impressive (although a little more brightness would be appreciated). There are many lighting patterns to choose from but the manual was not clear on how to change them. Pressing FN+ 0...9 goes through one set and then FN+[PrtScrn] has a different set. The FN + arrow left/right didn't really do anything as the manual suggested. And I could see no \"APP\" key on the keyboard.Sadly for me, on the first item I received the \"W\" key was unresponsive, working maybe 1 in 20 presses. I returned/replaced and received a second item and all functions work as expected. Even working as designed, I don't think I would want to use this product on a daily basis the feel / travel / sound of the keys was not pleasant",

                "reviewText": "This keyboard has issues that make it a very bad purchase. Due to poor molding of the keycaps there is little or no way to view the inconsistent, tiny and thin key nomenclature in low ambient light. There is nothing that can be done short of replacing all of the key caps. This is not an RGB keyboard! There is no illumination through the key caps, only under the key. To complicate the use of this keyboard, the instructions are terrible, at best. There are a lot of useless safety references, company information and very little about the functionality of the keyboard that customers really need to know.",
