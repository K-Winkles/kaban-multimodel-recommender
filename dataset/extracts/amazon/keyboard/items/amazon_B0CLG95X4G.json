                "reviewText": "Red dragon UCAL PRO K673 is a Mechanical gaming that provides a high-end user experience at a low budget price. My previous keyboard before this one was the Corsair k70 which is a great budget keyboard, however, the membrane keys drove me nuts after a while. This keyboard even being $10 cheaper at the time of writing this review, I was surprised that this keyboard feels like $150 Razer Blackwidow Ultimate maybe even better. The actuation required to press down each key is less than a membrane keyboard. This allows for longer gaming sessions, less cramped fingers/hands, and faster response times. I mostly use this keyboard in wireless mode and the latency is non-existent on 2.4GHZ, have yet to try Bluetooth but I am sure it's good as well. Overall they hit one out of the park with this product and I HIGHLY recommend it over their other budget option the k530 or whatever it is. These keyboards have sound dampening and the typing/gaming experience is better on this version. Also, the 75% reduced size makes it perfect for smaller setups or gaming setups in general as it is more efficient to use less space.The keyboard also features hot-swappable keys and fully customizable LED and they are BRIGHT!| Positives |- Mechanical Keyboard- Pre-lubed MX CHerry Red style keyboard switches- Low Fatigue- High-quality materials/weighty/great keycap feel/fast typing response- Unique design/coloration- Media Controls/Knob- The price is incredible for what you get- Long Battery Life- Fully Functional no compromise with reduced key layout- Fully Customizable/hot-swappable keys/Macros/LE- Height is adjustable in 3 ways| Negatives |- No wrist wrest included- Instructions are awful but you wont need any- Keys are less white than what is shown in the picture but still looks amazing| Verdict |4.5/5*BUY IT - If you made it to this part of the review then let me save you the trouble of thinking and deciding. Buy this keyboard because anything else at this price might \"satisfy\" you but if you would've tried this keyboard and someone told you it was $120 they might believe you because the quality is above and beyond what you would normally get.",

                "reviewText": "I have bought some Redragon products before, like the K530 and K621, and they either felt cheap or had functional issues, undoubtedly giving me a poor impression of their quality. However, today, I purchased the K649, and it has completely changed my perception of Redragon products. This keyboard not only feels incredibly comfortable to use with a pleasant typing sound, but its design is the standout feature. The transparent black keycaps with gold-colored lettering allow the LED lights to shine through beautifully, creating a stunning effect reminiscent of various colored night lights. It's truly visually appealing.The only downside is that there are some scratches, Additionally, the keyboard's two adjustable support modes at the back are very convenient.Considering its current price, I believe it offers excellent value for money, and I can confidently say it is the most perfect keyboard I have ever purchased so far.",

I thought it had to be cheap or cut some sort of corners. But an entire keyboard length inter layer rubber sound reducing gasket? I had to try it.Right out of the box the keys were silky smooth, glided straight down with a light press, and sounded absolutely amazing. It has over 15 color modes and some of them genuinely make the keyboard feel \"alive\" in the way it responds to pushes.If you're skeptical because it's not \"Logitech\" or \"Corsair\" or someone else that's reputable I can promise you that for $70 you will NOT be disappointed. It comes with spare switches, key cap puller, fantastic color modes, Bluetooth on multiple devices, 2.4ghz dongle and it's wired and wireless!",

                "reviewText": "I am usualy a Clicky type mechanical switches when it comes to mechanical keyboard, I like the blue switches. I was going after either cherry mx blue or razer green or any click switches. However most keyboards that were 75% size were very expensive. So I stumbled randomly on the red dragon elf pro, i saw it costs around 80 bucks but then I realized it had linear type of switches and i was disappointed. But then I checked out an review on youtube and when the reviewer showed how the keyboard sounded when I used to type, i noticed it had a nice pop and click to it for a linear switch. So I said let me order it and try it worst come to worst I will return it. I got the keyboard and fell in love with how satisfaying the clicking is even if its liner mechanical switches. Even tho iam not a fan of the transparent key caps as with rgb i cant see the letters clear. However i left the efect that they light up for a moment after pressed and thats fine. Also the gold letters look very slick on the caps with the black color keyboard. Iam definately keep the keyboard, I might even buy another one as this is one is a real winner. Btw i was using before this one the Razer Blackwidow TKL tournament edition RGB which was still a tad too wide for me and while i like it alot the Elf Pro is superior.The elf pro is really well rounded keyboard with very very nice clicks. There is just something about this keyboard that makes you fee that you are on a whole other level.",

Sono rimasto sorpreso, non per gli RGB o gli switch in particolare, ma per la quantit\u00e0 di funzioni che ha a disposizione, che per necessit\u00e0 mi hanno inizialmente attirato.Sulla tastiera trovate tutte le funzioni multimedia che alcuni danno per scontate (ma che in molte tastiere sono scomodi da usare oppure non esistono proprio), oltre ad un sacco di personalizzazione degli RGB che si possono cambiare di modalit\u00e0 (e ce ne sono tante), colore, e velocit\u00e0. Unici difettini per me sono il fatto che la luce del caps lock non sia sul tasto vero e proprio, ma \u00e8 un led a parte, il fatto che la rotella del volume aumenta o diminuisce di 2 o di 4, a random (boh) e che i tasti non sono semi trasparenti, non passa quindi nessuna luce attraverso i keycaps.Ah e il layout \u00e8 inglese, quindi occhio (io ho acquistato consapevolmente, sapendo che avrei dovuto adattarmi)Per il prezzo avete un cavo bello lungo che ha un adattatore sopra che va da type-c ad USB (anche se non lo userei per la tastiera, \u00e8 un cavo bello comodo da avere), due accessori per smontare la tastiera (gli switch sono pure hot swappable) e quattro switch rossi, in caso se ne rompesse qualcuno. Direi che per il prezzo pagato (80\u20ac) \u00e8 valsa la pena rispetto ad altre tastiere che si vedono in giro.",
