Especially given the Ctrl/Shift/etc and Spacebar, etc. The legs are dual-position for height, and the keys themselves have a nice \"ka-chonk\", not really the full mechanical \"click\", but it works perfectly for an entry level and not-too loud Mechanical!

I do a lot of gaming on mouse and keyboard and this one does not disappoint. The button presses are clean and concise. The lighting looks great and has many different adjustments that let you customize it and change it easily. The price seems a bit high when compared to other keyboards in the class but you also need to consider the custom keycaps it uses and how great they look. I have another more expensive keyboard that I prefer for gaming but I switched the 'enter' and 'space bar' keycaps with this one because they look really cool. Overall this is a great keyboard and for the right price I definitely recommend it for gaming or even just everyday typing tasks.",

With that though it is a little strange to have backlighting that doesn't shine through the symbols on the keys. The symbols are mostly well printed but a few of them have breaks in the symbol but are still readable. The lighting is bright and has quite a few different styles that are easy to change with the function button and then using the alternate labels on the arrow and above the arrow keys.The key switches in this keyboard feel high quality with a moderate amount of activation distance, lower than average sound, and an otherwise responsive feel to them. This keyboard works well for both gaming and typing.",

I haven't stopped using it since the day I pulled it out of the box. I'd totally buy more colors if available in the future, but I really like the pink. It fits the rest of my setup perfectly.",

                "reviewText": "I've only been using the Hexgears GK715 keyboard for a few hours, but I'm already really impressed with it. It's a great keyboard for both gaming and typing, and it's also very affordable.The first thing I noticed about the GK715 is that it's very well built (built like a tank, actually). The case is made of high-quality aluminum, and the keycaps are made of ABS plastic. The keyboard feels very solid and sturdy, and it doesn't flex at all when I'm typing or gaming.The GK715 has a full-sized layout, which means that it has all the keys that you need for everyday use. Nevertheless, it's still compact enough to fit on a relatively small desk. The keyboard also has a high-quality USB-C cable, which makes it easy to connect and use.One of the things that I really like about the GK715 is the hot-swappable switches. This means that I can easily swap out the switches for different ones if I want to change the feel of the keyboard. I've been using the Gateron Browns that came with the keyboard, and I'm really happy with them. They're tactile and smooth, and they're perfect for both gaming and typing.The GK715 also has a lot of features that are great for gamers. It has full N-key rollover, which means that all of your keystrokes will always register, even if you're pressing multiple keys at the same time. The keyboard also has a polling rate of 1000Hz, so it can register your keystrokes very quickly.Overall, I'm really impressed with the Hexgears GK715 keyboard. It's a great keyboard for both gaming and typing, and it's also relatively affordable. If you're looking for a new keyboard, I highly recommend checking it out.Here are some pros and cons of the Hexgears GK715 keyboard:Pros:Well-builtDecent valueHot-swappable switchesFull N-key rollover1000Hz polling rateComes with a detachable USB-C cableABS keycaps that are made exceptionally well and compare favorably to more expensive PBT keycaps.Cons:The keyboard is not backlitI know that ABS keycaps are often viewed as inferior to PBT keycaps, but I was really impressed with the quality of the ABS keycaps on the GK715. They're thick and durable, and they have a nice, smooth texture.Overall, I think the Hexgears GK715 keyboard is a good value for the price. It's well-built, affordable, and has a lot of features that are great for gamers. If you're looking for a new keyboard, I highly recommend checking it out.",
