                "reviewText": "I love this keyboard! Even though I'm using it with a Mac and I had to get an adapter to plug it into the Mac, I think it was worth it for how cool this keyboard looks, how comfortable it types and that it's totally plug and play, no software or driver to install.It's a standard DOS ASCII keyboard, meaning where a Mac has a Command key this has a WIN key, and where a Mac has an Option key this has an Alt key. The usual iOS shortcuts work for screenshotting and such.There's a subtle clack as keys are tapped but it's not unpleasant or noisy. Keys can be easily popped off and back on for cleaning and a cleaning brush is included. Seems well made with no rough edges, cracks or chipping.My only complaint is that the key text is applied with clear decals instead of being painted or embossed on, I worry the decals may come off with heavy use.Otherwise, a great buy!",

I selected blue and am very pleased with it. It works great and I now prefer it over my work-issued keyboard. It makes a satisfying sound when typing. It is easy to plug in and unplug, which I need to do frequently when taking my laptop back and forth to work - and it always starts working again when plugged back in.",

They make a nice clock sound, and the keys feel super smooth to use (if that makes sense lol). The only issue I\u2019ve had is the last light button doesn\u2019t light up, it\u2019s got a lock above it but I don\u2019t know what it goes with\u2014 I think it\u2019s just broken. The cap and number lock work and light up just fine! If you\u2019re looking for a cute and aesthetic keyboard for casual use, this is a great pick!",
