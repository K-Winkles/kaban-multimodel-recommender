The multitude of rainbow effects are gorgeous, though you can't seem to just choose one single color, it's all or none with this keyboard, but I'm OK with that.It's compatible with just about everything I can think of! I've used a port adapter to connect it to my usb-c devices and it still works like a dream! It works with my tablet , my phone, and even my ancient laptop! I am absolutely thrilled with this keyboard. If you want something pretty, sturdy, and extra noisy, this is the one for you!",

My only complaint is hoe loud the keys are, but in very sensitive to that. I ordered a new set of switches and I'm hoping that helps. I absolutely adore the different settings for the leds, and the key caps are stunning. The keyboard makes my desk look very cool when it's just sitting there, and even cooler when I'm typing. My favorite setting is the single key glow when you press. It makes writing papers and emails extra special.EDIT: I just replaced the switches for a quieter clear tactile, and I like this keyboard infinitely better. The clickiness was getting a little annoying, and I'm very happy now with the sound and feel. I adore the look and feel of the keycaps and now I love the sound and feeling of pressing in even more. I could type all day on this thing! Half the reason I edited the review was so I'd have an excuse to type!",

In the past, I purchased a keyboard and had to return it because the numbers on the right were too close together. I needed a number keyboard because I do a lot of data entry.

I\u2019m just pretty bummed about the setting. 3 stars seems too low but 4 too high in my opinion and rating as a 3 was unfair.",
