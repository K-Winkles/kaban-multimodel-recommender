Keys kept getting stuck while typing, the keyboard legs fell off and the mouse would not connect unless you took action.Not even worth the gas taking it to the ups store to send back--so I just smashed it against my desk. That at least gave me some satisfaction****UPDATE*****10/28 After this review posted, the seller contacted me to resolve the issue. Even though the return window had closed, they still at their expense had a replacement keyboard sent out from Amazon. I was not expecting it, but they proved they care about the customer above and beyond what's expected. The replacement keyboard seems to work fine, so I am updating here and changing my rating. I appreciate good quality customer service as much as anyone, especially these days.",
