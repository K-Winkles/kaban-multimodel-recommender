I also like to use it as my main purse because this bag I just cross it over my shoulder and it is always with me. I wont set it somewhere and leave it. Now just to get it in different colors.",

                "reviewText": "Bag capacity: I have a similar bag, but it is smaller and can barely hold my large cell phone (Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra). However, this bag easily hold my cell phone, a 10,000Mah battery pack and charging cable with ease. As the bag's dimensions are 8.6 inch x 6.25 inch, it is certainly large enough to hold these items and my car keys.Pockets: Inside the main compartment there is a mesh divider to separate your items. Likely it is good for flatter items to put inside the mesh pocket or smaller bulky items. There's also the outer pocket with a separate zipper. Overall they are roomy, but I would recommend the bag for more rectangular shape items. Bulky items or round shaped will make it more difficult to hold and zipper up.Zippers: are easy to pull open and closed, the pull ties make it simple to find the zippers. There was no problem using the zippers at all, they did not stick or catch when using them.Strap: The strap is easy to adjust and any slack is held down with a thick elastic band. There is a clasp at the side of the bag to open the strap and avoid having to lift the bag over your head. The clasp is super simple to press the button to open up and closes just as easily an securely. There were no issues closing the clasp. I'm 5ft, 9in tall, and I found a comfortable length of a little more than half the strap. So it will certainly be long enough for a much taller person to use.Usage: I really enjoy using the bag. It is the perfect size to hold my daily essentials (phone, battery charger, cable, wallet and keys). I have been wearing the bag in two ways, either with the bag on the front of my body and on my back. With it's compact size, I can also wear the bag under my jacket and it is barely noticeable... very discreet. My only downside is that the bag tends to tilt towards the middle of my body due to the weight of the items inside. Tightening the strap does help a little. Otherwise, this is my new daily use bag.",
