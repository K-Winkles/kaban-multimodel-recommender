It\u2019s lightweight but very roomy. Lots of well sized compartments for all my stuff and then some. Zippers work great, easy to zip and unzip. Strap is comfortable and can be switched to right or left shoulder. The charging port isn\u2019t necessary but doesn\u2019t get in the way. I tried three other bags before finding this one, sent back the other three, this one is a keeper. Highly recommend.",

It is the perfect size, not too big not too small. Very roomy and the pockets are nice and deep. It fits my wallet, phone, charger cord with block, ear buds with case and snacks. The pockets on the sides hold water bottles just fine. I cannot express enough how well made this bag truly is. As far as the USB connect on the side, it is an empty space but I didn't buy it for that and from what I've read, there's a way to make that work for you. This bag is perfect.",

I would much rather feed my own cord through the port. The second bag I ordered came with a cord that could NOT be removed, so you\u2019ve got a cord on the inside (taking up needed space!) and then an excess cord (that you provide to connect to your phone) on the outside and it\u2019s just way too much cord. I wish there was a way to specify that I wanted this bag without the cord. Just the plastic piece on the side of the bag where I can feed my own cord through it is JUST fine.(Keeping my battery pack on the inside and then feeding my own cord through the opening to charge my phone, resting in the net pocket.The bag without the cord is PERFECTION for traveling.",

Bag is comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Bag hold quite an impressive amount of stuff. Would recommend. Only thing to improve on is the strap. Wish it could be made a little smaller. I have a small torso so probably not an issue for most.",
