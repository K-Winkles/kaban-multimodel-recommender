I use it for the purpose of a three night bag, you could probably comfortably fit four days worth of clothes plus toiletries comfortably in the bag. If you need more then that get a bigger bag.It\u2019s great for $60, wish it had more pockets but has more then enough space for what I need. It\u2019s lightweight when you\u2019re carrying it but it also is a very strong bag.I\u2019ll have it for several years as it\u2019s durability and size were exactly what I was looking for.",
