                "reviewText": "this replaced a wilson backpack that provided good service for years, until i finally decided to quit on the busted zippers. this bag is definitely larger. it holds three racquets easily, although i had to add velcro to the strap to accommodate the third racquet. i also cut out the small harbinger clip i use to hang my car key. maybe not a priority for others, but very useful to me. it\u2019s something i believe the developers should incorporate into future versions. in addition to five hats, six balls, an unopened can, towel, sunglasses and various smaller items such as dampeners, tape, sun block, biofreeze, etc., the bag leaves ample room for a pair of shoes or another large item. seems like a quality product that met my needs.on the negative side, i\u2019m not a fan of the outside cords. i may cut them off. the advantage is they keep the bag somewhat contained, otherwise it would be even larger. if anything, the bag is somewhat larger than ideal, at least for my needs.",

                "reviewText": "This is a big tennis bag that has tons of space inside. My previous tennis bag was a bit more compact (which I liked), but they had the tennis racquet section on the exterior, which meant I was constantly at risk of hitting people with my racquet. I knew I needed a new bag that was designed to hold the racket adjacent to my back and this one fit the bill. (For reference, one of my photos shows my smaller old bag adjacent to this bag, which is larger--some may like that, as it can easily hold two racquets). This tennis bag is made of sturdy fabric with a waterproof exterior. It is extremely roomy with several large interior compartments. It just has a couple (small) cons:CONS (both minor, but worth noting):1) One important thing it is missing is a flat zipped pocket for holding smaller things like a measuring tape for the net, sunscreen, and a cell phone. With this bag, there are no smaller external compartments (save for a couple of mesh compartments on the sides for water bottles). This is a negative for me, as my cell phone gets lost inside the larger internal sections. I wish they would make all tennis bags so that there is a smallish external pocket that can hold a cell phone and possibly a mask. I'm going to invest in a small makeup-sized bag for those items so they can be more easily located inside the bag. But this is not ideal, as when my cell phone rings, I'll still be digging into the bag for an iternal zipped bag each time to hunt for it. A simple additional external flat-zipped pocket would have made this perfect. Hopefully, they'll address that issue in the next round of designs.2) I'm on the fence about how I feel about the fence hook (pun intended). I love the idea of being able to hang the bag on a fence when the benches on the courts are damp. But, the way the hook is designed means it can tickle my back when I have to ride my bicycle with my tennis bag. The zippers all seem smooth, however in a couple of places they are not sewn evenly ( my grandmother was addressed designer and taught me to pay attention to these sorts of things, as unevenly sewn zippers are often sources of subsequent problems).Overall, this bag is quite good and sizable, and with a few changes, it would be worthy of five stars rather than just four stars. I'm hoping the manufacturers are reading thee comments and will adjust the next version of this bag to address these issues.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m using this LARIPOP bag for pickleball, but it could also be used for other paddle sports, as a laptop bag, carry-on bag or simply as a backpack. It\u2019s large enough to carry at least two pickleball paddles, a few balls, a pair of shorts, leggings or lightweight pants, a shirt, a towel, a pair of tennis shoes and more. The paddle storage area zips completely over pickleball paddles so the handles aren\u2019t exposed. There are several compartments on the interior of the bag which are great for keeping items organized and can be used for storing accessories such as paddle weights, grip tapes and edge tapes, along with a wallet and other small personal items. The zippered compartment at the front of the bag is good for keeping a mobile phone handy. A cap or sun visor can be placed into the criss crossed expandable cords on the front. A unique feature on this bag are the adjustable straps on both sides of the bag that can hold rolled up towels or shirts. Mesh pockets on each side of the bag will hold water bottles and/or balls. Comfortable to wear as a backpack, but can also be carried on one shoulder or by the padded handle at the top of the bag. This bag is made of water repellent polyester and is very lightweight for its size. Overall a great looking, well made bag with many storage options at a very good price.",

                "reviewText": "I got this for a young granddaughter and her mom raves about it. There are many compartments to keep things separate. It is comfortable for her to \"wear\". It's lightweight and flexible and the straps easily adjust to the size of the child. The separate shoe compartment is great for outdoor muddy fields such as soccer. The many compartments also make it much easier to find things compared to bags with one large compartment. There is a fence hook and a place to store a water bottle. The bag seems well built and I am sure it will last quite a while. It seems that the manufacturer read a lot of reviews to find out what people want in a bag and listened to what people want. You won't regret buying this bag.",

It has tons of room for storage and the shoe compartment is great for anyone on the go who needs to change from work to play. There are 4 zippered compartments for all your containment needs. Plenty of room for shirts, shorts, tennis balls and all other accessories. There are even mesh compartments for water bottles or sports drinks.The materials are excellent. A little stiff a first, but you can tell this bag will be durable. I got the pink bag and it really pops out. Anyone that is fan of pink will love how this bag looks. Lastly the zipper and seams appear to be constructed very well. No issues with stuck zippers. Very nice addition to my sport back pack collection. 5 stars.",
