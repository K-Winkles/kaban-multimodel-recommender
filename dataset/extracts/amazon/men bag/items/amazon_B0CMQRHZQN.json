At the size it is, I could pack more than a week\u2019s worth of clothes and stuff in it.The fabric and construction of the bag are fine. The various pockets and straps are helpful for organizing and carrying.I do wish it had some stabilizer in the shoe compartment to help it hold its shape. That and a zipper around the bottom to compress the shoe compartment when it\u2019s empty would be improvements I would have liked.",

All zippers are smooth. There are several non-zippered pockets in the main compartment (fine if the bag stays upright) and a larger waterproof zippered pocket that is meant for wet items (bathing suit, etc).It has padded canvas handles. It also comes with a small basic toiletry bag and an option to attach a decent shoulder strap.",

                "reviewText": "This bag is made well and holds a lot of stuff to be considered a size medium. I like that this has metal clips for the strap because those tend to last a little longer. I also like that the strap has fairly decent padding on it. This bag seems pretty durable to me and the asking price seems fair. I think it's a nice weekender bag and would recommend it to others.",

                "reviewText": "This travel bag is lightweight but sturdy. It is made of canvas. My favorite aspect of this bag is all the pockets. You have 2 on the end. 3 small pockets on the inside for toiletries or socks. Then a larger pocket for swim suits or dirty clothes and finally a shoe compartment on the bottom. The strap has a small shoulder cushion. Decent at best. The toiletries bag is small and basic.",

The bag is fairly sturdy, maybe not as thick as it could be overall but I think it will be pretty durable. It has handles and a shoulder strap which is nice for versatility. And it comes with a bonus little matching toiletries bag, very convenient.",
