                "reviewText": "The Dakuly Gym Duffle Bag for Women Men 40L is a very good size to carry and not wrestle with because it is too big. The 40L is big enough to pack a few sets of clothes in. It has several zippered compartments which is useful to put things you want separated or organized or be able to access quickly without digging through everything. The material is thick, heavy duty, and washable with a rag inside and out. It is sewn very well (including stress points reinforced) and has good hardware (buckles and zippers). The strap is padded and long enough, however, when I had the bag fully packed, the buckles squeaked as the bag moved when I was walking. There are sewn in external straps on the front side for attaching things, like a rolled up jacket. The added pouch is a nice bonus and can be used for things other than toiletries For some, the end zippered compartment for shoes is lined like a pocket to keep the shoes apart from the contents in the main compartment of the bag. I don't normally pack shoes in such a carry on and like to organize my stuff in the end pockets so I can easily retrieve items, especially when the bag is under the seat in front of me, so it was more annoying to have the extra material and try to make the compartments be more defined and separate--it would be more versatile and awesome if the extra liner material was designed in a way that it could be secured and zipped/snapped together to make the end pocket small like the other end of the bag. Overall, it is a really nice bag.",

A big plus for me is that most gym bags have god-awful gigantic logos. This is a very elegant bag without a big company advertisement logo on it, which is a huge selling point in my opinion. There are a lot of little extra compartments, straps, and accessories with this bag too. Great purchase!",

                "reviewText": "First off it came taped up like someone has returned it. See first picture.Second this thing is BIG and normally that's a plus, right? In this case, no. I ordered the bigger size, yes, but I specifically used the measurements listed to make sure I wanted that size. Turns out I when I opened it up it was actually more like 2-3 inches extra per side so length was basically 24 inches and height was 13inches. Wayyyyy off the description (it was 21.3\" for length in the listing and 11.5\" height so yea way off). I just needed a good gym bag to hold my shoes, clothes, bathing essentials, towel, etc etc etc. this is just unusable for that for me... because even with everything in it it still had so much room.If you need this for traveling or sports team stuff then this will be a win.Thirdly...I'd like to mention the zippers are iffy at best. The side pockets both got stuck as soon as I opened them. Inside zippers were great but something in the hemming or fabric was preventing the side shoe and other side pocket from closing properly. I had to really make sure it wasn't getting stuck every time. So obviously buy at your own risk with that. Maybe it was just this bag.Update: Returned bigger bag and ordered smaller one. The small one is actually 21\" long. So measurements are definitely off. However the zippers on this one are fine. My only complaint would be, like others, where there's plastic parts where the shoulder straps attach. So can't speak to longevity. Will update once I use it. Fits all my gym stuff perfectly: shoes, towel, shower stuff, clean clothes, gym wear, protein bars, hair ties, glove, water bottle, etc etc. the small size is more than big enough.",

I like the shoe storage, big enough for my gym shoes and shower sandals. And it still has plenty of room for my gym clothes in the main section. I like all the other storage areas, some of which are for liquids or wet items like shampoo, soap, lotions, hairbrush, etc. The side straps are nice to hold my gym towel, although I usually just leave it on top of the bag. The little sleeve on the end is good for my water bottle. It is a pretty heavy duty material, not flimsy at all. And it is not a huge bulky bag, very easy to carry around. I'm very happy with this bag!",
