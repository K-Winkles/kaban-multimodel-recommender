Ended up in a wheelchair for a bit, then needed a walker & eventually a cane. Needed a cross body purse b/c the left arm was useless for weight bearing of any sort & still needed to get around but was unable to carry anything while using the Walker or the cane. It is a nice, medium weight nylon which would have been reasonably water resistant if I had needed it to be. I felt it was a good size for my needs-It has 2 really nice hidden/secure pockets if someone needed it for travel purposes (one inside the large compartment & one zippered one on the backside of the large compartment that is next to the abdomen), the other front pockets held keys, mints, chapstick w/a little room to spare, a woman\u2019s wallet fit nicely in the main pocket. The zippers are nice & sturdy. I did have a seam come loose but it was easily repaired. Not sure how well it would hold up to everyday hard use but for my purpose or a modest sized day/trip travel purse it was a reasonably priced bag.",

                "reviewText": "The bag is just as I expected, and I think the dimensions stated are probably highly accurate. Based on the photos (which I realized I might have misjudged) I expected it to be a little larger, but I knew from the dimensions that it was not. There are cute zipper pulls with stars on them, and many separate zipper compartments. There is a perfect convenient snap compartment on the front for your keys. It will fit one water bottle in the largest compartment, as long as it's not too big, but probably not two unless they were pretty small, and at that point, not much else is going to fit. (I wanted this for the gym.) There is a ventilation hole at the upper back of the bag I chose (black). Full disclosure, I haven't used it at all yet. My only disappointment is that it was shipped in what seemed to be the bag the item was packed in from the manufacturer - not a box, not a bag mailer. The bag was flimsy and could have easily been damaged in shipping, resulting in damage to the item (like another item I recently received was). The bag was transparent, you could see what it was. If you're ordering this as a gift and you want it to be a surprise, just be aware that it might not be.",

                "reviewText": "Cute bag, good small size. Lots of pockets and sections for different things. The zippers work well. However, the strap broke off after only a few uses. I used a zip-tie to make it last a little longer, a few months, but was definitely disappointed that it didn't last and broke so quickly. I put stuff in each pocket, would not say I overstuffed it, as all of the zippers easily closed.",
