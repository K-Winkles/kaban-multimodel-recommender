                "reviewText": "I'm going to tell you a little tale.I REALLY want an \"Indiana Jones\" bag. It's a WWII era British MKVII Gas Mask Bag, with a custom leather strap. I also needed a practical bag to carry my laptop and other notebooks and papers and things in. Unfortunately, my laptop was far too big to fit in an actual \"Indy Bag\", so I went about trying to find something that would a similar style. I came across this bag and thought I would give it a try! I bought a leather strap to use from right here on Amazon and I think it looks pretty similar! It's not exact of course, but its nerdy enough for me.The bag itself is pretty nice. It's made from durable canvas, and the strap it comes with is a nice canvas webbing. The strap is sewn on, and I was hesitant to cut it off to put my leather one on. I was able to just cinch it down as small as it would get and keep it tucked inside, just in case I need it later. The handle on the back is a little weird, but it is fine. I usually grab it by the strap anyway. It has a small zippered pocket hanging in the back of the main compartment, and that is handy for putting small loose items in. The main compartment is big enough for my MacBook plus folders, notebooks, comics, bills, and all the other stuff my \"Man Purse\" (I mean Indiana Jones satchel) can collect.There are two loose pockets in the front that are where the velcro from the cover flap attach to. I have stuff in there now, but it sort of makes me nervous having it all loose in there. I might get some little mini bags to put in there to collect those loose items and keep them from falling out. I also put a bit of foam at the bottom of the main compartment to keep my computer from hitting the ground when I place it in there.I may also add some magnetic clasps on the cover flap to keep the flap from coming undone. The velcro feels a little wishy-washy for my liking.So, to sum up:Durable construction. Needs some upgrades to be *perfect* for my use, but cost-effective enough to easily do that stuff myself without feeling ripped off.",

I had a messenger bag like this before that was actually quite heavy & cumbersome even without anything in it & this bag is NOT like that one. It\u2019s a good quality, well made bag! I love it! I\u2019m a dental instructor & have to walk around a large campus & walk to & from our dental lab every day/all day & this bag doesn\u2019t kill my back at all. It even has 2 pockets on the sides for my refillable, filtered water bottle & coffee tumbler. It has a zippered pocket on the inside also for pens/pencils &/or whatever small essential items you\u2019d need to take to work with you & has 2 pockets in the front for your car/house keys, wallet, cellphone, snacks etc...I don\u2019t carry my purse into work anymore, I just use this bag now. I suggest that you buy waterproof spray & spray this bag to make it the ultimate messenger bag like I did!!! I love it & it works perfectly for my needs!",

                "reviewText": "This is a great, heavy duty canvas bag, with lots of room.I got tired of modern fishing creels, so bought this with the understanding that I would make certain modifications. First, I put three metal grommet holes in the bottom, to drain water from all the fish I intend to put in it. Second, my dear wife put hook and loop closures on the two front pouches to keep them from spilling fishing goodies. Third, I put Scotch Guard water proofing on the back, which would rest against me. This last is probably not necessary, but might help a bit.I can attach such things as my grasshopper carrier to the metal hoops that hold the more-than-sufficient shoulder strap. One of the two bottle holders (on either end) will be for bait cans. I may attach a metal ring for my net -- the jury is out on that.I now have a great creel that is rugged creel that can carry up to 15-inch trout without bending them. Too bad someone does not sell something equal to this. (If someone decides to do so, I do expect a commission -- or at least a prototype.",
