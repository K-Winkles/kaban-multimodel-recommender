                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great overall, a couple flawed features",
                "reviewText": "I've had my bag for 1 week now and I've been very pleasantly surprised.I'll start with the cons because I've only noticed 2.1. Cheap unnecessary buckles on the flap. The actual fasteners for the flap are two magnetic snaps that are held on by the two buckles. The magnet snaps themselves are a little difficult to get back into place while wearing the bag but they hold really well once they're in place. The real flaw here is that the buckles are real and really cheap. The buckles look nice but don't actually serve a purpose, and because the pins are so loose the straps can slip out making the snaps useless and letting the flap fly up whenever the wind blows.2. Small bottle holder pockets Plastic disposable water bottles fit well enough, but you need to struggle to get a 20oz Gatorade bottle past the elastic. I wasn't able to fit my reusable Gatorade bottle(32oz) in the pocket at all.Everything else has been what I hoped for or better.Durability: I can't comment on durability yet but I haven't noticed any obvious weak spots like loose threads or strained seams.Comfort: 8/10 The strap and pad are far more comfortable than I expected for the price. I doubt there is a more comfortable one for this price outside of a thrift store. I do have to shift the bag from side to side pretty often but that comes with all shoulder bags. The bag itself is very light so any strain is almost entirely based on what you decide to carry in it.Functionality: 9/10 I don't know that they could have fit many more slots in this bag without defeating the purpose of having a smaller bag like this. The pockets are conveniently placed to be able to get what you need while wearing the bag. The main zipper can be difficult to reach if you have the bag under your right arm but it is easily shifted to the front or to your other side to access that compartment if needed. If it weren't for the magnet snaps being difficult to line up, I would've given it a 10/10.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars I heard it has pockets",
                "reviewText": "A lot of the reviews mention the pockets, and they are correct. There is a main compartment with a double zipper. Inside that is a divider, so you can put a tablet in or just be more organized. I can stuff a hat in this and probably even a thin hoodie. Then there is a medium pocket with it's own zipper near the main compartment, good for little things you want secure. These are inside the handles. Then the front has a smaller zipped pocket at the top. Inside this pocket are two padded pockets, great for a wallet or phone. This is where you could put a battery and run the charge cord through a reenforced hole. There are two longer pockets in front, one velcro and one zipper with it's own additional open pocket. I put sunglasses in the velcro and phone in the other. There is a large pocket with velcro on the back, nice for quick access. Then two side pockets. I fit a medium water bottle in with not much problem and a pepper spray in the other. I use this bag as a daily purse. It's a little larger than a medium-size purse but I'm happy with the room and weight. It sits upright and the handles make it easy to carry. It is mostly waterproof in that pouring a full glass on water on top would get wet inside the main compartment due to the double zipper, but it'll be great in the Oregon rain. The crossbody strap has a removable comfort shoulder piece. I have no complaints and I will be enjoying the ample pockets of this bag.",

                "reviewText": "Bag is a good size for me, meaning not too big. It is also well made and not expensive. The outside pockets were ok, well placed and sized. The non stretch pocket on the side, opposite umbrella pocket, is too tight to get much in. Also makes it hard to get something out.But the big problem is the three middle pockets. The zippers tend to sink into the bag so you don't know which is which. The pocket parts are in the main storage area so get in the way when you try to get something out. The main zipper also tends to sink into the bag so is hard to get to when your hands are full or you are in a hurry. I think those 3 zippers need to be stiff. Does not work well for me.A year later and I have to say I would not buy it again. Everything in the main pockets get mixed together and is hard to get to.",

                "reviewText": "I carry a bag around because I have some medical issues and I need access to certain thing every time I go out. I have like four other bags and this by far is my favorite. It has tons of room inside with a ton of different pockets, some zippered, some not ( on the inside pockets only). My strap however was broken right out of the bag. Took it out, put all my junk in it ( great cellphone holder too!), the second time I put it on to check the ease of using it and my bag dropped to the floor. Was pretty bummed but that goodness I had one that matched from my old bag and I use it now. Am going to try to get just a new strap because I don\u2019t want to send the bag part back. Well made, lightweight, waterproof, excellent storage. Will fit an iPhone 6s Plus or an iPhone 11 with room to spare. Easy to take your phone in and out of the bag. So far I\u2019m loving it. I would recommend this product Minus the broken strap , which was kind of ugly anyway. But you can take the shoulder strap that\u2019s Velcro\u2019s on, off. Other handles don\u2019t get in the way.",

                "reviewText": "This bag arrived in today's mail delivery. I wanted a vertical travel bag for travelling & this looks like it is perfect for me.Has lots of small pockets on the outside on the front, cell phone section, zippered larger pocket with a slip pocket on the front of that. with a zippered section that is a bit smaller & two foam pockets for delicate items & still room in front of that.Back has one Velcro compartment, a good size, side bottle holder & the other side would suit an umbrella or a torch for camping. Inside has a main compartment which has a division for a tablet with a padded back & a good space for items. The second zippered top has a smaller zip section/pocket for storage which I think is very handy.Two comfortable handles, with a good length shoulder strap for either a cross body or shoulder bag.I like the fact it has a cushion shoulder strap for comfort due to any excess weight that you might have along the way.Then there is the surprise part when the bag is zipped up on the top up can pull it up for extra height. It is big enough, has lots of pockets & feels very comfortable.Women's bags are way too wide for travel & this one as a vertical bag is just so much better.I love the fact it arrived before the ETA as I can thoroughly check it all out for my travels.So happy with this purchase.",
