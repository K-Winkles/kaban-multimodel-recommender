                "reviewText": "Update:I have since borrowed this bag for a trip out of town over the weekend and am adding a star because: I packed so much stuff in this thing! I had a bunch of bottled water, road snacks, chargers, plus 4 days worth of clothes.Even though it weighed a ton, it held up and the shoulder strap didn't cut into me at all.Original review: I bought this bag because it looked good, and my husband was taking my little red carry on for his business trips.Which is fine, but also conspicuously not his style. So I bought this because it looked handsome and it was inexpensive, and he wanted a duffel for 3 day trips.I should start my review by telling you that I've worked with leather and making leather bags & goods in the past, so I'm picky about construction and hardware.First impression is that the bag is heavy. That's normal for waxed canvas. I wasn't sure if this would be authentic waxed canvas, but it is. It feels like cotton duck that's had a paraffin coating.There's no oil / wax odor, so that's a big plus.I was concerned that the metal reinforcements would be largely decorative, but they're real.The leather is decent, and real.The zipper is heavy duty! Yes!I expected it to look like a tough bag, I didn't expect it to feel and function like a utility bag.Also it holds 3 days worth of clothes, toiletries, chargers perfectly. I'll update at some point of an actual photo of what it holds. It's got a typical weekender capacity.It's a decent bag. I am pleasantly surprised.Oh! One more thing. When you get it, it's dense and folded from shipping and looks less than attractive.Waxed canvas softens with warmth, so I stuffed mine with a few bed pillows and used a blow dryer on it to get it into shape. That way it didnt look like a smashed raisin when I gave it to him.",

                "reviewText": "I've been shopping for just the right duffel-type weekender for some time. My old American Tourister had finally fallen apart after many years of service but I was having trouble finding a good replacement. I keep wanting to go all out and purchase a Filson product but they don't seem to have the perfect size for my needs; either too small or too large and way, way expensive.In a pinch, I decided on this bag as a temporary measure for an upcoming trip. The price was so low I figured it might only last a trip or two but it would hold me over for the time being. Was I wrong. I've used it on about five trips so far (road trips not flights) and it has held up like a champ. The bag feels sturdy but its not heavy. The leather is slightly stiff which is helpful when packing it using both hands at once. Soft leather, though it feels nice, flops closed making it difficult to fill the bag without holding it open with one hand. This bag's mouth stays open like a canvas bag and I appreciate that. The zipper moves smoothly, the magnetic snaps hold tightly, the handles function as they should, and overall it looks like a more expensive, worn-leather bag. The size is perfect for me and can hold most everything I need for a three-day trip minus shoes. I don't like putting shoes in my bag as they take up too much room and they are dirty by nature even tho they each travel in their own shoe bag. Yes, I'm fastidious, so what? I have not used it during a rain storm so I can't say anything about water resistance, but I wouldn't be overly concerned about that personally.Now it's not perfect, the outer pockets don't expand and the inner pockets are just okay. There are no dividers but not many duffel bags have those anyway (I use soft packing cubes which fit nicely). The shoulder strap needs that cushion piece to keep it from digging in your shoulder but I can fix that myself. However, these are nit-picky criticisms for a bag of this price and hardly worth mentioning.So yes, I give this bag an enthusiastic five-star rating for looks, practicality, and value.",

                "reviewText": "The first thing I noticed was that the color wasn't really true to the image at all.. I wasn't thrilled about it but my travel plans didn't allow time for me to return it and get another, so I decided to keep it.I've had it for almost a year now and have used it a fair bit.. the fabric is heavy duty and hold up well.. the zipper however is absolutely garbage. It has legitimately popped open more times then I can count while closing it.. even if the bag isn't really full, you still need to compress the contents down and really have the fabric zip shut 100% at slack in order for the zipper to close without popping open.. it's sad actually because it's past the point where I can return it and I'll likely replace the bag soon due to this inconvenience..Edit... The seller contacted me after seeing my review. They asked for some pictures of the zipper issue, which I sent. They then promptly issued a full refund.. this is the first time a seller has taken it on themselves to message me and issue a refund without me asking for anything.. it's just good business and I can respect that. So I'm adjusting my rating based on the sellers efforts. Thank you",
