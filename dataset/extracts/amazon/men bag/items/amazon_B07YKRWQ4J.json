It was the perfect size, not too big but big enough to carry quite a few things. The bag itself seems to be of good quality with respect to materials and construction. I was especially happy to see that the zippers are sturdy and not the small, cheap plastic ones you find so often on items nowadays. they look like they will last a long time with use. Overall, I am quite happy with this bag and would recommend it to friends in need of an overnight bag.",

                "reviewText": "I frequently fly Avelo Airlines who charges $43 for a carry-on bag. I save money by using this travel bag as a free personal item instead of a carry-on. This Small Size bag is the exact length and 1 inch less in width than the maximum size they allowed in 2023. Actually I now see that Avelo increased their personal item limits in 2024, so you would be better to buy the Medium Size bag instead. But my Small Size bag can hold more than you think. If you are tight on space you can always wear your jacket or sweatshirt instead of packing it. The only criticism I have is that this bag does not have a firm bottom. However, the flexible bottom allows you to squeeze the bag when you need to. One reviewer said he cut out a cardboard bottom to insert in the bag.",
