Though it has a small profile, it's quite roomy-- I can fit 2 glasses cases, phone, wallet, keys, and some incidentals. My only complaint is that the strap rides from my shoulder up to my neck and is uncomfortable when it rubs against the skin. As for quality, it appears to be well made -- time will tell.I also wish you made it in grey AND that you included a key chain attached to the inside the bag.",

The middle , easy to access pocket fits comfortably 4 passports and it's deep enough to fit boarding passes without bending them . Behind that there is another Larger pocket for bigger items. On the back side there is a pocket that fits a medium size wallet. I like to hang my keys on the front hook using a carabiner.

During the year, many times I am not wearing deep pocket pants or shorts. I have lost $600 cash just in one incident. The bag is easy to use and small enough to not be a burden to carry. My phone, wallet and sketch book fits with more room to spare. Great value for the price.",
