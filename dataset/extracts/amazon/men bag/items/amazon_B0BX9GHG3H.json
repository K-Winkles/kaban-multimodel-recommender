                "reviewText": "I just got this yesterday, so I will probably come back and update this review after I've had it for a while. But so far, this bag has all the pockets I could ever need for all the things I carry with me daily, and a few extra for occasional items like my tablet.The fabric is nice and tough, so I don't feel like it's going to get a lot of wear and tear. The zipper lock is a nice perk, but not a necessary selling point for me. I'm pretty hard on bags/purses, so having something sturdy like this is a must.It does seem to be sufficiently water resistant if not waterproof, and the zippers also seem to be of good quality. They glide nicely and don't get caught up on the fabric anywhere. I also very much like that they are metal as opposed to plastic.The part that sold me on the bag is the strap though. It's wide and padded at the shoulder area, which is needed because I carry a lot in my bags. It helps distribute the weight more evenly and keeps the strap from digging into my neck/shoulder.But it's the clip/ring at the bottom of the strap that I like the best. You can clip it to either side, depending on which side you like to carry your bag on, which is nice. The ring it clips to is reinforced with a woven strap strap that's actually wide enough to handle the weight, and it's sewn to the bag itself with a reinforced double stitch.This part is especially important for me because I've had several bags where the ring was only attached to the bag with a flimsy strap of fake leather that separated and broke off in just 2 months of use. The fact that this one is so reinforced is exactly why I bought it. I have hope that this bag will be able to hold up to heavy daily use.",

The material alone makes it worth the value. However it's stiff, meaning it can be hard to get things in and out of it because the shape and the way it doesn't \"stretch\" at all. Other than this it's a great bag.",
