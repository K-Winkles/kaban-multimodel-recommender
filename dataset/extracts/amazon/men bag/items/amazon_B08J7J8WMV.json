                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this lightweight backpack for my daily commute to work in the city, and I must say I'm impressed with it so far. The backpack is incredibly light, making it comfortable to carry around. The texture and quality of the material used are promising, and I believe it will hold up well over time.What had me keep the backpack is how it accommodates the new Apple silicone 14 Pro machines. My laptop fits snugly with some room to spare for a potential laptop sleeve or case. Along with the laptop, I can comfortably fit my keyboard, trackpad, and chargers without any issues. The sling type design suits my preference for a sleek and minimalist bag that doesn't compromise on functionality. (The brand patch is also easy to remove)However, while there are enough openings and pockets for most items, you may find it beneficial to invest in an additional organizer to keep your smaller accessories in order (not a requirement).Despite this minor drawback, I can recommend this backpack, especially for developers or anyone looking to travel light. Its compact size combined with the ability to carry essential devices makes it an excellent choice.",

                "reviewText": "PROS:- The only side-open sling bag with tablet capacity I could find.- Fits all my daily needs, including an iPad Pro 11\u201d (12\u201d may or may not fit, it was tight with the Magic Keyboard on), chargers, multiple personal care items, phone, wallet, traveller\u2019s journal, etc.- Everything fits flat and carries very comfortably.- Has a loop to secure any excess strap.- Really like the mesh zip section in the front pocket.NEUTRALS:- The material is a lot thinner than I was expecting from Carhartt. Not terrible since this helps lighten it, but I was expecting thicker.- It has a plastic buckle. Wasn\u2019t expecting any different at this price point, but I prefer metal.- Collects dirt like crazy. I\u2019m not new to black bags, and this one feels like a magnet for dirt prints. UPDATE: I was proved wrong. It will hold some contrasting dirt occasionally, but it stays clean for the most part. This is updated to a non-issue.- UPDATE: The hidden pocket will only hold keys OR a phone, probably an iPhone 14 Pro Max at most. Wider phones may run into issues fitting (such as the Duo).CONS:- It definitely runs small! I wear a men\u2019s medium/women\u2019s large and have a large bust - there\u2019s only a few more inches of strap to expand it. I do tend to sit my packs lower, but even so I\u2019m concerned about being able to wear it with any sort of heavy jacket.- The iPad/tablet pocket is pretty tight for an 11\u201d iPad Pro, especially with a case. It can be awkward to maneuver in or out, especially with other items in the bag. (I\u2019m not convinced this is entirely a con, because it seems inevitable to have the bag keep its size/shape, which I love). But you won\u2019t be able to fit anything wider. UPDATE: I\u2019ve taken to just leaving my iPad out of the slot if I have a lot of other items in the bag because it\u2019s so awkward to get in. Hasn\u2019t been a problem doing this though, other than general organization.INFO:- I couldn\u2019t find ANY pictures of the interior pockets; I included some here. For those with vision impairment, the main pocket has a half-length padded tablet pocket on the back, and a half-length mesh on the front. The front pocket has a zippered mesh pocket across the length in the front and is otherwise open. There is also a \u2018hidden\u2019 fleece (?) lined side pocket for your wallet/phone/misc.CONCLUSION:- I love it. It\u2019s going to be my daily for on-the-go and hoping it has good longevity. UPDATE: Still my everyday bag. I love this thing.",
