Normally a zipper, the shoulder strap, or handles would have failed by now on any name brand bag I\u2019ve owned. I carry this bag daily and fly with it at least once a month, often more. I\u2019ve put this thing through abuse. Washed it in a machine a few times. And the strap stitching for the padding is the only thing that\u2019s broken, but it has not gotten worse in over a year, so I don\u2019t notice much.There is a LOT of good storage in this thing. Keeps by business cards, cords, computer, a change of clothes, sneakers, books, travel snacks, pens, self defense weapons, and charging cords/batteries all neatly in their own compartments.If you\u2019re on the fence about this bag vs a pricier name brand, get this one. The construction quality is head and shoulders over Targa and Samsonite bags I\u2019ve had.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this bag to replace an Amazon Basics laptop bag that I was using as a briefcase. Because I work 12-hour shifts plus commuting time, I need to be able to carry extra items to get through the day. The Amazon bag was quickly running out of room, so I looked at lots of other bags and settled on the KROSER laptop bag.I don't usually need to carry a laptop computer to work, so I use this bag for everything else. It easily holds a folded up light jacket in its larger compartment, even without using the expansion feature. It has lots of room; I haven't even used all the compartments and pockets yet, but they are there if I need them.The construction of the KROSER bag is pretty rugged. It is some kind of heavy-duty nylon, and the zippers are excellent. I am really impressed with the stitching. The bag is relatively lightweight compared to a leather briefcase, which I took into consideration when looking for a new bag.This is an excellent bag overall and I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "This is a large bag with many compartments & pockets, which I like. My Omen 17 laptop fits easily into the large back section, or into the large front section, with a little room to spare in either space. I read some reviews that said a 17.3\u201d gaming laptop will not fit into this bag. Well, Kroser makes an 18\u201d bag, and I believe they filled for my order for a 17.3\u201d bag with an 18\u201d bag. This was a smart decision, and I am happy about it.So far, the quality seems sufficient. I read some reviews that the zippers could get snagged at certain spots. That happeed to me a couple of times on day one, so I just backed up the zipper and ran it forward again a couple of times and the snag went away. I also read that some inner seams can fray. I will find out over time. However, for bags with perfect zipper action and seams that do not fray, you often pay twice a much. So, for the price point, I will say I am satisfied.The bag is well designed. It holds all my accessories and is easy to use. After careful consideration I am giving this 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "Certainly one of the best value for money briefcases that you will find on amazon, but may not be for everyone. I use this most of the days that I go to college where I place several notebooks, books, and my laptop. It is incredibly spacious and fits everything and even enough space in main compartment to put my sweater. There is a place to put laptop, however it's a little too big/loose for my 13in Laptop. I really like that there is space to put phone, wallet, cards, and pens. Everything that I need fits inside. I could even fit my 40oz water bottle in the main compartment.However, this brief case is extremely bulky and sometimes too much space. To be fair there is a zipper to extend it or make it slimmer, but it's not enough.If you only need a briefcase that is for a laptop and paper, this may not be the one. It's great and I will continue to use it, but just too bulky. Great for travel.",

                "reviewText": "I will be brief, oddly, but there's nothing to say other than this is a spectacular deal! It is priced wonderfully, it is sturdy, spacious, loaded with compartments, the expandability is incredible, the carry strap and handle are great, the padding excellent, and I absolutely love this 100%. You can carry a laptop, weekend outfits or more--depending--shoes, tablet, phone, chargers, pens, and pencils, it opens nicely for the airlines, and is the absolute best for the money, for sure!One small thing is the stitching on the thin, expanding fabric folds could be better. It almost looks like it was used and opened and closed a lot so the stitching is undone here and there. I wanted to send it back but totally believed it was not a used product but a slight error in design...either that or the stitching table where Florence and Marizio work was also being used as a party table for Tammy's going away party and maybe, just maybe, their table was the bar.I love this bag. You know how you spend an eternity making a decision on a simple purchase, then regret it because you keep seeing better things pop up all the time and wish you hadn't made such a stupid mistake?Well, I don't know what that's like, seriously, but I do know this was the right bag for me! Even with a little stitching faux pas. Yes, but I do hope they see this, too.Get one, it is great!",
