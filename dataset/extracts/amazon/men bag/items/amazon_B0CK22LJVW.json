The pockets are deep, so not ideal for smaller items as getting them out can be a challenge. Also, there is a large pocket on the outside of the padded section, useful for power banks, external HDD, etc.Under the flap are two large pockets that are very deep. And on the back is a zippered pocket, but it seems pretty narrow... useful maybe for travel documents, passports, etc.?The flap closed with two magnetic clasps. Said clasps are somewhat difficult to get to join together... I'm afraid they are not going to properly align and the bag will come flying open at some point. The buckles on the outside are non-functioning... decorative only.My biggest complaint, aside from the clasps, is that there are not more smaller pockets for business cards, etc.",

                "reviewText": "My husband is really happy to have this bag for his work laptop and riles that he has to transport between his office and home every week. It has a lot of lovely internal pockets for organization. It is clearly a PU bag and not leather- there are a lot of options for genuine leather bags that are not hugely more expensive than this bag but I do think this is a good price for a bag with so many different pockets and sections.My only complaint would be that I wish it had a longer strap for cross body wearing.",

It's obviously vinyl and doesn't look anywhere as dark in color.The closing tabs are not buckles, that's just for show. The tabs actually close with magnetic popper type clips.The inside is as described.All in all an ok bag for the money. You get what you pay for I suppose. Wouldn't order it again though. I would pay more next time to get the ' genuine ' look!",

The main compartment has a zipper to close it up, as well as the main flap. The leather on this is very nice and looks good. Inside is roomy, and easily holds my electronics plus notepads, pens, etc. There is also a removable key clip if you want your keys in your bag instead of your pocket.The bottom has small feet for setting the bag down without damaging the bottom, and it stands nicely when filled.",
