This backpack arrived in time and sealed with brand new with tags.I was amazed at the size of it for the price, it is a great bag worth every dollar. The material is strong and zippers are strong and secure the bag properly.I was able to store a Canon Rebel 3ti camera with a 200mm lens and a Canon AE1 as well, my wallet and my sunglasses case. The charging port worked perfectly fine and felt comfortable.The bag also came with an additional pocket on the sling where you can place other small items such as a wallet for example. The bag came with reflectors as well and it was easy to rotate from the back to the front giving you easy access to your items or simply to guard your belongings when walking on crowded areas.I was very satisfied with this purchase and it is definitely worth every dollar.",

Places where I don't need a huge diaper bag but just a few baby essentials and my wallet. This is perfect for that! I have lots of space to put a few diapers, a pack of wipes and then enough room for all of my stuff. I'm really happy with the purchase, it was exceptionally priced compared to others on the market. My only complaint is that the phone pocket is smaller than described. I thought my phone would fit no problem but I have to squeeze that puppy in there and then it won't zip all the way. Maybe with time and usage the material will loosen and have more give so I can zip it up. But that was the only thing I was upset about with this. It's really quite great!",

                "reviewText": "I have had a few of these bags in the past. I mainly love them for when I have to fly. You can fit about everything in them and get through TSA quicker (and without as much wardrobe changing). This bag offers great organization for packing all your little stuff (I even had my ipad stored in securely). Everything that I normally carry in my pockets fit easily and where I could get to it quickly. I used it in the rain as well and it repelled water well. The area for the battery was ample and worked great for my battery recharger. The earphone hole is great for listening without the worry of messing through the pockets. Also it didn't leak at all (to those cutting this STOP! There is a slit in there to fish the wire through). The straps switched to different position making it comfortable even when loaded up. Definitely a favorite I will go back for!",
