There are two ventilation holes in near the top of the bag, with one hole on each side to allow sweaty shoes to air out. The bag is also lightweight enough that I can unclip it, fold it up, and store it in my golf bag while on the course.",

Folds down when nothing is in it. It has plenty of space (I wear 10.5/11) in the main compartment for shoes plus a few extras if needed. There are also two zippered compartments on the sides to hold a few small things if needed. There is also a set of air holes embroidered into the bag so your shoes can dry out inside. If you don't have a shoe bag, this one seems fairly nice for the price.",
