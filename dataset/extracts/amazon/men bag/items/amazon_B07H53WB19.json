However, when I have used it, so far so good, no issues with the zippers, the snaps, and no interior or exterior issues. I'm very satisfied with my color choice (IN THAT IT MATCHED THE COLOR I PICKED). It's good for traveling, comfortable over the shoulder and I like it (personal preference). I plan on purchasing another one in the near future, just for personal used.Thanks,RJ",
