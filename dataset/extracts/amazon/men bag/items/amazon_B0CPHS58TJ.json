                "reviewText": "I don't review every product I purchase on Amazon or anywhere else, but I am very impressed with the Inateck sling bag for a variety of reasons. First, the bag is very well made - the outer fabric is truly water resistant while also being lightweight and strong. There are many thoughtful touches added to the bag that did not have to be included, such as ample dividers and sub-pockets in both the main pocket, the rear pocket, and the front pocket. There is a key lanyard attached to the front pocket that ends in a metal key hook. There is a padded electronics pocket in the main pocket that is large enough to hold my Kindle Oasis, as well as a Paperwhite. The main pocket contains several sub-dividers, including a large zippered pocket. The main pocket also includes several elastic bands into which small items may be secured. The rear pocket includes several credit card/business card slots. In all, Inateck did not skimp on including helpful details they could have omitted to save the company money in producing each bag.The strap on this bag is also unique at its price point - it contains a cam-operated buckle that allows you to quickly and easily adjust the length of the strap, unlike other sling bags that require more complex manipulation of buckles and straps to accomplish the same task. The strap and buckles are of excellent quality, also. The zippers on the bag are YKK zippers and are very smooth and easy to operate. The contrasting-color zipper pulls are a nice touch. And I appreciate the choice not to include magnetized parts in the buckles, unlike many other bags of a similar type. Those of us who need to carry magnetized key cards have to avoid bags with magnetized parts.This sling bag is simply a great value at its price point that incorporates good quality materials, excellent construction, and a thoughtful design with unique touches that I didn't find on any similarly-priced bag, or even on bags costing a lot more than this one. It was an outstanding value for me to be able to buy it at an excellent discount with the coupon offered by Inateck. I also give Inateck a lot of credit for another thoughtful addition to the purchase that I did not expect: the product came in box made for the bag by Inateck, and with a plastic wrapper around the bag to further protect the bag from damage before delivery to me. The product box is very unusual for a product sold on Amazon, and a good indication that Inateck values its customers. I highly recommend this bag, and I thank Inateck for providing a wonderful product at an affordable price.",

                "reviewText": "I like this sling over other slings because it has a cam-lock adjustment for the strap making actually wearing and using it everyday easy. The umbrella/water bottle pocket is a little small for an umbrella but works great for slim water bottles. I wish the zips were more water resistant but outside of that the build quality is pretty good. If they made a Steamdeck-sized version of this bag I'd buy it in a heartbeat.",

                "reviewText": "I really really love this bag. I owned many sling bag but I got to say this is my new favorite sling bag of them all now and I cannot leave the house without it.Pros:- It came very very well packaged, in a fancy-looking box with the company logo all over. I have bought lots of sling bags, even from a popular sling bag-making company, but only this one comes nicely packaged like that. The first impression won me immediately. I thought it's just knock off product from a Chinese company but turn out I was wrong. The high quality of the bag makes me even go back to Amazon to look up the brand. Turning out it is a legit company, founded in Germany and has a branch in Ontario, CA.- The bag design is very stylish and uses YKK zippers, which are super durable.- Very roomy. The main pocket has many small pockets and is divided nicely with padding and mesh elastic straps. I could easily fit a lot of my EDC in there, and when I need a particular item, I would be able to know where it is and get it quicker.- It has one medium-sized zippered pocket in the front for storing quick-access items. Inside, it also has a webbing key hook.- On the back, it has another concealed zippered pocket for important items like a wallet, phone, or passport. Inside, it also has cut-out slots for storing up to 3 credit cards or IDs.- The bag uses a Duraflex quick-release buckle, which is famous for making great buckles. The shoulder strap length is adjustable and has a locking mechanism to prevent the strap from slipping.- There's an extra space between the front and rear pocket where I keep my water bottle. The bag did get a little bit bulkier with the bottle stuffed inside but wearing it doesn't make me feel uncomfortable since the shoulder strap is very soft and decent size.Cons: none. However, just one thing that I don't really like about the glossy material on the front of the bag. It's water-resistant for sure, which is great, but I don't think that smooth surface is scratch-resistant. But who knows, I might be wrong again. I will post an update if any damage happens after using it for a while.Overall, this is a super good sling bag at an amazing price and can serve any purpose or carry anything you would ever need daily. I would strongly recommend it to everybody. Don't spend hundreds of dollars on a brand-name bag, buy this instead and you won't ever need any other bags anymore.",
