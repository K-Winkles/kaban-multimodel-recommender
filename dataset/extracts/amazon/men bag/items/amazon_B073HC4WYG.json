She now uses the bag at least once a week. !Initially, because the material the bag is composed of is pretty thin, I was concerned about it's durability. Thankfully it has remained fully intact, and those fears were unfounded. The only caveat, is that the long shoulder strap sometimes gets in the way because it isn't removable or adjustable. But everything considered, it's an affordable and nice looking bag, and has proven to be quite useful.",
