My only major issue was when I was alway I wore it for a long period of time and it kept giving me that rug burn feel. It also kept hitting my butt (I am 5 ft so it could just be me. But the more weight and longer time carrying it just gave me such a burning feeling on my neck constantly. I wouldn\u2019t suggest it for trips where you need this on for a long time but it great with short daily life.",
