The strap is weird not manufactured well which is surprising given the overall quality of the bag. It's a 3 point strap system to the bag which means when it's used as pictured one of the hooks is free and flapping or bunched up in one corner and clicked in. Probably won't use it like I wanted to because I'm afraid the clips will break but it's good enough to take on short road trips for my son.",
