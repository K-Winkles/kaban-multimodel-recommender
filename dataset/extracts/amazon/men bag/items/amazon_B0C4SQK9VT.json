The leather accents aren't real leather, but very closely mimic it. The construction is not shoddy anywhere that I can see. I think it's a darn good value for the price and I'm very happy I got it. It looks nice too.I initially thought the expansion zippers were a bit gimmicky,and didn't A) expect to use them, or B) expect them to be very useful,but, as one might guess, I did wind up with more stuff to take back than I'd arrived with,so I went ahead and unzipped both of the expansion joints, just to see what it would get me.Well, I was surprised at the difference it made, and it was just adequate to accommodate my increased space needs.",

When all said & done, the bag was stuffed to the gills..beyond what I thought possible., it had to be at least 40lbs of crap...I figured somewhere along the way the strap would give out..but it held., the straps dug into my shoulders the whole way., no matter what I did., but other than that...absolutely no complaints., I even had to send it thru to luggage when I got to the jet bridge., only bcuz I had it stuffed to the max..but on the return, it fit in overhead and under seat w/ no problems...good looking & manly looking to..With the 2 end zips opened, you can get way more stuffed into it than you think. Great bag for the price point.!",
