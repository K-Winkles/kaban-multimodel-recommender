I am not a yoga person, but this bag can be used for many things. I like the way the bottom can unzip and expand the depth of the bag. I am planning on purchasing another to use as a diaper bag for my new great granddaughter. I will be using my bag for traveling, as a computer case, a beach bag, as a craft bag, and even to carry teaching supplies. I am also going to purchasing a few more to send with my grandchildren as they return to college. Thanks, Karen",

                "reviewText": "I would love this bag if the zippers were heavier. This bag is everything I need as a yoga teacher- expandable, has lots of pockets, inside and out, flexible, holds large yoga mat and all of my yoga supplies.But - as I loaded it up with everything - Yes it did fit and I could carry it just fine, the zipper was really hard to get closed and It is pretty flimsy. I could tell that it would not last. I returned it without using it : (I would pay $20 - $30 more for this design bag with heavy duty seams and zippers.",

It holds everything! My weights, bands, spin shoes, yoga mat, and towel. It has a pocket for my phone, chapstick, keys, and spin shoes tool. This bag will hold it all. It's strong enough for my weights (20lbs so far). Love it!",
