                "reviewText": "I bought 2 of these backpacks. The 1st one was a while back mainly for work travel, and the 2nd just a few days ago because of the incredible price! The zippers are sturdy and do not get caught up in the material (the material is not cheapy) when opening, and closing. The USB charger connector (on the outside) is shrouded, and facing down so debris, or moisture doesn't get into it. Quite a few zippered pockets inside for whatever you need to carry. The shoulder straps are very comfortable, durable, and not overly padded (just right). Also the stretchy luggage slip-on on the back is definitely well done, it's a snug fit, not lose at all. That's a plus when hustling to your next flight. Depending on its contents it sits upright on its own. It's rare that I brag about something from Amazon, but this would be one of them. I should buy a few more for gifts. I'm sure this will last a long time, I take care of my stuff, but if you're rough, and tough then you'll be satisfied, and happy with this purchase. (Maybe not for survivalists, but I would definitely like to know if anyone else has given this a REAL test of use, abuse, hard core situations).",

When it\u2019s not packed too much it\u2019s nice and flat and doesn\u2019t stick out too much.

This backpack has so many features that you could use for anything you need to do. It\u2019s a laptop backpack/case but it can do so much more for you. There are two external drink holders. A usb hub to hook up to a brick that lets you charge your phone, laptop, or anything else that needs to be charged. The compartments are numerous and well thought out by the engineers who designed this bag. Padded shoulder straps, an inaccessible pocket to prevent thievery while wearing, and multiple d-ring-like attachments to hang stuff from will make your life easier and more organized. There is also a strap across the back that you can place over your luggage extendable arms so you don\u2019t need to carry it on your back. This backpack is top quality at a much cheaper price than a lot of the \u201cregular\u201dbackpacks out there.",

                "reviewText": "The bag came with a little lock, but it was easily ripped from the zipper, so it was meh. However, after using this for years, I've liked that the bag can handle some light rain, so I'm not too worried about leaving my laptop or other electronics from work. The bag can handle a lot of items, which I like and there is a pocket for all the little knick-knacks I can use like my pen/pencils, little notebook, hair ties, chewing gums, etc. There is some room so that I can put a little package breakfast/lunch box too.The bag I received did not have a little zipped bag in the back of the bag, so I don't have any opinion on this feature. This bag has survived several issues when my water bottle has tilted and water has leaked out, but I have found that in the last year, there has been a permanent water stain mark in the front. The external USB port was gimmicky and only lasted a little over a year before it stopped working. I was also worried as there is no cover for it on the out so dust and water could have damaged it.Overall this bag has managed to survive daily wear and tear and occasional abuse from me for years, so was worth the money. A solid backpack choice.",

I wanted to wait until I could give an honest review after testing it out rather than taking it out of the package. It\u2019s seriously the best backpack I\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s perfectly padded for your electronics, yet still light enough by itself to be practical. I carry extremely heavy stuff for school and have one giant textbook and this backpack fits it with ease. The extra pockets make it super easy and convenient to organize without compromising style and looks.The material is very thick and sturdy, as well as the stitching. The zippers have held up very well as well. It\u2019s an added bonus that it\u2019s not ridiculously expensive either. I genuinely don\u2019t have anything bad to say about this bag. It gets a 10/10 from me!",

Like the gray color as a neutral bag. Definitely has a lot of space with its various pockets and fits almost everything I need for my day easily. Has a laptop compartment which is essential for students. So far it\u2019s held up which is great as it doesn\u2019t seem like I will need to replace it anytime soon.",
