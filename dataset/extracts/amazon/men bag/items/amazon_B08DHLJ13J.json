                "reviewText": "This bag has a pocket for everything! I can carry two 17 inch laptops in the back pocket for both of my job roles. There are two larger pockets in the center for separating folders and a couple of smaller ones for other items (mouse, post-its, etc.). The front has room at the bottom for lots (below the pens and other items demonstrated). I put my charger in the outer most front so that I'm always prepared. The best part is that it feels great on - when to capacity, I don't notice the weight. It's a good, strong material and sleek - there are many pockets, but it doesn't look busy. I consider it my mobile office and love it!",

                "reviewText": "The bag came exactly as described. I love the many different compartments and pockets that it had, it can help you carry lots of different things in it without having to worry. The only downside for me was the fabric material. I was really hoping for something with premium quality fabric but that was not the case, it felt a little cheap to me unfortunately and it was a little rough on the skin to carry even with hands. That was something that I cannot judge by pictures until I had to try it first-hand. Also, I noticed that the back side of the bag was not well-tailored, there were some spaces through the bag and I was seriously worried that it won't last for too long or maybe would not handle heavy and large-sized items.On the other hand, the bag is a really good option for many college/school student and business-oriented people if you are looking for something that is not expensive and would just do the job for you.I later happened to go for a little more expensive option that had really good quality material and I personally would not regret that, I feel like this is an investment towards my future to have a secure bag that I will know to last for a good while.",

So indicates that likely isn\u2019t the best quality. Also the zippers of that compartment (middle and second largest) have frequently gotten a bit stuck in one direction but I worked around it just zipping the other direction (but it was an indication of lesser quality of a zipper).",
