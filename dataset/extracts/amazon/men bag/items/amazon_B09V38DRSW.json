I am so glad I went with my gut on the color, it\u2019s somewhere between a rust and burnt sienna, very pretty but neutral enough go with most any outfit. It\u2019s the perfect size, larger than the Fanny-pack-sling bag but smaller/lighter weight than the market tote bags I\u2019m so drawn to. It holds my phone, wallet, keys, sunglasses and a few other extras just fine. I may have to come back for another color just to have options, because I know I\u2019ll be using this bag for a long time!",

It doesn\u2019t fit well when worn over the shoulder. It shares one cheaply made strap not the normal 2 that most have. This causes the bag to bunch up into a c shape. It\u2019s awful. The seller was great but the product was very disappointing. I returned it immediately. Not sure how people liked this.",
