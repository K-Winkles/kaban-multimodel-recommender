It has 4 tens pads that need to stick on us in various places and the programs last 30 min to 1 1/2 hours, so we needed something to hold the FSM machine while we move around. We put the FSM inside this bag and the cords fit right in there with it so they aren\u2019t catching on things and we aren\u2019t dropping our FSM machine since it is zipped into the bag. The crossbody strap is very comfortable. Fits both my husband and myself. There is also a zippered pocket in the front that we can drop our cell phone in! Great find!!",

Second, it fits nice and snug to the body, with plenty of room for size adjustment. Even when moving around, the bag doesn\u2019t need to be readjusted. It stays right where you put it. I\u2019m not sure what I was expecting, but this tiny bag actually fits quite a bit! I bought a tiny wallet, but it fits a full size wallet easily. Inside, I was able to fit a full size wallet, 2 pairs of glasses and a pair of earbuds with a little extra room. The outside pocket can also fit a pair of sunglasses, though it made the bag somewhat bulky. Overall, this bag is a fantastic price and a perfect little travel companion!",

It\u2019s big enough for carrying my essential gear, but not too big to be cumbersome. I recommend it for every day use.",
