                "reviewText": "This is a pretty awesome messenger bag for the money!The Pros in my opinion:This bag has lots of space. You can virtually fit all your daily essentials in this bag, and more; since it\u2019s not limited to strictly being just a laptop bag. It also has lots of pockets. So if cargo capacity is what you\u2019re after, you won\u2019t be disappointed.The shoulder strap is soft, and approximately 2 inches wide, making the bag comfortable to carry. The strap is also sewn to the bag, giving it a seamless look, and the strap\u2019s length adjusts easily.The canvas the entire bag is made of has some heft to it, and is solidly constructed. It doesn\u2019t feel flimsy, and should be able to keep up with you.The bag\u2019s hardware is pretty solid. The zippers, magnetic closures, buckles, etc. looks like they could hold up well.It\u2019s classic, simple, and versatile style, coupled with its vintage vibe looks really cool. With a good color selection, you shouldn\u2019t have a problem looking for one that tailors to your own personal style.The Cons in my opinion:There is no top handle. So if you ever get tired of carrying the bag on your shoulder, you have to carry it by its strap.Overall, for the price it\u2019s going for, you get a lot for what you pay for. No bells, no whistles. Just a great solid bag to carry what you need, to help get you through your day, ready to go when you are.",

Right out of the bag It felt properly broken in, which was nice. It is an easy way to carry my laptop, charger, mouse, paperwork and water bottle around. And with such a classic look and feel. While it does have a laptop sleeve, it is not very padded. I put in an additional sleeve so I can bang it around a little in a coffee shop and not worry.",

It didn\u2019t seem right or appropriate to enter into the music profession with a bulky, old backpack.This bag comfortably fits everything I usually need to function as a professional vocalist. My iPad, Bible, headphones, AUX cord, chargers, flashlight, and a pen fit with ample room and room to even improve on space.It\u2019s a great stylish option if you want to switch to streamlining your EDC or minimize your load with potential to carry more.Needs may vary, but if you\u2019re a professional musician as well as a minimalist, I would say this bag will give a good sense of security.",

I use it on day hikes and to carry my lunch and other stuff to work. And when traveling it carries various necessities.I like the magnetic snap to the flaps, though I rarely close it.It has lots of great pockets! It makes things nicely accessible.",

                "reviewText": "My first day out with the bag was to a friend's for a crafty day. I stopped by the yarn store on my way down. I fit my mini-laptop, my tablet, my project notebook, and six skeins of yarn, plus various pens, knitting needles, and crochet hooks. And I still had room. Bonus: I could reach everything!It has zipper pockets on the back and the outside of the flap. A second zipper section under the flap with partitions for pens and things. Plus pockets. I stuck my new beads and stitch markers there. The interior has a padded pocket for laptops, and a very spacious main space. That main space was where the six skeins of yarn went. If I were to stay at home, I could see it as a yarn holder for a multicolor project.Nice bonus: all the zippers are covered, which means they're protected from the elements as well as wear and tear. Excellent value for the price.",
