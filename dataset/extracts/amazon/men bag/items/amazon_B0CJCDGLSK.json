The material for the bag feels a lot thicker and somewhat water resistant (I wouldn\u2019t swim with it, but it\u2019s gunna survive a walk in a light rain).The best part is that there are so many pockets AND two waterbottle pouches! Gone are the days where pens mix with the notebooks mix with the snacks mix with the phone chargers in single pocket draw string bags.I love this bag and I am gunna gift them to everyone for their birthdays this year!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this because I wanted a smaller gym bag but also still have a shoe compartment to keep dirt off my clothes. This is described to have a shoe compartment but a pair of shoes would never fit in this bag unless you use the large compartment but then you have no where to put your clothes. Completely disappointed with this purchase and the inaccurate description.",

                "reviewText": "Not only is this bag good for carrying around gym essentials, it\u2019s also great for camping trips, sporting events, hiking, pretty much anywhere you go and need a bag to take with you. I love how there\u2019s a separate zippered compartment for shoes. I\u2019ve seen these types of bags in stores but there\u2019s no compartment for shoes like this one has. Also I like the reflective stripe on the back, perfect if you\u2019re riding your bike, walking, or hiking and it\u2019s getting dark outside.",

Was able to carry my weight belt, towel in the big pouch and my earbuds, wallet, keys and phone in the smaller zipper front pocket. Has to 2 side pouches to carry water bottles. The straps can be adjusted to carry like a backpack. Good choice.",
