                "reviewText": "I like that this duffel bag folds up into a compact pouch when not in use, so it's easy to store. I also like the compartmentalization of the bag, especially the separate shoe area. Transporting my gym shoes after a workout has always been an issue (I usually stick them into a plastic grocery bag), so I like that this has a dedicated spot for my shoes away from all of my other items. I wear a women's size 8 and my tennis shoes fit, but there isn't a ton of extra room. I'm not sure how the shoes of someone with much larger feet would fit. The bag does not have any firm support in its bottom area which allows it to fold up so compactly, but it also doesn't provide any support for anything heavy. I think this duffel bag is best suited for clothes, water bottles, a lightweight microfiber towel, etc and I don't think I would try to use it for any heavy workout equipment. Overall, it works for me and I like it.Gym Bag for Men Women, Foldable Travel Duffel Bags with Shoe Compartment & Wet Pocket, Lightweight Weekender Overnight Duffle Bag, Water Resistant Workout Sports Bag, Black",

The zippers all move smoothly and except for the shoe pocket, the zippers don't get caught on the fabric. The shoe pocket does fit my running shoes and dirty gym clothes at the same time. The straps are placed perfectly so the bag doesn't sag. I've folded it up and brought it on trips so that I have a gym bag on vacation and everything folds into the shoe pocket without any effort. So far no issues and it's a great looking bag with everything I need.",
