                "reviewText": "Needed an over the shoulder bag to act as a lightweight briefcase for transporting work items (mostly folders with occasional books), but didn't want a full backpack. This bag is working very well. It's big enough for folders and textbooks (even my laptop) with room to spare. The interior pockets are great for pens, whiteboard markers, a snack bar, etc. and the outside zipper pocket is a bonus. I don't use the shoe compartments. The mesh pouches on the side too small for a large water bottle, but hold an umbrella perfectly. I usually carry the bag over one shoulder but, if carrying books, I sometimes use both straps like a backpack. Even though the straps aren't padded, they are reasonably comfortable. Would definitely be fine if carrying lighter weight items. The drawstring closure is fairly tight given the width of the straps. There is also a loop for hanging. The entire bag is lined. The fabric seems sturdy and shows no sign of wear after 8 weeks of daily use. It states that it is water resistant, but I gave it an extra spray of waterproofing just to be safe. Have carried it in light rain and everything has stayed dry. Overall, it's a much better bag than I expected and suits my needs well. It would be good for travel as a carry on or day pack. And no, I did not receive any form of compensation for this review. It's just a good bag.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I'm in love with this backpack. I love the fact that it doent look bulky when you tie it close. Most backpacks look bulky even when the backpack is empty. I also like the fact that the backpack sits up. It doesn't fall over. The material is like a strong ski jacket. Very thick and strong. The bag is very flexible. Meaning you can fit a lot of stuff in the bag. Most backpacks have a tighter structure to the bag. So it's limited to how much stuff you can put in the bag. If you get a chance to purchase it, you'll see what I mean. This is the best backpack I've ever owned. I realized that in the first 5mins. Especially after I opened the bag and saw how wide and deep the bag is. You really cant tell that the bag opens up that wide by looking at it on the outside. It has so much room and is very flexible. It looks like it does well in the rain as well. I'm quite sure it's rain proof. 20$ is a steal for this bag. This bag is more like a 50$-60$ quality backpack for sure. I'm so happy with this backpack . I mite get a few other ones in different color. I highly highly recommend buying this backpack in any color to your likingThank you again AMAZON",

The large pocket is lined in plastic like it's water resistant, but the side pocket is not. I kinda wish it was opposite, as he puts his books in the big pocket and his water bottle in the side pocket. The bag itself is way bigger than I thought it would be, and I like that the straps are wide so they don't cut into the shoulders. I'd buy it again!",

I poured some water on it to test the water resistance and the inside stayed nice and dry. The straps are much more comfortable than the cheaper bags with the rope ties and it has more zippered pockets than I expected - one outside on the front and another small zippered pouch inside as well. I plan to use this bag for trips to theme parks and I think it's going to be perfect. I'd definitely recommend this bag to anyone looking for a sturdier, more protective bag for things like sweatshirts, towels, etc.",
