The strap to hang it over my shoulder keeps sliding and I have to adjust it constantly, otherwise it hurts my neck.

                "reviewText": "I ordered this crossbody backpack to use on a trip to Universal Studios, Hollywood. I didn't want to take my purse or a large backpack. I compared other styles and liked the look and size of this one over the others. Also compared reviews before buying.Pros:-waterproof and easy to clean/wipe off any smudges from wearing lotion-plenty of pockets and space to hold wallet, keys, hand sanitizer, etc.-lightweight (when it has barely anything in it)Cons:- the more stuff you add to it weighs it down and the adjustable strap no longer stays in place where it was once adjusted to.- the smallest zipper pouch in the middle center, I ultimately used it to hold my phone. At first it was easy to slide in and out, but it is not deep enough, and it stuck out like 3 inches. After a week of use the lining of that pocket has ripped.- the little port looking thing on the side you can supposedly put a charging cable through, is totally useless. I tried to put my own cable through and it was almost impossible. I somehow managed to get the head of a lightning cable through but it was tough and ultimately I chose not to use it at all.-The thicker strap that has a cushion was too thick in my opinion, wish it was as thin as the adjustable part of the strap.-The strap did dig into my neck and rubbed when I had a lot of stuff in the backpack, I got a bit of a rash and had to constantly adjust to keep it from getting worse.Overall it worked for what I needed it for. Hope this helps those interested in getting one.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted something small enough to fit under my jacket and doesn't count as a 'carry-on bag' but roomy enough to hold my essentials (headphones, passport, charger & cables). This one checks all my boxes and looks great, too. It is made from a soft material (almost feels like suede) but has rugged straps and big zippered pockets. Just 2 complaints: the adjustable metal buckle easily twists and causes the strap to bunch up and cause undue friction; and the zippers do not glide easily so that will also cause undue wear over time. I can probably remedy both of these issues myself but i wish they were solved by the mfg.",

                "reviewText": "Garbage products like this make me wish Amazon would do a better job of managing product photos and descriptions, forcing sellers (especially from China who are really infamous for this) to prove they are providing accurate pictures of the items they sell. My stupid decision not to note the measurements given in the 3rd picture here. The first and main picture of this bag shows \"beats style\" headphones against the bag, and the bag is clearly 3-4 times the size of the headphones. Based on the high rating for this and that picture, I purchased this item, only to get it to realize it's basically a baby-sized pack that I cannot imagine how any real life-sized adult could even use.As you can see in my pictures, my headphones, a slightly larger pair of Senheissers would not even remotely fit into this bag, so, no way the headphones pictured on the item could fit, and if you somehow got them to fit, you'd have room for literally nothing else in this bag. This is much too small for a 10\" kindle fire tablet. It's nearly too small for the kindle paperwhite if you want to add anything else to the bag.The strap is terrible...to resize it, you move the strap along a clip, but the metal clip is so cheap and poorly made that it will never stay in place no matter what you do. The material is very different than what the pictures make it look to be as well. The black color looks to be a weird leather-like material, but the blue, which is the one I got, does not look like that odd material. Sadly, it is. I am not sure what the material is, but it does not have a nice feel to it, and it's not something I've ever seen in any sort of backpack.You can tell this is a poorly made, mass-produced Chinese product. You can tell from the product information that whoever wrote the copy is not a native English-speaker, not inherently an issue, but I am sick of Amazon being littered with Chinese-based companies that almost always sell really cheaply made products and are infamous for editing their photos in such a way to dishonestly sell their products. The headphones in the main image are, in real life, a good 3 to 4 times the size of the ones edited into the picture. Now, I have to drive over to whole foods to return this and find a new product that is sized for an actual human adult, and try to find one that doesn't have dishonestly edited photos in their listing, and hopefully avoid a Chinese firm selling it, as I try my best to avoid these sellers- too much experience has told me, very few of them can be trusted to accurately depict their products, and this experience has strengthened that notion.",

Gli altri due scomparti sono di piccole dimensioni ma ugualmente funzionali. Altro ed ultimo piccolo scomparto, \u00e8 chiudibile tramite un moschettone esterno rapido, che potrebbe anche essere utilizzato per il trasporto di un piccolo indumento (maglia, sciarpa,berretto, ecc\u2026).La valutazione globale risulta a mio parere soddisfacente, come pure il rapporto qualit\u00e0/prezzo; ne consiglio pertanto l\u2019acquisto, ribadendo per\u00f2 che trattasi di oggetto di dimensioni contenute.Ho avuto modo di recensire questo prodotto con totale imparzialit\u00e0 grazie al programma Amazon Vine del quale faccio parte.",

                "reviewText": "This sling bag has a very smooth, rubber feel to it, and it does smell of plastic as soon as you take it out of the packaging, which is a simple translucent bag. The smell is very similar to children\u2019s swimming armbands and is quite strong. It doesn\u2019t take too long for the smell to go away, or at least be hardly noticeable so that\u2019s a good thing. The shoulder bag is quite small so is ideal for carrying smaller items, especially items that you don\u2019t want to get wet. It is made from faux leather and feels extremely strong with good stitching. The shoulder strap is adjustable and has a strong, adjustable belt with buckle. There are plenty of compartments on this bag as the main compartment is held closed with a zip and inside there is a little pocket at the back. On the front of the bag is a slightly horizontal zip with a small compartment. The front pouch is also held closed with a zip and has a silver emblem on the front which looks a little out of place as there is no name on it, just a blank emblem so maybe you could engrave the owners name on it yourself. There is a USB extension in the bag which allows you to install it into the USB hole in the side and have a power bank inside (not included) so you can charge your devices which use a USB-A connection. Very handy to have and it keeps your power bank dry if you decide to use one. There is also a hole in the side which allows you to feed your headphones through and keep your phone/mp3 player in your bag, nice and dry, and listen to your music. A very handy sling bag if you don\u2019t need to carry a lot of things with the added bonus of being splash proof\u2026",

                "reviewText": "This is what I'd describe as an essentials and gadget bag. Whether for women who don't want a handbag or men who have too much stuff to pack into their pockets, this is an excellent choice.The bag has many pockets, which allows you to organise your belongings. You have a larger middle section that will take a small to medium sized tablet or even couple of books and you have various smaller pockets for anything from phones to wallets to keys to power banks to snacks and so on. There's even a quick access section that isn't zipped that you can place a mac or snack bars, for example.The bag is pretty sleek looking. I picked up the blue version and I think it looks great for either a guy or girl. The waterproofing of the bag gives it a nice almost shiny quality whilst remaining pretty subtle. The silver zips are almost chrome-like in appearance and the jet black zippers and straps complement everything well.You get some nifty features on this bag such as a hole for your headphones (although I imagine most people are using Bluetooth these days), a USB port that you can connect a powerbank to (so it's possible to carry your phone and plug it into the port on the outside of the bag), and a security buckle to make it harder for pickpockets to access the middle section of the bag.Overall, this is a really cool little bag and I'll be getting a lot of use from it! :)",

A livello di capienza la trovo sulla media, quindi ha rispettato le aspettative.Come scritto possiede una presa USB laterale per darci la possibilit\u00e0 di ricaricare il cellulare o altri dispositivi USB che abbiano una porta Type A (per far ci\u00f2 \u00e8 necessaria una Power Bank connessa all'interno della tracolla e non inclusa) e, poco pi\u00f9 sopra, \u00e8 presente anche un foro con anello in alluminio per il passaggio del cavo delle cuffie... cos\u00ec da poter ascoltare musica, camminando.Per quanto riguarda l'ultimo punto... l'impermeabilit\u00e0... come accennato prima qui si parla di idrorepellenza ma bisogna sempre fare un po' attenzione alla tasca senza chiusura zip che potrebbe essere soggetta ad infiltrazioni, in caso di pioggia di normale intensit\u00e0.In generale la trovo una buona tracolla, con uno spallaccio sottile ma confortevole, un design curato e buoni materiali... il costo lo trovo congruo intorno ai 20\u20acQuindi, per tutto ci\u00f2 scritto (basandomi sull'articolo arrivato), la mia personale valutazione \u00e8 5 stelle su 5.\ud83d\udd8a\ufe0f Ps: In caso di novit\u00e0 effettuer\u00f2 un aggiornamento.Ti saluto con la speranza d'aver risposto alle tue domande, dubbi o semplicemente alle tue curiosit\u00e0... grazie per aver letto le mie parole e spero che questa mia recensione ti sia stata utile...Alla prossima!",
