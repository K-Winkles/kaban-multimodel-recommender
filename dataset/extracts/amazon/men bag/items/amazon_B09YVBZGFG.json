                "reviewText": "I got this bag to replace another cross body bag, and I'm super happy. It has more room than you'd expect, plus there are lots of pockets to keep your things organized. I can keep my phone, medication, inhaler, a compact, chapstick, a multitool, doggie bags, and keys in here and still have extra room. There is a small zippered pocket in the front where you can keep cards and/or cash. It's also versatile. I take this on walks or hikes, out fishing, to the store and recently to the theater. The soft, water resistant material can be cleaned with a damp cloth, and all the stitching and zippers are well made. You can where it over your sholder as well, or put it in a larger bag. My one issue is that, while you can shorten the strap, it tends to get loose pretty quickly. Otherwise, this is a nice, solid bag for many uses.",

                "reviewText": "Got this specifically for a Disneyland trip where I didn't want a large back pack, and also was wearing shorts with pockets that weren't very secure.PROs: I was always certain of where things were, right on my chest. It had enough room for my phone, kids epipen, spare phone chargers, and some other small things. With the strap around my neck/back there was very little chance anyone was going to get this away from me without a fight, so for security reason, I liked it alot.CONs: It wouldn't stay adjusted at all. Always slipping to the longest possible strap set up. It rubbed into my neck, so I was constantly trying to wrap my shirt around the strap to stop it from chaffing on my skin. It constantly slipped down from where it shows it would sit, and where you would want it to sit. I want to say I was shocked, but really, gravity just work, it will pull that thing down unless you are holding it in place.",
