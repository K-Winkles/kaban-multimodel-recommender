It is thin but VERY nice quality, and does have substance to it unlike other cheap string backpacks. It does not take up too much space, but does have great capacity to be able to hold a lot. This was perfect for Disney in Orlando. Held a lot without being a burden to carry! Also doesn't look bulky in pictures which I appreciated. The pockets are super nice to compartmentalize (wet vs dry) and plenty of space on the sides to slide in water bottles/drinks. Loved it!!",

Bags get builky in a closet quickly. This one won't. It folds flat as a thin book. Love that. Second, it expands to hold a lot of stuff. Like, a lot. It was perfect for a tri-weather day hike I took in the New England woods and easily carried my food, water and extra clothing as the day warmed, then cooled again. There are two mesh pockets on the outer sides for water bottles or trash, and the bottom compartment is great for muddy shoes. It would also be ideal for a soccer ball, so the bag is really versatile. I'd recommend this to anyone who has to carry anything ever. Particularly if they are kid things. Or outdoor things. The drawstring closure makes this easy to use, and dependable as well.",
