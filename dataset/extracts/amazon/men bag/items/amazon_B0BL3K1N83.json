It has a hidden battery charger port for my phone, a rfid zip pocket that holds small card wallet. Stash pocket for cash. Enough space for what I truly need. The fabric is perfect for stenciling or painting to make it your own. I plan on buying another because they come in so many colors and the price is good.",

I hike a lot although i don\u2019t hike for very long so this size bag is exactly what i needed\u2026 I have a 17 oz HyrdoFlow water bottle that fits perfectly in the side holders (have not had a problem with it falling out) but if you need more water I\u2019m sure a water bladder would fit perfectly inside the pack! it\u2019s perfect for traveling, and has lots of pockets inside and the zippers are sturdy! would recommend if this is the kind of bag your looking for:)",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this bag after my last hiking pack finally bit the dust. Right away I was impressed with the material and what looks to be decent build quality. This bag is larger than my previous one, maybe 1.5 times the capacity, and I love all of the separate pouches and pockets for organizing things.For reference, I am 5' 7\", around 115lbs but I have narrow shoulders and not much padding on them. I also have chronic upper back pain and overactive upper traps (sigh). So far I've taken this pack on two hikes so far and both times my back started hurting within the first half mile. I've tried rebalancing my supplies - not that I have much to begin with, and nothing that I have in it weighs more than a few ounces with the exception of a water bottle - but it's still painful.On my last hike, I ended up taking everything out of all of the pockets and piling it all into the bottom of the main compartment and then tucking my water bottle into my jacket pocket in order to make it through the rest of the hike.My last pack had a large pouch on the front of the strap for a cell phone, and somehow having a phone there was enough to balance the weight such that the pack wasn't constantly being pulled backward. This pack doesn't have that pouch, but I found that removing my prescription glasses case and clipping it onto the mole strap on the front helped provide that balance. (I thought about taking my glasses out and putting some rocks into it, too, lol.) And I could literally reach up and pull on it when the pack started to slide back and down too much again.Lastly, the adjustable strap part of the shoulder strap doesn't stay in place unless you wedge the loop up under the slider clip thingy, or tie the excess strap in a knot just beneath it.",

Also works well for day trips when we are touristing without being as big and bulky as a regular back pack. The one complaint I have is I'm a bigger person and wish the strap was a few inches longer.",
