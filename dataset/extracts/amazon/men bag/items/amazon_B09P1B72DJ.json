When he opened this one on Christmas, the Lululemon bag got thrown in the back of the closet. Lol. He likes this one SO much better. The quality is top notch. The fabric is high quality, and there is a lot of attention to detail, in the bag design. This is the perfect travel bag for a guy. It\u2019s rugged/manly and classy/stylish at the same time. He even got a compliment on it, when he was putting it up in the overhead bin on the plane. If you need a travel bag, this is the one. Sorry Lulu.",

Feels like a bag that will last for some time.I knocked it down a star for the color. I ordered gray, which it is, but it has a purple hue to it. After looking at it for a bit, I knew this would bug me. I\u2019m going to get a different color I think. This isn\u2019t a big deal for some, but it was enough for me to not keep it.Overall, it\u2019s a great weekend or travel bag. The design is well thought out, not too many pockets, nice leather handles and straps. Has a nice weathered look too. Good value. Recommend.",
