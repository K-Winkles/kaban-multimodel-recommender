They have plenty of space to fit a pair of shoes each, including that of a person who wears size 12 (could easily go even larger I am sure). While spacious enough, it easily fits into the thin lockers at Planet Fitness. I got the green and love the look.",

I've been using it for almost 4 months and it is holding up quite well, considering it gets used and thrown around pretty good. There are lots of compartments. I use the main compartment to hold multiple paddles, towels and a change of shirt, water bottle and other miscellaneous equipment (knee braces, strapping, etc). One of the side compartments holds half a dozen pickle balls easily. There are small inner compartments for your personals, keys, phone, etc. All this with room to spare.I love the colorway of this bag. The grey cloud-like base layer with the lime green accents looks fantastic.There are cheaper options out there, but I'm happy with my selection. Strong recommend.",

                "reviewText": "My daughter needed a gym bag to transport her Taekwondo sparring gear and fell in love with the appearance of the Adidas Defender Medium duffel. The Adidas Defender bag is stylish and affordable, and from a purely cosmetic perspective the bag is nice. However, from a functional, utilitarian perspective, not so much. The Adidas bag is sufficient for my daughter's purpose, as her sparring gear is light-weight, and fortunately the chest-protector and head-gear acts as a rigid frame within the gym bag to help the bag to hold it's shape. Without the rigid nature of her protection gear - the bag would likely collapse and fold up in the middle (while slung using the shoulder straps), with even the lightest of loads. The canvas is very thin and the bottom support \"padding\" is equally thin and lacking. I'll give the bag 4 stars, as it was affordable and it does meet our specific need...but for any other purpose, I would've likely sent it back.",
