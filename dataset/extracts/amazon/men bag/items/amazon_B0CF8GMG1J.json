                "reviewText": "This is a nice set that is both black and white on each bag, both differ in shape and size a bit and one is more predominantly white and the other more so black. They also come with a greeting card for each bag. Again, one card is mostly black and other is white, but still using both colors.The bags and cards both say Happy Birthday on various sizes, fonts, and shapes. It keeps it interesting and unique. You can use them together as a set if you have multiple gifts and need both bags, and of course it will look great and incredibly put together since they can go hand in hand.You can also break them up and use them separately as well.I was able to use them for the same person but one card I put was just from me, and then the other card I wrote a note from his family and nephew.It was nice and this can be for any age and gender. Also great for any type of birthday occasion, such as casual or a dressier party. These would work great with either and anything in between.They also came with black and white tissue paper and it worked well and the bags, bottom of bags, and handles to the bags were all sturdy and durable. They are good quality and did not rip, tear, break or show any issues of wear at all. That was impressive.The cardstock is also made well as well as envelopes.The tissue paper is also nice.The only thing I did wish I had was another white and another black piece of tissue paper each. That would have helped a bit, but I still was able to get the gift bags looking good with no issues.Besides that these are great quality birthday bag, tissue paper and greeting card/ envelope sets and they are great for anyone.I'd definitely get them again.Honestly, the bags are still in such great condition I will probably save them and put them to use again at some point.Of course not the cards or tissue paper, but the bags can certainly be reused if you would like or have the opportunity to.",

I give these a five-star rating for their quality and convenience because they come with cards and tissue paper already. The set includes two elegantly designed gift bags, one in a sophisticated black and the other in a classic white, both accompanied by matching greeting cards and tissue paper. The size of 12.6\" x 10.25\" x 4.7\" makes these bags ideal for a variety of gifts, be it for men or women. The inclusion of greeting cards and tissue paper adds a thoughtful touch, simplifying the gift-wrapping process and saving time. The sturdy build of the bags ensures they can hold a range of items securely. Overall, these gift bags are not only practical but also add a touch of class to any present, making them perfect for birthdays or any special occasion.",

                "reviewText": "I'll admit it. I got this set of gift bags for my male cousin, because I didn't want to wrap his stuff (I got him an old time camera, like from the '50s, which would be a pain to put into wrapping paper). I don't know him that well, except that he loves cameras, and thought these masculine looking gift bags would help me succeed in the wrapping department. I love that there are 2 cards available too, like photo images of each other - one is white with black letters, the other black with white lettering, just like the bags themselves. And you get the matching tissue paper in black and white. 2 bags, 2 cards, and tissue paper. My gift wrapping needs are met! I may even use one set for my mother-in-law, which is also impossible to buy for because we have exactly opposite tastes in everything. These are nice neutral but complete sets for your gift wrap needs. Have someone who is hard to shop for? These are for you. Good size, so you can put in an old-time camera or a gift with some size. Not strong enough to hold cinder blocks, but very few people gift those. I'm going with the look where I put the black bag with the white card and white tissue paper, but you can do whatever feels artistically right for you and your giftee. I love these and find them ultra practical. Usually, I get pink stuff, but this is tremendous to have the option to just use neutral colors but with great designs. LOVE THEM. A+ for design and implementation. Excited to see what he thinks!",

                "reviewText": "This gift bag set includes 2 gift bags, 2 cards with envelopes and 2 sheets of tissue paper. The bags are described as large, but I consider them medium sized. They are made of sturdy, semi-gloss paper with a modern design that could be used for males or females of any age. The black handles are about 1/2-inch wide, made out of a material that feels like thin cotton shoelaces. The cards are generously sized and fit well in the included 5 x 7-inch white heavyweight envelopes. There is 1 sheet of white and 1 sheet of black tissue paper, each about 20 inches by 27.5 inches. I bought this set to use the black one for a man's 40th (Over the Hill) birthday gift. The small throw blanket I enclosed fits with a slight bulge. The contents of this kit came wrapped in plastic, but I was able to keep the white bag covered with most of the plastic until it can be used.This set is a good value. The price is not much more for 2 bags than for 1 very similar bag I saw.",
