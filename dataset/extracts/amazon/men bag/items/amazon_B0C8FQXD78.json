The front pocket barely holds my iPhone max, I probably won\u2019t put it there because it is hard to get out. If I could tighten the straps a bit more, I could have the option to put it around my waist like a large Fanny pack. Wearing over one shoulder on the side is ok, but you have to hold it. Wearing as a crossbody sling is really the best way, and that\u2019s the original intention obviously! It looks/functions like half a backpack. Great for day trips. Holds light jacket, wallet, keys, sunglasses, and flip flops! And a water bottle fits inside the pack.",
