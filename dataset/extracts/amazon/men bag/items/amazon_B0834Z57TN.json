                "reviewText": "First off, this is my first bag used for concealed carry that doesn't look like I'm obviously armed. It is small enough to appear to be a bag that only holds the basics, but it carries much more.The wallet holder is perfect for a standard single fold wallet. There is enough room to make removal and insertion easy. Mine shares space with a nitro pill bottle (at the bottom) without any space issues. The wallet holder velcro has worn with multiple daily use, but is usable.The main bag front flap easily holds my Springfield Armory 911 9mm inside of a pocket holster. I was shocked when I realized it can also hold a Springfield Hellcat Pro without a holster. (Yep, the full sized grip one) The .45 XD mod 2 with a 9 round pinky extension magazine fits snug. The velcro on this flap isn't made for a lot of use. The whole strip pulled partially off in less than six months and the grip/hold became weak. Despite it weakening, I considered the flap pocket advantageous for quick access.The middle section (zipper) is spacious. It also will hold the Hellcat, but I use it for spare ammo. Three hellcat pro mags and two 911 9mm mags still leaves room for more extra magazines or other items.The side pouches can hold a medium sized folding knife with a clip, or two pens and a kubaton keychain.I use the rear slot for my cellphone.The straps provided are fine. I personally use a padded shoulder strap of my own for additional comfort.The overall advantage of having a smaller and less obvious bag holding a respectable amount of backup ammo and a weapon outweighs the velcro issues. I just repurchased this item again to replace my worn out item.",
