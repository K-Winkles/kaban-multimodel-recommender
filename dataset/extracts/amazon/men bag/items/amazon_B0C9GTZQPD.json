I currently carry a tablet, mini-bluetooth keyboard, one flat box of essential oils, a bottle of massage oil, my office keys, an mp3 player, my cell phone and a small notebook. I still have room for more but this is enough to lighten the weight of my work bag because they aren't in it and all of these things are too big to fit in my pockets. :-)It is made of nylon like you might find in clothing. The zippers work fine (important), and it is roomier than you would expect by looking at it (also important). The only thing fancy about it is the neon colors it is available in. I have neon lime green because if I am ever looking for (because I have misplaced it or someone just snatched it), I want to be able to see it from a distance. :-)For my very modest needs, this is a great bag at a great price (in great colors!)",

It's very light weight, largely due to the light weight fabric which is a rip-stop weave, and the seams seem securely sewn, so it still seems to be very durable.When I fly I use this as my personal carry-on bag along with my carry-on backpack suitcase -- as a sling bag, I can carry this in front of me at the same time as the backpack, which keeps both of my hands free.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this as an alternative to carrying a backpack when traveling. Took it on its first trip this past weekend on a plane and for city touring. It was so inexpensive and when I received it, certainly better than the price I paid (<$10.00). Material seems to be some sort of ripstop and somewhat thin but sturdy. Back is padded but not breathable. Zippers work really well, and I like the two zip pulls so depending on where you wear it, zips are accessible. The three compartments work well and lets you organize some. The largest compartment held my 16 oz water bottle and the interior pocket easily swallowed my 8\" Fire with sleeve. The mesh bottle holders could hold my water bottle, but for purpose of using this on a plane, inside the main was better. Off the plane the mesh pockets sufficed. Strap can be switched from side to side, though somewhat thin in the padding. There is one elastic attachment loop by the adjust buckle which is fine and a fairly large grab handle on top that can be used for a carabiner also. This was the perfect bag to use on the plane in conjunction with my roller suitcase. Left a lot of space for my feet under the seat in front of me yet accessible.",

I don't carry it as a cross-body, but it feels nice on my shoulder and doesn't slip. I added cute pins to the front just to add character. I love this bag so much!!!!",
