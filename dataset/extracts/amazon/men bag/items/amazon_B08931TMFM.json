                "reviewText": "I love this bag. I was using a backpack before I got this and it was so much so I would pack it full. This helps me be more mindful of what I am taking to and from work. There has been a rain spell here since I got it and I have never had an issue with rain getting in, and considering I keep my laptop in it that is a huge relief. My favorite thing about this bag is actually the padding for the laptop, I did not have my coffee one morning and the bag slipped out of my hand and hit the ground hard. I was half expecting to find my laptop with something wrong with it, but I took it out and it was like new. No issues at all. That told me I picked the right bag. My only wish is there being an exterior pocket, or being slightly larger front pocket. I often do not wear my glasses into the office and have to put them in my bag until the computer screen wears my eyes down. I have to just set it on top of my notebooks and it does not work great all the time.",

I recently used this for my trip to Greece and I could wear it without an issue even in the hot weather.I like the color and it's a decent size. I can fit my 9.7 inch iPad Pro with a case in the middle. My Nintendo Switch OLED with case fits in the rear pocket. I put in two books, a notebook, my Anker Power Bank, a pen, ear buds, and my Power Beats Pro.I wouldn't put that much in but did it to show close to the max capacity. I couldn't get the battery charger part to work which is annoying. I took a star off for that and the fact that my iPad didn't fit in the rear pocket. Overall I would recommend it for EDC.",

                "reviewText": "-I got this sling bag because the bag I had been using for work was not quite big enough to hold my 8\" x 10\" day planner and the corners were getting pinched. This bag, on the other hand, has more than enough space for notebooks of that size or electronics such as tablets and laptops. (Just make sure you're getting the larger size shown in my pictures, as I saw several reviews saying that the smaller bag is not big enough to hold a laptop.)-The cord for the USB adapter tucks into a small hidden zipper on the inside of the bag when not in use. Possibly a very small portable charger could fit inside the compartment with it, but I haven't tested that. A larger portable charger can tuck into one of the flat inner pockets inside the main pocket of the bag.-The small pocket on the back (the part that is up against your body) is just big enough to hold a large glasses case like shown, or maybe a small umbrella.-One minor downside is that the water bottle holder is on the inside rather than the outside of the bag. It's also kind of small and my 24oz metal bottle doesn't fit. But a 16.9oz standard plastic bottle or a metal can should fit just fine. It is also more secure to have the drink pocket on the inside to avoid your drink falling out or being stolen.-Overall this is an excellent backpack to take to work, school, hiking, the gym, and anywhere else you may need a smaller bag. I don't usually leave long reviews like this but this backpack really impressed me.",

                "reviewText": "I love this sling back backpack. I bought it to replace the bag I used to carry my Ipad pro 12.9 which couldn't carry much more than the pad, a wallet and some gum...which also had the disadvantage of either requiring I use a hand to keep it on my shoulder, or putting it over on the opposite shoulder where it would dig into my muscles. This bag solves all these problems, and adds a bit more capacity so I can fit more \"essentials that aren't paper thin\" like curved sunglasses, thick key fobs, and backup batteries.I goes over the shoulder and has awesome padding that never cuts or rubs. The bag just stays where you align it to hang on your back - and more than once, I panicked thinking that I'd left it behind, only to realize it was on my back - it felt that natural and unobtrusive.One thing that MUST be fixed by the manufacturer is that the strap adjusting buckle too easily lets the strap slip when putting on or taking off the bag, thus losing the length adjustment to make the strap length fit my body. I solved this by buying 1x4inch sticky backed velcro strips. Totally fixed. Total happiness. Hey manufacturer - do this and make you bag perfect :-) Thanks for making such a great product.",

It meets the size requirements for a \"personal item\" for airlines, but if you are looking for a tiny sling bag this might not be for you. I love it because it holds exactly what I want...my phone, chargers, power brick, passport, headphones etc. In addition to all that it will hold a small laptop and a tablet, but it can get a bit heavy with all that in it.I also really like the front zip pocket for quick access and the rear pocket for more secure storage. I hope the quality is good and it lasts.",
