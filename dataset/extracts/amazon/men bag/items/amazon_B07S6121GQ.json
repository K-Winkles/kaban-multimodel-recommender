                "reviewText": "The overal desing and functionality is very good. There is no way an iPad can fit in there with a cover as the room is juuuust enough for one as it is. The zippers are solid and don't bind. I use it primarily as a (licensed) concealed carry bag as my pistol is very heavy but the wide shoulder strap does a great job in spreading the weight over a large area making it very confortable to carry. Plenty of room for keys, phone and assorted small items. The USB port worked without issue. The hidden water bottle holder is neat but has a tough time fitting a 20oz. Topo Chico bottle. If you are using a skikkier type of water bottle, it should work ok. I am only deducting one star because while the outer material looks stylish from afar, once you get close to it, you can easly tell its a cheap leather imitation. Looks similar to the \"leatherette\" material used on many entry level car interiors. Despite its \u00e6sthetic shortcomings upclose, it offers good value for the money and I am happy with my purchase. Highly recommend if you need a stylish carry option and grew tired of tacti-cool look of the Maxpedition type of bags.",

It\u2019ll be perfect for my upcoming trip to Austria/Italy to prevent theft because I can wear it in front of me comfortably.",
