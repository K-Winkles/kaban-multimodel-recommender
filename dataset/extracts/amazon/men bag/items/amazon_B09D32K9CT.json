                "reviewText": "I bought this bag to hold a lot of clothing for what is about a 10 hour train ride, with connections, meaning this bag ended up moving around a good deal. It managed to keep my laptop safe while holding about a month\u2019s worth of clothes, and still had some room for me to store some of my other electronics like my headphones and Xbox controller. It\u2019s also very easy to stick a lock through the loops on the zipper to keep your items secure. My only real complaint is that when filled to this extent, it does get a bit wide, a lot of the size being distributed to the sides rather than vertically, which can make it a bit unwieldy in that way, but the strap it comes with helps a lot with this.",
