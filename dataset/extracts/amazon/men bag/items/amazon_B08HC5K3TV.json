                "reviewText": "This is the best padded bag for carrying a laptop computer for travel, business and school I've ever owned. This well made (yes, still made in China) and expandable water-resistant polyester cloth bag also affords plenty of room for additional accessories like an AC power charger/adapter, mouse, external CD/DVD player, headphones, and tablet, as well as pens, folders, small binders, work and reference documents, etc. My 17\" laptop easily fits inside the computer compartment. There are an abundance of compartments and pockets inside and out. You could even carry a few essential clothing items in the expanded section to have if your checked luggage is lost during your flight. The bag has sturdy lockable metal zippers (using a small lock that you must provide), includes an adjustable \"padded\" shoulder carrying strap, and is available in several colors. The sealed EVA foam padding is approximately a half inch thick and provides protection to the back of the bag and Velcroed computer compartment as shown in the listing.The only two very minor issues I have are: None of the interior pockets have zippers or Velcro flaps, so it is possible that smaller items like small portable external hard drives and thumb drives could come out of the pockets and get lost inside the bag or fall out of the bag during use, and the carry handles cannot be \"strapped\" together for ease of carrying and additional strength. There is a small zippered front pocket that could be used to carry external drives and other small items, but this pocket isn't padded for protection. Even with the minor issues, I highly recommend this bag for travel or carry on use and have ordered another for the wife! The quality and price of this bag blow the others out of the water!",

                "reviewText": "Purchased to replace my existing office bag (in need of more space). First impression was that I was probably not going to like it. As I seen in another review, kind of like a duffle bag with extra pockets. While that is a pretty accurate statement, once you fill it up is sits upright pretty well. Not sturdy like a suitcase or traditional computer bag but it is working well for me so far for business travels. The material is nice looking and seems very durable. The deciding factor (to keep) for me was all of the space. Seems the looser relaxed construction of the bag makes it easier to pack and allows for it to hold so much more than my old one. Where I would have been opening the expander on the old bag, this one still has space to spare. Definitely recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I got this bag as a way to protect my new laptop that I use for working on my game programming projects while traveling. I've used it in my tent while camping and settling down for the night, and while visiting friends. There's a dedicated spot for where the laptop goes. It's a bit snug for the Acer Nitro 5, but it does fit nicely. In the other sections, I've got plenty of space for the charger cord, my DSLR camera and its charger, a couple of lenses, a game controller, a mouse, my journal, portable USB chargers, memory cards, flash drives, and other such spare necessities.I haven't used it yet for airline travel, since I haven't used airlines since before covid-19, so I can't tell how well it works for that, but it's of an ideal size for the carry on type based on the bag I used for that purpose so I know it'll work with airlines (unless they've changed bag size limits since 2018).",
