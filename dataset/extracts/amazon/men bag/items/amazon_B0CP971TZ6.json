                "reviewText": "Very impressed with this product's function and how it provides everything as described. It has the ability to whip it open while it is ZIPPED - the tab pulls all zippers open in one move! Allows you to quick draw if needed. Velcro inside that holds the holster (which is included in the bag) is very strong - when you draw from the bag, no matter how hurried, the velcro holds the holster in place inside the bag. Allowing for easy and fast release.It has 5 inside pockets for spare clips. I like how everything pocket or entrance uses a zipper with a tab that is large enough to grab and easily whipped open in a pinch. No small little zipper tab to fumble with. The actual zipper in the teeth is very strong - it's like this bag is ready for whatever happens.The front has three pockets to easily fit wallet, keys or cellphone inside the pockets OR you can use the triangle pocket on the strap to hold keys. it's just the right size. The interior of the bag and pockets are lined with a heavy fabric that appear like a rubber waterproof fabric. But my favorite pocket is the one between your body and the main bag - THAT is the best place to put your wallet, in my opinion. There is even a velcro fuzzy patch on the front where you could attach a flag, other patch, or even your CC permit.",

                "reviewText": "This FLWVOG Concealed Carry Crossbody Bag has a 2 inch wide adjustable shoulder strap. Besides the CCW main pocket, it has 3 smaller flat front pockets, a concealed back security pocket, and a small pocket on the front of the shoulder strap. The CCW main pocket comes with a velcro holster that can be removed or stuck anywhere on the back wall. The front wall of the main pocket has 2 straps on the outside of the 3 magazine holder straps(see picture). All the pockets have smooth operating zippers with easy to grap zipper tabs. The front of the bag is perfect to display your favorite velcro patches.This is a cool bag, great for carrying all my everyday stuff(non CCW). Hand sanitizer, cell phone, pocket knife, pen, Leatherman, tourniquet, band-aids, keys, wallet, etc. It has lots of room for a small bag.The one issue I have for a CCW bag, is the pull strap for the main pocket is a little short in length. It tends to fall back into the main pocket where you can't grab it. This negates the pull strap quick opening option. If it were about 2 inches longer, it would work better. Also, a quick release buckle to make it easier to put on and take off the bag. That would be great!Approximate dimensions:Overall: 8\"L x 3\"W x 10\"H",

Holster will handle most arms and can be repositioned in a secured manner in any direction desired. Main compartment also contains elastic to secure magazines as well as ties leaving more than enough room for a med kit.All stitching appears to be reinforced making the wearing down the product unlikely. Loaded fit is comfortable with a chest and side carry, though it's only really functional for right-handed persons. Zippers all glide with easy to open and close quickly with no snagging. The loop patch for Velcro styled patches is an added plus if signaled or branded patching is required wear.",

The mag holders work quite well and you still have room for other things in the bag, on the strap is the perfect place for me to put my keys so i don't have to put them in my pocket, Only thing that i think are lacking is the quick open strap falls inside not allowing you to use it to open it quickly so i attacked a key ring to it and that helped keep it up.",

But, if you replace one tool for another, it ends up making for an absolutely necessary one-stop-shop for getting any job done. Had more carrying space than expected, can hold an impact drill, with all of your adapters and bits in one partition, all of your measuring in another, tape rolls in yet another compartment... you get the idea. All of your tools are easy to grab, you know, because of the implication",

This bag surely didn't disappoint in any way!The quality of materials is nice, though that will equate to some stiffness before it gets broken in. I very much love the variety of compartments it offers and have found a unique use for each of them. While I don't plan to carry a pistol in this bag, it does come with a universal holster inside that would accommodate most smaller handguns.All in all, this bag is a good value at under $20.",
