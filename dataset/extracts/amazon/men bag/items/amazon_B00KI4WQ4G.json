Have had a lot of bad purchases (gifted to family members), but this covered most of the bases. Wish it were just an inch or two longer, but all in all, study construction, enough places to put things in and the most surprising feature is even with all my crap in it, it still is relatively weightless. Not sure how that happened, but it was a nice surprise. Seems well constructed and if I had any complaint it would be, I'd like to see a little thicker material used. But then it wouldn't be as weightless right?",

                "reviewText": "While I like the quality of the bag, and I love the look, I cannot give it a good rating because of the misrepresentation of its size. The overall size measurements are not correct, and the \u201claptop\u201d pocket size is far too small for a laptop. I have a 14 inch laptop (which is small enough to fit in a 13 inch laptop sleeve) but it does not come anywhere close to fitting into the pocket in this bag. I\u2019m not even sure my iPad in its case would fit in it. Also, the bag does not have much, if any, padding.Because I like the bag, I decided to purchase a protective sleeve, and it now fits perfectly in the main compartment of this bag and is protected. I\u2019m disappointed to have to spend extra money for the protection that I thought this bag would provide, but cest la vie. Yes, I might return it. But, it will make a fine purse if I don\u2019t.I included a photo of the inside of the tag so that you can see the actual measurements, and that the brand designed it for tablets.",
