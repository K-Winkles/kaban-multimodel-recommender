                "reviewText": "I was packing for a trip to Maui and trying to organize my make-up and toiletries for my carry on bag. I have a million little makeup bags from those gift with purchase deals, etc, and I have used quart zip-locks in the past. But it was just triggering my slight OCD tendencies to have stuff in non matching bags of odd sizes, and trying to separate so that liquids would be TSA ready. I found these here on Amazon and thought...do I really need them? YES! Emphatically, YES, I DO! They arrived next day. I ordered a set of three. One holds carry-on liquids and 'wet' makeup, one for 'dry' makeup and q-tips., etc, and another with face wipes, panty liners, face masks, ear plugs, etc, the stuff you want on hand that doesn't need to be pulled for the security scan. The bags have two all around zippers which is so much better than a top zipper, and you could even put a little lock on it. The square shape makes packing easier too. They hold a surprising amount of stuff! I like the handle for quick, fumble-free retrieval. They stack in my backpack perfectly. I am so happy with the quality and size and I might order more because they are just so great for packing anything in a carry on. One for snacks? One for tech cords and earbuds? And not just for travel, they could be used to organize makeup in a drawer, or for craft supplies, kids car toys...the list of possibilities is endless!",

The zippers, clear sides, fabric all feel solid and I'm not worried about it coming apart anytime soon. I really like the handle at the top which makes it easy to carry in and out of the bathroom. The clear plastic sides and fabric are sturdy and I don't think any of my products will put a hole in them.These bags aren't completely waterproof due to the fabric siding. The outside fabric is a suede like fabric and the inside fabric feels similar to the inside of a lunchbox (aka fabric that can take a beating).The 2 zippers haven't snagged and work well on all three bags. I love that there they are sold as three high quality bags in one package. I'm actually excited to use these when traveling!",

Big enough to hold a full-size toothbrush, and more-importantly, the zippers go all the way around 3 sides, so it opens fully like a suitcase. Most other toiletry bags open like an envelope, making it impossible lay the bag flat & access everything easily. Love the clear panels (essential) and like that the sides are cloth instead of plastic.",
