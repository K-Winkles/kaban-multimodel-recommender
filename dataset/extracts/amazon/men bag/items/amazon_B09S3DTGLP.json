                "reviewText": "I like the size of this. Not too large so that it can be used as a Fanny pack. Back slip pocket will hold an iPhone 11 Pro Max, (will fit inside too). In my bag I fit my larger sun glasses will fit (with a soft case), along with my reading glasses (in a soft case), pack of Kleenex, CC holder and mini make up case. On the outside I fit my keys. Will room to fit a little more.Only thing I am not crazy about is that the clip and D ring is plastic (I think the D ring is hard plastic), should be metal. The clips are also very hard to unfasten (not the fault of the manufacturer because this was not meant to be used as a Fanny pack to take on and off. I just switched out the strap to one with a metal clip that detaches and reattached easily for me to wear as a Fanny pack.Also hated the label. I just coloured it black with a sharpie.Great price and the quality is good.Thought it would have been a shapeless bag but it held up well with my items.",

                "reviewText": "Read the dimensions carefully, this may be too small for you. For me, it's the right size. The crossbody strap is comfortable and since it's so light, you feel like you're not carrying anything. Works for me to carry cell phone, wallet, sunglasses in their case, keys. If I took out the sunglasses case, I could fit a water bottle but it may not zip closed with it. I put a hair clip and a pen in each of the outer side pouches right where the strap is attached. I haven't used it with its kangaroo belly attachment, this would make it heavier and I haven't needed that extra small pouch.I found it great for international airport travel - felt like the passport, wallet and cell phone were handy and secure, and the boarding pass was very handy in the back slip pocket. Then put the whole thing inside my backpack for boarding, so they wouldn't want to count them as 2 separate personal items, and it was a good way to keep the important items together inside the backpack.Mine came with a logo in front that says \"street\" in white which I didn't like, so I filled it in with a black Sharpie.",
