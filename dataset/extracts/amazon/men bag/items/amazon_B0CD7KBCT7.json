A detachable zipper for TSA pouch. A hook for small space like an economy restroom on any plane. I use this for my overnight hotel stay where their countertop space is less than practical. I use it for my female locker room / shower after a lap swim. It fits a ton. I had all my 3.5 oz bottles and tube just to test the bag. Oh my gosh. It is so well thought!

I like that it\u2019s not too bulky and can fit my travel sized toiletries and the amount of make up needed for a casual trip. This won\u2019t fit everything like a regular zip up travel case so if you are used to packing a hairbrush or tooth brush in your travel case this produce isn\u2019t for you.",

It has enough compartments to separate my makeup and contacts from my shampoo/soaps, hair products, deodorant, toothbrush/floss, etc. It\u2019s easy to hang when you arrive at your destination and if liquids need to be separated out for TSA, the bottom compartment easily zips off (can also be made smaller that way for shorter trips and will still close). It looks super simple, but the design was SO THOUGHTFUL for someone who actually travels.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This a a really nice toiletry travel case. It was smaller than I expected BUT it holds alot! I was looking for something larger to fit my eyeshadow pallet, but it didn't. Also, full size hair products (shampoo etc) will not fit in these compartments. I should have checked the measurements before. I ended up taking it on vacation because I did not have time to look for something else. It worked out just fine, I carried my pallets and hair products in something else. One area can be unzipped and removed if you don't need it (see pic). The only negative I would say is it would be nice if the strap on the clasp had the ability to betightened, because if you do remove one compartment you cannot tighten the strap to secure and make it tighter. Hopefully that makes sense. Easy to clean. Another reviewer mentioned \"black hairs\" inside the bag. I saw those also, at first I also thought it was hair. But they were definitely not hairs. They are loose fibers/string from the black lining. I'm sure this was made cheaply and quickly in a assembly line in china (tag inside says made in China) where they did not take the time clean up the loose strings. See video review. Hope this helps.",
