The spacious interior easily fits all my beard grooming supplies - trimmer, brush, toothpaste, deodorant, oils, comb, etc. with room to spare. The nylon lining makes the large main compartment easy to clean.Thoughtful features include a handy mesh pocket for organization and a zippered pocket for securing small items. The charcoal grey fabric exterior looks sharp with faux leather accents on the bottom and zipper pull. It's as functional as it is stylish.I plan to use this for upcoming travels and will report back on how it performs. But the size seems ideal - not gigantic yet big enough to hold essential toiletries when sharing with family. It has space for toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, basic hair and beard products, and more.The zippered outer pocket and inner mesh pocket neatly segment gear. The PU leather isn't as durable as real leather, but helps keep costs low. Overall, this affordable, roomy, fashionable toiletry bag gets the job done for daily use or travel.",
