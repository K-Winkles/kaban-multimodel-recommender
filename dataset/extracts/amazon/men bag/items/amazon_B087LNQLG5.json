It's a very pretty purple(:I was able to put it under my seat instead of the overhead compartment, and it's flexible, doesn't weigh a lot.

I use heavy duty plastic bags to transport my wet items home and prevent mold issues, but I love the design (tie dyed style) so if the chlorine does seep in, you can't tell. My favorite features are the internal zipper pouch, which is the perfect size for my phone, keys, and smart watch, and the side compartment for shoes, which *just* fits my size 8.5 tennis shoes.",

I always have stuff to send home with him and the paper bags I was using were not cutting it and would break before he got home. This bag seems sturdy enough, and is convenient with its long strap or the short handles. He has only used it once so far, so I can't really speak about the longevity of it. I will say that it is a little smaller that I thought it would be, but that is my fault. The dimensions are listed. It has handy pockets so things can stay organized, and the zippers seems good. Time will tell if it can stand up to the wear and tear my son will give it. If we run into any issues I will update this review. All in all, glad I made this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "My sister was looking for a gym bag to take to her tae kwon do classes and she likes the color and size of this one. The price is also pretty affordable when compared to other gym bags of the same size and quality. My sister puts shoes, her uniform, water bottle, phone, etc in the bag.I liked my sister\u2019s bag so much that I ordered the same one in a different color. I go to the gym about 4x a week doing physical therapy and tennis and I\u2019m impressed with how much I can fit in it. It has a small zipper pocket on the inside which is perfect for your phone and ear buds. I can easily fit a pair of shoes, snacks, water bottle, a couple text books, deodorant, hair brush, hair ties, chap stick, my wallet, keys, and a whole different outfit with room to spare (it just gets a little heavy and awkward to carry but then you are still getting in the gains even as you walk out of the gym lol). One time I spilled a bubblr next to my bag and didn\u2019t notice it until my bag had been sitting in the puddle for a couple minutes. The bag dried pretty quickly and nothing on the inside of my bag got wet so I was pleasantly surprised.I bought another one of these bags (different color again) as a birthday present for one of my friends who is a weight lifter and goes to the gym a lot as well. She said that the size is just what she was looking for and she loves the inside pocket for her phone.Overall I am very pleased with this bag and everyone else that I know has been as well. I would 100% recommend this bag to anyone who wants a good quality gym bag that isn\u2019t huge.",
