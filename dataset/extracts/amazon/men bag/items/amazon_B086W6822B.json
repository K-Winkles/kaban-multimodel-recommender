Bag seems to be constructed with higher grade materials compared to other bags in the same price range.It\u2019s able to hold everything I could stuff in there and is still comfortable to carry.The oversized zippers make it easy to open and add some comfort knowing the bag can be quickly opened \u201c if needed \u201c\u2026I would have given 5 stars but I have had a zipper pop open twice now. I truly believe I had that compartment overstuffed and simply moved things around, I have not experienced it since. However it was surprising to see since like I said everything seems really stout, just had me wondering if I have a faulty zipper.I would recommend this bag to anyone.",

This bag solved my issue. I keep my grocery and to do list with pen in main pocket, I keep several small tools, multitool, eyeglass repair kit, sewing kit, small first aid kit, safety pins, batteries and superglue in other 2 larger pockets. Flosser picks. small toothbrush and paste, aspirin in small outside pocket. Wipes and some paper towels (folded) in large rear pocket. I added a MOLLE cell phone carrier to the front. Everything I need for every day events. The zippers and pulls are very sturdy. The strap is a little thin but added a small cushion to the strap to keep from shoulder digging. Store, playground, back yard - this thing really is perfect and very small - sits over head on shoulder with bag slightly toward my back to keep my hands free. Love it.",

You don\u2019t want to be that guy who has an ND at Walmart. Luckily it fits my kydrx holster perfectly and easily clips into the Velcro to make drawing my weapon possible.",

                "reviewText": "Great pouch for the money, zips, zip pulls and subdued look in black but too many D rings and not enough capability for expanding. There is also a really cheap &terrible strap and no handle for hand carrying so you have to either replace the strap with one of your own or hold the pouch from the bottom. A little expandability would really help here. For example, when my wallet, keys and phone are in the pack, I can't fit a pair of sunglasses unless they come in a thin case. I'd also like to see a soft-lines area for glasses. It comes with a pretty cool looking carabiner but I really wish it had a better spot for shades and a grab handle since I don't think I'll carry it like a sling.",
