                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Sturdy, Stylish, & Comfy. Great Unisex & Ambidextrous Bag.",
                "reviewText": "I bought the brown backpack (the regular, not the large one). It's lighter colored than it appears in the product's photographs, but that's fine. It may be due to how monitors display colors differently, so keep that in mind while looking at the pictures.This TL;DR review will be broken into sections: A.) Comfort / carry for men and women, B.) Adjustable ability of the straps / how it's good for both left- and right-handed individuals, C.) Security / anti-theft potential, D.) Water / rain / snow resistance, E.) Internal storage capability, F.) My 1 issue with the backpack, G.) The product's bonus gift.A.) - I hate purses, so I wanted to find a small and simple backpack as a replacement. This bag is roughly the same size as my purse, but it holds more, it's much more organized with pockets, and it's easy to carry due to its straps. It doesn't cause me any back or shoulder pain to wear or carry, and (for the women, or endowed men, who might be interested) the cross-strap is padded so it doesn't hurt / chafe / cause soreness where it presses against the breast.B.) - The straps can be adjusted to fit bigger / stockier bodies, and shortened to fit smaller frames. I'm built like a noodle so I usually have a hard time finding straps that will shorten enough for backpacks to fit without sliding / slipping around or hanging loosely, but this worked wonderfully. Depending on the material of the shirt / jacket being worn underneath it can still slide a bit, but not enough to be annoying. Its straps' design makes it easy to maneuver too, so you can slide it around from your back to your side to open it up without having to completely remove the bag to get into it. There are two rings at the bottom on the bag on either side that you can clip the hook onto, making it easy to put it on either shoulder to carry or reach into -- so it's good for both left-handed and right-handed people.C.) - Except for the bottom pouch on the front which has only 1 zipper puller (and thus unable to easily lock), this backpack can be easily made theft-proof. Each zipper has two pullers, and each puller has 2 holes which have enough room to slip a thin [luggage] cable-lock through. So it's easy to lock the two zippers together, and pickpockets can't easily / stealthily open it. And unlike with purses, I don't have to worry about someone snatching my backpack and running off with it either because of how the cross-strap clips on -- making it secure to my body. This doesn't mean it will prevent ALL thefts, but it will deter minor thieves who want quick and easy targets.D.) - While I don't recommend dunking the backpack into water, hurling it into snowbanks, or letting it sit exposed in storms (remember that there are electrical components embedded in the bag!), it's stood up pretty well to precipitation so far. Depending on which way wind or snow is blowing, some could enter the little hole in the top pouch -- but I'm not too concerned about that. If I had electronics in that top pouch while it was heavily snowing / raining, I'd probably just shove a little wad of fabric into the hole to keep wetness out until I was out of the weather.E.) - Y'know the stereotype about women's purses being black holes, carrying an impossible amount of random items? My purse was like that, and this backpack (despite being the same size as the purse) holds MORE. And it has POCKETS! Not an insane amount of pockets (like pockets within pockets like matryoshka dolls), but enough to keep things organized. I can carry my tablet, cell phone, umbrella, lunch, tissues, pills, sanitizer, power bank, books (not textbooks!), cables, writing utensils, lotions, eating utensils, water bottle, earphones, and...well, those are all that I have in it right now but there's still room for more stuff in it. Despite the weight of it all, it hasn't been straining on the straps.F.) - Overall I think this bag is fantastic. The only thing I dislike about it is that the top clip connecting the front of the bag to the shoulder-strap is loose, so every time I tighten it, it just slides like butter to being loose again. That's not a huge issue, as it doesn't prove a hassle -- I just like keeping my backpacks as close to my body as possible so as not to invade other people's spaces, and that loose clip / strap means the top of the bag kind of flops around a bit. When I'm not being lazy I'll probably just sew the clip's strap into place so it doesn't keep sliding loose.G.) The backpack came with a gift: a little leather wallet! It only holds cards, but that's fine. I'd been debating getting something similar to replace my bulky wallet, but now I don't have to because of this present. It's well-made, and even with cards in it, it fits well in my jean's pocket.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I just recieved this bag, so my first impression is that it looks very good. Size is pretty decent, I'm 6\"2 so I think os good enough. A fair amount of pockets to put your stuff away. 2 outside pockets, one on top and one on the bottom. Top one is the biggest of the two. Inside it has 2 small sleeves and a small pocket. A bigger sleave for a small laptop, I put my 10.1 kindle fire HD, fits perfect and it comes with a velcro tab. The charging cable wasn't properly installed, but it wasn't difficult to installed it and it was working.On the cons, I think isn't big enough on the inside, despite the fact that is a great size, not much room on the inside, it is very narrow. Material for the bag looks flimsy and not great, I don't think the bag will stand every day use. Stitches arroumd the zippers looked glued not actually stitched. The inside lining looks weak and in my opinion is going to be the first thing that breaks.I'm going on a trip next week and I will update this review.UPDATE: SEPTEMBER 27Went to New York from Thursday to Monday, dragged this bag to Manhattan and I got to say it didn't let me down. Felt strong and took heavy use like a champ. But still not enough space in the main compartment, basically holds a Kindle fire 10 HD and the New York times Sunday edition. Otherwise looks strong and good.",
