This one checked out with affordability and quality. It uses both clasps on the sides and zippers. None of which have failed me yet I do not frequently unzip and zip so that might be a benefiting factor. It\u2019s not super wide so if you have a very wide laptop, you may find yourself putting it in and out on a diagonal but for most standard size laptops. For paperwork files if it\u2019s fine, it can fit at least a handbook worth without issue could probably even do a decent size textbook with files. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s expandable by a whole lot you will find yourself probably struggling if you try to overpack it I do like that it has multiple pockets on both sides of front zipper rear zipper, it is canvas so it\u2019s pretty sturdy and hold up and it has an adjustable strap. That is also very nice. The stitching is decent and appropriate and I haven\u2019t found any issues with that either. Overall I think for what it cost it\u2019s a good deal.",

                "reviewText": "When it comes to school, I have classes that do not require many books. I was tired of having a worn out Jansport backpack at hand, so I browsed amazon for a cute messenger bag. I came across this messenger bag. It was affordable, I loved the number of pockets it had incorporated into its design, the color-scheme options were aesthetically pleasing to me, and it matched the measurements to just barely fit my Chromebook inside of its main pocket. Those factors alone were enough to convince me to purchase it.For when it came in in the mail, I unpacked it and saw that the loophole for one side of the straps was undone. It was then when I realized that the loop may have broken during transit. The thread that held it in place was loose and practically torn apart. Luckily, I was crafty enough to fix it by removing the old threads and sewing the loophole back into place by comparing it to the other loophole that was in place. It was a hassle, and it killed my mood of having a new bag for school, but it is what it is. I'm glad it worked out in the end.Other than that issue, the quality of this bag was relatively decent. The buckles at the front of the bag are easily adjustable, my school materials were snugly fit inside of the compartments, it's convenient to my needs, and the design was exactly what was displayed.Ultimately, if you're going to purchase this bag, be sure to have materials readily available if it was broken in transit. As for when you use this bag and with how easily one loophole for my bag's strap broke, I advise to not put heavy things inside. Other than that, it's a nice bag :)!",

I bought a perfect size for my school computer but should've gotten a bigger bag so i could use it for my real computer. very worth it if you just need a small bag for school. I do with it came with a shoulder pad, because if you have something you heavy in it, it will start hurting a bit on your shoulders.",

The strap is wide and thick so it won't dig in your shoulder as much. There's not much structure because it's just fabric but it also wraps around your hip so it doesn't bounce much. It's also a little bit bigger than I thought it would be and there's a spot on the bag, probably glue. But overall, I like it.",
