                "reviewText": "I\u2019m very happy with this travel toiletry bag. I got the black color with leather bottom. The size is perfect at about 9.5 inches along the length. Some bags are too small or too big but this one fits everything you need without too much extra space lengthwise. I love how it has pockets along the sides of the main compartment for all the bottled stuff like shampoo, shaving cream, and hair cream pucks. There\u2019s also a wet compartment on side for toothbrushes or soap containers that leak. The third compartment I use to store my less common things like vitamins or finger nail clippers. The ONLY complaint I have is that one of the zipper handles came off during shipment but I quickly remedied this by using one I had from my previous bathroom bag to replace it. No biggie. For the price I give it 5 stars and can\u2019t wait to use it on my next trip.",

Since it was free, I\u2019ve been carrying that thing around and using it. On a whim, I purchased this for a cruise. It held everything perfectly! It was like a bottomless pit lol. I kept putting stuff in and there was still more room. The bag was great holding it shape and protecting everything I had in it. I\u2019m really glad I bought it.
