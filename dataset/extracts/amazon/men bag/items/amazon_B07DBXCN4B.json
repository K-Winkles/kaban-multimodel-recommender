                "reviewText": "I recently had the pleasure of using the Maliton Toiletry Bag for Men & Women during my travels. This large toiletry bag not only offers ample space for all your essentials but also boasts a stylish design that suits both men and women.As someone who carries an extensive array of toiletries, I was thrilled with the bag's spacious interior. There's enough room to fit all my essentials, to skin care products and grooming tools. The thoughtful organization with multiple compartments and pockets made it easy to keep everything neatly arranged and easily accessible.My only gripe with this toiletry bag is that, when filled to capacity, it doesn't zip completely closed. it might be a concern for some users.In that regard, I believe adding an extender zip would be a valuable improvement. This would allow the bag to accommodate even more items without compromising its ability to close securely. I hope Maliton considers this suggestion in future iterations of their product.",
