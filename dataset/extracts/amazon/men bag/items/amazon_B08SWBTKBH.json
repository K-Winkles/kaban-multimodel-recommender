The packaging was so sleek and compact, measuring no more than 6x9 inches \u2013 talk about a pleasant surprise!The material is top-notch, delivering a fantastic feel with an impressive level of sturdiness. I put this backpack through 30 days of heavy use, and guess what? No signs of wear, tear, or stretching! It's a true testament to the quality.Functionality-wise, it's a winner with multiple pockets and backpack slots that cater to all your needs. The only hiccup? The exterior pocket, supposedly for a water bottle, is a tad too small for my liking. And let's talk about the charging slot \u2013 it's fantastic, but wouldn't it be even more convenient on the right side?In conclusion, these travel backpacks are not just stylish but also durable \u2013 a dynamic duo for those on the move. Despite the tiny quibbles, they've got my five-star seal of approval! \ud83d\ude80\u2728 Get ready to turn heads with your sleek new backpack! \ud83c\udf92\ud83d\udcab",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I am writing this review, because I myself rely on reviews before deciding to buy or not something, therefore I am trying to be as objective as possible.The backpack is exactly what it looks - a very lightweight everyday bag for a few essential objects one needs for work or school, but definitely nothing heavy or bulky. I am using the backpack every day almost for more than 6 months and it is very comfortable and lightweight, I can carry my laptop, textbook and a big notebook together with glasses, phone, external battery and still there is space inside for a few clothes or books. It definitely does the job and the best is that it's really very compact and doesn't pup up behind me when I am in the bus or the train.The external material is very good, don't get wet easily and does not get stained easily, eve though I have one stain at the front, but I am not sure you can even spot it at my pictures. The interior is made of a not such a strong material and the separations inside are not well made, so two of them tore apart after a week (see my pictures). The zippers are strong enough (I've filled up the backpack a few times up to it's maximum capacity and they held up well.), but one of the zip holders tore apart after the first usage, so I had it replaced (see my pictures).It is definitely not meant to be used for travel or very prolonged carrying of heavy objects. Several times I had to walk around all day with a few books and in the end of the day my back and shoulders hurt a lot.Other than that, the backpack is sturdy enough for everyday tasks, it's cute and comfortable. It holds the laptop well - just bear in mind that the padding on the sides and at the bottom is not enough to protect it from a blow, so put it inside better in a case. The USB works just fine.There is not enough space for a bottle outside, but I manage to carry mine inside together with a small lunch box.For the money the backpack is good, in case you need something compact, light and relatively durable.",

It doesn't look quite as nice as the pictures, but its still a slim, good-looking black backpack with plenty of space and pockets and all that.However, in December of 2023, essentially out of nowhere the entire thing fell apart. The main compartments zipper lining has ripped apart from the backpack, making it impossible to zip. Both zippers are only on one side of the zipper track. And now you can see fraying in all the stitching. I used this backpack on a daily basis Monday - Friday, but never travelled with it. It just had to hold my laptop and a few notebooks.Its a good backpack for the price point, but I'd rather spend more on something that looks nicer and will last longer. I'd give it 5 stars if it didn't fall apart, but I can only really give it 3 now since it barely lasted a year and became unusable in the span of a couple days.",

                "reviewText": "It's exactly what I was looking for. The bag provided by my work is incredibly sturdy, but it's huge and feels like i have textbooks in it with just a light laptop and keyboard/mouse. This bag isn't anywhere near it in terms of build quality and materials, but I can now fit through crowded spaces and doorways with it. It looks great, and it kept its shape when i had to store a windbreaker jacket in it on a warm day, along with a portable screen, laptop, etc. For the price, you can't complain. Just don't expect it to take a lot of punishment if you're stuffing hard edged things in it quickly (like keyboard, laptop and accessories)",

The price is amazing, the workmanship is largely impressive (one if the inside pouches was poorly stitched). The inside USB cable is way too long, but a relatively minor complaint. No, there isn't a lot of padding, but it's not marketed that way. It holds a lot and the zippers and outside lining are very good quality. I would happily buy this again!",

It doesn't fit my 15\" laptop. Return.",
