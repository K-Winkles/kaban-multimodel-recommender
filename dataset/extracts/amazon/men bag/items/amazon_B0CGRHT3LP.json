                "reviewText": "I used this bag recently on a cruise for shore excursions and also for sitting on the deck poolside. Side pockets are great for water bottles or umbrellas. Inside is great for sunscreen, a reusable bag for purchases, my book, store my sunglasses when not in use, my husbands sunglass case (lol). there is a nice open pocket that was great to slip my phone into. Front pocket was good for my vitamins box, and lip gloss. Highly recommend!",
