                "reviewText": "This bag goes onto my Trek Verse 2 right near the handle bars. It replaces the previous version where this one has a much bigger foot print, and it comes with some reinforced plastic and carbon fiber composite. The cage is very sturdy and stays in shape without deforming like the fabric ones. The zippers are a bit narrow, but glides smoothly enough to open and reveal the large compartment under the cell phone pouch. I use the compartment to store some MIlwaukee M18 battery with a 5 volt step down adapter so that I can get 5-volt DC power and run the wires across the body frame in order to power up the head light and the tail light. This bag has enough compartments to stow things including wallet, keys, phone, and a short drink bottle. I'm quite a tinkerer, so I've been using this as a customized bag for electronic additional peripherals for the bike and it's really popping. The bag itself has a pair of velcro strapping system which aren't very flexible. And it's fully reliant on the long strap to bridge-strap two posts for full stability. I find this a bit unstable because the straps do slide a bit upon some G-pulls, and having a heavy M18 battery in the bag surely adds the instability. I ended up tapping some M5 threaded holes and from the inner side of the bag, I've added some 3D-printed base board to bolt down the bag for an absolute stability. After all, this becomes a very cool and aggressive looking install, along with a stable platform to mount the customized battery pack I wanted. I'm very content to have come across this. This is highly recommended for anyone looking for a large compartment bag and it's got room for imagination and customization if you're up to the challenge. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "This bag is almost an exact copy of my Rockbros top tube bag. Aside from some slight styling and branding, it's basically the same bag. As of the time of this writing, it's only 45cents cheaper than the Rockbros. So I suppose it really boils down to asthetics. If you like the way this looks with the \"Wild Man\" name over the \"Rockbros\", well, there's your answer. Everything in fit, form and function is identical. The Wildman didn't come with a slip cover, but the Rockbros does. So choosing this over the competition? it's 50/50 can't go wrong either way as they make great cell phone holders to watch your GPS and act as a glove box.",

                "reviewText": "Last year, my phone rang while I was biking and I instinctively (and foolishly) fumbled around in my pocket for it. I had done this dozens of times before but this time - in that split second - I lost control of my bike and landed in a neighborhood intersection. Thankfully, no cars were there at the time, but I learned my lesson fast. So, I ordered this bike frame-mounted phone bag and it is great!It attaches (very securely) to the frame via three velcro straps, The main zipper opens to reveal a small storage area and gives you access to the top section that hold the phone in place with wide velcro straps. Once the phone is in position, and you zip up the pouch, the rubbery plastic shield allows you to easily see your phone screen and is excellent in terms of touch sensitivity. It's also water proof, so I've no concerns if I get caught in a shower.It's sich a simple product really, but it makes a big difference and I highly recommend it to anyone who carries their phone with them while biking.",

                "reviewText": "Fits my iPhone 15 Pro Max. The touchscreen works well through the cover, though you can't press the side buttons. The phone is secured with velcro straps, which is much easier to use than sliding a phone up into the pocket. There's a little sun hood but it doesn't add much protection. The inside is spacious with room for a wallet, power bank, and other small items. There are small pockets along the sides. I like the double zipper pulls for access from either side. The velcro straps to attach to your frame are long enough to accommodate lots of frame styles, and you can trim off the excess once you have a good fit.The only knock I could say for this bag is that it's black. I would prefer white to minimize heating up my phone in the summer.",

                "reviewText": "I installed this phone bike bag on my electric bike. 2 of the straps fit perfect but I had to add a small strip of Velcro around the last strap to make it all the way around. (That modification is due to my e-bike. The straps would fit any regular bike just fine.) The phone fits very securely even though it is also enclosed in an Otter box which makes it bulky. The phone\u2019s touch screen responds quickly and there is no glare or delay when typing on the plastic screen of the bag. The bag itself has a nice big zipper that allows the bag to be opened fully with plenty of room inside for car keys, flashlight and other miscellaneous items. We due live in an area that receives a lot of rain so it is important to protect my electronics. This bag will also provide much better protection in case of an accident as it gets my phone off of the handlebars and onto the frame. Happy with my purchase and glad it fits securely.",

                "reviewText": "This bag replaces my old skinny top tube bag (pictured) that I've had for 10+ years. This one is better built. The phones are very easy to control through the plastic window. One caveat: you can't touch any side buttons like volume on the phone. I tried a Google Pixel 6A and a Motorola 2021 G Power in a beefy case (pictured). The beefy case just fits. The phone straps are easy to use and hold the phone securely. It has 2 elastic mesh pockets on the inside sides. A Cliff bar just fits vertically and horizontally. The straps are nicer than the ones on my old bag with an extra rubber flap for the frame. I haven't trimmed the straps yet in my photos like I did for the old bag. I'm definitely looking forward to 10 years of this bag.",
