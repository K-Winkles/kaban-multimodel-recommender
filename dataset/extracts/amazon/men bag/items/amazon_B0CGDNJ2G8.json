                "reviewText": "This is my 3rd 1-shoulder pack I have ordered and recieved. All 3 measured within an each of eachother yet this is the ONLY one that was actually the size it says. So far great quality, and fits everything I wanted. Im so glad I took 1 more chance!! If I hadn't already given the other 2 packs to neighbor kids (which is ALL they were good for) I would take pics side by side. This is the perfect quick throw together bag that holds A LOT but isn't big and bulky! I took this with a weeks worth of mail, 2 water bottles and makeup inside, water bottle and BABW lotion in the outer pockets and a samsung galaxy 22 in the cell pocket. LOVEthis bag.",
