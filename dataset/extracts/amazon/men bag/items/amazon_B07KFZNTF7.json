It fulfills its intended purpose flawlessly, meeting my expectations to the tee.Despite its compact size, this bag offers remarkable spaciousness without hindering my movements. It strikes the perfect balance, allowing me to carry all my essentials while remaining nimble on the go.The thoughtfully designed pockets within the main compartment and smaller compartments are a godsend for meticulous organization, accommodating not only my essentials but also snacks for my little one! I am 6 feet tall and 185 pounds, I initially worried about the strap length, but to my delight, it exceeded my expectations. When fully extended, the bag's strap is the perfect length which is right in the middle of my hip, providing a comfortable and secure fit.This Carhartt crossbody bag is a stellar choice that combines functionality, versatility, and a touch of practicality. I wholeheartedly recommend it!",
