                "reviewText": "I purchased this because my third cheap backpack in the last two years ate the dust. The zippers were sticky, the fabric was splitting at the seams, and I looked like a schoolboy. It was time for an upgrade, this time favoring quality and (hopefully) a bag that will last a long, long time.I decided I ought to buy myself a nice bag for my daily carry. There are many messenger bags around, but what brought me to purchase this one was how characteristic it was. Rather than monochrome brown or black leather, this bag comes in a few colors and have lovely leather straps and buckles. Reviewers seemed favorable, and I really couldn't find a better bag in a sub-$100 price range.When it arrived, it was really tightly squashed into a thin box, so I was initially worried that it was smaller than I had hoped. I carry around a 12.9\" iPad, laptop and a sketchbook, so I really need lots of space.The bag opens easily enough. The front buckles are decorative and actually fasten via a magnet. Another reviewer mentioned that the carrying handle and straps were designed in a way that make the handle useless, but the flap remains closed and secure with my daily carry when I use the handle on the top of the bag.I'm glad to say that, luckily, there's space a-plenty. The front pockets leave plenty of room for a 5-600 page novel, a pencil pouch, a journal, or a water bottle. Or a tasty snack. A sandwich fits, so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f go crazy.There's a large \"main\" pocket protected by a zipper. Suitable for biology textbooks, a binder of any width, assorted \"lost to the ether\" items (chapstick, pencils, cough drops, pennies), or anything else that goes in and out of the bag the most.The main pocket has two inline pockets for things like earbuds, a glasses case, medication, device chargers, or anything else that fits in a generous jeans pocket.On the furthest side of the main pocket, there is a padded section with an elastic band for your electronics. It fits my gigantor iPad and laptop just fine.Finally, there is a nice wide zipper pocket on the back side of the bag. It has a tendency to carry the weight of your devices and to bump against your hips as you walk, so it is probably most suitable for a thin paperback, pamphlets you never wanted, or evelopes you never intend to open.It is a very nice (and nice-looking) bag and clearly is made with quality materials that I hope will last a few years, at least. I would hate to buy an uglier bag! \ud83d\ude02",

                "reviewText": "I've had this bag for a bit over a year now (normally I don't come back and review products so much later but I'd reviewed something else and noticed this in my options to review and thought since I'd had it so long and it's still holding up I'd throw a review out there). I bought it after my mother bought this same bag - I saw hers (which has held up equally well to everything she puts it through for work), loved the design (I've always loved messenger bags but it always seems tough to find a nice-looking one), and had been thinking I could use a new laptop bag. I'm a freelance writer - this bag has traveled with me to libraries and coffee shops as I write my articles. It has pockets for everything, I can fit my planner, tablet, a reporters' notebook, billfold/wallet, folding over-the-ear headphones, pack of gum, water bottle, pens, assorted papers and notes, laptop and cord all inside. This bag will fit a roughly 15-inch laptop - if you have anything past probably 15.6/16 inches, you'll likely need a slightly bigger bag (if you're one of those people with a 17-inch behemoth of a laptop, it probably won't fit in this, at least not easily). Looks-wise this bag is absolutely gorgeous, a classic, rugged look, my bag is brown so I don't know what the other colors look like, but the brown is a beautiful, versatile color that goes with everything. The only thing I'd improve is the water bottle pockets on the side of the bag. They're fine but it'd be great if they were a bit more open/a bit wider perhaps - if I'm taking a water bottle (lately reusable but not always) somewhere, I usually have to make sure the bottle goes in the bag before the laptop to get everything in smoothly and easily. I will say this bag definitely holds up! Summary: Gorgeous, durable, well-made, versatile bag, definitely worth it, can hold everything and then some - I'd always wanted a good-looking messenger bag and something like this was basically my dream bag. Oh, and I forgot to add - the strap is removable so if you want/need to unclip it and just carry it like a brief case that's an option. Also, I really don't get why a gender-neutral item like a bag is branded as \"men's\" because this design definitely has universal appeal!",
