I am happy I listened to him. The bag lets me put everything I need for my daily goings-on. I know where everything is, it being so handy, I do not have my pockets full of everything anymore. It looks like a man thing and at the same time something a woman could use. The canvas material looks strong. Only time will tell how durable it is. It does have enough pockets for all your stuff with an adequate-sized one for your cell phone.",

                "reviewText": "A 3-star review almost seems too harsh for this bag, because I actually quite like it. It's stylish, lightweight, and has a ton of pockets. However, its flaws are a bit tough to overlook.For one, its pockets tend to be small and generally flush to the body of the bag. They have fairly low capacity, and anything that isn't slim and flat will create a large, noticeable bulge. I can put my laptop and two notebooks in there for carrying to class, but I can't put my laptop charger in without causing the bag to distend uncomfortably. Since the Velcro attachment points are on the two secondary pockets, it's hard to figure out what they'll accept. Several of the smaller zipper pockets won't even hold a handful of pencils without messing up the entire bag's ability to close.There's no shoulder cushion, so if you carry heavy books or a laptop, it can start to wear down on your neck/shoulder, especially if you walk around a lot. The strap also has a habit of becoming loose as you walk around, forcing you to re-tighten it frequently. Also, since the point of attachment between the strap and the bag isn't anchored down by anything other than a bit of fabric, the buckle will slip around and end up awkwardly sideways no matter how much you try to correct.Overall, however, this bag is alright for what it advertises as: a stylish messenger bag. It's definitely not a replacement for a backpack, even if your backpack is chronically under-filled. But if you're just going down the street with your laptop and a notebook, it's a nice pick.",
