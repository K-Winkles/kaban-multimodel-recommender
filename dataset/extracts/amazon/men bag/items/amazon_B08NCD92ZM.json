                "reviewText": "this is honestly the best toiletry bag i've ever had. I go to the lake almost every weekend and this thing has some miles on it and its holding up great. the canvas is kind of thin but not too thin too where it affects its durability. i'm a big organization girl while traveling and the inner pockets are perfect for products that are taller and would normally take up more space. I honestly want another because it would be great for hair products if im going on longer trips. Perfect size for weekend everything and week long toiletries.",

                "reviewText": "The bag this replaced, I travelled all over the world with for 25 years so I struggled to find the same one as it surely has been discontinued. What I loved about the other bag is the additional pockets and compartments, which this bag doesn\u2019t have.The outside does have one zippered compartment but it\u2019s a weird size so I do t find it useful. ThisMeans the bag really just has one large compartment inside so absolutely everything goes in and gets mixed up and jostled around.My old bag had a divider in the main compartment that could be folded down if you wanted to (I didn\u2019t) and the size compartments were a little baggy so larger items would better fit (this one is snug fitting). The material is decent quality (it\u2019s held up so far) and the same for the zipper (doesn\u2019t seem very rugged but is also holding up so far.I\u2019d rather have a different bag but isn\u2019t worth the time and effort so I\u2019ll stick with this one for a while.",
