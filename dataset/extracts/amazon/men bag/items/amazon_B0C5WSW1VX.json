                "reviewText": "So I know that this is a makeup/cosmetics bag for travel, but I actually use it everyday at work as a nurse! I use it to store all of my pens, sticky notes, sharpies, dry erase markers, highlighters, pulse ox, stethoscope and many other things! I started a new \u201ctrend\u201d on my unit, and now almost everyone has one! It is easy to pack my things away and put them back into my locker at the end of the day. I also have plenty of room for extra chargers, Tylenol, snacks, and hand lotions! It is a necessity for sure and very sturdy! I have had 2 so far (the first one I had was the size smaller, and I only upgraded to this one when I found it on amazon a year after buying the smaller one)! The zippers are sturdy and do not get stuck, the edges aren\u2019t fraying, and the pockets inside are stretchy and have yet to break(no matter how many pens/markers I shove into them and stretch them to the max!). Highly recommend this bag!",

                "reviewText": "Firstly, I've been using this bag for 5 or 6 months, every other weekend, on average.It has been very handy and I've enjoyed using it overall. It holds a lot of stuff, it has a number of pockets to stash various items in, it has great little loops to hold smaller things, like razors, or makeup brushes, or nail files.2 things I want to note though... it's just (very) slightly too short for toothbrush holder to fit standing up (you can lay it down, but that means that anything else you put in has to sit on top of it, and tends to move more than if it's standing). If you move it closer to the center it's less problematic, but still makes you have to grab the zip part to be extra careful with that. If this compartment is not full, then the toothbrush holder can be angled or positioned differently; if it is full, then the toothbrush holder makes me have to grab the zippers carefully when I'm closing it.Second and slightly bigger issue is that the stitching around the zippered compartment gets caught in the zipper sometimes bc it sticks out a hair. Again, this is a slight problem, at least so far, but if the stitching was a bit farther in, I don't think you'd see this scenario happen as much.See photos for details.",

This was good for me, good pockets along with a big open space, side pockets etc. Sturdy and as compact as it can be. I would actually like to find one that is not as thick but longer, like 8x11 but maybe and inch or two deep as I think that would fit better into luggage, back pack, briefcase etc. But I have tried a number of them and this is the best so far. and it does have a hanger so you can hang it when its open.",
