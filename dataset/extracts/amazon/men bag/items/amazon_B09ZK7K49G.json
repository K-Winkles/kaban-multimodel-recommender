Great size and pocket organization for all the typical go-withs: keys, phone, mask, snack bar, meds etc. This bag replaces a \"free gift\" from an enviro organization. That \"free gift\" light canvas bag was OK when hanging from my shoulder, but turned into a formless blob when I put it on a desk or table. The zippers were tiny and tasfully the same canvas color. So I love how this new bag has tastfully medium size zipper tabs - just the right size! Shiny and easy to see! The PU Leather bag is nice and soft but still plenty firm enough to keep its shape. When I put it on a table, it keeps its shape - it is not a blob. I put it on its back. I call the part with the slant zipper the front. It is impossible to get confused between the front and back of bag, top or bottom. I confess I am now legally blind, but used to have great vision. I think for any type of vision, this bag would be easy to organize and use.",

                "reviewText": "This bag is just the right size for me; not truly spacious but certainly adequate. The pocket on the back is great for a card case/tickets. The larger opening on the lower front easily holds my phone, a checkbookand pen. A smaller pocket under the front flap is useful for eye drops & a pill case.The color is great; a light saddle tan-brown.The zippers are a bit temperamental; they work if you handle them with great care. And the fold down flap on the front is not well planned; it must be unsnapped & lifted to gain access to the opening below it.Perhaps not of the highest quality but this reasonably priced bag is very good looking and keeps all the things i need together and easily accessible.",
