                "reviewText": "I know they bill this as a travel duffle, but it's not big enough, in my opinion, for that use, nor does it have enough structure to the sides or enough pockets to make this a good travel bag. It is also not waterproof.But for gym use? Perfect! It's got a shoe bag, a couple of clear pouches for small lotions, deodorant, etc. Lots of room for a change of clothes and a couple of towels. The outside snap pockets are a good size to fit a large waterbottle, and on the inside, there is a good size waterproof zippered pocket that is big enough for a paperback, or your wallet plus keys. There's also a clear pouch that is waterproof that could be used for basic makeup if needed.The bag looks really nice, with heavy nylon on the outside that has a bit of a sheen to it, and a zippered pocket front and back, with a full height no-closure pocket behind the zippered on on the front. The shoulder strap and clips look to be pretty robust, but they are plastic. The carry handles are nicely bulked out to make them rounded, but they do have kind of a sharp edge on the seam that is pretty uncomfortable.It would be nice if there were also a key fob, and a few larger pockets on the inside. All in all, if you're looking for a smaller, nice looking duffle for the gym, this is a great bag. I wouldn't use it for travel though.",

                "reviewText": "I love this bag, it is a great size, feels really sturdy and well made. It has a nice strap for over-the-shoulder and two side handles for just toting.It would make a great weekend bag, or a good essentials bag for traveling. I always break my packing up into thing that have to go into the hotel now and things that can wait.In addition, for those of us who are crafty, this would be an awesome travel bag for a small loom, multiple skeins of yarn, many reeds and enough space for notions and weaving tools. It could hold any number of crafting supplies and still have room for other essentials like wallet, glasses, tablet and snacks.I really like the lovely dark blue color. It came shrink wrapped and folded, but I have no doubt it will fill out and get smooth when filled up!",

                "reviewText": "I love this duffel bag, which I got in navy blue to match my other luggage. I plan on using it as a flight carry-on bag during a trip I have planned next spring. The high-quality fabric is well-constructed and durable, with padding, so I expect it will hold up over time. There are many pockets on the outside, which will make it easy to pull out my iPad, phone and glasses during the flight. And it comes with a small bag for essentials (which is all you really want on the plane anyway) and a shoe bag. This is a great bag to carry the basics with you. For example, we\u2019re staying the first two days in one location, so I plan to carry what I need for two days in this duffel, with the rest in my checked luggage. That will make it easier on the flight, and easier on the first leg of the trip, too. In addition, this duffel will be helpful on road trips \u2013 why lug a big suitcase to a place we\u2019ll be for one day, when a small number of items can be packed in this duffel instead? I\u2019m so glad we ordered it.",
