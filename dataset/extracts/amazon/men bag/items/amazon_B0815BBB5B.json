                "reviewText": "The time came when I had to move my recently widowed 94-year-old Mom into an assisted living facility, which is a 7-hour road trip away from where I reside, which means I'll be calling a hotel my home whenever I visit her - SO - I needed to find a new \"portable toiletry cabinet\" for these trips, because the one I usually use for pleasure travel/vacations is smaller and just won't get the job done in this situation . . . so I spent a good amount of time on Amazon researching their huge selection of toiletry bags, and am VERY GLAD I found this excellent one !...it's VERY well-designed and VERY WELL MADE, with quality fabric and zippers, a great rotating hanging hook which makes where it gets hung much easier, and SOOOO much room for everything I was hoping to bring with me & then some !...the three elastic-topped mesh pockets in the back of the main compartment are very helpful because they act as a kind of \"back-up\" that the (larger) items I put in front of them lean against them and stand up straight & don't fall over...and the front zippered mesh pocket is nice and flexible, even a bit \"stretchy\", so it holds more than I thought it would (yay !) - so yes, I did find the \"portable toiletry cabinet\" I was looking for, thanks to this winner . . . Thank You, AVAJEX ! ! !",

You can feel that it is waterproof. I have packed this full for granddaughter and son for Xmass. For when they travel. Its a nice size compares the ones I checked. Thats important when you travel. I like that it has a lot of the elastic thingy things to put your bottles in. Good size pockets also. The stich on the hook seems to be very good quality. For sure that is a must have. Been hanging on chair for a month now and dont seem to have problems getting in and out of it, as per zippers, etc. With out any damage. Would recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I got this primarily for traveling- it has so many compartments and works great for holding travel-sized containers of shampoo, conditioner, lotion, etc. but it also has loops for makeup brushes, a razor, etc. and some more discreet pockets for things like tampons. Highly recommend. Very sturdy zipper and one of the little clear compartment bags that attaches with snaps comes off - perfect size to bring on a plane with some carry-on sized lotions, etc. and then you can snap it back on when you get there if you want. Hangs on any door or bar so you can easily just hang it in the bathroom and not have to store it.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the vaJex Travel Toiletry Bag, and overall, I found it to be a decent toiletry organizer for both men and women. The bag's design is simple and practical, with enough space to accommodate all my essential toiletries during my travels. While it didn't blow me away, it served its purpose effectively.One of the standout features of this bag is its large size, allowing me to pack everything I needed without feeling cramped. The multiple compartments and pockets were well-designed, providing ample space for different items such as toothbrushes, razors, skincare products, and more. It was particularly helpful to have a dedicated section for liquids, ensuring no accidental spills occurred and preventing any potential mess inside my luggage.On the downside, I would have appreciated a bit more structural support for the bag. While it did have a hook for hanging, the lack of reinforced walls made it a little flimsy, especially when fully loaded. Additionally, the absence of any additional features or compartments for smaller items like earrings or hairpins was a missed opportunity for better organization. I use this for the GYM and it may be a little big for the GYM.",
