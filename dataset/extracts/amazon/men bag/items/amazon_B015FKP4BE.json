The strap *could* be 6\" longer to allow for a more comfortable backpack-style wear but it's fine, would most-definitely buy again. Great bag.",

The only caveat is that there is really only big compartment even though it is \"somewhat partitioned\" so when you take one item, something else my slip out or come up with the item you want to get out.There is also two handle strap which makes it a bit lopsided when you quickly grab one handle strap and not both.It worked pretty well for me, but I couldn't find a similar bag that I had before, so I settled with this one.",

                "reviewText": "This bag is amazing and just what I have been looking for. In the pictures, I dropped one piece of brightly collared item in each pouch to show the depth of it. The front zipper pocket on the flap along with the back zipper pouch is deep enough to cover my whole hand and then some above the wrist. The pouches on the inside can only submerge my whole wrist. The main biggest compartment is big enough to fit nearly my whole arm, stopping just above my elbow. If I wanted to, I could fit two DnD books inside and still have room. The main concern I have always had with purses is that when there are pouches, chances are the purse well bulge. As shown in the pictures, I could jam the thing full with random things and It will still look flat. There is also an extender on the purse. If I were to say put books in there, it would expand outwards to allow me more room. I did buy the biggest one there was but tbh, the biggest one is the best. You could either have it small with a few things in there or for traveling for hours to a day or so you could pack it with drinks, entertainment, snacks, and maybe even an extra pair in clothes if you organize just right. There are also pencil holders on both sides of the bag. Can fit 3 on each side if thin but it would be cramped. I would suggest 2 considering under the flap, you could put hesdphones and pencils on the inside. Only problem I have with the pencil holders Is that it isnt deep enough so some of my pens i can't hook it into the holder(I don't want it to slip out without noticing so it is wise to have it hooked on or not at all). My previous purse had many pouches but it would become very bulgy with only the necessary stuff that was in there(hand sanitizer, wallet, drink, Headphones, Charger, etc) so it would make it have less room. Even with the pouches on the inside of this purse filled with things, you could still feet things in the depths of it. Not to kention this purse is only a few inches taller than my old one! This is the purse I have been looking for, for a year. The strap is also surprisingly comfortable considering the material looks like some strap you would find on a cheap purse that feels scratchy. The strap on this purse defently isn't the same case. It is soft and durable, and can be adjusted to a really low height. I've had it for a couple of weeks now and it doesn't feel like it would break any time soon. I would highly recommend this purse, especially the largest size, because you defintly get your moneys worth and can't go wrong with it. Hope this review really helped everyone!",

(never dealt with wet messes though like spills or anything, only ever crumbs and so forth)- the leather zipper pieces on mine arent sewn together all the way around, it doesnt bother me at all but as a nitpicky person such as myself, i know stuff like this can be a big deal for some, so i wanted to mention it- it holds a lot of stuff, i can even stuff things in it if i have no other hands to carry things and it almost always gets the job done, id say the size is very nice yet not too big!- i had bought it for my ipad pro (11 inch) that i bought last christmas because my previous bag wasnt big enough and im beyond happy i made the decision to buy this one specifically, its definitely my favorite bag in a long while.((pictures are from when i first got it back at the beginning of the year, and the zipper picture is from today, august 12th))",

The color seems like what I expected (I wouldn't have really cared if it was different, I just didn't want black or grey), it didn't smell, have stains or anything strange going on with it.It holds my Amazon Fire HD 10 (11th Generation) 2021 AND it's Bluetooth Keyboard - or my Vastking Kingpad K10 Pro Tablet - with it's slightly larger keyboard - without any issues. I had a real problem finding a bag that could fit the Vastking, with it's pen. In fact I just put both in, for fun, with their keyboard cases - and BOTH fit, which I was NOT expecting. BONUS!!I already have a smaller hardcover notebook in it, a battery pack, my Galaxy S21 phone, a few cables and a charger - it could easily hold more. Lots more. I have another bag, which I do use for all my 'extras' - I wouldn't actually need it for this bag. That said, if you want quick, organized access to various smaller things a different bag might be suitable (I shot it's picture for comparison, the grey one).It has many pockets, far more than I need, including two on the side. Might fit a small H20 bottle - but in a million years I wouldn't put liquid near computer equipment to ever find out. There were two listed when I bought mine ($17). It doesn't look used or returned. It was packaged well and all the zippers work. The others are listed at more than double that price. Unless they are larger (which they don't appear to be) $40 - $50 isn't worth it, at all. But the $17 I paid most definitely was worth it. I is going to be easier to cart this one around, plus it looks much nicer, than my storage case and it could hold everything I have in that storage case if I wanted. But I would have to go 'digging' to find the things I wanted.I would also say it is not something to be hung off a bicycle, or smashed around on a major bush tour or something (I have that kind of stuff, too, for my camera equipment). But it is a good, basic bag, with loads of room ( seeing as it held my two tablets and my cell phone plus my junk- and that was at best 50% of the space). Would happily rec'd this!",
