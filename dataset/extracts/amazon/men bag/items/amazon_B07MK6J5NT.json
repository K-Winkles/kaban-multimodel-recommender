                "reviewText": "Navigating the intricate world of pilot training requires not only skill but also the right equipment - and KROSER's 17.3 Inch XL Travel Laptop Backpack delivers splendidly on that front. As an aspiring pilot, I've found that having a reliable backpack is indispensable, and this one checks all the boxes.To start with, its spacious design is commendable.

Yet, KROSER accommodates all of them with ease, ensuring I'm always prepared for my training sessions. No more leaving a vital piece of equipment or a crucial book behind!The Hard Shell Saferoom is another feature that deserves high praise. It adds an extra layer of protection for delicate items, ensuring they remain safe and secure. For someone like me, who values my gear, this feature is an absolute boon.Furthermore, the inclusion of an RFID pocket showcases the thought KROSER has put into modern-day needs. It's not just about carrying items but also ensuring security in a digital age.In terms of comfort, the backpack does not disappoint. Despite packing it to the brim, the ergonomically designed straps distribute weight evenly, ensuring I can move effortlessly from one session to another.To sum it up, KROSER's Travel Laptop Backpack is more than just a storage solution; it's a reliable partner in my journey through pilot training.

                "reviewText": "I bought this backpack after a lot of deliberation, to replace a previous one from a different brand that I immediately disliked, and which started falling apart immediately as well. By comparison, this one is obviously much better (a low bar, but I do like it overall). The biggest issue is the laptop compartment itself, though - it fits my large laptop fine, and it does fit fairly snugly in the sleeve, making it easy to carry around with you, however the sleeve itself feels kinda flimsy, and it just barely fits around the top, too, so I'd be a lot more worried about damaging it if it got dropped wrong, than I have been with some other laptop travel backpacks I've used (sadly, my favorite one doesn't quite fit the new, slightly larger than 17.1 inch screen laptops they're making these days). Still better than nothing, though, obviously, and it'd be fine on a plane, I'm just a little more cautious when I get to the hotel and haven't unpacked yet. It's padded, just not *very* padded (and no padding for the top). Unfortunately, I didn't really see any that were much *more* padded, either. (At least none that still fit large laptops like mine - and this one does, if barely.)In terms of space, though, overall this wins. I do miss how my previous backpack had two decent sized \"primary\" compartments, the one with the laptop compartment, and another separate one, that were both pretty big. This one has the laptop compartment that's exactly the right size for a laptop, then one enormous compartment, and two much smaller ones. That's a pretty minor complaint, though. The smallest compartment has a pouch for a tablet (or just two separated spaces for your small items), the second, slightly larger smaller compartment has a bunch more separated small pouches inside (including one with an internal zipper). then the main compartment accordions out a big, so it can fit a decent sized package, or more clothing than you'd expect from a backpack this size. But I've also flown with it and not had a problem getting it under the seat. (Only the main compartment is particularly useful for filling with clothes, though. The other two are clearly designed more for pills, keys, paperbacks, small electronics, etc.)There are also two small zippered pockets on the side, and a third on the top. The one on the top contains a *removable* hard internal pouch for holding a pair of sunglasses - I was actually going to complain about it (it gets in the way, if you aren't using the space for sunglasses)... until I looked at it again just now, and yeah, completely removeable. (I use it for coins and things, since it's the easiest to access.) Each side also has a small outer mesh pouch, which looks like you'd use it for holding things like water bottles, but I can't stress enough, they aren't large enough for full-sized water bottles to fit comfortably without falling out - my only other real complaint about the backpack. The main compartment does also have a space for plugging in a usb power bank (it doesn't *contain* one, you can just plug one in.) Then you can plug your own usb cable into the outside, and charge a phone that way. It's kind of a neat feature, though I don't really use it much. Works fine, though.It does fit comfortably on my back, with a decent amount of padding - we finally went on the Alaska cruise we booked in 2019, a couple months ago, I took it all over Alaska for a couple weeks, I can say, it's a lot more comfortable than my previous backpack. Feels a lot sturdier, too, though I haven't had it for a terribly long time, yet. I just wish I could find one like this, just slightly more padding for the laptop pouch. Overall, I'm happy with it, though - way happier than my previous one, though admittedly that's a low bar.",

I wanted this mainly for work-travel when carrying a laptop with me for flights. I love the fact it has a strap to secure it on top of my roller bag if needed. Also comes with a zipper lock, which could be handy at times. I also like that it has a pocket on the top for sun glasses. Genius. I'm always wondering where to put those when traveling and hate to put them in a side pocket or with other items that may scratch them. Although my sunglass pocket on top didn't have the plastic internal protector that I saw in a video review. Should be okay. It seems big enough to hold the case the sunglasses came with.",

I used it on a road trip to hold cloths in addition to tech. This is very spacious, lots of pockets and stuff to keep things organized and can hold a variety of stuff. My laptop is secure in the special pocket, which is also lightly padded. I would feel comfortable putting this through luggage on a plane (I haven't as I dont fly often). I will say I don't use this regularly as I work from home, so it's not an every day backpack or anything, but the durability seems great. The handle is reinforced with wire so even if you load it up, thats not going to rip. It's comfortable to wear, even when loaded (which I have done), and the zippers and material all seem solid. Its still like new. Hard to believe the LTT backpack is $250 when this is a fraction of that and every bit as good.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a motorcyclist / adventurer, and my backpack is a daily necessity. I've used it consistently for 4 months now before leaving this review:PROS:+ This bag used to cost about ~$130CAD, and the price has since dropped to an unbeatable VALUE ~$70-80CAD (at the time of this review) which I would put as the primary selling point here!+ For that price tag you're honestly getting a lot. The build quality is really PREMIUM. Materials are thick, and stitching is similar to a lot of premium suitcases (Like Swissgear / American Eagle). It does not feel flimsy in the least and looks expensive and premium. I expect it to last a long time.+ AESTHETICALLY speaking, this is one of the best looking backpacks I own. It retains it's shape / form pretty well, unlike many backpacks that look like 'Sacks' and just collapse into itself when empty. The color is actually pitch black by the way, the images on amazon / or even the customer reviews are a bit overexposed / bright and misleading (appears as dark grey).+ In terms of SPACE there's plenty of room and pockets for everything. I'm able to do grocery runs and fit a LOT in here. I even attached a bungee cord outside (as seen in images) to hold my helmet and additional / oversize bags, and the backpack shows no signs of wear despite the weight and heavy use.+ I'd also like to say as a rider and considering the weight I load into these bags the CHEST STRAP is an absolute necessity to me, and really adds COMFORT and fastens it to my body!+ The GLASSES / Sunglasses compartment is hard shelled and it's something I never knew I'd need. The Pocket / Extension for a POWERBANK too makes it convenient to charge. These are two things I no longer have to unzip and dig through my bag to search for.+ I also loathe those laptop bags that unzip all the way down and just split in half. I always imagine them unzipping while I'm riding. This laptop compartment fortunately unzips halfway as you'd expect.+ Handle is soft and cushiony and unlike many bags I own, it feels nice in my palms even when heavy.+ Straps are also quite wide and distributes weight well over the shoulders even when heavy.+ The red bits are actually little loops you can attach keychains, charms, and little bits to, to personalize the bag a bit to your liking! :)+ I would buy this bag again in a heartbeat, and don't see myself using any other bag. I compared many options / prices, before I settled on this one.CONS:These are really just nitpicks and aren't actual problems.- There's no hardshell in the laptop compartment. Some bags I've used in the past had shells that were curved into the arch of my back adding to comfort and ergonomics. This also meant the bag was less likely to fold / collapse when empty.- USB wire is one piece. I'd rather it have been a separate cable so if it wears out it can be replaced. A braided cable would've been more durable. It's an ordinary wire so treat it with care.- The nets on the side for water bottles are the only flimsy part imo. The nets are not meant to hold the weight of a heavy water bottle, maybe just a small coffee flask / canned drink. Mine ripped slightly, nothing a few stitches couldn't fix and reinforce, but I put my bottles inside the backpack or in the main side zipper pockets instead.Hope this helps! \ud83c\udf0a",
