                "reviewText": "I let this sit around before I cut the tags off...debating to return or not. it sort of grew on me. It is a good size, not too large or too small. The front pocket holds my iphone 11 with a case but takes a tiny bit of maneuvering to get it in with a pop socket attached...easy enough to get the phone out. The small middle pocket will hold my slim travel wallet no problem...too small for a passport though. The back largest pocket holds my Kindle Fire 8\" with a case and an Amazon Basic zip pouch. The zipper opening is short, but it is not hard to get the tablet in there. No problem if the zip pouch is not included.The front pocket is \"ventilated\"; many tiny holes...great if you want to stick buttons onto your bag.I wish this had a key strap and maybe some sort of internal pocket in the largest pocket. I am using cheap canvas zip pouches to help organize this area a little bit.I bought this as sort of a supplement to a backpack when traveling. I can stow the backpack and keep my travel essentials (wired ear buds, tablet/phone stand, sanitizer, wipes, tissue, snacks etc.) in here. I like that as a right side carry (the strap can be changed at the bottom), when I bring it from back to front, the zippers are facing up and make all the pockets very accessible. There is a loop at the top of the shoulder connection and I have attached an s-biner to it (any carabiner will work). Haven't tried, but maybe can use it to attach a water bottle. No comfort pad on the strap...not a deal breaker, but would have been nice.For the price, i think this works for me with some adaptations.",

If you careful pack item it can hhold quite a bit. I add a full size water bottle in stainless steel, some booklets , tissue, recyclable bag, some cosmetics etc. I also liked that I can put it across my body without all that bulk of a larger purse.",
