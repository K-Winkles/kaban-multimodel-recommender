The size of this bag is just about perfect, it will fit a change of clothes and a fluffy bath towel. I love the side pockets to easily find things. I store my shampoo/body wash bottles in one side, my jump rope, keys and airpods in the other so I can quickly find them without rooting through all my clothes in the gym bag. I love this and bought it a second time to replace the original. I did try a different bag off of woot, but didn't realize how much smaller it was and it didn't have the side pockets.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this bag & have been using it for about 3 months now. I have just one complaint, but will list the good things, first.... This bag is just the right size to hold a change of clothes, towel, shoes, etc., with a little room to spare. So, it's a very good size to use as a gym bag. And I like the \"quick-access accessory compartment\" in the front of the bag, where I store my combo lock, ipod & earbuds. Also, the design and colors look sharp. Now, the only bad thing that I have discovered, is that the bottom of the \"quick-assess accessory compartment\" has begun to rip at the bottom. So, I can no longer place, for example, coins, in there. Otherwise, they will fall through that small rip and be lost in the bag's inner-lining.Keep in mind, I have only had this bag for 3 months, and have just been using it about 3x per week. And, this has already happened. So, I'm not too happy about that. However, this is my only complaint, and I still like this bag a lot. Plus, the price seems very fair. So, I will just know not to put coins in that front compartment. ;) lol.I would still recommend this bag.",

                "reviewText": "For about a year now, this duffle bag has been my gym buddy. Its style is appealing and I've even snagged a few compliments. The size is just right, not too big or small, and the compartments are well thought out - especially the one for shoes, which I find particularly useful.However, I did run into some issues. The zipper occasionally gets stuck, which is a bit concerning as I don't want it to give up on me in the future. The material, while appearing decent, is a bit on the thin and stiff side, which might explain why it feels slightly less durable. In fact, I'm pretty sure it wouldn't hold up well if I were to pack in heavy stuff.Despite these hitches, the bag still serves its purpose for light gym use and stands out in terms of style. Therefore, I'm giving it 4 stars. It's not flawless, but it's been a solid gym companion for me.",
