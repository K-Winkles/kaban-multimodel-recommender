                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this little bag. It\u2019s smaller than I envisioned, but still works. I wish they\u2019re use the same style and make a slightly larger one, but keep everything the exact same otherwise. It\u2019s everything I wanted in a sling/backpack. The material is a hard rugged waxed canvas and it\u2019s top notch. The colors of everything blend perfectly and beautifully together and I like the arrangements of pockets. It\u2019s very lightweight but durable and it was packaged quite well. It will go with me everywhere! I am a backpack fanatic and this forces me to go minimum, but I\u2019m willing. PERFECT for a small everyday carry. I\u2019m addicted. Should they use the same pattern to make a medium size, I\u2019m all in! It\u2019s very stylish. I can\u2019t say enough about it. If you are looking for a size just big enough to carry a few items for a day out, this may be the one for you. The green is my favorite color and it\u2019s a good shade of green to give it that vintage, rustic look. As soon as it came up on my search at Amazon, I knew it was the one for me! I truly hope it holds up through use ahead. I will put it to the test and we shall see. I\u2019m so excited to make this my everyday carry. OK, I\u2019m done with the review. Now to spend time with my favorite bag. \ud83d\ude0a\u2764\ufe0fUpdate-I have been using this sling bag every day since the day it arrived. I know this is \u201cthe one\u201d for me because normally I switch bags about every week. I\u2019m not a purse girl by any means, but the rugged back pack has alway been my thing. I luv, luv, luv this bag. It\u2019s holding up so far so good. I mainly use it as a sling. I\u2019d still like to see the exact same style but in a slightly larger size. It makes for a light bag, so stylish and just fun to have wherever I go.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is one of the most versatile bags. I know it is labeled for a man, and appearance-wise it definitely could be used by a man; however, it has so many pockets and storage that it would be absolutely perfect as a shoulder bag or mini backpack purse for a woman, too.STORAGE CAPACITY: It has 4 zippered pockets on the front. All of them are excellent in size, with even the smallest front one fitting a full-sized smartphone with room for more items -- and even this one is deep enough that if I didn't want to zip it and use it as a slip pocket for my phone (for easy access) it would still seat very securely into the pocket without risk of falling out. Two of the larger compartments can unzip almost a full 270 degrees for full access to the compartments if needed (I prefer to just partially unzip to use as a purse, but the potential is there). One of the horizontal pockets it very deep, but the zipper is fairly short horizontally, so it fits a cell phone, but wider items won't be able to fit through the zipper -- but this is just one of the pockets. The bag is very wide on the bottom, so lots of room to expand, which increases its capacity. I can't quite fit a large iPad in the main compartment, but I can fit an e-reader and a smaller tablet without problem.On the back there is a very deep, padded compartment. Its location makes it secure against your body (great place for wallet or phone), but it has easy access as it isn't zippered but rather closes with a snap flap. It is also large enough for a phone and an e-reader or small tablet.STRAPS: So many options. There are 3 straps, and they are each fully removable. There is a single wide woven strap that is very comfortable to use over the shoulder. It has a 3-prong attachment at the top and can be attached at the bottom side for right or left shoulder. There are also 2 fully removable backpack straps that are fully adjustable and have great amounts of length if needed. They can be used together and attached at the top sides or you can attach one or both at the top center -- depending on your comfort. You can also remove all 3 and use the handle to carry.MATERIAL: From a distance this has more of a leather appearance, but it is a waxed canvas. Up close, and to the touch, the canvas is obvious but very nice looking. Water beads on it and even after several minutes was not absorbed into the material. There is also nice detailing with tan stitching (different shade than the canvas material) and leather zipper pulls. Overall, it has a pretty high-quality appearance to it and seems pretty rugged and durable.No issues or concerns with this bag. Lots of options for storage and really offers a huge amount of space for its smaller outward appearance and without being a huge, bulky bag. Also, excellent options for carrying it, so very comfortable to wear. Has a look that a man could carry without issue, but also suitable for a woman. High marks all the way around.",

I came across the same exact bag on temu for a lot less and it is a good little bag, but for me it is a bit small im a big guy and all though it does fit well it is smaller than I expected . the dimensions are posted, so I recommend you get a measuring tape and see if it works for you before you order it, the bag is nice and sturdy. The zippers feel good. The pockets are deep but just not too wide or long. Definitely well-made and worth what they\u2019re asking for here. So if you\u2019re looking for a smaller compact, well-made bag, I do recommend,",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this strictly for carrying my camera around during shoots, and a lens, maybe a wallet. It is a tad smaller than I hoped for, my tablet does not fit inside (I have a Samsung 7.1 inch tablet), so I am not sure whose brand the video/picture shows as fitting in the backpack.That being said, the overall quality of the backpack is excellent. The straps are heavy duty cotton, the zippers are heavy metal, even if the teeth are not. I like the leather straps at the end of the zipper, makes it easier to zip and unzip. I like that the flap protects the mesh back pocket and the strap goes all the way around the backpack (good security). Although the safety buckle is in the back of the strap, backside ofo the backpack, it is not too easy to open.I was concerned that such a marvelous backpack did not have metal latches for the loops, however, I checked my laptop bag (which I have had for years and carried everywhere) and both bags have the same kind of durable silicone latch hook and the loops are also heavy duty silicone. My laptop bag has lasted all these years, I expect this backpack to live up to the company high standards as well. The interior lining is strong nylon, seems to be waterproof. Excellent interior pockets to keep documents private.This backpack is well constructed, and seems to be able to take a beating.Great backpack for my camera/shoots.Overall, I am very pleased with the quality, hence rated it 5 stars, although I have the two concerns.",
