                "reviewText": "About 20 years ago, I had a canvas messenger bag that I loved. Olive green, very simple, 2 pockets, everything I needed for a walking commute. I stopped using that bag when I started carrying a laptop, and got more and more complex bags and briefcases. Now, finding myself needing a simple bag to go to and from music rehearsals, but carry a binder, microphones, folding stand, in-ear-monitors, etc., I went back to basics.I couldn't be happier with this bag. The price was super affordable, and compared to the looks of other similarly-priced bags, it seemed higher quality, thicker material. And I was right! It practically feels padded with how thick the canvas is, and I think that's helpful for some of my electronics. I'm not sure I'd entrust it to carry an expensive laptop and protect against a drop, so I would get a secondary padded bag if I needed that (and that's what I recommend for you if you are planning on carrying this for laptops).The front 2 pockets are roomy, and the velcro attachment to close the bag accommodates a LOT. You can fill the main compartment and both pockets as full as they'll go, and it will still close. The only time I couldn't get it to close was when I tried to stash a microphone stand on top of the bag and have the front cover drape over top of it to secure it in place. And it only barely didn't work...I could have managed an umbrella or smaller object up there.I am very happy with my purchase. Thanks for reminding me that there are occasionally well-priced items that still maintain some aspect of quality!",

                "reviewText": "Its a decent bag. The only real big con is the handle is somewhat small for my hands, but other than that it feels comfortable and sturdy.I like how much it will stretch out for the adjustable shoulder strap. I actually had to do it halfway for me to feel just right. I enjoy the side pockets, i didn't know it came with side pockets initially, didn't notice it but they will hold a 16 oz bottle decently snug. Nothing bigger i think though. the two side pockets are nice. I only really use it to carry one thick reading book and a shirt but i know it can fit quite a bit more, but i don't like it to become bulky.Not really a con but the olive brown doesn't look to olive or green, mine looks more of a sand tan color but it looks nice. It did fit my 15 inch laptop quite fine but then i don't think id put anything else in there as to not damage the laptop i think.",

I fit all kinds of stuff in this bag despite it's low profile.-Adjustable shoulder strap that is semi-padded.Con's-The velcro is a joke. First off, there's not near enough. One thin strip on the inside of the flap & two small pieces on the side of the bag. Even when the bag is fully closed, the slightest bump or rub will cause it to seperate.Second, the placement of the velcro means if you fill this bag even some-what full, the flap cannot be velcroed shut. It will just lay there, flapping in the wind, completely unsecured.Third, why is there not two more pieces above the side pockets?? That way you can still secure the flap when the bag is full. This really boggles my mind - 10 cents worth of velcro & problem solved. If I have to go buy a glue-gun & velcro to use your product, there's a problem.-This bag could easily be 1-2 inches taller. I am constantly left wanting for this bag to be just a little bit deeper. Also, you can forget about toting your laptop around in this.",
