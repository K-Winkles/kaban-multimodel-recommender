                "reviewText": "I bought this for a 3-week European vacation that involved planes, trains and a cruise ship. It was great! The material is very sturdy and the size was perfect. It holds a lot! There are large, deep elastic sleeves for holding bottles (or other tall items), two zippered areas, and a very large central area for everything else (I could fit a smaller bag inside this space). Closed, the bag resembles a large lunch sack. There is another zipper pouch on the outside of the bag, which was great for grabbing things out while on the plane without having to open the large zipper and lifting the flap. I carried this bag inside my student-sized backpack with ease and that allowed more room for clothes in my carry-on luggage bag. While on the cruise ship, it hung in the closet outside the bathroom door. This was a great buy for under $12.",
