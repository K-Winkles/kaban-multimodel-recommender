Out smaller pocket is perfect for a wallet and keys (even a FOB key). The pocket just next to that is ideal for a cell phone (even a larger one, like an Android Note). Then the inside zipper pocket has enough room for everything else (half-sheet paper sized document - like a piece of paper folded in half)... as well as having two small inner pockets in the main zipper pocket. The strap is adjustable so you can make it fit no matter what height you are. The material is pretty-much waterproof and durable enough for what it is, yet it's pretty lightweight. The only issue I've ever had with it is that it is not easy to take on and off if you are wearing a large winter coat with a hood that you hardly ever use. So in that situation, I just unzipped the hood from my coat. This bag fits the needs of most men and is low key enough so you don't feel like you are carrying a woman's purse. A+.",

                "reviewText": "I really wanted to like this bag. Overall build quality and design was great. Great pockets, and compartments o' plenty. Really nice to organize your various items, and it was nice that it had a low profile, but if needed, could hold a good amount. Nice big zippers that don't get stuck easily. It is very utilitarian. Inside material and construction also seemed of decent quality and build.The bad: the outer material, though waterproof, just felt cheap. It is a plastic/rubbery type material. I gave it a chance, it could either be really good or really bad. But it felt cheap. Turns out it was pretty bad. Upon minimal use over a couple weeks, it punctured very easily. I imagine it wouldn't last very long without tearing. I was transitioning from a backpack to this style of man-purse/side bag, so I really did not use it much as I was trying to get used to it. I was actually shocked and probably disappointed that it did not hold up. I really otherwise liked this bag and have tried others. This really was the best.Why the cheap external material? Why not use a decent quality regular canvas?Please make a bag like that. I will buy it and would be willing to pay more for it.This was otherwise a great man-purse, for a person extremely resistant to the idea of wearing a side bag. But with a disability, these are very convenient, and this was the best designed by far, even when compared to more expensive and elaborate bags. Very utilitarian. Perfect size.Also maybe detachable straps?",
