Great for packing for the office for the day. Could also use for breastfeeding / nursing as a working mom. The color is good, has lots of pockets. Fits two bento trays with room to spare. I have overall very happy with this tote and just can not handle a stale food smell and this started in this tote from day one. I would still recommend due to the size and value for the money.",

The bottom of the lunch box is a bigger area and can fit my food containers (my old lunch box wasn't wide or long enough to hold standard sized tubberware). Then there is two sections on top that are insulated if you want to separate them out. On the sides, there are mesh pockets.The zippers are strong and do not catch along the material.To wash it- I just simply toss in the sink, rinse, and use a Clorox wipey. I leave it opened and upside down to air dry.",

The insulation is such good quality that it keeps things cold for hours, as it should. Having two separate compartments is very helpful. I like putting snacks in the section on top. It\u2019s easy to put the carrying strap on and easy to remove it. The bag spots cleans nicely. The material is very good quality, and it will last a long time with proper care. Lunch bags don\u2019t have to be ugly or boring to provide great quality and offer lots of useful features. This fun tote is proof of that. This is a great value, too, at this price point. Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "This thing is super functional and very spacious. I used it to pack myself a one-person picnic and there was much more room than I needed. I think it would be perfect for a two-person picnic. It seems unnecessarily large for a single person's daily lunchbox.Its design features make it versatile and easy to use. It has pockets for a water bottle/drink thermos on either side, a very large main compartment, and another expandable compartment on top, plus the front pockets. You can carry it in your hands with the short straps or over your shoulder with the long strap. Since I was hiking for a while, I found cross-body the easiest way to carry it, and it was actually quite comfortable to walk with for a long distance that way. I'm sure I'll get lots of use out of this practical little bag.",

The outer fabric and straps are nylon so it should last longer than polyester lunch bags. It\u2019s well made; the stitching Isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s neat enough for its purpose.It\u2019s much larger than I expected. I bring my lunch to work and stash it in the break room\u2019s shared refrigerator. This bag will fit but it takes up a lot of space. Depending on your menu, I think it could hold lunch for up to 4 people. It won\u2019t be commuting with me but I can use it as a picnic bag. Check the dimensions before ordering to determine if it suits your needs.",

I'm a nurse and I work 12+ hour shifts. My Coleman will usually be only slightly cool when I get home, this one is still ice cold and still some ice still in the ice packs. So the insulation is really good. It feels thick too.It's not as sturdy as my Coleman but this holds up though no issues.The red color is quite beautiful but not quite as bright as their pictures show. The handles and straps are nice and good quality. The water bottle pockets fit water and sodas well. And the top expansion storage is great. The front pocket holds quite a bit.",
