                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. || Short Answer ||A practical and mid-sized canvas duffel bag perfect for anyone as an over-night bag, or travel bag. Crafted with absolute perfection with ample space. Made from durable canvas and genuine leather. Excellent quality and designed with attention to detail and longevity.|| Long Answer ||It's very VERY difficult to find fault in any of S-Zone's products. Upon first glance and even after through and meticulous inspection - you'll discover quickly just how insanely beautiful and superior quality their bags truly are. Buy with ABSOLUTE confidence. This duffel bag is no exception.The Look/Feel: A very classic and distressed style duffel that is very appealing. The colour is true to the picture on the listing and the quality visually is very obvious once you have it in your hands. The canvas is soft to the touch, and the leather, supple.The Life: This bag is made primarily of a solid canvas with leather accents and durable hardware. The canvas itself feels very strong and firm to the touch, and feels like it will not wear out quickly. The bottom of the bag has 4 metal feet to prevent wear and tear when placing on the ground or during transport. It also has an even thicker piece of canvas on the very bottom anticipating lots of contact with the ground. The strap is also full canvas and feels strong. The inner compartments are beautifully lined with thicker satin material.The Quality: Superior. Material and seams all sewn to perfection. All connectors are durable and solid. The areas that need most attention like the very bottom of the bag, the straps, and sides have been designed with more durably anticipating much wear. The inner lining is also gorgeous and sewn very well. All hardware such as the zippers, snaps, and buckles are all strong and I do not foresee breakage.The Size: The actual size is: 21.7(L)*11.8(H)*10.2(W) inches. I would say this could do you well for a week away from home. It can definitely hold more than what it looks like. There are plenty of ample sized compartments on the inside and outside for many of your things - and most of them with full zip closures. The size can be changed by utilizing the clasps on the two outer edges of the bag, by simply clamping them to the bottom hooks. This will \"collapse\" the bag so it's more narrow, making it more suitable if you have less to carry. This option is awesome.The Practicality: This bag completely zips shut, which I love. The shoulder strap is fully detachable so this bag can be used a few ways, either held in hand or worn over the shoulder and cross-body. Like I already mentioned above, the bag can be converted into two sizes by utilizing the clasps and hooks on the sides. Although the listing says \"oversized\" - I rather call it perfect sized, because it's just right, making it suitable to use for more situations in your life.The Value: The asking price of this bag is $93.99. Just as long as the item will last me a long time, anything under $100 is absolutely reasonable.*sample provided for review.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very pretty weekender bag but I wouldn't suggest it as a carry-on. The leather detailing and buckles, although beautiful, must add some weight to it because my husband had a same sized duffel by Bugatti and we had similar items (and number of items) in our bags but his was significantly lighter. I ended up carrying his while running from point to point while he carried mine. Also, because it's not a structured shape, I don't suppose it would sit securely on top of a rolling suitcase (we didn't use ours on last trip, so I can't confirm).When I was using the strap across body, I did hop a bit to adjust the strap position around my hoodie and, even with the weight, the buckles didn't snap so it seems durable. It's a solid bag and I really do still LOVE it. It just didn't work for me as carry-on. It has plenty of pockets inside the main compartment and two zipped pockets on the outside. I don't regret buying this at all. It's perfect for weekend trips with the car.",
