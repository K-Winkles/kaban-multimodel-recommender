                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using a man bag for several years and find them indispensable. This one is an excellent design. Very functional, plenty of pockets, attractive and masculine, well made, and a great size for everyday life. The leather feels nice and the zippers are great.My two caveats would be that I prefer an actual leather strap \u2014 one that\u2019s not quite as wide as the strap that comes with this bag. Actual leather straps can cost as much or more than this bag, but I was able to find one on Amazon that met my preferences and (somewhat) my budget. So, that was a fairly easy \u201cfix.\u201d Fortunately, the strap that comes with this bag is removable (without scissors). Not all bags are made that way.The other small caveat is that the snap on the outside flap doesn\u2019t engage very well. I\u2019m hoping that was I break in the bag, the snap will more readily align and therefore not require a specific effort to close it each time. TBD. I will try to remember to update this in a few months.Overall, a great bag. Two thumbs up!",
