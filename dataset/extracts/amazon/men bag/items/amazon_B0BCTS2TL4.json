                "reviewText": "So I just received this bag and so I believe its a little early for an overall review. However, I do love this bag. It was actually bigger than I had originally thought, and that's a good thing. Everything fits perfectly with room for more, love the feel of the material of the bag. My only worry is the zippers. They seem like they could break in a short time. They dont have a full smooth opening as is, hoping some breaking in will change that. But given that I've had similar bags in the past, the other bags had higher quality zippers which sometimes makes all the difference.But overall I'm liking this bag. Will update the review after some time has gone by to document how it's held up as my EDC bag.",
