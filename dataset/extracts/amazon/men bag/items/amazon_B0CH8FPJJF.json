                "reviewText": "This is an excellent backpack for both teens and adults. The backpack is large with spacious compartments and offers numerous pockets for various items. The front lower pocket features 2 zippers and several pockets for smaller things such as pens, pencils, calculators, small notepads, etc, and features a removable keyring. the front upper pocket is small and features a single zipper and would fit a calculator or phone perfectly. The frontmost main pocket features two zippers and is a very large and spacious pocket that opens up very wide and features a separate, non-padded pouch in the back of the pocket.The rear main pocket features 2 zippers and opens up so far that the front of the backpack can lie on the floor while the back of the backpack is standing up. This pocket is designed for laptops and tablets and features 2 padded pockets and a mesh pouch. The larger padded pocket can easily fit a laptop. My 15\" Dell XPS laptop fits in the larger padded pocket with plenty of room to spare. The laptop pocket should easily fit a 17\" laptop. The smaller padded pocket can easily fit a large tablet with room to spare. The mesh pocket is a nice addition and is also large enough to fit a large tablet with room to spare. Both the padded pockets feature a velcro strap to keep laptops and tablets secure.The backpack straps are well-padded and one of the straps features a small zippered pouch for items such as a USB drive or similarly sized items. The back of the backpack features another pocket behind the padding worn against the wearer.The backpack also features a water bottle pouch on each side of the backpack, a hole with a rubber grommet for a headphone cord on the top of the backpack, and a USB-A female port on the backpack's left side. The USB cord inside the bag is a 24\" USB-A male plug for connecting a rechargeable battery pack. The backpack's handle features a rubber handle covering, which allows a user to gain a firm but comfortable grip. Each side of the backpack also features a small but deep zippered pocket. behind the water bottle pouches.Overall, this backpack is an excellent backpack for both teens and adults and seems like a very well-made and durable backpack. This backpack has the size, features, and quality that would compare to far more expensive backpacks.",

                "reviewText": "This backpack is perfect for weekend trips. It easily fit a pair of pants, a sweatshirt, socks, and underwear with room to spare. Additionally, the 180-degree zip-open function makes it a breeze to quickly get into the main compartment and grab whatever you need.The USB portable battery passthrough is a kind of neat function, but I didn't get a chance to test it. I also can't speak to just how waterproof this pack is, but based on the material, I'm sure it'd give you enough time to find a place indoors before rain seeps through it and potentially gets to whatever you have inside.",

                "reviewText": "Pulling the backpack out of the packing, I had cause to question the quality control. I don't think anyone told the new guy that you don't sew the plastic the emblems come in on the backpack along with the emblem. This was done twice. The second time, crookedly. Fortunately, close inspection proved the backpack well sewn. Even the strap with the crooked plastic. I noticed some areas have plastic or nylon that sounds like crinkled paper when moved. I didn't hear it when I loaded the backpack, so that will not be a problem.I pulled and tugged pretty hard on the stitching and saw no strain at the seams. So, I hope it will last as long as my dearly departed gray travel backpack (we were soulmates for years until it fell apart). I like the number of pockets and especially the key ring. I'll never lose my keys somewhere in the backpack again... I hope. I prefer more oversized side pockets to fit the bigger water bottles. But I do like the computer pockets. I always travel with a laptop and tablet. This is the first backpack I've seen that securely holds both. Of course, durability is always a test of time, but this bag is sturdy enough to handle travel rigors. For $36, if it lasts a year, you'll have your money's worth.",
