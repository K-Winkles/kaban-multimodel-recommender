                "reviewText": "I have a soft backpack for carrying clothes for travel. It packs like a suitcase and is great for clothes, but shoes and electronics do not pack well for extended stays. I wanted something that would allow me to carry a single pair of shoes and all my electronic stuff, including a 13\" laptop.After a couple of airplane trips, I am really happy with this bag. It carries everything that I do not want to put in the backpack or does not fit very well. It is small enough that I can stuff it under the seat on a plane, and access whatever I need during the flight. There are pockets for documents and wallets and stuff to go through security. A supplied bag holds a pair of shoes to keep them separate from other things. The bag has handle straps for carrying in one hand, and a strap for carrying over the shoulder. I have used both. I am not a fan of shoulder straps, but for this bag I was glad to have the strap for long treks through the airport.Calculated volume is 20L. I tried another bag with a calculated volume of 22L. It was okay, but a tad too long for under-seat stowage and not really tall enough for my laptop. This bag is perfect. It won't work for a laptop larger than 13\", but that is what I have and what I travel with, so it works well for me.This a great companion for my backpack \"suitcase\". Backpack in the overhead, this bag under the seat. Just what I was looking for.",
