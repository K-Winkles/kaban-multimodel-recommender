                "reviewText": "I think of this bag as an essentials bag. As a guy, sometimes I have a bit more stuff to carry after stuffing my pockets, so for me, this is an excellent option.The bag has 6 zippered pockets (wow!), and many more internal pockets which allows me to organize my stuff.In the very front is a pouch with a zipper whose tab can be concealed, and in the very back is a small pocket sized enough to carry a passport! This is super safe for travel. There is even a zippered pouch in the adjustable shoulder strap, amazing!In the middle there is a larger section with holders for pens, and small things. Towards the rear is the largest section with an internal zipper pocket, room for a mini-tablet, a mobile phone and a phone power bank. A cable inside connects to your battery and provides a USB port on the outside of the bag. There is also an opening to connect a wired headphone to a phone or media player inside. There is enough room inside for a small water bottle, pack-able wind breaker, keys, etc.This black bag is pretty sleek looking, for both guys and gals. The exterior is waterproof. The jet black zips are almost chrome-like in appearance and the adjustable completes the overall package!In conclusion, this is a cool bag and I'll be using it a lot!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. A \u201cmanly\u201d (5th degree Judo black belt) friend of mine recently started using a sling bag (we humorously call it a \u201cman-purse\u201d) and it caught my attention in a good way. So when I spotted the VGOCO Black Sling / Crossbody Bag it seemed timely to try it out.After periodically wearing it for ~2 weeks here are my impressions:* The #1 feature I love is the multitude of pockets, both zipper protected (7) and open (9) = a total of 16, both large, medium & small.* Having said that, in my video I point out the #1 feature I dislike: Only one (1) of those zippered pockets has double zipper pulls (see Pic #1). Since a key feature of this bag is to be able to switch the chest strap so the bag hangs left or right, it would be nice if (at least) all 4 of the front zippered pockets could be easily accessed while the bag is across one\u2019s chest. As it is, when wearing the bag over the right shoulder, access to 3 of those zippers is clumsy at best.* Pic #2 shows my iPhone 13 Pro Max tucked into the front pocket. What appears to be the top of that pocket (encircled in yellow) - IS NOT pocket. The top of the pocket is pretty much even with the zipper. Arguably one\u2019s phone should be the MOST accessible item in this pack; if VGOCO increased the height of that front pocket by maybe 3/4\u201d the phone would fit so the zipper could be closed. As it is, the few times I\u2019ve put my $1,000 phone in that front pocket it has slipped out. Not good!* Having done a fairly thorough analysis of the sling bag\u2019s quality, e.g., hardware sturdiness, seam structure, water resistant padded material, I must say I\u2019m impressed.* I\u2019m including Pic #3 to point out the \u201cHand strap\u201d which is a quick grab-n-go feature I\u2019ve enjoyed.",

                "reviewText": "My husband and daughter go to amusement parks a few times a month, and the Fanny pack just wasn\u2019t up to the task, so I found this for them. It\u2019s such a good bag, that I kinda want to order another for me! It\u2019s a perfect size. Fit their phones, sunscreen, personal fans, a water bottle, medicine and cooling towels. It has a few zipper pockets, and another on the inside of the strap. My favorite thing is the uSB charger that is on the bag. Genius!!!",
