I can fit a large tupperware container, ice pack, piece of fruit and a few other items at the same time. The outer pocket is nice for snacks. If I had designed it, I would have put a strip of velcro on the outside pocket for added security, It was a great buy for the price.",

Even the mesh on the side where water bottles go has no rips or tears. The bag keep food hot or cold and can fit a hard lunch box, thermos, bag of chips/snacks, and an ice pack with plenty of room left.",

I wanted a bag that was cute, lightweight, large enough to hold a few items, easy to clean, and kept my food/beverages cold. This bag meets 4 out of my 5 requirements. The number one thing was to keep my items cold and that\u2019s something this lunch bag definitely lacks, even with a large ice pack. I had one small sprite, one yogurt, a cheese stick, and a carrots in the bag. It sat for around 4 hours before I opened it. Nothing was cold. Unfortunately I\u2019ll be looking for another lunch bag because I really need my food/bev to stay cold. Otherwise, the bag is perfect.",
