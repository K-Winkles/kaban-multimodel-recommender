It\u2019s a little bigger than what I need, but it squishes downs easily. I will use it as my personal item on a plane as my purse, tablet, snacks, toiletries, pillow and other items I want at my seat will easily fit inside. It will squish under the seat in front of me but would take up all the room under there if the bag is full.I had ordered 2 of these bags from different brands, this was the better quality one. The color matches what was shown online, the material seems soft and sturdy and not crunchy. The other brand which was a slightly cheaper price had crunchy plastic material that seemed super cheap.There are lots of pockets inside. There are 2 pockets outside, one is a pocket sleeve to slide over the handle of a roller bag to ride on top.I just wish it had a shoulder pad for if the bag is heavier, I may make my own.",

The only thing that I can criticize is it is advertised with two drink pockets on the sides. The pockets are there, complete with drawstring tighteners, but the pocket does not expand to the length of the drawstring. You can, if the bag is not stuffed full, insert a small water bottle, a 20 oz soft drink or a skinny canned energy drink in them, but nothing very large. In any case, the small pockets are big enough to drop your keys in or any smaller objects that you want to get to quickly so they are still very useful. I like this bag.",

                "reviewText": "Mine came in solid condition. Maybe one or two frayed threads but nothing problematic.I dig the orange interior. The bag is soft and loose though so weight and size distribution within the bag will affect how things fit in some of the other pockets a lot quicker than a traditional bag or one with more rigid textiles.The front quick access section is nice and sort of convenient. I wear my bag sort of sagging so I\u2019m a bit trepidatious when putting stuff in there because if not secure they will fall out.The side drink slots are great for extra utility storage like small tripods or gimbals. Primary reason I chose this bag.Back \u201csecret\u201d pocket is slim but sort of an essential for bags IMO.The USB slot is just a loose cable fitted into a small zipper that has the interior of plastic port that leads out of the back. So you could theoretically swap it with any kind of cables you want to come out of your bag. Headphones, multiple chargers. Though there is no interior pocket positioned to hold a power bank. So you\u2019d need a longer cable for inside the bag depending on where you place the bank.Loop on the strap for sunglasses that never seemed to work with my shades. But it\u2019s there should you have use for it.The strap itself can clip to either side and feels sturdy enough.I\u2019ve been using this for a couple of months. I wish it had interior zipper pockets. Outside of that it meets all the essential functions you\u2019d want out of a bag this size. It fits a good amount of stuff.If this has been sitting in your cart, i would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This small backpack has become an essential part of my day trips, thanks to its solid design and versatility.You have several storage options: the main compartment with a divider, two smaller zipped pockets, and the side pockets which are great for storing water (I find one bottle is best, as two adds more weight and makes it more awkward to wear). I have carried two pairs of glasses, hand sanitizer, a pack of hand wipes, coins, wireless headphones, travel-sized sunblock, a granola bar, and a water bottle, all at once without any trouble. The convenience is great for how little bulk it adds! The size may also allow you to enter places that otherwise prohibit backpacks, such as certain sports venues and museums.In terms of materials and build quality, it is surprisingly great. The strap is reasonably comfortable, with enough padding to alleviate some pressure when the bag is filled up. By nature, a bag of this type will always feel a bit different since the weight is not distributed across two straps.The zippers glide smoothly, which I did not expect for a cheap bag. The inner and outer materials have held up well after about ten uses. The inner divider is a bit flimsy, but doesn't really bother me. I have found that one of the metal components on the lower part of the strap sometimes gives me an annoying pinch/poke, but I don't know if others have this issue. Overall, it's well-made for the price.I have not tested its performance in strong weather, with my experience limited to a light drizzle at most.For travelers and active people who need to shed size but still carry a decent amount of items, this small bag delivers big value for $20.",
