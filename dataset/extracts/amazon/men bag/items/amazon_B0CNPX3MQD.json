As a fight attendant I try to keep all my electronics (work tablet, kindle, chargers, ect) separate from my personal items like lotions and perfumes because I definitely do not want to deal with a leak! This is the perfect size bag that is easily stowed within arms reach on the plane and still fits all of my desired and required duty items! The quality is good for the price and I love that it has a wider flat bottom and extra zipper pouch on the side! This bag is very versatile in its uses\u2014 definitely recommend to anyone in the market for a small toiletry/travel bag!",

                "reviewText": "The pictures of this item on Amazon are a bit misleading, and will give you the impression that you're getting something a bit more substantial than the actual product. The actual bag you'll receive is fairly thin and slight, with basic fabrics, basic stitching, and basic zippers. There's nothing wrong with it, but if you're looking for a general purpose bag that you can repurpose for holding breakable electronics, or reference cards, or other day-to-day items, you're probably going to be a bit disappointed.For the stated purpose -- an enclosed space in which to pack a few small toiletry items -- it's fine. Neither the main pocket nor the side pocket are very big, so you're not going to be packing much. Pay very close attention to the dimensions, which are accurate so far as they go. The bag is only a bit more than 2\" wide and a bit over 5\" tall. If you're picturing a standard size paperback book, then you're in the correct ballpark. If you're picturing anything bigger than that, stop. ;-)As I state above, the fabric is pretty thin all the way around and not padded at all and as usual for a bag like this, if you try to over-pack it, you're going to have zipper problems. The inner lining appears water-resistant but does not appear water-proof. Other than a few small toiletries, the main uses I could see for this would be for small school supplies to keep them together in a child's backpack, or for packing and keeping together power adapters, charging cables, and the like for a business-person's backpack or travel bag.Other than its functionality, the bag looks nice and the picture of the one I got (the red one) was color accurate, something between a dark pink and a maroon. All in all, a functional object as long as you keep its specs in mind.",
