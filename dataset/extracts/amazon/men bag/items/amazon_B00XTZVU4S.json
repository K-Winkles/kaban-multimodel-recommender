                "reviewText": "I was a little disappointed in the tactical design of this bag. The pistol compartment holds your firearm very loosely, not very secure. I was able to jostle it around and have it come partially out with little effort. (I have a compact 9mm) My pistol also moves around enough to where its position would make a quick draw impossible! There are 2 elastic bands to hold 2 magazines, However, they are too wide and the magazines fall down into the pocket, making them irretrievable.Having said the above, I decided to improve the bag by taking it to a shoe repair shop. I happen to have purchased the same brand bag in the next size up, (for taking walks with my wife and grandkids, it holds a lot more \u201cstuff\u201d), this larger bag came with an actual holster that has Velcro on it as well as in the pistol compartment, keeping it very secure and readily accessible. . Since I will never use both bags at once, I decided to try the holster in this, smaller bag. It fits perfectly in the pistol compartment, but lacks the Velcro to keep it in place, so I had the shoe repair shop sew in a strip of Velcro, just like the larger bag has. I also made them stitch up the 2 magazine bands, making them tighter, (to keep the mags secure), they charged me $20., Now the bag is great, my firearm is secure, and so are the magazines.Bag is made of good material, zippers were stiff at first. The size is perfect for a compact or sub compact pistol, 2 mags, wallet, keys, cell phone etc.. and inside the largest, center compartment, you may be able to fit a very small tablet or a bottle of water..All in, it cost me about $37. I could\u2019ve returned it but I like the size and it\u2019s pretty comfortable to wear. I only recommend this bag for conceal carry if you modify it to carry a firearm securely! But if you don\u2019t plan on carrying a firearm, then it\u2019s a good little bag at a very reasonable price.",

He also uses it for his job, so he straps it, and the steps are adjustable, and they fit him well after he fixes it to size.he has worn it forward and towards the back, and it looks good both ways, i thought it may look bulky, but quite the contrary.I'm glad I purchased this sand my husband is very happy with his item.",
