The power supply/cord fits in the lower right outside pocket, my USB hub fits in the top right outside pocket, and my external mouse, tablet shortcut remote, and drawing glove all fit together in the flap pocket. I can also add a sketchbook in the full-width zipper pocket, my Kindle in one of the inside pockets, and a spare charging cable or two without straining the zipper.The case itself is lightweight, with a sturdy shoulder strap that's long enough to carry cross-body if desired. The whole thing is compact enough to slide into an outer pocket of my airline carry-on bag, and can then be pulled out and tucked under the seat in front of me for in-flight use while the larger carry-on is in the overhead compartment.If you have a Surface Studio Laptop or comparable device and need a practical slim case, do recommend!",

My laptop (13 inch) fits perfect even with a neoprene sleeve I have.The cons, the pockets are uneven and look kind of cheap because of that. Not like pictured. I imagine I could have exchanged it, but I needed it for work. They still function and the bag is otherwise well built and padded. When I put my reeled cable in for my laptop, it is a bit bulgy but that isn\u2019t a deal breaker. I also keep my computer in a sleeve in this bag and I know if I didn\u2019t, it would be less bulky. This is perfect if your chargers all fit in the front pockets. The other con is I don\u2019t like Velcro and the long pocket is Velcro. It isn\u2019t a deal breaker. I put pens in there so I\u2019m not worried about things falling out. The inner pocket is very thin and tight but you can put your phone, keys, pens, and even a small folder in it. So it is roomy.",
