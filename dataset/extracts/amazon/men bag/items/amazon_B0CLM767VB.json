The bag looked just as it did in the picture when it arrived, which was reassuring.It's a straightforward, no-frills bag \u2013 nothing particularly special about its design, but it serves its purpose well. The nylon material makes it lightweight, which is a big plus for me as I prefer not to carry heavy bags. The adjustable strap provided a comfortable fit, whether I wore it over one shoulder or as a crossbody bag.One of the aspects I appreciate about this sling bag is its practicality. It's spacious enough to hold my phone, wallet, keys, and a few other small items, making it an ideal choice for quick errands or casual outings.",

The actual color is very similar to the pictures, which I am happy about. The size is perfect for her to hold a wallet, her phone and several snack items.The zippers on the bag are nice and slide well. The stitching is strong and there are no loose threads. The clasps work well and the strap slides easily to adjust the length. It feels like a nice quality product. I am happy with this bag",

I wanted a color/design that both of us would be comfortable wearing. I like the location of the straps as a true cross-body bag and not a repurposed fanny pack.I also thought this bag was the perfect size. I've seen some really small ones that fig just a phone and maybe some cards/cash, or really big ones but this one is a really nice size. It fits the phone but can also fit snacks, etc... without being too big.",
