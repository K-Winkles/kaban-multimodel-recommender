                "reviewText": "SUMMARY \u2013 Great little bag, especially at a $20 price point. There's nothing fancy here, but solid workmanship, quality materials, and lots of pockets make this bag a clear winner!QUALITY \u2013 I've just received my bag, so can't speak to how it will hold up. That said, the construction and materials feel top notch. The canvas, straps, lining, zippers, and furnishings all feel sturdy and high quality. The fit and finish of the bag appears high quality and gives the impression the bag will stand the test of time.DETAILS \u2013 I bought this bag for two very specific purposes and will be carrying it with another laptop bag. Unfortunately, my main bag is too fancy to carry my water bottle and too slim to carry lots of paperwork. * The side pocket here is just big enough to carry my 0.7L CamelBak bottle (roughly 2.5\" in diameter). The fit is snug, but not so snug that sliding in or out is a hassle. However, the elastic opening closes up enough that putting the bottle in takes a second hand to hold the pocket open. Between the elastic closure and the depth of this pocket (about 5.5\"), there's no danger of my bottle falling out. * The inside compartment just barely holds a couple of thick letter-sized folders, although they do bend just a bit at the top corner where the bag narrows slightly. I think for most folks this compartment will be plenty spacious, but I was specifically concerned about file folders and notebooks. * There are plenty of other pockets, although they're all a bit generic. One or two of the inner pockets have a divider, but most of the pockets are just there for your stuff. This setup ensures maximum flexibility, but could be a frustration for those of you who like lots of individuals nooks and crannies. Your stuff may end up swimming around in there.STYLE \u2013 The price is a steal for what you get, which got me thinking about the two broad ways manufacturers keep costs down. One, sadly, is to use the cheapest possible materials and workmanship. The alternative, is to use quality materials and avoid unnecessary, stylistic frills. This bag very much feels like the latter. As a whole, the bag has a utilitarian vibe. It's not exactly un-stylish, but style wasn't what they were going for.",

It's made from canvas and is really comfortable after adjustment. Lots of pockets and 1 is hidden in the back so it can't be seen while worn. Perfect place to put your cash or phone to thwart pickpockets. Zippers seem really sturdy and the inside is big enough for a couple changes of clothes or enough supplies for a day hike.",

This bag was bought for my husband, he loves it. He's 51 so its great at any age. It holds our wallets, snacks and water bottles fine. It has lots of compartments so you can store multiple kinds of things in there while you are riding. We love it and it totally worked how we needed it to for our needs.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great sling bag, only thing I would change is the pocket on the back that sits against your back needs to be bigger and not have a liner that comes out when you remove your item. I would suggest making that pocket the same size as the bag with longer zipper. Also if a secure zipper could be used ot a clip type zipper for that back pocket would be great. That would help if you truly wanted a secure place for a small tablet.",

My 13.3 inch laptop is 12.24 inches long on the side that would go vertically in the bag, which is less than 13 inches. Once it's in the bag, the bag won't zip. It may stretch to be 13 inches at the tallest bit, but that isn't what the listing says.Luckily, my wife liked it, and it has now been added to her rotation of purses, otherwise it would have been returned.",
