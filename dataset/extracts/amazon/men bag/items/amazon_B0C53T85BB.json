Storage compartments come in handy and the price is attractive.The item itself is also not the worst to look at and is rather neutral in design. This bag is has a very light weight and is easy to carry.Cona:The fabric is fairly weak and the bag does not offer much structural support to keep its shape. There is no bottom insert or reinforced edges to keep the shape propped, which may be a concern if you are planning to keep this as your primary gym bag.I had brought this item with the intention of keeping it within my vehicle's trunk, but I feel it wouldn't hold up over time if the bag were to slide around during transport.I will be returning this item due to the lack of sturdiness. You can definitely make this item work if you need something on a budget, though.",
