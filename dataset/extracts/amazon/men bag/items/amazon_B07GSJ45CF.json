I won\u2019t use the shoe compartment so it\u2019s useless and I filled it with a weight belt, various wraps, etc, but it\u2019s not in the way of anything. The big side mesh part stretches a little more than I\u2019d like, but it\u2019s a 5-star rating. The two other segmented mesh pockets are great for cell phones and small things like chap stick or bar snacks. It\u2019s holding together very well. I got the color pink it\u2019s a great color. I would buy it again.",

I like leaving it in the car with our gym equipment so we can work out when the mood hits around our work schedule. Pockets for headphones, gym lock, as well as a separate shoe area and wet clothing area. This would be great for swimmers! A little big for the gym lockers but we squish it in ok. I like the color!",

It fits a spare change of clothes, shoes, flip flops for the pool, a towel, snacks, a smaller water bottle, shower kit, and toiletries. It fits in a locker with plenty of room for everything I need to stay while I'm working out, without being excessively bulky.The body feels durable and the construction is perfect, as far as I can tell. The bag itself feels very comfortable to carry either by the handle or the shoulder strap. The main pocket opens up enough to make everything very accessible, and the shoe pouch is conveniently located on the side.I really love the drab green color. Still colorful, but not gaudy or flashy.The only problem I have with it is that the trim for the handle gets stuck to the velcro and has already started stranding after just a couple weeks.Still, definitely recommend, great deal for the price!",

                "reviewText": "The 20\" bag is an excellent bag for the money. As others have noted, the zippers are slightly janky at times--meaning that you have to work a bit to get them around corners. Also, the shoulder strap tends to twist under the pad. However, the bag is extremely well-designed and functional for my needs. I like the compactness and it fits easily in a standard locker. The separate shoe and wet pockets are great and there is still plenty of room in the main pocket for gym clothes. Those who need lots of space for equipment might need a bigger bag, but for carrying around gym and swim clothes, it is perfect. I also like the two outside pockets for small storage (like goggles) and the inner hanging zip pocket for storing phones, watches, etc. there is also a clip for keys. Feature-wise, it is hard to think of anything else I might want in a gym bag. At under $30, it is well worth the money.",

So far, I like everything about it, including: number and placement of compartments, size of main compartment, shoe \"bag\", color, sturdiness, . . . There's a place for everything! Two caveats for older/shorter users: the bag itself is a bit heavy (I couldn't find a weight given in the description, but it isn't lightweight), and the shoulder strap needs to be all the way collapsed and the shoulder pad pushed to the end for me to use it and not have it bump around my knees. But I'll let those go for the convenience it provides. Plus it's really cute. I've had several compliments. A huge upgrade from the elderly IKEA bag I was using!",

I have seen several comments saying people found their bottles didn't stay securely in place, but suspect it is all to do with the size and weight of the containers you are using. It would be impossible to cater for every drinks bottle on the market. I especially love the waterproof plastic pouch in the bottom. I'm not a swimmer, so don't need to carry wet swimwear, but I do use a face flannel and shower cap, both of which would make the contents of my sponge bag wet; so I put them in the pouch until I get home and can take them out. I'm pleased I bought this bag.",
