I really like it because it holds my wallet, cell phone, pack of tissue, lip balm, readers, air canister, treats. The front of the bag has a magnetic closure & I store the tissue, treats, doggie bags & canister - items I can get quickly and ones that are not expensive. It also has a slanted small zippered pocket in front of the bag where I keep more doggie bags. Has a zipper closure around entire bag. Inside it, I store my cell phone, car key, lip balm & other small items. Right behind this is another zipper where I store my wallet & anything else that is important (check, etc.) All of this in a small, lightweight, compact bag! I do not carry a very large wallet. It has a nice wide sturdy adjustable strap. It is perfect for me because I often go to a store or other errand so I have my wallet available. I also often change bags when I'm going somewhere without my dog and it is easy to do with this little gem. In addition to all of this, the company gives you \"Return Me\" steel identification tag that has a \"reward for return written on the other side with an i.d.# and 800 number - you get this if you give a review of the product with the Peak Gear company. It is attached to one of those iron clad wire cords where both ends are screwed to each other. What more can you ask? P.S. I never leave my pooch in the vehicle in the summer.",

                "reviewText": "I was headed to Universal Studios and wanted a small sling pack that could hold my wallet, cellphone, sunglasses, sunblock...and a few other small items. This bag was very comfortable, had a perfect inside zip pocket that allowed me to ditch my big wallet and safely carry my ID, a credit card and a little cash. It has a nice sleek look. The quality also seems good, as I was pulling it on and off and shoving it in lockers so I could get on rides and it still looks brand new. I do a lot of travelling and am excited to take my new little bag with me! The ONLY suggestion I would have for Peak, should they do any design changes, would be to make the strap have the ability to break down so it can be turned into a fanny pack. I understand this may increase the price, but my little sister had a bag by Vera Bradly that had a removable strap extender...so when I had to put my bag in a locker to get on a ride, she was able to remove the extender strap, and wear it as a fanny pack, which was allowed. Plus, when traveling, I just think it would be nice to have the option. Sometimes the sling strap on a big chest looks a little funny, so rocking the fanny pack would be a nice option...lol. This bag is really terrific and it is refreshing to not pay a fortune for something of such quality!",

I will still use the first one for travel, but wanted a new one for city use.Very good structure and just the right size for me. Very well made.",

                "reviewText": "I bought and returned two.The design allows it to rest comfortably and controllably (either shoulder) and, most importantly, discreetly.. If not over loaded, it fit under my jacket.Let me back up, I bought this to safely carry passports, cash, wallet, phone and maybe a very small camera in places known for pick pockets. worked like a charm for that. Materials and stitching seemed well done.HOWEVER, the \"magnetic catch\" on the first one I bought popped off the first day I wore it. I returned and bought another.I wore that one for a week in some fairly sketchy places and felt totally secure. Used it for a trip where somebody in my party lost $450 in cash and his credit cards from his front pocket on same walk.But I got home and noticed that the \"magnetic catch\" sewing was well on it's way to coming undone. The magnet is a cheap solution which is a surprise since the rest of the pack, materials, sewing, zippers are all above average quality. Velcro? Snap rings? Anything but that darn magnet.So again, this bag is not a camera bag but a descrete valuables carry that's comfortable for hours, goes right or left easily and nearly invisible if you're into basic back wear. It won't really take even a small camera (Sony A6600 with a small 50mm lens) unless it's tiny (Sony RX100 maybe). Nice collection of pockets on the outside (change? flash cards? ), inside (map, snacks?) and deep zippered inside (passport, cards and other super important stuff).So there you are, I bought two, loved them and returned both.",

I'm rather hefty, 115kg, and at its longest the strap fits me rather well. So it will fit some bigger folks. It's planned use is cycling. Going to hold my tools and spare tubes and stuff, rather than load it on the bike. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a small pack to hold essentials or replace a purse.",
