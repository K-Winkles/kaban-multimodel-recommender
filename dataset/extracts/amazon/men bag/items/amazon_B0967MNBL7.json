It has enough different sections/compartments in different sizes to hold different things. Half size, closest to body, I carried some charging cables, the next was thin full size compartment where I carried some documents and my wallet, next is thicker full size compartment where I carried bottles of water, selfie stick, and the next is another thin full size compartment where I carried some tickets and the last, outer most is half size compartment where I carried couple of battery banks and tic tac candy.I did hit rain one day and inside was fine.One thing that bothered me a bit was that there's this metal ring outside which one of the zipper metal kept hitting and was making this ting-ting-ting sound as I walked which I later fixed by wrapping the metal part with some scotch tape.Overall, I loved it and survived all the European pick-pocketters.",
