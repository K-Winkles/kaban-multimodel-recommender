                "reviewText": "This bag looks pretty good. It was actually complemented a few times and I was told it looks like our was more expensive. I'm a boxer and I have to stuff two pairs of gloves, some wraps, boxing shoes and a foul protector into this bag. I do mean stuffed and there is not much room for anything else. If you want a nicely sized bag, this isn't it. It has plenty of compartments to fit things like mouth pieces, ropes and deodorant. The netting over one of the holes started to tear but that is priobably my fault. I think this bag will last be about a year until I have to find something else. I would recommend as long as you're sure about what your getting, and don't want to fit a bunch of things in it",
