                "reviewText": "Phenomenal bag! Got it and put it to immediate use. I'm a guy, so I get some one-off looks carrying around a bag like this in the midwest, but I also got two compliments on it. Sure, the english on the front is a bit janky and doesn't make sense, but it's incredibly well built. Zippers are sturdy, the buckles are actual bronze\\copper, not cheap plastic, and the leather feels great. Holds a full sized iPad air, which is great.The side-mesh holds a 6\" phone, or a thin bottle of water, but I personally think it's great for my phone. The pocket with the snap on it is a bit small for most things, but it does fit my utility knife nicely, which keeps it in close grasp.There are four main pouches on this bag:1. The main pouch is the one that you can access after unbuckling and flipping the flap up. Fairly large, holds a full sized iPad (10.5\") without issue, as well as whatever else will fit. Also fits a full-sized 5\" revolver with holster, with room for more.2. The second pouch is a zipper behind the main pouch, which is a bit narrow, but has the same depth as the main pouch.3. Third pouch is a zipper unit as well, and fits my keys\\smaller tablet (Kindle 6\") and random things like my wallet or work ID.4. Fourth pouch is simply an open pocket on the front of third pouch, and it's good for keeping smaller things like candy\\redbull\\wallet\\ID in as well.When it arrived, I was concerned over the size of the strap, but it expanded nicely, and fits my frame (6'1\") without issue, and slings down nicely over my hip.Over-all, for the price, this bag has a great style and is absolutely functional.",

                "reviewText": "I truly like this bag, this purse, this man-bag, this murse, this whatever. Materials and build quality so far (a week or so of daily use into my ownership) seem solid. It looks great and holds everything that I need it to. Currently mine contains, wallet (I love having my pockets empty!), sunglasses, prescription glasses in a hard-case, Galaxy Tab 3 (in the zippered pocket), house keys, car keys, LED flashlight, Leatherman multi-tool, large Swiss Army Knife, and an assortment of miscellaneous items like contacts, Square reader, flash drive, pen, cigarettes (don't judge), lighter, etc...The main compartment is fantastic in its capacity and small zippered pocket (where my wallet lives). The larger zippered pocket outside the main compartment fits my Galaxy Tab 3; even with the ginormous Otter Box case, there is room to spare. The smaller pocket outside of that holds a pack of cigarettes, business cards, random slim/smallish stuff.The reason why I have only rated it 4 stars, is the size of the external pockets. They are far too small and I've had to be creative to make them practical. The mesh pockets appear to be made for water bottles, coffee mugs, whatever... Standard sized mugs or water bottles will not fit. In fact, the mesh pockets are so small and tight that the sunglasses that I store in one of them are an extremely tight fit and getting them into and out of the pocket is a two-handed exercise that's still a bit of a struggle. The other mesh pocket, I'm using to hold a small LED flashlight and car key. Again, the mouth is so narrow and tight that getting my semi-largish fingers inside of it is not as convenient as I'd like.Additionally, the small utility pocket next to the main compartment is likewise disappointingly small. Currently I have the Leatherman multi-tool and the Swiss Army Knife in this pocket, as I can't think of any other practical use for it.Overall, GREAT bag!",
