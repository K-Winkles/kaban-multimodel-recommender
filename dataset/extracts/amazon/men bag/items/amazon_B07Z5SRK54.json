The inside liner is a bit flimsy, and one of the interior zippers was half broken, but I zipped it closed and open and it seems fine now.The shoulder strap is RIDICULOUSLY long and the same color as the bag. I love that. I have an executive size Rocketbook - can never remember if it's a core or the other one, but it fits in easily. My journal fits in a secret pocket under the front flap. The pockets are fantastic. Not super tight like some other bags. Easy to get into, which means I will actually use them. Lots of room for pens, which is good. The side pockets? Yeah. Kinda pointless. I might use the one with a flap for my earbuds. I'll need to be confident they won't fall out. I stuck a pen in the open pocket on the other side. That's fine.There are two main pockets, both plenty roomy. I plan to carry my lunch in one of them. I bought this because I started using my lunch bag as a purse, which was stupid. This seems like a better option :-) I like the leather pulls. It's pretty. Usually I get army green or khaki. This is definitely cuter. And at $20? A bargain.",

                "reviewText": "I have had a lot of purses. They always end up getting messy and I have to dump them out and reorganize every week or two. I bought maybe six purses advertising lots of storage options to compare them and eliminate the dreaded purse reorganizing. This bag won by a landslide and the others went back. Many other similar products have lots of storage but it\u2019s not all useable space due to the size and depth of the pockets/zippered components. This bag has the best storage of any purse I\u2019ve ever owned by far. It has enough pockets and zippered sections to keep me organized, but not so many it\u2019s annoying or I can\u2019t find what I need without looking in six places. I no longer have to reorganize my purse. Ever. I have had three and used them over a two year period heavily, the only wear any show is the rubber gripper on the handle of one bag split in the middl after heavy use. No fraying, no holes, no broken zippers, no seams coming undone. Lightweight but stores so much you won\u2019t believe it. Intuitive design that just makes sense. Super reasonable price. And quality construction, you can tell it\u2019s well made and will hold up. I will use this bag forever.Update: this is still the best bag.",

                "reviewText": "Being a man who crams a lot of crap into his pockets who got sick of bulging sides, I wondered one day why it must be that women are fortunate enough to be culturally accepted in carrying a bag around with their essentials while men are ridiculed for doing the same. I mean, who actually accepts men carrying purses around, right? Seinfeld had a whole episode about this, the \"European Carry-All\" episode which is sort of where I got the idea in the first place. I went looking and found that there are indeed a number of \"men purse\" products, which it does help to not actually CALL it a purse, but rather like this one, a \"mini messenger bag\" or any of the several other names I've seen. Whatever. It also helps to get one that looks more like a bag that men might carry.I personally have no concern for fashion, no sense of fashion or style, and wouldn't care at all what the hell the thing looks like for the most part, but I do still prefer to avoid the sneering and silly remarks that might happen if the bag I'm carrying is perceived as being too similar to typical women's purses. This bag looked just about perfect in that it could very well be something one would carry on a camping outing or might just be a big lunch box or perhaps something to put a tablet and one's pile of cords and chargers into. Nobody really knows what's in it.In my case, the several convenient pockets allow me to carry my small umbrella, my medication box, wallet, keys, pack of tissues, spare chargers, some small tools, a couple of pens and a notepad, etc. That is, all the stuff I might just happen to need. I no longer have to cram my pockets full and then still have to leave behind half of the stuff I wish I could have with me.The only real downside to this bag is that the long strap is completely built into the bag. It also has the really nice short carrying handle on top so that I can carry it that way when I prefer, and sometimes I do use the shoulder strap, but if I prefer to carry by the short handle, I'd rather detach the long strap and stick it in the bag rather than have that thing hanging down nearly to the ground. Some quick release hooks would have been preferable for me over sewing the strap to the bag permanently. I'm tempted to cut the strap off and make my own strap hooks. If they would design the bag this way, it would be a 5.",
