The material is great and sturdy, the wet pocket is a great addition and my size 11.5M shoes fit perfect in the shoe compartment. Exactly what I was looking for!",

                "reviewText": "I love this bag. It is amazing. Its perfect size and is just what I needed it for. I started a new job and they have a gym facility on-site. So, I needed some type of bag to take so I can shower and change clothes before starting work. This bag was the perfect buy. I can store my shoes, size 11 -mens, in the side compartment. With still plenty of room for my change of clothes and shower bag. It fits perfectly in the lockers where I store it while I am working out. It feels really light when carrying across my shoulder which is great as well. Some bags can cause some pressure on the top shoulder near the clavicle which becomes painful over time. Not this bag. This bag has proven to be nothing but shoulder comfort. Thank you for making such a great product. And the price is amazing! Why pay for a name on a bag that is more than likely not ergonomical to carry around when you can pay for a better product that is? I am only using it for the gym. If thats all you plan on using it for then this is the perfect product that I would highly recommend.Thanks.",
