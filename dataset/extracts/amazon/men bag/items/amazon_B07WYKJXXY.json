                "reviewText": "Black(upgrade Fabric Gold Metal Zipper)Large Fanny Pack(4 Zipper Pockets)Okay! So I've been on the HUNT for an amazing belt bag, which I found to be no easy feat. I ordered and returned so many others, but this one took the cake. I took this bag with me while I traveled to Australia and New Zealand, wearing it on the front while I traveled with a travel pack on the back. I wore it during the day pretty much every day for 3 weeks while we were out and about. It wears nicely as a cross body on the front or back, also as a fanny pack around the waist. I don't normally review things, but I was so impressed, I just had to.I KNOW because it's black, it's really hard to tell what type of material this is. The fabric is soft, a little slick (maybe like a shiny/silky nylon?), doesn't get dirty easily, easy to clean or brush off. The pockets provide for so much organization within the small bag. The zippers were high quality and I had no issues whatsoever. I use the bag \"hidden\" pocket (plastic zipper on this one) closest to your body for my passport, boarding pass for flights and my cell phone. The larger compartment also has a small pocket with plastic zipper on the inside, which is perfect for hiding away small items you don't need to access often like a pony tail, bandaids, tissue, etc. The front small zipper pouch was perfect for chapstick, eyeglass cloth, etc. The two main zippers on the front were a nice gold color and metal. The straps are great quality, soft, and easy to adjust. Both sides of the strap adjust and the end that would have a \"tail\" has a perfect elastic strap to hold the tail against the belt and also has reflective material on it that elastic strap. The straps adjust down pretty small and then back out pretty wide. I never had an issue getting them adjusted to the length I needed.Highly highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a guy who is always on the go, and I just got to the point where each morning it's a pain in the backside to always load up my wallet, keys (having keyless ignition in my car, I need to hang onto the keys), two phones (one for work, one personal), work badge, and other little tidbits that I carry with me each morning as I head out to work. There are days that I forget one item or another, and when I don't, my pockets are full. So, I finally thought maybe there is some kind of little bag that I can put all that stuff in one place, throw over cross-chest in the morning, have it lay relatively flat so it's out of the way (and I can wear a jacket over it without bulk) and just do my thing and go without worrying if I forgot anything (plus not have pockets full of schtuff).I have a cross-body bag that I use for travelling, but it's a bit too big (and if filled with too much stuff, it weighs it down and in-turn eventually slides down underarm turning into more of a 'murse' (no thanks)).This little bag works great! It lays mostly flat, doesn't have any flaps or anything odd... just straight zippers. It's not that big, but nicely holds everything. I don't carry much, so it doesn't get heavy and therefore stays nicely cross-chest. I can throw a jacket over it all and no one knows it's there (which makes for a great security bag to hold valuables close and concealed). It's pretty seamless to wear once situated.I looked at tactical bags (which are nice), but couldn't find anything just small, simple, and minimal... this basic bag fit the need. This works... and for under $10, it works well.",

                "reviewText": "This unit is exactly as specified in the ad and appears to be well made. The material is a typical woven nylon fabric. The color is a very attractive wine red. The strap was more than long enough and I'm a large man with a large waste. The zippers are unbranded, but seem to work smoothly. There are multiple pockets inside and outside. The sewn on label \"MAXTOP\" is at least a combination of English words and not some odd and unpronounceable Chinese word.The only minor design flaw is the way the flap covers the main zipper. The flap isn't long enough to stay down to cover the zipper and is sewn on in such a way that it easily randomly flips up exposing the zipper. Most people wouldn't care. If you are a very particular person, this may drive you nuts.",
