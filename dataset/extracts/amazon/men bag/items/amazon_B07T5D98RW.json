We're minimalists when it comes to taking things to the park, this had plenty of room for our needs and I carried things for our companions as well. The front cell phone pouch was perfect for quick, easy access to my phone. There was room for two cell phones, and we probably could have fit another. The bottle holders on the side hold a standard 16oz bottle. It was also small enough that we were allowed through security without extra search. The whole pack easily fit in the spaces provided on the rides. It was very simple to switch shoulders and resize for someone else to wear. I look forward to using this pack more in the future for hiking.The only con, and this is more personal, is that my back got pretty warm under the pack, but it was tolerable. (And to be fair, we were in the Florida heat.) The liner against my back and shoulder got sweaty, but washed easily.",

                "reviewText": "Based off of multiple positive recommendations from various Disney blogs and discussion boards, I bought this for my trip to Disneyland. It was truly the perfect size, with just enough storage to hold everything I needed it to hold. I did lose one water bottle that fell out of the bottle holder while I was tucking the pack into the storage pocket on a ride. Fortunately, it was a disposable bottle, not my refillable one. I have also taken it with me on several hiking trips as my day pack. It's very nice, because you can easily slip it on and off. With a quick change of the clips, you can switch which shoulder it's on. You can wear it across your front or your back. It's sturdy and keeps the contents inside dry in the rain or on a wet ride at a park. The blue color is as shown, and it's very attractive. I highly recommend this pack, and that is from someone who also owns other day packs from Osprey and Camelback. Obviously, those packs are for different uses, but for just a short excursion away from your vehicle or a day around Disneyland, this is great!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Comfy, Great Fit, Has Some Issues",
                "reviewText": "Edit to add: I never really appreciated how comfortable this bag was until I had to replace it and chose to go with something different. Even though this bag has some issues - see below - it is easily the most comfortable crossbody pack I have ever tried (and I have tried many!)I am 5' 7\", around 115lbs, and have narrow shoulders and chronic upper back pain. I'd never really noticed that this thing has padding in the spots that make contact with my shoulder and my back until now. Plus, something about how the weight is distributed with this bag just works well for me. So, yeah. I'll probably end up ordering a new one after all. Maybe I can, like, add super glue to the seams around the phone pouch and replace that clip before it breaks next time.Update October 15 2023: They fixed the zipper on the phone pouch but the pouch still fell apart. The plastic clip is also still a problem. (See pics.)I have now purchased this bag 3 times, most recently in December 2022. This is something I've never done with any other bag or purse, but I really like this one and it's nearly perfect for hiking with my dog and general everyday use. (I ditched my purse and started just using this bag for everything a while ago!)On the most recent bag, I was impressed that they had reinforced the zipper on the cell phone pouch. That zipper had broken on my previous two bags and other reviewers had reported the same issue. This newly reinforced zipper hasn't broken on me yet.However, one of the fabric edges at the bottom of the phone pouch started separating at the seam only a few weeks after I got it and has only gotten worse with time. I've still been using the thing, lol, but at this point it's close to being too big to keep my phone from falling out.Now, if I had applied fabric glue or fray check or even just super glue when it first started I probably could have prevented it from getting any worse and it would have looked good as new, but I just never had the time to mess with it. (Plus, I would've had to use a different bag for at least a day while it dried and I honestly couldn't be bothered.)In addition, a few days ago the plastic clip that clips the strap onto the bag - the thing that makes it repositionable from one side to the other - popped apart. (The same thing happened on my previous bag as well.) I snapped it back in, but it's happened a few more times since then with increasing frequency. Finally, a few days ago it popped apart again on a hike, dumping my bag onto a muddy trail in the middle of a rain storm, so I finally gave in an ordered a different bag. :(Previous review:I bought this in Feb. 2021 to use for daily 3-5mi hikes with my dog. It was so comfy and convenient that it ended up replacing my purse as well, becoming the only bag I've carried until now (July 2022).I love the convenient phone pocket on the strap, the multiple pockets inside the main compartment, the capacity, and the fact that I can switch the strap from left shoulder to right shoulder. I especially love that it has two water bottle pockets on the sides of the bag that easily fit average sized water bottles, allowing me to carry enough water for myself and for my dog in the summer.There are also multiple places to attach a carabiner clip or S-biner to in order to carry a folding water bowl and a poop bag holder for the pup. To top it all off, the strap is wide enough and comfortable enough to make carrying the bag for long distances a breeze.Unfortunately, about 6 weeks ago the cell phone pocket zipper broke. I've actually still been able to use the pocket by tying a broken hair elastic around the it, providing an elastic restraint to hold my Moto Stylus G5 in the pocket -- as long as I don't bend over, it stays put.But then, a few days ago, part of the strap clip popped out. It's a kind of plastic rod that inserts into a socket and allows the strap to spin around in any direction, making it possible to switch the strap from left shoulder to right shoulder. Anyway, I was able to snap it back in, but it has popped out a few more times since then, and each time the plastic piece that holds the socket together wears down a little more. So, unfortunately, I'll need to replace the whole bag very, VERY soon. (Like, now.)That said, other than those two issues, every other part of the bag has held up impressively well. None of the other zippers have broken and there are no tears or rips in any of the seams or fabric. Both water bottle holders are still intact, despite the mesh material. The bag still looks great as well. And I'm really not exaggerating when I say that I have beat the crap out of this thing.While I hate having to throw yet another mostly intact thing into the garbage (and from there into a landfill \u2639\ufe0f), for the price I paid for this bag and the amount of wear and tear it survived I think it was definitely worth the money. I'll also probably buy another one and hope that my next one holds up as well as this one did.",

It has lots of pockets for organizing. I have it packed with snacks, sunscreen, sunglasses, wallet and keys, and a large water bottle. I use the open pocket in the front for my 24oz water bottle, and I loop the strap through the bottle handle to keep it from falling out on a ride. The gray color goes with every outfit and doesn\u2019t hold the heat. It\u2019s also well made and I think it will hold up for a long time. Awesome bag!",

All the other sling backpacks that I was looking at were black or dark blue.I travled to Tokyo a few weeks ago and took this along with a small suitcase, as this trip to Tokyo was going to be a short trip. This sling backpack held a lot of items. I had my iPad mini 6th gen, a foldable keyboard, passport, keys, eyeglass case, wallet, some snack crackers. Total weight it has held was 2.6kg/5.73 pounds. Very rugged and still kept a low profile with all that in the backpack. I had no problem moving it around to say be under my arm, or riding in front or in back the shoulder strap is well padded and was comfortable to wear for hours on end. I recommend you get this brand of sling backpack, even if you don't get the orange color. Great choice for the money and will use it more in general use around the USA.",

                "reviewText": "I bought two, one for my wife in Teal and mine in Dark Blue. We both carry a lot of stuff around by default on long walks, bike rides and even shopping. We needed something smallish, easy to carry and of good quality. Having read the reviews on these bags we bought them, at a great price too, and they are excellent!Strap can be clipped to either side of the bag so you can choose the shoulder you'll wear the bag on. Great compartmentalisation within and outside of the bag. Definitely quality in construction. I go everywhere with this bag. Quick access zip on the outer part of the bag and where the top clips together is another pocket to put in documents, books etc. This bag has it all.Money well spent!",
