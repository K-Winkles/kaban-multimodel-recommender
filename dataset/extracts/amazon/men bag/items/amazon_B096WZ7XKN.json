I don't feel that I'm wearing it when I'm shopping. It is very comfortable and easy to clean. I love the different color selections also. There are many compartments, and all seem necessary for items I would normally put in my pocketbook. It's nice to have this cross bag versus a shoulder pocketbook so I'm completely happy with this purchase. AND the price is very reasonable!",

                "reviewText": "My kid is in elementary school and has an epipen set, inhaler, and inhaler chamber. These need to be with him at all times, and they often bike to a friends house. This is perfect- it fits all 3 devices. There\u2019s a little room for a small ice pack for hot summer days, to keep the epipen optimal temp. My kid is very skinny (kids size 8 slim), but the strap is adjustable, and at its smallest setting, it fits around the waist. However, it adjusts to fit me (adult large) with wiggle room.I did cut the excess strap off and melted the end prevent fraying. Doing this, I realized the strap is a good thickness- could cut it with heavy duty scissors but is nice and thick, too. The pouches are also a good thickness. Not thick enough to be considered insulated, but thick enough to be sturdy. I\u2019m impressed.It has a headphones spot that we haven\u2019t tried, but it make a great runner\u2019s belt if you need a little bulk!",

                "reviewText": "Purchased last with initial order of 4 items in attempt to order nearly $100's per order, so not to sit around wating for 2 & 3 orders to be delivered (and serparetly at times). Also routinely purchase multiple items from amazon, ebay, best buy, target, walmart & other big box stores (depending on which store has best price for same or similar items). Thus, chose to order all the items I want from on of those store at a time, then wait for merchandise to be delivered before ordering from one of the other stores, so not to get mixed up about what I ordered from whom, and also not to have to sit around wating for items to arrives from 2, 3 & 4 different stores. Oh, as far as the fanny pack, unfortunately it arrived separate from the other 4 items I orderes anyway, I'm still wating for them as a matter of fact. Purchased it for every day use, so I can wear my expensive leather one on weekends & special occasions only, and it serves the purpose. Purchased the (so called) upgraded one, has a decent amount of zippered pockets of stprage space, and seems farily durable. Overall satisfied customer",

                "reviewText": "I bought these in multiple colors because the first yellow one was more durable than any others I found. The material is slickish but sturdy, can easily clean.The zippers are hefty enough to take a lickin\u2019 and keep on tickin\u2019. They are like a good backpack with zippers in either black or matching. This one has the invisble style zippers which is nice to pair with blue outfits without black accents.Totally love the three pockets, thinner back pocket for phone/wallet/pen and small zipper pocket inside that.A thicke middle pocket for bulky items (keys, lotion, hand sanitizer, wallet, etc).A front small zipper pocket (band aids, gum, flossers, glasses cleaner, etc.)Strap is wider than most fanny packs and matches the color of zippers.Strap is adjustable to XXL (maybe bigger) and has a clip to hold the end that would otherwise hang down.These have replaced purses for me and I have at least a handful and want one in every color with every outfit!Have even worn professionally to avoid loosing anything, I strap it to me at all times!Only critique, wish there was a small space/loop for a carabeaner clip for my water bottle to hang because it is sturdy enough to hold it.",

I can squeeze in probably some other small items but wouldn't want it bursting at its seams.The zipper and materials are good quality. The zipper is relatively quiet when zipping it. I bought a slimmer and thinner passport bag after but that zipper is SO loud compared to this one. Comparing to only one other bag I have experience with this bag's zipper is really made of quality.I would recommend this product.",
