                "reviewText": "I am thoroughly impressed with this bag. After my previous one started falling apart, I decided to give this one a try, and it has exceeded my expectations. The build quality is excellent; both the bag and handles feel remarkably sturdy. The material, while on the thicker side for a gym bag, adds a bit of weight, but the aesthetics are fantastic, and the storage capacity is just what I needed.I managed to fit my size 12 tennis shoes (which usually take up a lot of room), a pickleball set with two paddles and four balls, my table tennis racket, a spare change of clothes, and even my 16-inch laptop. The inclusion of a dedicated pocket for the laptop was a pleasant surprise that I didn't anticipate when ordering, making it a versatile choice for short trips or even replacing my suitcase for certain travels.However, my only concern is with the shoulder strap. While the metal clips that attach to the bag are sturdy, the material of the strap itself feels a bit thin. It doesn't provide the robust feel I would prefer, but only time will tell how well it holds up. Despite this, the overall functionality and style of the bag make it a standout choice for my needs.",

                "reviewText": "This bag weighs less than two pounds, yet I\u2019ll routinely carry 50 pounds in it. Which is a strain \u2026 for me, not the bag.My primary transportation is a bicycle, and she and I travel far. My secondary transportation is therefore Amtrak, because Amtrak is bike friendly. So bike friendly, the bicycle always rides at a lower fare than do I.But I have to strip the bike of everything she carries, which is a lot, before Amtrak will accept her. So before checking her in, I load what she was carrying into carry-on luggage, and I need that carry-on luggage to be as lightweight as feasible, so it doesn\u2019t add significantly to the bike\u2019s already heavy payload.Yes, the bike also has to carry the bags that will carry what\u2019s in her bags, plus her bags, when she\u2019s not carrying it all.And that\u2019s the main function this gym bag serves for me and the bike. It\u2019s one of two pieces of high-capacity yet lightweight luggage I fill with all the bike had been carrying, and then I carry it onto the train.As I said, this bag weighs less than two pounds, but as important to my peculiar application is that it folds flat when empty, the better to store in one of the bike\u2019s four large panniers until time again to board Amtrak.Sometimes, I\u2019ll pause a months-long bike journey to fly home and visit friends and family. On those occasions, I will leave the bike behind and load just what I\u2019ll need for that week or two into this gym bag. Although I won\u2019t load it with so much that it can\u2019t still squeeze into the airline\u2019s carry-on test box.All of which is to say, this bag is a great carry-on solution for both flights and train journeys.The lid to the bag\u2019s main compartment features a zippered wet pocket, and I have used it for wet swim trunks. The main compartment also has a padded \u201claptop\u201d pouch on one side that I\u2019ve used for storing the iPad/Keyboard combo on which I\u2019m typing this review. The other side of the main compartment has two zippered pockets for separating small items from whatever fills the main space.One end of the bag has a zippered shoe compartment, which I use for the hiking boots I take everywhere. The shoe compartment is ventilated, which is nice, because \u2026 hiking boots. That end also has a sturdy carry handle.I use the pouch on the other end for carrying two bike-style water bottles, and that pouch has a cinch cord to ensure the bottles stay put.One side of the bag has a long zippered compartment, which in turn houses three smaller zippered compartments.The other side of the bag has another long zippered compartment, but this one is lined with tough reflective foil for keeping contents cold or hot, as you require. I haven\u2019t used it for that purpose yet, but I\u2019ve no doubt it will work to retain temperature, if I need that function.Finally, outside of that zippered compartment is yet another long zippered pocket. This bag has a lot of zippered compartments!All external zippers are of the weather-resistant variety and zip open and closed easily. I wouldn\u2019t submerge this bag, because it\u2019s not designed to be a waterproof dry bag, but I also wouldn\u2019t worry about the contents getting wet when it\u2019s exposed to rain, as will often happen.The exterior material of this bag feels durable. I like the bag too much to stress test it to the point of failure, so the most I can offer is the subjective observation that, yes, it feels as tough as the stuff from which the bike\u2019s panniers are made.Hope this helps. Clear skies!",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice travel or gym bag. It's a good size for 3-5 days for travel, slotting in nicely between my very large duffle for week + trips and smaller bags for weekends or overnighters.I like bags with numerous compartments and this has a good number of them, which makes things easier and more organized either for travel or the gym. A wet compartment is always nice for the gym, as is the water bottle side pocket (s). I don't know how well the insulated section will work as insulation, but it's a nice touch even if it just slows down warming.It comes with a full shoulder strap you can detach or attach, always niceThe zippers move smoothly without catching or sticking. The fabric seems well constructed. I let it sit under a \"light rain\" via our sink spray attachment, and water did not get inside. Not sure it will keep a downpour out over a few minutes, but also not sure why I'd be standing a downpour for more than five minutes, so I'm OK with that.I like the size, like the compartments, the build quality, and the water resistance. Very satisfied. If any durability issues, I'll update. If no update, you can assume it's holding up nicely",

                "reviewText": "This bag is not small. And as such, it may be for most people too big for the gym. It's pretty weighty as-is, so adding all your gym stuff is gonna make it heavier. But it does hold a lot. What I like best is the material that is water repellant, and also the exterior water bottle pocket. Pretty cool that it also has an interior padded laptop slot. No idea what a magic bottle pocket is. The insulated exterior cooler, plus hidden side pockets are cool. But for the cooler, I mean if you add an ice pack or a drink it's just gonna be tricky to use as it won\u2019t hold all that. Mainly because ALL the zippers coupled with the material means they must be carefully and slowly opened or they get hung up. The shoulder strap comes with generic metal clasps as opposed to more modern metal or even synthetic clips. Lastly, for travel, you'd typically want a side loop to put over your roller bag handle. This does not have it on the side. To note this came pretty crumpled up but it\u2019s smoothing out on its own.",
