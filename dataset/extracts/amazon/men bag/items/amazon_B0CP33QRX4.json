                "reviewText": "This is not a flimsy gym bag. It's exceptionally strong, well designed, and it provides a lot more utility than I expected.For example, the bottom of the bag has four hard plastic feet that keep the bag from sliding around on the seat or floor of your car. The bag's fabric is strong and resistant to abrasion so it won't easily get punctures or rips.One end of the bag zips open to reveal a \"tunnel\", or sleeve of nylon fabric that extends from one end of the bag to the other. This tunnel is a great place to store shoes or wet and soiled items. Also, the zippered end panel for this sleeve has two air vents installed.This is a large duffel bag so the main compartment will hold plenty of gear and clothing which makes this bag a good choice as a three-day or weekend bag. Further, a floor stiffener is included which will give the bag some shape and structure.And there are three additional zippered pockets around the outside of the bag, as well as a generous amount of molle.Overall, this duffle is large and it's very well designed and constructed.",
