The bag itself looks nice and has big zippers with string to help with ease of open and closing. Seems to be good quality and for the price you can't go wrong. Would recommend definitely.",

                "reviewText": "CANNOT SAY ENOUGH GREAT THINGS ABOUT THIS BAG!!! Tempted to buy more to stash away because it\u2019s become so ideal and irreplaceable to me!!! And I think it\u2019s IDEAL FOR ALMOST EVERYONE...MEN & MOMS DEFINATELY READ ON... It\u2019s compact, but has plenty of space to fit Etsy you need, with various compartments of different sizes and shapes all over the bag, inside and out) making it incredibly easy to carry and handle and allows you to find anything needed extremely fast. I never had a problem fitting everything I needed\u2026understand you\u2019re not going to be able to pack shopping bags or water bottles into it over the course of the day, but if you want to carry around the essentials and possibly a few extra things along the way, this is your bag. And I was able to clip a water bottle onto hardware with a carabiner with no issue some days. The construction is beautiful. The fabric and hardware is heavy duty. I know it is water resistant because I got caught in heavy thunderstorms and everything inside was dry and the outside wiped dry with just a paper towel instantly.I initially got it to take with me on an 8 day trip to Disney World. I was traveling with a toddler and wanted to be sure I had something compact for my own items so they weren\u2019t mixed up in a diaper bag or stroller. I still have not \u201cchanged out\u201c of this bag since I returned home two weeks ago! It has simplified and streamlined what I carry so much that I\u2019m not sure I will ever go back to carrying all of my extremely expensive designer handbags (much to my husband\u2019s chagrin)!!!If you\u2019re a MOM, you\u2019ll LOVE having your own space again!!! And if you\u2019re OUTDOORSY (which I am as well) you\u2019ll love the simplicity, accessibility and compact size that make carrying it all day, regardless of your activity, a snap. This bag could not be better!ALSO, I think it\u2019s ideal for MEN!!! It can allow them to carry more than they do in their pockets without having to carry a duffle/backpack/briefcase and they don\u2019t look like they\u2019re carrying a \u201cpurse\u201d. It\u2019s definately got an athletic, on the go look and feel...AND IS EASY ADJUSTED TO FIT ANY BODY (any height, weight, etc). My 6\u20195\u201d husband tried it on and it adjusted perfectly for him...he also liked it and kept offering to \u201ccarry it for me\u201d if I needed him to! Like any guy, he doesn\u2019t just offer that if he thinks he\u2019ll look ridiculous!!! He thought it was just as easy and convenient as I did... I think he\u2019ll appreciate having his own for our next vacation or just our next day trip.TRULY IDEAL!!! Just can\u2019t praise it enough and it\u2019s RARE I feel the need to rave about anything this much!FYI THIS IS A REAL REVIEW!!! Picked it out, paid full price and used it in real life without being asked!",

I have adopted this as a man purse. I need to carry many things for daily use, an EPI pen, urinary incontinence pads, wallet, car FOB, phone, coins, pen light, and when traveling, even more. This provides space for all that. It is easy to carry and secure. I gave it four stars instead of five because I had to invent a way to deal with extra strap of the shoulder strap. I used two Velcro straps to tie up the extra. Also the bag wants to always slide down so I find myself hanging onto the strap to prevent this. A thumb hole would be nice or perhaps rubber on the inside of the strap.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars The Budge Bag that Could Had Been More",
                "reviewText": "The Nicgid Sling bag offers a very compact and versatile way to free up your pockets during your daily life or when travelling. This review is specifically for the 14.5\u201d by 7.1\u201d version of this bag.PROS: Light weight EDC bag that can carry a variety of small items up to an iPad Mini.CONS: Bad strap management, annoying pull straps, not suited for bulky items.MATERIAL: (4 Stars) The bag is made of water and tear resistant nylon that provides positive protection against normal usage and mild elemental conditions. The material of the bag is sturdy and will hold up to being scuffled, tossed around, or exposed to light rain or snow. Although the zippers will do a decent job keeping the contents within the bag dry, it is not water proof and may not provide adequate protection against torrential down pours or heavy rain.COMFORT: (3.5 Stars) The bag is fairly comfortable to wear as long as bulky items are not involved. If bulky items are being stored, it will cause the bag to bulge and make the bag unwieldy. The straps, although unpadded, do provide a good amount of retention surface for the bag and it does help distribute the weight accordingly. However, depending on your body type and how the bag drapes over your torso, the strap may dig into or rub up against your neck.STRAP MANGEMENT: (2 Stars) One of the biggest issue with the bag is strap management. The bag has no real way to manage the extra strap slack without having to cut off the access material. As a result, the access strap ends up being tangled with your body or getting caught on something. The bag would benefit greatly if the company included some sort of elastic holder or a way to tuck the access strap into the bag itself.FUNCTIONALITY: (3 Stars) Overall, the bag will function as advertised. It is ideal for the minimalist who just want to store a few small every day carry (EDC) items without over-stuffing their pant pockets. The following are some items that can be stored in the bag:\u2022 Ideal items: Credit cards, money, passport, paper maps, iPhone, iPods, charging cables, pens/pencils, small notepad, thin power batteries, a travel pack of Wet Wipes, men\u2019s wallet, pocket flashlight, loose coins, flash drives, zippo lighter, and keys.\u2022 Hand-sized items: Sun glasses, Leatherman, pocket knife, small bottle of hand sanitizer, snack sized bag of peanuts, a granola or Cliff bar, hand gloves, beanie, hand held selfie sticks, and iPad Mini (with cover) or Kindle.\u2022 Not Recommended items: Small water bottles or cans, stand-alone mini cameras, scarves, heavy gloves, T-shirt, concealed carry pistol, or a trauma kit.DESIGN: (3 Stars) The design of the bag is pretty well thought out. It contains multiple exterior pockets, an interior pocket in the main compartment, and a secret pocket at the back of the bag. The external pockets can be assessable by both right and left handed users. However, the sections located in the main compartment and the secret pocket behind the bag are only easily assessable by right hand users only. This bag is not really user friendly for left handed people.Overall, this bag is ideal for everyday light or traveling usages when you only have a few items that are too big for your pockets and too small for a backpack. It\u2019s an ideal pack for minimalists, although its strap management leaves much to be desired.Total Star Rating: 3.1 (15.5 points of a possible 25)",
