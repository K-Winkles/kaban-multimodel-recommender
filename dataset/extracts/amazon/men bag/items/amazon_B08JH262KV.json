                "reviewText": "I'm very pleased with this backpack. I use it daily and it's been pretty durable. I don't stuff it, but it's got a lot of space. It has a laptop pocket which I love because I can keep it separate from the rest of the random things I carry. The zippered flap works well for my needs, too. The front zipper pocket is a good size; it's great for holding smaller items that I don't want to dig for. I appreciate the flap that covers it, so it's an added sense of security that it isn't so exposed while I'm on the go.The two side compartments for holding bottles or umbrellas are a standard size; I don't use them often, but they're pretty secure as well. I don't find a use for the external charging/connections but if that's your thing, they're very simple to set up and easy to access.One thing I didn't expect to like so much is that there's both a grab strap on the zipper flap and a traditional loop for a hook to hang from. They both kind of serve the same purpose, but it's nice to have options for different uses.Overall, I really like this backpack. It's stylish and mature, so it's great for me at work. I don't anticipate needing to replace it soon, but I'd definitely buy it again.",

This backpack has traveled with me overseas and all over the US. It has lasted me a good 3 years and is still in good condition. I was devastated when one side of the top handle ripped off, due to my own actions & stupidity.I immediately ran back here to purchase another one. I will continue to purchase again & again.

                "reviewText": "Pros:1.) Holds my 17\" laptop!2.) It held not only my 17\" laptop but also my 2 portable monitors that I use when traveling for work for more than a day or two.3.) Straps and carry are comfortable even when heavier than I prefer.4.) Seems sturdy5.) My coffee wiped right off when I accidentally spilled on it.6.) Thin enough to put under a compact baby stroller seat. (Though still a little bulky to get in and out easily or quickly)7.) Fits under an airplane seat.8.) Nice option to hold a spare battery and charge your phone from the side pocket9.) It has two places you could hang the bag from a hook. One on the top opening (which makes it easy to carry in one hand if needed and one on the top but back of the bag, which is much appreciated when trying to get something out of the bag while it's hanging up. This is especially appreciated when trying to change a baby in a public bathroom. You can use that back hook to hold the bag while getting out your diaper changing items.Cons:1.) The flap with 2 magnet latches on top of the zipped pocket is overkill and kind of annoying when trying to open one handed. It also adds to the previously mentioned struggle getting the bag in and out of tight spaces.2.) Because it's tall and thin, the interior main pocket only holds things that are also tall and thin or I guess just thin. Especially if you do have your laptop in the cushioned divider part. I was using this as a multi purpose travel work/diaper bag and although it worked out with some tetris style stacking, it's a bit of a pain having to take out everything on top if you need something from the bottom.3.) The straps are really really adjustable, which is great in some cases but would be nice to have a way to keep them from hanging SOOOO long. Like an elastic to hold up the extra strap would be a really nice addition.",

                "reviewText": "I am a teacher and needed a backpack to carry my computer and other things. I had several picked out and decided on this one based on size. It is a little tighter than I thought for all the things I need to carry but it will do for my computer, planner, grading, and some books I need to being home. I probably could fit 2 more 3-ring binders and it would be full. The front pouch handles my novels very well. I can fit about 3 in there. The inside has a pocket big enough for a phone and another smaller pocket to fit 1 pen. As a teacher I love my space for pens and this was not enough. There are 2 side pockets for drinks, etc.. I was able to fit my Yeti in there. The elastic stretches very nicely for larger drinks. The best part is the straps! They are nice and thick. They aren't super cushioned but are comfortable and don't hurt my shoulders or back.",
