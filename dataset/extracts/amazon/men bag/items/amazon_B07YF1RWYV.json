There\u2019s more than enough room for cords and peripherals, but it\u2019s still slim enough for under your seat for flights. The anti-theft features make it perfect for travel, or sending it to the library, or wherever else with peace of mind. It\u2019s been pretty durable & rugged so far as well, so top marks for size, durability, and anti-theft features, plus it it still keeps the laptop safe, snug, well cushioned, but it\u2019s not bulky at all and amazingly light weight considering all you get with this laptop bag. The price was quite low for what feels like a custom laptop bag, too, which was a nice bonus as well.",

It has held up really well and shows no signs of use. I'm pleasantly surprised about it's durability. The locking feature is excellent and I have used the included cable to lock it up. Happy traveler here.",
