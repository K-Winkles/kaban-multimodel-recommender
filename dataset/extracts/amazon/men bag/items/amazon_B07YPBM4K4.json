                "reviewText": "Bought this for my son to put his phone and money in whilst playing football out and about ( no pockets). The strap is a good length for crossbody (my son is 5ft 8) and it can be shortened to go around the waist. My son is happy with it. It\u2019s slimmer than some but perfect for what we wanted. Delivery fast.",
