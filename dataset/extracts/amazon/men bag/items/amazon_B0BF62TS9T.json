There are many pockets for such a small bag, and it seems like good quality, and I love the look of it. My iPhone X fits perfectly in the outer pocket too! The USB port is also cool, but I haven\u2019t tried it yet.The only thing I worry about is, the strap hurting my shoulder only being on one side the whole time. I might have to switch sides often. But, I guess I\u2019ll find out on my next hike lol.",

I\u2019ve owned it for 2 weeks. I\u2019m hoping I got a bad bag because I\u2019m ordering another and will update my review after I have the new bag.",
