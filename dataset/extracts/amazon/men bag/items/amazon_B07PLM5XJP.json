Yes it does max out on a strap size, but its fairly large when released all the way. My only issue is the cord and the external holding \"bracket\"/port. It is a very tight USB fit when plugging it in. It constantly gets pushed back into the bag from the holding bracket. Then you have to fiddle with it from the inside again. Minor inconvenience overall. I love it for all the extra crap I need to carry. My pockets are empty now. Highly recommend still.",

It isn't needed, but one wouldn't make the bag uncomfortable; yet were there one it could help person feel the vibration when phone on mute or low.Charging cable - no where does it say it is a highspeed charging cable; people need to read before buying and complaining. While it comes with a cable as stated, it isn't installed. You can put it in place easy enough, but if you pull cable cord in bag at an angle, it will come out of place. There are two holes (see pic) where it appears you could put something across the cable to hold in place, but I haven't looked into it further.",

The quick access \"clasp\" pocket is only practical if it is holding something large--small items would likely fall out. In hindsight, I wish the padding on the strap was adjustable but so far the sling is holding up to wear and tear and looks a little less dorky than a fanny pack.",
