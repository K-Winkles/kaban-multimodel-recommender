I\u2019m a mom and student and needed something that was easy to grab and put on, something durable, and something not too large but also not as small as a fanny pack. I needed it to hold my essentials\u2014wallet, phone, keys, airpods\u2014 as well as books (I never leave my house without one) and this bag delivers on all of that with room to spare. Im able to put one large book or a few smaller ones in the main pocket, my essentials in the front pocket, and any slim items (like my kindle) in the smaller back pocket. It\u2019s soooo easy to sling on and when I need my essentials I can easily slide it to the front of my body and unzip that front zipper to access them. The fabric is great, the bag is cute and stylish, and it\u2019s durable. Seriously, obsessed with this! Better than a fanny pack and a open purse where stuff just falls out or is easily accessed by littles. I have no qualms with this. It\u2019s perfect for my needs.If you\u2019re not like me with the books, you can easily fit a water bottle and other items.",

This bag has it all! I\u2019m also going to a wedding in NY in October so this will be perfect for traveling! \ud83e\ude77\ud83e\ude77 I am obsessed with this sling! It\u2019s pink, holds loads, is the perfect size, comfortable, secure and has an unique and sleek design! I also love how it has a handle and that little loop at the bottom, it\u2019s such a cute detail, I think it could hold your sweater but I\u2019m not completely sure. This bag can also hold a small water bottle. I definitely recommend! \ud83e\ude77\ud83e\ude77\ud83e\ude77 \ud83e\ude77 I\u2019m very picky when it comes to bags they have to be comfortable, hold a lot and have pockets! For a girly that is literally obsessed with bags I hate carrying them. After a while I just get tired of holding them and get uncomfortable. So this sling bag is definitely the perfect fit if you\u2019re like me. \ud83e\ude77",

                "reviewText": "My Fiance biught this bag for me off of my wishlist for my birthday sland I love it even more than I thought I would. The black is a true, dark black and it doesn't seem to fade like others can. The material is lightweight, durable and water resistant! I use it as a purse or a little day bag for trips. The shape and size are super convient. I don't even have to take it off to access my things inside... since it has only one strap you can just slide/spin it from your backside to your front. It has 2 large ipperwd compartments and I always seem to be able to fit everything I need in it and more. It is a bit bigger than I thought it was though.. it's longer than a subway sandwich, and definitely wider than one! \ud83d\ude02 it is so perfect, I would consider buying it in another color as well",

                "reviewText": "I bought this bag for a trip to Europe as I was afraid of being pickpocketed while traveling. Although it is pretty expensive compared to other crossbody bags, it's Northface, you're most likely paying for the name not the functionality. But this bag satisfies both, it is not only pretty large and can store many FLAT things, but it is also pretty sturdy and could probably withstand being pulled by a thief if it really came down to it. Keep in mind that this bag is in no way a normal bag. It is longer than it is wide, meaning it is meant to store flat thin things, not anything bulky unless you plan on carrying Rubik's cubes around. This does mean that you can carry your wallet, coins, cash, passports, and important documents which is what I used it for and it worked great, but once I put a normal sized water bottle in it, it couldn't hold it without looking odd and feeling off. So overall, this bag is good for carrying important things, not for usual backpack items, but it is an overall solid bag I would trust.",
