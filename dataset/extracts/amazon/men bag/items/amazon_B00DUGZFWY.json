The build quality is exceptional, providing robust protection for my laptop while ensuring easy portability.The spacious interior comfortably accommodates my 17.3-inch laptop, and the additional pockets are a fantastic feature for organizing accessories such as chargers, cables, and even a few documents. The durable zippers and well-padded compartments inspire confidence that my device is secure and shielded from any potential bumps or scratches.In terms of value for money, I got this when it was about $19. It makes sense the price increased, but it's not that much of an increase. It delivers functionality, durability, and style without breaking the bank. I highly recommend this laptop bag to anyone in need of a reliable and affordable solution for safeguarding their larger laptops while on the go.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a decent carrier for my (already protected) Samsung Galaxy S9 tablet, something that would include any needed extras (trackball, charger, etc) and ran across the Amazon Basics Shoulder Bag carrying case. The more I looked at it, the more I realized its value and capabilities. Bang for the buck, this unit is unbeatable. The material feels water resistant, very sturdy and should last a long time without getting ratty.It looks to be quite sturdy, has three pockets in the main compartment with more than enough room to keep my BT keyboard separate from my tablet and any other item of that size handy. The front has two zippered pockets-the front smaller one has enough room for 5\"X7\" items and has stylish reinforced stitching on both sides to avoid any tears. The larger pocket is absolutely spacious (9\"X11\") with a couple of straps for pens (or other stylus) and a couple smaller interior pouches that might fit a small BT mouse or other device. The shoulder strap is wide enough and padded so as not to dig into your shoulder and is more than strong enough to carry everything without issue. If just handles are all you need for carrying, these are plenty strong and comfortable and the shoulder strap is easily removed and stored.I would highly recommend this for anyone who needs a shoulder bag capable of carrying an 11\" or possibly even a 12+\" tablet or other device of that size. Once again, Amazon Basics strikes the right balance of price and value.",

                "reviewText": "The bag is decent enough for the price. It is certainly worth more than what it cost. The material is not the toughest, however it seems it should hold for at least a year, maybe more depending on your usage and how much abuse it receives. There are just enough pockets/compartments and space for your computer a notebook/pad, and just the bare essentials. The padded computer compartment is sufficient for CAREFUL use and carry; probably will not save the computer from damage if the bag were handled too roughly or dropped (especially if your laptop's case is plastic). However, this is all purely speculation and completely subjective, I have not performed any drop tests. Im simply basing that on a comparison to the padding in other bags I've owned or seen (typically of a higher quality and cost). The padding is limited to just the faces (top and bottom of the computer), there is no padding around the sides (outside edges). This leaves the corners of your laptop subject to damage by possibly catching the bag on something while carrying it (Getting a larger bag could reduce risk of damage to the corners). The compartments are pretty tight so dont expect to carry anything bulky. I could get my standard size mouse in there but it was bulging through the bag. I purchased the 14\" bag for a 14\" computer, and it was very tight; had to force the zipper to get it closed around the laptop. After a few uses, it loosened up a bit, not much but just enough to where I wasnt struggling. Still needed two hands to zip it closed though.I recommend getting the next size up bag from your laptop size. That will certainly help alleviate that issue. I would also recommend getting a folding mouse, as that will fit a lot nicer and without the bulging.Overall, it is worth the cost. But just recognize you arent paying for an expensive bag, so set expectations realistically.",

Screensize of our Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE is 12.4\". Dimensions with case are 7.5x11.4\". Happy to report the tablets and another smaller tablet both fit into individual pockets insde the 11.6\" bags. Plenty of room for other incidentals in a third pocket. There's also two zippered pockets on the outside: one large one and a smaller one perfect for a passport. These bags will work to easily remove devices when going through TSA at airports. We're pleased with the efficient size, quality, and price of these bags.",
