I also use it as an overnight bag when I spend the weekends at his house. It\u2019s large enough to store several days\u2019 worth of clothes and gym wear. If you plan to carry it around a lot, I recommend buying a smaller bag though because this bag is BIG. The material is water proof and the bag has a pocket on the outside to attach a water bottle. The pink is nice, but I wish they had these in more patterns. I would prefer something floral.",

                "reviewText": "I play broomball two to three times a month and used to keep all of my equipment in a regular hockey bag which was way too big. When somebody accidentally spilled an energy drink in my bag and got everything all sticky, I figured it was a good time for a new bag. After looking at several similar bags, I selected this Under Armour bag and am very happy with my choice.This bag fits two pairs of knee pads, my helmet, gloves, shoes, and two bags of miscellaneous equipment all nice and tidy in the main compartment. My old bag was about a foot wider and all of the equipment would slide all over the place in the extra space. One of the sides holds a t-shirt, pair of shorts, and pair of socks for after the game. The other side holds a pair of sandals and a few other miscellaneous items. The one feature I really like is the little key pouch on the top inside middle of the bag for keys. With my old bag I would just throw them in the main compartment or one of the sides and I'd always have to go fishing around for them after the game. Now I always know exactly where they are and can quickly get to them. There is another zippered compartment on the front which I don't even use, but is available to hold even more stuff.I like using the padded shoulder strap to carry the bag around so my hands are free, but I do use the traditional two handles periodically when moving the bag short distances. I like the standard black bag with logo on the side, but it is available in a ton of different color combinations to fit anybody's liking. The bag seems like it is well made and should last a long time.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Bag, perfect for all of kiddo's karate gear!!",
                "reviewText": "We love this bag!! It seems well made and like it will hold up for a long time, it is well sewn from thick durable materials, the zippers r perfect, and the strap seems well made and I am sure it will hold up unlike others (it even has a thicker rubber-ish material on one side-but not too hard that it's uncomfortable or anything)..we've had it for over a month now and it's been drug around by a 10yr old 2-3 days a wk for classes and still looks just as good as when we received it (as u can tell from pics, it still looks brand new and my kid isn't easy on it, he throws it around everywhere n everything)!! It fits everything we need with some room to spare- all his sparring gear (helmet, foot pads and hand pads) plus his 2nd gi for his jui jitsu class (which is quite large and a super thick material) that he does right after his karate class in the main large compartment (or a kitty with tons of space to spare lol), plus drinks (2 on outside of bag in the dual bottle holder pockets, plus xtra inside the bag), plus he can fit his shoes in the side shoe pocket when he takes them off, the front pocket holds his sweat band with room for other random smaller items, and there's even a small pocket inside the large main part of the bag that we use for his mouth guard (which would also b good for keys and maybe a phone depending on how large your phone is, but there's always that front pocket that is plenty big enough for phones n such too), there's also another zipper pocket on the side with the water bottle holders (that we currently don't even need to use, but I'm glad to have it, I was hoping that this bag didn't only have a zippered pocket on one side- the shoe side- and I couldn't tell from the listing and pics if the other side had a zippered pocket as well, since it had the bottle holders there- but it does, yay) so this bag really utilizes space well with pockets everywhere u need and want them to b, there's no wasted opportunities here!!...there's plenty of pockets and plenty of space for everything he needs and then some, we really could pack more stuff into it if we needed to, but it isn't sooo much extra space that it's too much ya know..it really is the perfect bag, I could see this bag being useful for so many things, and next time we take our yearly trip back home to FL for a cpl wks, we will be using this bag as his luggage for his stuff and I'm confident it will be the perfect size for holding all his things needed for the trip no problem (and I'll get to use that extra side pocket for sure, sweet)!!-The ONLY thing that might make this bag even better, is if it had a hard insert for the bottom (tho it DOES have a thicker PADDED bottom, so it is actually much thicker than the rest of the bag materials, so it not being a 'hard' bottom doesn't actually matter much, actually maybe this is better than the typical 'hard' bottom, cuz it does enable him to squeeze it into the cubbies at the dojo) either way I'm still super happy with this bag, that's just a small note to make..*If my review was helpful/informative for u, please hit the 'helpful' button below, thanks*",
