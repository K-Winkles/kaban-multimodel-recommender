This new bag has held up much better than the first one I received. I've been using it consistently for over a month now with no signs of the stitching failing. See below for the original 1 start review.The interior stitching on the inside where you place your shoes is subpar. It ripped only after 2 weeks of putting shoes in/out. This makes the shoe storage section useless as it opens it up to the rest of the interior storage. I was lazy and just got around to reviewing this and missed the return window by 2 days. The rest of the bag is decent but now I'll have to buy a separate bag to keep my shoes/wet clothes in. I'd spend the extra money on a name brand bag.",

Unfortunately, I located another spot near the skull where the colored material had a small tear and was beginning to flake off the bag itself. I\u2019m super bummed out because the idea looks awesome but the execution is terrible. Also, not sure why but it arrives with a terrible synthetic odor. Like a REALLY strong plastic/rubber type odor that has not gone away and it\u2019s been out for over 24hrs. Shame. This bag really could have been great.",

The bag is very durable and feels like a solid product. The compartments are easy to get to and the size is perfect. The shoe stash is great and I keep an extra pair in their just in case. Love taking this to the gym and I have had a few people stop me and go on Amazon for me to show them where it is. Great bag.",

                "reviewText": "Well I have not used the bag yet, so I am unable to provide it with 5 stars, or even a proper review when it comes to anything more than my initial impression. With that being said, there are a few things I enjoy about this bag that I find compelling to share. It has a shoe compartment, a feature I find critical to a gym bag. Seems to be large enough to hold a pair of clothes, shower materials, shoes, shaker bottle, and a snack. The material, although pleather, which does wear out and is honestly a terrible material in general, feels good when it\u2019s fresh. I don\u2019t care much for the logo or the name being written on the side of the bag, but I also won\u2019t take a star away from the review due to my own personal taste. The oversized zipper is ridiculous, it makes a ton of unnecessary noise and is somewhat pointless. However it is a good conversation piece, and you know you are not going to mistakenly zip up something in your bag, poking a hole into a Cotten shirt or something of this nature like you may with an overpacked back containing a smaller sized zipper.Pretty pleased so far but only time will tell the truth about this bag.",

It is way too big in my opinion and very cheap. I just use the buckels to hold the opening closed. The bag would be 10/10 for me with a nicer quality or at least smaller zipper.",

                "reviewText": "I have been looking for a a gym bag to replace my current one for long while. I\u2019ve looked online & gone to sporting stores but I was looking for something very specific. I was even ready to give up on the fabric design as long as I had the specs I wanted. This has everything. It\u2019s really aesthetically appealing for the gym (I got pink), 2 zipper pockets on the inside, a shoe compartment, sturdy fabric, pockets on the outside & a zipper bigger than I\u2019ve ever seen before that I never have to worry about getting stuck. All the straps are well secured also. Most of my complaints about the other bags is that the bottom didn\u2019t have any kind of padding or extra layer to it. This fabric is so thick & because this doubles as a backpack, the bottoms/back, has padding.I would say that my only complaint is that the straps attach way far on the sides causing the bag to collapse & fold in when you carry it on one shoulder but I still LOVE it. I never have used my gym bag for anything other than the gym but I will start using this as an overnight bag as well\u2026 or maybe buy another one. I wish they made more colors like a mint green. I\u2019d buy it today.UPDATE: Per my intial review, I was wrong about the straps being durable. My bag never weighs more than 15 pounds max and that is usually because of a pair of shoes and a water bottle and not even a big water bottle. I keep a pair of sweats, a towel, and then the small essentials (headphones, workout gloves, deodorant, gum, etc.). The straps started pulling apart from the bag so I tried using gorilla glue and that didn\u2019t work so then I used shoe repair cement and that helped a little bit as you can see it\u2019s still falling apart. And even though I don\u2019t have anything sharp or heavy in my bag, the side pocket seam ripped and because of the material I can\u2019t sew it. I\u2019m really disappointed in this bag. I wanted to love it. Now it is back to looking for another that\u2019s actually worth the money.",
