Previous backpack ripped on the straps due to the weight of carrying around all his books. This one has proven to hold up, makes contents in bag feel lighter, looks great, and is quite spacious. Also, accidently left backpack outside in the snow over the weekend. When found Monday morning all the papers inside were still dry and undamaged after receiving 5 inches of snow and almost completely covering and hiding the bag, I was impressed.",

                "reviewText": "I've had this backpack since 2019 and I've taken it to quite a few places. The first time I ordered it, the zippers immediately broke so I was sent a replacement, but I haven't had any issues since. The zippers, mesh, pockets, etc. all are running very smoothly, even though I'm a chronic over-stuffer.In the beginning of 2019, I packed this backpack and took it to Europe for about three months. It was my only luggage as I traveled cross-country via bus and plane, hostels and hotel rooms. Conclusion? This thing is HEFTY and can fit a lot of stuff.Over the years, I've used it as my carry-on luggage for what amounts to maybe 30-40 trips now, and I also use it for short local weeklong trips, too. When it's overstuffed, it's too big to fit below the seat, so I mostly used it as an upper bin bag. It's slammed along the bottom of over a dozen bus carriages, trekked through wet, humid, and dry conditions, and it still looks great. I'd say it's even stretched out a few inches over the years.Here are a few things you should know:- I wore this as I walked the misty, rainy streets of Edinburgh and the clothes inside remained dry.- I've had to run to catch planes in-between quick layovers, sweating as I raced to catch my plane, and the straps have excellent wicking capabilities, because it's never smelled.There is a clamshell backing compartment that opens completely flat which is great for electronics. For me, it fits all of this:-12.5\" Dell laptop-11\" MacBook with padded holder-A paperback book or 1-2 magazines- 8\" tablet readerI can also sometimes cram my laptop fan, but sometimes not, if I pack too many clothes.That compartment is about 2.5\" W x 17\"H closed. Frankly, it doesn't have a lot of give, so I try not to add additional items to that side.-There are two pockets in the side that have zippers, usually I add water bottles here, but you could also add shoes or dirty socks inside the zippered areas.-The largest compartment measures around 6.5\" W x 16\" H, though it has stretched out over the years.Here's a sample of clothes I can pack here when rolled them; rolled and wrapped a measuring tape around each piece of clothing to get the diameter, then measured the height (before I squish it all together):-1 pair of sweat pants 10\" x 4\"-1 sweater 9\" x 3.5\"-2 pairs of pants, one at 11\" x 4\" and 10\" x 3.5\"-1 sweater dress at 10\" x 6\"-1 pair of tights at 5\" x 3\"-1 sweater at 11\" x 6\"Then a packing cube with various undergarments (3 pairs of socks, 3 pairs of underwear) and two long-sleeved shirts at 11\" x 4.5\"-And that leaves an empty space for more at 7\" x 5\" I put a few pairs of socks and a Google Nest in, but it's still not packed snuggly.-Then there's an additional flap, where I usually add a small toiletry bag with soap, shampoo, toothbrush/toothpaste, etc.-There's another small clamshell pocket where you can put pens, and there's a key ring so your keys don't get lost inside your bag.-There's an additional zippered pocket where I put my passport and extra TSA locks.There are straps on each side that I've pre-measured out so that if I want, I can fit the bag under a domestic airline seat. With all of the above mentioned, there's room to spare for a few more things.Instead of adding toiletries to the end pockets, they would fit at the top of the pack and make it nice and snug. Enough clothes for 3-7 days, easily, depending on what you pack.-And to the handle, I'll usually wrap a scarf and neck pillow, or a jacket for the flight.And here are your caveats:-The more you pack those two deep pockets (clothes and electronics), the less space you'll have to pack anything else in the extra pockets.-If packing for underneath a seat, you can't have much in any of the other pockets or side mesh holders.-The bag is designed so you have to put some things in each of the two large compartments, you can't just fill up the larger one with clothes. It will gap and you'll find you're wasting space.-The straps are very thick and not particularly comfortable, especially when the bag is full, for a smaller frame like mine (5'3\").Recently, I'm entertaining the idea of switching out this backpack because of my own back lol. I need to downgrade to a rolling checked bag and get a smaller, lightweight backpack for my electronics since I WFH now and need to bring a bit more gear than I used to. But I continue to take this pack when I'm spending the night somewhere for a few days, and I would definitely consider taking it on a short trip if I didn't need to bring my work equipment.Maybe I'll come back in a couple of years and let you know how I'm using it at that time!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this backpack before embarking on a 2 year masters degree which requires me to travel across Europe every few months. I bought it bc I am not capable of packing lightly and wanted a big backpack w many pockets that I can shove full as a carry on- and it works perfectly for that.However I decided to write this review bc I recently moved to Bergen Norway. It rains every single day. This has also become my university backpack, although it\u2019s a bit big to just carry my laptop and water bottle and snacks.. but I don\u2019t have another one. Anyway, it holds up so well in the rain. Granted I haven\u2019t had it long, but my laptops and books and everything else stay dry inside even when the rain soaks through my jacket and sweater..There\u2019s no signs of wear yet and I\u2019ve used it daily for months. When I shove it full for travel, I REALLY shove it full, and no signs of wear from that either. When it\u2019s only carrying a few things, I like that I can cinch it up with side straps / clips so the empty pockets don\u2019t gape out and it makes the whole thing slimmer.Overall I\u2019m very impressed w the quality considering it\u2019s from Amazon and not some name brand, which would be much more expensive. Definitely recommend this backpack, it\u2019s a huge bargain but performs like any other high quality name brand backpack. Very happy with it.",

I got the smaller of the two sizes and, while it fits, putting my laptop in the bag requires some work. It'd be fine if I didn't put it in a sleeve, but that's not a risk I'm going to take. So, if you have a large laptop and a sleeve, make sure to measure things accurately. Regardless, it's a good bag. Handles seem sturdy and durable, there's a lot of nooks and crannies to put many things into, and it looks nice and simple. I'm able to divide my books and other items now, something I've never been able to do, and I can say that it's wonderful. Considering all this, I think the price is very fair. I recommend it if you're looking for a new bag.",
