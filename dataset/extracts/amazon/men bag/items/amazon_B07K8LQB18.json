                "reviewText": "This review is from a mans perspective. This is a GREAT BAG AT A GREAT PRICE! Excellent construction and professional packaging with a Thank You Card & Care Instructions! Can be used by men or women, small size but holds a lot!I had been looking for quite some times for a small messenger style bag with quickly accessible pockets to use as what is calles a \u201cPossibles Bag\u201d to use at the gun range for black powder muzzle loading. Most \u201cPossibles Bags\u201d are too small, for my needs, don\u2019t have pockets and are much more expensive.\u2022 This bag is perfect! Looks good. Great thought was put into its design, construction and organized compartments.\u2022 The front flap is a magnetic clasp (the buckle is fake but a great accent) and is great for quick access. It can also be folded over the back for complete access to all pockets.\u2022 The front has an open leather pocket where I can quickly access my ball starter and patches but also perfect for a cell phone.\u2022 Also on the outside under the flap is a large open compartment almost as large as the bag for many accessories.\u2022 The inside which has a zipper closure has 3 vertical pockets in different widths, a large zippered pocket and the main compartment. I did find the zipper stiff so used some bore butter (lubricant) and now it's smooth as butter! :-) You can use any good lubricant.\u2022 On the very back outside is a nice size zippered compartment great for my Samsung Note or other accessories.You will not be disappointed in this bag I know I\u2019m not! Very happy with the purchase and would buy again in a heartbeat! In fact, I am considering purchasing a 2nd one for trips and airline travel. I can now carry all my black powder muzzle loading accessories to the range in a compact, functional bag but it will fit anyone's needs! Outstanding!!! AAAAA+++++",

                "reviewText": "This is a fantastic, spacious, nice looking purse. I very specifically searched for murses (men\u2019s\u2019 purses) because I wanted something functional for work. Women\u2019s purses, like most products marketed to women, are sexist and useless. This bag exceeded my expectations.Our city has a lot of theft. It\u2019s small enough that I won\u2019t have to leave it with cashiers or get searched by security.It\u2019s large enough to hold my iPad, a small book, a loungefly wallet, my iPhone, keys, and snacks. My life revolves around these things.It\u2019s cute, but not feminine. I like looking cute, but I don\u2019t want to look girly. This is a respectable, functional, nice looking satchel for a professional human.The strap is better than expected. It\u2019s not cheap material, it\u2019s nice. It still might catch my sweaters. May have to replace it, but don\u2019t hate it.It reminds me of messenger bags I used to use as a teenager. It\u2019s like a mini version.Kind of love this bag. Might order a second one in another color or just a back up for when this one gives out. It\u2019s a keeper.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a small bag to carry a wallet, phone, with room enough for a tablet with a keyboard case, and this works perfectly. The cotton mesh strap is very thick and sturdy as well. I was concerned about ordering it out of worry that it would be thin -- it's not. It's good looking and comfortable to carry . When I don't have the tablet or a notebook in the bag (and the bag can bend) I can even wear it while wearing a seat belt in my car, yet it's still a very roomy messenger bag. I'm extremely pleased, and would buy it again.",

                "reviewText": "This product is well made.Its got a good shape which it holds and is of a thick material. When I seen this bag advertised as being made with leather, for the price I thought it was just a marketing ploy but its genuine leather which I do not know how I feel about, being an animal lover and all, and with todays Faux leathers being extremely well made, I don't know why real leather needs to be used at all.Its a decent size and holds my phone, wallet, keys, compact mirror, pencil case and binder (or interchangably my lunch and a drink as it cannot hold all of the things).however I will note with my A4 (standard for 8x11 paper) binder it will not fit in the bag if I have tabbed dividers in it.Without the tabbed dividers it fits but does stick out a bit and prevents me from zipping the bag or securing the flap, however this is a small thing which I am able to over look and still use the bag.Its for the reason above I deducted a star however this is a high quality bag for the price.PROS:- Good/High quality- Sturdy- Multiple pockets- Great for on the go people with minimal itemsCONS:- Does not hold a standard A4 binder when tabbed divivders are in use.I would reccomend this bag, however really take into account WHAT YOU ARE CARRYING BEFORE PURCHASE, this bag does not give room for error its true to measurements provided by the seller.",

                "reviewText": "I came back from a three week trip in Italy seeing a lot of locals (men & women) wear similar style unisex shoulder bags. I found this bag on Amazon; had good reviews so I decided to give it a go. I\u2019ve been using this bag every day for the past two months. It\u2019s a versatile bag I use it to go to work with wearing full business suit and for casual outings to the grocery store, social get together at restaurants and at friend\u2019s place. The quality is well put together. The stitching, materials used and lining are all well sewn together. The leather sewn in areas to strengthen the high use areas of the cross should bag are also well thought of. This should cross bag has enough compartments separated with zippers to allow me to carry a lot of my junk from pen, gum, wallet, sun glasses, head phones, extra rolled up t-shirt, socks to change in and out of for extra curricular activities if you don\u2019t feel like using a gym bag. The bag is a little heavier but it\u2019s not even a consideration point if you\u2019re like me that used a foldable small travel sized backpack or cross shoulder chest bag for the last 10 years for work and social engagements. Great value and price point. Five Stars!!",
