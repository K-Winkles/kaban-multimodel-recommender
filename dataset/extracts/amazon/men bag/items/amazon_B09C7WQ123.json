I ended up taking a hard flat plastic bottom piece from another duffle and put it in the bottom of this one to make it a bit sturdier, and that helped a lot.I like that it has a separate shoe compartment, although it could have been a bit bigger; my husbands size 12 shoes didn't quite fit, although I was able to squish 2 pair of my smaller sized shoes in there.I liked the variety of colors available and the bluish-green color I got looks nice. It's got lots of compartments for stowing all your stuff and a handy strap to hold it on your suitcase handle.",

                "reviewText": "Okay first the Pros: Great pricing, great foldability to be a potential space saver, really large pocket space & came with a smaller side bag.Now the Cons: Cheapest, Thinnest low quality material you\u2019ll ever get. The lining doesn\u2019t even seem like it\u2019ll last long. The \u201cshoe\u201d pocket arrived torn from the seams with a large hole (that only got larger when I put my shoes in). I had to double sew (using my own sewing machine) to reinforce the poorly sewn pocket. Most flimsy pocket design, 3 weeks of regular home to gym time and the pocket seams are now falling apart completely (at the top now).Overall: it\u2019s not great, it\u2019s not terrible either. I should\u2019ve bought a more durable bag for legitimate gym use rather than a bag made for overnighters. Would rate higher if my shoe pocket didn\u2019t arrive with a hole, and didn\u2019t destroy itself through normal usage in only a few weeks.",

Having a separate compartment for the shoes is just perfect since I don't soil my clothes with dirt and odors. The mini bag is just perfect to carry small accessories so you don't lose them in the large bag. The only negative is that the fabric is very light so the bag itself is very soft and barely hold itself. Seems look quite sturdy so it should last for a while. Not the best bag I had but a good bag for the price.",
