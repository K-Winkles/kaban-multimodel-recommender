I just love love love this product I've taken of traveling with me overseas it's strong the one I use at home I use for feeding my Feral cats colony can pack in so much stuff. The color did say the little on the green, but it was such a long wearing product. I didn't mind exciting but hoped it won't on this beautiful new yellow one.",

But this for my 10-year-old to take to and from volleyball practice and you can see in the picture that I had to tie the bag up just to make it manageable on size. Even as an adult I had to tie it up for myself. (I am 5\u20195\u201d) I love the water bottle pocket and the extra pocket on the front for extra storage",
