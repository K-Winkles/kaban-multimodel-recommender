The interior has an odd shape, so in one part of the bag it seems really wide, but once the bag is zipped up the rest of it becomes more more narrow as it goes towards the exterior or the front of the back.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Good Pack, but with Lots of Little Annoyances",
                "reviewText": "USB Port / Battery Pocket:\u2022 The battery bank pocket is situated in the center of the front side of the bag, when having it at the bottom of the back side of the bag would make more sense for weight distribution.\u2022 The USB port itself is awkwardly positioned as well. If it were situated towards the top of the bag instead of a third of the way up its side, it wouldn\u2019t be as much of an obstruction to the items you want to pack.\u2022 The USB cable is way too long. It only needs to be long enough to reach the battery pocket, but it\u2019s nearly twice the length of the bag, so you wind up with a bunch of unnecessary cable knotted up and jostling around with the rest of your belongings.\u2022 The thought of an externally accessible battery bank is a nice idea, but ultimately a pointless one. It\u2019s more stable to plug my phone into a battery that\u2019s in my pocket than it is to plug it into a bag that I\u2019m slinging around, and since you have to press an on button to use most battery banks, you still wind up having to rummage through the bag whenever you want to use your battery anyway. In all likelihood, I\u2019m just going to remove the USB from the bag so it won\u2019t be in the way, taking up valuable space and irritating me.Pack Opening:The positioning of the zipper is incredibly stupid. The bag is essentially designed like a box with its lid on the bottom. The zipper opens the back panel, so whenever you open the pack, you have to contend with the shoulder strap being attached to it and flopping around. If the zipper opened the front panel instead, the lid would just be an easily manageable flap of fabric.Gussets:As with the positioning of the zipper, the gussets make it awkward to open the bag. They\u2019re obviously there to improve water resistance, but if it were raining heavily enough for them to make any difference, you\u2019d already be past the point of needing a rain fly. All they really accomplish is limiting how far you can open the bag. I\u2019d much rather have the ability to fully open the bag than the meager protection those gussets provide, so just as with the USB port, I\u2019m going to wind up removing them.TSA Lock:No instructions for setting the lock code were included with the bag, which is monumentally obnoxious. To set the lock code\u2026.1. Set the number dials to the default code, 0-0-0.2. With a small implement such as a paper clip or a tooth pick, fully depress the small round button that is on top of the lock panel, next to the right zipper slot (you will hear a click).3. Set the number dials to your desired combination.4. Press the large rectangular button on the right side of the lock panel. The new code is now set.Summary: All in all, it\u2019s still a decent little day pack. It\u2019s just frustrating, because without all of its stupid design flaws, it COULD be a great one.",
