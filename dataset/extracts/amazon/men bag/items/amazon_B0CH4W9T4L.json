                "reviewText": "I'm not sure what happened, but the bag I got is terrible quality and looks nothing like the bag pictured. Bad dye job, esp on tbr straps, which are a weird blue color. Cheap fabric, cheap buckles, cheap straps. I would be embarrassed to give this as a gift and am returning it.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using this laptop bag for roughly two months now and can say its intended use hits all marks with flying colors.The bag is relatively lightweight and has multiple compartments to separate things if needed which is really nice but where it falls flat is in the build quality department. The fabrics, straps and overall textures look and feel quite tacky and use a cheap material.At the end of the day the bag does what it's intended for and that's lugging around your belongings which it does with flying colors. The thing most will notice is the quality of said bag that will be the make or break point. For me, I prefer functionality as opposed to looks!Hope this insight helps before you purchase!Cheers! :^)",
