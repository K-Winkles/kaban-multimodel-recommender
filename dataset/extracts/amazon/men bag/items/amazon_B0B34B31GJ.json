                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Our wake up call was standing at the customer service desk at Walmart reporting my husband\u2019s lost wallet. It fell out as he got into one of their electric carts. After losing his wallet, three times and having his phone fall out of his pocket all the time, my husband decided to try a man bag. This fit the Bill perfectly! It\u2019s not too big, the fabric is pliable so that as he\u2019s moving around, he doesn\u2019t notice that he has the bag on. It\u2019s very comfortable to wear. There is plenty of room in the pockets and each will hold quite a few items.He said there are two things he likes the most about it\u2026the top zipper pocket for easy access to his wallet, and the flap pocket on the front where he can put his phone and quickly get to it. Finally, no more scrambling to find his license or insurance card, or rummaging through the car to find a lost phone.He\u2019s a big guy with some mobility issues and often uses a cane or walker, knee, roller or wheelchair. We find that this gives him (both of us) security that his phone and wallet are safe. it may not sound like a big deal, but when you are maneuvering a person with mobility issues, you always have to stop and check to make sure that they haven\u2019t dropped anything.We would highly recommend this product!",

Quality overall lacks in certain areas, such as stitching and zipper tabs that will eventually unfurl through time and use. But it will serve its purpose to store whatever items you intend. Spacious main storage with additional front storage. I would only recommend to use as a light everyday carry and not for tradesman carry or heavy work tools carry. Design is efficient for everyday carry of light essential kit. Would recommend if you're looking for an affordable sling pack for light edc.",
