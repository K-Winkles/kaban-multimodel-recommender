                "reviewText": "Fits a 14\u201c slim laptop easily. I'm using it for a work bag - laptop, mouse, headset, a few notebooks, a personal 10\u201c tablet, and my lunch. It's got plenty of space and organization options and the USB port is a nice touch. My phone doesn't fit in the strap pocket but it's ridiculously large so I can't fault it for that. Easy to carry over a single shoulder when you're just going a short distance and don't want to wear it crossbody. Comfortable on either side, and doesn't shift around on a bike or motorcycle. The canvas is sturdy and the bag looks nice. The molle straps are useful and it's refreshing to find a bag with them that doesn't look like it escaped from a military surplus store. The only thing it doesn't have that I'd like is a buckle on the strap so it's easier to put on and take off without pulling it over your head, but that's really hard to find in a bag. It's stayed dry in light rain but I'm not sure it would in anything heavy.UPDATE: I've been using this bag as a work bag for a bit over a year now. There are a few pulled threads at the flap seam, probably from overloading it or my cat being a jerk, but the integrity of the seam is just fine. The bag still looks as good as it did when I got it, despite most of my commuting being on a motorcycle. Zippers are in great shape, internal pouches are undamaged, and my laptop has survived a few surprisingly hard landings in this bag with no damage. It's broken in nicely without feeling or looking worn. I carry a large water bottle in the side pocket daily and that's also still in great shape. No plans to replace this anytime soon.",

The strap at the top broke after a week. I could have used it longer, but I really wanted something more like this one. It's beefy, and roomy and can accommodate a large book and some smaller notebooks, headphones, etc. The zippers and other parts seem durable and well-made. It has a mesh side bag for a water bottle. (Not a large one, though.) I love it and recommend it. The value is very good.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a sling bag that could sit over my chest to use as my personal item in addition to my backpack. Not only did this perfectly serve my airline purposes, but it turned out to be the best travel day bag I've ever used. It has a lot of space and a lot of pockets, but was not big and bulky. This is a very durable product and I experienced no problems during our 10-day trip to Europe, where I relied on this bag heavily every day, both in the city and on the trail. I don't write reviews very often, but this bag deserved me spreading the word.",

                "reviewText": "The age of Covid has changed nearly everything about my job. Instead of going to a physical office building every day, I stroll down the hallway to my home office, motor up the standing desk, and get to work. This has dramatically changed the dynamic of what I carry around with me in my work backpack. Instead of carrying everything I \"think\" I might need for a day away from home, (ie: company laptop, personal tablet, power supplies, cables, adapters, other personal items, etc.), now I carry the essentials. Plus, as laptop sizes have slimmed down, (from a bulky, old HP 14\" down to a svelte, 12\" Surface Pro 7 and a personal iPad Pro 10.5), I need less bag to protect them.Then there's this. In the old days I was flying to and from Europe and fell into the habit of keeping most of my portable office on my back all the time. I'm talking about things like Bose headphones, spare batteries, and the like. Even though it added a few pounds to the heft of my bag, it also meant I never had to scrounge around at the last minute to pack for a long trip.As my previous daily bag, I have a Swiss Gear TSA-friendly pack that I purchased from Sam's Club. As far as I'm concerned, it remains the best value on the market. It's not perfect, but at $39.95 it's hard to beat. With the exception of the odd, internal, hard-shell sunglass case that always rips free at the seams, the Swiss Gear is a beast. I've traveled the world with it and it just... keeps... going. Sure, the teardrop design falls over at your feet at the airport, but it's large enough and flexible enough for me to carry all my electronics, a few flat file folders, and even an emergency change of clothes and shoes.But in the post-Covid, work-from-home world with smaller electronics and less travel, the Swiss Gear is overkill for most of my daily needs. Most days it just sits on the shelf collecting dust.So I went hunting. After several hours of hunting, I found this Nicgid (what's with these odd, word salad names, anyway?) sling/messenger bag and it seemed perfect for my needs.Okay, nearly perfect. It only lacks three things that would make it truly perfect, but I'll get to them in a minute. Those three things are so relatively minor that for most people they'll never notice the difference.First, let's talk about the great features...* It's a single-strap convertible, meaning you can carry it left or right shoulder, or reclip like a messenger bag, or carry by the handle like a briefcase. (Also a drawback, but we'll get there in a minute...)* The various compartments are laid out nearly perfectly for the way I work, with an externally accessible zippered compartment for my badges, boarding passes, and passport.* The external compartment is on a flap with adjustable clips that flips back quickly to expose an open pouch and a couple of pen slots, making it secure (enough) to protect certain loose items (like the aforementioned pens, Covid mask, tissues, a snack, etc.).* Underneath that flap are also two decently sized zippered compartments, one larger than the other. You can stuff all kinds of things into these slots, like cables, power adapters, earbud containers, etc.* The main compartment, though, is fairly large given the fact that this is a single-shoulder sling. It comfortably fit *both* a Suface Pro 6 *and* an iPad Pro 12.9 with the Magic Keyboard. There was room left over for a third 13.3\" device if I really wanted to go crazy.* There are external water bottle pockets on either side that are large enough and stretchy enough to carry most 16 to 20oz bottles. (I carry a ham radio walkie talkie in one of the pockets, so ymmv...)After all that positive, there are a few caveats. None of these are deal-breakers, but you should still keep them in mind before you buy.* There are more D-rings than straps to attach to them. Not sure what the D-ring on the shoulder strap is used for.* Speaking of shoulder straps, this is a *single strap* bag, so don't buy it if you think there is even the most remote possibility that you will want to throw it over both shoulders.* It is not the best padded bag I have ever used. If you tend to throw your bag around and trust that it will protect all your electronics, think again. It's padded, just not heavily padded. If you drop it to the ground with a laptop or tablet in it your device will likely sustain some damage.Bonus caveat...* The clip that attaches the strap to the D-rings is not particularly sturdy. It is plastic with a metal spring clip. It works. It will \"probably\" hold up over time, but it is not a heavy-duty plastic clip like on my Swiss Gear backpack. Be careful in how you toss it around and you should be fine.Other than that, I'm already enjoying it and using it regularly as a cross chest bag when I ride my ebike for a visit to the local coffee shop.Recommended.",
