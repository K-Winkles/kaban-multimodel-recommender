                "reviewText": "My first impression of this bag when I saw it was I have a new keeper because this is a quality looking duffel bag. It is the average sized duffel/overnight bag (yes I would have no issue walking into a hotel carrying this.). It will carry quite a bit of clothes for a weekend trip and this is just the size I like for doing so. The polyester/high-density nylon seems very durable to some other materials used to make duffels. I believe this will shed water just fine although I would prefer if they didn't say these were water proof because I'm sure if you sunk it in water the water would get in. The wet shoe compartment will hold your shoes nicely and they have the breather holes that will help reduce moisture to a point. If shoes are in it it will reduce what you can hold in the duffel besides that obviously. I like the straps and clips with the flap on the outside as that is where you could role up a wet raincoat or any coat and strap it on. Plenty of other pockets for different items to boot. The zippers seem to be a nice quality too. The handle and shoulder strap is standard fair for duffels. All in all I'm quite pleased with this duffel but know I've only had it a short while but it seems like it is very durable and should last a long while.One thing to mention, it took just under three weeks to receive so there is that. Hopefully you would get it quicker.",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice, well-designed gym bag. The exterior seems like it is made of fairly sturdy polyester canvas. It has some heft to it (not super flimsy) but can fold up into a relatively small space when not in use. The bag also comes with a padded shoulder strap. There is one exterior zip pocket to stuff your gym shoes in; the shoes will take up space in the interior of the bag, but will be effectively kept separate from other items (nice if you don't want to get street dirt on your gym clothes or equipment). The interior still has plenty of room for your clothes and items. There are several interior zip pockets with waterproof lining--maybe not big enough for wet towels, but certainly big enough for a swimsuit or a sweaty shirt you want to keep separate. One could use the pockets for small bottles of shampoo or soap, as well. There are several exterior zip pockets of various sizes, good for phones or wallets or other smaller, relatively flat items, and some straps on one side to attach a rolled-up yoga mat (nice touch!). There is an exterior mesh pocket on the opposite end of the shoe bag compartment where you could tuck in a water bottle or a some other beverage; it's a bit too wide to hold a water bottle or drink firmly in place, though. This is my own criticism (wish the water bottle mesh were smaller / tighter). One of the exterior zip pockets also has a key fob to attach a key ring. I got the 40L size, which seems plenty big for me--it'll be a roomy gym bag, but still fit vertically in a locker. It's big enough that one could use it as a travel bag for short trips, as well (though I have other bags with laptop compartments that I would prefer for travelling). I intend to use this one as a gym bag primarily. I am pleased with the bag and think it will work well.",

                "reviewText": "I got this duffel bag as I need one to carry my gym items and this bag was very great for that job. The overall thickness is thicker than I expected, and the overall construction of this bag is pretty great. I have tried out many other duffel bags at this level, and most of them are much thinner and lighter than this one. The weight might be something to consider especially if you will constantly be carrying this around for travel, but if not, then I think this bag is perfect. There are plenty of pockets and openings, and a compartment to put shoes as well. I can fit the whole setup: towel, dirty laundry bag, fresh clothes, soap, change of shoes, and some various accessories.The bag has a shoulder strap as well as the regular straps. And honestly, who cares if it's labeled for 'men' or 'women' it functions all the same and looks the same.I just wish that it has a reversible pocket that allows you to fold up the bag into a miniature bag when not in use to save space when storing, but it's not a big deal if it's constantly in use.I would not recommend this duffel bag for carry-on travel as you can still find larger duffel bags that can fit in any airline size limit. I have bags that are even slightly bigger than the size limit, but still able to do carry-on because duffel bags are obviously more flexible than hard suitcases if you understand what I'm trying to say.",

                "reviewText": "Review for Gym Bag for Men 55L Sports Duffel Bags Gym Duffle Bag Women with Shoe Compartment.This is a sturdy duffle with lots of pockets.I love the feet on the bottom of the bag, as my duffle bags always get dirty on the bottom, and when you pick them up then your pants get dirt transfer.There are plenty of pockets. It also has a convenient place to clip your keys so that they don't fall down into the bottom of the bag.The mesh pocket (for water bottles) is more suited for having 2 bottles instead of just one bottle. But it also makes a handy pocket for sweat towels if you go to the gym. That way, the sweaty stuff isn't inside the bag. The mesh pocket is also handy for flip flops when you go to the beach, as the sand isn't inside your bag.If you don't use the shoe compartment, then you can use that room inside the bag, as the shoe compartment squishes flat and out of the way.I also really like the straps to attach the bag to a suitcase handle, which allows this to bag to be used as an overnight bag. You can take this bag along on a trip and still have your hands free.Overall, this is a great bag.",
