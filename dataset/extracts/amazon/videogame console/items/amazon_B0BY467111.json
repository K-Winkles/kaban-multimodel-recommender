I love the form factor and small size, being able to run up to N64 games on a pocketable device for such a low price with great build quality is awesome.",

The little guy can play tons of games with no issues even PlayStation 1 games which blew my mind twisted metal 4 played with no issues. I originally got this for my nephew but I want one now. I will mention this though if you have large hands like me I wear size xl gloves this is not going to be very comfy for you to play for an extended period of time. With that said it is a really nice little handheld and I\u2019m sure my nephew is going to love it. I did have one little issue had usb-c port for charging broke while I was trying to plug it in to charge. I contacted the supplier and they sent me another one thankfully. I\u2019m still going to order another one because the thing plays so well.",
