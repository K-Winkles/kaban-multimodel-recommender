                "reviewText": "Given the quality of the show, I'm surprised the showrunners allowed this game anywhere near release.We had to completely restart the game a couple times (back to main menu, not a full restart) due to it getting stuck in weird places. Gameplay is maybe an hour total. Minigames are very simplistic, which is fine, given the target audience, but they still feel minimal. When you trigger a cutscene (which feels like every 5 seconds) it'll take 15 seconds to start it. So you're left sitting there wondering if it just completely froze or not. Eventually you just get to the point where you're like...oh, must be a cutscene. While we all just look at eachother, and my 7 year old (the staunch Bluey fan) says how bad it is.Deserves 1 star, but I gave it 2 because it actually became comically bad once it reached a certain point.",

                "reviewText": "Bluey is a phenomenal children\u2019s show that respects your kids\u2019 intelligence with witty writing that the whole family can enjoy. The video game adaptation sadly fails in this regard.The game has the visuals and voices from the show but none of the heart. It is very brief for the price, clocking in only a couple hours of content, even with your young kiddos taking the reins. The objectives are boring and feel like the creators are assuming that your children can\u2019t play a \u201creal\u201d video game yet. This will likely put off kids who have ever held a controller. It may be serviceable as a \u201cmy first video game\u201d experience, but there are better options for that as well.Bluey The Videogame is also very glitchy. Characters are constantly getting stuck, freezes frequently occur between cutscenes, and we ran into a few crashes.To its credit, my son is enjoying some of the jokes and he likes dressing up the characters in the various silly hats but I don\u2019t see this one lasting very long. If your child simply has to have the Bluey game, I\u2019d wait until this hits a steep bargain bin.",

                "reviewText": "This was an extremely cute game!! I really enjoyed playing it, and I don't even have kids.My fiance and I are avid Bluey fans as we got hooked on it watching it with our niece. I've since got a few other friends of mine into watching the show who are also childless!This game was easy to play and the story is very cute. I would have loved more games like this when I was a kid. Having 4 players would be a lot of fun and I can imagine how enjoyable it would be to play with kiddos. I'm definitely going to have my niece come over and play it with her.There were some glitches which hopefully can be patched or something, but nothing game breaking. I played as Chilli and every time I got a sticker, it would lag. It also would have been nice to have some variation in voice lines when earning an achievement, but it was still an enjoyable playthrough.I'm not sure I agree with the price point of $50, it feels more like $30 worth of game and quality, but as a Bluey fan, I don't regret buying it.",
