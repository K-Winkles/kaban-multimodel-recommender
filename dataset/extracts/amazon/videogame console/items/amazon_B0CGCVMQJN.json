Definitely packed with games [a few dups due to cross-plats and regions, but not projected towards deceptively beefing up the numbers, so this particular console/device is an honest one from a trustworthy company (Kenhank)]. Plan to purchase again for my mother (who has a nostalgic love for titles spaning Atari-SNES consoles). Comes equipped with a Controller which performs extremely well [unless you prefer using the D-Pad instead of the Analogs while playing titles that may require a diagonal action/commands (fighting games such as Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Tekken etc.)] so another controller equipped with an 8 Directional Pad would be superb (so the $49.99 would be the ideal choice especially for those who are in possession of PC controllers with the afore mentioned function). Controller aside, the device itself is a solid performing hard drive console for the PC/Gaming Laptop. Good Freaking Job Kenhank\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe.",
