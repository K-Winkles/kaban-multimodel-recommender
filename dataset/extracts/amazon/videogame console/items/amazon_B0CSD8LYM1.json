I picked up this game console as more of a \"how good can it be\", but not realizing it contained over 15,000 games. I have now had it for weeks and still am being surprised by obscure games I keep finding on it. I spend a lot of time in the arcades as teen, and being able to play those games on this console is a treat. Sure, there are some games that don't play on this emulator platform, but there are so many that play without issue that the ones that don't are a tiny minority. I repaired/rebuilt full-sized upright video game cabinets that only played one game, so having all those games on this one handheld console is pretty amazing.The controls of this game do good representing different consoles. Cross controls, quad buttons, thumb joysticks, and four triggers cover most games. The screen is bright and sharp and the battery seems to last much longer than I expected. The game came with a screen protector that is a nice bonus and a set of headphones. Overall, I've been very happy with it and find myself playing obscure games I have never heard of just because I can.",

                "reviewText": "Wow! My earlier days came rushing back once I figured out how to use this game. The instructions are not too clear. But it's not too difficult to figure out. This Handheld game has all of the games from your past whether they are on Ninetendo original, Super Ninetendo, Sega Genesis, or Sony Playstation. There are other systems as well, some of which I've never heard of. I couldn't believe that I was playing Donkey Kong Country and Earthworm Jim 2! The game has good color and decent graphics. This is a very fun game and it would make a great gift for those of a certain age. As you scroll through screens, different controllers come up and that's how you tell which system you're on. Then, there is a subset of games you can play from that system. It sure beats buying all of those systems and games again! Love this!",

The system I paid $100 for has nicer buttons, a recessed screen protector and better sticks, but this one gives you cheaper build quality, but at a significantly lower cost.I wouldn't hesitate to buy one of these for retro gaming at this price. It will play up to PS1 games at full speed (definitely not all PS1 games), so that gives you several systems and libraries to choose from. It comes loaded with plenty of games and it is easy to add more if you wish.This little Gameboyish hand held is really, really cool for less than a new console/PC game.",
