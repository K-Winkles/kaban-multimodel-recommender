It\u2019s great if you loved all the old classics like Mario(all of them), pac man, etc. I even play it when my kids aren\u2019t playing! It is small, it can be fragile with hard floors but so far it has held up with a few falls we thought it wouldn\u2019t! Small screen with pretty good quality overall, and batteries last decent if they remember to turn it off. Overall great for our 5 year old, my 3 year old even ended up getting one bc they were fighting over it. Overall great buy for the price.",
