I bought it but I hardly play it because it gets really boring after 10 minutes of playing any game on it. It\u2019s okay for a 6 or 7 year old child but not for a grown up. I tried giving it to my 13 year old daughter and she gave it back to me she says it\u2019s boring and I agree with her. Anyway I would give it to a little kid 5-7 year old. The battery life is not so good either. I wouldn\u2019t buy this or anything like this again.",
