                "reviewText": "For the most part, this headset is awesome! The USB works no problem, the noise cancelling is really nice, the audio quality is clear, and it's a comfortable headset. My only complaint is that when playing with others and using the microphone, it is really quiet even with turning your voice volume all the way up. You basically have to try and bend the mic to rest against your face for others to actually hear you clearly. It's a pretty good product for the price and I would probably buy it again if I can't afford a better, more expensive headset.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased based on other reviews and glad I did. Sound was overall good, and the 2.4 Ghz connection was easy and immediate upon setup. These headphones differ from others in several features that I care about.Pros:* They have cloth ear cups vs. the faux pleather. Much easier on the head and reduces the sweat/tacky feeling after wearing them for extended periods of time.* Ear cups are big enough and very comfortable and they are hinged for greater movement and less pressure. Not huge either and lightweight too.* LED light can be toggled on or off. I don't need or care about LED lights and it increases battery charge to just keep it off anyway.* The headphones stay ON, when plugging into the USB-C charge cable. I LOVE this as I don't have to constantly turn them on when I next grab them to use. Most others shut off as soon as you plug them in, and then you spend extra 15 seconds to hold the power button and turn them back on every time you try and use them. I like just picking them up, pulling the cable, and they are ready to go.* Mute button is easy to find and speaks to you audibly if you turn it on or off (as well as a visual aspect described below).Cons:* The volume level is analog dial vs. buttons. I guess I prefer the buttons and visual feedback onscreen.* The microphone itself just looks wonky. It has good range of motion and sounds fine, but it's just that their feature is that the end lights up. So no foam cover on the end, but instead a plastic end which lights up when active and off when on mute. So I guess it's both pro and con, depending on if you like the visual aspect or not, or if you prefer to have a noise canceling foam end on it.Overall - I love these headphones. They fit perfectly, don't make your ears or the area around them sweaty or tacky, and the features are exactly what I wanted.",

                "reviewText": "I've had these for a month or two now, for the most part they're good wireless headphones with a significant battery life and good quality sound and mic (though I'm not particularly good at discerning audio quality). The main reason I felt prompted to leave a review though was that almost routinely at this point when I turn it on, at some random point maybe 5-30 minutes afterwards it will randomly turn off and back on, interrupting whatever I was listening to. It doesn't seem to happen again until its turned back off and on, but its consistent enough to be very annoying. Also the plastic on the inner part of the ears presses into the ear a bit, which I find fine for 3-4 hours of use but as someone who works from home and is constantly listening to something or other, it becomes quite uncomfortable for longer durations.",
