                "reviewText": "Ok so.....I have these games on their real original systems. I also have some clone type machines. In my picture there is a much more expensive product to the left that you can add roms to. It is a better quality thing that costs eight times as much. I'm not reviewing THAT though. I have considered that for this review to NOT compare apples and oranges.On the right...the red one is this actual product I'm going to review beyond \"my kid loves it\" reviews on here. I want you to know WHY someone would love or dislike it.So I got this for around 14 US dollars. I had one previously about 4 years ago that cost the same and looked the same. I think maybe that one had 500 games... Regardless the colors on some games are really over saturated on this and there is no way to fix that. Some games are running faster than originals....the famous plumber guy game is too fast. It's playable...but is amped up and if you know the original you WILl notice it. This is true with a few on here....if you don't know the originals then you might not notice what is \"off\" with color, sound and speed.There are NOT 400 games. Maybe 200 but I'm not sure. Games repeat on these things so expect that. Or it could be the same game with some kind of tweak or power ups or something. Scroll through it all but I don't think there's more than 200 legit games you would recognize. But then, that's a LOT of games for a little handheld cheap thing.Paperboy. It's the NES version...as are most games on here....and it runs nicely. I love having that game portable! Defender works nicely. Bubble Bobble, Dig Dug, 10 yard Fight (which I have always loved) ...Snow Bros...Tennis, Baseball, Contra, Donkey Kong....quite a few really good oldies that even if they run a little fast I would imagine your kid or Grandma won't notice.What the thing IS...is a cheap emulator that does have some early games on it that are playable. And for the price of a full MEAL at fastfood....you can have this.If you want a better experience, pay more and get the better handheld that games aren't sped up, more games, ads roms, etc.This is barebones basic. The screen is bright and I didn't notice much for problems than over saturated colors on some games but it isn't a high quality screen or machine. But it does pretty good for the money. If this had been available in the 90s I would have flat freaked and it would've been the best thing ever. I still think it's pretty great having spent my childhood stuck to a tv to play any video games. The battery charge will last a really long time...probably 12 hours.... and you will find games on here you love. Nuts and Milk or Milk and Nuts is fun and is often ignored by gamers....Loderunner...Mappy....more games you know and some pure trash games.I have it because I don't want to take my 90 dollar retro system just everywhere. I can take this instead to a lake or beach or picnic and not worry much.It feels very light and cheapish but that cheap feel is mostly how light it is...and of course it is smaller than the old Gameboys. Buttons work well and don't feel too squishy. Volume is controllable and the sound is...sort of horrible. I would grade sound worse than screen quality.This is for: nostalgia...a good gift for any age range but just understand....there are MUCH better systems to play these old games but they cost a lot more. I'm satisfied to play about 25 of these games A LOT. I can play Paperboy till my eyeballs fall out. It is worth a price between 12 and 20 IMO. A child or adult or elderly person should enjoy this. I did NOT hook it up to a tv. But you can. I have no reason to do that as I just wanted a little pocket gaming device that's cheap enough I won't cry for days if it falls in the lake.It's a 4.1 for what it IS. It's not junk but it's not perfect or great. In the inexpensive category....it rocks socks!It's worth the money if you know what it is and what it is not.",

There aren\u2019t as many as it claims, but there is enough of a selection. It has Super Mario and other classics. It does connect to the TV. However, the remote is still the \u201cgameboy\u201d along with the second remote. So you end up sitting very close to the TV. It would be better to connect to a computer screen.",
