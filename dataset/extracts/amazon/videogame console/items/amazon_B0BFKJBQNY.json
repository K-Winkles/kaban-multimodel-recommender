                "reviewText": "I like that it has multiple games on it but it definitely has some flaws. One thing to take note is that the gaming system does not have the capability to save the game natively. You have to save the state of the game using the built in emulator. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t find this out until I lost three hours of progress on The Legend of Zelda. Another complaint is that not all games loaded on the system work. For example, the sims game has stuttering that make the game unplayable. Other than those two minor issues the gaming system is very portable and still has a large collection of games for hours of endless fun.",

But nope I \"saved\" it atleast 15x literally all to find nothing when I returned after 2hrs of game play there was nothing it wanted to start new game everytime so I went to the \"load progress\" option on the system itself and there was nothing! Then I find out it has to be saved to the SD card provided........ why don't it automatically do that so how is that done? Please if I'm wrong somone explain to me in clear English and I will retract this bad review but until it's cleared up imo it's one of the reasons I left games alone when they went to online everything it's all about money now smh not about the gamer or the fun and the games.....",

I tried messaging seller and only got an automated bot.I would have given 5 stars otherwise because this is a good quality game with lots of nostalgic games from my childhood.",
