Only thing was the short wire on the controllers but the 8bitdo wireless adaptor fixes that. True blue also adding 100s of games was worth it.As long as your paying 40$ or less it is great.Launch price and limited games and short wires and dual shock controllers hurt the launch an reputation of it.But as I said true blue usb sticks and a 8bitdo wireless adaptor fixes this (still won\u2019t be able to use the right DualShock unfortunately but that is because of the emulation software on the ps classic)",

It is a little disappointinog that it only comes with 20 games and none of them are \"Silent Hill\" (missed opportunity, Sony). This does not come with an AC power adapter, but I just used the one that came with my phone--works wonderfully! All the cords fit into the system securely and it powers on and off properly. Al external buttons are operational. I bought this unit \"new\" from \"Cotree\" but the language was was not set to the default and there were saves on it from whomever owned it previously, so I suggest buying it from another seller.",

So I guess my biggest complaint is with the lack of attention it was given when it first released. Or perhaps the Lister of the product not saying in big bold letters \"ONLY comes with these 20 games\". The funny thing is though that the box is bigger than expected for a console of this size and heavier with the amount of protective boxes on the inside. So you wouldn't believe how baffled I was when I opened the box to find something so cute in place of an actual console. Some of the games been slightly changed since so much time has passed but they work perfectly. But, as I said earlier, you cannot add games to this 20-not-so-classic title lineup.",

Trae preinstalado \"Metal Gear Solid\", \"Syphon Filter 1\" y m\u00e1s, en fin muy contento con la adquisici\u00f3n, tardo un d\u00eda m\u00e1s en llegar a la fecha se\u00f1alada pero al hacerlo lo hizo sin da\u00f1o y muy bien empacado.",
