They actually like the game however the remote for 2player games doesn\u2019t work and when I hook it up to the tv it glitches. Has a weird sound that comes out; nevertheless the kids seem to enjoy but I would only recommend if you\u2019re using it to keep them busy on long car rides because of the battery life.",

                "reviewText": "My seven year old is addicted! We love all the different super Mario games and 2 player games. The additional plug in remote included is genius. My five year old enjoys being player 2, though she is not as technologically advanced as her sis and has a harder time timing jumps and such. The battery could last longer, but for 300+ games and at least 2 hours of straight gameplay, the value is astounding! It can be played while charging. It has a headphone jack, although I haven't tried it. If my kids were to break it, I'd buy it again, though it's a pretty lightweight but sturdy construction. I even enjoy sitting back and playing with them. The screen is great and lit to be played at night. I haven't tried it outside, but figure it would be fine in shade or in a car as most screens are. It's a comparable screen to the Gameboy advance with its own backlighting. There is volume adjustment which is much needed bc it has some loud sound when it's all the way up. All the games are old school graphics which is a real throwback that I love. I haven't found the game pictured in the product image and am wondering if that type of graphic is on this system or if it is just a image that was placed. It doesn't have any save features, so once you die in super Mario for example, you'll have to start from the beginning. This might be frustrating for older kids, but for my young kids, it gives them a video game history experience and hand eye coordination practice in quite a few types and styles of games. Either way, I'm happy with my purchase and would buy again if this got broken or lost! I'll probably buy one when my 2 and 3 year old reach this age.",

And the thumb control on the unit is useless as it spins around 360 degrees as your trying to control. The D pad doesn't repsond some times... Basically, don't waste your money. All the positive reviews must be talking about something else, because I don't see what they are saying in this unit.",
