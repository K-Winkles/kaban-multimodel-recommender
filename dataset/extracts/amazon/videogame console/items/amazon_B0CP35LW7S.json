                "reviewText": "When I first put this on my TV I thought I had defective controllers. They wouldn't do anything so I chatted with an Amazon Associate online to attempt to troubleshoot the issue. After having the game on for about 5 to 10 minutes the first controller turned on, a few minutes later the second one turned on. There are plenty of games on here and I'm hoping my sons will enjoy it for Christmas. So be ready for the controllers to take awhile to sync with the game. AAA batteries are needed for them. The directions leave much to be desired, the translation from Chinese to English is a little off. For the price o don't think it was a bad purchase.Just an important update, in order to turn the controllers on all you need to do is hold down the home button on the middle of the controller. I figured this out through trying to turn them on. The instructions don't tell you this.",
