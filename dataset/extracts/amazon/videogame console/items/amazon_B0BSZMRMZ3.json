Lets put a 40.00 machine in a poly bag for shipping through the postal service so the box window which is 3/4 of the box is damaged on both sides. Maybe you should retain that worker for being so lazy. myarcade i would get a 5 out of 5 and amazon a -1 out of 5 for failure to package safely.",

                "reviewText": "The screens on these micro player pros are bad and scratch SUPER easy....doesn't matter how new or delicate your microfiber cloths are these screens are terrible. I've gone through 2 atari micro players and my Megaman looks pretty rough already and it's not a week old so it's consistent across all of them pretty much. Not worth the $40 and is disappointing since the older batch of Micro Players do not have this screen issue. Save your money",

                "reviewText": "No way, this handheld is cute and the Atari inspired design on a custom cabinet is also really nice. The pros end here. The plastics are cheap (the buttons are cheap also), the stickers on the cabinet are badly placed, that control stick is irritating due to its bad quality when it comes about controlling the games, all paddle games are unplayable due to the lack of a paddle controller of course, the emulation is under the standard (Missile Command is slower than usual and some games have serious emulation issues) and this is INEXCUSABLE for a product like this in 202x. Plus, the \"bonus games\" are nothing more than NES games licensed by PIko: c'mon, this is an Atari product! THIS PRODUCT FEATURES AN ATARI LICENSE SO IT MUST FEATURE ATARI GAMES, NOT NINTENDO GAMES. Why not 7800 or Arcade games, instead than uninspired or even bad NES games? What a disgusting way to ruin a celebrative product like this. No way, My Arcade! I sent it back, of course.Judging from what products we will get in 2024, My Arcade will produce Atari Super and Mega Player, both bigger and with a joystick, a spinner, a paddle and even a keypad mounted on them: so, what's the reason for choosing this, when the other option provides a product (ok, we have to wait a little for now, but...that's the truth in every case) that will get all the features that are needed for playing these games in the way how they should be played? In that case, I hope for My Arcade that they will resolve all the emulation issues. Totally disappointed.",
