There are many amusing games on it. It is easy to hold and fits in a pocket. Quote from the user, \u201cIt\u2019s awesome. I like how long the batteries last. The buttons are marked clearly and work well. I like the shape. The games are cool. It has all the games I like and wanted to play. I really recommend it.\u201d The only drawback is that a few games have text which is not available in English. That didn\u2019t really matter though. Understanding the text was not necessary to play the games.I tried a different handheld game before I purchased this one. It did not even last an entire afternoon before it was completely useless. This is by far the better choice.",
