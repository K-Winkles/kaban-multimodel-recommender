                "reviewText": "For those scrolling: This is an okay little video game player. Lots of knockoff games, a little wonky with the clock speed, and few big titles you know. Perfectly okay.I like video games just fine. Also, I like retro games just fine (had an NES and SNES growing up). Also, I am a fully grown adult :)There are maybe ten to twenty titles on this you'll want to play (and a lot of others you'll look into out of curiosity). The ones you're looking for are generally solid enough emulations (albeit the Japanese versions, which is fine for most stuff). I'm not naming names because I suspect that is a way to get the review flagged, but the ones you are wondering about, the ones from that game system in the late 1980s you used to play with rented games from Blockbuster? Yeah, there are likely on here. Nothing too much later than 1991 or so though. Note: The knockoffs are here and they are sometimes funny, sometimes briefly entertaining, sometimes a remask of other IPs, but always worth less than five minutes of play.There are some pretty noticeable game speed issues, likely due to uncalibrated clock speeds (the rate which the game should run against the hardware), usually leading to games running 25-50% faster than they should. This is fine for most people who are just looking for a novelty to kill time, but if you are a person who has a lot of experience with any of these games you'll find it a kinda difficult to readjust.The size is good, a little smaller than the original gameboy. The battery is ample. The color is fun. The screen works pretty well. The buttons are not super clicky nor are they overly mushy, and fairly responsive.So, if you want a retro devise you can treat as more or less disposable for a trip or to entertain children or anything like that, this will absolutely work for you.",

                "reviewText": "So first thing worth mentioning. You do not actually get 500 games with this. Many of the games were duplicated, and many of the games were \"reskinned\". So for example, there is one they labelled as Super Mario 6, but it is actually just Tiny Toon Adventures with Mario (the one from Super Mario 3) in place of Buster Bunny....There are also numerous repeats, too many to even count. But what I mean by this is that many games are in the list multiple times.Now, that being said, there are still a lot of really cool, old games, on this device, and it definitely worth ordering.Some of the best games, IMO...The Original NES Super MarioSuper Mario Bros. 3Pac-ManTiny Toon AdventuresContraDonkey Kongand many more...Those were just the ones I can remember as I write this.The device worked flawlessly when connected to a TV that was compatible with the VGA cables it uses. The controller also worked great and playing with two players was perfect.The device itself does feel a bit cheaply made. But If you take care of it, it will certainly provide hours of playtime. I have spent quite a few hours since I got this playing through all of Super Mario Bros. 3.I highly recommend this game device, especially for how much it cost.Giving 4 stars because the Dpad on the device can be a little finicky, and can register the wrong directions if you arent precise with how you are pressing on the Dpad. And Also for the fact that there actually is not 500 games. There are 500 labels, but not 500 different games.I kind of expected some shenanigans like that, so I am not disappointed, and in my opinion, there is still plenty of unique classic games included to justify the value.",
