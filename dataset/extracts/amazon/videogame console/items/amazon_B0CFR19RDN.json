You'll see choices upon choices for games you played as a kid, and some that never existed (like the 4th, 5th, and 6th installments of the plumber brothers games).As far as the screen, like many of these handhelds you need to hold these at odd angles, otherwise you'll get a polarization effect. This was common with older LCD displays, but they always made sure you were able to see it just fine while looking at it dead-on. This one, not so much.The games themselves work, although listening to some of the iconic music from games from my childhood, you can tell the games are sometimes sped up slightly.But overall, the process of choosing and playing a game is extremely cumbersome. With over 500 games and 8 games listed on a page, there needs to be a better way to choose other than just scrolling. If you like a game that's #250 on the list, you probably won't want to scroll through it every time. Less is actually more when it comes pre-installed games on a handheld.There are also no save states, so you better hope you can get through your game in one sitting.I wasn't able to test the A/V out, since I don't have a TV that these will work on anymore. Also the second controller that comes in the package feels extremely cheap.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I love this. Everything about it reminds me of growing up. It has the actual games on here, not the knock off versions. The volume button is adjustable, it's rechargeable (micro but comes with the cable), and easy to work. It took a sec to figure out the buttons, you have to hit start to select the language and the game. I can't attest to the battery life yet, but it has a nice size screen. The controller is a decent size & comfortable to hold. It comes with audio video cables, so if you have a newer tv you'll have to get something to convert that into hdmi so you can use it on your t.v.. Honestly this would make a great gift for age 5-75. I did upload a video to show how it works. This was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my hubby, but I might be keeping it for myself, and just share. :)",

Lots and lots of great games and several NES titles like Mario bros and Mario bros 3 along with galaga, pac-man and others. The in hand feel is really comfortable and the screen is plenty big and bright. Highly recommend this handheld.",
