                "reviewText": "My desk became very cluttered as I accumulated computer and gaming gear, so I've been looking at gear organizers to make the best use of space. I considered other form factors, like hooks on the wall or under my desk. Because I use them all the time, I decided to get this multi-stand to keep the gear on top of my desk and easy to reach.This stand does exactly what I need. In my case, it's holding my headphones and three full-sized gamepad controllers. I reclaimed a whole bunch of desk space, because now all four items fit in the space that one of them used to take on its own. And there's room for more!It has six \"shelves\" to hold stuff. The foot of each shelf has a soft pad to protect your gear and keep it from slipping. The edges of the stand are polished, so I'm not worried about scratches if I bump gear into it by accident.The stand also includes grooves for cable management, to help keep it tidy. I use a single four-way fast charging USB C cable (https://amzn.to/3Hh8CyK - highly recommended) to charge all four pieces of gear at once while minimizing cable clutter.I could easily fit one more item (another controller, or my Switch, for example) on the open shelf, and in a pinch one more item on the shelf that's between my headphone ear cups. Even with this much stuff on it, the weighted base keeps it stable. I've had it loaded up for a couple of months and have never knocked it over or had something fall off.Assembly was simple. There's no set height or angle of orientation for each pair of shelves, so you position them where you want and tighten the knobs. After tightening, the shelves are locked in place, but this is also the cause of my one-star deduction. You have to crank the knob pretty tight to keep the shelves secure, but this results in some metal on metal grinding, scratching the post where the knob touches it.These minor scratches are purely cosmetic and don't affect the sturdiness of the stand. But in my case, I had to move the shelves around a few times before I found my optimal setup, so my stand has some exposed scratches. I only notice them if I'm really looking, so I debated whether to even deduct a star. If minor scratches don't bother you, consider this a five-star review.I highly recommend this multi-stand.",

                "reviewText": "First, this was very easy to assemble. I opened the box and put it together while standing at the kitchen table. You can set the controller rests (1, 2, or all 3) at any height you want and turn them in any direction. I was skeptical of the small platforms that the controller sits on but it hasn't been an issue. The base is large enough to prevent any wobble when adding or removing controllers to the tower. You can even run a USB cable up the tower to charge your controllers in place!Aside from assembly, function, and features, this thing just looks cool (pics for proof). How awesome is a tower of controllers? Anyways, 5 out of 5! I will likely purchase another.*I did also test with headphones, and they work but looks a little funny. Cloud Orbit might just be too big for this thing, aesthetically. I wasn't really looking for a headphone stand anyway.",

Also, Gamecube controllers pretty much won't fit on this, as mine keeps falling off. The upsides to it are it hold standard controllers well and seems like it'd last a good while, and it was very easy to assemble.",
