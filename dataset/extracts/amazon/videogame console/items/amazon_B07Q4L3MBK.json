The new one seems to have slightly better screen resolution and (yay) the addition of a headphone jack, which was sorely missing on older models. It seems well made (at least for the price point) and it works perfectly. Of the 168 games included on it, about 20 are actually playable/worth playing, but even if all you ever do on it is play Dr. Mario, Dig Dug or Donkey Kong, you'll absolutely get your money's worth out of it.",

The games are great and the adults love them, too. It was a lot of fun watching the kids show all the older family and them playing back and forth. They charge well and the battery last a good while, but you'd have to charge them if traveling more than a couple hours. The only real downside is that progress isn't saved, so they start over every time the start the device.",

                "reviewText": "Nostalgic value = ImmenseTime killer = AbsolutelyFun to play = Yes!Game options = 168It's really that simple from an enjoyment perspective. I really like this thing so far. My only beefs with it are as follows:1) High scores are not retained after shutting it off. Unless you plan on leaving it on perpetually, don't expect to see your high scores next time you pick it up.2) The buttons (particularly the A/B/X/Y ones) are smaller than I expected. That said, I'm a big dude with big hands, so I'm sure this is just a personal preference for them to be bigger. They'll be fine for most folks I'd imagine. The smaller buttons also didn't really make it difficult for me to play, but just a tiny bit less comfortable.3) No battery level indicator. There appears to be no way to tell if the battery is running out. That said, I've played it for around 5-6 hours so far without the battery running out, so I figure if you just plug it in when you aren't using it then you shouldn't have any problems.4) Lots of games to choose from, but they seem to be in a random order in the list. I would have expected them to be in the list alphabetically, but they aren't which can make it annoying to find a particular game.5) Screen is harder to see in high sunlight. This didn't really surprise me as it's a common issue with electronics, but I just thought I'd mention it.Overall, I'm happy with this game \"console\" for what it is, but the annoyances are causing me to give it 4 stars instead of a full 5.",

                "reviewText": "The gaming console was supposed to be yellow. I got a black one with a huge scratch on the screen. Then, the hand held game didn't work unless it was plugged in and the cord had a short in it. My son still wanted to keep it because he thought he was doing so awesome at playing the games. That's when I actually took a look at the gaming console and I realized that my son wasn't actually playing the games! The games played on their own and my 5 yr old just thought he was playing! I was flabbergasted! I couldn't believe that we had been scammed! I immediately returned it after seeing that! So, don't waste your money. It's cheaply made, the battery life is terrible and you're not really playing the games...the games are playing themselves!!",

The batteries last forever I\u2019ve only had to charge them once or twice since Christmas. We have not tried to hook it up to the TV yeah we do want to try that eventually. My 12-year-old girl thinks it\u2019s fun to play too and so do my husband and I. great value!",
