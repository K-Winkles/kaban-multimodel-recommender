Having remembered when the original Nintendo came out we didn\u2019t have inflated expectations. Yes the save option doesn\u2019t exist on all games and yes you have to hit the restart button to return to the game menu BUT in spite of those 2 draw backs we find this game system a ton of fun especially at such a reasonable price",
