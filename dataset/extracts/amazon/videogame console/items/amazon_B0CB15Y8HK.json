It comes with a ton of games, but a lot of the arcade games just don\u2019t work. MAME compatibility is always a problem, and it\u2019s clear that not every game was tested. All of the other systems and games work fine so far. Fortunately it\u2019s easy to load your own games onto the device. Overall, recommended if you want to play retro games on the go.",

                "reviewText": "I did not have a high expectation, because I was thinking it might be too good to be true. However, the truth slapped by face. I really enjoyed the time playing with it. I was kinda addicted to it in the first couple of weeks.First of all, it does support the games it advertises, Sega MD (my favorite), Nitendo FC (my very first game console when I was a kid), arcade games, PS2, NES, SNES, etc.Second, it has many games, including famous ones, such as Contra, Jackal, Streets of Rage in MD (my favorite game of all time), The Punisher, Warriors of Fate, Cadilacs and Dinosaurs, to name a few. However, some famous games are missing, like Super Mario. I guess it could be the copyright issue? And Double Dragon 3 in FC keeps crashing.Third, the quality of the console is impressive. The display is a IPS display, which makes the image quality superior. It also has a speaker. It supports ear phone. You can plug in an ear phone. The buttons are a little stiff at the beginning. That said, it's hard to press, especially the arrow keys. But after some time playing, it becomes much better. To even better enjoy the game, I also buy a usb controller. Yes, it supports a controller! What a design!Fourth, battery lasts long. For a FC or NES game, I have never had the battery drained. For MD games, it lasts 3 to 4 hours. For arcade games, it lasts about 3 hours. For PS games, it lasts about 1 hour. That's much better than I can image.Overall, I really recommend this game console model. I believe you can download your own games to an external TF card if it doesn't have in its internal storage, after all it is a Linux system and it runs the simulator behind the scene. Therefore, it should be able to support a lot of things. In terms of the value, I do think it's worth it. Especially if you are like me, playing console games in late 80s or early 90s, you will find a lot of valuable memory in your childhood.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Durable, versatile retro gaming device that's almost perfect",
                "reviewText": "I bought this device after seeing several recommendations online for a cheap, durable retro gaming device with a great screen and Gameboy-like form factor. The particular model I got comes with a case but thanks to the built in screen protector and very solid build quality I don't think there's anything wrong with carrying it directly in a pocket in most places. All the buttons feel great, battery life is good, and the ergonomics (I'd say I have relatively large hands) felt surprisingly comfortable. The only real issue I have is that I prefer a softer D-pad especially when playing RPGs, the stiffness of the D-pad here is tolerable but got uncomfortable on my left thumb after long periods of play. For titles like WarioWare or Final Fantasy Tactics Advance this isn't really an issue because the D-pad motion is broken up, but I definitely felt it after trying to marathon through Earthbound.The first thing I did after getting this device is replacing the lousy default SD card and stock OS using Retro Game Corps Anbernic RG35XX Starter Guide, this whole process was somewhat time consuming but reasonably painless. Replacing the OS to something with a cleaner UI and more functionality has pretty much pretty much a rite of passage in 2023 on a lot of these budget Chinese handheld devices thanks to the hard work of the volunteer retro modding community. Once you get Retroarch going on GarlicOS the whole experience becomes super intuitive and clean and you get loads of options like resolution scaling and in-game shortcuts for functions like screenshots and save states that are very easy to use once you get the hang of them. I mainly am interested in playing SNES and GBA games on this and overall the performance of all of them even with upscaling was basically flawless, but being able to play PS1 games on GarlicOS is a really cool feature I haven't tried yet and from what I've seen online the performance of games like Final Fantasy 7 is surprisingly smooth as well.Overall I'm very happy with this device so far and am getting a lot of use out of it, but the setup was a little annoying and the uncomfortably stiff D-pad means I probably won't be spending hours and hours on end playing this thing for certain games that require a lot of continual D-pad motion.",

                "reviewText": "I got this this bad boy for nostalgia, and emulation on the go. I love the feel of this (texture) and the size is great. Dual SD card slots so that 1 can run the OS and the 2nd can hold all your ROMs.I had to figure out this thing in order to get certain features working like the theme switcher. Shame that the literature online is not detailed enough for experienced Linux users like myself. For example: nowhere does it say that the folders have to be CAPS LOCKED for things to work correctly...only through trial and error did I figure it out.I like my RG35XX better than the Miyoo Mini Plus, despite the lack of extra feature. I think the issues I had up front getting this setup just right allow me to finally be in a state of \"pick up and play\" for the Anbernic.If you don't like tinkering, don't get this, or just stick to defaults. I can say now that my theme, icons, and ROMs are exactly how I want them, this is an ideal machine to play on.",
