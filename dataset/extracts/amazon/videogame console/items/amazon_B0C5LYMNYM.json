                "reviewText": "I have yet to upgrade from my Wii to the WiiU or the switch, but I still want my kids to be able to play the Wii when they are old enough. With my big screen TV, we aren't able to connect the Wii to it as the TV doesn't have the proper inputs. I saw this online and decided to give it a try.The packaging for this product is simple but convenient. There is no unnecessary packaging and the box comes with the Wii to HDMI adapter and the instruction manual.The use of this product is extremely simple as it is just a plug and play. It comes with a port for the HDMI to plug in to, but also includes an audio port if you want to have the audio sent to external speakers. The quality of the image and sound are great and don't seem to have any issues.Overall Impression: I really wanted to be able to use my Wii on our big screen TV, but because of how new it is, we weren't able to connect it. With this product, we were able to connect the Wii to our new TV and it works great. I am sure my kids will be able to enjoy the Wii now that they can play it on our TV. Would definitely recommend.",
