Lot of games that brings me back to my childhood days. Very rusty lol. Getting used to how to exit games. Some are easier than some. Overall not bad. I found using the Y botton and the select botton helps. Instructions guid very helpful too for a first time users. Like the music while surfing through all the games. Love how light weight the controllers are too. Very nice concept for us gammers. Very thing came as it shows on the website. Easy to turn on and off. The little switch under the controller very nice idea. Put the controller on loads up very nicely. Some games are repeated multiple times. Do to different covers that came out for special addition. Very nice touch. Gave a 4 star for overall games and fun playing it. Some of the old games sometimes freezes up while playing.",
