They got married, had children, and enjoyed dancing their way through life and programming games together. Then on one very special day, Martin had dinner with a friend who showed him a game his son drew. This sparked the idea for Martin to create a sophisticated program to turn drawings into playable video games. The momentum, excitement, and success grew into a full-time passion business!

Pixicade Mobile Game Maker sets a new standard in both entertainment and learning. There is an appeal for a wide spectrum of interests: kids that love drawing, kids that love video games, kids that like solving puzzles...they all are amazed at seeing their creations come to life! Parents love it because kids will actually put down their phones or tablets and pick up markers and paper. Kids love it because they can draw their own games, share them with their friends, and play them on their phone or tablet. Pixicade stores your game creations to come back to and play any time. The only thing more impressive than how innovative Pixicade is would be how extremely easy it is to use. Kids get to draw a picture of an idea for a video game using colored markers and real paper. Then, using the Pixicade app available for iOS and android, all that is needed is to snap a pic of the piece of paper! From there, the image is brought to life as an actual video game that can be played on a phone or tablet! The app only requires a camera and an internet connection. (iOS 9.0 and up, android 6.0 and up) The ultimate \u201cwow\u201d factor for hands-on fun, Pixicade was created by a high school art teacher who saw imagination and creativity in students decreasing. There is an educator\u2019s device subscription specifically made for the classroom. Pixicade is also a STEM.org authenticated educational product.

Unfortunately, the markers which were a necessary component of the game, were missing! He had to wait until we purchased said markers and he was very disappointed. It\u2019s a great gift and a very creative activity for a child, however, they should be more careful to make sure everything needed is included! Thus the 3 stars.",

                "reviewText": "Man I love this thing, but my 8 and 6 year old sons love it even more. We\u2019re those parents who are a little crazy about \u201cscreen time\u201d with our kids. Let me tell you something - MOST of the time is spent with the kids building their game - the markers, paper and, most importantly, their imaginations of drawing new games are 90% of the fun because they know that their drawing will eventually \u201ccome to life\u201d on the iPad. It sounds crazy, but it\u2019s true. The different colors are used to create different things that the game automatically recognize on paper - e.g. use \u201cred\u201d to draw hazards; use \u201cgreen\u201d to make your character that can move, etc. My boys draw anything and, like magic, the screen brings it to life and the remaining 10% blows their little minds (and the parents minds too). Not really sure how it works, but we have a giant notebook full of different drawings and games, two boys who can\u2019t stop using it and two parents who are totally OK with this kind of \u201cscreen time.\u201d",
