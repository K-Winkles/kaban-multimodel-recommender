The search feature is highly practical, along with the ability to mark favorites. It comes bundled with two controllers and is exceptionally user-friendly. Immersing oneself in these games truly evokes a sense of nostalgia, harkening back to the 90s or even the 80s. It includes classics like Super Mario, Donkey Kong, Contra, and even some relatively \"recent\" titles too. There's an abundance of fighting games and numerous imported titles. The convenience of its portability is something I particularly appreciate. great experience",
