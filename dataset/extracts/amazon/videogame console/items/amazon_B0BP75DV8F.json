                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t know anything about handheld game consoles like the Switch, so I can\u2019t compare this to those. As an old school game player, I was pleasantly surprised to find emulators preinstalled for Playstation 1, NES, Gameboy/Color/Advanced, NEOGEO, MAME, and a couple others I don\u2019t recognize. The device comes with internal storage and a 32GB micro SD card nearly full with games for all of the emulators. I was able to copy the supplied game card over to a 64GB SD card on a PC, which left plenty of room to add additional games/roms. My favorite thing is the MAME emulation, I dropped a few hundred old MAME ROM images I have had for over 20 years, and although they didn\u2019t all work, many did, allowing me to enjoy again some of the games I enjoyed in my youth at the arcade. The controls aren\u2019t great but they are adequate. The side to side viewing angle is surprisingly good for a screen of this size and price, although as might be expected the screen washes out quickly if tilted even slightly up or down.Like I said I can\u2019t say how a kid would react to this compared to one of the fancier modern consoles, but for basically the price of a restaurant meal for two I find this to be a decent bargain.",

You will want to plug this unit into a PC with good antivirus and start cleaning up files that don't have actual game titles. Some of these files outright say \"porno\" on it and if you play it through the system you will see dirty pictures. Off hand I went through the SNES folder in the external memory of this game system and there were at lease 50 files like this .",
