Conquer thirst and hunger, battle the elements, create weapons and stay safe against hostile forces including other players, scientists, bears, wolves or even succumb to fire, drowning or radiation poisoning. In the struggle for survival and supremacy, players can build tiny cabins in the woods to huge scrap metal fortresses in an attempt to stay safe, as well as craft a variety of weapons, bombs and traps. A game without rules: Rust doesn\u2019t tell its inhabitants what to do. Players are free to be deceptive and aggressive with intense player vs. player combat, raiding and looting, but there is potentially even more to be earned with a team of friendly players by your side. Key Features: \u25cf Explore a vast and mysterious post-apocalyptic island and figure out how to keep yourself alive. \u25cf Intense PVE and PVP battles \u2013 Befriend or fight other players, the choice is yours. \u25cf Conquer thirst and hunger, battle elements, craft gear and stay safe in a world where everything wants you dead.",

                "reviewText": "Background: I've been playing Rust since it was in Alpha phase on PC. I've seen many changes to this game over the years, from farming Blue prints, to the experience point system, back to BPs, then to the current skill tree system.In all that time I've never experienced as much kill on sight, as I have on the console.Yes. RUST is a survival game, and \"get good\" is the moto today, but even today on the PC you will run into people who do not KoS 99% of the time. You'll even run into people who want to be your neighbor so that you can piggyback each other and make plays.However, the console has a different breed of gamers for the game of RUST. It appears the Fortnite and CoD gang have made RUST their new home.Is the game worth purchasing? Yes, even though as I write this review the console version is lacking the majority of updates that the PC currently has. -1 starHowever, the console RUST community is less forgiving than the PC community. -1 starOverall, this is a good survival game, and it's one of the first in the genre of survival games. It's worth checking out, but just make sure you shoot first, or you'll die often.",

As for the thing itself...well let's say I was a disappointed to say the least. ^^' Streamers playing it make it sound like a really cool survival/building game...and it must probably be...with a lot of real friends. ^^' Game is made extremely hard by most long time players just killing new timers for fun...or whatever. And if you think you can build little by little to become strong enough to survive...think again! Unfortunately, monthly server wipes (doesn't matter if you play on your own server or official ones) will just wipe everything you had except maybe the blueprints of things you collected (since there are no levels or other things to develop your character with. And then everyone starts anew...but without knowing the game well or playing with friends to help you, you'll just end up back at the nearly beginning where you found it so hard to survive. In my opinion, a game best enjoyed by watching others play, so...don't say you weren't warned. ^^",
