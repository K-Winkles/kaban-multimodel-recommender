I asked for my 19 y.o. daughter to put batteries in them before wrapping them up individually to place them as stocking stuffers. 1 box comes with a set of 2 so what I buy for 1 child, I have to buy for the other or they get territorial.My daughter & her 19 y.o. boyfriend each put the batteries in the game and started playing around with it when they were supposed to be wrapping it. Well, I saw how excited they were and they could not stop playing w it. My daughter was envious so guess what, I had to get them a set for stocking stuffers as well.Fast fwd and my niece & nephew brought their games to our family Xmas party and the next thing you know my 28 y.o. cousin & her 32 y.o. fianc\u00e9 are entranced in the game. They are passing it around and everyone wants a piece of it, including me. Geeze.Now I had to buy 2 other sets; 1 for my cousin & her fianc\u00e9 & one for me and my mom who I think would be good for her as she suffered a stroke 2 yrs ago and can only use 1 hand and is slightly delayed in her cognitive skills. I think it would engage her and would be a good exercise tool for her. Meanwhile, my sister is annoyed bc it\u2019s loud AF but you can mute it & still play & follow along bc the keypad lights up.My whole point is that it\u2019s a fun engaging & portable game at any age & at the right price point of $10/game! Yes I probably would end up buying again . So far, the game looks durable enough.BTW, 3 in our family have ADHD.",
