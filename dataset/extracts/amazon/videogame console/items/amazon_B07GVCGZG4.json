                "reviewText": "I have 14 consoles most of which are RCA connections. I went the route of getting the cheaper hdmi scalers to connect to a flat panel tv and the results are just no good. These classic consoles just simply did not look right or good. And on the NES the light gun does not work on panels.So I said forget this. Found a nice 27\u201d CRT TV for free. They just wanted it out of the house. But, I did not have all the original video cables for some of the systems.This fit the bill. Inexpensive and hooked it into a RCA switcher.Glory! Look just like it should. Many games were made using tricks that took advantage of CRT TV design. Plus modern flat panels just make the games fake looking and the scalers introduce a buzz for a lack of a better word to the image.Now yes there are high end scalers at a couple hundred or more dollars but why? Play the console on the displays they were made for!",
