                "reviewText": "I was excited to try this, hoping I could get to play a classic game from my childhood, maybe even a knock-off Nintendo game... But alas, all i got to play were broken games that seem like they made last week using Unity and some sloppy vector art. None of the keys made sense. All the buttons were the right flipper while down on the D-Pad is the left flipper in the terrible pinball game. \"821 Retro Games\"? I only counted 60. I'm very disappointed. Tease me with the SNES looking system only to shove terrible games into it... NOt worth more than $10 imo.",

                "reviewText": "This mock Nintendo NES game system has preloaded games on a mini look alike console. The important thing is to make sure to insert the mini SD card into the back of the console. Otherwise, you are stuck with a poor selection of 60 no-name games. Once the SD is installed, you have over 800. The system of selecting the games is not particularly convenient, and you can scroll one screen at a time with the arrow pad, or skip by 50's or so with the buttons, but then you are missing a lot. One could wish for a way of sorting or searching the games, but in reality there are probably a dozen or so you may want to play for nostalgia sake. The fact that you can't back out of a game to the home menu except by the reset button, is also a little annoying. However, if you find the games you like, the controls and concept is still the same as the classic console. The cords were a little short to reach where we needed, and so the device kept falling. Overall, it's average--a fun throwback, but some simple improvements could really make a better user experience. If you are patient with those, and identify which games you really want to play, it can be fun.",
