I wanted something to travel with for cars and planes, and it does the trick.ButzzzA lot of the games are repeats or weird knockoff versions of games. The buttons are a bit rough and hurt my fingers a bit, so I can\u2019t use this for as long at a time as I had planned.You can\u2019t save progress so I don\u2019t get much progress through the game and end up having to restart it and then get bored of playing the same parts over and over.So. It\u2019ll do for a kid and doesn\u2019t cost a ton of money, but I didn\u2019t get as much of a nostalgia fix as I hoped with this one.",
