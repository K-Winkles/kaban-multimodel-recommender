Can turn the volume all the off if other people are around.. The worst thing is there is no battery indicator. You have know idea when it's full charged or about to die. The screen just gets dim. When a charger is plugged in a red light comes on but that's all it does. I don't know how long the battery will actually last because I never know if I've got it full charged lol.

Very fun and can connect to the TV and also allow for 2 players as well. Well worth the price. About same size as the gameboy color too.",

                "reviewText": "This is basically like a mini gameboy from my childhood except it's much smaller and lighter and it's also in colour! There are quite a few games preloaded onto this handheld console but there are also a lot of repeated games. With 500 games loaded on here (including repeats), it may seem to have every game you could think of but there were a lot of interesting games that seemed \"made up\"? Like for example, there's no such thing as Super Mario Bros 6 (at least I've never heard of it) but the game ends up being a cross between Super Mario Bro and Tiny Toons and it's definitely a playable game but it's just weird. But then you also have the classics that practically all of us have played which is the original Super Mario Bros (and also Super Mario Bros 3) that's also on this console and it plays exactly as I remembered as a kid. Same with Dr. Mario except back then I remember playing it without colour and here there's colour. There are also some newer games such as Angry Birds preloaded on here which was neat. A handheld controller, charging cable, and AV cable are also provided. This would make a fun gift for anyone who grew up in the 80s and 90s as most of the games preloaded on here seem to be from that time. I ended up gifting this to my brother since the gameboy we shared as kids is no longer with us and I thought this would be a nice nostalgic gift for him. He loved it!",
