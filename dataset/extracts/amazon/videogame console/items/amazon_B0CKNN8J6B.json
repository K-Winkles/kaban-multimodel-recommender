Was a little let down on the games I\u2019d have to really go back and count but trust me when I say you are not getting over 620 different games I\u2019m gonna keep it because I don\u2019t want to deal with the hassle of returning it and I figured even if became a paper weight it would still be a cool one just to have.",
