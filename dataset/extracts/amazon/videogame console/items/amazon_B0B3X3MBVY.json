The instructions were a little confusing. You do have to have the device plugged in to a power source for it to work. Also, the little receiver chip must be plugged into the game drive for the controllers to pair with it. After the initial setup, it's now just plug and play.Super Mario, Street Fighter, Ms Pacman, The Simpsons, Final Fantasy and so many more games I played growing up. THE NASTALGIA IS REAL!",

                "reviewText": "Not worth the money whatsoever.Cons:1) Feels very cheaply made2) Bought the 50,000 game version, and there was something around 43,000 games on it.3) Not surprised, but tons games were duplicates from different consoles, and of course tons of sequels.4) Either one of the super-cheap controllers was glitching, or the software itself was, causing the game menu to constantly scroll until you used the d-pad instead of the joysticks.5) Multiple of the few games we got to try, the controllers didn't work for them and we couldn't get through the menu to actually play the game.6) In an hour we managed to try maybe 10 games, because EVERY. SINGLE. GAME would get stuck and even when you could find the correct buttons (which were different for every emulator) to get to the various emulator sub-menus , you still couldn't get out of the sub-menu and back to the main menu. This leaves you with unplugging the device from the wall for a hard reset. Even then, sometimes it would lock up trying to restart and you'd have to do it again. Out of the 10 games we tried, I managed to get back to the game-list once without a hard-boot. Even when I managed that, we had to wait for--what seemed like--the entire OS to boot back up again.Pros:1) the idea was cool until it was implementedOverall: Not worth the money. For the $60 you'd be better to find an old Raspberry Pi and build yourself a little emulator system. I am new to emulators, so maybe the controller issues part is common--I don't know--but you can't enjoy a system when half the games aren't playable and all your doing is wasting time rebooting over and over trying to find a game that will actually work. And rounding up from 43,000 to 50,000 games is inexcusable from a marketing standpoint.",

                "reviewText": "(Original review below) - We had to send back our original product for a replacement. The second item works SO MUCH BETTER!!!! The first one was slow to load games, and this one is NOT. We have not found many games that don't work on this one either. Word to the wise - unplug from the power source after 3 hours or so, the device gets hot, and it WILL fry your TV. It has worked, daily, for a full week now, so regardless of if it breaks again, we've received the rental value. Other games not mentioned in previous review (there are multiple copies/versions of each of these games) - Simcity, Where in the World is Carman Sandiego, Lord of the Rings, Tomb Raider, Resident Evil and so many more. DOWNSIDE - you cannot save progress. You really are taking a trip back in time. If you change to a new game, all progress restarts.(Original Review)Took out of box, plugged in and we were off. Spent hours enjoying Super Mario, Mortal Combat, Zelda, Grand Theft Auto and many other great games. Next day, a random game glitched and screen froze. Unplugged, replugged, now I can't get the power back on... Guess it was fun while it lasted. Have reached out for support, but if they can't fix remotely, I'll have to return and go through the process again, or get a refund. Bummer.",

                "reviewText": "BEWARE - Purchased this game as a birthday gift for my 5 year-old great grandson. He was so excited to receive it! They hooked it up to their 32\" TV and for about an hour everything was just fine - until the controllers started to heat up. He told his mom who immediately freaked out because they were really HOT and she was concerned that he could have burned himself. My granddaughter called me and told me what happened; not only did the controllers overheat, but somehow it carried over to the TV and it must have overheated as well because it blew out. Now the little guy didn't have a game, OR a TV. I called Amazon who told me you were a third party seller and there was no way to actually discuss this with anyone from your company. I proceeded to order another (what I thought was different) game. This description was and corresponding picture were different, and the price was $20 or so more so I figured it was better and would work. I also had to purchase a new TV because the other one no longer worked. So I ordered the new game and when she received it it was EXACTLY the same item - at least inside the box. We thought it might be ok, thinking the first one was just defective. But Nope - after a few minutes of play it started heating up. Needless to say she unplugged everything and called me. I then called Amazon to report what had occurred. This was a different seller so I thought I would have better luck at speaking with someone - apparently there is no way to do so.",
