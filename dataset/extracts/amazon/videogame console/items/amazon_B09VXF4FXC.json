There are sooooo many games listed on the packing list which are not on the actual console. But the biggest disappointment was \"Paperboy\" not being on it. This was the sole reason for the purchase. If a console with only Paperboy and Mario were sent to me, I would honestly give it 5 stars. I AM ABSOLUTELY HEARTBROKEN AND HAVE NO USE FOR THE GAME CONSOLE. IT IS CURRENTLY SITTING ON THE FLOOR IN THE CORNER OF THE BROOM CLOSET. WHAT A WASTE! \ud83d\ude14",
