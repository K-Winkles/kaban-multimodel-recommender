                "reviewText": "Bought for my husband who loves video games. We were blown away by how many fun games it included. This gaming stick has tons of emulators and tons of games! The search function is very useful and you can also bookmark it. Comes with 2 controllers and easy to use. Playing these games really brings you back to the 90s or.. 80s. Super Mario, Donkey Kong, Contra and even \"newer\" games like Crash Bandicoot is included. Lots of fighting games and many imports. Love the portability of this unit! The setup is relatively simple, and while the quality of the game shows off the skill that went into creating this game, the nostalgia is worth the trip down memory lane! If you have a friend or loved one who loves vintage video games, this would be a really fun gift for them!",
