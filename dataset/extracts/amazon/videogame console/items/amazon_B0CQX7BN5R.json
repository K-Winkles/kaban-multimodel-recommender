The picture is terrible, seems to use some kind of onboard AI upscaling tech which just makes everything look bubbly. 50% of the games are repeats and another 20% are exclusively in Japanese. The remaining 30% are unplayable because the onboard hardware isn't strong enough to run a super Nintendo rom without studdering to a rediculous degree. Then the ones that do work as so sped up that you can't play those either cause it's like playing on fast forward. OK maybe I'm being unkind. The fighting games are fine so like 10% of the games are playable. But good luck with the controller cause it's not SNES layout and it's not reprogramable.",
