The screen looks decent, but has a strange glare that almost looks like a green light in front of the screen from certain angles. The buttons feel pretty cheap and are a little crunchy.There is a ton of games divided into 6 different categories. None of the games that I have tried were very good though. With the amount available I am sure there are probably some gems, it just make take some time to find them.Overall I am completely neutral on this item. It is fair for the current price, but I wouldn't recommend it for over $20. If your expectations are set correctly I think you will be happy with it.",

                "reviewText": "These retro handheld video game consoles have gotten so ridiculously inexpensive we decided to order a few different ones to compare them. This one intrigued my 5 year old daughter the most because, it's pink!This retro hand held has a nice variety of classic games, and some I've never heard of, something for everyone for sure. For anyone that's played around with these retro mods, you get that there can be controller mapping issues, trial and error to controller operation that may be different for each game, some games may not even work, or whatnot, all quirks of these setups. This one seems to work pretty well. Haven't found any \"dead\" games yet, and they play nice once you figure out the controller mapping.My five year old is having a blast with it. This one gets props for using (and including) a rechargeable battery, along with a USB charging cable. It has a decent color screen, for the price [especially with the coupon!] this a bargain in my opinion!",

The most important part, however, is how well it entertains my little girl. She loves playing games but the games on this device were very hard to maneuver or figure out. Part of the problem is that the controls are not as responsive. Another part is that you don't see how to play the game. You just play and hope you end up doing something right.She ended up losing interest because she couldn't find a clear goal that she could achieve in the games she tried out. There are many games though so maybe there were better ones that she just didn't get through yet.I gave it 3 out of 5 because overall, it just didn't work for what we wanted. It's a very nice concept though and may work fine for somebody else.",

                "reviewText": "This is a fun little gaming device which includes games mostly from the 90's. They are not going to be main title games but a lot of them will be familiar when looking at that generation.There's a set of classics and mostly they are 2d games (runners/asteroids/etc style). The categories are well sorted between shooters to adventure/puzzle games. Navigating the menu system is straight forward, but nothing tells you that per category there are multiple pages, use the left/right to page.In terms of controls it's a reasonable setup. The left hand has essentially 2 d-pads that do the same thing, one just looks like a stick. The right has the typical buttons which for most games only one or two are used. There very much is a learning curve per game to figure out the controls which can be frustrating as there's no help or hints.My 10yr old loves to pick this up randomly to play games. He never asked for any kind of help on how to operate it so I presume the controls are intuitive enough to him coming from using a xbox style game controller.So far the battery has lasted several hours without needing to be recharged. It uses what looks like an old Nokia battery style (BL-5C) which is replaceable and purchasable via Amazon with a simple search.If you're looking for a low cost entertainment solution for a road trip/etc this would work very well for that.NOTE: The headphone jack that you see in the description pictures is not for headphones. This is for a TV out which no cable is provided. There are no headphone jacks",

                "reviewText": "This was the perfect starter handheld game console for kids. As a family of gamers, we wanted something for my niece who wants to play games, that wouldn't break easily. This was perfect - having tons of games but also durable and still a great price if something were to happen and we need to replace.",

                "reviewText": "This is a really nice way to entertain children when on a long road drive or in a doctors office waiting room. With tons of games, soft feel control, volume control, and easy button access this game will keep your child busy for as long as it takes. It comes with its own rechargeable battery that take about an hour to fully charge by last pretty much all day. It comes with a manual for instructions and a pretty short charging cable. There is no charging block with this game.Yes, I\u2019d recommend this game for toddlers from 2 up to children maybe 5 to 7 years of age. It\u2019s an awesome game and gift idea.",

                "reviewText": "I gave this to my nephew as a Christmas gift and he is obsessed with it. Perfect for a 6 year old because the old-school games are simple and so much easier to learn than today's modern xbox or PS games. His mom said it's fabulous at the dinner table while they're waiting for food, or as a 'you get 30 minutes' treat on a rainy day. Highly recommend for elementary school kid who wants a device but is too young for a phone or a full system.",
