                "reviewText": "[Update: As I write this update, the descriptions of the emulator have been changed to say that it includes \"117000+\" games.\" I'm pretty sure this number is most likely an error, as the price is the same as the price for the emulator *I* ordered ($94.95), and the GB size is also listed as being the same (256GB). I figure this is probably the same emulator I bought, which is much smaller. An emulator with \"117000+\" games would probably be much more expensive!][Another update: I made some additions to this review on Nov. 2, '23; I've placed those additions in curly brackets. I apologize for making the review so much longer than it already was, but REALLY felt the need to make those additions!]Gaming Nirvana here!!I grew up in the '80s and '90s playing video games, mostly on NES and SNES, but also on many other platforms, such as Game Boy, SMS, Genesis (my brother's Genesis, that is!), Saturn (how come it doesn't seem to be on any emulators? It's not on any as far as I know, anyway!), N64, and even Atari 2600, which was the first console I ever had --- and which first came out a few years before I was born! (I'd say that ultimately, Nintendo ended up getting most of my pre-adult gaming attention.) This emulator has most if not all of my old favorite games --- maybe even most of the games I ever played as a kid (excluding the Sega Saturn ones) --- and so, so, SOOOO many more that I'd never (and in most cases, still haven't) played!!However, while this emulator does have tons of games, it doesn't necessarily have as many as the descriptions of it claim; how many are on it kind of depends on how you look at it (see below).The included controllers seem to me to be pretty sturdy and of good overall quality. Other people may have had different experiences with these controllers, but in mine, they have, so far, worked almost perfectly --- connecting them can be quirky, but other than that, I don't really have any issues with them.As for the games: Along with the \"complete,\" originally released versions that people are probably most familiar with, there are also many \"Beta\" or \"proto\" versions here, along with \"revisions\" and hacks. There are many games (and versions thereof) that didn't see the light of day when they were first made; some were never finished. There are lots of \"multiples\" of games (that is, different \"original\" releases [U.S., U.K., Japan, etc.] of the same games). {Also, many if not most of the arcade games appear multiple times in apparently the same versions/releases.} And of course, as with probably any emulator, you may find some games that just don't work, or that don't work correctly. But so far, from what I've experienced, there fortunately doesn't seem to be too many of those here.{After having owned the emulator for close to a year and a half, I HAVE come across a considerable number of games that don't work, or not correctly, but the number of games that DO work properly (or close enough to it) still seems to me to be MUCH greater than the number of ones that don't. Of course, since there are SO VERY many games on the emulator, and since not everyone is interested in all of the same systems, games, etc., probably not everyone is going to encounter ALL of the same non-functional or not-properly-functional games. I know from MY experience that some of the arcade games run but run slowly and/or have messed-up music/and or sound effects; while they are still playable, it may be annoying to try to play them, or some of them, at the slowed-down speeds.}There are many games that were not released in the U.S. or the U.K., and don't appear in English (or at least not entirely in English). For certain games, being in a foreign language may not matter too much (if really at all), but with other ones (such as ones that are largely or even entirely text-based and are mostly or entirely in Japanese), it could make them virtually impossible to play (correctly, anyway). Still, you should be able to find PLENTY of different games in English (or that are enough in English) to play --- and that you can play with regular controllers (again, see below)!One cool feature of this emulator is that it has a printed description and/or history for nearly every game (from what I've seen, anyway). Also from what I've seen, the majority of the descriptions/histories seem to be in English. {The English isn't always completely \"proper,\" though!} (However, with \"Beta,\" etc. versions, they tend to be the same as for the \"originally released\" ones; also, the ones for the different originally released versions tend to be the same, which means that the game titles in them, and sometimes other details, are incorrect for some versions. There are some descriptions/histories that just trail off for some reason.) The emulator doesn't have box art or screenshots or videos for every game (though it seems most games at least have screenshots), but who cares? Well, I guess some people do, but for me it's no problem.From what I've seen, the majority of the games are not full-screen, which for me isn't a major problem (or at least it hasn't been one yet), although on some games, parts of the on-screen \"information\" (like text, timers, numbers of lives, etc.) are at least partly out of the playing field so that you can't see them (or not entirely), and, for the games for some of the handheld systems (like the Game Boys), the playing field is kind of small.Something that's a little confusing is that the emulator itself says to press the 'A' button to enter a game list or a game, and to press 'B' to exit a game list, but actually, you have to press the opposite button from the one it says to press. (At least, this is how it works with the default controller settings.) I don't know if any of the other buttons and instructions are mixed up or not. {Some of them ARE!}Also, some games seem to require players to use a particular one of the controllers to play and/or exit the game (which is done by holding down Start and pressing Select twice). If the controller you're using isn't working (if it isn't making anything happen in the game and/or if you can't seem to exit the game), try the other one. (By the way, to \"insert coins\" into arcade games, press Select. You may have to press other buttons as well as, or instead of, Start to start some other games as well.){There are actually three lists, or \"categories,\" under which the arcade games appear (Arcade, MAME, and Final Burn Neo); many if not most of the games appear in two or even all three of them, seemingly in identical forms, and strangely, some of the games work properly in at least one of the categories they appear under, but DON'T work under the others. I found at least one particular game that had messed-up sound in one of the categories I played it under, but that seemed to work fine in the other category I played it under.}Something that takes (or that COULD take) the number of games on this emulator down even further for people (as it does for me) is that many games originally required a keyboard, and some required some other type of peripheral, and those games don't seem to be playable with \"regular\" controllers here. But fortunately, there are still loads of games that ARE! {Actually, you can bring up a \"virtual keyboard\" for at least some of the keyboard games, but it seems to me that it would be difficult to play them using it!}I'm probably not going to try to remove anything that's already here on this emulator, or to add anything that isn't, because the emulator is probably \"complete\" enough for me as it is. Even with all the stuff here that I'm not really interested in, there's already a LOT more games that I already like (which I have or haven't played on here yet), and that I've never played but that look and sound to me like they might be cool, than I'll be able to play any time soon --- heck, I probably won't get time to play all of them EVER!I would say that overall, this emulator is pretty awesome! WELL worth the price! Compared to $500+ for a \"current\" or \"next-gen\" game console, 95 bucks or so for THIS bad boy is almost a steal, in my opinion, even with its quirks and drawbacks! {The price had even dropped a little the last time I noticed it!} This is a great way to take a trip back to the \"good old days\" of video games, the days before the curse of codes and DLC was unleashed upon the gaming world!",

                "reviewText": "Buyer Beware!!!I ordered one of these last week. It worked for a day and then went to a frozen green screen on the startup. I tried restarting, unplugging and plugging back in multiple times but it still kept freezing before I could even make it to the main menu. So I ordered a replacement and guess what??? Worked for a day and then started freezing again. Two consoles in a row were defective for me, that tells me this console is a SCAM!!!! Maybe there have been a few lucky buyers who received working consoles, but I was not one of them. TWO IN A ROW did not work for me. Don't take the risk. Use your money on a different emulator for classic games. This one is an absolute piece of junk and you will probably be upset if/when yours stops working. This item needs to be removed from Amazon ASAP.",

                "reviewText": "For the price it is definitely worth it especially for the nes,snes, and genesis games which run perfectly. Of course it's not without it's flaws. Ps1 games often don't have music, some dreamcast games have bad digital breakup. Otherwise it is absolutely worth the money with tons of games to play. If you grew up playing the older systems it will give you the taste or nostalgia you are looking for.",

No I don't care what YouTube says or the videos that you watch they are not worth it maybe if they were 50 instead of a hundred then maybe! Yes it has a lot of games on it but a lot of them do not work! Especially the Sega Dreamcast section! I don't care what they tell you or try to sell you these boxes are all the same! They're not designed to run video games! So buy at your own risk good luck!",
