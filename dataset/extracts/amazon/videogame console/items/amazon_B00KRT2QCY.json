I am bummed out cause i can't hook this xbox up to my laptop(internet connection issues) cause i was gonna do some recordings of me play a few games. I noticed that a few of my games do tend to glitch every so often especially 1 game that i have no choice but to skip alot of cutscenes or my xbox will freeze up and after a few minutes of seeing if it will bounce back and me continue playing as usual it will stay frozen leaing me to unhook my xbox for a few minutes then rehook it and replay what i just did. A certain sound it makes when it is about to freeze/glitch up. I need to upgrade someday to an xbox one console but until that time i am stuck with this console.",

                "reviewText": "So after dealing with gamestop used and renewed products, my hopes wasn'thigh for this xbox. Opened the box to see everything individually wrapped in bubble wrap, after removing the wrapping I noticed the systems itself was in amazing condition for its age. No cracks or deep scratches, and no broken plastic trim pieces. Came with power inverter and cord, new Amazon basics hdmi cable, controler is used but tight enough for me, even 2 new AA batteries. What really surprised me is seeing a 250gb internal HDD already inside the system after seeing reviews stating theirs came without one. So far everything's great the first day, so if you're on the fence about buying used systems, just roll the dice and see what you get. Worst comes to worst it's a POS or missing parts and you send it back.",

We were amazed at the condition when it arrived since it looked like it was brand new out of the box!!We had only expected to receive the Xbox gaming system as listing described but much to our surprise and delight it also arrived with 2 wireless controllers, and a bunch of games that were some of my sons absolute favorites in completely like new condition (there was one that had like 2 marks on the disk but they weren\u2019t scratches)!! I want to say there may have been a couple of other things in there my son was excited to see since he had expected to have to go buy.I waited a few months before reviewing to make sure everything kept working and it wasn\u2019t just a pretty package and it\u2019s still operating like new!!Highly recommend this seller!Arrived super quick, packaged well, and I will happily buy from again!",
