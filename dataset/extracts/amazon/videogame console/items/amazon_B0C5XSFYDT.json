Though I took a risk and the item came in 2 days based off my prime shipping it also comes with a charger I just did not add it in picture. The games have all worked as far as I\u2019ve tried. I have had the device for about 2 weeks now and it\u2019s pretty fun playing all the different types of games. The only thing I will complain about is the fact that the first few days of playing it the battery life was very short and only lasted about like an hour or 2 but then after less than a week I\u2019ve been playing on it here and there and the battery has not drained at all. So now I believe it does last at least a good bit of hours. Good product if you miss playing retro games and fun to play with if you\u2019re just bored in general.",

Alot I'm not familiar with but already have probably 40-50 hours of playtime in. I will say the '10,000 games' mark might be true if you speak numerous languages lol. But still a crapload of USA and english translated games. FYI if you're looking for specific games you don't get with the unit, don't worry. There's a ton of support online and sites to visit to download almost anything you can think of if you want. 100% recommend buying if you're a 90s kid or older, looking to rekindle childhood memories and have infinite hours of fun. I'm not a YouTuber or paid to say this, just a guy who grew up with gameboys and nintendo,sega,Playstation,etc.Also (sorry) some reviews say you can't save your game (pokemon, RPGs, etc.) You can through the RetroArch menu. Just have to play around a bit and learn how it works. But again, tons of support online if you have questions or need tutorials!",

                "reviewText": "It delivers on what it claims, many many retro games in an affordable handheld device.Decent battery life & screen. Buttons responsive & hardware is good quality. No surprises at this price point.However, no bluetooth. Really? In this point of technology, BT not included seems odd.Also, organization of game titles, not great. Some games have several different versions, often just different languages, they count them as distinct titles. So 10,000 games is more like 3,000 in your supported language. They could put in a language filter, wouldnt be too hard.Titles can be very long, they fall off edge of screen and cannot be read. Word Wrap, Miyoo. Word. Wrap!Form factor: Way too small. Could have crammed in more battery or screen for a more reasonable, adult hands sized frame. But they opted for tiny box hand held. They did not think it through.For those minor deficiencies, 4 / 5 stars on this one.If GB was your thing back in the day, Welcome home, this will do nicely to cure your retro fix.Update: battery life is not great at most,1.5 hrs, you\u2019d be lucky to see more than that. Will do more testing as I play it but so far not living up to the hype",

And I\u2019ll say, this system was exactly what I wanted and it came next day. It\u2019s worth the extra few bucks rather than waiting weeks for an over seas shipment.For those of you who are not familiar with the miyoo mini+, this compact, beautiful emulator can play the majority of all of your nostalgia games. This device comes preloaded with 5000+ games, which makes it easy to play straight out of the box. Or you can get fancy and update the software to Onion Os and download even more game depending on the size of your sd card.This device is quality.",

The SD card is cheap and filled with corrupted paths within. If I knew better, I should\u2019nt have purchased the 128GB version and just got the cheapest one. I feel that I was scammed, as none of the games work. On the bright side, the console itself is customizable and very intuitive. It will take you sometime to get it the way you like, but do not buy the 128GB version, It a waste of money.",
