                "reviewText": "This isn\u2019t a legit product in any way. It\u2019s super bootleg like you would find at a drugstore.Okay putting that aside it\u2019s pretty neat. I bought it for my 6 year old to play in the car. He loves it.It charges with a micro usb connector from a standard phone charger. There is no charge indicator so just plug it in for 3 hours and it should be full. We charge it after every 2-3 hours he uses it but not because it\u2019s really needed, it\u2019s just to be safe because we can\u2019t tell the charge level.The screen is decent and the sound is okay. It gets pretty loud. Haven\u2019t tested headphones or anything else with it. It\u2019s mainly a car toy or for use when we are out to dinner. It\u2019s small and easy to toss in a pocket or bag.Look it\u2019s a neat trip down memory lane but that\u2019s it. It\u2019s one of those buy it and toss it if it breaks. You can have fun with it but it won\u2019t break the bank if it dies in a year. Don\u2019t expect full blown $300 game console quality.",

The biggest issue I have, thus far, is the number of games uploaded. There are not 400 games. If you hold down the down arrow it takes you to the end of the list where you start seeing games repeated. Keep that in mind. For the price, I think it\u2019s a good little gadget for my kids.",

I'm not sure if it really has 400 games as a few seem to be listed several times, but I haven't yet been through the entire catalog and played them to see differences. The ones I have played worked as they should. My only real complaint is that the progress doesn't save.",
