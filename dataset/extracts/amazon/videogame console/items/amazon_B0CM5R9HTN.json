                "reviewText": "This retro unit is pretty fun. The games do repeat, but there are still plenty to choose from.It hooks up to the tv easily and has a wired controller, so it's a lot of fun to pass around and take turns with. The settings and games don't save, so it's a restart each time. Not really a big deal when considering the very low price of this console and that only hardcore retro gamers are really going to want to play for endless amounts of time, so they'd know to buy a fancier setup.For me, I'm going to pick up a box tv and create a retro gaming area in our gaming room, as I have another old school gaming console that could use an older tv to really shine.This looks like a gameboy, so makes me feel some nostalgia when I see it. I've really enjoyed playing the games from my childhood/youth, because I'm actually good at a lot of those, whereas a lot of the newer games just have too many buttons/menus/etc for me to immerse myself in them and just play for fun.I'd recommend this for any age. I think that kids and teens would get a kick out of it, plus you could tell them how you used to have to walk to school every day, uphill both ways, in the snow, lol. Adults will have fun playing the games from the childhood.",

                "reviewText": "PROs:- Takes you back to the past with some classic games.- Allows you to play some classic games you might have missed as a kid.- Cheap entertainment. You will get your 15-20 dollars worth.- Plugging into the TV is cool but not practical for long periods.CONs:- At this price point, the overall build quality and battery life are not great.- No save options. Better be ready to binge near a power source if you want to see the ending to your favorite game.- D Pad does not work consistently.- Screen is not good on the eyes.Overall, I would recommend this to someone who wants a cheap and temporary trip down memory lane. Or someone wanting to introduce classics to their kids who won\u2019t have an attention span that is bothered by no save options. Also, when it breaks, and it will, you won\u2019t be terribly upset about the 15-20 dollar investment. I have been to fairs that want to charge hundreds for held-held devices to help people dip their toes in the waters of nostalgia.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Trovono Retro Handheld Game Console and I have to say, it has been one of the best investments I've made in a while. With 500 classic FC games, I've found myself spending countless hours reliving my childhood memories of playing these games with my friends. The 3.0-inch screen is the perfect size and the graphics are surprisingly clear and crisp.One of the standout features for me is the ability to connect the console to my TV, which makes it perfect for playing with friends or family. The rechargeable battery also lasts a decent amount of time, so I don't have to worry about constantly charging it.The design of the console is sleek and stylish, and the controls are easy to use. I also love that it supports two players, so I can enjoy the games with a friend.Overall, I highly recommend the Trovono Retro Handheld Game Console to anyone who loves classic gaming and wants to take a trip down memory lane.",
