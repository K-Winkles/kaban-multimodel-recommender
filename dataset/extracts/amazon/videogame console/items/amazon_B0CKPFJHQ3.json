The navigation was tricky at first to get back to the original screen after selecting the game but after a while, I was able to go back to the original screen with no problems. All the games that I have tried worked well. I\u2019m surprised at some of the Capcom fighting games play very well with no lag. It\u2019s kind of crazy to think that with the older councils they were struggling so hard to put arcade games over without enough RAM or graphics being removed is so many games to play in to name on here. Just know that if you played video games since the late 70\u2019s , up to the end of the 2010. The game is more likely to be there, and it plays almost arcade part. I not only recommend this, but I will be purchasing several more.",

                "reviewText": "I have spent a lot of time trying out this 2nd generation game stick and I gotta say - really like it. It doesn\u2019t seem like much out of the box, just a small stick and two wireless controllers, but it turns out that is all you need to play a ton of fun games. You simply plug the stick into a tv or monitor via HDMI cable and then plug the other end into an outlet. The two controllers need 2 AAA batteries each, and then there is a switch on the underside of each controller to turn it on. The controllers are PlayStation 2 style, and a little on the cheap side, but they do work well for playing all these games. I didn\u2019t have any trouble with them, but I do wonder how long they will last. They can be replaced with other wireless controllers, but you do need the controller that has a wireless USB plug. As far as the games go, this system comes with emulators for the Famicon, gameboy, MAME, PlayStation, snes, genesis, and Atari. Everything seems to play very well except for the PlayStation emulator. This one runs games very slowly and it is actually quite hilarious to hear the voices in the games playing deep and slow. I\u2019m not sure why the PlayStation was included because the games are basically unplayable. Everything else seems to run very well, the only real real glitch I see is the often the title screen music for games does not play. There are thousands of games loaded into this stick and a vast majority of them play just fine. My only complaint is that the navigator is a bit cumbersome to use. You have to scroll forever sometimes to get to the game you want to play. Since all the titles are alphabetized, it can take a long time to scroll to the game if it is in the middle of the pack. There is also multiple copies of many games that are for different languages and regions. This adds to the scrolling, and hopefully I can figure out the correct way to remove unwanted titles. On a positive note, when you download a game and then quit out, it takes you back to the screen you last left on, which is very nice. Overall, I am very impressed with how much fun I am having with this system. There is a great selection of nes, snes, and genesis games to keep you busy forever. I love the portability of this game stick and the wireless controllers really add to the replay value. If you are looking for a nice portable device to play emulated games, I would recommend this one.",
