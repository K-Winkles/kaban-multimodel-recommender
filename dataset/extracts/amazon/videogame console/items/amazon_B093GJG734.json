Second, retro games often encourage cooperation and teamwork. This can help to build communication and problem-solving skills, as well as create lasting memories. In addition to the benefits listed above, retro games can also help to reduce screen time and encourage physical activity. Many retro games require players to get up and move around, which can be a welcome break from the sedentary lifestyle that many people lead today. Finally, retro games can simply be a lot of fun! They can provide a welcome escape from the stresses of everyday life and bring families together in a shared experience of laughter and joy.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Best Mini NES!",
                "reviewText": "Inside the box; One mini Nintendo console. 1 HDMI hookup cable. 1 Micro USB power supply (USA plug). 2 Controllers (9 pin). 1 Micro SD card (256MB). And 1 Manual (No Games List.)There is 44.2MB free of 239MB on the Micro SD card. The 7 folders within the card are listed as; Action, Puzzle, Racing, Resources, Roms, Shoot, and Sport. Each folder has a save folder inside, excluding the Resources folder. All of the games are ZFC files, except for the ones in the Roms folder, which is where you can add more games. So, if you have a desktop full of .NES files like me, you can add those here. Just make sure you have enough available space on the TF card before doing so. If your PC doesn't have a TF (SD) card reader, you can pick up a cheap card reader on Amazon for about $8 dollars. I used a Uni USB C Memory Card Reader Adapter that Supports SD/Micro SD/SDHC/SDXC/MMC, which is about $15, but I had that lying around for my phone.To save your game, simply hit the Start and Select button at the same time on your controller. This will bring up a menu where you can save games, load saved games, quit the game, adjust your screen resolution, and change the system from NTSC to PAL. The reset button on the console will take you back to the folder you were previously in.All games are listed by category and are in alphabetical order. You can use the left/right button on the D-Pad to quickly sift through the games to find what you want. I haven't seen any repeat games on the console, but there are some buggy ones. EG; Increased music speed in Super Mario games, and clipping in a few others, but they are still very playable, and the music speed can be fixed by simply adding your own ROM of the same game. At least, for me, it was fixed. By the way, I used No-Intro .NES games. You can find them easily with Google search.All in all, this is a nice little system that brings back great memories. It has almost every game you are looking for, and if it doesn't, you can add them! Not to mention, you can save your game progress, even for the ones you added. Oh, and if the cords for the controller and HDMI hookup are a tad short for your liking, you can buy extensions.Over all, I highly recommend this item if you are looking for something similar to the NES that has TF (SD card) support, save game functions, and doesn't cost an arm and a leg. Don't waste your time browsing through 400 duplicate games. Just get this! Seller is amazing too.",

She was super excited about all the games on here and couldn't wait to dive in and start playing - in fact, the only ones more excited were her mom and dad and I, since these are the games WE grew up playing. We had a great time that afternoon showing her all of our favorite games from our childhood.Games are organized into categories: shooting games, puzzle games, etc. It would be nice if it came with a printed list of games, but they are in alphabetical order under each category so games are pretty easy to find. And while I haven't looked at the entire roster of games on here, you're not going to find each game repeated 100 times like you will with the ones that advertise \"100,000 games.\" The controllers seem sturdy enough, and it's super easy to hook up. We were playing maybe three minutes after opening the box.For an after-market product, this one is worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted the Retro Nintendo mini bc I travel a lot with my kids. Great system. Has lots of games although some of the games have typos In the names which is kind of funny but the games are good. Lots of old school games. Very few games that aren\u2019t included. I like that it has room on the hard drive to add stuff. Don\u2019t like that the game cord is so short though. Had to buy extension so it could reach across to the bed. Sometimes the controllers lag a little which I don\u2019t love but I find it only happens occasionally. (This is before I bought the extender so I know it\u2019s not bc of that). Great set. The $300 version only came with like 20 games so\u2026. Way better value!",

                "reviewText": "While this game box has hundreds ofoptions most of them I've never even heard of and the ones I have (with different mashes cuz they're knock offs, of course) are barely playable. Pac Man 2 \" Ms PacMan like\" is the best IMHO, but even so the controls are slow to respond and half the time it didn't turn when you direct it to.There version of Super Mario Bros is so pathetic it's not even worth playing. (Can't even go backwards on the screen for example) and again, the control isn't very responsive.I'll be returning this whole thing but thought I'd warn others to save your money. It makes me miss Atari or early Nintendo games, but does not even remotely (pun intended) scratch the itch to play them again!",
