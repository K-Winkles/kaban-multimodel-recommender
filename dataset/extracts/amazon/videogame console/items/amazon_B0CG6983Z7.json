                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is a system that appeals to the old school gamers the most, but could also appeal to kids who are open minded and not obsessed with the latest and greatest. The library is MASSIVE! Especially for such a little device. My guess is there are 6000+ games on here, the game libraries are pretty well flushed out and it is probably above that number. These are games from all of the old systems, up until the early 2000, mind you the most graphically advanced are probably the GBC games but I haven\u2019t even explored this thing fully so I could be wrong. I was surprised at the amount of RPG games, as well as shooters.The system itself is light weight, so I would make sure not to drop it, but it survived a 4 foot fall and did fine. It has a very square shape and the controls are responsive and what you expect. The battery can be a bit laggy while charging, but once it\u2019s charged, man oh man, it can last awhile, full brightness was 4 hours, but that was with a third of the battery charged on the first usage. I turned it down to half brightness and got a 8 hr run out of it(over 5-6 days) usually 2ish hours at a time. The screen is plenty bright and has a nostalgic type of vibe for myself. You could hook it to a TV, I would probably find it awkward, but it\u2019s something you could do. The sound gets quite loud, but lacks Bass, meh, I personally don\u2019t care about that with bit music and soundtracks. It does have a feature where you could add different music to it and comes with a couple songs. I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s what the card reader is for. Anyways I think it\u2019s lovely for my old school gaming needs.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great device to get your fix of some old favorite games.The games run well and you can easily find other games on the Internet and copy them to the included SD card, like the Super Mario Bros. series.The games are named so weirdly though and start with a number.I recommended putting the SD card in a computer, find your favorite games and rename them without the leading numbers so then you can browse them in alphabetical order.Then move all the remaining numbered ones you don't care about to another folder.Alternatively, there are ways to rename many files at once following a pattern. Search the Internet.It is a little cheap feeling and I'm not sure how long the controls with last. It is not very comfortable for long gaming sessions because of the non-ergonomic shape.It has options for an external controller and video out (which no modern TVs have so you would need to buy an adapter too). There are likely better options out there for big screen nostalgic gaming, but I didn't look. Like I said, this is nice to get your fix, but not for serious gamers.",

                "reviewText": "There doesn't seem to be any oversight about what is on this game console.The main screen set up is very outdated and when you go back to the titles, you have to start at the beginning of the list so it's hard to get all the way to the bottom eventually.The game play is alright, but there are so many titles that you can't possibly play/read all of them in a reasonable amount of time.We just happened to find some hidden things that maybe should not be there...for example, there is a game called the Little Mermaid, but there is also one called The Little Naked Girl or something which is the exact same game as The Little Mermaid- BUT all the characters are naked?!Who knows how many of these types of games there are, I couldn't get though all the games.I thought it was very weird. I don't know if Amazon goes through items like this, maybe they should or put some kind of disclaimer that these are random downloads that can portray anything.",

                "reviewText": "Let me tell you, this Handheld Retro Game Console is quite the marvel. It's proven its mettle with nearly every game I've thrown at it. It also has a multimedia emulator console that allows you to watch movies/music. As for the Battery, I'd rate it as reasonably decent and can last more than 6 hours to let you play enough at once. The screen is also very nice.",
