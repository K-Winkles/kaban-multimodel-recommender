As the day was coming to a close and grandson was looking for some chill time, he played with this and enjoyed all of the old games. He tried several of the games and enjoyed them a lot. The unit was easy for him to handle and seemed to be sized just right.He already has a Nintendo switch, and I wasn't sure this unit would interest him, but there was a great assortment of games included with this unit, and he seemed absorbed by some of the old style games (Mario, anyone?).I looked over his shoulder for a few minutes and the screen seemed more than adequate for playing, and the response time was pretty good. All in all, I would recommend this console for someone who likes a variety of games, or the nostalgia of playing old games in a very portable device.",

There is no directions, you don't know what the object of each game is. The game just starts and you have to figure it out. I put it away, not sure but I think it will just frustrate them. The grandkids are ages 7, 5 & 4. I think I will wait till the snow falls and we need a project. It is hand size and easy to hold and push the buttons. I probably should have returned it.",
