Slow to load, sometimes taking up to an hour in some cases2. Wouldn\u2019t open at all.I followed all of the instructions from the product manual but I wasn\u2019t able enough to get things running. I have also tried contact their customer service about this and haven\u2019t heard anything. It\u2019s a bummer because this thing seemed really cool but in theory but in practice\u2026.not so much!",

                "reviewText": "When I ordered this I honestly did not know what to expect. After ordering I realized that my laptop was too old to run this. So I bought a used Dell optiplex i7 7700 micro computer to run it on. Now I have not touched a computer since 2010 prior to this. I'm stating this because it should tell you how easy it is to get up and running. At first I wasn't sure what to do because it does not come with a physical copy of instructions. The first thing I did was scan the drive for any viruses. My scan produced nothing....it gave me the all clear. There are 3 separate files to scan. One is a \"install first\" file and the other 2 are the 2 different game systems. Anyhow there is also a small file with brief instructions on what to do to get things going. You have to install the \"install first\" file or batocera will not start. The install first file contains direct x and will fix and add the proper files and extensions you need to run the game systems. When you open the install file scroll down to the direct x file with application written next to it. Open that and follow instructions. Once this is done you can now open retrobat and playnite. To open retrobat click on its file folder and scroll way down until you see retrobat with application written next to it and double click that and your up and running. Its the same process for playnite. Drop and drag a shortcut of retrobat and playnite to your home screen and your all set and can access like any other application you have. Now for the games. All I'm going to say is that if your not happy with what's on this drive your not going to ever be happy....period! The game selection is outstanding! The computer I'm using is running everything I have tried with no problems. Just get a couple x box 360 controllers and a keyboard and mouse and your all set. The ps2 games alone make this a tremendous value. They are fantastic!!! Trust me.",

                "reviewText": "Out of the box, wasn't too sure what I was expecting. The unit arrived in a very small box with a tiny hard drive and a strange cable that I doubt many have laying around. The cable that came with it is extremely short and is pretty much made to sit on top of your desktop.Starting it up was easy as pie, plug it in, open the device and you're greeted with tons of folders, emulators you've never heard of and roms foreign and domestic. In the folders youll have a folder labeled 'install' first and the exe is DirectX repair, I did not install this exe but was still able to boot up the emulator and rons.One thing I wish I knew this beforehand but if you don't have a PC gaming pad, 60-70% of the games are unplayable -- can't really complain cause there's SO many titles on here.There's some more recent games in the play nite folder which has some reaaally good ones. I have had rooms freeze on my multiple times and stop responding within my 3 hours going through and playing some games.All and all for the price, it's great. It has everything you could possibly think of and more. The emulator isn't 100% user friendly and some rooms are hit or miss but overall I'm satisfied with what's here.It's a buy for the retro games, many games work with just a keyboard and there IS options to map out buttons or to simply map your keyboard BUT my key takeaway is to own a PC compatible controller.",
