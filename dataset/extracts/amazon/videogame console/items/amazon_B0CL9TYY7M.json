                "reviewText": "Got this controller in early this morning, and it's excellent. I use a controller on my PC mostly for racing games and platformers. I played several hours of Forza on it today, as well as Ebenezer and the Invisible World (a metroidvania-style platformer) and the controller performed flawlessly. To understand why this is such a big deal to me, this is the 4th or 5th wireless controller I've tried over the past 6 or so months, and the others always had some annoying drawback or defect that caused me to return them. Either the buttons were too stiff, the joystick inputs got stuck in a direction and wouldn't release, or the buttons would map weird in Windows. It was always something. One even malfunctioned after a whole 3 hours of using it, and that one was much more expensive than the SMX. The SMX also doesn't have the annoying M buttons on the back of it. I know those are useful for some people but I absolutely hate those and was glad to see this controller didn't have them. The SMX also feels comfortable to use over long gaming sessions.Long story short: As long as this controller holds up over time, it is my new go-to for a wireless controller, as I haven't found a single thing about it I don't like. I plan to buy another for my other PC.",

                "reviewText": "This controller offers great value for its price and compatibility with various gaming systems. Although it has an old school Xbox One style, it can be used on the Switch, PC, and Steam Deck, thanks to its Bluetooth connection support.An added advantage is that when using this controller on Steam or Steam Deck, you can customize the button functionality to mimic the layout of an Xbox controller, where A acts as B and B as A.The hall effect triggers are a nice touch as you can determine when and how you want to activate the trigger commands in game.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars A Decent Choice",
                "reviewText": "I recently tried out the Wireless PC Game Controller with High Accuracy Hall Triggers, and while it has some positive aspects, it falls short in a few key areas.Wireless Connectivity: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 (4/5)The wireless connectivity of this controller is fairly reliable. It connects seamlessly to my PC, and I experienced minimal input lag during gameplay. The freedom of movement without being tethered to the computer is a definite plus, and I appreciate the convenience of wireless gaming.High Accuracy Hall Triggers: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 (4/5)The inclusion of High Accuracy Hall Triggers is a notable feature, enhancing the precision of in-game actions. The triggers respond well, providing a satisfying level of control during gameplay. This is particularly beneficial for genres that require quick and accurate trigger actions.Ergonomics: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 (3/5)While the controller is generally comfortable to hold, the ergonomics are not outstanding. After extended gaming sessions, I found my hands feeling a bit fatigued. The placement of buttons and the overall design could be improved for a more comfortable and natural grip.Build Quality: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 (3/5)The build quality is satisfactory, but it doesn't feel as robust as some other controllers on the market. The plastic construction feels a bit lightweight, and there's a noticeable lack of heft that some gamers might associate with premium controllers. It's decent for casual gaming but may not withstand heavy use.Battery Life: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 (3/5)The battery life is adequate, providing a decent amount of playtime before needing a recharge. However, it doesn't quite match up to the longevity offered by some competitors. It would be more convenient if the battery life were extended, reducing the frequency of recharging.Compatibility: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 (3/5)While the controller works well with most PC games, it may not be as universally compatible as some other controllers on the market. Some users might encounter issues with certain titles, and additional software updates may be needed for optimal performance.Conclusion:In conclusion, the Wireless PC Game Controller with High Accuracy Hall Triggers is a decent option for gamers seeking a wireless solution with enhanced trigger precision. It offers reliable connectivity and performs well in most gaming scenarios. However, the lackluster build quality, average ergonomics, and slightly below-par battery life prevent it from standing out in a crowded market. If you're in need of an affordable wireless controller with decent performance, this could be a suitable choice, but there are more compelling options available in the same price range.",

                "reviewText": "Looks and feels great. The back of the grips are not textured but completely smooth. I would have preferred to have the back of the grips to be textured. I find it's easier to hold. It's not a deal breaker to me.Every button is easy to press down and they feel good. The A, B, X, and Y buttons feel very responsive.There are no back buttons. For 1st and 3rd person shooters, I find that back buttons are essential.The D-pad feels good. When I press in a direction I see that it mostly registers that direction and not diagonally. The exception is Up. When I press Up on the d-pad, there is a chance the controller will register it as Up+Left or Up+Right.The right analog joystick feels good. I was aiming fine in Fortnite. The camera was moving around well.The turbo function works great. Just hold a button down and press the 'T' button to activate turbo. This is the 1 feature that is missing from PowerA controllers. After turning off this controller, you will have to re-activate turbo on your buttons.This controller does work just fine in emulators.Wireless & Bluetooth; WindowsI wouldn't use this controller connected via bluetooth in Windows. Windows sees this controller as using Dinput. Steam will work fine but not in any other launchers (Epic, Xbox, etc). You want to get a wireless controller that uses Xinput. There's no way to tell but I thought all bluetooth controllers would use Xinput these days.Wireless & Dongle; WindowsThis works fine. I didn't have any issues in Epic or any other launchers.Wired; WindowsThe included USB-A to USB-C cable is extremely short. If you want to use this controller wired then you'll have to use your own cable. I would suggest a 10' cable.Wireless; Nintendo SwitchThe controller works fine on the Switch. I had no issues. You can use the big button in the middle with the logo on it to wake up the Switch too. The only issue is the buttons are swapped. As in, the X & Y buttons are reversed and the A & B buttons are reversed. When a Switch game says press the A button then you have to press the B button the controller.If you last connected this controller to your Switch then it won't remember any previous systems that it was connected to. You will have to reconnect to those systems (even the included USB dongle).This controller will charge fine using a USB-C charger (using a USB-C to USB-C cable).I can recommend this controller but not if you need back buttons.",

                "reviewTitle": "Impressive connectivity, but odd bumpers/triggers and no actual off button/switch",
                "reviewText": "I preface this by saying: I am not a controller guy. I am a mouse and keyboard gamer and have spent my days avoiding controllers to every extent possible, but every now and then I'm forced out of my comfort zone by my kids and so I thought I would order this because of its wide connectivity options and try it out.This EasySMX 9013Pro controller is an Xbox-style form factor that can be used on PC, the Nintendo Switch, mobile devices, and pretty much anything with Bluetooth capability that accepts controller input. That in itself is pretty impressive, as most controllers only work with a couple of these devices, but my PC, phone, and Switch all picked it up without so much as a hiccup. You have a couple connectivity options: there is an included USB-A-to-C cable that can perform charging and data transfer, though it is very short (~50 cm) and will only really work if you have a USB port right in front of you. There is a USB-A wireless adapter, which is plug-and-play; when you first insert it Windows will grab the necessary drivers and you're off and running. Steam picked it up in wired and wireless modes without an issue. It also has bluetooth, so you could skip the adapter and cable entirely and pair it to a computer too. On PC it supports both X-Input and D-Input modes and you swap between them by holding down the home button, which is a bit of a nuisance versus a physical switch.For Android devices and the Switch, pairing is via Bluetooth and was a simple matter of kicking it into pairing mode via the instructions, and then selecting it on the device. A nod to the instruction manual here - the manufacturer actually took the time to produce an included manual with clear directions written in proper English (and several other languages) which is often a rarity with aftermarket peripheral devices. It's a nice plus.Once connected, in all cases, it was picked up fine in my testing and performed as I'd expect with no obvious deficiencies. That said, a moment on build quality: the shell, joysticks, and grips are all fine, but the ABXY buttons are pretty cheap slick plastic, and the D-pad is also nothing at all special. The vaunted Hall effect triggers/bumpers are plain odd. Maybe this is because I'm more accustomed to a different style of controller, but the buttons for these are thin and I don't find them comfortable to access. While the triggers are merely okay, I feel like my hands are doing contortions to access LB/RB. I have large hands - I take XL gloves - and the rest of the controller felt fine, but the bumpers were just awkward. In terms of other odd choices, given that this is wireless bluetooth with an integrated battery, the lack of an OFF function of any sort is plain bizarre. No switch, the central button doesn't do it, you just have to force-disconnect from Bluetooth and hope it actually shuts off. Call me old fashioned, but I like a button or switch to kill the power drain and ensure it stays off, especially because you can turn it back on with a linked device just by pressing the center home button. This seriously seems like a recipe for a perpetually dead battery, especially for Android/iOS connections.At time of review, this is priced at $50 CAD. For the features and battery life, it's a decent deal. Certainly I haven't seen many other wireless controllers that have this much connectivity at this price point, but it does come with tradeoffs when it comes to some of the buttons. Not being a controller-lover at the best of times I can say that it does what I need it to do and won't break the bank nor fall apart under my light use, but if you're a serious controller-gamer then you probably want to shop around a bit before settling on this one and see if you can get something with comparable features and a little nicer buttons in the same general price range.",
