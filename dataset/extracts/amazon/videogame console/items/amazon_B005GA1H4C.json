Now to the review...I received the sensor from SupremeDealsCR and hooked it up. It worked for about 7 hours and then died. Some troubleshooting indicated that the sensor camera had stopped working. Per the enclosed documentation, I contacted Max at SupremeDealsCR rather than contacting Amazon. All I can say is SupremeDealsCR has amazing customer support. I had very fast and positive interaction with them and they quickly sent me a replacement sensor (2 days). I ran the sensor for about 12 hours incident free. Max contacted me the following day with a follow-up to ensure that everything was functioning properly and that I was happy with the support. Thank you Max and SupremeDealsCR! It is rare to find such fantastic customer service.",
