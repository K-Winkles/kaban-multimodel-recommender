                "reviewText": "For the most part,this handheld plays the games with no problems.Many games However,are in Chinese.The screen is OK.Not as sharp and clear as other handhelds and on the cheap side.Slightly blurry and dull.Not horrible but not great either.Audio is also OK at best with some crackling noise sometimes.Also,there is no headphone jack so,you are stuck with the speaker audio only.The handheld itself looks nice,kind of a ps5 design.Battery life is ok compared to similar model handhelds.After an hour of use,the battery still shows half full.So,you are probably looking at 2-3 hours of game time.It doesn't have alot of the big classic games like mario,donkey kong,metriod etc.It does have some good ones like battletoads,sonic,bionic commando and others but.....out of the thousands of games on this device,probably 3/4 of the games are duplicates.They repeat over and over again.If this handheld was half the price,it would be hard to complain too much but for the price it is now?You can spend the same or less for much,MUCH higher quality handhelds like from abernic and miyoo.This simply is not worth the money being asked.For around $30,maybe but at this price now and what you get,its not something I'd recommend to someone looking for a decent handheld unfortunately.",
