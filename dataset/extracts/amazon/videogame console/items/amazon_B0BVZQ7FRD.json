We hooked it to our big screen tho. we did not like it that we could not players without a second remote. only one comes with it. we tried to put it on 2 players and just use the one and it did not work.

                "reviewText": "I was a bit skeptical on how this would operate, if at all and I was pleasantly surprised and even a little shocked. All you have to do is put batteries in the \"TV\" part and the controller and it's ready to go. Turning the bottom knob switches it on and adjusts the volume and then it brings you to a screen where the games are categorized. Some games have typos and some are renamed so it takes a bit to find what you're looking for but I found my favorites - tetris and Mario - so I'm happy. It's been awesome to have on long car rides and even looks cute on the shelf when it isn't in use. I think everyone born in the 80s and 90s should have one of these! It's one of the coolest things I've ever gotten from Amazon.",
