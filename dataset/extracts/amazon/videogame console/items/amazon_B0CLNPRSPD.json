Yes, there are probably thousands of games on it, but there's like 20 different versions of the exact same fighting game.Also, the game naming convention isn't the greatest, get ready to browse thousands of letters trying to decipher what game is stands for.The controllers are ok, they are super light and do not feel durable. There is a slight input lag as well. But what do you expect at this price point. Also, do not miss the tiny USB Bluetooth adapter for them in the box. Mine was hiding and I didn't realize it until I tried connecting the controllers.",

Everything loaded on this device is over 25 years old. It can be fun but gets boring pretty quick. I will say, its pretty easy to setup and use and connects to the TV via HDMI. The retro \"PS2 style\" controllers require 2 AAA batteries. Does come with instructions but they are basically useless. Again, its a cool toy but not something I would pay money for personally.",
