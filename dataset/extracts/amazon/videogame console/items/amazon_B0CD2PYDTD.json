Description states that it has over 900 games\u2026 That is very inaccurate information, it doesn\u2019t have anywhere near 900 games!!! There are only 5 game options you can choose from.1. Dace Pad songs & exercise2. Shooting games3. Sports4. Puzzles5. Classic gamesThere are some games that are decent quality games, but some of them are not good quality at all, and are very fuzzy. Overall quality isn\u2019t the greatest. Some of the games glitch and freeze, and it\u2019s kind of hard to get out of the game. You have to finish the game before exiting. A plus is that it was very easy to put together.The whole system comes with a dance mat, one gun, and two remotes. You will need a total of 8 AAA batteries. 4 for the controllers, 2 for the gun and 2 for the dance pad.The songs for the dance pad are quite interesting, the music videos are in Chinese and very provocative dancing, not child appropriate, (I would say.)My kids say the better games are some of the shooting games.For $100, I do not feel that is an appropriate price for this gaming system!!! It is way overpriced, the most I would pay would be in the $40-$50 range. Although I would not repurchase this gaming set.",

                "reviewText": "I see some bad reviews here but to be honest this game is a good value for the money!Most of the negative reviews I see are based on user error, in my opinion.This game truly gives you tons of classics, we are talking arcade games as well as old Nintendo and Atari games, plus more.The shooting games are a lot of fun, you just have to calibrate the target aim before each game on shooting games.The motion control games are great and the sensors work very well.The dance pad and the dance games are a lot of fun, they even have a calorie counter and a step counter built into the game.The only con that I see with this is that the dance pad is a bit smaller than I would think it should be, but that is my opinion.Even small children have a bit of an issue overstepping the squares from what I am seeing but overall you cannot be the entertainment that this brings to the whole family for the price.You will need several AAA batteries in order to utilize all the components built in.I believe you would need eight in total.5/5 overall.",

                "reviewText": "I recently tried out this Game Console, and my experience falls in the middle, earning it a three-star rating. The console's extensive library of games, dance songs, and the AR Gun Game feature is appealing and caters to both kids and adults. The TV plug-and-play setup is convenient, but I find the overall cost to be somewhat steep for what's offered. While it's undoubtedly a decent toy gift option, the higher price may not align with the value provided. Despite the slight disappointment in terms of cost, this does deliver a diverse gaming experience, making it a reasonable choice for those willing to invest a bit more for a comprehensive entertainment package without the xBox or Playstation price point.",

The guns are accurate in shots and the dance mat is a lot of fun too great way to exercise and have fun. The controllers vibrate with the game so it gives you the feel as if you were in the game.",

                "reviewText": "We had fun playing a lot of the old games we grew up with through the 80's...Galaga, Centipede, etc. There's a lot to choose from; something for everyone like math puzzles, checkers, racing, shooting, bowling, fishing, classic arcade, memory games, etc. But, for what it's priced at, I'm surprised they don't include batteries....you'll need a lot of AA's. Also, the remote control is really small and narrow, and my hand was cramping after a bit. It's a fun game system, but at about a $100 price point, I'd expect a little better. There are similar systems for a much better value, and more comfortable controllers.",
