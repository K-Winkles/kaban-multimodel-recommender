                "reviewText": "The Xbox Series S is the more affordable and compact version of Microsoft's latest gaming console, the Xbox Series X. With a price tag of $299 (at most places), it's positioned as an entry-level console that provides players with the next-gen gaming experience without breaking the bank.One of the most notable features of the Xbox Series S is its size. It's significantly smaller than the Xbox Series X and even the Xbox One, making it a great option for gamers who have limited space in their homes. Despite its compact size, it still packs a punch, thanks to its custom-built AMD Zen 2 processor, which provides faster load times and better performance compared to the previous generation of consoles.The Xbox Series S supports ray tracing, which is a graphics technology that allows for more realistic lighting and shadows. It also supports up to 120 frames per second (fps) for smoother gameplay, and it can display games at up to 1440p resolution. However, it's worth noting that the console doesn't support native 4K resolution, which is a drawback for gamers who want the highest possible graphics quality.One of the downsides of the Xbox Series S is its limited storage capacity. It comes with a 512GB solid-state drive (SSD), which is much faster than traditional hard drives but can fill up quickly if you have a large game library. This means that you may need to purchase an external hard drive to expand your storage space.Overall, the Xbox Series S is a great option for gamers who are on a budget or have limited space in their homes. It provides excellent performance, fast load times, and access to a vast library of games. However, it's important to note its limitations, such as its lack of native 4K support and limited storage capacity.",

                "reviewText": "I always used to camp on the PC Master Race side and rightfully so. For those who want to squeeze the last polygon detail out of their games, PC wins hands down.Until I decided to dip my feet into the console world and I now understand why it is so popular. Here is my top 3 reason Xbox Series S is such an awesome console:**Positives:**1. **Priceless Laughs - Literally:**Scored the box at $240 (sans 3-month Game Pass). Even at $300, it is cheaper than therapy and light-years ahead in value. Good luck finding a PC on sale that can compete at the gaming performance and experience.2. **Quick Resume - Console Version of Time Travel:**Microsoft's Quick Resume feature is the real-life cheat code. Turn off the console, unplug it, do a cartwheel if you feel like it, and when you're ready to play again, it's like your game never heard of the concept of shutdowns. It's the magical pause button for reality, minus the messy consequences.3. **Pixel, Please! (or Not):**Series S delivers Native 4K gaming, and for those who debate pixels like it's a philosophical dilemma, fear not. Even upscaled frames are like a culinary masterpiece \u2013 you won't notice if the chef used a different spice, and it still tastes like victory. Cinematic experiences galore, even if the hairs look like pixelated spaghetti up close. But hey, who needs hairbrushes in the Wild West?**Negative Aspects:**1. **Storage: Sibling Rivalry Edition:**The Series S's 512GB storage is like having a cool older sibling with a tiny room \u2013 it's great until you realize there's no space left for your stuff. A few AAA games later, and you're playing a digital version of Tetris with your storage. The struggle is real, but it's just a minor inconvenience, like having to choose between sneakers or canvas for the day.2. **Card Shock Therapy:**Expansion Cards may cost a kidney, but Quick Resume is the VIP ticket to gaming nirvana. Sure, they're pricey, but isn't that the cost of luxury? These cards are the designer handbags of the gaming world \u2013 nice to have, but not a must.3. **Disc-less Dilemma:**GameStop's pre-owned game hunt feels like a treasure hunt; Xbox Store discounts are more like rare Pok\u00e9mon sightings. Yes, digital is convenient. What's more convenient is the ultra cheap games you get at GameStop for pre-owned disc games.**General Experience:**The Xbox Series S is like a buffet \u2013 some choices are not as appealing, but you still leave with a full belly and a smile. It's the imperfect hero we need, not the one we deserve, and that's okay.Keeping mine for sure!",

                "reviewText": "It seemed impossible to find and buy these consoles for over a year until I got a notification that they were available for purchase on Amazon for the exact same price as the Microsoft store.I bought this before cloud gaming was good. Now that the Xbox team worked hard on perfecting cloud gaming, it's only gotten better. I am just a Gold member, but my room mate has Game Pass. I have daily played games downloaded directly to the drive, and most other games are available on cloud (though I do download them and them delete them from the drive or move them to my other drive that is not SSD).I don't have a new TV (in fact I still have a 'dumb' TV) and it's only capable of so much despite it being 4k UHD capable, games play flawlessly. One of my main games is OW and the new OW2. I have it set to have balance between performance and quality on both games and they both play without any issues and barely any latencies (thanks quality internet!).If you get the S series and have Game Pass you will not be disappointed. If you're looking for a bigger hard drive Get the Series X or buy a compatible SSD drive.This console is more than capable for playing everyday. I use it for everything, from playing games to listening to Spotify to watching my favorite series and shows on all the apps in 4k UHD. Never had any issues with the console what so ever.Also very easy to set up with any home systems you have. I use Google Home and can easily use voice commands to turn it on/off and load up any app or game.My ONLY issue are with the controllers. The new Series S/X controllers are great out of the box, but after 9-12 months of use they go bunk. If you use a wired head set expect it to stop working/start echoing/come in and out within the year. The bumpers don't last long either. I never throw it around and I keep it clean, and despite the up keep I still have issues. Good thing they go on sale often. I will never pay full price for the controllers because they just don't last in my experience.",

                "reviewText": "The Xbox Series S is the second Microsoft console I own since the 360. It comes with a 512-gigabyte hard drive and a wireless controller. Although there is no CD drive, the console is all-digital and allows multiple users to download and play their purchased games from the Windows Store. The only drawback is that if you want more storage space, you may have to buy an external hard drive. I recommend the Seagate brand with the Xbox logo on it.The resolution is set at 1440p and you still get decent quality. You may not notice much graphical difference on the other version, the Series X. Best of all, you can play the Xbox Series S on your computer monitor if you own the \"Elgato HD60s+,\" the game capture device, if desired. From my own experience, I don't need an expensive television to get the best graphics, so I play it right from my I-Mac 2019 with the retina display monitor.If you are looking for a budget console and just want to play your games casually or with a game pass, then the Series S is right for you. With a sleek design look, the system is lightweight, small, and very easy to carry if you are going on a trip. Perfect for both new and hardcore gamers for this generation.",

Fiquei um tanto preocupada com a capacidade de 512 do Disco SSD, mas at\u00e9 que coube bastante jogo e somando a um HD Externo de 500 que j\u00e1 era usado no nosso Xbox One, foi o suficiente. \u00d3tima compra. N\u00e3o \u00e9 o Xbox top de linha mas o Custo Benef\u00edcio \u00e9 excelente. Assinatura do Game Pass Ultimate pra ficar melhor ainda kkkk. A nota fiscal n\u00e3o veio com o produto, mas enviei mensagem ao vendedor, e ele me enviou.",
