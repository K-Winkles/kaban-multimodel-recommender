Please make sure your TV has an AV output and channels. Please note: This console does not support HDMI. How to connect your TV: The 2.5mm end is plugged into the console and the other two cables (RCA) are plugged into the two jacks on the TV. Ensure that the cable plugs are connected to the appropriate colour sockets. Then tune the TV to the appropriate AV channel. How do I connect to the handheld controller? The batteries (2*AAA, not included) are automatically matched to the game console signal when placed in the joystick. If you have bought another joystick, the first one to match with the console is the P1 controller, which means it controls the game console, and the second one to match with the console is the P2 controller, which only works on the second character of the game. Handle signal: 1. Controller LED is flashing, which means it is looking for a match to the game host signal. 2. Controller LED is always on, which means the handle has matched the signal to the game host and the handle LED is also flashing when it is working.",

Other issue is the order of buttons \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d are inverted; that kills the experience.Pros: cheap, charges quickly, nice design.Cons: Low quality overall. Missing the best NES games. Most of the games are unknown or is a non English version. The remote has buttons on the wrong position and there is no way to correct that.Overall is worth it knowing that it is really cheap, but I think will be better to pay more for some console with the correct controller and knowing the games that you will get. If they don\u2019t publish the games that it comes with, is for a reason.",
