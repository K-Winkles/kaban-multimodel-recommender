                "reviewText": "Well, this little game or device, whatever it's called, the truth is that it doesn't have the joy of being a console. The truth is that games have nothing to do with retro games.Although they do have some fun, to be honest I think it's not worth buying this!Because! Because it costs 30 dollars I don't know if the price is fair and the materials and finishes are terrible.I won't return it because I don't want to waste time on it.I'll just leave it there and I'll see who gave it to But my opinion is don't buy this I think that for 20 pains the up console with 400 games is better",
