                "reviewText": "The square screen is just wonderful for a device like this. I even cancelled an order for a more powerful device because I am enjoying using this plenty and catching up on old games, and for the first time vertical scrolling games!Two cool features aside from playing retro games are the pico-8 support (you can buy + download the raspberry pi version and install it on the RGB30 and download games through wi-fi and the screen ratio is perfect) and support for something called Portmaster which lets you browse freeware games, some old pc games and such, however, like half I've tried don't work, but even still it's cool to play a few.You've probably already watched videos or read about how people love this, so here's the mediocre qualities that give it 4 stars rather than 5 for me:Any button that isn't the D-pad or 4 face buttons are clicky. I hate that sound during a quiet night.There are some aspects where you may want to go in and do little DIY mods, like the d-pad diagonals can be less squishy by adding tape. and the shoulder buttons can be lined with felt or lubed up with vaseline so they don't \"jiggle\" (which is really the only thing that makes the device have a \"cheap\" feel- the plastic clunking about when you move it). So again this isn't a bad thing - I think opening electronics and fiddling with them endears them to you, it's something more people should do. Youtube those mods for examples and be careful.Mine has some screen light bleed which is a little annoying.The battery is finicky. It charges slow as heck, faster charging cables don't work, and sometimes doesn't update the battery level indicator unless you turn the screen off and on. Or it never gets to 100%. It's weird.Get new SD cards, because the cheap ones it comes with will screw you over in odd ways. For example, I ran a system update and had all sorts of problems after, but starting over with fresh brand name SD cards solved everything, and I've been able to update fine. If you don't want to search for games, just copy the contents of the games SD card to a new one.",

                "reviewText": "As someone who grew up playing Gameboy and arcade games, this console is absolutely amazing and well-worth the price. I knew it was coming pre-loaded with a ton of games, but I wasn't really sure which games or what to expect. To my delight, it's loaded with hundreds of Gameboy Color games, arcade games, PSP games, as well as dozens of other systems' games. Unlike a review that claimed these games are from the \"80's\", these are the games mostly from the late 90's and early 2000's, including Pokemon games, Mario Kart games, and literally hundreds of others, including games I even wanted as a kid but wasn't able to have for one reason or another. There are tons of games I recognize and hundreds more I don't but am incredibly eager to try. This device is so loaded it will keep me occupied for literally years. It's incredible for nostalgia and fun, but it's also PERFECT as a gift to young kids who haven't had the chance to play some of these wonderful, iconic games.The console itself is simple and a bit delicate, but it comes with a screen protector and carrying case to keep it safe. It also has a micro HDMI cable to connect to the tv, though I haven't tried it yet as I don't have the cable on hand. You can plug earphones or headphones into it. The instructions are translated from Chinese, but they give enough information to get the basics, one of which is exiting a game to the main menu, which you can do from clicking the right control stick and scrolling down to \"Exit Game.\"I am so impressed and absolutely adore this new console. \"Made in China\" or not, this is a fantastic device that will delight anyone who enjoys video games. I absolutely adore it.",

                "reviewText": "The console itself is built well enough, I had some minor stick drift on the left stick but a quick tap ocassionally fixes it so it's not really a big deal and nobody else seemed to have this issue so I wouldn't worry about that too much. This is a retro console from the era of 4:3 aspect ratio meaning most games will not take up the whole screen. It comes with a nice case, charging cable, and instructions which you MUST READ! Good news the instructions are very short! It has some modern features like quick save that I really appreciated and my only gripe is there is no way to completely turn it off. Holding the power button does nothing and pressing the power button one time puts it into hibernation which will slowly drain the battery so if you plan to use this frequently it won't be a problem but if you stuff it into a drawer it will most likely need charging the next time you want to use it. All in for about $100 I think this is a super cool way for us older gen gamers to revisit many of our out of print or hard to find classics like UN Squadron. I totally recommend this for anyone into retro gaming!",

                "reviewText": "Upon receiving the rgb30 I was very excited to unbox, and begin playing, after the initial setup, still no games were available to play, only pico-8 and scummVM and neither will launch from Home Screen. After a one hour update of JELos, still no games showing up. Ordered a replacement. Hopefully it works, they are also over priced. 49$ on alibaba. For 50$ profit the seller must be happy about a product that doesn\u2019t work out of box. If the replacement works then 5stars. We will see.",
