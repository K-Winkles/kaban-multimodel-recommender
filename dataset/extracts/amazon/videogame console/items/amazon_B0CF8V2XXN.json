                "reviewText": "Cheapo XX-in-ONE handhelds are a dime a dozen, you can find them for a few bucks anywhere. They have the usual collection of questionably legal ROMs but it seems that they've done some work with this one. There are 48 games that have been modified to work with a vibration function. Not a great feature but a new feature nonetheless.It's all from NES-era so there's a ton of arcade-style games which means a lot of immediate pick-up-and-play but also put-down-and-forget. I usually play a few rounds of Tetris (or #22 BONUS, as it's called in the menu) after a shower. If all you want is to burn a few minutes but don't want to get too engrossed with a more engaging game this handheld has a lot of potential.Weirdly enough there are games that still support 2-player mode, despite the fact that there is no way to connect a second controller.Unfortunately the D-pad is awkward to use and doesn't consistently register a press if your finger is on the right place. The rest of the hardware is fine. The other buttons work well and the screen is bright and easy to see. I love the fact that the power switch is a hardware switch that immediately turns the device on and off. There are also multiple turbo buttons which simulate the rapid pressing of A and B. Charging is done through USB-C, which is nice to see. However there is no indicator as to the device's current charge level, though in reality that isn't something you'd need to see.The AV mode does work, it automatically switches to the output when the cable is plugged in and the handheld becomes one of those TV plug-and-play consoles. You're going to want an older style 4:3 display for the authentic experience, bonus points for a CRT.",

Although this is a modern electronic device, it is designed to look like an old-school game with around 200 different games to choose from. This is available in four different colors, so if there are multiple children in the home, each of them can have a distinct color.The game is simple to use and easy to hold in the hands of children. It includes a variety of games such as puzzles, action, instructional, and more. Some of them even feature vibrating abilities similar to those found in modern game systems.I like that this is a rechargeable device that may be used for four hours or more on a single charge. This is ideal for playing with in the car because it keeps the child busy and sitting still for extended periods. It includes a spot where you can connect a lanyard if you wish to wear it around the child's neck. This is inexpensive, entertaining, and fun for children.",
