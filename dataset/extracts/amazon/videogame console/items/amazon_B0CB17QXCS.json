The only issue I had with it is the noisy loose trigger buttons. However I used the foam padding that came in the packaged and cut it to shape and some holes to place inside the handheld behind the triggers to keep them quiet and firm. I bought an OTG cable so I could use a USB joystick and charge it at the same time, normal USB-C hubs will not work. Didn't bother using the included micro SD. Screen protector is garbage. The screen's edges curve and the screen protector will not seat flush, looks terrible and dust will get under it (it should've been made smaller to avoided the curves and still provide some protection). Battery life is amazing. The lack of Wi-Fi is a bit disappointing, but I've made more use out of the HDMI output. Super thrilled, amazingly priced device for what it can do. Wish there was a black version or solid white color though!!",

                "reviewText": "Although their are a lot of games included they are not going to be the focus of my review. Instead I want to focus on the device itself. It is fully functional and preforms extremely well in every category I was looking for in a small handheld emulator. It's design is fun and nostalgic, it's buttons and directional pad have a great feel to them, the hdmi works well, and the screen resolution is great for every game it is able to handle. It preforms extremely well and it really is a plug and play device that you can jump right into. The makers should definitely have pride in their product. If your looking for a small device that meets the demands above don't be afraid to jump on getting this device. This was my first handheld emulator and I was a bit nervous on which one to try. I don't think I could have made a better choice though.",

                "reviewText": "I love this! I have a switch but was disappointed at the few retro games available to play. This is completely different! I haven't added any games to it simply because i haven't had to. Everything ive wanted to play has been on it already.The screen looks great, very bright and sharp. The buttons feel nice, not cheap at all. And the battery lasts a decent amount but i guess it can always last longer.This has a mini hdmi port on the top so you can connect it to a tv. This will also accept a controller via the usbc port in the bottom. Xbox seems to be the easiest to plug and play: and with a usb hub you can connect two controllers. So you can easily use this as a console. The manual says it will take a wireless controller, but i haven't tried that yet.",

                "reviewText": "The RG35xx is the standard for affordable retro gaming definitely through SNES and Sega Genesis.It feels quality in the hands and the battery life is more than acceptable; coming with 6,800 games means that it does come with a lot of games that just aren't that fun and that clutter up the menu system, but once you learn about it, you can easily modify the system and remove the extra games off of the SD Card to make the menus simpler.I paid a few bucks extra to buy it from Amazon after a bad experience trying to order one from China and that was a good move.You can definitely improve on the device by installing Garlic OS on it, and adding two named-branded and far more reliable SD cards -I worry about data loss with the generic Chinese memory cards that come with it. The Garlic OS and RetroArch UI that can be loaded on it, is superior, IMO, and allows quick and easy over-clocking of the CPU to run more CPU intense games smoothly. A Mario 64 port is available for the device, but with reduced graphics quality vs. the original, although it is difficult to play some N64 games without thumbsticks.Although it's possible to get the device working with external game controllers over the USB port, it requires creating / modifying low level files that explain what each button should do.My primary complaint with the device is that the HDMI output seemed to have issues and continually made my TV flash and only display the game image for a second or two before flashing off again. I'm sure there's yet another OS file that could be modified to get it to work, but this feature did not work for me out of the box.For me part of the allure of the Anbernic RG35xx is that it does have the retro Gameboy vibe, but it does have less than ideal ergonomics and your hands WILL get tired after a while.It's really REALLY hard to complain about the device for how much it cost and when you compare it to it's competitors in this price point, it is the clear current winner for me. Putting in some work will make it even better still.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. It was working in the beginning for some games but most just wouldn\u2019t start up. I just ignored that for the few games that I got working but then those games would start glitching or I couldn\u2019t play them any more after so much time. I got about 15-20 hours in tactics advanced and maybe 5-6 hours in tactics for final fantasy. They were fun and I enjoyed the game play on both os but garlic was a bit better once I got used to the setup.I\u2019m pretty disappointed with how few of the games actually work.",

                "reviewText": "Excelente consola. Creo que si la quieres usar tal cual te llega, no vas a tener una muy buena experiencia. Sin embargo, puedes hacer varios cambios que mejorar\u00e1n much\u00edsimo tu experiencia con la consola. Primero que nada, creo que es muy importante comprarle memorias de mejor calidad y cambiar los rom que trae, muchos no abren, muchos est\u00e1n en chino o japon\u00e9s, en fin, un desastre. Hay un paquete de roms que se llama TinySetGo, tiene tres distintos paquetes dependiendo del tama\u00f1o de la SD que quieras usar. Yo recomiendo usar una de 32Gb para instalarle el GarlicOS limpio (no me gust\u00f3 la configuraci\u00f3n que trae) y una de 128 para meter todos los juegos. Hay muchos tutoriales en youtube que te explican como hacer esto, es super f\u00e1cil, adem\u00e1s de que hay una p\u00e1gina dedicada a esta consola que est\u00e1 en espa\u00f1ol, igual con muchos tutoriales. No s\u00e9 si puedo poner links aqu\u00ed, pero si googleas rg35xx te debe salir de las primeras.Est\u00e1 perfecta para jugar consolas como super nintendo o game boy advance, de hecho me parece la consola perfecta para jugar romhacks de pok\u00e9mon. Los juegos de PS1 los corre de maravilla, pero la pantalla no me ayuda mucho para juegos de plataforma como Spyro o Crash, pero los RPG no me afecta tanto.El \u00fanico detalle que tiene la consola es que sufre mucho de falsos diagonales, y seguro vas a morirte m\u00e1s de una vez por eso en el Mario. No es siempre, no lo vuelve injugable, pero ah\u00ed est\u00e1 y se nota. He visto que se puede arreglar con cinta, pero no me he atrevido a abrirlo y hacerlo.",
