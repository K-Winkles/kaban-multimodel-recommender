                "reviewText": "I spent over 2hrs looking out for and researching different handheld game consoles for myself. I grew up in the 1980s when kids actually played outside...went to the mall, the movies and of course, the arcades!! I have 2 retro consoles now that I love...but there are tons of games that are repeatedly on all of them!! If you're looking for something unique and out of the ordinary...I highly recommend this product !!",

                "reviewText": "I think this is a pretty decent handheld gaming device for younger children. My son's 8 & he's getting a lot of use out of it so far! I even played a few games on it like the \"Solitaire\" type of card games we've found on it & a few others. The screen on it is pretty small, but it's good enough for a young child to start with before getting them a more expensive handheld gaming device. And it's great for taking along in the car or keeping it in your purse while running errands if you need something to keep your child busy while they're waiting at the dentist, or while grocery shopping, etc.I like that it's colorful, has a comfortable & small enough shape for a child to hold, & that it's a convenient size for taking it places. The volume on it is adjustable (there's a very small black dial on it for the volume...it's easy to not see it, but the fact that the volume dial is so small at least keeps it from getting accidentally bumped up real loud suddenly.)The games on it aren't of the highest quality, but they aren't that bad of quality either really. My son's having fun using it & the sheer quantity of games on it is nice for a child at least having a variety to choose from. Some of the games are similar to one another & some are very easy, while others are more difficult...so it's good that it can be used by children of various ages & that they can pick & choose what difficulty level of game they're in the mood for.The games are pretty easy to figure out as well & my son's having no issues with using it & figuring out the games so far (he's 8.) I helped him figure out the couple Solitaire-like card games on it though. It's easy to charge it & it lasts awhile after it's been fully charged. And I also like that you can plug it into your tv apparently (we haven't tried doing that yet since I don't have the plug/cord for doing that & will have to get one, so it would've been a nice added item if they had included a cord for that in with the game.)We don't really have any complaints with it yet, other than wishing it came with a cord for using it with our tv. We're happy enough with it so far & my son thinks it's pretty cool! :)",

Really takes them back to our youth without those insane high res graphics that can often bore kids these days! The battery life seems to last long enough and the game play and controls are good enough, it'll definitely take you back to your youth!",

                "reviewText": "Most devices like this that advertise X number of games preloaded are filled with pirated and bootleg games. I was pleasantly surprised to find every game on this was original! All variations of other games, but originally programmed none the less.It does have the advertised number of games as far as I could tell (I didn\u2019t exactly count). The games themselves are relatively basic. You won\u2019t find something as deep as Super Mario World, but it does come with some basic platformers, racing games, puzzle games, and other various ripoff/generic type games.The games themselves range from okay to VERY basic. For example, when you clear one level in a game, it will say \u201cWIN\u201d and immediately boot you back to the menu. I\u2019ve beaten about 4 games in 5 minutes.The titles on the main menu are more of a showcase of what this has to offer. Multiple levels and difficulties in the racing game and ball rolling game, for example. If I were younger, I\u2019d definitely be into this for a while. I\u2019d also get bored quickly and move on to something else. Still, credit where it\u2019s due, it still isn\u2019t pirated.While very basic, I can still give it its due. I can definitely recommend this to a younger kid that wants to play games, but isn\u2019t ready for a Switch just yet.",

If you want a way to keep your kid occupied with a screen, but not your phone, this could do it. There may be other options if you want your kid to experience the 16 bit \"classics\".",

This portable gaming device is much better than I thought and my 7-year-old has proclaimed it's the best thing I've ever ordered off Amazon! The graphics on the screen are better than expected and with over 200 games, you'll never get bored. The game is easy to use, play, and charge. My only critique is that it feels a little lightweight and flimsy which causes the concern of breaking upon the first drop on a hard surface. Overall, this has been a godsend for the car rides!",

The plastic is cheap and the bottoms are mushy and not precise at all. The software is the worst part. The games are very bad, or a clon of a semi-good game at best. I really wanted to like it, but there is no redeeming quality in any shape or form. I don't know what it was made for, was it made for an adult with nostalgia for the 8, 16, and 32-bit games? none of the old original games are here, or anything similar. Is it made for a child to keep him/her busy? Kids today have phones, and none of them will give this device more than 15 min tops of curiosity time or attention.",
