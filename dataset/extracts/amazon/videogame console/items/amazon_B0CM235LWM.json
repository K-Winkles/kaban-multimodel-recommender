This was purchased as a Christmas gift. Needless to say, it was never able to be used because we could never get it to turn on. Even let it charge overnight. While pushing the power button, you could see a red light flash through the little pin hole on the right bottom of the device. Disappointed, but I guess you get what you pay for.

It is made durable and sturdy and he loves that he has games to play that his brothers don\u2019t \ud83d\ude09 Great value for the money.",
