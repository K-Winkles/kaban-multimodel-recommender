                "reviewText": "The console has a power button, indicator lights, and comes with remote control, two battery powered wireless game controllers (playstation type) and a hub adapter to attach up to four usb items/controllers. I wish that the controllers had built in rechargeable batteries, as that would save me a tone of money over time. Such better controllers can be purchased separately. The software has emulators for arcade and various home console systems. I'm finding that it's not easy to match the name of an emulator to the game console it emulates. Also within each emulator the game titles don't match the cartridge or disk names I recall. The games I want to play are in there somewhere, but there isn't one universal search for the whole library of games on here...just a separate search in each emulator, and the titles are different. Fortunately there is a photo of each game, so I find the one I want to play by that. Then games I played in America are in Japanese on here...which I've not had the privilage of learning yet...so in game I can't read the text options or cinema captions. Now, the music is a nice feature when scrolling through game lists, but that doesn't make up for the detractors. Nice try, but I'm looking elsewhere.",

                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying that I received this item free through Amazon Vine. I wouldn't pay the current $119.99 price for it. However, as I type this review there is a $40 coupon. At $79.99 with the coupon, I would seriously consider it. There are over 65,000 games on this system. It would take years to go through all of them. I've watched plenty of YouTube reviews of these systems and none of them come close to being perfect. This one is no exception. In the few days that I've been playing around with this, I've come across a few games that wouldn't play or even load. One of those is the arcade game Berzerk. I was going to try to change emulators or mess with the settings, but fortunately, I found that there is a version of the game in the MAME section works just find.The system that I got came with a 256 GB SD card installed. From what I've seen, systems that come with a 256 GB SD card usually will have over 100,000 games. At least that's how they advertise them. In reality, there are often thousands and thousands of duplicate. This system has just over 65,000 games. That's a lot of games. There are duplicates, but there appears to be less than some of the pumped up 100,000+ game systems. I'm not saying that it's been curated, but there aren't all that many duplicates as far as I can tell so far.One of the things I like about this system is that it has an on/off button. Apparently, a lot of these systems don't have one. I also like the design of the case. It looks cool but not gaudy. There aren't any crazy designs or lighting effects. Some people may like that style of system, but I like this low key design. It doesn't stand out sitting next to my TV. I especially like that the system was up and running pretty much straight out of the box. I just threw some batteries in the controller, plugged the box in and turned it on. I didn't even bother configuring the controllers. I just jumped right into the games. Of course, you can map the controllers to your own liking if you choose to do so.If you're considering buying one of these systems, I would strongly suggest that you watch the reviews on YouTube first. There are some really in depth reviews of most of the more popular systems that are sold here on Amazon. I'm giving this game box four stars, because I pretty much knew what to expect after watching a lot of those YouTube videos. I'm also not a hardcore gamer. I just like to play an old game from time to time. This system isn't perfect, but if you're into retro gaming, there are enough games here to keep me entertained for a very long time.",
