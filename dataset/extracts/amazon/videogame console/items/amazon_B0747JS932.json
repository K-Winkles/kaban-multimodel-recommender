                "reviewText": "Get ready for an honest rant. ;)I bought this for mainly classic rpg and fighting games. The fighting games played but the controls were sticky and unusable. Not to mention LOUD!!! I got complaints whenever I was using it that the button clicking was too obnoxious. They are so loud that I couldn\u2019t hear the game sounds clearly unless I wore earbuds. The dpad buttons kept sticking and made action games unplayable. And the joystick isn\u2019t accurate. It too kept sticking in one of the four directions and wouldn\u2019t unstick for some time after releasing.Quite a few of the rpg games I got this for didn\u2019t work. Said they couldn\u2019t be loaded. They played on every other system I have so I know the files are good. I loaded via the usb several times and with different file versions and still didn\u2019t play. The firmware used outdated and buggy bios. Glitchy graphics and bad interface. Names of games aren\u2019t clear so it is like gambling to see what game I was going to get. Some games were smooth after load while others kept flickering.Screen and sound were decent. Not good but decent. Screen cover was plastic (the actual screen, not the protector that came with it) and images were not crisp. The edges had a black line around that cut off some of the playable area. This is important if you want to track scores or health.Battery lasted for a few hours with new games and only about an hour or two with arcade games. Not too bad except the low power warning doesn\u2019t always show and unit will shut off unexpectedly when power gets low. The power on led was very bright and distracting. It doesn\u2019t turn off after some time playing.Bottom line: don\u2019t waste frustration or money on this. Save up for a better system. One that has better software, controls, and screen. I wouldn\u2019t mind if this was only half the price but it turned out to be far more expensive than what I received. I had more fun gambling on which games loaded than actually trying to play the games with the awful, clackity controls.",

                "reviewText": "I must say, after reading some reviews I was nervous. It seems to be hit or miss when it comes to this, but I have absolutely no complaints and couldn't be happier.Controls are fine. Screen looks great. No Lagging. There are some decent games that come on it, but being able to delete and add games at my neck and call is what pushes this into the awesome realm.I've always played roms onna computer. Using the keyboard as a makeshift joy stick, but now I have an actual d pad with real buttons and it's a game changer.FF6, golden sun 1 and 2, the shining force series, phantasy star series, land stalker, castlevania's, megaman, mario games, mega bomber man for snes, pirates gold! Seriously, this will get it use and then some.So, as a happy buyer, knowing that other people out there weren't nearly as satisfied... Im not sure what to say. It's great for me! And I'd recommend. But always read all the comments and make sure you're not breaking the bank with this.:)",

You have Sonic, you got Pac-Man, Miss Pac-Man, mortal Kombat, Street fighter, x-men, Spider-Man ,Ghostbusters 2, teenage mutant Ninja turtles, super Mario Brothers, a whole bunch of super Mario Brothers, 4 mortal Kombats. Some of the games don't work the bottom arrow key sometimes stays down and you have to touch it to pick it back up. I have saved games but I'm not able to find the games I've saved guess I have to do some more reading in the manual. When I received the console battery was already charged I have no idea how long the battery lasts. I think that the game console is well worth the price but the small round arrow joystick thing is useless. It does not come with a v cable to attach the TV.",

A ton of them just don't work and the ones that do run at unplayable frame rates and stuttering sounds.I found some videos/information online and they all pretty much confirmed the above. I wanted this for my son but I'm not fond of torturing my own kids. Yeah, for 30 bucks, you get what you pay for, but really they just shouldn't sell it period.",
