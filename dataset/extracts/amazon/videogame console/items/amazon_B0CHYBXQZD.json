None of the 4 worked as expected. They are cheap and very poor quality. Guess we were expecting too much.If you want this to play super Mario 1 and finish the game in 1 sitting then maybe it's worth buying. but even that didn't work well.Find a better option. They are out there.The game catalog was also very poor. And many of the games repeat in the list. Missing most of the great titles.Avoid this item.",

                "reviewText": "I was very excited to purchase this for my grandson. So many games and many classics that I played as a kid. The game itself was easy for him to use (6 year old) and perfect hand held size. I also like the fact that it could be hooked up to a television. My grandson had a blast with this. Unfortunately after the battery charge it had when it arrived was gone the game wouldn't charge again. The reason for my 3 star review is because of the battery charging issue, he was only able to enjoy his gift for the short amount of time before it was a useless hunk of plastic. It may have just been that I received a bad one in the bunch because otherwise it would have been great",

It\u2019s portable but it can also get hooked up to the tv I have a 75 inch tv and it has no problem or lag the cable to connect to tv is a little short but that\u2019s honestly the only downside. It has a bunch of game that are both muitplayer and solo. Me and my gf had a ton of fun for the price. Great console worth the money.\ud83d\ude42",
