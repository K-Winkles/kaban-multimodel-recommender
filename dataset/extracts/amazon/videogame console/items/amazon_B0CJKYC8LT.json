                "reviewText": "To me the star rating should be based on the cost/value you get from an item. Although I received this through Vine, to me it is well worth $30-$40. Don't expect modern graphics or the latest games. However, this does have some classic games from Nintendo and Atari that I really enjoyed: Street Fighter, 1942, Double Dragon, Mortal Kombat 4, Altered Beast, Ninja Turtles, Super Contra, Galaga, and the list goes on.I haven't heard of 75% of the games on here. Not a big deal because there is a huge selection and it gives the opportunity to explore new games. At least half of the games, maybe more, do not have title screens in English, but on these old games it doesn't matter too much after you get into the game play. I did run into one issue. There was a game called \"Small Mario\", it looked more like some type of slot machine game, but it froze up on me (note: not a hardware issue as I was able to press the return button to go to the home screen) .Overall construction of the device is on the cheap side. My son already scratched the screen and the main plastic housing doesn't seem like it would hold up if dropped.It comes with a controller for two players and AV cables for hook up to a TV . Playing two players on the device's screen is tricky, because it is one of the older screen types that are difficult to view clearly at an angle. Not an issue if plugged into a regular tv though. Despite some of my prior criticism I still give it 5 stars because the amount of fun to be had for the price.Update: After a bit more use I think it's necessary to reduce my original review from five stars to four. The graphics on several games are not actually as good as the original (which isn't saying much on some of the games). It is especially noticeable if you hook it up to a tv . Also, the functionality on some of the games is also not the same as the original. I have noticed this on the fighting games and some of the controls don't work properly. It's still fun, but I personally wouldn't pay more than $25 for it.",

                "reviewText": "I was disappointed with this handheld set because not many of the games were in English and I didn't know how to play some of them. The extra controller doesn't work and not all of the buttons worked efficiently on the device when playing some of the games so I couldn't play them properly. I was hoping there would be some recognizable games on it from my childhood but it's mostly what seems to be games designed to copy the originals. I will try hooking it up to a tv to see if there are less glitches, but I'm not feeling too hopeful about it.",

There are several games that are perfect for his developmental age, the picture quality is actually pretty good, and the sound definitely works. (It is pretty loud but there is a volume adjuster.) I love that this set is rechargeable and we don\u2019t have to worry about having AAA batteries on hand. We have not tried hooking it up to a tv so I\u2019m not sure how accessible that is. My 9 year old and I give it 2 thumbs up!",
