The reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of a full 5, is this weird delay in charging. Also, it won't charge while you use it, which is also just an odd thing. There are no menu settings for button configurations that I can see or screen brightest etc. To me, these are pretty minor things. Overall, this is a very good system for the price.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I\u2019ve logged over 40 hours on this unit because I wanted to test it thoroughly. If you are over the age of 40 you\u2019ve seen 100s of \u201cgame systems\u201d that are loaded with the classics and promise you a nostalgic experience. You may have even had a few around for you and your kids to resolve issues of gamer supremacy on Ms. Pac-man or Missile Command. Unfortunatetly most of those systems will fail in days and if they don\u2019t then you find that the emulator or controls won\u2019t work. The thing is most of those system retail for under 40 and are designed for a three pin monitor drive hookup. This system is the size and roughly the shape of the Switch and a number of other handheld game systems. It also has a higher price point (109) than the cheaper \u2018Classic Game systems\u2019 and boasts 68GB. I\u2019m pleased to say that the price point is justified. The developers used not only stable emulators for all the games \u2013 some of which date back to the late 1970s (the Noid comes to mind as does Archon) \u2013 but have the proper controller combinations to allow you to play your favorites on a system that has the hand feel of those ancient machines of digital days past.An important note is A= select or go forward with the process B= go back and the triple Dotted menu button is where the search and access to other directories of the menu are to be found.The collection of games covers a little over 30 years of gaming history and the styles run from the simple pixel art of the 70s/80s to the graphics of the later Resident Evil installments for Gameboy and Xbox 360. Which brings up another important point. The gaming system shows you which emulator it is using for which games so that you can determine which switches/buttons are active for the game you are playing.The ultimate takeaway for this is that the system does outperform its cheaper competitors. It is not, at present, positioned as a direct challenge to any of the other new hand held gaming systems that work with proprietary titles and connect for online play. There is an online play option and there appears to be a great deal of expanded capacity for future title and emulator editions should they product head in that directions. The systems does have the capacity to save games so that you can work through campaigns without have to always start from the beginning which is for me the primary use of the available memory. For now if you are buying this as a gift it is for your hardcore gamer who likes to go back and play some classic arcade, home gaming systems, and handheld systems from 20 to 30 years ago. It is also a good gift for the person who keeps bragging about what kind of game they had back in the day. As someone who is as embarrassed by the quarters I fed into machines as a teen as I am about my performance playing Missile Command, Q*bert, Pac Man, Total Recall, and Resident Evil 3 on this I can attest to the fact that it is a chastening experience. Remembering how exactly you got to the point that you know which way to \u201cclick\u201d a character to time a jump or which controller option gives you the most responsive play is an amazing kind of time travel.",
