This is actually better quality than the AtGames flashback portables. It's a bit heavier and the sound is much better. It just feels like better quality. The only thing the older AtGames version has over this is the SD card slot that lets you add roms so you can basically play any game you want on it (atari 2600 games, that is). If this had the SD slot, it would be perfect. Aside from that, it's great for the price.",

But at the end of the day it's a decent handheld for either kids or ATARI enthusiasts",

                "reviewText": "I own a few of these, mostly as fun little time wasters. The most recent wave seems to have some issues with quality control.I recently ordered and received two units, Megaman and Street Fighter II.Street Fighter arrived first, and does not power on. I tried using batteries and a USB-C power source. It\u2019s out of stock so I can\u2019t get a replacement. I reached out to the manufacturer to see what they can do, but they have yet to respond.Megaman arrived two days later, and I kid you not\u2026it\u2019s also defective. I included a picture of Megaman. The unit powers on, and the sound and controls work fine, but the screen itself is defective.Whatever changes they\u2019ve made to QC is really going to hurt their reputation, and seeing as these are both Capcom licensed units, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it damaged their relationship with them.Avoid if possible.EDIT: After getting a hold of them via social media (yeah, they wouldn\u2019t respond to their emails) I\u2019m being told they\u2019ll take care of these two units in 6-8 weeks.Buyer beware.",
