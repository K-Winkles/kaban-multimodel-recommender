I thought it would be a nice little gadget for playing old classics. As other reviewers have said, the controllers are bad quality, and the navigation is confusing... but it does offer an extreme amount of games. After playing Ms. Pac Man for about a week, the game started crashing. None of the C-64 games work. One week after that, the whole system will not boot. It starts up at the splash screen, goes through it's setup phase, and never completes, it just hangs. Returned it asap.",

You need to hit the center button & \"Start\" to get out of a game.2.) You use the B button for most things in the menu, not A.3.) I CANNOT figure out how to add games to \"Favorites\" so I spend a LOT of the time finding the games rather than playing them.4.) There are A LOT of files in here, and as expected a lot of repeats, bad copies & just non-working files.. But anyone who has ever bought an emulator like this should know that.5. ) While the controllers included do work, they are not great. I had much better luck with a Generic Microsoft controller.All that being said, I am satisfied with my purchase. I got all the old 8 bit games I wanted along with a bunch of MAME favorites. And it is fun poking around to see what else is on here. Just be aware that the NEWER the game is, the less likely it will play well, and the majority of the PC games included are garbage. My best advice would be to watch one or more reviews of this on YouTube so you know what you are getting into. And be SURE to backup the SD card ... just in case !",

                "reviewText": "This is a very nice retro console. It has more games than you could probably play in a lifetime! I previously put together RetroPi's , but this has more resources on it to run quite a bit more like the SNES games. Some of the games you have to tweak in the settings to get them to play a little better, but the software for this will let you customize a lot of settings. It takes up very little space compared to most gaming consoles. My only gripe would the the sd card adapter is a USB stick adapter (I can see this as you may want to 'side load' games from your computer). It would be nice if it also had an SD port on the main unit.",

NONE of the Play Station games work, not one. Everyone gives an error. Between that and the games that don't seem to work with the controller the actual amount of games is significantly less than advertised. Also, why is SSH turned on by default?",
