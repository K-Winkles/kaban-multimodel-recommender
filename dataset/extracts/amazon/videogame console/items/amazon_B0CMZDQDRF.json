They wanted to connect it to the big screen TV. My daughters av cord broke off in the tv soon as I plugged it in and now it's stuck. So I grabbed my son's cord and plugged it into my tv in my room, it connected well but none of their controllers work. So while it's connected she has to use the gameboy to controll it not the remote like it's suppose to...only reason I'm not sending it back is because she's enjoying it. But it's my money that paid for it and if I pay for something I expect it to work how my card worked to pay for it.",

The Dpad wouldn't register at up and right angle, the buttons had a slight delay. in an intense game the plastic was thin enough that I thought my thumb might punch thru the whole unit. DOES NOT have 400 games. maybe about 130 until it starts duplicating, or having the same game, but in Chinese and Japanese. After day 5 the charging port snapped off the circuit board. I considered fixing it, but in the end I don't think it's worth it, I got my 15 bucks out of it for all the Mario I played. I am certain I spent at least that much in a single day at the arcade in quarters as a kid. I wouldn't buy another one though, I think I'll do an upgrade with the thumbsticks and PS1 games.",
