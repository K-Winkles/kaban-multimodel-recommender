                "reviewText": "It\u2019s a knock of Nintendo with games already built in. The graphics are like a play station 2. Not bad at all. But I will say the steps to get to a game are a little harder for younger kids. So many clicks to get there. The buttons are backwards too. A is like X. But over all I think my kid will love it for Christmas. I git it as a test to see if he\u2019ll take care of it and next Christmas he can get a real Nintendo. Came with half charge. Came with a charger and cheep ear buds.",
