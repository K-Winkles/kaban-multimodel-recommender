My kids broke the controllers, I saw this listed on Amazon and decided to give it a try.-the remotes lag, big time-the games that are on the SD card are absolute trash and not nostalgic to any OG Nintendo games-im a huge Nintendo fan, and I had never even heard of these poor quality games-when plugged in behind a TV in an HDMI (like most things), the transmitter lags severely during game play.Only good thing is, the controllers worked with the old stick I already had bought from the Florida website a couple years prior. Kept the controllers, threw this game stick directly in the trash.Don't waste your money, this is a crap product",

There is a lot of artifacts and pop up screen distortions. They only last a few seconds but they are constantly showing up in some games. Not sure if its the emulator or the under powered game stick. The controllers are good and you do get two for co-op play. Very fun with lots of nostalgia and glitches.",
