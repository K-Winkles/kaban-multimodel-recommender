                "reviewText": "I bought this for my 6 year old son for Christmas - initially - he loved it! But I had to trouble shoot and find the games for him - even start each new game for him because there's no obvious button to navigate the device. That got old really fast... but on day 2 when the audio stopped working entirely - I decided to return it and buy the same thing again to see if it would be better. The new game arrived and had totally different games on it - (after a long time of searching and pressing a billion buttons randomly). After 1 day, the up and down buttons stopped working - making it impossible to actually play a game. Another return. Super disappointing because this would have been perfect for travel. But it just doesn't work and even the instructions basically say you just have to mess around with it to find games and get them to work. Very strange. Don't waste your time and money.",

Other than the titles on the home screen the built in games are worthless. I have a big ROM library but they only really work for GB/GBC/GBA/NES/SNES. The Genesis games work but I could not all the buttons work so only Sonic is worth downloading. There is a settings field to adjust the controls but it would not let me set up certain buttons and is worthless. I also purchased a 32GB memory card but when it was installed the system would not start or crash if it was on. Music also works but you have to use folders and again, no search function. Good for small(test 4GB micro SD card) external games(you load ROMS) but only for GB/GBC/GBA/NES/SNES.",

Many of the games are duplicates or different versions of the same game so I\u2019d say the real number of games is closer to 500 with half of these being Japanese only. But that doesn\u2019t matter since you will probably just download the games you actually want to play which is really easy.The main problem I\u2019ve had with this handheld is that after charging for the recommended 4 hours I get less than 45 minutes of play of time before needing to charge again. I made sure I\u2019m using a 3.5 v plug. So I\u2019m guessing these thing have a terrible battery or I just got a bad batch.",
