Please be careful tho because the directions are NOT clear as to where and how the wires connect. Once you get the wires all connected and working perfectly the game has some lagging depending on the game that you go into but overall most of the games all work some of the picturing all the directions are different but overall it\u2019s great.

However, there's no space bar key on the search keyboard (I haven't seen one as yet), which can be a bit frustrating when spelling out a game title. If a game title pops up (Search Menu) with multiple titles, the emulator class will change once highlighted. You can then select the game file you want to play based on its emulator. Sometimes you'll have to manually search the selected class emulator to find a specific title you're looking for.",

Overall the picture is great and the size of the game stick is convenient for small places and to travel with it everyhwere. I think is a bit overpriced. It is not 4k, I knew that from the start but being Hdmi did helped the picture a bit. I would recomend but those wireless controllers laged too much. Hope others get some luck in not getting a faulty one. Overall great with all the games it has. \ud83d\udc4c",

                "reviewText": "First, this is ONLY 4K. Doesn't even work on a non-4K HDTV (despite it saying it does). Hardly any of the games work, and the ones that do strangely stop working with time. The controllers do the same. Adding games is incredibly difficult, too. The format is some obscure Chinese type that is VERY difficult to use with USA computers or OSs. It's not as easy as just \"adding games\". There is not an \"OFF/ON\" switch, so you just unplug it. Startup takes FOREVER. The games included mostly suck, too. Overall, not worth the money because it's unpredictable and the included SD card isn't even compatible with most non-China OS PCs. This is why people don't trust the products made in China.",
