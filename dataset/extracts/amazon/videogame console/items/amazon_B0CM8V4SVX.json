My girlfriend needed something to destress by playing games. So she opened up and struggled with the whole thing. Instead of destressing she stressed was out. The console buttons at times just didnt work. When she tried to access the other games installed she couldn't open them to play. I regret getting this imitation of nintendo. Not worth the money and I returned it. Not making this mistake again.",

                "reviewText": "This item was embarrassing. You are better off buying a \"Nintendo switch hand held only\" console for $199 than this thing. The menus on this were very difficult to maneuver and the game resolution was virtually unreadable with many of them even in Chinese. That all makes the nice big screen worthless. Dont waster your time on this - I returned today!",
