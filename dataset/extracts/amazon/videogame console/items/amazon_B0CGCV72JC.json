One has to go to scraper settings, scrape for games with missing files. Then reload game list. This might take a bit of time but well worth it!!!! This product is truly awesome. A bit technical but awesome! I like technical!!!",

                "reviewText": "So it looks like they bought some 500gb portable drives and flashed the image of all these games to it. There's a ton to choose from, from most of the classic consoles (and some you probably haven't even seen). Controller support is good, but this is all stuff you could get yourself if you are familiar with the concept. The software it runs is free and licensed for non-commercial use, so on top of the possible legality issues with the roms, there's the issue of selling that software.There's also the obvious and hopefully apparent risk of plugging in modified hardware to your computer. I did only very cursory scans and found nothing, but hacking stuff has advanced a lot over the years and now even USB cables can be modified to steal your data. I have no idea if this hard drive is doing that or if these are good spirited pirates trying to make some cash. This is a very cool idea, and I wish it was all legal, but I'm not sure that it is.If you've seen the tiktok videos of those viral handheld gaming consoles this is running the same software front end and thus it looks very similar, the difference here is that it'll run on your PC, which means you'll need to have a powerful enough PC to run all the emulators smoothly, your performance may vary greatly depending on the hardware you've got.",
