After searching and comparing similar products we chose this one specifically because it was described as having \u201c777\u201d games compared to the 620 games most of the others had. We paid extra shipping to ensure its arrival in time for the holiday only to receive it and find out that it has 620 games like all of the rest of them. Disappointed that the item does not have the additional games as advertised and that we essentially wasted money on shipping that we could have saved if we had order this same product from a different seller.",
