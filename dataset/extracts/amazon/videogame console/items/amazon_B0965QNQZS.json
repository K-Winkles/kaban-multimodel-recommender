                "reviewText": "This was my 2nd purchase of a Kinhank system.The first was a different model bought from an Amazon competitor - I was convinced it was broken. I couldn't get my controllers to work and I had no help from that competitor's customer service (and Google was coming up empty for my troubleshooting issues.)Soo I bought this system instead.Then the same dang thing happened - Controllers were not working.However, this Amazon vendor's customer service was amazingly responsive & helped me step by step troubleshoot this thing, until we got it to work.The culprit - Rechargeable batteries.DON'T USE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES with this!Once I popped in normal ones, the controllers worked great and we've been gaming ever since.Loving this little system :)",

                "reviewText": "I was really impressed with the time it took to get the item. While the system itself was really plug n' play, the game selections menu and UI will need great familiarity for a noob to retro gaming to find working games. There is a ton of duplicates hence I think the 117K games vs the 50K games are basically the same so I feel a bit disappointed in that sense that I paid considerably more for what is essentially the same thing. Configuring the controllers is a pain as the slightest mistake will result in having to redo the entire process! And what's more frustrating is that it does not seem to save the configuration even after you set it all up! Adding games to the favorites list is also hit or miss, mostly miss as it just won't add them when pressing Y. But the biggest issue that I have seen is that in the 3 times that I have used the Super Console X Pro, when I use it for more than 10 minutes and trying to shut it down from the MENU, it just gets stuck and hangs on 'Saving METADATA...' and I end up having to power it down using the power buttons\u2014- update \u2014discovered that none of the nintendo DS games load due to an error. reached out to tech support, nine of their instructions worked. took out the microsd for the first time to try and backup before attempting a restore. discovered that the disk was read-only! i am unable to add/ remove roms as they claim! having to wipe out and restore a read only disk means doing all the work that i tried to avoid when i bought this. trying to see if amazon will help get me a new preloded microsd but so far it looks like i\u2019m gonna be stuck with a brick!",

                "reviewText": "I am firmly in the demographic that the Super Console X Pro was made for. That is - the person who wants plug and play emulation without the hassle of dealing with building my own Raspberry Pi system. The Super Console X Pro delivers on this front. The system booted right up upon first try and there are 50,005 games across a wide variety of retro systems and old arcade games. There is a lot of shovel ware. Many selections flat out don't work. Some are systems you wonder why anyone bothered to emulate. (Virtualboy, anyone?) But there are a lot of winners as well and, even when you account for everything I just mentioned, there are still -- literally -- THOUSANDS of games to choose from. The fun my kids and I have had playing Street Fighter II, Gauntlet and more has already justified the price of admission. The included bluetooth controllers are a cheap and laggy, but still serviceable for a lot of old school games. I have heard that wired controllers will alleviate lag but am not sure I want to invest more money into what is a down-and-dirty, cheap emulator. The operating system is inscrutable but there are ample videos on Youtube that can show you how to pair controllers, change emulation settings, update firmware, etc. Bottom line is this is about as \"plug and play\" as you are going to find if you want a relatively hassle free emulation experience. It's far from perfect but, if you accept it for what it is, you can have hours of retro gaming enjoyment.",

                "reviewText": "This is the one to buy!I did a lot of research to find a simple plug and play retro console with the most games and watched a bunch of reviews on YouTube about these type of consoles, I am extremely happy with this unit! I got the 256gb version with two PlayStation like controllers and everything works as I hoped it would.The seller was quick to respond with a question I had and resolved it right away!If you're looking to simply plug something in and not mess around with a bunch of settings this console does that. It has every classic game I was looking for also playing with two players works flawlessly.I definitely recommend the super console x pro for anyone looking to play the classic game's you grew up with. And for the price it's totally worth it to have all these consoles & games all on one device.",

The controls on a most of the games are messed up you have to try to manually insert the controls and they don't match the controls displayed so it is very confusing. Overall it is cool I don't think it is priced right for the many issues it has and how confusing it is.",
