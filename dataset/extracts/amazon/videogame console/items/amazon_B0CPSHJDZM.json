                "reviewText": "Unit is ok. D-pad and buttons feel mostly responsive but very mushy and not clicky at all. Comes preinstalled with a Nintendo System on a chip and several ROM's. Most of the games seem to work and the screen is acceptable but has a fair amount of light bleed. Even at this price, would have expected a bezel with a pad to help with this. . Unit is cheap and feels the same. The Nokia type rechargeable battery it runs on is very easy to find if you need a spare or replacement. The menu music is super annoying, however you don't buy a cheap portable China 8 bit nintendo emulator for menu music. If you want an inexpensive, ok distraction this would do the trick. Kids would likely love it. As a bonus, unit comes with a headphone jack so silent play would be an option for those long trips.",
