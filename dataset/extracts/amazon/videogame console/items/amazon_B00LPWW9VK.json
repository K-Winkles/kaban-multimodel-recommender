Every time it's one of those three. I bought it at the end of August and didn't get it out of the packaging until November so I was already out of the return window.As a secondary note, the controller it comes with is a wired controller, which is not what I expected or wanted.I get that these things are a decade old, but I bought this as a backup to my original 360. My original 360 went out, I started using this one, and it's going to give out any day.Update: a week later and now it won't connect to the internet and I have to turn it off and turn it back on before I can actually turn it on. And i have to go through initial setup (pick your language, country, etc) every single time i turn it on. This thing is not renewed. My old Xbox worked better than this.",

Now, two things I didn't like, and I had to make a little adjustment: 1) Surprisingly, it came with the 3 color connectors which brings back memories when I played GameCube, N64, PS1, you name it, but my TV doesn't support it, I mean nowdays most TV's and consoles have HDMI ports now, so luckily i had an HDMI chord laying around somewhere, I used it. 2) the controller, specifically the left stick, so when I started playing games, it rotates fine, it doesn't lay on one side, but when you press it down, it doesn't work and I tried it few times. So for some games, I had to go to Options and picked a different buttons layout that I'm more comfortable with and practice few times until I get good as I was.",

It started right up, came with an HDMI cable, cable for that big battery pack, power cable, and also no batteries for the 1 controller but it came with a a plug for the controller. My old 360 took a dump on me and I got this one. It was too much to fix. This worked out to be a great replacement. I bought the 2 year warranty as I do not know how long this will last. If anything all computers/electronics go bad within the first year. It did not come with instructions but that's ok I didn't need them. It has built in WiFi and that was a upgrade from my old 360. I'm going to attach the \"memory pack\" from my old 360 for more storage. I played Rainbow 6 Vegas 2 last night on it and it brought back some great memories from years ago. I keep the 360 in my room and I have an One S in the living room, both are for the kids when they come to visit. Over all I'm happy with my purchase and you will be too.",
