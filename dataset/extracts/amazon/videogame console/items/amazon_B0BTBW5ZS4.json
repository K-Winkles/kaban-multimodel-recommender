You have to make sure the batteries are put in, the small card put into the system and have the hdmi plugged in correctly. Also, there is a switch on front of controller that turns it on and off. Yes, some of the games are labeled incorrectly but if you look at the picture of the game as well you will figure that part out. Yes some of the wording is in Japanese but it does not affect the game playing. I am reliving my childhood playing Mario, Milipede, Pac Man and Mrs Pacman, Donkey Kong and so many more I have yet to dive into. There are many I don't play but there are a ton I do play. Every great once in awhile it might freeze but you just restart it. No big deal! I love it and recommend it to everyone! :)",
