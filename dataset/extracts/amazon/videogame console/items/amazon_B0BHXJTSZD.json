                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Brutally Hard and Unbelievably Fun",
                "reviewText": "The rumors are 100% true, Cuphead is hard as hell. What I didn\u2019t expect was that a vast majority of the game was what one would consider to be boss battles. You can play on Simple or Regular mode, and I\u2019ve been playing on Simple thus far. I can tell you, it ain\u2019t simple. I\u2019m not a fan of games that are purposely difficult to match the lack of content. Mega Man 11 springs to mind. MM 11 was extremely hard in later levels, but it also wasn\u2019t enjoyable for me. Once I finished a level, I never wanted to play it again. The game felt unfair rather than challenging. Cuphead feels hard but fair and after I fail, I immediately want to try again and again and again.There are times that I can play for an hour or two and not beat a single level. However, I do feel like I\u2019m getting closer. It\u2019s about pattern recognition and learning how enemies behave. It reminds me actually of Punch Out in the memorization of patterns and although it maybe not require the same perfection of timing that Punch Out asks for, it\u2019s harder in that it\u2019s less predictable than Punch Out. In Cuphead, you can also have two, three or four attacks coming at the same time from different directions, so you need to do some serious mental multitasking. There are even the occasional bullet hell sections. If you\u2019re looking to improve your eye hand coordination, it would be hard to find a better training ground than Cuphead.The gameplay is excellent but what really sets Cuphead apart is the unforgettable art style. I do wonder if they didn\u2019t draw a tiny bit of inspiration from the 2012 Skullgirls which had a little of the classic Disney vibe with a hefty dose of horror to it, but Cuphead takes it all the way. There is constant artifacting on the screen as if it were from an aged film reel. The music all sounds realistically old and even a bit muffled. Even the announcer voice sounds like it was recorded on a mic from the 40s. The backgrounds and bosses all look like they were animated in the 1930\u2019s or 40\u2019s. This is truly one of the coolest looking games I have ever seen.As hard as the game is, it is possible to make it much easier. You can purchase alternate weapons including one that shoots bullets that chase the enemy to allow you to focus on dodging. I also, for the longest time, didn\u2019t realize I had an EX meter to deliver a powerful strike. That was my own dumb fault. You really need to get the buttons to become second nature to beat some of the bosses. Thus far I\u2019ve managed to beat every boss on Simple and a handful on Regular in order to get their souls. To get to the final boss you need to beat every boss on Regular and that is going to be a helluva task. I may not accomplish it, but I\u2019ve had a great time thus far trying.",
