I have a gaming laptop, so I could by-pass some of the other files, but came with instructions so wouldn\u2019t be hard anyways. Played a few hours when it arrived to make sure it all worked. It\u2019s going in my laptop bag for trips. Great piece of hardware! Thanks!",

                "reviewText": "I am not happy with this item.The first time I used this item was simply to test for function. This item is NOT plug and play, as I noticed several things wrong. None of the 3DO games worked at all, and I didn't spend the time to mess around with that console. (Note that other reviews have mentioned this problem with the 3DO ROMs as well.) None of the PS1 games worked at all. Changing the default emulator got most of the games I tested to work, but there were more problems because the bios files for PS1 do not load. NES and Genesis ROMs worked fine. I tested Breath of the Wild on Switch, and that game will repeatedly crash within the first few minutes (but Tears of the Kingdom seems to run fine). Lastly, some of the games I tested for Dreamcast were not in English even though the ROMs were listed as USA (i.e. Sonic Adventures).The second time I used this item I started by testing N64. The emulation seemed to work fine, but the controller settings were very messed up by default. Then I tried to test Gamecube. I started with Bloody Roar and was watching the intro video when a black screen popped up that said \"Disc cannot be read.\" That notice remained on the screen for a few seconds before the emulator crashed and all of LaunchBox crashed. The hard drive also disappeared from all of my available devices. After that, I could not get the item to work again. I retried the hard drive in several different ports with different cables, and even on a different PC. Nothing. I tested all possible components and everything worked other than the hard drive. The LEDs on the hard drive enclosure light up, so it is getting power, but the drive will not read. So the drive is dead... after less than 2 hours of use.Maybe I got a lemon, but I would avoid this item.*** UPDATE ***I applied to return the item for a refund. The seller was very quick to contact me regarding my problems and offer support. With the seller's help I was able to isolate the problem to the hard drive enclosure and not the actual hard drive. (For those who care, the hard drive used in this product is a name brand Toshiba.) The seller has offered to send me a replacement enclosure. Hopefully this item will function after replacing the hard drive enclosure.*** UPDATE ***I am updating my review from 1-star to 4-stars. The seller supplied a replacement hard drive enclosure and upon initial testing the item seems to be working now.This really is a nice product that can provide countless hours of enjoyment. However, I cannot give it 5-stars because there are just too many small issues. As I said earlier, this item is not really plug-and-play. Be warned that you need to have a basic knowledge of emulation because you will have to tinker to get things running correctly. (Please read my initial review for some of the issues I encountered during testing.) Even if you cannot get everything working though, you will have access to more than enough content to make it an enjoyable experience.Also, if you read other reviews you will notice that different customers report different problems. I had some issues that other reviews did not mentions. Some of the issues mentioned in other reviews worked perfectly fine for me right out of the box. I believe this is because every customer is using this hard drive on a different PC with different hardware, updates, drivers, and settings. So everyone user's experience will be different, and that is why you have to have the knowledge to troubleshoot issues.",
