It has plenty of games to choose from. On the flip side, there is no instructions on how to play the games and the games on the system are not well known so many of the games we just couldn't figure out how to play. Which makes the kids lose interest very quickly. For the price, it was just ok and served its purpose on our long drive on our family vacation.",

                "reviewText": "Simply put, as an adult who has gamed most of his life, I hate this thing. Now, for kids the slower pacing may be beneficial as their reaction times need to grow and develope.If you remember free Flash Media games from the late 90s, you will be at home. The game selection is broken down to essentially derivative versions of classic 70s and 80s simple arcade games. There are minor variations of Hang On, Breakout, Space Invaders, there is even a pseudo Bomberman?!?!?, and other simple input \"puzzle\" games. Then there are aiming (Gallery) games that are either very grindy, or outright broken. There is the old windows version of Free Cell?!?! Very convoluted in how the games are labeled. Some games are D-pad only, and you need to figure that out for yourself.What I really am irked at is:-4 button layout and some games ask for letters which aren't there. And I feel it is actually only a 2-button layout-Slow, slow, slow gameplay.-No instructions for the games.-Some games I cannot even find the interaction for.-The included \"fidget wheel\" that I just... I don't get it.-Games don't tell you what, or if, the buttons do.-Some games have a well known name like Frogger, and it is not Frogger.-Point and Click games exist here. And that feels very slow as you have to use the D-pad.This indeed does have a place for players who need more time with games. That is the only audience I can see this for. But then there are no instructions on how to play the variety of games, some of which I only know because of my long history with 80s games.I can akmost defend some of the games provided as classic arcade style games, but wading through to find them was annoying. It was a rollercoaster for this review when i found Free Cell, and it operated like the Windows 3.1 version! This is a Buyer Be Warned situation for me.",
