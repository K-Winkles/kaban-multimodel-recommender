There are a lot of Activision games on this one which I love. And it\u2019s a small unit so it doesn\u2019t take up a lot of space. The joysticks work great. There does seem to be a little bit of latency with the paddle games, but nothing that\u2019s a showstopper. Definitely worth the price. I would be surprised if they could ever do better than this one! THIS IS DECEPTIVE ATARI GOLD!",

                "reviewText": "I think I can comment on the Flashback 12 Gold as an owner of this, the Atari 2600+, Atari Gamestation Pro and the Atari VCS. The good things about this console are Great Game Line up with the ability to add more games, the controllers are surprisingly very good, while not as still as the 2600+ CX40's I actually play better with these sticks even in the 2600+. Compared to alot of Atari tribute products out there, this one has a big Activision library, and as anyone knows, Activision and Imagic pretty much made the best Atari games, then you throw in Solaris and Aqua Adventure which are two of my favorites and you got a real winner. I can't overstate enough for 2600 games this is the best value by far, you cannot get 2600 games and authentic controls anywhere else at this price. I rank the 2600+ and the Flashback Gold very high for what they are and what they do, if you do not want to or plan on collecting carts this is the way to go, the gamestation pro offers wireless controllers but they are def not as nice as Atgames controls, the GSP doesn't offer a microsd slot to sideload tons of games though, but you can easily do the same here with a splitter usb cable and usb stick, its all in what you want to do but out of the box for 2600 games this blows the GSP away and I own 2 GSP's... I mainly use my GSP's for on the go and quick gaming but for the real deal its 2600+ and Flashback 12 Gold. Hopefully Atgames can get us an Intellivision Gold with HDMI someday!",

                "reviewText": "So far this little console has been great. I was able to update the firmware after downloading it from their site and a couple of other tools. I watched a video on how to do it, and it worked perfectly.The games are great! The emulation plays the games just as well as they did on the original system. I was also able to use a USB flash drive and ROMs to play some of my favorite games that are not included with the unit. It took a little bit of work to get a couple of them to work. One had a name that was too long and the other just wouldn't run, so I got an alternate version (.bin vs the normal .a26). The ability to play games not included with the unit is FANTASTIC! And the console is so tiny!!! A picture really doesn't do it justice. It's smaller than my hand!The joysticks work perfectly, though they take a little bit of getting used to as they are a good bit looser than the ones I remember as a kid, and most definitely looser than the one that came with my Atari 2600+. The left joystick also has buttons on the front, which you might think will get in the way while playing, but they don't, and they come in very handy. No need to go to the console itself, save to turn it on to play and off when you're done.Now to the 'but'. It's the paddles. They're really tight. So much so that it doesn't take long before my hand starts to get tired. A matter of minutes. Maybe they just need to wear in. I'm glad they're not loose, but I do wish they were a good bit looser than they are. But they do work perfectly otherwise.So, were it not for the paddles the unit would get 5 stars. I'd give if 4.5 if I could, but I can't, so 4 it is. Other than the paddles, and again, they may just need to wear in to get a bit looser, it's a fantastic unit. Definitely worth the cost.",

The latency for the menu interface are equally horrible and honestly for the price I was expecting much better quality given the number of linux based emulators out there that can play these games interfaced with a homebrew styled menu flawlessly.

Las mini consolas son un objeto de colecci\u00f3n que todo jugador debe tener y sobretodo esa que jugaste y te trae recuerdos.Mi primera consola fue un Atari 2600. Por lo que cuando vi este nuevo modelo de la flashback dije esta si me gusta y rememora esas primeras jugadas.Es importante que sepas que hay 2 modelos, las diferencias son m\u00ednimas, yo compr\u00e9 esta flashback 12 modelo AR3080B que sali\u00f3 en Octubre, que viene con el logo original de Atari, hay otra versi\u00f3n igualita pero cambia el logo, la otra trae el logo 50 Aniversario y el modelo es el AR3080, esa sali\u00f3 en Julio 2023.La consola de verdad se ve genial, su puesta en marcha es sencilla, conectar y jugar. Viene en una caja muy bonita lo \u00fanico que deber\u00eda venir en al menos una bolsita protectora.Los mandos son tama\u00f1o real y con el conector serie. Los juegos van bastante bien.En resumen, sea por nostalgia o por colecci\u00f3n est\u00e1s mini consolas valen la pena. Se disfrutan un mont\u00f3n.",
