                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Lots of Games",
                "reviewText": "This pocket-sized game console is packed full of retro games (several thousand, including repeats) for many old devices and more games are available online from multiple websites. It contains both a native emulator and a RetroArch emulator to play titles, comes with a mini-HDMI port and a headset jack, has Bluetooth to connect controllers, mice, and keyboards, and WiFi to connect to other devices. It has Moonlight Streaming that allows it to remotely play games from a home computer. I did not try all these features: I use the handheld to avoid paying the high operating cost of my powerful gaming rig for fun-but-wimpy games.I am not a \u201cgamer\u201d nor familiar with \u201cretro\u201d (having worked \u201coffline\u201d during the years when the games were released), so my review is based on my perspective as a (beginning) user. I like the horizontal layout of this handheld with its twin joysticks, although the trigger buttons on the top corners are slightly awkward. Not all games run in every format; there are too many alternatives for me to quibble about such issues. The stereo sound quality is surprisingly good from the speakers. The video on the 3.5\u201d screen is clear, but there can be hiccups when playing through HDMI at default quality levels.The battery lasts for hours and recharges rapidly from a C2C (smart charging) connection: alternately, a USB A to USB C cable is included to connect to a 2A charger. There are two TF card slots: one \u201cinternal\u201d with the operating system and the supplied games; the other \u201cexternal\u201d for additional games. The console can run DOS games through the RA Emulator, using a USB hub to connect a keyboard and mouse, opening another world of gaming possibilities that I would not dare run on another device for fear of latent viruses, etc.A January 12, 2024, firmware update is available at the Google Drive address listed on the Anbernic website. The file, however, is about 50 GB and split into chunks that must be reassembled before being flashed to a 64GB TF card with Rufus or Etcher. I did manage to install the update and found that, while supporting two other Atari formats, the HDMI no longer functions so I do not recommend installing it. It is a resource to create another internal TF card should a card failure occur, however.I have spent too many hours with this console since it arrived, both playing games and playing with the gadget itself, and I must admit it has been fun.Full disclosure: I ordered this EWDGOES RG35XX H Handheld Game Console through the Amazon Vine program. As a user of the product, I have done my best to provide an honest review.",

                "reviewText": "Well, after having rated about eight of these (all completely different price points and form factors), I can say without a doubt that this one reigns supreme!Pros:- Beautiful, solid construction. I have other solid handhelds, but the RG35XX H both looks and feels very well made.- Clicky buttons with an excellent D-pad AND two very good analog sticks. I also happen to prefer the even, lateral placement of the analog sticks (Playstation style rather than Xbox style). Huge win for me.- Gorgeous 4:3 IPS screen. FINALLY, a 4:3 screen on a horizontal build! That means that this little guy is tailor made for older games (a true retro handheld). There's nothing worse than stretching a 4:3 image over a widescreen. None of that here. Also, the colors pop, backlight is adjustable, and this unit comes with a screen protector in the box.- MAJOR portability. This guy is thin, small and truly fits in your coat pocket.- Awesome emulation and GUI out of the box! I've counted 16 emulators, all of which have anywhere from 50 to 500 games each pre-installed on two removable SD cards. And, unlike many of these handhelds coming out of China, this one actually has a tremendous variety spanning all consoles and arcade games. Retoarch is beautifully integrated and has a dedicated toggle button. Anbernic RULES.- Great processing power. Every game I've loaded up works flawlessly so far (I've tested about 20 of them spanning all the different emulators). This \"H\" model is a major step up from the original RG35XX.- GAMES! Did I mention the games? SO many to choose from 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit and all the way up to Dreamcast and PSP. Finally an all-in-one retro handheld solution.Cons:- Despite its great portability, I do wish the form factor was just a bit larger to make it easier on the hands. I have average size hands (not big and not really small), and this little guy is good for about half an hour before I start feeling it.- Shoulder buttons, because of the handheld's overall small size, are difficult to implement while gaming. This isn't a huge issue as most games I'm playing don't even utilize them, but hardcore SNES aficionados, this might be more of a problem.In summary, out of the eight different budget handhelds (i.e., less than $100) I currently own, the RG35XX Anbernic is the ONLY one that checks all of the boxes. It's beautiful, it's portable and it's powerful. This comes HIGHLY recommended.",

                "reviewText": "Alright, listen up, fellow retro fanatic! As a casual gamer who loves reliving the classics, I recently got my hands on the RG35XX H, and let me tell you, it's been a trip down memory lane!**First off, this thing is tiny!** Like, seriously compact. It fits right in my pocket, which is perfect for those nostalgic gaming sessions on the go. Plus, the transparent purple color? Totally rad!**Booting it up, I was blown away by the library of pre-installed games.** We're talking thousands of titles from all my childhood faves: NES, SNES, GBA, even some PSP and PS1! No need for complicated downloads or messing with emulators, just pure plug-and-play bliss.**The 3.5-inch screen is decent. Not gonna lie, it won't win any resolution awards, but the colors are vibrant and it gets the job done.** Plus, the battery life is pretty solid, lasting me a good few hours per charge. Perfect for those long journeys or lazy afternoons reminiscing about pixelated adventures.Now, here's the thing. This little guy ain't a powerhouse. Some newer retro titles might chug a bit, but honestly, for the classics it was built for, it runs like a dream. And hey, if you crave that big-screen experience, you can even hook it up to your TV!Speaking of the sound, it's not bad, but it won't win any audiophile awards either. But hey, that's what headphones are for, right?Overall, if you're a casual gamer like me who craves a portable blast from the past, the RG35XX H is a sweet deal. It's got tons of games, it's easy to use, and it looks pretty darn cool. Just keep in mind the screen resolution and processing power if you're a hardcore retro head. But for nostalgic fun on the go? This little purple gem definitely scores high on my gamer meter!",
