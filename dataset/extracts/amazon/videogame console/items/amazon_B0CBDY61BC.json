                "reviewText": "I ordered my RG35XX over a week ago and received it last week. I had been watching videos and reading reviews and felt like it would be perfect for me. I grew up on NES, Game Boy, and SNES, and really only needed something that could do those consoles, but liked to have flexibility to go up to other systems like Dreamcast and Playstation. Initial reviews of the RG35XX were mixed; the stock firmware was choppy and had several QoL features missing (suspend/resume and a robust configuration option). I ordered when I saw that a new firmware, GarlicOS, was released and was having lots of positive reviews. I played the RG35XX for a couple of hours on stock firmware but decided I would really just want to get GarlicOS running.I'm glad I did! Garlic works great on the system and it's really easy to navigate and use. The form factor of the device is just perfect for me. I got the one stylized like the original Game Boy and it feels really great, very close to the original. It's smaller in the hands with a bigger screen, but it's not TOO small like the Miyoo Mini (in my opinion) nor too bulky. It's portable enough to take with you in a case, throw it in a bag, etc., and the battery life is decent. Because it has trigger buttons, it can play the newer generation games, but I've been having too much fun playing NES and Game Boy games to need them. But they are very comfortable to use.I strongly recommend this to anyone looking to see what all the fuss is about for retro handhelds. This has an easy entry into the market, isn't terribly expensive, but has good build quality and style, and enough performance to play anything a child of the 80s and 90s would want.",

                "reviewText": "After searching so long and trying different retro emulators etc THIS is amazing. I included photos of gear and the item during game play. A lot of people take a lot of time to figure out how to utilize the wired and wireless options.Update: there\u2019s a Bluetooth receiver available on Amazon that you can hook up to a usbc-usb adapter and this will allow you to use a Bluetooth remote like the 8bit retro controllers perfectly. You may need to map some of them keys but yeah. Strictly speaking the 2.4ghz remotes I was unsuccessful with. The buttons were completely mapped wrong or just wouldn\u2019t work so. Down side to it.To use the tv hookup you need an hdmi/mini hdmi cable. Plugs in effortlessly and instantly connects to your tv.Wired/wireless controller usage- wired you need an older remote with usb capabilities like the pink one you see in the photos. You\u2019ll also need a male usb-c to female usb adapter as also shown in the photos. Hook all that up and the wired controller is great. But not all controllers are equal and it depends on their wares. As for wireless, I\u2019m still working on it, I just got this today.All in al, solid awesome piece of equipment",

Some people complain about this particular device not having Wi-Fi, but for a retro console I\u2019m not sure why that\u2019s a problem.My only real complaint is that it seems to have trouble maintaining safe states and save files get corrupted in the Pok\u00e9mon games in particular (my wife finally gave up trying to play through Yellow).All in all, I should buy a couple more of these things, they are good glorious fun and you can lend them to friends on game nights. Need a replacement anyway, my son threw it and the screen broke, but that\u2019s my fault for letting a three-year-old get his hands on it.",
