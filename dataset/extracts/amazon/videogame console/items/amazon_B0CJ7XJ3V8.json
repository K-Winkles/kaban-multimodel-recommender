                "reviewText": "The little plastic dot in the middle of the fan fell off almost immediately. It was easy to glue back in place, but I figured it was worth mentioning.Next, I highly doubt all of these games have been authorized. I feel sort of weird playing them because I think everything might not be on the up and up.There are tons and tons of games \u2013 old and new. Graphics are comparable to the hand held systems from a few decades ago, but quite acceptable. The fan is a fun addition, too.Navigation isn\u2019t the greatest, but it is decent. Figuring out how to play each game is sometimes a challenge, too, but the multiplayer options are nice.The physical build seems to be sturdy enough, and battery charge lasts a while.",
