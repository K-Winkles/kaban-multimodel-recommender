                "reviewText": "I have to drop my kids off at my sisters every morning and pick them back up after work for school with my sister living almost 30 minutes from me (it's a large school district!). So I was looking for something that they could use to entertain themselves in the car since they are to young for phones and always wanted to bring there pads and watch mindless tube videos (I hate that!). Plus what would happen is they would then constantly leave the pads in the car and I would have to figure out what to do with them in super hot or super cold days so they didn't get ruined. So when I came across this handheld game system I figured it was worth a try.This is actually pretty cool! It's rechargeable and lasts for a few days on a single charge, so I don't have to deal with cords in the car. There are also a TON of games on this thing, though I will say not all of them are actually super fun or even in English. There is a fewGames on here that I feel like they just added so that they could say they had XX amount of games on it.Now it's a $20-$30 product depending on the day, so your obviously not getting amazing graphics or anything like that. It's more like the very first old school gameboys in terms of visual game quality. But it's still totally usable and my kids actually haven't complained about that at all which was surprising. Overall for the price it's not a bad deal at all! Much cheaper than buying something like a Nintendo switch and expensive games!",

This will be so helpful and has already provided a lot of entertainment! Lots of games to choose from, many different types of games also! We love that it comes with a controller for 2 player! My daughter loves the blue color and the battery stays charged! Highly recommend.",
