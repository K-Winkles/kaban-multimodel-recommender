                "reviewText": "There are some things to like about this device and a lot not to. The first one I received had a screen that flickered on and off making it unusable, but the second one I received was fine. I recommend spending a little more for a higher-quality device.Pros:- It does play games.- You will find some enjoyment playing the games.- It has some popular classic games already installed (more on that in the cons, though).Cons:- This plays mostly older games, so the 16:9 aspect ratio doesn't make sense. By default, it stretches 4:3 games, but you can set it to have bright white bars on the side instead. Neither are ideal.- It looks cheap and feels cheap (you get what you pay for).- The screen is just OK. The colors are not accurate and the contrast is poor, but it is usable.- The navigation is a mess. You have a few games on the main page, but most games are found by scrolling through a menu.- It really only comes with just over 1,100 games. These games are then repeated 10 times to make it look like there are 11,000. I'm not kidding. It's ridiculous.- Many games are not in English.- Some games are homebrew/hacks.- While I found some of my favorite retro NES games pre-installed (like Tetris), a lot of the big hits like Super Mario Bros are missing.- Battery life is just OK.- Controls are squishy. They work, but you'll wish they were better.",

                "reviewText": "This handheld console i nice because it has a ton of different games to choose from. However not all the games are easily played. I have run in to several so far that despite all the console settings being set to English, the games dialogues and directions are still displayed in a foreign language and cannot be changed. This makes it difficult for my kids and myself to fully enjoy playing as we have a hard time figuring out how to play and cannot follow along any of the story lines.Despite the language barrier in some games the others are easy to figure out and are in English. The console does not seem to save any of the game progress as it would make you believe, so any time the game is closed it will have to be started over from the beginning.Overall it was still a good find as its perfect to keep my kids occupied and is small, lightweight, and rechargeable so it can easily go in the car and on any longer trips.",
