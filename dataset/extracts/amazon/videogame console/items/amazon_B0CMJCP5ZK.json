                "reviewText": "So many generations of Retro gaming made possible by the retro arch emulation engine modified to run on a small handheld that fits in the palm of your hand. This product is a new level of amazing as it combines a beautiful bright screen with dual analogs 4 buttons in the rear and 4 buttons + select start home, and a d-pad that isn't terrible for street fighter type games. The product is preloaded with many older games which all run rather perfectly except for maybe Dreamcast games.Couple of things to note. First unit I received ran beautifully but the R1 button was stuck and had to be depressed over and over to get it unstuck. Eventually I sent for a return and replace and it took almost 3 weeks to get a replacement, but the replacement is perfect and doesn't have this issue. Another note, sometimes games will not load and crash to the selection screen over and over and can only be resolved by hitting the small button on the right side of the handheld. It appears some games load something into the RAM that prevents other games from loading properly. So don't panic if a game doesn't load after playing a few games. The sound is extremely loud which can be adjust with the vol + and - buttons on the right side of the device.Overall I'm in love with this handheld and plan to purchase the other ones offered by this brand/seller. I highly recommend this handheld for retro, nostalgia, and attention to details. Due be careful with the buttons as they may not last a long time without care.",

                "reviewText": "I obviously haven't tried and testing all 15k games currently installed on the unit, but just picking some at random, they played with only relatively minor issues. I expected audio to be a big issue, and I suspect some of these titled will suffer some pretty rough sound glitches, but I haven't run into yet, so that's promising!Like others have noted, the screen is awesome. Did not expect it to be so bright and crisp!The biggest immediate issue I had was realizing that the controls on the unit won't match the control schemes of most games, so there will always be some trial and error to figure out the controls, but that is just the nature of it, and absolutely not a dig at the handheld itself.I do wish there was a better way to navigate the games. Having to scroll through hundreds or thousands of games is a bit much at times. A search function would certainly be appreciated. But that is just searching for things to complain about.Whether it is worth the price is debatable. I am a pretty casual gamer that grew up on a lot of these titles and just don't have any old consoles around that still work. For someone who was a die-hard fan of these games, it might be worth the price, but then again, they probably have the consoles and titles and won't be needing an emulator. haha.So far, I am pretty happy and I look forward to checking out some of these old games I haven't touched in over two decades!",

                "reviewText": "This handheld isn't only nostalgic but has all the capabilities to be such a great device. Unfortunately after having this device for about a week. Im running into issues left and right. Games not working and now the buttons are not working correctly. I thought it was just one game but it's multiple games in which the bottons act up.I would really appreciate someone reaching out. I don't want to give up on this product.",
