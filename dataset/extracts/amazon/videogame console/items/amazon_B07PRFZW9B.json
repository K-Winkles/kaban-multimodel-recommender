                "reviewText": "My 5 year old daughter had mentioned she wanted one of these for her birthday. I knew I didn\u2019t wanna spend much because she has a tablet with games and stuff so I figured I\u2019d find something cheap but still entertaining just incase she lost it or it got ran over by another toy in the house. This game console has been perfect. Looking at it it looks very cheap and it is but it has alot of basic games for kids my daughters age so it kept her entertained and the screen is of such crappy quality it was like the 90s again. (We didn\u2019t mind and my daughter didn\u2019t notice \u201cquality of the screen\u201d). The game is still working great. Has been tossed around a few times as well still holding up. If your looking for a cheap game console that you won\u2019t care if your kid ruins..look no further.",

You have to hit Reset to get out of the game, the Select button has not responded to anything, the screen goes black or scrambled on certain games,Also know that it does not come with a USB outlet cube, so you\u2019ll need to invest in oneThis is a Misrepresented item\u2026. I did contact Amazon\u2026and they gave me 50% back on the price and I did not have to return it\u2026if I wanted to return it, they would have taken it back and given me a full refund\u2026but I am a 24/7 care giver of my dying husband and didn\u2019t want to have to hassle a return\u2026.hint, hint\u2026.Target will give full refund and no return hassles\u2026.the reason I know this is because I have ordered from them and when the items is not up to par, they do not want their customers to have to deal with anything or be stuck with the item that is not as described\u2026they appreciate our purchases as customersI can not get out and about\u2026so I have to buy almost on line without actually touching or handling something one on one\u2026so as the luck of the draw goes\u2026I do come across an item that is not worthy from time to time, and really appreciate a company who responds wholly to that situation",
