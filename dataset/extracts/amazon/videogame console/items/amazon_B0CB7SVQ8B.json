Immediately it was like going back over 40 years ago to when I was a kid playing video games that still look like classics today, like Contra. The game console is plug-and-play. Although the graphics are not as good as those of today's games and are still 2D, I still like it very much. But the description is some kind of misleading, the game console cannot save game progress, and not support new games downloaded from the Internet. However, the pre-installed games are quite enough for me to play, which is very suitable for people like me who cannot handle the modern games out there.",
