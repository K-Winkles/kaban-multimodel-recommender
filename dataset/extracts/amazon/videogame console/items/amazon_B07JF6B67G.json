                "reviewText": "#1. There aren\u2019t 1200 games in this device. There are only 10 games in this device.#2. Once you launch 9 out of the 10 games, the language on the screen is no longer English but instead, it\u2019s in Chinese. So unless you can ready Chinese, it\u2019s pointless. I tried to go into the settings to change the language, but the settings were also in Chinese.#3 the one game that did have English instructions, didn\u2019t even work. You select play and then it just plays a video of the game. The directional controls or buttons have absolutely no effect on the \u201cgame\u201d. It\u2019s just a video. While this might be good for a 1 year old who you don\u2019t want to buy a more expensive gaming console for because all they\u2019re going to do is press buttons, this is not good for any age beyond that.#4 The handheld game console itself is very light weight. It seems to be made entirely of plastic like material. The graphics are very poor.. kind of like someone recorded over one of those old school VHS tapes or like someone sat in the movie theater and illegally recorded the movie.I was fooled because I only read a couple of reviews. However, if you pay close attention, many of the reviews aren\u2019t even about the \u201chandheld game console\u201d\u2026 they\u2019re about some birthday decorations and other things.I returned this \u201cgame console\u201d to Amazon expeditiously. I do NOT recommend. Save your $30 until you have enough money to buy a hand held gaming console from a reputable brand because this was a waste.",

                "reviewText": "If I had a zero, I would rate it that. First, very difficult to operate. This thing doesn\u2019t even come with Mario or Super Mario etc. that\u2019s the very minimum I would expect. There is no way, there are 1200 games built in. It shows other systems on there\u2026no way. It has NES, GB, and Famicon, but good luck finding any decent games from those. I have bought cheaper handhelds, that at least have the Mario games built in. I was expecting Sega games and Super Nes, because that\u2019s what is displayed. I went online to check, and I guess they have different companies that make these systems, and all showed different games, and in some case better. Save your money. I am returning this for a refund.",
