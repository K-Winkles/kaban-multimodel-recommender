                "reviewText": "Metal Gear Solid is that one game from my youth that really got me into video games. Aside from those repetitive (but fun) side scroller type games. MGS really brought story telling alive in a game. It\u2019s worth having all three of these titles remastered and rereleased BUT at least for the switch BEWARE that buying the digital version might be better if not the same as the physical edition. All 3 games HAVE to be downloaded! Which is to me is stupid because what is the point of having the cartridge? Once placed in the system you need to download all three games (and bonus crap) but then you still need the cartridge to play them! It just seems unnecessary and annoying for taking up so much space! Don\u2019t get me wrong it\u2019s worth having MGS and MGS3 back to play at my leisure. The memory thing is just something I wish I was made aware of before buying the physical version. like I started though, MGS is that game that got me into gaming. That alone is worth having it for. Plus you get three games which is hours/days/weeks of nostalgic fun. Makes me optimistic that one day MGS4 will be rereleased! That game only came out on ps3 like 15 years or more ago and has never been remastered or available on any of the next gen consoles. Maybe Hideo Kojima can influence that game to come out! \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb",

It forces you to download each game and you\u2019re unable to play the games fully without these downloads. (32 gb total according to back of box (pic included)).That coupled with Konami doing the bare minimum to get these games ported gets this a 1 star on the physical edition.Wait until it\u2019s on sale digitally, or if it drops down to super cheap for a physical then feel free to grab it.Otherwise, if you own these games in any other form don\u2019t bother with this one. The remasters don\u2019t make the games look any better than they did on original release, so this whole collection is a wasted opportunity turned soulless cash-grab.",

                "reviewText": "This is an amazing collection of some of the most influential games of our lifetime. I wish they had done a little more rather than just a 1:1 port for each title but I\u2019ll take what I can get. Never before has MGS (The first game) been on consoles (other than PS) not to mention the fact that it\u2019s portable on the Nintendo Switch. This is a great 5 game collection, however, there are a couple of caveats: 1. There is a MASSIVE download required for the physical version (almost 23GB) 2. The framerate targets 30fps, but doesn\u2019t always reach that mark. 3. This collection is on updated hardware but there is little on offer as far as upscaling resolution, and increased framerates (at least on the Switch version.) As a package, that includes tons of bonus, content, like graphic novels, lore literature, and PDF versions of the original game manuals, 5 complete games and even a couple of bonus modes for MGS1, it\u2019s a must buy for physical collectors, MGS fans, and newcomers alike. If you\u2019re a stickler for better graphics and increased framerates you may want to get it for one of the current gen consoles instead, but as a massive collector of physical Switch games I love this collection.",
