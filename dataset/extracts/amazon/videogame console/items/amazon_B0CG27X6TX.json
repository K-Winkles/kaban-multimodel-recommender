Yes, the Uberwith game box is an Android TV box, you can enjoy the TV function after linked network. When I connect the TV for the first time, the picture is stuck. How to solve it ? The first use requires a lot of game content to load, so there is a very small chance of stutter, you only need to re-plug the box power supply to solve the problem.",

                "reviewText": "The games that are there do work, of course it\u2019s impossible to play every one. I bought this hoping to have access to some old arcade games that I used to play back in the 80\u2019s.Some are there but not all. The down side of this system is it will say that there are 15,000 games in the MAME directory but after about 600 or so, they repeat, so it keeps duplicating that same 600 over and over again. It seems to do this in other categories as well.PS1 and N64 have about 100 in each directory.I apologize if I am forgetting anything but hopefully this review helps.So in conclusion, if you\u2019re really looking for truely 100,000 then this may not be the system for you. It has MAME, Super Famicom, GB, GBA, PS1, PSP and N64*** if you favorite any games it just throws them at the beginning of the directory and it also duplicates those over and over instead of putting them in a separate Favorite directory which is also disappointing.",
