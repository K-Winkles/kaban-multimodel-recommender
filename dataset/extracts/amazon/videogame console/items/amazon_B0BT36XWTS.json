They love it and the wife, and I get to re-live some of our childhood as well when the kids are in bed. Fun gift and works great.Tips:1) Make sure to purchase 8 AA batteries for the joysticks. The YouTube reviews showed their products with batteries included. This box does not have included batteries so make sure you have some on hand.2) Go to the manufacturer website and download the latest firmware for the unit. Several bugs were fixed and also better navigation in the menus.3) Buy a Micro SD card to save game states and also load 1000s of other games from the internet. There are YouTube videos that will show you how.",

                "reviewText": "First off, there are quite a few games included but unfortunately many of the best Atari arcade and console games were not amongst this collection. However, that is where the SD Card comes in. You can use 2600, 5200, and 7800, and other systems ROM images loaded on to the card.Before you start with the SD Card, ensure you update the firmware from their website. It includes a lot of enhancements as to the SD Card management. Most of all it allows you to use a folder structure. From what I have tested, most of the 2600, 520, and 7800 ROMs all work. I am not sure about the homebrew games, but I've read they are hit or miss.MAME Roms also work. However I am not sure what version of MAME emulation is being used so not all of my ROMs are loading. I'm mostly using older retro ROMS which the system can handle. I wouldn't try using ROMS from the mid 90's or later. The system is probably not powerful enough to handle most of those. I've gotten games like moon patrol, Elevator Action, Dig Dug to work, but other older games like Galaga don't load. I'm sure it is just the ROM version I have and that the correct one would load.I've also attempted NES, Colecovision, Genesis and Intellivision ROMS. NES and Genesis work (have to be extracted from the ZIP file) but I have not been able to get Coleco or Intellivision to work. In fact the directory shows empty when I point to them to try and load the games.The controllers I am not a huge fan of. Although they are similar in style to the Atari 2600, the button placement (especially the B) seems awkward to me. I've read people have been able to use other controllers but I have not tried yet. For basic games the controller is fine however. I do like how they integrated a paddle onto the controller as well. Another issue with the controller is that I have had a bit of latency once in a while, but most of the time it is fine.Overall definitely worth buying for a mini-retro console even though there are more powerful out there and it has a few quirks. Maybe they will continue to update features in firmware to enhance it even more in the future",

                "reviewText": "Be prepared to be underwhelmed. The joysticks are an abomination to use. The sticks have very little travel. The B button is positioned quite awkwardly on the top of the stick, and the C button is right where you'd grip the controller. The trackball emulator is alright for what it does, but it's awkwardly positioned on the upper right side of the stick.The emulation is fine, but you can do better with OSS and a PC. Which brings me to the real reason this gets ONE star (a half-star if I could). NO support for firmware update for Mac OR Linux users. So you must have a Windows machine to update the device.In 2023, it's not difficult to provide Linux support for firmware updates. It doesn't have to be simple, nor does it have to have a GUI, though it takes a TRIVIAL amount of work to make a Linux firmware tool. I have made them myself, and i have used them for other devices like keyboards and portable music players. It's a TRAVESTY that in this day and age, you have to keep a Windows 10 (or later) PC around to update firmware for things like this. It's a trivial job to do and nothing Windows has makes it \"better\" suited for firmware updates. It's as if My Arcade can't port things to Mac or Linux?Fine, if the programmers at My Arcade are not versed in Windows, hire some. But to avoid Mac too? That's tragic. This could've been a decent emulation station *IF* it had better support for the millions of enthusiasts who like retro gaming but do NOT own a Windows machine.Sad. You really duffed this one, My Arcade.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a way to play some Atari 2600 games I had as a child. There are two actual options, the Atari 2600+ and this one. While the 2600+ looks more authentic of course, you need to have cartriges to play. So the SD card option in the GSP was what made me buy it. I quickly looked at the preinstalled games, but I wanted to have my own collection. And it is really easy to do that, very happy that I can play the old stuff I have not seen for 40 years. It is more a nostalgic factor than really playing them for hours. For 2600 games, everythibg works well. You can also play 5200er and 7800er games, and I enjoyed the NES ones since they look and sound better, but the weak point here is the placement of the joystick button B and C, I wonder if the developers have really tried that. For me it is nearly unplayable. You can connect other controllers with a cable through, have not tested that yet.There are enough videos on YouTube on how to do all of that, so have a look there.In sum, for the price sold I think it is great, maybe they come up with a different wireless joystick design, that would make it perfect for all 2 button games.",

The joy sticks are super nice, maybe the best modern made retro joy sticks out there. Good game selection, I have most of the games already but there are few rare ones in there. The arcade versions are fantastic, Tempest is in there! It looks great on a large modern TV and the ability to load toms makes this a winner.",

Agregar juegos es tan sencillo como agregar una carpeta con el nombre Gamer y dentro de ella colocar las carpetas con las roms de cada consola.

You can set up the folders on a PC when preparing the SD card.Really recommend this system and the emulation is top notch.",
