There are a lot of games pre loaded and they are organized into types - puzzle or racing or sports, etc. I played through several with my kids and they were fun for a family game night. The cables ther come with the system are ridiculously short. The HDMI cable is a few inches long and the mini USB for power is maybe 6 inches. The power cable was the biggest pain point and required an extension cord with a USB plug to get it to work. My other quibble was the buttons on the controllers are labeled A B X Y but they are very hard to see and it slowed games down a lot as we got used to it. The labels are on the black buttons and are not colored so you have to hold them up to the light see. All in all a lot of games and fun once you get the cable situation sorted out.",

                "reviewText": "I got this on a lark. It listed a lot of games that I remember from my first gaming systems, and the hardware is updated for modern times. The main game \"console\" is essentially an HDMI dongle, similar to a streaming dongle. A short pigtail is included so you can plug it in without damaging the connector, and power is via a USB cable.Since my TV has a USB connector on the back, I was able to plug both connectors in conveniently. I was really impressed by the vivid picture as it came up. The games appear to be the original versions, and while they're not upscaled, the video output is 720P and looks great on the screen. Of course it's pixellated, especially on a giant TV , but it's no different than the original look.Two controllers are supplied, which is great for two-player games. One of the controllers has a joystick, while the other one has a 4-way switch. Some games are better with one or the other, which can make it awkward for some two-player games. The switches feel cheap and light, but they work nicely.The console has 219 retro games built in and hundreds of additional games on an included memory card. Th number is exaggerated somewhat as there are a few different releases of some games, but there are plenty to keep you occupied. I enjoyed the games as I remembered them from my past, but the kids had a great time with them too. They're easier to play and a lot less stressful than the new console games.",

                "reviewText": "This retro console runs on a dongle that you plug into any HDMI port. I find a system like this is really convenient and easy to travel with. The controllers are sturdy and offer an adequate comfort while playing games. The game offerings are average but as good as you can expect with something so small and lightweight. I was unable to get the sound synced up. However, the other reviews don\u2019t mention it, so I think the issue is on my end and not the product itself. The plastic material used to build the controllers is strong and durable. The D-pad is just okay and works decently. Overall, I had a decent experience with this console, it isn\u2019t the best but, it is very portable and works well; and comes in a super small form factor.",

                "reviewText": "It's a neat, sentimental, Nintendo emulator device... It works, comes with 200ish games on the device and another 800ish on the micro SD card. I tried adding one of my own to it, and it didn't show up in the menu though, so not sure what's up with that.I was able to play several games. The controllers sync up wirelessly easily, which was nice. Only thing is, the directional pad is horrible. It's uncomfortable, slow to react and just feels cheap and kind of 'off'.I haven't looked into it much to see if I can use any other controllers with it, and I got it mainly as a side project to toy with to see what kind of OS it has and what all types of games it would run. (officially only supports nes games)Not sure how legal this device is, but it had a legit looking listing and it's from Amazon, not some unknown site.So.. overall rating I gave a 4 star because it does look pretty cool, plugs into HDMI, doesn't use one of the old yellow rca video jacks, and does come with 1000 games and 2 wireless controllers.",

                "reviewText": "My son really likes the old school games included in this kit. The hdmi stick contains many classic Nintendo era games and some later games like Earthworm Jim which are a nice bonus. For some reason it won't work on my living room smart tv (which is one of the first smart tvs), but works excellent on other newer smart tvs in the house. You have to plug into an hdmi port as well as a usb port to power the hdmi stick, but newer tvs all have those options. The controllers work decent considering the price for the whole package and it's nice they are wireless. The controllers on/off switch on the back is a little difficult to slide due to not having much texture, but that's a minor issue.",

The internal games are not familiar to me at all but my kids still like them. The games on the TF cards are much better. There you will find classic Mario games, adventure island, donkey kong, balloon fight, excitebike, mortal combat and so much more. It's been a great playing these games with my kids and watching them enjoy games from my childhood.",
