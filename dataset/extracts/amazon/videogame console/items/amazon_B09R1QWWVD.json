                "reviewText": "Took about a minute to put together (probably actually less time.)The plastic feels quite sturdy and I am pleased with the ease of assembly! This fits perfectly on my entertainment center, and will allow me to display my game cases (and keep my games readily accessible) without needing to worry about taking up too much extra space! The only 2 (very minor) issues that I have with this product are: (a.) The rubber feet that are supposed to help it not slide around don't really do a whole lot - it feels like they just don't have any grip - and (b.) I'm not a massive fan of the way the rails feel when you slide your controllers in to charge them. Compared to other chargers, this definitely feels cheap, but it charges my controllers fine, so I won't knock off a star. Just being honest here!If you're thinking about purchasing this to help organize your switch accessories and games, go ahead and do it! It's a great buy!",

I have a couple ideas that i wish where added. one is have usb charging ports for the pro controllers so they can charge as they sit there doing nothing. Second is that the joy con controllers had a storage hanging place for the clip on pcs. otherwise we really enjoy this product and puts everything in one place.",
