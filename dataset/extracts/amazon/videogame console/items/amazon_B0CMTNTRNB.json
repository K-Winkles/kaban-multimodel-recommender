There are 2 different ways to open the emulators. The \"game room\" which i never had issues with, and then there was \"ra game\" which quickly became non working for me. No matter what game I clicked under \"ra game\", it would be basically bricked. The game would turn on but no buttons would work. I couldn't adjust the volume or start the game or anything. So I was forced to ask Amazon for a replacement and I hope this one doesn't have the same issues because otherwise, I was really enjoying using this system. We'll see what happens .",
