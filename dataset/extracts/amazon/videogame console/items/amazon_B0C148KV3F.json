A year in and still no VR headset for it. Also this does not run an approved version of android, while having play store support, not all apps will run on the portal. Another annoyance is that the Portal has a DRM issue and will not play any streaming movies from streaming services like Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, etc. Even movies anywhere will only play with sound only. Too many issues with such an expensive android gaming device. Had to return it unfortunately.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Superb device for retro gaming",
                "reviewText": "I own several emulation handhelds at this point. The Pimax Portal stands out as one of the most unique devices in my collection. It's also just plain fun to play around with.What makes the Portal special? For one, the raw oomph. As of August 2023, this is top tier among Android handhelds that are suitable for emulation. (Some newer phones will outperform the Portal, but most of these have aspect ratios that are less than ideal for emulating older consoles.) Of course there are new consoles released seemingly every week, and the Portal will surely be surpassed in power sooner rather than later.That's OK, because power isn't all the Portal has going for it. It's a handheld that, despite the unmistakeable influence of the Nintendo Switch, manages to feel inspired in its own right. Other handhelds have done detachable controllers, but Pimax's magnetic holsters are a neat take on the concept; it's remarkable how satisfying it is to hear the click as the magnets snap the controllers back into place A 4K screen is overkill for emulating retro games but is darn pleasant to have around for general Android usage. There's also a micro-HDMI *in* port on the QLED version enabling the Portal to be used as a tiny external monitor, should you be inclined in that direction. Most importantly ... in just another couple of months, Pimax will be releasing a VR headset that allows you to turn the Portal into an Oculus Quest competitor. It's a brilliantly versatile device.That said, the Portal isn't perfect. The build of Android 10 it ships with is a little too locked down for my tastes. Things have gotten better as of a week or so ago; Pimax now lets users set a custom launcher. But there are still some peculiarities. For example, the familiar notification area Android users expect when swiping from the top of the screen is nowhere to be found. This means it's impossible to check on the status of your downloads in Firefox, for example. Hopefully these quirks get ironed out over the coming months.Despite these niggles, I have no qualms recommending the Portal to people who can afford the (admittedly) luxury price tag. It's an amazing tech toy.",

Problems with read/write speed on SD card after update. Which could be improved in the future.Overall, I would really love this thing to succeed, but I don't see a way considering the stage of the product and that it's already selling for this price",

They keep posting a picture of a white console having led glowrings around joysticks but in fact, only the most expensive black QLED version has these. All other lower cost version DO NOT have glowing joysticks!Pimax refuses to update the Android version, and never made the extra buttons on top of joysticks functional.The ergonomics of the console are terrible. My thumbs hurt when I play. Joysticks are very imprecise, very hard to make fine movements.",

I play emulator games and literally have stopped using my Nintendo Switch. I definitely recommend it for a handheld and will update my review when VR mode is finally available.Battery life may need some optimization and I get about two hours of life. TheThe QLED screen is crisp and clear.The controllers are definitely fun and it's pretty comfortable minus the the tear drop buttons which are kind of sharp.It's weight is really nice and not noticeable.This thing does heat up pretty decently but does not burn me.",
