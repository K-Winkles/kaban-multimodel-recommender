Step away from social media for a bit with this addictive game! I love that you can control how loud the game is INCLUDING a mute option (which is what I play on most of the time or very low.) Super portable. The little astronaut at the top is too cute and is perfect to go along with any space theme. I also think that it is super fun that there are four different game modes that you can play on! Easy little stocking stuffer or just as a cute small gift. This game takes batteries but it comes with batteries when you buy it so that is really thoughtful and nice!",

I have seen it all over social media and it is definitely worth the hype. My 5 and 8 year old enjoy playing with it and it keeps them occupied. It\u2019s so easy to play even my 3.5 year old can play it.",
