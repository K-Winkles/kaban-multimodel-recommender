                "reviewText": "So these are the things that are probably most important to people in regards to this cool mini PS2 retro emulator first of all you do not need the internet to set it up or to use it as a matter of fact it does not have a ethernet or Wi-Fi module it comes with a preloaded 65 gig SD card that does have over 5,000 games on it of course there are some duplicates only because it will provide Sonic for example for multiple platforms. I literally took it out of the box plugged in the power by which you will need a USB adapter it does not come with one no big deal we all have those things laying around. The length of the cord on the controllers is over 6 ft which is awesome along with the HDMI and power cables. The controllers look and feel exactly like PS2 controllers I played and tried probably about 40 games and they all worked without a hitch. The availability to be able to save your games and progress is awesome and an addition to create a favorites list along with a history I also tried to search function and it worked flawlessly when you want to search for a certain title. the thing looks really cool because it looks just like a little PlayStation 2 which I love. I am planning on giving this as a gift to my 10 year old nephew for Christmas. I took the item out of the package to make sure that it works and to set it all up but it does not need to be set up all you have to do is plug it in hook it up and it's ready to go literally. I think it's really freaking cool and in addition it outputs at 720P.",
