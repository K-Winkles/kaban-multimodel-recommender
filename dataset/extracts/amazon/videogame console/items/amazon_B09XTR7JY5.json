Came with a nice carrying case with enough space for some earbuds or anything little thing you want to store with the small net.Immediately replaced the micro sd card with a Teamgroup 128gb one. Installed Onion OS and this little device is so compelling to use. Great functionality and a sleep mode that isn't as perfect as a Nintendo Switch, but it only takes 5-10 seconds to boot back into your game.The ergonomics aren't ideal for long playing sessions. You'll have to find your optimal position to hold your device. Can even game one handed for RPG's.Plays all the way up to PS1 games, some are great for the screen, other text heavy games can be harder to get used to. GBA has perfect emulation, although the fast forward isn't as great (More like 1.5x - 2x speed).Look up Tiny Best Set: Go! for more setups for beginners.I take my Miyoo on long car rides and anytime I know I'm gonna be somewhere with a couple minutes to kill. So pocketable and portable. Great little device and can't wait for the next iterations. (I'm looking at you Miyoo Mini Flip)",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ll get the 1 minor gripe out the way first. I spent several hours going through this unbelievable list of games and marking favorites. As of last night I had 299. As I checked to write this review this morning, I only had 1 in my favorites list (see picture). I clearly have more than that in my recent review list. The con in that is, though all my favorites are marked, you can\u2019t go to 1 section as intended to access them. That\u2019s where this massive list turns into a con because finding the game you want to play can take some time. Small gripe because\u2026THIS IS A DREAM COME TRUE!! I\u2019ve been gaming for 36 yrs now and almost ALL of my favorites are in one well packaged little case. The size for me is perfect for what it is! The display is beautiful for every game from Super Mario Bros. NES, MK on the Genesis, and even arcade favorites like Shadow Warriors and Marvel vs Capcom! It even comes with a screen protector and cleaning kit. The sound is very accurate! Ryu\u2019s classic \u201cHadoken!\u201d and \u201cShoryuken!\u201d shouts from Street Fighter II triggers so many great memories playing in the arcade as a kid. And there\u2019s so many more games to explore from consoles I couldn\u2019t possibly afford as a kid like the neo geo and games I didn\u2019t know existed. Worth the money. The minor gripe is a small inconvenience in comparison to this over awesome deal. It also comes with a solid travel case to protect it custom made that does not feel cheap in anyway. I\u2019d say that alone would be worth $20. Miyoo 4lyfe",

                "reviewText": "Love the device, very cool and works well. The SD card and rom dump is low quality. Buy a brand name high speed SD card right away! If you like the setup back up the SD card it comes with. I found the game list to be lack luster and a handful didn't work. 3rd day I had it the SD card developed an error. It wouldn't play any games and the os load time was over a minute. I had a spare 64gb card so I downloaded and setup the system with a more curated list. It's easy and there are lots of youtube videos to walk you through the process.",
