I was so looking goward to getting this, as I was a big gamer back in the atari 2600 days and this was supposed to have thousands of games on it. Unfortunately it you have to download them somehow. The games that were on there like 6 of them dont even work and the ones that do are so horrible that it is unbelievable. Once i plugged it in it looked promising as i show in the video, but then there is nothing on the memory stick but a few super, super bad games, horrible graphic and gameplay. This sytem is not only bad the buttons on the joystick does not work to well, they dont respond. The price at $59.99 would be great if the system worked well, and the games as well. It is not a good prouduct at all, and wish i never ordered, complete waste.",

When I set it up, I could get about 25 games. The graphics were minimal, and the gameplay was choppy. I am not a gaming expert, but my kids played a lot of games when they were young, so I know a little about what games they had. I did not recognize any of the titles of these games. I found a generic Tetris game, but after playing it one time, I was disappointed. The wireless controllers did work, but most of the buttons were useless.At first, I thought I had missed something when connecting and setting up this system. I sent a message to the seller asking for further instructions. I received a quick response that informed me that there were only a few games. They went on to say \u201cThis is the updated version which we avoid the patent issues,\u201d and insisted that they are \u201chigh quality selected games\u201d and apologized for the wrong product information on the listing. So there was not any help there.I had hoped to have this system set up and available for my grandchildren to play when they visit. I will have to continue to look for something because I will not get any use out of this game system. I do not recommend it to anyone.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m not gonna try to sugar coat this - this is a really lame product. Probably one of the most disappointing experiences I\u2019ve ever had reviewing stuff. It says nine emulators, and it looks to be PlayStation style controllers, plus it costs a pretty significant amount of money, so I had some decent hopes up that this would have some pretty awesome games on there. When it arrived, I excitedly hooked it up, but I immediately had to stop to go to the store to buy AAA batteries (the controllers need 3 batteries each, but they decided not to include them). I got back, installed the batteries, and I selected a category. I was SUPER bummed to realize that not only are there only maybe 20 games on this thing total, roughly 5 per category, but they were 8 bit NES games. And they are absolutely not any of the good ones. THE GAME SELECTIONS ARE SO AWFUL, seriously. They would have been much, much better off not including any games at all and just telling you to figure out how to put your own on there. It seems like they intentionally picked the most comically horrendous games they could find, just to have a laugh. Not even one game worth playing for even a couple of minutes. Not at all exaggerating. There was no reason to even include PlayStation style controllers with this, since all but two of the buttons would never be used. It would have been overpriced even if it were fun, but as it is, it\u2019s completely absurd to think of spending 60 bucks on this. I don\u2019t give one star ratings and scathing reviews often, but I would have given this one 0 stars if it were an option. They gave the lowest effort imaginable with the game selection.",
