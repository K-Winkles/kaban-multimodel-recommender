                "reviewText": "If you are 1980's boy, like me. You will love it and should not miss it: is different than any other single platform ones.1. This open source handheld game console is an all-in-one monster that supports thousands of classic games from all other platforms.2. Its battery is strong enough to play the whole day.3. It runs smoothly on most games including PSP ones. Thanks to its upgraded CPU.4. I like the button touch, esp the slope design of R1/L1 buttons in the back helps you to press them more comfortably. The size and weight are also kids friendly, my kids love it.5. You can definitely play it as a game console on table at home as well. It supports 2.4/5G WIFI, bluetooth, wireless/wired controller connection, HDMI output to TV, vibration motor, WIFI online pairing, streaming etc. Streaming has a little latency, but it is quite normal to such a small device.6. It comes with an internal 64GB micro SD card, you can also add an additional one for extra storage for you downloaded games.7. The screw hole design on the battery lid in the back tributes to the classic. Love it!8. Classic games and the size of this little monster are always a perfect match. You just grab and go. Take it from your pocket and enjoy playing anytime.Anyway I love it so much! It brings me back to my childhood memories.",

To my surprise it can actually play \u201csome\u201d N64, Dreamcast and NDS games. You can also add more games and customize it to your liking with other OS like Onion, Garlic, Batocera or Koriki or others. Not sure why no one has reviewed this even though they sold many already so here\u2019s my 2 cents. Shipping was overnight with prime and was on time. I actually bought a few more for gifts since shipping is so quick.",
