                "reviewText": "I bought this for a anonymous gift program for underprivileged kids that our church was having. The child requested a specific 300 in 1 handheld that was basically full of retro games. That thing wasn't actually being sold at the big box retailer he specified in his request, and that forced me to scramble to find something else. I searched a lot and found some similar to the one he wanted from Wally World. To be honest it was junk and I felt like this kid deserved better than that.Thankfully the box came without shrink and I was able to open it and check this out. I genuinely want one of these for myself now. It is FULL of games, has a high-quality color screen and if you have any tech savvy you can add a 2nd SD card (or update the existing one) with more roms. My understanding is that it can handle titles up to P_S_1.As it stands it has an abundance of nice titles right out of the box. I am 100% confident that I made the right decision to buy this. Compared to the other cheap handhelds this one is amazing.",

While I still think the included battery offers enough power for long gaming sessions, the way the power button works is not ideal. A single press of the power button only turns off the screen, but the rest of the unit remains on. If you plan on not using the device shortly after turning off the screen, you must remember to exit your game, then totally power off the unit with a long press of the power button. If you forget to do this, the until will remain on, draining the battery the entire time until it dies, which will happen in about 24 hours.While some of you might be thinking, DUUUHHH, just turn it off, you clearly don't have children. I suspect many users (adult and kids alike) of this device fail to do this on a regular basis and come back to play some games only to find the device with no power. It would be nice if there was a way to put the unit in a power save mode which allows you to resume the emulator and game you were in, without having to keep exiting the game, powering down the unit, then fully powering the unit back on, going into your emulator, loading your game and resuming where you left off. That the unit has only full on/full off options is not ideal.------------------------Before I begin, I think it is important to know what my experience is with emulators, and the perspective I am coming from when reviewing this product.I've been playing classic video games on emulators since the early 00s on PC and the original \"black and green\" Xbox. I remember excitedly awaiting the newest releases of MAME, SNes9x, and FCEultra to see which new games support was added for. Back then, reliable emulation of consoles like the N64 and original PS was just a pipe dream.The Anbernic RG35XX Plus is a pretty decent handheld emulator that depending on what your level of experience is, and what you expect out of it, may or may not be for you. I do not know who Anbernic is, however this exact device is available on Amazon and other retailers under a variety of names, so I cannot say for sure if the experience is the same with the many similar alternatives out there.Pros:The unit is reasonably well made with buttons that are easy to press and respond well. The four trigger buttons on the back have the most amount of play in them, but are far from what I'd call cheap feeling. They feel comparable to me to any number of 3rd party controllers for the Xbox or Playstation you can buy out there, but clearly aren't as good as the OEM ones.By far, the best thing about this device is the 3.5\" IPS screen. The resolution is 640x480 which could be better, but is good enough for most classic systems. I found it to be bright and crisp and I had no issue with brightness or contrast using the device in my home, midday, with sunlight coming through the windows. I did not try it in direct sunlight, but who plays video games outside in direct sunlight?I also found the battery life to be pretty good. The 3300mAh rechargeable battery has easily lasted me a few days of moderate gaming over the winter holiday break without needing to be recharged. A quick note though is that while playing, a single press of the power button only turns off the screen. Everything else is still on however, draining the battery. When you are done playing for a while, you should long press the power button to actually get it to shut down and conserve the battery.Performance from the quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 CPU is better than I expected. I had no issues with slowdown in any classic consoles like the NES, SNES, Atari, Sega Genesis, and any of the MAME games I tried. I did notice some slowdowns playing PSP games like Forza however, but that seems reasonable considering the power disparity of the two. I remember 20 years ago when it was a challenge to get SNES games to run properly, so this was a nice thing to see.Dual micro SD cards. It is nice to be able to add and swap as much storage to this device if you like. For those of you who like to tinker, you can load different operating systems on this thing, backup, and duplicate memory cards offering near limitless potential. You can even use this thing as a personal media player if you wish.HDMI port and bluetooth connectivity. These are nice options to have. Connecting the device to my TV is kinda neat, other than the fact that I need to pull out a very long HDMI cable to reach the device and the back of my TV, which I am not likely to do often. Being able to connect some bluetooth headphones for quiet gaming is a nice touch too, but I haven't actually tried it yet. If you don't want to use Bluetooth, there is also a standard 1/8\" headphone jack on the bottom.Cons:Despite what the commercials and obviously biased TikTok videos say, this device is not perfect. For starters, the default UI is pretty basic, and likely will confuse people who don't know alot about emulation, especially if you are in the US. For example, most of the consoles go by their Japanese names, like the NES and SNES are called the FC (Famicon) and SFC (Super Famicon), the Sega Genesis is called the MD (Mega Drive). These names aren't wrong, just not what people unfamiliar with emulation or original Japense consoles would recognize. Additional confusion is that there are multiple MAMEs, making finding the game you want difficult.Speaking of games, while I completely understand that it can be difficult to find every game for every person, the default list of ROMs is missing some pretty glaring games such as every single Super Mario Bros game from both the NES and SNES, the Gameboy is missing Tetris, the original game that came with it, MAME is missing any Pacman games or Spy Hunter (my all time favorite), the Atari 2600 is missing Missile Command.Yes, you can add these games yourself if you have the ROMs, but this isn't something the average novice is going to be able to do. If the company who built this thing and packaged these ROMs together (whether legally or not) wanted it to be the ULTIMATE handheld emulator, essential classics like these should be included.There are two methods for emulation, through something called the Game Room or RA Game (which is actually called RetroArch). Some reviews mention that RA is less stable which I have not observed, however I believe the experience is better through RA as it does not attempt to stretch the resolution of the original game to match the device's native 640x480 resolution which causes really bad artifacts and blurring in some games. Using the RA emulation, although the screen is smaller, the picture quality is much better.Finally, the overall shape and size are not ideal. I found the B/A/X/Y buttons to be too close together. There is room on this unit to space them apart farther without increasing the overall size of the unit, however during heavy game play, with average sized male hands, I find myself hitting the wrong button far too often. If your muscle memory is used to an actual video game controller, you will struggle with these. In addition the location of the four rear buttons are not ideal and cause hand cramps on games that use them, which thankfully aren't any of the games I play, but in a test session playing PSP games, my hands cramped up very quickly using the back buttons.Overall:I could probably come up with a few more gripes, but I have to take into account the price of this thing. For around $80, you get a capable, but flawed, hand held emulator with a terrific screen and enough power to play most classic games. I think the size is too small for anything more than the simplest of games, but at least there are other, larger options out there. The included software is the worst part of this device as it was clearly put together with very little effort.I think that with a much improved user interface, the experience could be better, but ultimately, the device is too small for serious gaming. If you are experienced with emulating and changing operating systems, and you have small hands, this might be the perfect device for you. If however, you are a casual gamer and just want to experience some retro nostalgia from the 80s and 90s, you will likely be disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "From cheaply fabricated, to entirely buggy, the anbernic is a mess. I returned the first device after it refused to turn on (after charging, and trouble shooting for hours with the micro sd card as well) and prayed the second would work better. How wrong I was. Fine for a use or two of an hour out of the box before it stopped working as well. Incredibly disappointed in this product. Do not waste your money or time.",
