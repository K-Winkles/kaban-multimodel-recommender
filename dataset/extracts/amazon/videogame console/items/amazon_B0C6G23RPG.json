I figured this was a safe alternative to give him something as his own. That would hopefully have some of the same types of games. It is a nice little handheld game set. Perfect for a small child but saying that there's 500 games is incredibly misleading. There are several games that are repeated multiple times and a lot of the games are ones that I have never even heard of. However, it does have a few classics such as Mario and donkey Kong. I wish that the description had given a better idea of what games were included just so that I knew what to expect seeing Mario. I got excited and was hoping to see he some of the legend of Zelda games, even if only the older ones because he loves those. However, it doesn't seem like this is specific to Nintendo or any other specific gaming system. It just has random games.",

From nostalgic favorites to exciting challenges, there's something for everyone.The 3.2-inch screen provides a crisp and vibrant display, making the gaming experience enjoyable for both kids and adults. The built-in battery is a lifesaver \u2013 no need to worry about constantly replacing batteries. It lasts surprisingly long on a single charge.One of the highlights for me is the 2-player controller feature. Connecting it to the TV for multiplayer gaming brings back memories of the good old days, huddled around the screen with friends and family.",

                "reviewText": "This is a pretty cool little system. I love the selection of games - far more than I'll ever be able to play! One of my favorites of course is Super Mario and though it looks great, the game play is slightly off.The original NES only had an A and B button, and this has four buttons - labelled A, B, X, and Y. When playing Super Mario on this system, both A and B function as jump buttons, but only A works the same as it did on NES, allowing both a short and high jump. If you push the B button on this system, you can only do a short jump, not the long jump, which is pretty important with Super Mario. I don't understand why A and B both allow you to jump, but don't function the same.I also used to love Contra and found that it plays well, but I did try the classic cheat code (up-up-down-down-left-right-left-right-B-A-start) to get 30 extra lives and it didn't work. Contra is extremely difficult to beat without that cheat code.The other issue I had is that my controller doesn't work. I got this connected to my TV, but can't get the extra controller to do anything, which means I have to be within about 8 feet of my TV to use this on the big screen, which is too close for me to sit on the couch and play.Overall, the system is good, but there are a few flaws with it. I'd recommend it to those who plan to use it only as a handheld system and not hooked up to a TV.",
