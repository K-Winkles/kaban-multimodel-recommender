It has all the great games you use to play as a kid back in the 70\u2019s-early 2000\u2019s BUT\u2026With his parents permission, I bought this for my 5 year old nephew as a gift so he could learn the games and type of consoles we use to play when we were his age and so he could appreciate his whenever his parents decide to give him the expensive stuff. Told him he has to prove he can take care of his stuff so he can get the nice expensive stuff. Well with that said that dog gone console didn\u2019t last him 3 days and not of his own doing. He was so upset he thought he did something wrong. \ud83d\ude10 I expected the thing not to last very long because let\u2019s face it, you get what you pay for; but I wasn\u2019t expecting it to last 3 days.When I tested it, it worked fine. The first day he played it we noticed a lot of the games were repetitive, different names but the same game and with glitches. So you\u2019d have to find the games without the glitches. The longer he played it he said it started glitching the screen too and then just stopped working. You could hear the game playing but the screen didn\u2019t work. He was on it about 2 hours the first day. The 2nd day about the same but with slight glitches and the third about 45 minutes before it completely gave out. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t return it either because I bought it a month before I gave it to him. They\u2019re from out of state. \ud83d\ude10",
