                "reviewText": "I really want to love this little handheld. I put a little over 20 hours of Pokemon Fire Red on this thing and was an overall great experience. There are some quality control issues that can easily be looked over, for example, the start button sticks and is extremely annoying. I went to grab it today after charging it for a few hours the night prior, and it died almost within 5 minutes of use. After plugging in several USB c cords, they all indicated no charging in progress. I have initiated an Amazon return, but I'll leave it charging overnight to see if I can get anywhere. I'm a little frustrated with the progress I've lost.Edit: it appears there is an issue with the current firmware revision that depletes the battery while in standby. I was able to get the device to work after letting it charge overnight. There still appears to be an issue with WiFi connectivity and longer passwords. I've tried updating the firmware to the latest official Anbernic image, but WiFi and standby battery are still an issue. I have since purchased an RG405V and also have an RG35xxh on the way.Overall, this device is a promising little handheld and meets many of my requirements but standby and WiFi issues can be extremely frustrating. I'd say wait and see what official updates are released by Anbernic. The RG35xx appears to have a ton of third-party support and custom firmware, so I imagine the RG35XX plus should receive some of the same support with time.",

                "reviewText": "I have tested a few emulation devices from Amazon and was always left disappointed and quite frankly, lied to. However, this breaks that mold.This is a true emulation device with thousands of old and known video games. However, this is more of the base model when it comes to Anbernic devices so, with this specific model, RG35XX Plus, you will not have all video games pre-loaded. For example, this device has zero N64 games.I\u2019ve tested about 5 games from this device for several hours and this is what I observed. Picture quality is excellent, vibrant; however, I did run into a few stutters. Sound is good for its\u2019 little speaker, but it also has a 3.5mm jack for headphones (which I used and it worked good). Comfort leaves a lot to be desired. It is a small unit and after an hour or so, my fingers and joints were hurting from being in a cramped position. Battery life is really dependent on the games chosen to play. For example, an NES game will play a lot longer than a PS1 game. This device does have a suspend feature (similar to the Steam Deck) where you can instantly pause game. You can also save any game file.Price is a little high (about $86 at time of review) compared to some Social Media sites that also sell the Anbernic devices. Overall, this is a true emulation device and I think it\u2019s worth the price if you enjoy retro gaming. Four out of Five stars only due to the fact I cannot play the device comfortably for long, otherwise, it would be a five star product.",
