        "description": "The Nintendo Wii is a family-friendly video game console that is not only entertaining but also interactive as well. With motion-control technology, the gamer can truly interact with the game on a personal level, rather than participating as a passive player. A pioneer in interactive gaming, Nintendo has enabled its video games to be more lifelike and cooperative. All new Nintendo Wii consoles come with one Wii Remote Plus controller, one Nunchuk controller for specific gaming, and a Wii Sensor bar. Up to four Wii Remote Plus controllers can be connected at once using built-in wireless technology powered by Bluetooth.. The Wii controller has a sensor on it that enables the user to select menu preferences, scroll through screens, and activate the game itself. Purchasing a Wii-enabled yoga mat or Wii Fit balance board further elevates the gaming experience. With the ability to exercise, dance, and meditate, exercise-oriented video games transform the home into a gym. *DLC (Downloadable Content) may not be included and is not guaranteed to work*",

If you need a Wii review, this isn't for you.Now, the box was very generic, and shipped inside another box. The contents were all wrapped in plastic and had cellophane or similar that peeled off. I wasn't expecting the nun-chuk controllers or the nonslip grips that cover the normal controllers, but they were there. Nor was I expecting the rechargeable batteries. Maybe that was in the description and I missed it. Anyway, like-new condition, nothing installed, works just fine. Needed to get this and a balance board for back, core, and balance issues. Happy to have it.",

After 45 minutes with tech support, I need to return the item to the seller. I wanted to be positive and purchase refurbished to help with the environment and waste, but it was a complete let down.This didn\u2019t even get past step one! How do you sell a project that doesn\u2019t even sync on the FIRST step? So disappointing.",

                "reviewText": "So far the system seems to work fine. I wish the instructions were more in depth in how it works and the set up process. My biggest obstacle was trying to figure out how to use the remote when you first get things started. You have to sync it, which is on the instruction paper, but what it doesn't tell you is that you need the motion bar plugged in and in a good place in order to use the remote. I had a Wii when they first came out and didn't remember if the bar was required. Maybe its not, but it certainly made life easier. Once you get that figured out you just have to follow the prompts on the tv. I will need to get an AV to HDMI converter in order for me to use it on my living room tv, but luckily I had an old tv from about 10 years ago that still had the AV ports. My only other complaint so far is that it didn't come with the remote grips. It came with the straps, but not the actual grips.",

Upon unboxing it was apparent that the item was not in \u201cLike New\u201d or even \u201cGood\u201d condition. It looked as if someone had pulled it out of their basement after sitting for 10 years. It was dirty, the remotes yellowing and scratched, one missing a lens. They were sticky and the buttons were crunchy. It did include a rechargeable battery pack and stand which was as advertised, and the only item \u201cLike New\u201d. I essentially had to refurbish the other items myself. There were carpet beetle larvae husks in the disk slot and the ports were covered in grime and dirt. The nunchucks were in \u201cModerate\u201d condition, also seemingly untouched from storage.It turns on and for the first 6-10 hours of use has seemingly no issues internally. However, after the 3rd week of light use, it began having issues reading disks when first put in the console and has began crashing once booted up and in game.I know they source these products through different \u201crefurbishment\u201d companies so your order result may vary, but it was not a good experience and felt like an all around scam.",
