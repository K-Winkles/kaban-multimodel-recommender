                "reviewText": "I purchased 2 of those games for my 8 and 13 year old grandsons. I was nervous because I really don't know anything about these games except that there are over 300 retro games on them. They were CRAZY ABOUT THEM, and they didn't want to put them down. The price was excellent too.",

                "reviewText": "Don't get me wrong, this is a really, really neat concept, but it feels as though the manufacturer didn't quite put the live in they could've.For one, some of the games feel a bit glitchy, or maybe they were always glitchy and should have been fixed/\"remastered\"/refurbished for this device. Sometimes the controls feel a little funky, as if the original game was meant to use different controls.There are also some repeat games on here. It says \"365 in one\" on the screen and packaging but it's actually more like the \"350 in one\", if even. I've included photos showing some of the repeats, which appear to be the same sections of games just \"copy/pasted\" in twice. You'll notice the numbers are different though. Now to be fair, some of these games are pretty interesting and it offers an sort of window into the past- I was never in to arcade games myself, so some of these are pretty new experiences. But I wouldn't say any of these games are good enough to be included twice. ;)I've put maybe a few hours at most on it so far and it seems that the screen is already starting to go dark. Not sure if that's because I had it on one page for some time as I was taking pictures of the screen or if it means the batteries are already wearing out. There is a Micro USB (not to be confused with USB-C) port on top through which you can plug the device into the wall directly (I haven't tried plugging it into a power bank but I wouldn't be surprised if that worked as well), so that's nice, but it shouldn;t eb going through power so quickly.Part of the issue may be that the sound cannot be turned off. You can turn it down so low you can barely hear it, but you can still hear the sounds as quiet fuzzy noise. It never clicks completely off. There is also no way to manually control the brightness of the screen.I got this for the nostalgia it represents, and don't get me wrong, this is a pretty cool idea, but if I'm being honest the original big grey Game Boy was a superior design from a functionality standpoint, even if it was just a dot matrix without color. :)Thanks!",
