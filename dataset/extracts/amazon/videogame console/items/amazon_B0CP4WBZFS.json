Dust or a wonky fit might be mucking up the HDMI port on your display. Try giving it a clean before another go. 2. The memory card might not be seated right due to jostling during transit. Pull it out, pop it back in, then power up the device. 3. If the indicator light on the device isn't coming on, it could be because it's getting too much power, which might lead to burnout.",
