The picture isn't super clear like what we're used to these days but it's like it was back in the day and it doesn't bother me at all, my daughter loves it and it's so much fun spending time with her playing these games and teaching her all about paper boy and Mario and Tetris.",

                "reviewText": "This console is a nice idea, although it requires a HDMI adapter in order to hook up to most new TVs. However, the mini usb power adapter and adapter port are junk, so the unit continually loses power because the port is so loose. I will try my luck with a replacement if the seller can exchange",
