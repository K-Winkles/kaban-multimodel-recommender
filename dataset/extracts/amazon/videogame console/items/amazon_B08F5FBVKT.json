                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This PSP clone is a decent portable gaming system It can easily play game Boy, Gameboy color, Gameboy Advance, Nintendo, Super Nintendo, and Sega Genesis. It does have a hard time playing PlayStation or higher games due to hardware struggles. Overall I would recommend this! The menu is easy to navigate, the games are easy to load onto the system, everything is built generally good. I would complain about the d-pad though. There are only four directional buttons, which for games like Mortal Kombat with special moves back down forward is nearly impossible to do. It feels awkward in games like MK and Street Fighter, but the joystick comes in handy only in those times. I would use the joystick in the menu mainly. Again for $30 for a portable game system with a decent screen and sound that plays all the classic 8-bit and 16-but games, why not. Oh and it loads fine without the SD card in it. Turn the system on then put in the SD card it works fine otherwise it won't boot. Happy gaming!",

Battery doesn't last but 5mins after first charge, the buttons layouts are not as described (Button A has the B functions), the equipment in itself weights just as much if not lighter than a solar calculator (this should tell you the quality of what you're getting; except a solar calculator is worth 4.99$), the list goes on. Go find something else that it's l9ng lasting and much attention calling to your little one or for yourself. This will just be a waste a money that will last you no more than a week. Not to mention, you can't play games while charging it as it will shut off on you but battery will not hold the charge.",
