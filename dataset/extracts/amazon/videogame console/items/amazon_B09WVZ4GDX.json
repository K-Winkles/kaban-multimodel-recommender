All I could do was start games and exit them.Also, the retro games are in a long list that you can only scroll line by line. If you wanted to play a game toward the end of the alphabet it would take 10 minutes to scroll to it.",

So whenmy friends come over with their young children they can have fun & maybe the adults will join their kids in some family competition. I also brought another one for our Church's Wednesday Night Live Event where we play a variety of games but I'm in charge of keeping the preteens engaged. This Game Console, with it's wide variety of motion games, keep them happy & laughing. I join in too. The $60 price tag, easy to setup, and the almost endless number of games make this purchase a no brainer.",
