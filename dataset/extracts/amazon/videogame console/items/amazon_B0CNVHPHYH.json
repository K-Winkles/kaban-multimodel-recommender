                "reviewText": "What I hate most about this game is that you have to hit the reset button in order to replay the same game. If I'm playing Tetris and lose the game, I have to hit the reset button which takes you to the game control's intro, find the game again if I want to replay. What bothers me the most about this game is that it contains multiple versions of the same game! Even though it mentions more than 160 games, does this really matter if there are 10 variations of Pacman, 10, variations of Donkey Kong, 10 versions of Mario brothers, etc.? And games that aren't exactly one of these games are then weak 'variations' of these games, just with another name. When I reached out to the manufacturers, they blew me off. I will look to find a better game.",
