Which is fine, I got it to put in my closet under my hanging clothes and this was one of the better options based on measurements. Once it was put together I let it air out for a day before I put anything in it, my husband said it smelled funny but I didn\u2019t really notice any strong odors from it.The fabric drawers are sturdy, the handles are screwed in so they\u2019re also pretty sturdy. The drawer bottoms have an insert so I think they\u2019ll be sturdy and hold up over time, but we shall see.It was very easy to assemble. The instructions are easier to follow than most IKEA items. I was not missing any pieces or parts and there was an \u201cextra screw\u201d packet in with my stuff so that was helpful.Overall\u2026. this was a cheap purchase for a quick solution to a problem and I\u2019m happy with my purchase.

In actuality this item is a joke especially for what I paid for it. There is absolutely no scenario when this \u201cdresser\u201d could be a useful item. DO NOT BUY THIS.

However, it is the correct size, I just didn\u2019t expect it to be so small. The drawers are great and deep as described. I love the look and that it is so lightweight, making it easy to move to wherever I need it. Easy to clean and looks great.",

The stand came quickly, it was in great condition, all the parts were there, no rips or damage. I had read some reviews on putting it together could take some time so was even more pleasantly surprised that doing it alone only took me 45 minutes and only because I put in one of the braces backwards. It not only is sturdy but looks great.",

I have purchased 6 so far and as my funds permit, I will replace ALL of my heavy, wooden, dressers, end tables, sofa tables and office cabinets/file cabinets with these. I\u2019m getting up in the years, live alone and have no one to help me move heavy furniture. These are SO EASY to assemble and lightweight enough to move. The drawers are so big and can hold so much of whatever it is you want to store. For my master bedroom, I bought all white so I can paint and decorate them to fit my bedroom scheme. I could NOT be happier.",
