                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Came boxed in a sturdy cardboard box, not the flimsy recycled material. Each piece was packed in a protective surrounding and nothing was scratched damaged or missing. The top and bag holder fit like gloves.The base is aluminum and color painted. The color is true Burgundy and looks as depicted. The top matches in color even though it is ABS plastic. Sensor works great as you can see in video. You can put a lot in this 3 gal container surprisingly. The rectangular shape allows a nice fit by my bed. One minor annoyance the sensor is sensitive so if your covers flop over the sensor it activates. You can shut off the device with the power button to prevent this if you wish. Also if you want to keep it open for a period of time this can also be accomplished in the same way.If your looking for a well designed and sturdy product this it. Don\u2019t hesitate to buy it or any of the larger sizes. If you have a need to replace a part they have a catalog of parts on line including battery doors.I bought this because of my dog digging in the open basket and having lunch with everything in it or worse shredding it all over the floor. Several test and he can\u2019t get into the container, success! Well almost the battery door popped off somehow and he ate it. Now I have to buy another battery door Not even 24 hrs after receiving it. How disappointing!",

The motion sensor works just well every time. Although it does not tap anywhere to open, but waving the knee or hand a foot above works perfectly. And the 3-gallon unit is surprisingly enough for my small bedroom needs. The teal blue color is nice. Nobody paid me to write this review.",

I think it looks really nice since it has a cover so you don\u2019t see open trash. It seems to hold quite a bit of trash too and has an open and close button on it.",

                "reviewText": "I should have paid more attention to the poor ratings. Basically the pattern is, a lot of great ratings from customers who love it for the first few weeks as it performs well. But then as time pushes on, the return window has since closed, the trash can stops performing for a host of reasons. The common thread is the lid stops working or starts over-working. In my case, I fall in with the group whose lid just won't open anymore. I thought it was a simple case of the batteries needed replacing. I replaced them, thought maybe I had put in a dead batch. Decided to use the reusable batteries we have, charged them up, put them in, the lid performed better with the regular batteries with only a little juice left. It just doesn't work now. Now I'm hearing that the customer service is bad and that the troubleshooting tips given are ineffective and I just don't have the energy to go through all that. Not for no trash can. I'm just gonna take the L on this one. Will probably just dump the lid and use it like a regular (albeit over-priced) trash can.",

                "reviewText": "When my 3 year old asked for a rainbow theme bathroom I naturally purchased a rainbow garbage can. Unfortunately, it made a nice orange rust ring on my new white tile floor and it had to go. So I asked him again, \u201cwhat kind of garbage do you want in your rainbow bathroom?\u201d His response, \u201cA yellow one with an automatic door.\u201d For those who don\u2019t know my son his favorite color is yellow and he has an obsession with anything automatic or motion censored. When I saw this garbage can I thought, \u201cWow did someone make this just for him?\u201d Well it arrived and now I am obsessed. It was so easy to assemble (some batteries, put a little tall bag in it and place the black frame and lid on top). You waved over the censor it opens. And then after a few seconds, just closes itself. It\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s perfect for diapers too because you just wave your hand and you don\u2019t have to touch anything. The lid helps seal any rancid odors. And the best part is that it occupies my toddler on a daily basis. The day we opened it he played with it for 2 hours in the living room. In fact, I may just put one on his Christmas list for pure entertainment value. It\u2019s a great technology! It is a pretty small size though so you have to change the bag every day or so. In fact I\u2019m going to see if they make it in larger sizes right now because that\u2019s his much I love it.",
