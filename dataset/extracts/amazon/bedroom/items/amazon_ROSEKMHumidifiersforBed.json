Could I put the humidifier on the floor or a wooden table? Yes, but it isn\u2019t the smartest move: 1. Best place to put a humidifier is where the most airflow is. 2. Potential of wetting the surroundings due to locally high humidity levels, it is recommended to put a tray underneath it. Is the bubbling/knocking sound it makes while running normally? It is normal for the humidifier to have bubbling sounds sometimes. It is the sound of water moving from the water tank to the base. Other times it is quiet and does not affect its performance. Can I use tap water or is distilled water preferred? It depends on where you live. In some areas, water is richer in minerals. The humidifier won\u2019t instantly go haywire if you do use tap water, but in the long term will cause scale and you need to maintain it more often. Distilled water is recommended. Is it normal to have standing water in the base when you refill the water reservoir? Yes, it's normal. The water flowing from the tank to the base when you add water and place it back is part of the humidifier's operation. It draws water from the tank and disperses it through the base to increase room humidity.",

                "reviewText": "I got this to deal with dry air while I sleep. It works quite well, very quiet and can dump quite a bit of moisture. To function it needs a hard base that won't obstruct air intake. The nozzle on top can be rotated to aim in a particular direction, but you're warned not to place the unit on wood or aimed at a surface that won't tolerate steam. I placed on my bathroom counter. Downside? While it can be aimed somewhat, and you have four levels of output volume, there is no set point for humidity - I wish it had that feature, but the price point likely rules our having a sensor and attendant control display.",

Winter requires heat which just sucks the humidity out, causing dry skin, coughs etc. These are easy to fill and use, and work well.Minor gripe... the light doesn't stay on when in use, which I would like. Also I would love real buttons instead of the \"touch one, two three, four\" touch button, but hey for the price I can live with it.",

Tried it on the third and it lasted about 8 hours. I\u2019m amazed how spacious it is yet how effective. I will be purchasing another one for the lower level of our house. 10/10",
