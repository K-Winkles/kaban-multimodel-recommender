            "INTEGRATED PROJECTOR WITH A SHARP AND CLEAR IMAGE -- The arm of this digital clock swivels 180 degrees for optimum positioning, getting the fine and smooth time figure image on the wall or ceiling at the appropriate distance of 1.64-11.4ft(0.5-3m). The edges of the projected numerals are surprisingly sharp and clear without having to fiddle with a focus adjustment offered on some other projection clocks.",
            "LARGE LED DISPLAY & 3 BRIGHTNESS LEVELS -- The curved screen with 3.4*1.7inch large digits is easy to read in the dark, even when you are not quite awake or without your glasses. With 3 adjustable levels, you can dial down it to a level that is readable in the daytime but unobtrusive at night. It allows you to separately adjust the brightness of the face display and the projection display.",
            "CHARGE USB PORT AND MICRO USB CABLE -- This digital alarm clock includes a 5V/1A USB output interface that will allow you to still charge your phone or other mobile devices while the clock occupies an outlet, very good for phone battery health.",
            "ALARM WITH PROGRESSIVE BUZZER VOLUME -- This particular clock for bedroom comes with a progressive buzzer volume(75dB), the sound will get louder and faster, which is friendly for heavy sleepers who won't get used to the sudden loud sound. And pressing the big SNOOZE button at the top, you can get extra precious 9 minutes of sleep till the next loop of this alarm.",
            "BIG BUTTONS & EASY TO USE -- This digital clock has large control buttons which are conveniently lined up along the top of the case and are clearly marked with easily understood icons. Therefore, it is easier to reach and use without changing all the other settings. Friendly to operate for kids, seniors or the elder.",
            "BUILT-IN BACKUP BATTERY -- The package contains an AC adapter(AC100-240V,50/60Hz) to power the digital clock. When the power is off unexpectedly, the button cell battery(CR2032) built into the bedside clock can automatically save time & alarm settings (the time is not displayed and the alarm won't go off), no need to reset it again when the power is on.",
            "STYLISH AND UNIQUE CURVED DESIGN -- A curved screen mimics your eyes\u2019 curvature for a more comfortable viewing experience and also can improve your health, too. Research Gate reports that a Harvard Medical School study found curved screens are better at reducing eyestrain and blurred vision and improving focus compared to regular screens.",
            "A GIFT FOR ANY OCCASION -- This digital clock is a great choice to show your care, and an unusual idea to surprise. A perfect gift for everyone, no matter for old or young, men or women, boy or girl. Also suitable for any festival like birthdays, Christmas, New Year's Day, Thanksgiving Day, Valentine\u2019s Day, Father's Day, Mother's Day, etc."

No more turning on a light to see the time or just laying their twisting in bed to see the time on a headboard or bedside alarm clock. The level of brightness does not distract you from sleeping. The numerals are large and easy to read. We are retired so have not used the alarm a lot, but is available and functional I'd you need it.",

I kept craning my neck in bed trying to look at the clock on my headboard, so I wanted a clock that would project on the ceiling or wall. I installed it on the headboard and pointed it towards the opposite wall, a distance of about 14 feet. The size of the numbers at that distance is about 1 ft high so they're easy to see. It has 3 settings for brightness: Off, Low, High. So if you don't want the display on the wall you can easily turn that off. The only problem I have is when the sun comes up and the room starts getting bright, then it's hard to see the numbers. But I can just raise my hand up to use it as a display surface, and voila, the numbers can be seen on my hand. You really can't beat this clock for the features and price,",

Everything about the clock is pretty good and it has lots of options for making it brighter or dimmer and we like that we could get it blue instead of red. But we were so confused that the projection on the ceiling was upside down, so I came back to this page to see if other people left a review to say the same thing. One of them said you need to hold down the projection display button to flip the image. That worked and now we are much happier with it overall. \ud83d\ude05",

You can dim to different levels. During the daylight you can't see the projection. Only at night in the dark. Its pretty cool. My husband says we are in the future lol",
