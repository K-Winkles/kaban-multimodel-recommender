                "reviewText": "I was a bit skeptical about these new type laundry baskets, the way they are made but it only took a minute to put together and I was pleasantly surprised at how well it works for just me in my bedroom. It is big enough to hold enough dirty clothes until I have enough for a whole wash load. I rent a room so I basically live out of my bedroom so you can imagine how packed things can get so I am very happy that this takes up very little room. With the way it is designed, it can be collapsed in just a minute or two and take up very little room if you are thinking of using it for travel. I got it to replace a larger hamper that was just too big and bulky causing me to not have any floor space in my bedroom so I am extremely pleased that I decided to get this. Now I can get rid of my old bulky one, thank goodness. It is not really heavy duty but if used properly with care I see no reason that it shouldn't last a good while. If you are looking for something heavy duty then you need to go with a plastic one but as far as my needs, this is just fine.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This laundry basket is large and sturdy plus easy to assemble. I was looking for a laundry basket that can hold a lot of laundry and has a lid to cover the laundry until wash day. My other laundry kept me washing clothes every day because I did not want the bathroom to look messy and cluttered with loads of items that needed to be washed. Plus, it did not have a lid on it to cover up the mess . This laundry basket is very aesthetically pleasing to the eye, and it hides your dirty laundry until wash day with the lid that is connected to the basket and a bamboo rid that keeps it sturdy. It is very large and deep and looks like it hold about 3 to 4 loads. It also has a bag that\u2019s removable with handles in an adjustable strain so that you can close the laundry bag and move it whenever you please without moving the entire basket but if you choose to move the whole basket, it has handles so you may move as you please. It took every bit of five minutes to assemble this basket and slide it into place in the bathroom.",

The little bag inside it comes off easily and can be placed back into it and is secure with buttons. The lid is a blessing. When you have guests coming to your room (for some reason) you don't have to worry about your old socks or your floppy bra showing in the bag. The bag being black also protects your privacy if you have to go to a laundry room. It is not an eye-sore for the corner of your room either. It looks rigid and nice. if you doubting to get it, just get it.",

That is, unless you are intending to put the washing machine on every day.I particularly like the removable drawstring lining bag that fits inside the hamper and is held in place by four tiny toggles similar to duffle coat buttons. I also like the bamboo rim that acts as sturdy flat base for the lid to sit on and doubles as carrying handles for safely moving the hamper up and down stairs if needed. Alternatively, you could leave the hamper where it is and just remove and refit the lining bag, as and when required.",
