                "reviewText": "The storage bags arrived very quickly and were packaged well. For the price, I like that it's 3 individual units that can be used for different categories of clothing (in my case). Love Love Love the color! It's perfect! Not too light, not too dark, not too bright/juvenile. A nice calming color. It blends well with any decor; which I think is valuable if someone is using the storage outside of a closet or bed, and it has to be seen (ex. Children playroom for toys).The bags seem sturdy, but not bulky. This allows for ample room for stuffing the storage with actual stuff. I really enjoy the number of handles and its placement. It provides diversity & easy access to have handles both horizontally & vertically across each unit.My only concern are the zippers. I hope they're sturdy enough for longterm use. They seem a bit flimsy; so I'm gentle. I would like them a little heavier/stronger; but only time will tell.Overall, I like the product. Just will have to see how it holds up to decipher its longterm value.",

                "reviewText": "When the package arrived, I almost shipped it back without even opening it. I ordered a set of THREE under bed storage boxes that were supposed to be pretty big. There's no way they fit in that tiny package, even all folded up! I was wrong. They fit. And they did so because they are not made out of a thick, strong material I expected, but instead out of thin fabric like what reusable shopping bags are made from. The quality is a step above dollar tree and they hold a lot more stuff than I thought they would after I had initially unfolded them, but I'm not thrilled with the price point compared to the quality. I like the see through side so I can see what's in the \"boxes\" without opening them. I HATE that they are literally flimsy fabric boxes that do not really hold a rectangular shape well. They do the job for storing my kids' out of season clothes, so I will keep them, but if I were on the hunt, i'd look for a sturdier, higher quality set or a set like this at a lower price point.",

I was afraid that the clean smell would be gone by the time I got to wear my sweaters, but when I pulled them out they smell like they had just been washed.",
