And there was a TINY build up of ice after a few weeks of use. Not enough to do anything about and was actually good assurance that it was cold. Money well spent!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the Frigidaire EFMIS129-WHITE 6 Can Beverage Cooler as a birthday gift for my brother, hoping to surprise him with a cute and functional addition to his space. While the fridge itself is aesthetically pleasing and serves its purpose well, there is one significant drawback that cannot be ignored: the noise.The compact size of this beverage cooler is ideal for small spaces, making it a convenient option for keeping a few drinks chilled. Its white color adds a touch of elegance and blends well with various room decors. The fridge's performance in terms of cooling beverages is satisfactory, ensuring that drinks stay refreshingly cold.However, the noise level of the Frigidaire EFMIS129-WHITE 6 Can Beverage Cooler is quite noticeable and, for some, may be bothersome. My brother reported that the noise emitted by the fridge was enough to give him a headache. It's disappointing that such a cute little appliance comes with this drawback, as it can affect the overall user experience.Despite the noise issue, the fridge does provide adequate storage space for up to six cans, making it suitable for personal use or small gatherings. It is energy efficient and does not consume excessive power, which is a positive aspect.If you're considering purchasing the Frigidaire EFMIS129-WHITE 6 Can Beverage Cooler, it's important to be aware of the potential noise level. While it may not bother everyone, those sensitive to noise or looking for a quieter cooling option might find it inconvenient.In conclusion, the Frigidaire EFMIS129-WHITE 6 Can Beverage Cooler is a cute and compact fridge that serves its purpose of chilling beverages. However, the noticeable noise level can be a drawback for some users, leading to potential discomfort or headaches. If noise is not a significant concern for you or the intended recipient, this beverage cooler can still be a stylish addition to your space.Note: Consider the noise tolerance of the recipient or your own preferences before purchasing the Frigidaire EFMIS129-WHITE 6 Can Beverage Cooler.",
