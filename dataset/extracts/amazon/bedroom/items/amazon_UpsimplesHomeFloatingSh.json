                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars EXCELLENT! Renter-friendly, easy to install, holds decent weight!",
                "reviewText": "First, I am a 5'1 girl with near zero experience with hanging, installing, constructing, etc. I managed to get all the shelves up and decorated in about an hour and a half, including a 20-minute break to call my brother to ensure I was doing it right.These were SUPER easy to install. The only tool of my own that I needed was a screwdriver. I have drywall walls, so I did not need much to get everything into the wall. If you have concrete, brick, etc., the instructions recommend having a drill for your initial hole and a hammer to put in the anchor. They come with all the screws you need, all the anchors (both types), a mini level, instructions, and extra screws and anchors. All I did to install these was mark the holes with a pencil, make a small hole there with my screwdriver, and then push the anchor in, screw it into place, and screwdrive the shelve into the anchor. So easy that even I (a mechanical idiot) could do it.Second, as you can see from the pictures, I don't have anything super heavy on them, but some items have weight. I am not sure of an exact number, but I would say that 5 pounds is no problem at all. 10 pounds would probably be fine. More than that, I cannot speak to. For regular office shelves, they are perfect. Other reviewers put these shelves in their bathrooms, and they seemed to do well. As for book shelving, I'm not sure they are the best due to the depth of the shelves more than the weight. But so far, I have loved them for brightening up my office!Third, I think these are great renter-friendly items! I took a picture of the little holes that I had to make in the wall in order to assemble these. With some plaster or joint compound and a bit of paint, these would be easily concealed in no time! They are also super easy to take down! I had one a little misplaced and easily took it out and was able to conceal the old hole behind the shelf that can be covered up when I move out.Overall, I would say1. Worth the time to put them up. They took about an hour to install, and like I said, I am not the handiest person.2. Worth the money spent. These are decent quality and have held up against me dropping stuff or knocking into them. Only time will tell how long they last, but so far so good!3. Worth the holes in the wall. I think this was most important for me as a renter. I didn't want to put any huge holes in the wall, because I wouldn't know how to repair something like that. I also didn't want to put them up and hate them, but fortunately, they are super cute!I think these are great for anyone, experienced or not, who wants to spruce up a space with a little decor. These shelves are easy to install and uninstall. They are not super expensive. And they are very cute and easy to decorate! Worth the time and money, would definitely recommend them!",

I combined them with some thrifted artwork, artificial plants, battery operated candles, etc. and made a pretty gallery wall for my bedroom.The front edge keeps your decor from sliding off which works well for picture frames or propped up decor. If you wanted to, you could also mount the shelves upside down for a smooth top surface.The package includes a level which was handy, but the anchors aren\u2019t great. I struggled to install the shelves until I used my own hardware, and after that it was smooth sailing. Do yourself a favor and buy your own anchors.",
