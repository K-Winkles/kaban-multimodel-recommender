                "reviewText": "This mirror is amazing quality. Heavy in weight, precise with the mounting holes at the back and the metal corners met perfectly for a high quality look at a great price point!! I purchased 2 to place above my bedside dressers (behind my table lamps). The slim frame gives it an elegant look that's subtle and brings height to my bedroom. Not to mention reflects more light. Although there is a metal stand to prop it up, as a free standing mirror, disassemble was easy and the mirror lays flat up against the wall when mounted. I was afraid that (because of the length) it may warp or bow. But the heavy metal keeps it completely flat. And there is little to no gap between the mirror and wall.The packaging was super secure and had no damages during delivery. Not too heavy. I will definitely consider purchasing again for other decor projects.",

                "reviewText": "Love it. The mirror is really terrific. Even with a kickstand back it's a sturdy low profile & barely takes up any extra room. Totally distortion free & a clean modern look. Just a great value for the money.Even with the seller's disclaimer that it would arrive a week after Christmas, surprisingly it arrived a week BEFORE the Holiday.(Note: FYI, if you're gifting it, there IS an image of the mirror on the outside of the shipping box.)Packing was just as impressive as the mirror inside. When I saw the size of the flat shipping box, (and a couple of small shipping indentations in the face of cardboard box...I *hoped* I wouldn't find a cracked or damaged item inside. BIG CUDOS to the engineer who designed that packing box. He/she deserves a Medal. Safecased inside the heavy double cardboard outer box was a sturdy wooden shipping frame supporting the mirror inside. The mirror was then sandwiched between 2 layers of Styrofoam on both the front & back of it. The shipper could have launched that box off the Empire State Building w/o ANY damage.I can't imagine any way anyone could be disappointed with the mirror or the seller.5\u2606s all around.",

                "reviewText": "I love this mirror! \ud83e\ude77 I wanted a full-size mirror for my bedroom but didn't want to take up door space by hanging one. I ordered this one and the first delivery showed up cracked at the top of the frame in a spiderweb like pattern. Also, the packing shows it was supposed to come in a wooden type box frame and this was not included with the mirror. The only protection it had was Styrofoam. \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I ordered a replacement and this one showed up in perfect condition \ud83d\ude0d (see photo). I would definitely recommend this mirror as it can either be hung or you can use the stand legs that are attached as I have done. However, given my first delivery experience you can choose for yourself; personally I feel the broken mirror was likely a result of poor delivery standards on the particular driver who dropped my package off (as, he originally delivered a package to me, told Amaon that it was delivered, and when I went outside to get it, the package was a carpet addressed to a woman 5 miles away\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f).PS. Peep my dog sleeping in on my bed in the mirror for your daily dose of serotonin today \ud83d\ude0d",
