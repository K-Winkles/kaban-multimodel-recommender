Our classroom celebrated 100 years last spring and has an older musty smell, especially after a rain. With my purifier I do not smell any lingering mustiness or meals after we've cleaned up. Many other teachers have complimented how nice and fresh our room smells, and they have purchased these as well.Pros: ease of use (continously or timer work well), easy filter change, maximum quality air for our fairly large classroom, excellent coverage, I like the color display for fun ambienceCons: none to report. (Though I do wish the cord was somewhat thicker so it did not catch as easily.)",

CADR 110 so not bad for a small room.I have it in the family room adjacent and open to the kitchen and I cooked fish a day ago and can still smell it with the purifier running 24 hours daily. It\u2019s not too loud on medium but on high it\u2019s pretty noisy. The filter is larger than most which is a good thing. Seems like it\u2019s built well.

Nothing cheap here.The Air Purifier is a great size, great instructions. I received this one less than hour ago, it was that easy & quick to locate the filter & adapter, put it together and start it up. The operating panel is easy to use, it is touch sensitive, nice. It is in the living/dining rooms open area, my kitchen is near but not too close. This morning I cooked bacon, now mind you I don\u2019t mind smelling bacon, however this little Air Purifier took it upon itself to remove it immediately! It is not even that near my kitchen! WOW! I am impressed so I order another one for my bedroom. I played with the light too making sure everything woks, nice little touch.Noise\u2026 I have excellent hearing, the lowest level is so quiet it startled me, the other levels are soft white noise, not loud & not obtrusive either.I really like this Air Purifier and I do recommend it",

I placed it in between the living room and the kitchen, somewhere in the center. So that we can try if it's really going to purify the air cause normally if we cook fish or any other food with strong scent, the smell of it spreads everywhere inside the house. As a throwback when we don't have a purifier, strong scent from cooking takes several hours before it subsides, but when we tried using air purifier, it didn't take that long and the smell of food eventually became barely noticeable. I can tell that it's really doing its job in just a short period of time because on the filter it has now faint particles attached on it. We haven't used it for a month yet, that's why it's too faint.Also, they have a very informative and accommodating customer service when I checked on them if the item is ozone-free and they assured me that it is indeed ozone-free. That's exactly what I'm looking for and the great deal was just an addition on me liking this product.",

I\u2019m going to get a different filter besides the one it comes with and see if that helps. The lowest setting is practically silent, but the higher two settings are very loud.

This helped filter the air in my bedroom so the sleep mode came in very handy. It didn't stop it happening completely and also meant I needed to keep the windows closed, but keeping curtains closed during the day to helped cool the room before sleeping.",
