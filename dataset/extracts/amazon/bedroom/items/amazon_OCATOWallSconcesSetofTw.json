They are rechargeable and come with a remote so they are easy to turn off and on. They are magnetic and stick to the inside of the shade. The shades are easy to hang and come with a sticky hook. The lights change color and are dimmable which is a very nice feature. The only downside is the battery life won\u2019t last long if you keep them on for long periods of time. Other than that these are perfect!",

I used Liquid Stitch fabric glue (but any fabric glue will work). They are easy to do since the shade will lay completely flat, making it easy to make a pattern and to glue it all down. I added ribbon to the top part to finish the look and hide the frayed edges. They look gorgeous and now fit my boho lifestyle. And they look gorgeous when lit up and the rotating colors are displaying. (I love these lights, they are easy to set up, easy to move around and install, easy to recharge, easy easy easy!!!)",

                "reviewText": "My experience with these lights has left me less than impressed. The adage \"you get what you pay for\" rings true in this case.The lighting options are disappointingly limited, offering only a BRIGHT white setting with no option to switch to a warmer tone. This lack of variety makes it challenging to create a cozy ambiance, limiting the overall appeal of these wall lights.Additionally, the choice of paper material for the lights is questionable. It bends and creases far too easily, compromising the aesthetic and durability of the product. It feels like a cheap material that doesn't live up to the standards I expected.If you're in search of versatile lighting with a durable build, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. These sconces fall short in both functionality and quality, making them a less-than-ideal choice for those seeking reliable battery-operated wall lights.",
