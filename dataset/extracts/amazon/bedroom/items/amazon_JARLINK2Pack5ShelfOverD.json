That was great. The issue was the pockets are much closer together than I expected, so putting the towels in\u2026they barely fit.The other issue is when you hang it on a door\u2026depending on their weight of whatever you put in each pocket, the lower pockets pull away from the door. I had to order some really strong Velcro strips to have it lay flat against the door. It wasn\u2019t the end of the world, but without ordering the Velcro strips, it swung around too much.",
