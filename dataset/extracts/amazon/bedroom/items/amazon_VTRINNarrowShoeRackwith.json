            "Large Capacity yet Space Saving -- This 10 tier narrow shoe rack is ideal for small space. Its dimensions are of 17.7\"L x 11.8\"W x 68.9\"H yet it\u2019s able to hold up to 20-22 pairs of shoes, making it a great tall shoe rack for closet, cabinet, wardrobe, entryway and bedroom. It can also be a great closet storage organizer for your books and other stuff.",
            "Dustproof Cover & Non-woven Layers -- The shoe rack with cover comes with a high quality dustproof cover so you can zip it up to keep dust off your shoes and stuff, providing you a more tidy and cozy home. Moreover, the cover is designed with side pockets where you can collect your keys, cards or other gadgets. The fabric layers prevent dust and water from falling into other shoes. Most importantly, it\u2019s much more convenient and suitable for storing high heels. No more falling through the slots.",
            "Sturdy & Easy to Assemble -- Our vertical shoe organizer is made of upgraded 13mm sturdy corrosion-resistant metal pipes and strengthened pp connectors, which provides outstanding stability and load capacity. Installation is as easy as ABC. You may check the video in the photo gallery section for reference. Besides, a mini wooden hammer is included for labor-saving.",
            "Stackable & Dividable & Diyable -- The shoe storage is stackable and dividable, so you can split the shoe stand into 2 5-tier shoe rack, or into 1 6-tier and 1 4-tier shoe rack. The height of each single layer is about 6.7\u201d, but you can remove 1-2 layers off to build a larger cell for your kneel boots, big toys or other storage organization boxes.",
            "Portable & Easy to Clean - This shoe rack with dustproof cover is compact yet light weight. You can easily move and place it to the place you planned for it after installation. Cleaning is super easy too. The cover and layers are waterproof. Just wipe them with a wet cloth if needed."

It came with everything needed for assembly and was relatively easy to assemble. It cleans up my space nicely and hides my shoes from my dogs. Boots and heels fit nicely sideways. I attached my before & after (with more shoes).",

It was very easy to assemble, be sure to use the wooden mallet that is provided. Everything fits together perfectly with no screws. I love the room it provides for storage. It's very sturdy and a very well made product. I love the fact that there is a zippered closure . A fantastic value for the money. I love it so much I am getting ready to order 2 more. BTW this \"shoe\" rack can be used for much more than just shoes. Think outside of the box...my husband has a lot of golf caps, this will be perfect for organizing and storing his collection.",

                "reviewText": "This slim profile shoe organizer is perfect for small spaces. It holds over 20 pairs of shoes and it fits perfectly in the space between my bedroom door and the door to my closet! I purchased it to get my many pairs of shoes out of their boxes and display them in the slim(low) profile rack.it\u2019s very easy to assemble and takes minimal time to set up. It\u2019s surprisingly sturdy and is only about 12 inches deep, so it conveniently holds most shoes and boots. It comes with a black slip cover that has a roll up and Velcro attached front panel for easy viewing and accessibility. My only complaint is with the slip cover tie downs, as they\u2019re not sewn on very strongly and one tore loose with the initial setup. It\u2019s not a major issue. It just doesn\u2019t fit as snuggly as it should at the bottom- a minor cosmetic inconvenience! That\u2019s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Overall it was just what I was looking for with a small footprint and thin design, and lastly the price was outstanding! If you have multiple pairs of shoes and need a place to store and display them, this is a perfect option. They also have many different sizes and quantities available. A pretty great purchase.",
