One of them came with a ripped corner, but I guess it was sewn wrong, anyway I'm not going to return them just for that, since I don't think it's going to get fully ripped, I only put small things in there.",

So if you have OCD or like neat and clean stuff I 10/10 recommend!!! Go buy it now!!! Your welcome \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",

They also supply two additional pieces in the package for display purposes. Two door hooks and two velcro straps for each organizer. The door hooks are cheaply made and immediately snapped the second I closed the door but the velcro held them in place nicely. (If the hooks snap on you, you can run to the dollar store and easily get some replacements) For the value and quality, I would recommend this product.",
