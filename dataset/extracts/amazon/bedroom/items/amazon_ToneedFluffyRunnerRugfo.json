It is amazing soft and the backing does grip the tile floors so it doesn\u2019t slip! You can\u2019t find a better deal for this size (4x6) rug. It is man made material and does smell when the package is first opened, so take it out for \u201cairing out\u201d for a few hours. I assume it\u2019s the package that gave it the smell as I\u2019m not smelling it since. And sooooft!! It is so soft I actually bought one to use as a bed cover! I have bought 4 of these now. That should say it all ! Don\u2019t hesitate to get one.",

My toddler and I love the softness of the fur, we spend hours playing and relaxing on it. The only downside is that after several months it is impossible to clean and is ready for the garbage. But that is expected of a cheap rug. Overall I think it's a great choice unless you have the bucks to spend on a real expensive one...",
