I do not allow shoes in my place and needed something to put our shoes on instead of them being lined up at the front door taking up too much space. It's lightweight, and a good choice for space. I will be buying a second 1 to put next to this one for when guest arrive to put their shoes on. The quality seems not so great but I think for the price it's perfect. It seems to feel like it's made up of plastic or very thin metal so be careful not to put too much presure or it will bend. It does come with instructions but the assemble was super easy. I say yes to buying\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe",

It fits the space I had exactly as it needed to, and despite the apparent flimsiness, is surprisingly sturdy enough to do its job. There's room for 6 pairs of average sized adult shoes, no trouble. It saves so much closet space this way and I can't argue with the price, so overall a good buy.",

It is literally the easiest thing to put together and, surprisingly, it\u2019s very sturdy. I\u2019ve bumped and kicked it multiple times and never had any issues with it. I love it!!!",

                "reviewText": "The Jucaifu Stackable Small Shoe Rack left me thoroughly disappointed. The metal used in its construction is far from sturdy; it bends easily, compromising the entire rack's stability.Flimsy Construction: \u2b50\ufe0fThe metal components bend under minimal pressure, making the entire shoe rack wobbly and unreliable. It's frustrating to see such a lack of durability, especially for a product designed to bear the weight of shoes.Unstable Design: \u2b50\ufe0fThe stackable feature, intended to be a space-saving advantage, ends up contributing to the instability of the rack. Assembling it according to the instructions doesn't alleviate the wobbliness, making the design flawed and impractical.Not Worth the Price: \u2b50\ufe0fGiven the flimsy construction, the Jucaifu Stackable Shoe Rack simply isn't worth the price. There are more robust alternatives on the market at a similar or even lower cost, making this purchase regrettable.Inadequate Support: \u2b50\ufe0fThe shoe rack fails to provide the reliable support one would expect. Shoes constantly slip off due to the instability, creating a mess and defeating the primary purpose of having a shoe rack in the first place.Final Verdict:The Jucaifu Stackable Small Shoe Rack's disappointing quality, particularly its easily bendable metal and lack of sturdiness, makes it a regrettable purchase. If you're looking for a reliable and durable shoe storage solution, it's best to explore other options on the market. \ud83d\udc5f\ud83d\udc4e",

                "reviewText": "I'm using this rack inside my door that enters from garage. It is perfect for me to step out of my wet wintery shoes/ boots I placed it on top of my tray shoe rack to catch any wetness that may come off my shoes or boots Plenty of room if I have a guest or two that comes in. I should really order another one to put at front door for those who come in from there. It was easy to put together. I would recommend to anyone who only has a small area. I think it is very convenient to have.",
