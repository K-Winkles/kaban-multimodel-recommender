My only advice is to be careful you don't tighten the screws too far or you might split the wood around the screw (totally my fault). I flipped a board over after I accidentally did this on one screw and it looks fine. Very sturdy and looks good in the room. My son loves the built in charging ports.",

                "reviewText": "Living in an old house, electrical outlets are at a premium. And life in the modern age demands plugs and USB ports. I don't like surge protectors with multiple plugs because, I'm either a) stubbing my toe on the on button, leaving nothing protected (including my toe) or b) stumbling around in the dark when the alarm goes off, kicking the surge protector out of the wall. When I saw that this table had two outlets and A USB PORT, I purchased it. It arrived in a very small, flat box which I found, at first, intimidating. How could a table fit in this tiny box? Assembly could not have been easier. You have the option of a drill, a screwdriver or an enclosed Allen wrench. We all know how to use an Allen wrench. All like pieces were in their own numbered bags, in the order that they were needed. You put 1 and 2 (shelves) together first. You use bag 3 to secure 1 to 2. You righty-tighty the screws until they stop turning. The outlet/USB panel is the last to go. Total assembly time was maybe a half hour and the instructions were really helpful. It's also very Mission-style looking, very dark wood, which I like. It's the perfect height for charging your phone at night, for placing your alarm clock and for plugging in a lamp. I love it and would absolutely buy another one.",
