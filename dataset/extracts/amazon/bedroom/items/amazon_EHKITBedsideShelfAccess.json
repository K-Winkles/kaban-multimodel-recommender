                "reviewText": "When I ordered this I had stuck it on the wall beside my bed to store my phone and vape when I wasn't using them because I'm always losing my things. It stuck for probably about two days before it fell and then continued to fall every time I put it back up. I then tried using command strips but something about the plastic made them stick to the wall just fine but not to the shelf so it just kept falling off the command strips too. Then I gave up and it's in a closet somewhere lol. If you have a better way of mounting it to the wall than me then I'd say go for it but it's definitely not easy.",
