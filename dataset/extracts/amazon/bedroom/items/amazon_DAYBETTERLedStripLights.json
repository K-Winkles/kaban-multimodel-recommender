They were super cheap, and they came with two rolls, I only used one, and this one covered my whole entire room and I haven't even opened the other one yet. I was annoyed because the remote wasn't working at all and it was really annoying to use but I downloaded the DayBetter app and it connected super easy and now I can control the lights with my phone and there's hundreds of color options. Will buy again! These are just pictures of my them around my door but I think it gives you a pretty good idea. It wraps around my dresser my closet below my bed all the way around my room they are so long.",

                "reviewText": "surprisingly its adhesive stuck really good to my wall, and it hadn't been cleaned in a while (I forgot to clean it before applying) so that's definitely a good quality. in my opinion, they could be a bit brighter but its not bad at all. decent brightness at its max. I was worried the remote control wouldn't work well from a few feet away, but it actually has range. As long as you point the front of the remote towards the plugin, or its base it will work from at least 5-6 feet away, maybe even more. my room isnt exactly that big, but its honestly the perfect length. so from my experience, the remote, adhesive, and brightness are all amazing. the brightness is the only thing you could say is off, but most people would probably not even notice. for its price, i would say these are some great LEDs. i recommend if you get a bad batch of them, make sure to return them and get another pair. overall great LEDs and easy to do. also if your not that good with directions, or actually even if you are i would just recommend reading the manual. im not that good with putting on LEDs since ive only done it maybe once or twice. maybe thats just me but its pretty useful. also if they dont work at first try switching the sides of the white parts, (the ones with the small stick-like shapes on them, idk what theyre called..) and they will work.sorry for a bunch of add-ons to this, but i had a lot to say. overall amazing LEDs, do recommend.",

They're more dramatic at night but even in the daylight they bring a little life and fun to an otherwise dull and awkward area. Easy install and I like how they blend in with the walls when not in use.The bad:I could not get the app to work on Android, it was kind of bare bones and annoying to need an account for it. It didn't like my gmail and kept saying \"Incorrect Email Format\" or something but thankfully the remote is enough.",

I was most worried about them not being bright enough but on the brightest setting with white as shown in photos it lights up the room nicely.cutting them is the only issue. You will cut out a foot or 2 of lights depending on where you cut. so experiment with extra length to where exactly you need to cut and you might end up a little short or long.Hope this makes sense. I highly recommend! cheap and exacly what I was hoping for!also when I installed I didnt put firm preassure on them and they are holding up nicely but you will have to clean the wall first otherwise they wont stick to the wall well enough.",
