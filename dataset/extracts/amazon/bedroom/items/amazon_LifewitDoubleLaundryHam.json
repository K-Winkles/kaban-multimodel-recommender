We bring laundry downstairs to do and this is so easy. I hate having to undo the little clip things but it only takes a second. I was also afraid the bags would break with my towels in them but so far so good. The actual hamper itself it super light to push around but I wouldn\u2019t recommend picking it up to bring to your washer- it holds too much. The cover is flimsy but I don\u2019t really care. It\u2019s small and cute.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Lifewit Double Laundry Hamper with Lid and Removable Laundry Bags, and I must say, it has greatly improved my laundry organization and storage. This hamper offers a practical and stylish solution for keeping dirty clothes organized and out of sight.One of the standout features of this laundry hamper is its spaciousness. With its large capacity, I am able to easily fit a significant amount of laundry without it overflowing. The hamper is divided into two compartments, allowing me to separate my clothes by color or type. This feature is especially useful for those who prefer to sort their laundry before washing.The lid of the hamper is a great addition as it keeps the laundry out of sight and prevents any unpleasant odors from spreading. The lid is also possible to stay open which is convenient when I need to quickly toss in a last-minute item without having to open the entire hamper.The included removable laundry bags are a practical feature that makes doing laundry a breeze. The bags are made of durable material and are easy to remove and carry to the washing machine. This eliminates the need for additional laundry baskets or bags, saving space and simplifying the laundry process.The hamper is collapsible, which is a major advantage for those with limited storage space. When not in use, I can easily fold it flat and tuck it away in a closet or under a bed. The sturdy handles on the sides of the hamper make it easy to carry, even when it is full of laundry.The overall build quality of the Lifewit Double Laundry Hamper is impressive. The fabric is durable and the stitching is well done, ensuring that it will withstand regular use. The neutral grey color of the hamper is also a nice touch, as it blends well with any home decor.In terms of functionality and convenience, the Lifewit Double Laundry Hamper with Lid and Removable Laundry Bags is a fantastic choice. It offers ample storage space, easy organization, and a stylish design.
