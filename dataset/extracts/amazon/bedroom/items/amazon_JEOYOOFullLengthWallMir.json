Up close the reflection is great, but the further away it becomes a bit Picassoed. I used them in my Pilates Studio and my clients thinks it is great. Even though the further reflections are a bit off, it still serves the purpose so clients can see their form. Each pack of 8 was about $15 so I mirrored the wall for about $60 and I don't have to worry about it getting broken or knocked off the wall.",

                "reviewText": "I will start by saying that 3 out of 4 panels were great. The mirror is a tad distorted, but would have worked well for the reason I bought it. This was purchased as a cheap/safer option for my baby's nursery to play with during tummy time. The adhesive is great, mirror is plastic so I am not concerned about shattering, and the edges are rounded. My review stars were based off of the reasons listed. My one problem was that the top panel had a deep cut taken out of it, possibly from a box cutter in the factory? There were no cuts on the packaging, so I am unsure how it happened. This was disappointing as I would need all 4 panels to make a square and did not feel comfortable leaving a sharp cut within baby's reach. However, customer service responded very quickly and refunded what I spent so I am not upset! I ended up making a tall rectangle with the 3 remaining panels and called it a day. Good product, you get what you pay for. Even better customer service!",

It's like I'm looking in those mirrors at the fair on that thing you walk through.\" And it did!!! They made us look 3x larger (width wise) than we actually are. We're average size I'm 5'3, shes 5'5. My husband thought we were kidding and was making jokes until he stood in front of it and was like \"DAMN! These even make me look fat.\" He's 6'3 and 220#The stickies they give you, are out of this world! They deserve 500 stars! We removed them with heat and it STILL ripped the paint off, and the drywall paper off clean down to the gypsum.Honestly, I love mirrors. I thought these were going to be perfect and I would have kept them if I was going to use it to bounce light around my dark house. I have nowhere to put them though. I have a million other ideas for them, just not good as an actual mirror you'd use on the daily to get ready with.",
