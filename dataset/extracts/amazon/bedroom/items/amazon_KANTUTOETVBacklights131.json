I\u2019d say that these are actually more dim than my old lights which is really saying something and a bit of a bummer. So if brightness is something you\u2019re looking for, I would keep looking. Also, my remote doesn\u2019t like to work unless it\u2019s in direct view of the strip lights \u2026 so I have to get up and point the remote to the back of the tv which, once again, my old usb strip lights prevail because they didn\u2019t require that.",
