                "reviewText": "Other than the velcro coming off due to the heat, the secondary transparent adhesive worked better. It made a noticeable difference in the reduction heat, darkness and cooling required. You can make it look nice or even as a quick install with rough cuts it still does the job. This has made it significantly more pleasant to work by the balcony sliding glass doors, plus at night time it is pitch black, great for movies.",

                "reviewText": "We built in a new neighborhood not realizing that a street lamp was being installed right outside the guest bedroom. We needed a quick solution for visiting family. The blackout material was easy to install. It did fall down the first night but that was because I was trying to use minimal adhesive strips, only using two. Once I added two at the bottom as well, it hasn't fallen since. It is nice and dark for sleeping. I consider this only a temporary solution until I can get heavier drapes made. I wouldn't want to have to take this down everyday, but I guess you easily could.",

                "reviewText": "I got this for my nursery because the curtains that I bought were falsely marketed as blackout curtains. This product comes in one long sheet (like a thick shower curtain material), has a slight chemical odor, and a project to cut into smaller window squares. BUT easy to stick to the window, stays in place, and really is 100% blackout! I cut into smaller halves of the window squares to be up against the glass and the adhesive provided works wonderfully! 10 out of 10 recommend!",

The sticky pads that it came with work phenomenal and can be removed if you ever want to take it down or move it. Which I was surprised about, I thought they would for sure strip the paint on the walls or something, but it didn't. I love these and would use these over curtains to be honest. They're pretty cheap also!",
