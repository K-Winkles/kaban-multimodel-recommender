                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Nice Basic Alarm Clock",
                "reviewText": "I previously had a radio/alarm clock with battery backup where the battery backup stopped working. We have frequent power interruptions, so I wanted an alarm with battery backup. I don't ever use the radio feature, so one with just alarm was sufficient. And I like having two alarm settings. This clock fit the bill at a reasonable price, and other reviews seemed good. I like that all the routinely used time and alarm controls are easily accessible on the top. Some other alarm clocks have these settings on the back, which is inconvenient. The clock and alarm times are easy to set, and controls are obvious and intuitive. The \"Dimmer\" button allows you to easily adjust the brightness of the display. When Alarm 1 and/or 2 is set, little images appear on the left side of the screen showing they are on. Pressing the \"Alarm Off\" button turns these off (press once if only one alarm is set, press again if both are set). To set the alarms, press the one you want to set (Alarm 1 or Alarm 2), and the display will start flashing. Use the hour and minute buttons to set. Once set, the time will continue to flash for a few seconds then hold at what you set. Or you can press the alarm button again or the \"Snooze/OK\" button to stop the flashing and register your setting. You can adjust the alarm volume with the Volume +/- buttons on the left side of the clock. A tone is sounded each time you press so you can hear the volume. When the alarm goes off, pressing the Snooze button will give you an extra 9 minutes until it goes off again. Or you can press the \"Alarm Pause\" or \"Alarm Off\" button. \"Alarm Pause\" turns off the particular alarm (1 or 2) for 24 hours so it won't beep again until the next day. \"Alarm Off\" turns it off so it won\u2019t beep again until you turn it back on. Once you set times for the Alarm 1 and Alarm 2, these times are retained each time you turn them off and back on, unless you change them. (This seems obvious, but I mention it only because one review I read seemed to indicate this might not be the case.) You can tell if Alarm 1 and/or 2 is set to go off by whether the small icons on the left side of the screen are showing. If an alarm is off, just press the Alarm 1 and/or 2 button to turn back on. The icon will then display on the screen.There is a button on the right side of the clock to toggle modes between either 12 hour (AM/PM) or 24 hour (e.g., military time). Also, if you hold this button in for about 3 seconds, it will add an hour to the current time and display a little \"DST\" (daylight savings time) symbol on the right side of the face (i.e., \"Spring forward\"). Pressing it again for about 3 seconds will subtract an hour and remove the DST symbol (i.e., \"Fall back\"). This saves having to re-set the time twice a year. All very logical and intuitive.One other thing to mention. Several unboxing videos by some reviewers seem to wonder what the two little black square pieces are that are packaged with the clock. I'm not sure why this seems confusing. These are obviously feet. They each have a little post on them, and there are a couple of holes in the back of the clock to insert them. These are easy to insert and fit snugly. They provide a little more width to the base to make the clock more stable, so it won't tip over when you go to hit the Snooze or Alarm Pause or Off buttons.The only slight negative observation I have is that the display can be a little glary and washed out in bright sunlight when viewed from across the room. Making the display brighter helps, but then it is too bright if you wake up and look at the time during the night. As a result, I tend to set the display brightness towards one of the middle settings. This is obviously a personal preference that will vary. All-in-all, this is a nice little alarm clock with big numbers that are easy to read without glasses at a very reasonable/inexpensive price.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a clock with just the absolute basics, so I chose this one.The display is nice and bright (I bought the white display, blue on black seemed dimmer). Setting the time and alarms took maybe a minute.This is a nitpick, but I was slightly confused to see that turning off the alarm is \"Alarm Pause\" and erasing the alarm is \"Alarm Off.\" I can see myself deleting the alarm I set while I'm still in my morning haze.Speaking of the alarm, it's LOUD. It doesn't seem that loud when you're setting it up, but it packs a real punch when you're half asleep and hungover. I'm such a heavy sleeper I usually have to use puzzle alarms, but this clock's shrill awful noises are almost magical in how fast they get me out of bed.I have no use/need for the USB charging port so I can't comment on it.",

I was able to adjust the brightness effortlessly. I was amazed at the price. It's very sleek and blends into the background. Perfect.",
