The red is easily readable in the dark even without my glasses. The only minus is that when set on the dimmest setting it's not really visible in the daytime. There is a feature that brightens or dims automatically, but it brightens too early in the morning for us. A great feature if you have to wake up early! Otherwise I love it! I also like that the clock is small, so it doesn't take up much space on my nightstand.",

It was working ok until the last few weeks, the time visibility fluctuates between the bright setting and off on its own now, and I\u2019ve made sure there wasn\u2019t a kink in the power cord and it even has a battery backup installed.

A USB cable is provided, so plug this into a powered USB port or provide your own AC adapter. There are three brightness levels, quite adequate. Keep the clock on a level surface. The buttons for setting the time and brightness and 24H/12H selection are not easy to use, but I figured it out. I do not use the alarm, but keep an eye on the display to ensure you didn't accidentally enable the alarm. The AM/PM indicator is so small that it's not very useful, but since I don't use the alarm, it doesn't matter to me. I need a clock that is permanently lit for day and night use and readable from 15 feet, and this works for me.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Is it a decent clock? Yes, but......",
                "reviewText": "Like others have said, it's about the size of a smartphone, but the numbers are big and clear so it's perfectly readable even from across a room. The lowest brightness setting is perfect for nighttime even in a bedroom: The numbers are bright enough to read at a glance in the middle of the night but not so much that they make the room less dark. I put mine on the opposite side of my small bedroom, but it seems like it wouldn't be annoying even right next to the bed.That said, it's definitely a lot more cheaply made than what I would expect of something that costs $20. It's VERY lightweight, which might be good I guess if you want to wall mount it, but it feels like a breeze could knock it over. It does look nice when you've set it down somewhere, but when holding it/pressing the buttons/etc. it feels more like something from the $10-$15 range.Another thing worth noting is that it has a USB cord, not an actual plug for an outlet. On one hand I guess this means anyone in the world can buy it without worrying about outlet compatibility, but on the other hand it might necessitate an additional purchase of an adapter depending on where you're planning to plug it in. It does have USB ports on it, so I assume the intention is that you just plug it into a phone charger and then plug your phone into the clock when you want to charge it, but depending on where you keep your phone vs. where you want to put the clock, this may not be a viable solution.The main reason I'm taking stars off is that there doesn't seem to be much in the way of quality control. The surface of my clock had no protective film on it and was badly smudged up - easily cleaned, but not what you would expect when buying a new item. There was no plastic strip protecting the battery contact either, so I'm just kind of blindly trusting that the battery compartment isn't corroded. (I should probably open it and check, but, y'know... lazy.) It also already had an alarm set, and thank goodness I noticed before the alarm went off because it ALSO didn't have any instructions in the box, so I had to go back to the Amazon listing and search the Q&A to figure out how to turn the alarm off. And I feel lucky that the only things missing from my item were the instructions and a couple bits of protective plastic - there are plenty of other reviews that mention missing stands and even missing power cords. It very strongly gives the impression that they're taking returned clocks and just shipping them right back out without even opening the box to check the contents, let alone making any effort whatsoever to restore them to a \"new\" state before selling them at a \"new\" price.Is it a decent clock? Yeah, absolutely. As long as the USB thing isn't an issue for you and you don't set it down in a place where anything might bump it (because again, it won't take much to knock it over), it'll serve your digital timekeeping needs well. Do I recommend buying it? Not really, no. It's luck of the draw whether you get a complete package, missing parts, or maybe even a damaged clock... You're probably better off shopping for a different brand.",

                "reviewText": "Highly recommend this clock as a cute and stylish decorative piece to any room.Although the reviews shed a poor light on this clock, I believe most the poor reviews were due to the user instead of the actual clock.I'm not a 'tech savvy\" person but the set-up of this clock is super easy and if you read the instructions quiet clear on how to set it up properly.I'm not using it as an alarm clock, but it is very light weight and the stand isn't very sturdy so if you need to press a button regularly to turn it on and off this may be an issue.Other then that this is a trendy looking clock, that is easy to read, bright enough to see in any light and love the mirror background as a cool design touch!Love it!!!",
