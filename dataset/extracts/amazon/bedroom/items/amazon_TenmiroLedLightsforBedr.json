Turns and crosses walls frequently, no issues.I did have a brief issue where the lights were two different colors on the same strand if I folded them, but luckily I didn't have to do that, so they are all one color and just fine.The remote works great and so does the app, however the app is rated a 2.0 in the app store and people claim it stops working after awhile and is quite irritating to use, but so far it's fine with me. Some people reviewed the remote to stop working after while, but it hasn't stopped for me yet, so I'm hoping mine will be fine.The colors are super bright and vivid, the app giving you tons of new options to customize your colors in more specific ways that the remote doesn't offer.Lots of people reviewed these lights poorly due to color, remote issues, app issues, and adhesion, but so far everything is fine and dandy for me. I'll update this review if anything goes awry.(I have had these lights for about a month now.)",

It has been on the walls for 4 months now and no issues with it coming off the wall. The issues we have with it are that when it was placed in the room I didn't pay attention to where the sensor was and it is put beside a dresser that can't be accessed from the bed. You literally have to get up out of bed and walk to the side of the dresser to turn on the lights. You can download the app and it fixes this issue. However the app can cause issues too. We also have the lights in our living room and when the kids change the lights in their bedroom it changes the lights in the living room. Would buy again.",

                "reviewText": "We bought these for our two boys for Christmas. We were tired of replacing batteries in their little hand held night lights. Unfortunately, the one set we purchased was not working. It would light up but nothing controlled it, not the remote or app on phone. I tried unplugging and cleaning receptor off, replacing battery in remote\u2026. Yet the other box we purchased for another room worked perfectly fine.I tried to email the company from the contact us paper in the box yet the email was coming back undelivered. I then contacted Amazon support and we went through our options. Amazon refunded our money and did not ask us to return the lights. So I went ahead and purchased the lights again.Next day, the new set came in and we made sure to \u201cchange\u201d the light options to ensure it was working properly. We only needed the receptor from the new box, switched them out on the lights already on wall. It worked!!!After that unfortunate problem the lights have worked from the app on my phone. Easy to control, play music, etc. my two boys love having dance parties too. At first, I was upset we couldn\u2019t just play our own music without downloading from iTunes\u2026 but you can set the mic option and it hears music and does the beat with lights.Recommend these lights!!!",

                "reviewText": "These were really easy to install and having the adhesive on the back was perfect. They look really nice when up and I was able to mount them really straight. I have white trim in the room and even with the main lights on, you can barely notice the strips at all since they blend in so well. Two main issues:1. The brightness wanes over the length of the strips. This is hardly noticeable at all on most colors, but when you try to go to white lights, it's quite obvious. The symptom is that they start pure white but then at the end of the string look very yellow. It's hard to tell from photos but I've attached one here. The lights on the right are the start of the strand and the left are the end. You can see how yellow they look. My suspicion is that there isn't quite enough power being supplied to the strings to keep them bright the whole way. In particular the blue is reduced so you get more red and green - hence the more yellow look.2. The app stinks. It's completely not stable and hasn't seem to be updated in years. If you just happen to tap the same color twice in a row quickly, it crashes. If you want to dial in your own color, you can't see it adjust as you move the sliders. Tapping some of the other icons also cause a hard crash. I have used it only a bit and will likely rely on the remote. On the plus side, it was super simple to pair with my phone.So, overall pretty happy. And, I know I have to be realistic with such a low price for 100 feet.",

                "reviewText": "Thin plastic strip on a reel. 2 reels total. They both connect to the power at the same junction. You can make them go East & West, but they CANNOT go in a straight line to make them one long strip. If you want 1 long strip the plug will end up in the middle. Remote looks cheaply made and sometimes takes more than 1 try. Mine are on a timer, I did not try to program the remote at all. Much longer than I needed for my small cabinets, I was able to get plenty of lights above each section.",
