The temperature in it is a little lower than room temperature, but it\u2019s not enough to have a cold drink.Another issue is that the door is really hard to close, it does not stay in place. I have to press on it hard to get it locked.Otherwise, I have no leaking issues, and the noise level is very low.Update: the seller contacted me and replaced the fridge at no cost. The new one is much better, I have no issues with the door, and the temperature inside is lower. I am getting a little bit of water on the bottom though, but it\u2019s not a big deal since it\u2019s not much and it does not leak outside. I added a star for excellent customer service.",

I tested two items: a small bottle of Half and Half and a canned beverage. After keeping each item in the fridge for several hours (separate trials) I measured the temperature of the liquid. For both items, the temperature was 41 degrees Fahrenheit (colder than my home refrigerator kept these items).I am pleased with its trial performance. I\u2019ll bring it to work by my desk and see if its performance there is similar to the trials.",

Would not suggest for food or meds if the room temp is over 69\u00b0 as food kept between 40\u00b0F to 140\u00b0F is not reliably safe, and it only cools 30\u00b0F below room temp. Uses very little electricity, which is great. Was hoping to get a few more years out of it. I don't believe anyone can fix it locally, so this is it for this fridge.",

Bastante bonito y resistente, trae instrucciones y 2 tipos de cables gruesos ya sea para que lo conectes en tu casa o a tu autom\u00f3vil, solo deben recordar que tiene 2 funciones, ya sea enfriar o calentar y para ajustar eso tiene el interruptor atr\u00e1s. Tiene su agarradera que no parece pero aguanta bien. Y una repisa para acomodar, pero no congela. En lo personal lo us\u00e9 al principio para mascarillas y s\u00e9rums pero ahora lo tengo planeado para la cocina. Lo \u00fanico que no me gusta es que jam\u00e1s deja de trabajar el motor. Ya saben, como los refrigeradores para cocina, los grandes, hacen ruido un rato, se detiene y despu\u00e9s de muchas horas se vuelve a activar, pues este refrigerador jam\u00e1s para de trabajar y eso por desgracia genera m\u00e1s gasto en el servicio de electricidad",
