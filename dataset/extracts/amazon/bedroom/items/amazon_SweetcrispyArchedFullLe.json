                "reviewText": "The mirror is lovely and just what I needed. The stand folds out and stabilizes it nicely. I didn't want one that hangs over the door because those always bang around and look cheap. This one has a nice finish and came with hardware to hang it on the wall. I have plaster walls, so that wouldn't work. This is a great solution!But, before I could see the mirror to adore it, I had to cut open the ends of the box and carefully open the box lengthwise. I laid it on my bed to do this. Once the box was open, it was clear what other reviewers had said was true. The people who packaged this mirror for shipping are geniuses. It had several layers of Styrofoam for cushioning, sat in a wood frame for stabilization and protection, and had a piece of plastic to protect the mirror from smudging.",

I'm SO impressed! Not only is the mirror itself really decent quality - light weight and easy to maneuver but still *looks* heavy and expensive - but the packaging far exceeded my expectations. I've ordered mirrors online from other retailers and none of them have been packaged as well as this one! There was a wood border (wood!) lines with styrofoam all the way around the edge of the mirror and the flat sides were secured by even more styrofoam.If you are hesitating on ordering due for fear of damage via shipping I'd say you don't have to worry about that with this item. 100% worth it and really impressive quality for the price.",

Super disappointed because the mirror is beautiful & the perfect size. The only return option now is to send the damaged box & mirror back, wouldn\u2019t be a huge deal except I can\u2019t fit the mirror in my car to take it to UPS. So now I have two broken mirrors & loss of the money I spent to begin with. Lame.",

Therefore, I decided not to hang it on the wall, but just leaned it instead. It comes with directions and mounting screws to hang it on the wall. With the weight, I would feel more comfortable hanging from the wall studs. The spacing of the holes on the back of mirror seem to line up with where two studs would be in my wall.",
