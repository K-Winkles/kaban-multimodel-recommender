I ended up filing down the mounting holes to be flush with the motherboard and everything fit fine after that.

This wouldn't work on my Hyper 212 that I pulled from an LGA 1155 socket.As you can see in the photo, this was the only way I could mount it to the new LGA 1700 board using this kit. Needless to say, this was not ideal so I just used the stock Intel cooler for now.",
