                "reviewText": "I bought this CPU to put into a budget build for my girlfriend. This CPU is fantastic; she gets a solid 144fps with absolutely no frame drops under 100fps in Fortnite, Overwatch, and many others, and with the CPU being underpowered by a 1650 super I can only imagine how well it would run with something like a 3060. Also, I had read about and was expecting to have thermal issues with the stock cooler until I received the water cooler I ordered, but the cooler has had no problems keeping the CPU cool under load. The only thing I did was removed the pre-applied paste and applied some MX-6 thermal paste. Overall, great budget CPU for gaming.",
