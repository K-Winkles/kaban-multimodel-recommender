                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars 6 cores 12 threads super fast!",
                "reviewText": "This CPU is amazing. It is great at everything. It can game, multitask, stream, productivity, and more. It\u2019s priced good enough that even if you just want it for general computing it\u2019s still great. This thing comes pushed to the limit straight out of the box pretty much. Traditionally I overclock every CPU I buy but with this one AMD have pretty much pushed them to the max for us. Which is great because it\u2019s plug n play! Mine with PBO and Thermal Limits set to max stays around 4.250ghz on all cores gaming under full load with 1 of the 6 cores boosting to 4.35-4.15ghz. So in a game 5 cores will be at 4.250 ghz and one core will always be around 4.35-4.15ghz with that 1 core alternating so they take turns. This gives great ipc and single threaded performance as well as multithreaded. This gives high FPS in games due to the strong single core performance than a 4.3ghz all core overclock gets. You can basically set PBO to max and TBU to max and your motherboard and system will boost it as high as it can. It\u2019s amazing it\u2019s literally drop it in and your good to go this time around. No overclocking needed. I have this CPU in the Asus Prime X570-Pro motherboard if anyone was curious. It was 260 dollar board so it\u2019s pretty nice imo. So your numbers may be different than mine. For cooling I\u2019m using a simple Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo in Push/Pull with twin fans. Keeps my CPU in the mid 30sC idle, in the 50sC in gaming rather it\u2019s an hour or all day long. Under Prime 95 stress test it topped out at 76C then dropped back to 74C and stayed there. For a 35 dollar cooler pretty insane. I have great case air flow so if you do not do not expect these results. The best way to get more performance from your Ryzen CPU since it\u2019s basically pushed to the max out of the box is via memory. You can look it up if you wish. Memory speed significantly effects your cpus performance at least in gaming. It was shown going from 2666mhz to 3600mhz memory speed in games was giving huge FPS increases. In almost all games 10-20 FPS increase with some games increasing as much as 30-40fps. So if you buy a Ryzen CPU for the love of god buy 3600mhz memory with it. I have 32GB of G.Skill Ripjaws in mine all running at 3600mhz and that\u2019s using all 4 dimm slots 4x8GB sticks in duel channel mode. Fast memory paired with this CPU in a good motherboard means you don\u2019t have to overclock or touch anything this time around and you get amazing performance in all regards. I have my 3600x and 3600mhz memory paired with a RTX 2070 Super that is overclocked really well and I am playing any games I want at 1440P maxed out getting 100+ FPS in pretty much everything. If you want a nice CPU for gaming, streaming, content creation, or anything else well you\u2019re looking at one. At this point in time the Ryzen 3600XT is out now which is basically this exact CPU except it runs around 4.6ghz in the boosting alternative core and probably around 4.4 on the other 5 core. So you gain roughly about 200mhz over this 3600x by going with the XT. Rather that\u2019s worth it well that\u2019s up to you. At most the difference in FPS between the two might be 5 FPS at max. So just get whichever is the best deal. Even the Ryzen 3600 non X or non XT does very very similar in performance to the X and XT and is 150 dollars right now. Everything I said pretty much applies to all 3 CPUs they are just an amazing gaming chip.",

                "reviewText": "I recently became bond to my chair, and was looking to replace an old Intel processor to occupy my days. About the same time I started looking for computer equipment, AMD announced their new lineup of CPU's. I admit, I was pretty excited, and made almost every mistake the YouTubers warned us to avoid.Let's just say that I was ready to build a new PC way before AMD was ready for me to build what I wanted. I generally build a new machine every 5 years, and that was my plan this year. But, to get to 5 years, I felt I needed an X570 mobo, a Ryzen 9 3900X, 16 gigs of fast Ram, three M.2 drives, and an RTX 2080TI.Reality set in when I could not find a Ryzen 9 3900X, and the price of an RTX 2080TI, damnnnnnn. So, I changed my direction, and went with a Ryzen 5 3600X and a Vega 56 (which I found new for $270 - PowerColor Red Dragon).My thought was I could start with the 3600X, and resell it when the 3900X's were readily available. I had heard a lot about the Vega 56 (most of the information was to stay away for the card), but I decided it would be as much fun to play around with the Vega 56 as it would be to game with it. I think I made a good decision. My 3600X clock speed is always over 4300+MHz, and usually bounces between 4366MHz and 4399MHz. I am using an AIO and run the pump at full speed most of the time.The Vega 56 has been a wonderful GPU. Ok, no ray tracing, but I personally find Global WattMan incredibly easy to use, and I have no problem keeping the clock speed at 1643MHz. I have not put the Vega 64 bios on my Vega 56 yet, but I plan to soon.I did save some money with my current build. But, I still hope my wife will get me a Ryzen 9 3900X (I have no interest in the 3950X) for Christmas. If that does not happen, I will stick with my current CPU, and wait for a RX 5800 XT or RX 5900 XT if they ever come out; otherwise, will wait for the next AM5/6 CPU's when they come out.I really like my rig (highly Frankenstein'd case, with a Gigabyte X570 Aorus Pro Wifi - you can read my mobo review - I like the card very much). The PC will certainly last for 5 years, but not with me. I expect that once an AMD GPU with ray tracing becomes available, I will pick one up and sell the Vega 56. I will also sell my 3600X in a couple of years. The 3600X will hold its value I expect.It is hard to go wrong with whatever you decide to buy. Dont over spend and have fun is my only advice. I may have over spent, but I had a heck of a lot of fun.",

                "reviewText": "Esta \u00e9 a primeira vez que uso um processador da AMD nos meus PCs. Depois de ler muitos reviews e comparativos decidi fazer a experi\u00eancia e at\u00e9 o momento tudo est\u00e1 100%. O principal fator que me fez optar pelo AMD Ryzen 5 3600X foi n\u00e3o s\u00f3 a sua performance, superior ao Intel Core i5-9600K, mas tamb\u00e9m a compatibilidade com as novas arquiteturas rec\u00e9m lan\u00e7adas pela AMD. No caso da Intel, houve mudan\u00e7as de socket depois da nona gera\u00e7\u00e3o o que me colocaria sem possibilidade de upgrade sem a troca tamb\u00e9m da motherboard.Fazer upgrade de CPU e Motherboard em um computador com o Windows instalado j\u00e1 foi uma enorme dor de cabe\u00e7a, mas o processo com o Windows 10 foi extremamente tranquilo. Foi s\u00f3 trocar, ligar e o Windows fez (quase) tudo. Depois uma atualiza\u00e7\u00e3o de drivers e tudo certo.Para quem quer performance, escalabilidade e economia recomendo!",

                "reviewText": "TLDR: Don't underestimate the GTX 10 series graphics cards and drop $2000 on an RTX, when in reality it's the rest of your PC that's bottlenecking you! CPU's and DDR4 have had the best year ever for gamers, and GPU's just don't have much to offer over a few years ago. Why do you think Nvidia went all in on raytracing? it's because they are reaching the physical limits of GPU potential and are now adding features to make sales. CPU's are getting close to that point too so now is the time to buy one! Then wait 5 years, for the next breakthrough technology.I upgraded to DDR4, but kept my GTX 1080. This made an incredible difference! Not sure if it's the 3600x alone or if it's the sheer bandwidth of DDR4, but between the two, my graphics card is no longer bottlenecked and can achieve its full potential.You have to realize as well, I upgraded from the FX-8350, and 8 core 4.2 ghx CPU, it was the top of the line like 10 years ago and held strong even today, playing Fallout 4 on ultra settings at 4k 30fps. I wanted to upgrade to the RTX 2080 to get to 60fps, but it turns out that wouldn't have helped, because what I needed was the 3600xNow I run Fallout 4 on ultra at 4k well over 60fps in even the most demanding situations, using a GTX 1080Let me say that again, 4k60, with a GTX 1080... Sorry, im just really impressed!!!Right now I'm playing Plague Tale on ultra 4k, averaging about 44fps, which is more than acceptable :)",

                "reviewText": "Hardware (soweit relevant):- Prozessor: Ryzen 5 3600X ohne Overclocking (zuvor Ryzen 5 1600X)- Board: MSI X370 SLI PLUS- Prozessorl\u00fcfter: Arctic Freezer 13 Tower K\u00fchler (gefiel mir von der Ger\u00e4uschentwicklung schon auf dem 1600X, daher habe ich nicht den AMD L\u00fcfter verwendet/ ASIN B0048F64DU)- RAM: 32GB Crucial Ballistix Sport LT BLS2K16G4D32AESC 3200 MHz mit Overclocking auf 3333Mhz (ASIN: B07M5RKH5Z)- Grafik: MSI Geforce GTX1060 6GB- Geh\u00e4use: Be Quiet Silent Base 800Also, erstmal das neueste BIOS auf's Board gezogen, den 3600X mit dem Artic Freezer 13 eingebaut, den Rest des Rechners wieder montiert/angeschlossen und los ging's.Das Plus an Performance war deutlich sp\u00fcrbar (z.B. beim Boot und beim Start von Anwendungen, aber auch bei Nutzung des Web) und auch messbar (z.B. Cinebench R20 Multicore +1013 Punkte/ Cinebench R15 Multicore +427).Zu Beginn hatte ich auch das Problem, dass der Rechner im Leerlauf kaum unter 50 Grad (Celsius) zu bekommen war. Dann habe ich die aktuellen Chipsatz-Treiber installiert und siehe da, im Leerlauf nur noch 33-40 Grad und beim Stresstest kaum \u00fcber 70 Grad (l\u00e4sst sich auch auf \"ComputerBase\" im Forum nachlesen Post \"Ryzen 5 3600X zu hohe Temp\" Beitrag #20). Auch der Boost auf 4400 Mhz (angezeigt werden 4398 Mhz) funktioniert wie erwartet.Wer dann noch wegen der L\u00fcfterger\u00e4usche Probleme hat, kann die L\u00fcfterkrurve anpassen.Der Ryzen 5 3600X kostet derzeit ca. 200 \u20ac und bietet damit eine sehr gute Upgrade M\u00f6glichkeit, gerade auch f\u00fcr \u00e4ltere Boards. Den Ryzen 7 3700X bekommt man aber auch schon f\u00fcr ca. 90 \u20ac mehr (muss jeder f\u00fcr sich entscheiden). Das Plus an Leistung beim Wechsel vom 1600X auf den 3600X macht sich deutlich bemerkbar, nicht nur bei Benchmarks, sondern auch im t\u00e4glichen Betrieb. Zu hohe Hitze l\u00e4sst sich mit den aktuellen Chipsatz-Treibern beheben. Wem der AMD-L\u00fcfter zu laut ist, sollte noch ein paar Euro in einen Alternativl\u00fcfter investieren.Ich bin sehr zufrieden und die dritte Ryzen-Genaration d\u00fcrfte auch die Letzte sein, die auf meinem Board noch l\u00e4uft.",
