                "reviewText": "First off, I enjoy building SFF (small form factor) type builds.The current generation of CPU's were more power hungry, which resulted in more heat to dissipate. Trying to cool a Ryzen 9 7900X on a CPU cooler rated for max 100W is quite difficult, so therefore you have to go towards cases like the NZXT H1 V2.This particular chip allows you to not only have near identical performance to the Ryzen 9 7900X with PBO, but also gives you SFF allowable performance at a lower wattage that still provides you power.So far today using this has been great, and I recommend this chip to anyone that wants a newer generation chip without the abismal power draws that have been required as of late.Edit 1/17:From normal use I have seen no difference between this model and the X model. I had both chips in my NZXT H1 V2, liquid metal as the thermal application, and by far the non X model does much better in this type of SFF build. It still will boost, however if you are like me, work from home, and use this all day long in most cases, you aren't going to want the CPU blasting at full power over the entire work day.Quick note: temps are much better, my fan curve was not changed and the temperature is a lot more tolerable compared to the X version, so my CPU radiator fan does not spool up as much as it did with the X. I let it hover between 50C-65C for daily use and the fans are quiet, with the X the fan was at half or more RPM constantly to keep it at around this temperature and would sometimes hover in the 70's. So, if you are temperature concious then the non-x version is great.With that said I am pleased with the product. I do feel though this model needed to be priced at $399, as we have seen the 7900X is selling at this time around $425 on sale.Again, I will reiterate, the allowances in this chip should have been more prevalent in the X version, as I feel like we were kind of ripped off slightly this generation on CPU's and GPU's.Edit 1/20:This will be my final edit. I am boosting to around 5.5 MHz with the wattage anywhere from 60-90W. My temperatures are sustaining on load no more than 68C on a single 140mm AIO in the NZXT H1 V2. This is great, I am maintaining the frequency, but with a much lower power draw.One item I would recommend is getting an aftermarket chip mounting plate for this chip, weirdly it did make a difference for this chip, around 1-2C lower than the stock MOBO chip mount. I'm using the following mount: Thermalright ASF-Black AM5 CPU Holder, Corrective Anti-Bending Fixing Frame, AM5 Full-fit Fixed Non-Marking Mounter, AM5 Anti-Bending Contact Frame, CPU Cooler Standard, I am also using the following paste: Thermal Grizzly Conductonaut Thermal Grease - 1 Gram Set + 3 Applicators + Pads - Liquid Metal Thermal Paste for Cooling The CPU, GPU Value Pack.So far so good, would recommend, and again this is what the first chip should have been - AMD is trying too much to be intel, sure make your server chips, but we buy AMD for efficiency, not brute power in most cases. Sure, there is threadripper, but most of us are casual users. Regardless, this is the chip we all wanted, it's powerful, efficient, and over-clockable.",

                "reviewText": "Got it while the price was still at MSRP before it went up higher than the 7900X. Way better value than 7900X. This is due to the better efficiency, it\u2019s easier to cool. If you want more power and performance, just turn on PBO if your cooling can handle it. More than enough performance even without PBO to max out my games\u2019 FPS.Also the 7800X3D prices just came out and it starts at $449. 7900 still a better value imo but only if you can get one at $429 or less. Otherwise may as well just get 7800X3D if it stays at $450 but the problem with that is you\u2019ll be waiting for at least another 2 months and we don\u2019t know how it\u2019ll perform yet. 7900X3D and 7950X3D prices are in the sky and not worth it imo. You can already max out your games with a good GPU and a Ryzen 7 7700.",

                "reviewText": "With AMD's Ryzen Master software this CPU can OC to 5500mhz out of the box. I have this installed on a 650M motherboard with 128gb of DDR5 and a RTX 4070 card and it runs nice and cool in a 'mesh' style mATX case. Compared to my i7-10875H this CPU screams with half the heat produced. I am very impressed and glad I chose it over the 7900x or 7950x",

                "reviewText": "I don't know why they would put an IGPU on this chip, it hardly handles running just windows 11 at the desktop. The screen will flash black or get all glichy from time to time and it barely runs any game even at lowest settings. Thankfully I was just testing out the IGPU and had purchased a dedicated GPU for the build. AMD should get thier **** together, if I had purchased this for a sff integrated graphics build I would be livid. Aside from the horribleness that is the IGPU, this processor works well for my SFF build paired with a reference AMD 7900XT",
