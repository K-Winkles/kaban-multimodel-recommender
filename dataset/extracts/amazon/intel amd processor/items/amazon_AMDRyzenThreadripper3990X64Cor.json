I'm 65, a retired Aerospace Engineer and I still like to do a lot of CAD design and Rendering for my hobby now. This processor is INSANE Fast ! I have been using workstations in Aerospace for the last 40 years or so. Mostly high end, very expensive UNIX boxes. But I have never seen a processor the likes of this. Expensive? YES. But if you want the best in the world you pay the price. I can't believe anyone would ever be disappointed with the AMD Threadripper 3990x as the heart of their Workstation. This processor actually has an overclocking algorithm built in called \"Precision Boost Overdrive\" that lets you extend the boost clock to 4.5GHz. You just set it and forget it. I have never had a crash with PBO +200MHz enabled.",

However almost every \"shrink-wrapped\" user (not server) application out there is not designed to run on this level of hardware. I believe there are three type of apps where it justified: 1. Blender and similar apps, 2. Some server class applications (keep in mind that it is not a real server CPU, that is Epic, 3. The most important one - if you professionally develop software that will eat all available cores with almost linear scalability. That is my case, My algorithms need as many cores as possible, fastest random IO access to storage (read Intel Optane) and as much RAM as possible. The only downside for me is limitation of 256GB of RAM on 4 channels. Because of this I will probably switch to dual Epic system, If I can justify the cost.",

Where\u2019s the value? At that price per core this AMD would cost $6,755. If you want cheap the Ryzen 9 3950X is 16-core for $699.But, Intel also loves to skew the benchmarks and focus on any single obscure point in which Intel is better. The fan response is based on real world use when people realized the new AMD\u2019s absolutely destroy the Intel CPUs in real world and gaming performance, at $ for $. Sure an 18-core i9 might slightly beat a 16-core Ryzen, but not by double, which is the price difference. Even if an AMD core was half the performance of Intel this CPU would be worth the price. Intel high core count CPUs are over $100/core, go check, do the math. What\u2019s this 64-core??? Just over $50/core? Yes, it\u2019s expensive but it\u2019s 64 cores.... 16x the average Intel 4-core CPU, but not 16x the price.So, while everyone agrees that this is best in terms of performance I am here to say it\u2019s best in value, too. You just have sticker shock over the number of cores. But, go back down to 32-core then, it\u2019ll ease the blow at half the CPUs.",

                "reviewTitle": "Best CPU I have had - no need for overclocking!",
                "reviewText": "I am writing this review not to tell you how impressed I am by the fact that one can actually have 64 cores / 128 threads in one CPU die twice as cheap as the competition and do it gracefully, not overheating or anything like that (well, excuse my Kaby Lake that started overheating after running full load for a couple of days). I am writing to point out that one does not need to try to overclock the new generation AMD CPU's because modern motherboards compete by *safely* overclocking modern CPU's in their default mode, even in the energy saving 'ECO' mode that is!After installing my Ryzen Threadripper (3990x) I was certainly cautious whether the AIO cooling solution provided by the dedicated Corsair MasterLiquid ML360R special edition for 3990x would be adequate for this powerful CPU running at full load 24/7. So I was running test after test with different load patterns (16/32/64/96/128 threads) as well as different fan settings, with the aim of finding an elusive \"sweet spot\" for the 'just right cooling at minimal noise' from the fans.Eventually I also tried to overclock the CPU moderately (up to 3.6 GHz) and see how the CPU die temperature and the noise from all the fans (6 in total) would interplay. I should say, I was pretty much amazed at the result! It appeared that at default ECO settings the BIOS (i.e. the motherboard) acted like both a very efficient overclocking wizard (behind the scene; many people would not notice even) but also as a shield for the CPU not to overheat while still providing just the correct level of power for any particular load. To my big surprise(!), if I wanted to overclock manually by setting the CPU frequency precisely, I would definitely go into a dangerous regime of uncontrolled (over-) heating, albeit masked by the time it would require to manifest, depending on the frequency I opted for - the higher the frequency the shorter the time.Long story made short, If you try to overclock such a powerful CPU, beware that the BIOS will (unduly!) maintain precisely the preset frequency that you chose in the BIOS settings, no matter what - that is, irrespective of the actual load, i.e. in the idle state too! This is an easy way to unduly overheat and, by doing so, ware out the CPU beyond its actual capacity (like a battery that is never given a chance to properly recharge in full). On the contrary, if you leave it to the BIOS (motherboard) to decide on the overclocking regime depending on the actual load (by opting for the default settings), you will (a) prolong the CPU life (while staying under warranty!), (b) will be using exactly the power needed for the load at the time, (c) save some quid/dollar on your electricity bill as the wattage spent will be exactly proportional to the load your CPU (and PC) is using (i.e. the over- or under- clocking done by the motherboard). As an extra bonus, your ears (and perhaps the climate in your family) will be healthier! :)That's all I wanted share, based on my extensive tests for over two weeks of running this CPU under different loads and cooling. About the cooling regime, by the way, if you don't definitely overclock beyond what is necessary for your tasks (well, games for some), you will find that no special regime is required, just auto-tune your fans and maybe you will be able even to reduce the primary CPU (Corsair in my case) fans to run at lower speeds most of the time, unless the CPU die T goes over 70 C.",

Bisher hatte man die Wahl, wer Kerne brauchte musste AMD Kaufen, daf\u00fcr aber wo diese nicht z\u00e4hlten deutliche Abstriche machen, wer das nicht voll auskosten konnte war mit Intel besser aufgehoben, Mit Zen2 offensichtlich kein problem mehr...
