The i7 4770k was still capable, but honestly I wanted RCPS3 to run better because their getting closer to 75% of the library being playable. Also, I could tell my 8gb of g-skill sniper ram was holding me back and i could not for the life of me find 16gb of ram available that would run with trusted compatibility with my current board. The i9 12900kf hardly touches 20% usage for any new game and older games are even less usage while the video card sits at 99-100% usage, this is the sweet spot for no bottle necking and high performance.The video card is an RTX 2060 Super @ 1440P on Dell's 32\" monitor S3220DGF. With zero brightness and contrast at a hundred, the colors pop. I'd say comparable to OLED with those settings or at least IPS. The CPU is paired with the Z690 Strix motherboard and 32gb of Corsair vengeance ram. 32gb is the sweet spot. I watched a Linus Tech Tip video that said 8gb is good enough but when I run MSI afterburner along with Riva Tuner-statistics , the ram usage is usually between 10 and 12gb's used and sometimes as high as 14gb, with no known programs of mine running in the background. Perhaps we definitely passed the 8gb minimum by now. Itunes, Video Proc Converter, RPCS3, and Virtual DJ are some of my most demanding apps and this cpu just handles them like it's lite work I'm throwing at it. Well, there's the value. Highly recommending this chip but if you do go for it, be sure to pick up the Thermalright CPU Contact Frame for LGA 1700 Retrofit Kit or else, your cpu will burn, literally, that\u2019s the only caveat to the 12th generation.",
