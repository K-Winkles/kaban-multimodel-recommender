                "reviewText": "Just installed my i7-10700 in a Gigabyte Z490 Aorus Elite and paired with 32GB Corsair Vengeance LPX (2666) with zero issues. Great performance bump over my previous i7-6700, running at similar temps as well. Idles around 28-32C and HeavyLoad stress test bumps it up to 66-68C using a BeQuiet Pure Rock Slim, Arctic Cooling MX-4, and the motherboard's \"silent\" fan curve for the CPU.If you're a stock cooler user that still cares about aesthetics, good news! The stock cooler with the i7-10700 is blacked out, has a sleeved fan cable, and has a copper slug.At the moment, the other reviews imply that they got a tampered product. That may very well be since I can't actually hold their product and verify for myself, but I'll offer an alternative view on this-- The sticker on my box looked exactly like these others' pictures, and I'm 100% sure it was not physically tampered with upon close inspection. In fact, this sticker does NOT even appear to be the multi-layer type of tamper-evident stickers. When I tried to peel the sticker in various ways, all it ever did was tear the underlying paper/cardboard along with it. It seems like this was merely a case of the \"factory sealed\" lettering not being uniformly printed onto the sticker, or possibly even rubbed off of the exterior, and nothing more. (A gentle fingernail scrape wiped away the letters easily for me)",

                "reviewText": "Many reviews mention they received a tampered with box. The Made in Vietnam version of this cpu arrives in a box that has it's tamper seal printed backwards -- meaning the paint that is supposed to come off when you rip open the seal is printed on the outside of the seal, so the paint wears out from rubbing against other boxes in shipment and against shipping material, which makes it appear that the box was opened. It however was not and the cpu is brand new. I purchase multiple Intel chips and I noticed this right away after reading the reviews and receiving my cpu with a rubbed out seal too -- if you use your nail you can see that the paint will come right off -- however if you open the seal it will not stay on the box since it is printed on the outside of the seal. Hence, the CPUs are not tampered with, just an issue with how they created those seals. As to the misalignment of the cpu in the box -- this is something that almost always happens in Intel cpus and is not something to be wary of. The CPU i received performs top notch on a z490 motherboard, with 4889 R20 score.",

                "reviewText": "I think this processor is the unsung hero of the entire 10th gen product launch. It has a slightly lower TDP, so it is not a furnace in the case like some of the other 10th gen processors (I'm using a dual tower air cooler without issues). With a little bios adjustment and a Z series motherboard, you can adjust the BCLK slightly higher and extend the turbo boosting to get 97% of a regular unlocked \"K\" CPU at a significantly lower price. I use it with DDR4 3600 memory, and I'd be hard pressed to notice a difference between my old 9900k and this CPU in regular usage.If you want to spend an extra $100-200 for that last 3-5% of performance that you'd get out of an unlocked 10700k or 10900k, so be it, but this is a good alternative for the budget conscious Intel fan looking for higher end performance.",

                "reviewText": "I decided to base my new DAW on this processor and I'm glad I did. Using Cubase 10.5 I am only seeing about 25% of the processor being used at any given time. I don't intend to use this computer for anything else but it is imperative that it be quiet.I used the Intel supplied cooler for a couple of days but in benchmarking the processor got up to 100C (212F!). That's crazy hot. That was WITH thermal throttling.I replaced the wimpy cooler with a 150W TDP one. Telling BIOS that you installed a tower cooler (automatically) raises the TDP to 125W. No more throttling and never gets above 60C. (Pretty amazing for a $25 cooler I think.). The fan is inaudible from a foot away.Rendering my projects now takes mere seconds rather than minutes. I like that. But my basic reason for building a new computer was reliability. I was using a 10 year old HP desktop.",

                "reviewText": "Listen I was desperate enough to buy this CPU at a 40 dollar markup because everything else was sold out, I hate greedy businesses. That being said, I'm in love with it. Great cpu for gaming paired it with a z490 asus prime A, and a 2080 super! I'm flying. Most coolers that worked with previous gen will work with this 10th gen.My product was sold by a 3rd party via Amazon, I checked the box and everything was factory sealed and delivered perfectly. The 40 bucks extra i spent... i guess.",
