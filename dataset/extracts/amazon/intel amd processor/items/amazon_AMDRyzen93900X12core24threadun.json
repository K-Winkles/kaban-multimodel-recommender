                "reviewText": "upgraded from my Ryzen 7 to this Ryzen 9 3900X for gaming cache. First off its insanely snappy. Will run a bit hot even with liquid cooling. If you buy this get liquid cooling. So right out of the gate my RTX 2700 Super Founders Edition had insane eye candy and much better speed. Anything you through at it will open at break neck speeds. Your mouse will be your enemy. It will move entirely way too fast due to its processing power. This thing mops the floor with all the Intel Chips ive ever owned. Even my I9 chips dont game or compute as this chip does. Its a must have if you want to play video games and do insane amounts of processing. It operates on all buses on your system board quite efficiently. Ive been debating messing with my memory timing as I have AMD Ryzen Memory Ready RAM which automagically times with the system clock of the CPU and AMD Ready Ram will run at 3600 MHz. You must set your XMP/DOCP option in the BIOS. But Ryzen makes efficient use of PCIE 4.0 and its fast. You wont be disappointed other than it will push some heat but running any gaming on a 70 MEGS of video cache dedicated to video rendering makes this a seriously badd chip for anything you want to do. Its smoking intel and I have been an Intel Fan for so many years until this thing fell into my hands. All I do for a living is work on PCs Desktops Servers, and Land based internet I go home to this and appreciate all it does. It will not disappoint and will stay strong for years. This absolutely buries Intel. Worth every penny I put towards it. Now my Ryzen 7 2700 will sit in its plastic case. Trust me I had to do it. When I play Ghost Recon with my son it looks as though he is Sprinting it renders frames so fast. The game runs so quick with playing with other gamers your mouse will piss you off you will have to lock the frame rates on your mouse and they move so fast on your screen its simply amazing. Eye candy with games coupled with a NVIDIA RTX you will be amazed. Okay not a fanboy of Ryzen but I love this chip. See how it holds up and I am a verified user.",

Set Amazon to notify me when available. Got the message hit the 1-click-puchase button faster than I ever have. The item was purchased 7/8/19 and shipped Tuesday 7/10. I received the CPU safe and well packaged on Friday 7/12, a day earlier than Amazon quoted at time of shipment.After updating the BIOS, and running a few final benchmarks on my Asrock x370 Taichi motherboard, I shut down the system and removed my 1800x (this CPU will go into my daily driver system and relieve my r5 1600 CPU slated to be installed in Mom's PC). Warning! Make sure to move the AIO fan wire out of the way of the CPU die and the cooler surface. I had a boot loop and overheating/shutdown session. Was able to get into the BIOS and see the CPU temp at 101c Wow! LOL no wonder it was shutting off. Anyway after seeing my stupid mistake, and re-seating the AIO cooler, the next boot-up took forever and 10 minutes to boot into Windows. Once Windows recognized the CPU and it was running, I started running some benchmarks.Now, I'm not a gamer, so again I am comparing my work load of video editing and production as well as rendering. With one commercial project alone, I my render time has dropped from around 20 minutes to 12 minutes... that's 40% improvement. I can render some commercial projects up to 4 times per work session. I've been very happy with the performance so far, but I'm absolutely blown away by this processor's ability. Rendering a 1 hour 1080p video usually takes an 1h 10m or so. I re-rendered last week's video and that time dropped down to around 42 minutes. My productivity is going to go through the roof.Spending $500 on one single item that is smaller than the palm of your hand can be mind-blowing for some people. It may also cause some heartache and possibly buyers remorse for others. Here's the deal, when you consider purchasing this CPU, you must do some research. Know exactly what you will be doing with your system to insure the performance gain is there. If you are a gamer, this CPU will play every game very very well. While it never claims to be the best in gaming, it is definitely meant for heavy work loads. What an outstanding and simple upgrade for a system that will provide another 4 years of great productivity.As a side note, I have been eyeing up an AMD Threadripper build for the past 9 months. My work requires high core and thread counts which enable the jobs to render much faster. I had already saved my money to invest into the 2950x and was still saving for the motherboard. Considering the fact that I earn a living with my PC, a professional workstation is in order. While it's exciting to order a new \"toy\", I hope you plan for something like this. It makes your purchase even sweeter when you \"just know\" you got a great product for a reasonable price, and it will do what you need it to do. Also, looks like I need to update the name of my system now LOL. It's not an 1800x any longer.Cheers!",

                "reviewText": "In a word? IT'S A MAD BEAST. I have wanted something that could handle 4k and 8k video (codecs really play a part as all are not handled the same here). If you work with adobe products and you want a smoother performance then this CPU is for you and I never even see it go over 20% usage even when rendering. It's so good. As newer CPU's come out, this will be cheaper and will even be better value for money. Its mops the floor with its intel equivalent.Pros:* its fast, is beefy and its gonna chew through most of what you are struggling with now. A great balance for gaming and productivity.* Comes with a cooler (honestly it is the best looking stock cooler you will ever own) which manages to keep it tamed, just make sure to buy a case with high airflow. I dont recommend the NZXT cases because they dont have good front airflow.* Cooler comes with pre-installed thermal paste which is brilliant and it is very easy to install. (Look at the X570 motherboards for this CPU)Cons:* It gets hot. Oh it bakes very quickly so you will have to either buy an after market cooler or AIO to keep it cool over long periods of time if overclocking. Otherwise it's fine with the stock coolerVery impressed with the R9 3900x so far. I will be good for the next couple.of years for sure.",

Debo decir que si, si ustedes buscan reviews en Internet, el nuevo ryzen 7 5700x le da vuelta a este procesador en juegos por el mismo precio, pero en productividad esos n\u00facleos extra siguen d\u00e1ndole una ventaja interesante tanto con el ryzen 7 as\u00ed como contra intel y lo que pudiera ofrecer (para productividad) por lo que debo decirles que a\u00fan en 2021 es una excelente alternativa este modelo (y no sus hermanos mayores de la serie 3000) tanto por el precio como por el hecho que su dicipador de stock es perfecto para mantenerlo fresco sin problema alguno, es un procesador maravilloso para trabajar y para el gaming se defiende a\u00fan sin problema alguno. Quiz\u00e1s si hubiera una queja seria la poca pasta t\u00e9rmica que trae de stock, pero nada que al cabo de 1 a\u00f1o o 2 puedas cambiar por una de mejor calidad. Como dato adicional ese cooler que trae va perfecto para poner todas las rams sin problemas siempre que no sean exageradamente altas, aunque bueno, si le vas a acompa\u00f1ar con rams con dicipadores altos (por ende rams costosas) invertir en un enfriamiento l\u00edquido no suena a mala idea.",

                "reviewText": "I learned something with this processor : at 7nm lithography, there is not enough surface area on the CPU die to properly cool it and cooling has become the primary issue with increasing density.I spent the previous eight years on an eight core(?) FX-8350 and even then, heat vs density was a problem, and that chip would just reset when too hot, which happened to me many times on two different 8350 systems. The reset issue was fixed with the biggest air cooled CPU cooler available and my FX-8350 systems ran smoothly 24/7 under full load. The temperatures were also stable, starting at 30c and slowly ramping up to maybe 50-60c under load.Holy crap is the 3900x a different beast : it drops its own voltage and clock speeds when it gets too hot, and even with the biggest air cooled CPU cooler available, under load it averages 88c(!), which is only 7 degrees shy of the 95c thermal limit. It is also incredibly spiky, jumping between 45c to 60c in seconds at idle. (Yes my thermal paste is applied correctly and the case has nine fans, five of which are 140mm. I have been building computers for friends and myself for two decades. ). I have noted others have better temps on an air cooled system, but that just speaks to quality variability.I was going to give it four stars but the cooling problem is systemic, not an inherent design flaw. If they are going to fix it they need to double the size of the CPU die in order to give it enough surface area to get all the heat off quickly enough. Water cooling makes no difference if the heat bottleneck is the topside surface area of the chip.If you plan on doing long duration full work loads, which are multiple simultaneous EM simulations in my case, the included stock cooler is entirely inadequate. Even short duration full loads with the stock cooler means sitting next to a cooling system running full blast and a chip so hot, it dials its performance back to keep it from prematurely killing itself.It is damn fast and my multiple virtual machines have never been so snappy. I had to reset what I thought was a \u201csafe temperature\u201d for a CPU though. Some irony that this is the most I have ever paid for a processor.[April 2022] Still going strong - I tend to put it into low power mode which parks half the processors when working and change it back to \u201cbalanced\u201d when doing anything more that needs a kick in the pants. It hasn\u2019t hard reset because of heat unlike the previous FX8350.",

Sebbene abbia aspettato l'uscita dei nuovi Ryzen 9 5900x, la loro mancata reperibilit\u00e0 nel mercato (se non a prezzi elevatissimi) mi ha fatto valutare seriamente il Ryzen 9 3900x, e devo dire che, complice una buona offerta, non mi pento minimamente di questa scelta.Leggendo sul web, tra forum, reddit e recensioni, sono tutti talmente entusiasti delle prestazioni in single-thread della nuova serie Ryzen 5000 da trasmettere la sensazione che la serie 3000 (e nella fattispecie il 3900x) andasse male o comunque non fosse performante, che insomma fosse lento nel single-thread. Avendo una cpu (l'i7-2600k) che invece \u00e8 sempre andata molto forte nel single-thread, non riuscivo bene a capire se, in caso di applicazioni fortemente single-threaded (come alcune funzioni di Photoshop) avessi notato differenze sostanziali o se potessi rimanere \"fregato\" in questo ambito.Ebbene, la differenza \u00e8 *ABISSALE* in single-thread, mentre \u00e8 come trovarsi in un universo parallelo quando si usano applicazioni multi-threaded, come ad esempio Handbrake, Starxrip o Premiere Pro, nell'ambito dell'editing ed encoding video.Un esempio: l'esportazione di uno specifico video su Premiere Pro \u00e8 passato da 12m40s a 2m26s.Ero scioccato.Non soltanto: se si abilita l'accelerazione hardware nvenc delle schede nVidia che la supportano (nel mio caso ho una GTX 1070 OC 8GB) l'utilizzo della GPU in fase di encoding passa dal 20% (con il 100% di cpu) dell'i7-2600k al 90% con il 10% della cpu del Ryzen 9 3900x.In gaming il paragone \u00e8 altrettanto impietoso, ho guadagnato almeno il 120-140% di prestazioni in modalit\u00e0 multiplayer di come Battlefield V e GTA V: nel primo, soprattutto, son passato da una media di 30-35 fps ad una di 80-85 fps. L'i7-2600k non riusciva pi\u00f9 a gestire bene le modalit\u00e0 multiplayer di tutti i giochi che graficamente gi\u00e0 impegnavano molto la CPU e la GPU.Insomma, soddisfatto? No, soddisfattissimo!Un consiglio spassionato per\u00f2: investite in un buon dissipatore e in un buon case, poich\u00e9 \u00e8 un processore che riscalda molto. Io ho preso un dissipatore ad aria Be Quiet! Dark Rock Pro 4 e un case Be Quiet! Pure Base 600 e mi trovo ad avere temperature a 35\u00b0C in idle e 55-58\u00b0C in full, il tutto in assoluto silenzio. Usando il dissipatore stock e/o un base con un pessimo airflow, il rischio di toccare 80-85\u00b0C e di mettere sotto stress la cpu \u00e8 concreto.",
