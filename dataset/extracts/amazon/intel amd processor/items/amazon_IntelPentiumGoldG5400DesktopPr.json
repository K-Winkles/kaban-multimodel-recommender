                "reviewText": "Everyone knows that Intel's Pentium Gold and Celeron chips are just rebinned variants of their more expensive products. In other words, this is just a Coffee Lake Core i3/i5/i7 with bad cores and cache sized down to a Dual Core CPU with hyper threading.In other words, don't expect this to be on par with any of their other offerings of the same generation. That being said, I'll be the first to admit that underlying microarchitecture is the same as their other chips so you'll see solid performance under moderate workloads. It wont be top tier but it will do the job.How do I use this CPU? In an ESXi host, and it does quite well! I'm running four to five virtual machines and a time and it has no problem staying responsive and cool.",

I did overclock my memory some but that only barely helped.I could only suggest this CPU for a PC that is going to act as a device and is not a daily driver. It would probably be ok for a htpc, a mining rig, or a data collector for sensors or security video. Otherwise there are much better choices out there. Break the piggie bank and get a low end I3 or I5 instead.",
