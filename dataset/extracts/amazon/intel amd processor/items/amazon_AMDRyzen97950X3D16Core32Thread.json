I got this on sale for only $10 more than the 7900 and it was very much worth it! AMD has managed to make this thing deliver at a remarkably low 95W TDP as well - quite remarkable. Happily your socket AM4 cooler with fit on your new motherboard, although in my case it required a trip to the hardware store to buy 4 metric bolts (the backplate is now integral, and for some coolers, like my TT waterblock, you have to screw into the backplate directly).Did you pick up on the \"new motherboard\" comment? You're going to need one - AMD has moved to LGA rather than PGA for their new chips and socket AM5, and they only support DDR5 as well, so you're going to need some new RAM - BUT if you don't cheap out, buy a high-end board and EXPO certified RAM and get ready to launch moon rockets, or anything else your heart desires, with a very very fast system.",

                "reviewText": "Running this chip with a DeepCool LT720 360mm rad with an ElecGear Carbon fiber contact frame with kingpin KPX thermal compound. In a lighter gaming workload, I didn't see temps get above 55C on the hottest sensor from hwinfo in the recommended config from AMD. I don't think high temperatures will be a problem for this particular chip, at least not outside what the rest of the 7000 series family can hit.I personally haven't had any stability concerns with this processor in the 3 weeks that I have ran it in place of my 7700x, even with EXPO enabled. In terms of average framerate, this chip feels like a 7700x subjectively, as I have no issues getting frames to a 4090 that I can tell. The 3d cache helps with 1%/.1% lows, to the point that the majority of the micro stutters I had gotten from my 7700x are largely gone in gameplay. There may be a small stutter when swapping from a game to a non game on another screen if using AMD's recommended config, but not enough to be a bother.Overall, if you want to mess around with extra cores later on (streaming, encode, etc.) but want the 3dcache for games now AND your budget allows for it, the 7950X3D is a pretty solid pick in my book for the enthusiast who wants the best without heading into server CPU territory.PC specs relevant to review:Asus ROG Crosshair x670E Extreme (with ElecGear contact frame, BIOS 1415)Gskill Trident Z5 Neo 32gb ddr5 6000 CL30 (EXPO)DeepCool Lt720 360mm radiatior (stock fans with unit, KPX compound)Gigabyte RTX 4090 gaming OC",

                "reviewText": "(bought 8 mos ago via Amazon) I'm a hardware/software guy, and I've been building my own rigs since 1996. For CPUs, my price point tends to be ~$630 or so (in the day, that got me a p2 400mhz). This is A LOT of cpu for the money. This thing will chew through a database, photoshoop AI process, an unzipping of huge files, and MS flightsim and Cyberpunk with ease and efficiency (have you checked the low wattage on this thing?). I do recommend an extended board, notated by the \"E\" at the end of the name. The MSI board is my only regret. Get a premium board to match this premium cpu.I am doing overkill w/ the Corsair 420 AIO, but I've read other reviews that say this thing can be air-cooled. YMMV.Good luck with your builds my guys. Have fun and happy new year!",
