I wanted a better CPU without having to upgrade the MOBO and get faster, better performance without bottlenecking. This does the job.I have it paired with an MSI 460G Mobo and a Nvidia RTX 2060 super and the performance is much better. CPU is running at 60-70 C maxed out (which is well within spec), so I am going to add a liquid cooled fan to bring that down, but even at the 60-70 there's no lag.If you're looking to make an upgrade to your 10th gen system without having to get a new Mobo, this is a great option",

Gamer Nexus showed this CPU beating out a i9 in Gaming with proper RAM and CPU Overclocking, and the results are repeatable because I've tested this myself and found this CPU to be a little monster for Gaming performance. We all know the i5-9600K was the best Gaming CPU for the longest time and the i5-10600K is basically just a i5-9600K 2.0 that's been revised and improved.At the $230 price tag I would highly suggest this CPU to anyone who wants to stick with Intel and running on the LGA1200 socket. (Please keep in mind that my results are on a water cooled AIO setup so please don't expect the same results)PC Setup:Case: Corsair 4000D Air FlowMOB: ASUS Rog Z490 E (DO NOT SUGGEST THIS BOARD OR COMPANY!!)CPU: i5-10600KRAM: Corsair Vengeance Pro RGB 3200Mhz (16gb Kit)AIO: Fractal Prisma S24 AIO 240mmGPU: EVGA FTW2 1070TiPSU: Seasonic GX750 Gold 750wSSD: Samsung EVO 840 (1TB) WD Blue (500gb)This has been a very strong setup for the money so far, so feel free to copy of it what you want.I just wouldn't use the ASUS Z490E \"It arrived broken and ASUS refused to help me at all, so I ended up having to solder and Super Glue on a $300 board to fix the damage from the factory\"",

I use MSI's XMP (all the time) and CPU Boost (some of the time). Very stable, and not excessively hot. I combine this setup with Corsair Vengeance LPX 32GB DDR4 3600 (PC4-28800) C18 1.35V desktop memory and a tower cooler. Check the fitting of the tower cooler before you buy. I had to go back and get a Noctua NH-D15S to have enough room for memory clearance. Modern gaming motherboards don't allow room for much besides a very carefully-designed tower cooler.",
