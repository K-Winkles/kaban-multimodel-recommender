                "reviewText": "I'm using the stock Intel cooler that came with my 12700 and the highest I hit in games is about 79c, most of the time is stays in the low 70s. Idle temps stay in the 30s. That's with the cpu wattage unlocked and raising the pl1 and pl2 settings a bit in the bios and a single intake and single exhaust fan in a mid size case. I learned a long time ago that ambient room temp and fan curves are very important. You want to exhaust as much hot air as you can out of the case as fast as possible. You can mount a skyscraper to your CPU and have 12 case fans, if your room temp is high and you don't set proper fan curves, you'll still run hot. I don't care about cinebench or other benchmarks, most games people play and apps people use on a daily basis will never stress the CPU anywhere near what a benchmark will. If you do a lot of heavy video editing and conversion work and raise your wattage limits way up then yes go for a higher end cooling solution .Edit: I've since installed an Intel RH1 cooler (the one that comes with the i9) on this chip and it dropped my temps by an average of about 8c. I know I can buy a third party cooler but I don't want a huge cpu cooler in my case and I don't want to play with brackets that may not fit 100% correctly. You can find new RH1 coolers on ebay for pretty cheap.",

Los resultados de los benchmark fueron muy altos y la temperatura muy bien gestionada. Estoy contento con este i7 12700... Trabajo con Edici\u00f3n de video profesional.The truth is I did NOT have high expectations because the base frequency seemed very low (@2.1 ghz), however doing some performance tests, the cores quickly went up to 4.3 ghz without much apparent effort, the benchmark results were very high and temperature very well managed.

I had a hard time fitting the stock fan on the motherboard, the pins would not go in easily so I had to remove it a few times I'm wondering if that affected the thermal paste so I might add some more and try again.",
