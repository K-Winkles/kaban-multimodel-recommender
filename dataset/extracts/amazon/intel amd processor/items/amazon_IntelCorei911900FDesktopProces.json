Now that isn't to say this i9 is not a great CPU because it is! Nice and powerful for a non k variant, even on par with the previous 10900k (according to userbenchmark) Now being a 65watt CPU don't expect it to be kept cool with a typical 65watt rated cooler Id recommend it be paired with at least an air cooler with a minimum of 6 heat pipes like the Noctua NH-U12S, or a liquid cooler. (I am running the NH-U12S and even under high load it is whisper quiet). So far though I love it. Mine is pair with a RTX 2060 Super and together they make for a great gaming pair.",
