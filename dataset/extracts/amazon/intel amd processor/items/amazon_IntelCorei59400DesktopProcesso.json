Although I can't wait to try a ryzen processor, I have a feeling that Intel is going to stick around for the future of processors, given the fact how incredibly efficiency they are, even though they are on the 14nm node.

                "reviewText": "The pc that I upgraded this to originally had a core i3. This was a great improvement for that particular pc. It was one of few options that was compatible with the motherboard on that PC. This core i5 is capable of doing \"some\" things. Light/medium music editing, light/medium video editing, \"Some\" games, depending on if you use the stock graphics or a separate graphics card) and of course your browsing and surfing. You're likely to purchase this if you bought a stock branded PC (hp, acer etc) from a retailer and you needed to upgrade to do a tad bit more functionality. So you will get an improvement but keep in mind that this is a 9th generation device. The current gen is 13. I personally wouldn't recommend this on a custom pc build or something that requires a lot of speed. There are better similarly priced options and better motherboards that support those options. One last thing that really bothered me with this core i5 is that the fan is extremely loud and it revs up randomly. The fan also doesn't have screws, it has those punch things which can be a bit finicky. If you can replace the fan with an inexpensive low noise version do so.",

I have used AMD and they are good too, but I believe Intel is superior definitely. All a matter of personal opinion I know, but I have sure had great luck with Intel processors. I bought the 9400. Good price and is definitely \"Snappier\" then i thought it would be. Performs well. Will clearly recommend.",

I was looking for something decently powerful to handle Plex transcoding yet something easily cooled in an airflow constrained case. My server has 8 hard drives in a hot-swap array which generate a decent amount of heat. I paired this CPU with a Noctua NH-L9i low-profile cooler and this keeps the CPU around 40-55C during normal operations. This CPU has been basically plug and play, not requiring any additional tweaks and has been running 24x7 in my server since installation.",

                "reviewText": "Performance is great for what I paid. Works straight out of the box. No compatibility issues to speak of. Great for a reasonably priced gaming machine. Pairs nicely with a GTX 1660 Super, GTX 1660 Ti, GTX 1070, GTX 980 Ti or AMD RX 5600XT. You can pair it with a less powerful GPU, such as the AMD RX 570 or 480/580/590 or perhaps a GTX 1650 Super but you'll be heavily GPU bound and you might as well just buy an i3-9100/9100F if you cannot afford to upgrade GPUs in the near future- and with the current state of affairs I can't say I blame you. No need to spend extra on super fast RAM either- with Intel CPUs the performance gain is very small and if you're on a budget you're probably not buying a Z390 motherboard, either. It doesn't make sense to put a locked chip in a Z390 board.",

It will give you plenty of machine usefulness (longevity) at a great price. 6 cores mean you get great processing power when you need it, but at idle power usage is very good. If you are building a PC for gaming you are probably going to want the next model up at least but it depends on the game",
