                "reviewText": "I got this to pair up with a 7900 XTX for 4K gaming. This is a fantastic CPU, however there are a few things to know. I did pair this with 6000 CL36 RAM and a MSI B650 Tomahawk board. It ran EXPO with no issues, however the processor was running at a higher clock than factory and was causing some stability issues. To fix this issue I ran the CPU at a negative .15 offset. This brought stability to the system and also increased performance in games and in cinabench R23. Also to note this is a chip that runs hot, but that it is designed to run hot by AMD. To keep it cool I ran a EK 360 AIO and set the package temperature limit to 85 degrees. Even with the negative .15 offset and 85 degrees limit this chip benchmarked higher that most review I have seen for the 7600X. I did attempt a undervolt with PBO and it would not accept any, however with the setting I have previously mentioned this chip ran cool with awesome performance, still exceeding the factory 5.3 boost speeds. After settings were in place it was running games at 50-60c, with no bottlenecks on the 79000XTX at 1440p or 4K. Overall I am very pleased with my choice to get the 7600X as I only use it for gaming and no productivity. For anyone that is wanting a fast gaming CPU, this one will accomplish that at a very good price!",

                "reviewText": "I have absolutely zero complaints about this processor. I originally had a 7700X, but I decided to sell it and get the 7600X in its place- that was a perfect decision. The 7600X is an absolute powerhouse. While you do lose a couple of cores, and may lose some productivity performance in terms of video editing and graphic design, there is barely a difference when it comes to games.In the games I tested, such as Cyberpunk, GTA V, RDR2, and Borderlands 3, I averaged only about a 2-4 FPS difference compared to when I was using the 7700X. It also helps extensively with cooling, as this only has a TDP of 65W at its best efficiency compared to the 7700X's 105W. However, despite the lower TDP, the 7600X can still get fairly hot, as I still found that my AIO wouldn't stop it from still reaching the lower 80's in more demanding titles.One major thing to note about the 7600X (or all AM5 processors in general) is that due to the new heat spreader design, you will need to make sure that you use a compatible cooler that uses a mounting system that will still apply adequate pressure, and also to be careful if you ever need to remove the CPU as it is harder to grip it by the sides. It's also very easy for thermal paste to fall into the grooves of the new IHS, but this won't be an issue as long as you steer clear of metal-based thermal solutions (unless you know what you're doing.)Overall, the Ryzen 5 7600X is the best value bargain deal in terms of ALL CPUs on the market right now- regardless if you prefer AMD or Intel. There is simply no CPU with as much performance, versatility, and general range of use in terms of its cost. Additionally, the periodic sales make it even more of a value deal, and I would definitely suggest getting the 7600X over all the other options if all you primarily do is streaming, gaming, or general use. I highly recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "Although you will have to upgrade your whole system to AM5, even the lower-end 7600x has WILD performance gains. You can do pretty much anything with this thing. Running a 100+ mod minecraft server with 10+ concurrent players all in different chunks? This thing doesn't even flinch. It does run quite hot, with the the MSI MAG 240R AIO, in a corsair 4000d airflow case, it peaks at around 86 C under cpu-z stress test.but the boost clocks are insane! 5.25 GHz without any touching any OC settings. This CPU is well worth it.",
