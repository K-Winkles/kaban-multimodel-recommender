And you'll be able to experience next-generation games without frame-rate hiccups and slowdowns. New Technologies Boost Performance The Intel Core i5-750 processor also makes use of some other cutting-edge technologies: Turbo Boost Technology allows the processor to run up to 133 MHz faster when it's operating below power/thermal limits. Smart Cache Memory increases available RAM resources, leading to less lag while multi-tasking. Unlike the Intel Core i7 processor line, the Intel Core i5-750 processor does not feature Hyper-threading capability, so it will perform slightly worse when dealing with multi-threaded programs. Still, the Core i5-750 processor compares favorably with Core i7 processors in nearly all other respects. Media Editing and Gaming Faster than Ever Whether editing high-definition videos, touching up family photos, or splicing up music, the Intel Core i5-750 processor will provide the processing power needed. The processor's four cores are optimized to keep up with the most advanced digital editing software. Compared to the previous generation of Intel Core2 processors, the Intel Core i5-750 processor can process HD video almost twice as fast. It also accelerates DVD encoding and compression, allowing you to easily share your HD home videos with everyone. The Intel Core i5-750 processor is also designed to handle the intense calculations and graphical rendering behind today's latest games. It has the ability to process thousands of graphical characteristics at once, resulting in a smooth and lag-free experience. The Intel Core i5-750 processor is backed by a three-year limited warranty.",

I got it in Trinidad 2 days later. I ordered it the same time with other parts for the computer but they all shipped the day after. The i5 came alone with a weight of 1.20lbs.I run Windows 7 64 bit and it never chokes with any apps or games and I have not overclocked it yet. If you want a serious gaming system do not spend more on the CPU than this, put the money towards a better graphics card or better SSD. The turbo boost works flawlessly to throttle the CPU instantaneously as necessary. Using the stock cooler I get around 40 degrees celcius when on the net or office apps and depending on how aggressively I set the fan speeds at most it reaches 60 degrees celcius during the day while gaming NFS Shift, Modern Warfare 2, World at War. The CPU never chokes on HD resolutions, AA 2x or 4x on for gaming. The bottle neck for me I think is the GPU and hard drive. Videos run smoothly, there are no freezes or crashes. If I decide to overclock then I will upgrade the stock cooler, the intel stock one is more than adequate for now. It's been a few weeks now with no problems and I am very happy with the build. The pc is not in an air conditioned room so with a/c air you can expect to get slightly lower temps. The temp in the room probably reaches around 30 degrees at peak.This CPU is amazing value for money, I predict this PC will last me well into the future, and when games get even more intense I can go xfire and get a SSD.System specs:Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit Intel Core i5 750 Processor 2.66 GHz 8 MB LGA1156 CPU I5-750BOX (quad core, turbo boost) Corsair CMX4GX3M2A1600C9 XMS3 4 GB PC3-12800 Core i5 Memory Kit (1600mhz) XFX Radeon HD 5770 1GB DDR5 PCIE Graphics Card HD577AZNFC (1gb, DX 11) Gigabyte Intel Core i7/ Core i5/ Core i3/ LGA 1156/ Intel H57/ 4DDR3-2200+/ATI CrossFireX/ HDMI/ USB3.0/ Raid Micro ATX Motherboard GA-H57M-USB3 (usb3, 7.1 audio, xfire, raid) Western Digital Caviar Black 1 TB Bulk/OEM Hard Drive 3.5 Inch, 32 MB Cache, 7200 RPM SATA II WD1001FALS OCZ OCZ600MXSP ModXStream Pro 600 Watt Power Supply (ATX12v 2.2, modular cables, 80+)Thermaltake VI1000NWS M9 case (2 x 120mm fan, toolless)IDE dvd burner Logitech MX 518 High Performance Optical Gaming Mouse (Metal) Dell S2209w 22\" LCD (5ms, 1080p, DVI-D)Logitech x530 speakers (5.1, 70w rms)MS KeyboardSony MDR-XD200 headphones500VA UPSWindows Experience Index Ratings (max is 7.9):Processor: 7.3Memory: 7.7Graphics: 7.4Gaming graphics: 7.4Primary disk: 5.9",

                "reviewText": "If you are reading this you know the Core i5 and Core i7 are the best CPUs currently made (as of March 2010). I was split between the Core i5-750 and the Core i7-960. It comes down to Hyperthreading, which the Core i5-750 does not have. To me, it's not worth the $80 price difference as the performance improvement is inconsistent and amounts to nothing for gaming.The i5-750 overclocks great. With no effort and only a cooler-master CPU cooler I'm up to 3.7 Ghz. This is pretty mild overclock as this CPU has been know to hit 4.0-4.1 on air. You just can't beat this processor for the price.Needless to say, my new system is very fast. I went with the following Combo for value and performance. Not cheap, but can run any game I have maxed out and I won't need to replace anything for about 3-years.Gigabyte P55M-UD2Core i5-750ATI Radeon 5850 Graphics cardSamsung Spinpoint F3 1TB driveSony Optiwrite DVD burnerCorsair XMS3 4Gb RAMCorsair TX650 power supplyCooler Master CPU coolerCooler Master Case",

                "reviewText": "I've been building PCs for our family since the early nineties and I'm pretty familiar with today's hardware, and the typical innovation rates over time. I used this processor to upgrade a two-year old Intel Core 2 Duo E4500 2.2 GHz 2M L2 Chace 800MHz FSB LGA775 Dual-Core Processor . The E4500 was relatively fast at running Vista and Windows 7x64 but I needed more processing power for burning AVCHD images. The i5 definitely delivers faster video editing performance, but I was a bit disappointed at the general Windows 7 performance. I'd say that boot time and normal operations, like opening applications, shutting down, viewing multimedia content, etc., was only slightly faster than the E4500. This processor was put together with an ASUS LGA1156 Intel P55 DDR3 - 2133 ATX Motherboard P7P55D Deluxe motherboard, and 8GBs of very low latency Patriot DDR3 PC3 12800 memory. The i5 is economical and extremely reliable, but simply didn't deliver the performance boost I was expecting, especially considering the chip-set architecture improvements of the LGA1156 platform. I don't play games, so perhaps the improvements would be more noticeable there. The processor rates as 6.9 in the Windows 7 Experience Index.Pros:- Cheap, compared to faster i7 and i8 processorsCons:- LGA1156 heatsink pins are slightly differently spaced than LGA775 pins- Very few LGA1156 coolers on the market (as of Nov-09)- Stock cooler/fan was a bit noisy, more so than the stock LGA775 fansWould I purchase this again? No, I'd spend more money and buy the Intel Core i7 Processor 2.80 GHz 8 MB LGA1156 CPU I7-860BOX 1/27/2010 Update:I've been using this processor for several months now, and I'm happy to report that there are more benefits to moving from a Core 2 Duo than I originally appreciated. Most importantly, encoding AVCHD discs using Sony's Picture Motion Browser (PMB) software package is very fast. It used to take 2+ hours to burn a 30 minute AVCHD disc. Now it takes 5-10 minutes for the same task. Windows 7 overall is much snappier; it starts faster, and applications like Outlook, Excel, and Word 2007 are much quicker. For the price, this is a great processor. I originally rated this at four stars, but based on experience and value, I'd rate it five stars today. Based on user comments, moving from a HDD to a SSD drive will improve performance even more. I'm planning such an upgrade this summer and will report my findings here.",

This means it's super efficient. It usually sits down near 0%. Turbo feature is awesome.Added 02/06/10- One thing to keep in mind is that this is a quad core processor! However Intel has done a good job of keeping price low and balancing the chip's power usage and performance. It will actually under-clock the CPU if left idle saving you $$$ on your energy bill and being green. The on the other hand, you can overclock it and really get high end performance from a $200 part.",
