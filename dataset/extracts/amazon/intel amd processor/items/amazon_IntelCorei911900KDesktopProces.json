                "reviewText": "This was Intel's top line CPU in the 11th generation; it used the LGA-1200 socket which was only minimally different from the LGA-1151 socket (1200 pins vs. 1151 pins). The motherboards for the LGA-1200 required only small changes in production spec, and the coolers made for the 1151 chips work perfectly on the LGA-1200. By contrast, the 12th generation, using the LGA-1700 socket, required an extensive redesign of motherboards, and the coolers that got adapted over from the LGA 1151/1200 didn't really work properly on the 12th and 13 generation Intel CPUs. This i9-11900K will pull about 170 watts through the socket at factory overclock 100%, and that's right on the limit of safe operation for the vast majority of air or liquid coolers on the market today.",

The base 3.5 GHz can easily support overclocking to 5GHz. I used the Intel Windows overclocking program and it was easy to do. The cpu installs easily and runs well.",

                "reviewText": "I had an i7 10700 that went kaput on me, so I figured, why not upgrade to the overclockable 11900K, since it was only about 50 bucks more to the the fastest CPU my mobo can handle. I did install water cooling because it does run warm, but let\u2019s just say this. My computer now works at warp 9.975. With the i9 10900k, a Nvidia 3060/12gb, and 128 GB DDR4 at 3200mhz, on userbenchmark website the lowest score I got was a 104% for gaming (UFO ranking). I overclock it a lot and it holds up well, and stays under 50c with the water cooling for me.11/10, would recommend, promote ahead of peers.",

Then a day or so later, delivered to usps. Sat in Des Moines IA for 4 days. Then it crawled to me well after predicted time. Don't ship this way. Its the worst way too ship. Also you shipped it in a Thin bubble wrap bag. Should have been in a box. Its a fragile chip, but thank you for a good working product with no issues as of yet.",
