                "reviewText": "I got this 6 core/ 12 thread processor for a 2nd system build I put together recently. It installed in the MSI motherboard's AM5 socket without a hitch. I am using it on an MSI B650 Pro board, with 32 GB DDR5 RAM and a 1 TB NVME drive. I also paired this with a Zotac 3060 RTX graphics card. The processor comes with a stock cooler but I opted to use a larger heatsink with an RGB fan. It performs very well on Cinebench testing for 10 minutes, and it does not throttle during testing. Temperature maxed out at 76 C, and it idles at 43 C, so it's well below the tjmax of 95 C. Cinebench score is about 14000 for multicore stressing. I used a good thermal paste on the processor heat spreader so I guess that is a factor too in the thermal performance. So far my new system has been stable for a week now. Performance for games is not only determined by the CPU, but also determined by the system as a whole, especially the graphics card performance. In any case, this AMD processor performs very well as expected.",

                "reviewText": "First time PC builder here.Everything went swimmingly, and this CPU install was great!Paired it with a Radeon RX 7800XT and they pair nicely.The stealth cooler that came with it was great!Super quiet, easy to install and was just great.After hours of playing a game on high/ultra settings, was reading CPU max temps of 83 degrees C.I ended up installing a Peerless Assassin 120 and brought that down to 73 degrees C.Overall, great CPU especially for the money.Would recommend!",
