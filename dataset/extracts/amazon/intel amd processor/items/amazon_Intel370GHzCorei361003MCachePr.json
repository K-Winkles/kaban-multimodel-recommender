                "reviewText": "Just completed 2 Mini ITX HTPC builds/rebuilds with these new Skylake chips. Wow! these units edge out the performance of my nearly 3 year old Ivy Bridge I7-3770S and I5-3570K builds for less than half the cost. Now and 3 years ago I used the best available Asrock ITX boards to enhance what I want in these units: feature rich power HTPC's that can run nearly silently with ultra low profile CPU fans without burning up. With the previous builds I had to use the motherboard's built in controls to slightly underclock the CPU's to get the thermal and quiet noise level patterns I wanted. Now I have used 2 new Fatal1ty Z170 Gaming-ITX/ac boards with thirteen buck Rosewill RCX-Z775-LP 80mm Sleeve Low Profile CPU Coolers that without underclocking run the new I3's quietly 10-15 Celsius lower than the old builds. Plus I now have HTPC's that have HDMI 2.0 ports that can run 4K video at 60Hz.I am not a gamer, so I also used the Fatal1ty Z170 Gaming-ITX/ac boards to get the new USB3.1 and C ports and upgraded Audio. I suspect that gamers on a budget could put the cash saved on this Skylake I3 into a good Graphics board and small SSD - and still have a rocking machine. Recommend: Don't skimp on the motherboard though.Update: 5/18/2016: Just saw some old comments/questions: Yes, I am using onboard graphics only. My HTPC enclosures are only about 8X8X2.5 inches. In these tiny boxes the older I7 & I5 Ivy Bridge temperatures ran up fan speeds and noise too much for my tastes while watching video, so I artificially under clocked them in the bios to reduce the thermal profiles and quiet the fans to unnoticeable beyond 12-18 inches away from the units. The I3 Skylake builds run quietly as HTPC's without bios setting modifications. The only time fan speeds and noise increase are during maintenance tasks such as virus scans and OS update installs which run quickly with the I3's. But for my personal preference for snappy maintenance, the G4400 or G4500 Skylake dual-cores might have worked well as HTPC's for me. I did build a totally silent HTPC using an Asrock Q1900DC-ITX board which includes an Intel Quad-Core Processor J1900 with fanless heat sink and built in DC/DC power for cheap. It runs well as a HTPC, but it's pokey running maintenance tasks, so like the I3's better",

                "reviewText": "After my previous system burned out, I looked into building a budget-friendly microATX gaming PC. I considered going with a non-K i5, but after reading tons of reviews online and considering the fact that the 6100 was about $100 cheaper than the cheapest i5, I decided to choose the 6100. I am thoroughly impressed with its performance for such a good price. I had previously owned an i5-4690K OC'd to 4.1GHz with 8GB DDR3 memory. For considerably cheaper than my previous rig, I was able to snag the 6100, a microATX motherboard, and 16GB of DDR4. I also upgraded my SSD to a 256gb Samsung 850 EVO. My machine feels noticeably faster now. I am unsure of which part accounts for this, or if all of them working together is the culprit, but whatever the case may be it feels like greased lightning. I paired this with a Zotac GTX 1060 and have been getting 55-60FPS consistently at 1080p in The Witcher 3 with the CPU hitting a max of about 46C. I am also getting consistent 100FPS in Dwarf Fortress 2014 at a fortress population of 240 with little to no fortress or game optimization present. Anyone who has played DF knows how ludicrous that is. My previous rig, with its overclocked i5, could handle a pop of 120 before slowing down to 60FPS, and ground to a halt at anything over 160.Overall, this is quite possibly the best budget CPU out there. Don't let the fact that it only has two physical cores scare you: it's tough enough to handle anything you throw at it.",

                "reviewText": "I gotta say, I didn't think a $120ish i3 would impress me. I got it because I wanted to build a computer without breaking the bank, and reviews were kind to this little chip. Well, for like 95% of purposes, it not only does the job, but it does it WELL. Once I got my system built, I decided to stress-test it by doing things like video encoding, moving files, Excel calculations from last year's Quant class (at my college, quantitative chemical analysis is a very Excel-heavy course) and some gaming. Well, obviously with more highly threaded tasks, you're going to get more performance out of four physical cores (like an i5) and even more out of four physical cores with hyper-threading (like an i7), and it did reach mid 90's in terms of CPU utilization during the video encoding task. That said, the stock fan still managed to keep it cool during that task, which is nice. With everything else, it felt very quick- at no point did it feel like I was experiencing slowdown or anything. The only time it started to slow down a bit was when I was multitasking, with several downloads running simultaneously, plus moving files between drives and streaming music via Spotify. And surprisingly, it could run older games very well, even running newer games at low settings, but 1080p and playable framerates. But if you want to enable more graphical bells and whistles, my recommendation would be to get a discrete GPU, as the integrated graphics are respectable in comparison to older generations of Intel IGPs, but nothing special at all in the overall scheme of things.",

                "reviewText": "excelente pieza de pc de muy buena calidad, muy buen desempe\u00f1o ideal para armar una pc de potencia mediana para trabajos o entretenimiento muy estable en trabajos pesados como render o videojuegos siempre y cuando este instalado en una buena tarjeta madre y acompa\u00f1ada de confiable memoria ram y un buen discoduro o ssd. lo esencial para lo que lo voy a usar este procesador es mas para jugar video juegos que usan mayor recursos de computo, aunque podr\u00eda haber comprado un core i7 pero primero quiero empezar con este procesador aparte quiero ver por mi propia cuenta que tal va en rendimiento y pues hasta ahora si cumple con todo el trabajo que le he puesto, es el primer core i3 que compro, hab\u00eda comprado procesadores mas bajos como el Pentium o atlon o phenom etc. pero pues este procesador es muy bueno en calidad precio en todo.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this as part of a cheap gaming computer for a family member. Paired with a Nvidia GTX 970 and 8gb of DDR4 ram it is able t run most modern games comfortably.As most games depend hugely on the GPU, with many more not even using more than 2 cores, the speed of this processor means it performs really well.If you intend of using this for multiple tasks over many screens, or for any form of rendering, then consider and i5 instead. Otherwise this is a great choice for a cheaper gaming PC.",

                "reviewText": "Au d\u00e9part j'\u00e9tais partis pour prendre un i5 s\u00e9rie K. Et la sortie des kaby lake \u00e9tant proche j'ai pas trop voulu investir dans un processeur haut de gamme. J'ai donc commande ce i3 s\u00e9rie Skylake et j'en suis pas d\u00e9\u00e7u !!Il culmine \u00e0 3.7 GHz, et reste \u00e0 moins de 50\u00b0 avec un TX evo 212 (ventirad d\u2019origine trop bruyant), et est tr\u00e8s silencieux malgr\u00e8 tout.Il r\u00e9pond tr\u00e8s bien au demande que je lui soumet (mod\u00e9lisation, streaming, gaming), coupl\u00e9 \u00e0 une gtx 750 ti il fait tourner par exemple:- skyrim \u00e0 60 fps en ultra haute d\u00e9finition (1080p)- fallout 4 \u00e0 60 fps en hight (1080p)- fallout new vegas \u00e0 60 fps en ultra- wow en ultra \u00e0 135 fps et m\u00eame gta V \u00e0 40 fps en medium !!Alors oui la nouvelle g\u00e9n\u00e9ration d'i3 skylake supporte le gaming si coupl\u00e9 \u00e0 un bon GPU. Il est id\u00e9al pour de configurations \u00e0 moins de 600e comme la mienne :)",
