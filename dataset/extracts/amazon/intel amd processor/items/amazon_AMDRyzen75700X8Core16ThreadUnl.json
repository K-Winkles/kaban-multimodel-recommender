Just watch a youtube how to do it. The only problem I had with it was I didn't see the little pamphlet in the box that said to upgrade my BIOS version before upgrading. Unfortunately, I was one version outdated. Had to uninstall, reinstall the old CPU, do a BIOS update which was a B, then do the swap again. Needless to say, went through a whole tube of thermal paste by the time I was done (speaking of, this does not include the paste nor the cooler).",

I also got a RX 6800 and it's compatible with it with no bottleneck. I got the cpu for $182 black Friday. If you can grab with that price than it's worth it. Just as good as the Ryzen 5 5800x, but uses less battery consumption which is great for me since I use a lot of RGB for my computer. Note! It doesn't come with a air cooler. Need to buy your own and it can't be a basic cooler. You need a mid tier fan or low tier AIO to keep it cool. Noise is silent depending on what fan you get. Good for any AMD B450 motherboard.",

Eigentlich muss man dem Hardwareteilek\u00e4ufer sowas nicht rezensieren, und ich kaufe Hardware ungern bei Amazon, aber die CPU war hier zu der Zeit am g\u00fcnstigsten, erf\u00fcllte die Erwartungen und erm\u00f6glichte tats\u00e4chlich ein Upgrade, bevor man auf die im Moment noch sauteure AM5-Plattform umsteigen muss. Amazons Lieferpraxis war ausschlaggebend.Und einen CPU-Wechsel ohne Boardwechsel hatte ich seit Jahren nicht, wechsele allerdings auch nur alle paar Jahre die Plattform aus und bleibe auf mittleren CPUs in meinem Szenario. Bei Full-HD Gaming ist in meinem Fall die GraKa der Flaschenhals. 64GB Ram hab ich mir auch geg\u00f6nnt. Alles sch\u00f6n entspannt und ein bi\u00dfchen Ruhe, bis die AM5-Preise sich einkriegen.Technische Daten und Benchmarks gibts im Netz und die Packung brauche ich nicht bewerten, ich w\u00fcrde auch Trays verbauen.",
