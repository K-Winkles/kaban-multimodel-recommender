                "reviewText": "Summary:If you want a mid-range machine that's future proof for at least the next few years, this fits the bill nicely. Get a chip that trades blows with an i9-9900K for $200 less and uses less power doing it. Yes, Intel's higher clock speed will allow it to be faster at certain workloads & games, but it's usually not by much. Regarding gaming, if you're running at 1080p or 1440p and not running a top of the line video card, the difference between the 3700x and 9900K is negligible. For workstation use, it's a no brainer, unless you want to up to a 3900x.Building computers and keeping up to date with all the latest hardware is my hobby and second job. I was an AMD guy back in the Athlon XP & Athlon 64 days, but once it was Sandy Bridge vs Buldozer, there was basically no reason to go AMD. For years, I built basically nothing but Intel Machines. Ryzen's intro was exciting to me, AMD is now competitive again! But other than a couple of builds for people, I skipped the first 2 generations. Now, Gen 2 chips are cheap, and Gen 3 chips can not only hold there own, but often outperform Intel in many tasks, sometimes even gaming! And even when they loose, it's not by much.So the 3700x gives great performance for the money, but what about stability and easy of setup? Well, it's nearly as good as Intel. Regarding stability, I'd say their fantastic as long as you avoid AMD Video Card drivers, which are a bit flaky at the moment. But with an Nvidia card, rock stable. Now, I said nearly as good as intel due to the drivers, BIOS updates, and power and voltage situation. For most current intel systems, the platform is so mature that everything generally just works out of the box. No drivers or power plans required, Windows 10 knows what to do with the platform. But with AMD Zen 2, there are potential issues on older chip-sets and not being able to boot without BIOS updates, performance issues with older BIOS updates, etc. On top of that, you really want to get the chip-set drivers & power plans to have the best configuration. None of this is hard, but Intel is already so integrated into Windows 10. But with Ryzen gaining market-share at their current pace, integration and optimization will be there soon.Most of the time, you want to build a balanced system. Here are my CPU suggestions based on price points (Approximations)$500 to $800 builds: 1600X AF (Which is basically a 2600X)$800 to $1300 Builds: 3600$1200 to $2500 Builds: 3700X$1800 to $3400 Builds: 3900X$2500+ Builds: $3950XMy wife and I rebuild our gaming systems this past Holiday season. Here's my latest rig with this chip:Processor: AMD 3700XVideo Card: Nvidia GTX 1070 (used)RAM: 32GB G-Skill Dual Channel 3600Mhz CAS16Motherboard: MSI X570 Carbon (Good For 3800X and below, VRMs may run hot on 3900X and above)Sound: Sound Blaster ZSSD: 1GB A-DATA SX8200 Pro & 2x 2TB Crucial (1100 & MX500)PSU: Seasonic 750W GoldCase: Fractal Design Define CCPU Cooler: Noctua DH-15Fans: 4x 140mm Noctua AF-14 & 1x 120mm Noctua AF-12Gaming and productivity have been fantastic with no issues. I really want more GPU power, but I'm waiting for the prices to come down for Nvidia or for AMD to get their driver act together. GTX 1070s can be had for under $200 used, and compare well to GTX 1660 Supers (We got ours before this was an option). If you have the money The 2070 S would be my go to. I could have invested the cost of the expensive fans and CPU cooler to a faster video card or 3900x, but having a system that's quiet, cool, and fast is important to me.Here's to hoping Ryzen continues down this path!",

                "reviewText": "First, I bough this in replacement to a 10700k that wasn't working (long story...). Unable to find the intel CPU at stock, I decided to go with the 3700x, especially for the value and...I am glad that I make this choice!This is my first AMD CPU, I was afraid of a lot of things, but everything went smoothly. The package was in perfect state, thank you Amazon for listening to my previous feedback about international packages, very satisfied this time. I got the included game without any problem, waiting for it to release now. Zero RAM issue, and this one is a solid piece of hardware. No need to OC, mine boost very well, maybe I got lucky with silicone lottery. Coupled with an old GTX 1070 from my Dell OEM and hoping to be able to get a 3070 or 3080 (in actual state, a far dream due to stock issues). Compared to my previous i7 8700 (non k), the gaming experience is a lot better because I never close my other apps due to work.Is I have to find cons. the only thing that annoy me a little is idle temperature being around 50, but it's really just a detail, far from being a deal breaker. Especially since at 100% load the temp is 77 deg and in gaming I have yet to see it reaching 70 deg with my Arctic freezer esports 34 duo.Pros:- Good performance- Included cooler- Included game- PCIe 4- Incredible value- Good thermals in gaming (compared to my previous CPU)Cons:- Nothing for now.Average:- IDLE voltage and temp (maybe it's the mobo?)",

If you use normal HDD with the Ryzen 7 3700X its waste. NVMe PCIe M.2 SSD is a must - since its directly connected to processor (in supported motherboard) it utilizes max bandwidth improving performance. For the Ryzen 7 3700X, you'll want to install 3000MHz or faster modules.Only compromise i did was the cabinet. I did not go for flashy one; but cost effective and one which gives decent cooling solution. Do not spend over Rs.5,000 for cabinet.
