                "reviewText": "This is probably the cheapest processor on the market that won't bottleneck your graphics card. I did some early testing with an RX 5700 to see if there was any sign of bottlenecks caused by the CPU. What I found is that I was getting the exact same performance as tech sites were with the RX 5700 where they were using the i9-9900k processors. Its possible that perhaps a RTX 2080 might be too much for it, but even that I doubt and if it were, the bottleneck would probably be minimal. I'm seeing 100% GPU bound in games like Gears 5/Gears 4 (where that rating is available). I now have my RX 5700 overclocked with custom power tables to 2024mhz. I still see 100% GPU bound ratings so the CPU is definitely strong enough for the RX 5700 XT as well. I did put a larger CPU cooler and 120mm fan. From what I can tell the CPU runs nearly 100% of the time (in game) at the boost speed, which is 3.9ghz for all cores. The temperature with the cooler I have on it does not exceed 52C, I know the boost clocks will slowdown if the CPU gets too hot, so that was my reason for installing the better cooler, although I'm not sure it was entirely necessary. For less than $150, I'm not sure there is anything that currently beats this CPU provided you are using a discrete graphics card. I nearly bought an i3-9100f with the plan to upgrade the CPU later, but after doing the research determine the i5-9400f would be a better value and last me much longer before the need to upgrade, especially since this was a gaming build. At present, I don't believe there was any reason for a more expensive processor for gaming. Obviously if you are building at the top end, you would probably be going with a higher end processor anyway. I was trying to get bang for my buck and I think the i5-9400f and RX 5700 build (esp since I got the RX 5700 for $280) accomplished that.",

I get a decent frame rate on high settings in most games like war zone, pubg, insurgency sandstorm. I even edited a 5 min YouTube video and it handled it like a champ 2:38 for full render. If your looking for a budget cpu for gaming this will do the job nicely.My only con to this cpu is the heat sink. Yes it keeps cpu cool, but I have had a problem with the 4 retention pins came loose at one point and kinda sagged and flipped around on top of the cpu. So make sure you are correctly and fully connected to mobo before doing to much handling. Or just get an aftermarket cooler with a bracket and screws and discard the stock cooler. That being said I am still using the stock cooler.",

                "reviewText": "besides despite AMD releasing the ever affordable Ryzen series for that low of a price, God Bless you BTW, but i just dont want to be a Beta guy. Sorry AMD, but INTEL right now will always have fastest and best core per performance over Ryzen, minus the beta issue where bugs and glitches and kinks aren't really all worked out, intel to me is more stable right now, but they better stop trying to be like apple and lower their damn prices cause AMD and Ryzen is going to sweep them under he rug if they hadn't already,believe it or not i replaced an i3 8100. ikr i play world of Warcraft and its a CPU intensive compared to being a graphical game. since i already have a graphics card, a msi rx 580 my old cpu just couldnt get my graphics to run full steam, what i mean is the cpu was the bottle neck, for budget wise i went with the i5 9400f. i got the asrog b365 pro 4 mobo and i am loving this setup, the 6 cores and 6 threads have future proofed me for the next couple years intel chips have the best cores hands down, amd has more threads and will rule the near foreseeable future but i am totally content with this i5 9400F. if the price dropped a little more for the 9600k that woulda been the way to go, pair that off with a z-board and the rest of the world could future proof themselves. if you are a multi tasker and streamer, video encoder or work station geared i wouldn't suggest getting this chip, rather get the AMD ryzen series, you get more bang for the buck going that route. AMD is ruling right now. BUT i feel great about this purchase cause now my only issue will be getting a better graphics card but for world of Warcraft mmo i am all set. well i hope i helped GL all,",
