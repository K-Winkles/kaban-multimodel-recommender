Idles in my rig at between 55\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 with air cooling but doesn't go beyond 82\u00b0 when stress tested. I've read where some people were concerned about it idling at 70\u00b0 but it's rated to withstand 120\u00b0. So, a little warm, but high performing. Definitely worth the sale price of $287 (especially if you're used to spending around $350 for a new CPU.)",

                "reviewText": "I decided to upgrade my motherboard with this 11th Generation i7 11700K CPU from a i7 10700KF to bump overall performance as well as the Gen 4 nvme m.2 SSD support. It took less time than I thought to remove the AIO water cooling, swap out the 32GB of DDR4 for 64GB as well as installing the 2TB Gen 4 SSD. I reassembled all of the disconnected components and powered back up into the BIOS. Everything was recognized and playing nicely. Performed a Clean OS install and am quite pleased with the outcome. I would definitely recommend for those that have a motherboard with an upgrade path. I think you will be happy you did.",

                "reviewText": "the i7 11700K 11th gen sits in between the well reviewed i5 and the poorly priced i9 11900k. I think at this price (I got it at pre-launch sale of $399) it's a good product. It's cheaper than the 5800X, performs very close to it and is a lot more fun to Overclock. Rocket Lake (11th gen) supports specific core overclocks to dial in ratios for the two best cores and other less hot cores. It also can take a tad bit more voltage than skylake++++ (1.45V load voltage supposedly safe according to Reddit AMA) although running at slightly lower all core clocks than comet lake with improved IPC. This actually seems to run slightly cooler for me but power draw can be pretty nuts on stress tests. Gaming load is not bad at all I was seeing around 100w on Horizon Zero Dawn.Unless you want the highest overclocks, the i7 can still get you pretty close or above the stock clocks of the i9 with manual tuning without the price premium and similar real world performance. Coming from the i9-10900k, the gaming FPS is pretty similar at UW 1440p, but rocket lake seems much more stable with overclocking - as in you get watch dog BSOD errors or you don\u2019t - not the WHEA stuff. The RAM gear stuff is a little overblown, the performance penalty of running 1:2 is not as bad as what you see on Ryzen. You can run very high speed ram 4800+ and looser timings and get a ton of performance from these chips. I'm an enthusiast and I've had Ryzen and Intel systems and I just enjoy tuning Intel CPUs. Glad to be one of the first to review this. This came in as same day delivery! Happy overclocking everyone.",

The only down side to this cpu is that it eats 125 watts and produces quite a bit of heat. My case exhaust fans make noticeable noise keeping my case cool. Having said that, with proper cooling it is easy to keep the cpu under 70 c (under heavy load mine runs 58-65).",

                "reviewText": "...some of the draw backs are basically runs VERY hot even at idle compared to other generations (stays at 40+ C with 24 C ambient temp), but I concede I think I may need to adjust my case fan speeds to get a more aggressively positive pressure airflow in the case. HOWEVER< it barely gets much hotter under full load so perhaps I have tuned fairly well...Value is just OK. It is a bit lower than the 12th gen counterpart, and continually getting a bit cheaper all the time, but it is still close enough in price that if you CAN go with a 12th gen intel build, I would have just gone that route (I was pretty much limited with my choice of mobo, so i could only go as high as 11th gen intel and gen3 m.2).But it has been amazing so far in terms of performance under load, and I see this build carrying me for 4-5 years! I hope.",
