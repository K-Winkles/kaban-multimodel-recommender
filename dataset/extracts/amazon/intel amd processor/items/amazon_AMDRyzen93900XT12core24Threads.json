So I looked around, and since my son has the R7 2700x and was pleased with it, I decided to go with Ryzen. But I wanted something that I could throw anything at and handle it with ease. I saw the new R9 3900xt, which has a small boost up from the 3900x. So now I have my computer running and WOW, I've been missing a lot. On Minecraft, chunks load a lot faster, not at a snail pace. Need for Speed is great. getting huge fps. With the i7, the game would run the cpu at 100%. This R9 is barely using 7% of it's weight in running NFS. Let's not forget about downloads. This thing is quick. The i7 would take forever. go get snack and take a nap and it's still downloading.

They recommend a water cooler, however, I am using a Noctua NH-D15 cooler in the single fan configuration (dual fans wouldn't fit as my RAM is too tall) - and it keeps the CPU below 60\u00b0C during idle and playing games. I have yet to run anything that even pushes the maximum power out of this CPU. I would definitely recommend this as an upgrade, and even for new PC builds. Just be aware that this requires a discreet (separate) graphics card, as there are no integrated graphics. If you have an issue with a BIOS update - AMD will send you a \"bootkit\" loaner for free, which will allow you to update your BIOS and install your new CPU.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars AMD's Fastest Mainstream Part",
                "reviewText": "Three years ago, I build a system with an Intel i7 7700K. Last month, I replaced that Intel with an AMD R7 3800X, which advertised a 4.5GHz speed, but typically delivered about 4.2 for single core loads and 4.0 for all core. That isn't unusual for Ryzen CPU's, where your \"up to\" speed and your actual speed will vary by 200-300MHz. The single core speed just wasn't enough of an improvement over my old Intel. It also isn't worth my time (or yours) trying to mess with overclock settings when the chip is pretty well optimized out of the box.Enter the new XT processors. I could have swapped up to the 3800XT, which would have given me the speed bump I wanted, but would have cost $70 more for just that extra MHz. The 3900XT here was $170 more, but delivered 50% more cores as well as the same low-load speed of the lesser XT chip. It's the better value, and likely the more future-proof solution as well, as more software is written to take advantage of high core counts.So what does this 3900XT do? It does indeed hit the 4.7GHz advertised speed on 2 cores (4766MHz to be exact). It will do this while you're browsing the web or otherwise not doing much. Low-to-Medium use cases (e.g. games) will see the chip turbo up to 4.2-4.5GHz. The heaviest loads will see a boost to 4.0-4.2GHz. The exact number depends on the specific kind of program being run. In general, it's a 5-10% improvement over the 3800X.Your exact chip will vary a bit from these figures, likely less than 100MHz. It might also depend on your cooling setup. I stuck my 3900XT into a ITX box and a compact heat sink (pictured). More robust cooling and a more aggressive PBO (a built-in overclocking function) could probably net you slightly better performance. Again, on the order of 100-150MHz. So you could, potentially, see 4.7+ top speeds and 4.6 in-game turbos. However, AMD doesn't leave performance hanging out there.The main thing to consider is why this over the 3900X (no \"T\") which can be had for $70-100 less. In my case, I was choosing the better binning, the better chance of hitting higher low-thread clocks, and (preferably) lower heat. In short, I wanted a sure bet. The 3900XT delivers. This chip, unless you're hitting all 12 cores with 24 threads, actually runs as cool or cooler than my 3800X.So if you're looking for a lot of GHz and a lot of cores, and money isn't really an object, get this. There will be something new around the corner (there always is) and at that point, maybe you should get that instead. Right here, right now, there isn't a lot that's better.",

                "reviewTitle": "Runs hot, but still a great CPU.",
                "reviewText": "This was an upgrade from the 2700X, so that's my basis for comparison (being as the rest of the system is identical). I picked up the XT variant, but how much difference there is between the X & XT is debatable. In terms of power draw, it beats the 2700X handily, with a stable all-core overclock of 4.350GHz at ~1.34v, whereas the 2700X required closer to 1.41v for the same clockspeed. Interestingly both the 2700X & 3900XT have similar top frequencies, at least that's my experience so far. The 3900XT runs much, much hotter than the 2700X, and that's even with a very substantial custom loop (360\u00d730, 240\u00d745 & 360\u00d780 rads). Idle temp is low 40s, under load it can easily jump to the low 80s. The 2700X was ~10\u00b0C lower across the board. Whether this is something to do with AMD changing how the temperature is reported (that is pure speculation on my part) or some other issue I'm not sure. Online I found many users had similar experiences vis-a-vis the higher temps. But it's still within spec, so I would just say make sure you have a decent cooling solution. Overall though I'm pleased with it. How much difference users notice depends greatly on what you're upgrading from, and what you're using your system to run. If you're currently using an 8 core Ryzen processor (any generation) and are using your system mostly or exclusively for gaming, I might hold off until prices come down, because the difference you'll notice will probably be fairly modest. Which for $600 or $700 is not a very good ROI.",

Aunque la calidad / precio es m\u00e1s cara que la 3900X, la calidad / precio tambi\u00e9n es alta. Comparado con el Intel i9 de d\u00e9cima generaci\u00f3n, me sabe mejor. Este es un prop\u00f3sito m\u00e1s general, si quieres jugar mientras juegas, es mejor que Intel i9. Si solo quiere jugar pero no quiere grabar juegos o transmisiones en vivo, compre el i9 de d\u00e9cima generaci\u00f3n (la novena generaci\u00f3n es peor). Para el renderizado de fotos y videos en 4K me va genial, lo mueve todo con mucha facilidad. He de decir que lo tengo montado con refrigeraci\u00f3n l\u00edquida para bajarle un poco la temperatura porque lo he overcrackeado.",

It easily boosts to 4.4 to 4.5 at 83 to 84 Celsius(single core)using an air cooler (hyper 212 black edition, case is deep cool Matrexx 50 air flow). Cinebench R23 gives me all core 4.2 GHz, PBO on, on the ASUS TUF x570 Plus WiFi(TIP do not update to BIOS 3001, it has some nasty bugs with Zen 2 processors).There are plenty of websites that have the Pro's and Con's for this processor, not going to delve into this.Advice is to get a good board with a Decent VRM's and get a good cooler to get good performance.If you are in no hurry to build a PC, I suggest you wait for price drops, when Zen 3 starts to become more available or when Intel Rocket lake releases early next year.Do not play many Games on this but if you do then I suggest to get the Zen 3 models.",

Es ist zwar nicht der volle Preis des Spiels, aber ein megafaires Angebot. Und es dauert ja in der Regel auch nicht furchtbar lange, bis dann bei steam ein entsprechender Deal kommt.Kunde gl\u00fccklich, alles gut. Danke!",
