                "reviewText": "This is supposed to be a 'renewed' item ,according to Amazon this means it should have been tested to confirm it works. Yet the item arrived DOA. I installed it to a board that had the same gen I-3 installed. Would only power loop with light codes hanging on CPU. Put the I-3 back in works fine. tried it on another working board hangs on CPU and power cycles. Even tried new Power Supply and same result. I have raised this to 5 stars as the seller reached out after hearing the chip was DOA and offered a full refund.",
