Now that I have it stable, I get fantastic performance. Considering that the equivalent Intel CPU is something like twice the price, this is absolutely worth the price. I would recommend using a Gigabyte motherboard and RAM 3000mhz or faster.For clarity, this CPU is not the best for gaming. It requires a lot of tuning and settings tweaking to get it to an optimal framerate. This is not a gaming CPU. Definitely do not get it if you're just going to be gaming on your system.",

                "reviewText": "First off, if you are looking at this (or any Threadripper CPU) for gaming, look elsewhere. Threadripper is decent for games, but the Ryzen 9 3900x or pretty much any recent Intel Core i7 or above will give you better performance for less money. That said, if your workload is more compute heavy and multithreaded, like video editing, 3D modeling and rendering, application development, and the like, it's hard to go wrong with Threadripper. The particular CPU I got overclocks well, and I was able to easily hit 4.25 GHz on all cores, though your mileage may vary. The only problem I have with this part is how much heat it puts out.",
