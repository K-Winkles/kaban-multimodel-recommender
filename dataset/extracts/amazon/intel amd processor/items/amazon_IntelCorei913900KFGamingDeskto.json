                "reviewText": "The Intel Core i9-13900KF, the latest-gen gaming desktop processor, is nothing short of a powerhouse when it comes to delivering unparalleled performance for gamers and enthusiasts alike. With 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) and unlocked overclocking potential, it redefines what you can expect from a gaming processor.Performance (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605): The Intel Core i9-13900KF is an absolute beast when it comes to performance. With its combination of P-cores for high single-threaded performance and E-cores for multi-threaded tasks, it effortlessly handles anything you throw at it. Whether you're gaming, streaming, or running resource-intensive applications, this processor delivers smooth and lag-free performance.Overclocking (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605): If you're an overclocking enthusiast, this processor is a dream come true. Being unlocked, it provides you with the flexibility to push its limits further. With proper cooling and tweaking, you can extract even more performance, making it a top choice for those who love to fine-tune their system.Gaming (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605): Gaming with the Intel Core i9-13900KF is a sublime experience. It excels in delivering high frame rates and low latency, ensuring you get the most out of your gaming sessions. It handles modern AAA titles with ease, and thanks to the E-cores, it can handle background tasks like streaming without breaking a sweat.Thermal Design (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605): While this processor is a powerhouse, it's important to note that it can generate significant heat when pushed to its limits. To fully unleash its potential, investing in a high-quality cooling solution is essential. A well-cooled system will ensure the CPU operates at its peak performance without thermal throttling.Value for Money (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606): There's no denying that the Intel Core i9-13900KF comes with a premium price tag. However, for those who demand the absolute best in gaming and multitasking performance, it's worth every penny. It's an investment in a system that will remain relevant and powerful for years to come.Compatibility (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606): It's important to note that this processor requires a compatible LGA 1700 motherboard, which may necessitate a motherboard upgrade if you're coming from an older system. Additionally, it doesn't include integrated graphics, so a dedicated graphics card is a must.In conclusion, the Intel Core i9-13900KF is a game-changing gaming desktop processor that sets new standards in performance and overclocking capabilities. Its 24 cores, unlocked nature, and exceptional gaming prowess make it a top choice for gamers and enthusiasts who demand the best. While it comes at a premium price, the investment is justified by the unparalleled performance and future-proofing it offers. If you're looking to build the ultimate gaming rig, the Intel Core i9-13900KF should be at the top of your list.",

                "reviewText": "It's fast, and works better than my space heater for keeping the desk undersides warm. Too warm, really.UPS says the computer is using 575 watts during the CPU stress test, about 175 watts at idle. TPU is 253w ... so with the 80%+ PS inefficiency, 300w makes sense.When using the 3080 GPU with the i9 CPU ... well, the heat coming from the case is similar to a 1000w space heater, really. Now reconsidering my choice for only an 850w PS. 1000w would probably be a better idea for this beast.As for speed. That's relative. But I am coming from an i9-7900x, and this is 3x faster, and it feels 3x faster. Memory is slower, (4ch vs 2ch) -- so I had to use DDR5-6400 to get a similar memory bandwidth. Lost some latency, but the overall effect is the thing still seems plenty fast.I dislike the way the CPU case instantly jumps to 100c -- no thermal mass what-so-ever in the CPU case. Or I have a bad CPU without whatever filler Intel puts between the die and the case.In any case, Intel needs to allow for more thermal mass to reduce these thermal stresses of instantaneous temp changes. Has to be stressing the silicon and lead to more thermal stress failures.",

I paired it with a rtx 4080 and needless to say this cpu doesn\u2019t disappoint. Now, this review isn\u2019t about pricing because we all know this cpu is expensive and honestly if you\u2019re only gaming then maybe a 13600k would suffice. However, if you are streaming, photo editing, video editing etc\u2026. Then this is the right cpu for you. I\u2019m able to snap together YouTube videos in seconds NOT minutes or anywhere near it. I\u2019m able to stream and game at the same time with less than a 10 fps loss while gaming and streaming on the highest quality settings. My wife loves it for photo editing bc everything is just perfect. Only downside is that it does run hot but you can get a good 240-360mm aio that will tame this cpu with ease. All the issues I use to have on the 10th gen platform are completely irradiated now that I own this cpu. I did go with the ddr5 and honestly for me it runs better than ddr4. Tech reviewers say otherwise but from personal experience ddr5 is the future NOW. Performance issues I use to have with ddr4 and weaker cpus are just gone now. I can do so much and this cpu doesn\u2019t break a sweat. For instance, ddr4 for whatever reason sometimes wouldn\u2019t work with xmp although it was advertised. I like to tinker so it wasn\u2019t an issue BUT sometimes it\u2019s just nice to do a single click and let it dial itself in and that\u2019s what ddr5 has done for me. I\u2019ve used several different sticks with this cpu and from all of them I went with Corsair vengeance. Honestly, this is the most bada$$ cpu I\u2019ve ever owned or seen in a personal system of mine. If you have the money I couldn\u2019t recommend it enough. Everybody has different needs and in my case I needed this cpu. It hasn\u2019t disappointed. As for amd, if you want the bugs and issues go ahead and grab one of those cpus and tell me how that goes. This cpu can do everything and more. Hope this review helps anybody who is on the edge about getting this or something else.",

I think you would need at least a 1200 psu to get a full overclock . I have a 1000 watt psu but I was only able to get it to 5.5 . On full load it use's 900 watts of power. I can't over clock it to 5.6 gigahertz. I think I should of got the K version instead of the KF. Having said that, 24 cores pretty amazing. I will give a i9 13900kf a 5 star rating. I can play all my games at 1440p on ultra settings and get a 100fps with my rtx 3080 12gb . There is no stuttering or anything, everything is butter smooth.",
