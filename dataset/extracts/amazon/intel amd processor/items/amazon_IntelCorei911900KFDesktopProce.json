There are detailed explanations for all that, which I won't go into. The bottom line is, because of chip design, current CPU coolers, and power requirements, it's very difficult and very expensive to get better real world performance from the 12th and 13th generation chips. This is why Intel is abandoning the LGA-1700 socket after just two years and starting over. In the meantime, AMD has taken huge chunks of market share, particularly in applications that operate near 100% current load. The i9-11900K or KF reached the optimal limit of the LGA-1200 socket. It has an excellent CPU cooling interface and will run all day long at a TDP of 170 watts, completely stable and reliable with 8 cores at 4.8 GHz. And that's not something the 12s and 13s are able to do.",

From the 10-core i9 10900 to an 8-core i9 11900 that only matched and sometimes lagged behind the previous gen (mostly in productivity apps, not gaming) seemed a step backwards. And at the original price, I agree completely. But at these current, deeply discounted prices, and factoring in PCIe v4 and NVME 4.0, plus the ability to turbo beyond 5.3 GHz at safe Vcore values, this CPU begins to look like a viable upgrade path from 10th gen. All-in-all, I'm very satisfied with the performance upgrade and the reasonable price to achieve it. Still, it's hard to believe this CPU is already two generations behind. Sigh....",

New Intel desktop processors have only 20 PCIE lanes. The X299 platform only supports up to 10th Gen, but has 40+ lanes. I hate being forced to use older technology just to get more lanes for expansion cards.",
