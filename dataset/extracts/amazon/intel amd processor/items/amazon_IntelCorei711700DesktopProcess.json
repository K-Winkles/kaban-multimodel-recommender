I had wanted a new, unlocked version of the same CPU at a price increase of $80. Frustrated that Amazon is pushing used products on us along with new, I decided to return the CPU and order a new one. There was no problem returning the used CPU. After I had it boxed, labeled and ready to return, I found an $70, used, z590 motherboard. I kept the used CPU, installed it into my used z590 and I was able to upgrade one of my i7 6900 systems for less than $300. After comparing this with other identical used CPU's, this turned out to be a bargain especially because it came with New Intel CPU fan which will be great for testing. Glad I kept it. It arrived quickly and packaged well. I used the new CPU and motherboard that I ordered in another i7-68000 system upgrade.",

                "reviewText": "I just taught a 15 yr. old grandson how to build, and maintain his own computer. I chose a new MSI Z590-A motherboard, 32 gig of high speed gaming RAM, (DDR4 3200) and topped it off with this new 11th gen processor. Fired right up when he hit the switch! Grandson is proud of his work!I do recommend using the built-in graphics (UHD 750) in lieu of a stand alone Nvidia RTX card, due to availability, and a steep price point! Good cards are unavailable right now due to the worldwide chip shortage, which makes the price of RTX cards waaay too high. Wait till the costs come down.",
