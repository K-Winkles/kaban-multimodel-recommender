                "reviewText": "This is my second time buying this cpu. Sadly the first one died on me, it had to be overclocked to run and eventually it needed to overheat to even work or turn on and it just eventually wouldn't boot.So after carefully deliberating whether it was ram, motherboard or cpu, I bought ram, it didn't work. Went to the drawing board and did more tinkering and decided it had to be the cpu as said above. It's a very good cpu, but not entirely sure on quality, could've just been bad. Enable ReBar, PBO and XMP and you're good to go. Best paired with an AIO, with the original fan, it hit temps of 86c. Not good for me. AIO got me running 36c average and about 44c active and jumping to 50c occasionally. It hits advertised speeds and runs everything well. However I've noticed my usage does spike pretty high with what I run. So if you're a pretty heavy user, something a bit bigger might be better.I haven't run into performance issues with any games. At max 70% to 76%. Most times running around 20 to 30%. If you can get this cpu for about 115$, grab it. I wouldn't pay more than 120$.",

                "reviewText": "The 32MB of L3 cache on the 5600 and the strong single-core performance (I know, not cutting-edge single core perf. anymore in 2023, but still...) made this CPU a lifesaver for my framerate in modded Minecraft around the animal pens in my base (the kind of scenario where Minecraft proves to be the most CPU-bottlenecked experience of any PC game, in my experience).I upgraded to this from a Ryzen 7 1700, and noticed a drastic difference in performance with otherwise the same hardware.Here's the rundown of the performance difference I experienced from upgrading from Ryzen 7 1700 to Ryzen 5 5600 (see also the picture):[] ~30% improvement to 0.1% lows in Unigine Superposition @ 1080p Extreme (This means, much more stable framerate without stutters)[] ~12% improvement to 0.1% lows in MSI Kombustor MSI-01 OpenGL test 1080p (This means, more stable framerate without stutters)[] ~46% across-the-board improvement to average framerate, 1% lows, and 0.1% lows in Minecraft running what I call \"The chicken test\" (simulates lag around lots of active mobs)[] ~19% across-the-board improvement to average framerate, 1% lows, and 0.1% lows in Horizon Zero Dawn at 1080p Ultra Quality/Max settings[] ~51% single-core performance uplift in Cinebench R23[] ~23% multi-core performance uplift in Cinebench R23All in all the Ryzen 5 5600 is a fantastic budget upgrade if you have an older AM4 system. The motherboard being used here is an ASRock B450M A/C R-2.0.I have just upgraded the RAM now too and endeavor to see what the performance difference is with faster-clocked RAM versus the older RAM speeds on the 5600 that were same as what the Ryzen 7 1700 was running at.",

I upgraded from a lower-end Ryzen 5 card after buying a 2070, and honestly the pair has been great! I'm not getting 60 fps on ultra setting at 4k, however for my use case it works perfectly. There's little to no bottleneck with my card, and I would say that if you're looking for a graphics card that isn't in the current generation, it should work well with many graphics card. Overall I've been very pleased!",
