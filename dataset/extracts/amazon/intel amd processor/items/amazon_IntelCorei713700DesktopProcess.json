Having had the 9900k for the past few years, I struggled with going down to a locked i7. I could not be happier with my decision. I have used the cpu in both capped and uncapped throttling. I have settled on capped which runs at 5.2ghz across 8 cores and my cpu never gets above 50 degrees celsius on high end settings of games running with other apps open. The absolute positive for me is that I dropped from an AIO pump to a blade fin standard cooler. As a result the computer is cooler and fans run slower making the room less noisy and less heat.",

                "reviewText": "This is a GREAT little CPU. Super fasssssst with very low 65W TDP. Multiple cores handle video game processing with ease. Includes onboard video (if needed). Get yourself a good air cooler ( Thermalrite Assassin) and check your mobo CPU Turbo settings for PL1 and PL2. Start with 65W and 219W settings (per Intel). Even today, this CPU is commanding a bit of a premium price but it is still cheaper than the 13700K or KF versions. This is kind of a sleeper in the 13th gen series. Buy it !",
