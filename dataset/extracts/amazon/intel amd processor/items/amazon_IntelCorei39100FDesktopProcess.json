                "reviewText": "This processor is amazing. I did a lot of research on my son's computer. He is an avid Fortnite player, and likes, more like, loves performance!But, gee whiz, I can't afford to pop $1000 every time new games come out? Well, the current gaming computer wasn't horrible, but it's been like 8 years since it was majorly upgraded, and it makes a whirlwind of a difference!He was only getting around 40-50 FPS(frames per second) on the old motherboard/CPU, and he was in real need of an upgrade.One thing that I forgot to mention is that a good video card is important too. He has an AMD 480 in his, so for about $150-200, you'll need to invest in a decent video card. Personally, I like the EVGA 1660, but the 1650 Super is a good one too for around $200 or less range.Through my research, I found out that not only does the i5-9400F do well, but this i3-9100F does an amazing job at gaming as well.So, for those who love Fortnite, you'll genuinely love this processor as well, and it's worth the upgrade. Granted, most likely you'll have to get another motherboard, but I got one here as well, and it worked flawlessly!So, for about $75 or even less at times, you'll be astounded how well it performs. I did a benchmark on the processor within my sons computer, and it almost performed my older i7-3770K!!! Granted, that processor is about 10 years old now, and the i3 is only a few months old; Intel has done some major great jobs on their lower starting CPU'S!Great job, Intel!Our Build:i3-9100FMSI ProSeries H310 motherboardCorsair Vengence 8gb DDR4 Memory Stick-Just 1 stick 8gb.Antec Case750 Thermaltech PSUAMD RX 480 GPUAnd, we decided to get a new case to package it all together!Please make comments, what do you think?",

MY BUILD:Motherboard: Gigabyte 365M ($75 new on amazon)CPU: I3 9100F ($71 new on amazon)GPU: Zotac 1060 6GB (on ebay used for $150)RAM: Oloy DDR4 8x2gb ($52 new on amazon and they look great for cheap DDR4)STORAGE: Kingston 240gb m.2 ($29 new on Amazon)CASE: CoolerMaster QL300 ($50 new on Amazon)PSU: Thermaltake white 500WThis is an amazing deal for the price. At THE MOMENT you cannot make a Ryzen build that is cheaper than this for the same performance in games (July 16th 2020 when ordered) The 9100F is just so good for $71, if you NEED more cores (you dont yet for gaming) then please save yourself the headache and get a Ryzen build or a 10th gen board (for the future upgrade path) but if you just want to game at 1080p then this is great.I installed windows off of a USB drive with the ISO file you can get for free from the windows website. I had to make 0 tweaks from the bios in order to get windows to begin install. I would say from power on to booting into windows took between 7-10 minutes. In my room while browsing or watching youtube this computer barely has to use its fans. While playing warzone the Intel stock cooler gets loud HOWEVER the Zotac 1060 stays quiet and the case fan does too. For my first budget build I love this. I bench marked it against my friends 6th gen i5 6400T 1060 build and it matches and beats it in all of the games that we play. I would definitely recommend this build/motherboard to anyone would like to try a cheap reliable gaming PC build.",

                "reviewText": "Pros: cheap, quiet, great VR and ultrawide desktop gaming performance, low power consumption, fastCons: not too great at multitaskingOverall, this is a wonderful CPU. I got it for a budget VR setup and I seriously couldn't be happier. I mean, where else are you going to find this price to performance ratio nowadays? VR games run perfectly. I run my system with a GTX 1080 and a Rift S and hold a constant 80 FPS in most games, even while streaming.The only thing you have to keep in mind multitasking - this CPU is just not very good at it. I experience slowdowns if I have too many program open at once. The single core performance is phenomenal, but it only has 4 cores and is not hyperthreaded, so multitasking is difficult for the little CPU that could. If you just make a habit of closing out of everything except your game and maybe discord and a web browser, you'll have no issues.I would highly recommend this to someone looking for a cheap PC build that can still run games and even stream VR.",

It handles the games I play fine tho with the limited Ram I am running currently the highest game I play GTA V tends to stutter but is still playable. I bought this and installed it into a brand new build (see specs below) and as it isn't a -over-the-top build with parts quite literally found at a thrift store it runs well. I see no issues when streaming youtube and playing the lower-end games I frequent like ROBLOX and Wizard 101 it takes the task with stride.Computer Specs (Condensed):CPU: Intel Core i3-9100FGraphics: AMD XFX R7870 with Ghost Thermal TechnologiesRam: 4GB, Corsair Vengeance DDR4 but upgrading to 16GB Silicon Power DDR4.Motherboard: Gigabyte H310M S2PStorage: 1TB Western Digital HDD",

Esportazione di file, decompressioni etc richiedono circa il doppio del tempo rispetto al processore amd, ma in gaming \u00e8 nettamente superiore. Consigliato per sistemi di fascia media.

                "reviewText": "That you are on a budget or not and you're build is just to game casually, right now, imo there is no point to go for any \"bigger\" than the i3-9100F. This CPU benchmarks better on single-core and quad-core than the i7 7700 and the i7 7700 is more than competent and capable for today's needs. My build runs LoL at 80 fps with everything maxed. If you want to record and stream your games as you play, I recommend you go for the i5 9600KF or look into the AMD Ryzens before going into i7s or i9s.My build --> MoBo AsRock Z390 PRO4, GPU MSI Armor OC RX580 8G, RAM Vengeance LPX 2x8G 3200, SSD XPG SX8200 Pro 512G , HDD Seagate Barracuda 2TB, Case Rosewill Challenger S, Arctic Silver 5 and added 2 Noctua NF-S12A PWM (The Noctuas are overkill, ik, but I do not want to hear my GPU fans, ever!), Monitor AOC G2460VQ6. If you get yourself my build, if you can't use ethernet cable, do not forget to get a wifi adapter.PROS : Quality/Price is awesome. Depending on your build, I expect this CPU to be competent 5 to 7 years.CONS : It's not overclockable/unlocked (Can this really be seen as a con for 80% of people?)If you do not wish to go over 2666 on RAM, get a B360 MoBo. The 9100F is not overclockable and doesn't need a Z390 chipset otherwise. If you can get a RX590 for an extra CAN$25 or less, I recommend it. With the build I got, everything is always way below 60C and the GPU fans don't ever start. It's a pretty silent build. However, if you do not always play with a headset on, I recommend you change the Intel stock CPU fan for a more efficient and silent one. I'll personally change it for the Arctic 12 95W.",
