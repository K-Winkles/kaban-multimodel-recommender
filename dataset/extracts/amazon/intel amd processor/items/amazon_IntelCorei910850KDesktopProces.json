The cores are running nice and fast, very low heat is generated by the chip. The downside of this chip is the built in GPU, which is crap.It can run basic FHD or 4K displays, with good 2D performance and very basic 3D performance, but anyone who want computer with 10 core CPU will probably add some good grafics card to it.Installation recomandatiins:Use ESD protection and don't touch the pins of the chip or the socket.Watch for the correct alignment of the chip to the socket. It can go in only ione way, with zero insetion force. Don't force it in. Ever.Use good thermal paste between the chip and the cooler.When you close the lever of the chip holder, it marks two dots on top of the chip. This marks it as used.After installation, when you turn on the PC, make sure you enter the setup, and enable all the Intel advanced features that you would like to use. Some are off by default.",

                "reviewText": "I went from a 5820k to this beast... all I can say is WOW.The research I did indicated that this is basically Intel's flagship CPU, but a half of a small step down.One thing I didn't know about my 5820k was how much it was holding my entire system back.Passmark Benchmarks increased for EVERY component. My 5 year old RAM is now running in the 99th percentile. My 2070 Super isn't bottlenecked. Heck, even my crappy old SSD improved... but then was mercilessly replaced by an younger, sexier, far more modern NVME drive (hey, if you're going big, go BIG).Super happy with this. It's worth every penny. I'm still scratching my head as to how I paid less for this than my 5820k, and I bought that when they weren't even second gen anymore... and this is first gen hardware... but I supposed I can thank AMD for that... it helps when a \"little brother\" competitor suddenly outclasses you for less than you are charging... but hey, that works for us Intel fanboys, so we can get our fix for cheaper!!Only con is that under load, it kicks all my fans/cooling into high gear... but still runs butter smooth in most applications. Most of what I do primarily uses the GPU, but having a proper CPU matched to it makes a huge difference in all 3D applications I use. For reference, I've got it hooked up with a Corsair h100i radiator system, which seems to do the job well of cooling it. In this day and age, I can't imagine doing anything but liquid cooling on a high end processor.Now, when I can finally get my hands on that one 10GB super-amazing GPU that everyone has been wanting since September, and I've had reserved since then... I'll be in VR/Gaming/3D rendering/3D modeling heaven.",

                "reviewText": "I had an i7-7700k for 4-5 years, and when I got my 2080 Super I had to push that old i7 to a heavy overclock to get as much performance from it as I could. So I had been looking to upgrade my CPU for a while. Of course the debate came up if Ryzen was better or if Intel should even be considered. I'll admit, I still like Intel in my heart, but I wasn't getting 11th Gen, its expensive for basically no more performance. But the 10850k had come out just in the last year, for less than the 10900k but with the same performance. Mix that with it being cheaper with the 11th Gen announcements, and there being great looking and performing mobos for it (and 11th Gen) I bought this.Honestly, I gotta say, it does what it promises. It has 10 cores that can run like a beast. It has my 2080 Super performing at its best without the sweat and strain my 7700k had to. I had to push that 7700k to 5.2 Ghz, where I could feel it straining, to really see RTX gaming performance at its smoothest above 1080p. This 10850k boosted just from the base BIOS on my mobo to 4.8Ghz on all 10 cores and things are buttery smooth. I play Control at 1440p with maxed settings and get a fairly consistent 90 FPS and my temps and component usage are all nice and ideal levels. I was able to play Half-Life Alyx, and stream it while capturing my webcam footage without any temp issues and honestly hitting my VRAM cap on the GPU before any actual performance issues from bottlenecking.Honestly, I can't be happier with this purchase. I hate reviews without negatives, it feels fake. And I wish I had some, but seriously it is playing games I enjoyed before with far better performance at higher settings. It is handling my crazed multitasking and occasional streaming without a sweat. Ryzen 5000 series may be able to squeeze some better gaming performance overall than this. But at the price I got it, and the issues with availability of a 5800x (which is more expensive too) I couldn't say I'd be happier with that. Especially when the AMD motherboards don't look quite as nice either. My friend has a 5800x, I've played on his machine and heard from him in his own use that its good, but nothing there seemed to blow this 10850k out of the water.",

                "reviewText": "I was contemplating to wait for the amd 5000 series or go with this, and after amd released the prices...I am so glad I got this! This is an excellent cpu. It can handle just about anything you can throw at it and if you are not the overclocking type, thermal velocity boost will give you excellent performance right out of the box. Keep in mind, if you are a casual gamer, non power user, or someone who uses their pc for watching videos on YouTube this is overkill. Go for a zen2 ryzen 5 or 7 and you will be very happy. Also make sure to get a proper cooling solution, as this thing runs HOT!",

This CPU runs hot though compared to my previous build, and in my own opinion, the Noctua NH-U12A air/fan cooler is the perfect companion to keep the CPU as cool as possible. The i9-10850K is highly recommended to others - you will not be disappointed.",
