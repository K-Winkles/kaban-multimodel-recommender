                "reviewText": "It is a good CPU for an office build or budget based build. It works well enough for the day to day casual use, media consumption, surfing, good with Office docs and such. The integrated graphics are sufficient for your typical static screen stuff. Video playback on full screen for movies can show its limitations and the graphics on this model just hit the last supported driver update, but that really shouldn't matter.Using this for an office build that I already had most of the parts from upgrading another PC. This is more powerful than the mobile CPU I was using in the laptop. It is cool, quiet*, and 'good enough' to drive daily for now without feeling like I am waiting around. Certainly not the fastest thing around but expected performance level to skew and pricing. This one is cheaper than its slower 10100 counterpart and ever so slightly faster.*The stock fan coming with is a plus, but stock Intel fans, and particularly before the refresh are pretty terrible for performance and noise generation. It is not that I would suggest doing so, but I had a leftover Noctua low profile 92mm (fan) cooler that I put on this and it works REALLY well for it. The cooler cost nearly half the price of this i3 CPU, so I am not recommending you do so, per se...but ANY half decent aftermarket cooler is going to work better and be quieter while doing so.",

                "reviewText": "This is the entry level 11th gen CPU from Intel, but even with 32 GB of RAM and a good 500 GB SSD and nothing else, this is so slow it's taking 5 minutes from power on just to get a login screen in Windows 10.I upped to Windows 11 and that made it worse. It's like the CPU is not even trying.Similar complaints about these 11th gen are around, so opting for 10th gen i5.This CPU is essentially worthless.",
