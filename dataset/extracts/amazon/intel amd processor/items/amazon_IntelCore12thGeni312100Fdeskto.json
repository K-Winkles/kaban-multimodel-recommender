Overall I am damned happy with the upgrade, its not a top end gaming PC but its more than enough. I don't do competitive FPS games, RTX lighting is obnoxious as well as motion blur - basically purty graphics and good performance is what matters.That said the one complaint I do have falls on Amazon. You'd think that a processor would be packaged in a box with some protective wrapping right? Nope. Paper bag with no bubble wrap that also arrived torn. The fact that the RAM didn't fall out the hole and that the CPU works fine is a relief.",
