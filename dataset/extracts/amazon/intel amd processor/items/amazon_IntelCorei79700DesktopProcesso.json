                "reviewText": "Because video cards are so expensive this year, I could only update the RAM and CPU on my rig this year. I have an ASUS Z370-A motherboard and it\u2019s listed as compatible, but when I installed the new CPU the computer didn\u2019t boot. Troubleshooting said to update the BIOS which made sense because the BIOS I had was from 2018 before 9th gen Intel CPUs. Swapped the CPUs and updated the BIOS with the old CPU and then reinstalled the new CPU and it booted perfectly.- Be sure to update your BIOS before you install the new CPU- Only replace one thing at a time. I know it\u2019s more work to boot up in between, but if you replace RAM, too, you won\u2019t know what\u2019s not working if the boot fails.- Keep your old chip handy in case something goes wrong and you need to swap it out- Don\u2019t put too much conductive paste on the back. One instruction video said a drop about the size of a grain of rice. That seems right. Too much and it gets everywhere.Overall, installation was pretty easy. It took me a couple of tries to get the orientation correct, but it only fits on one way. The hardest part, really was finding and downloading the BIOS on the ASUS website and attaching the Coolermaster radiator and fan over the top.One note: This CPU comes with video but the HDMI out on the motherboard stopped working, It\u2019s not an issue because I use the HDMI and DVI out from a 1070 video card.Bottom line: it was a good upgrade. My games run moderately faster with better frame rate and nothing seems to be running hotter. I\u2019d recommend.",

My GPU is a GTX 1650 super. The processor was very easy to installed. This version came with a stocked Intel cooling fan with cooling gel pre-applied. After the drivers were installed I couldn't tell the difference at first while web browsing , watching movies, and non-VR games played just like with the i5. Were it shined was the VR games. The lag was almost completely gone with some graphical improvements on all games mentioned above. The graphics on auto settings still are low on some games and high on others because of my GPU, but the games played smoother. I would recommend for PCVR or video editing users but not for normal tasks like web browsing, movies, or normal gaming I would not recommend.",

I have this paired with 32gb\u2019s of 3000mhz speed Corsair vengeance ram and an msi z390 gaming carbon pro board, so I could turbo boost up to 4.7 via the motherboard bios but have left it at default settings.

The low TDP means that my small form factor build runs cool and quiet even when I've got things running full tilt. Sure, I might be able to buy a CPU that can be overclocked and squeak out a couple more percentage points of performance, but then I'd have to worry about heat. No thanks. This CPU rocks just the way it is. Highly recommended!",

The included cooler is really unintuitive to install - it was easy for sure but the supports have a weird twisting mechanism that is completely counter-intuitive (arrows out means tighten, arrows in means loose?). Besides that though she flies. Doesn't get too hot once you get a better cooler - I installed the included cooler until I got my new one and it was a bit loud and didn't do a great job cooling - though it is still sufficient you're gonna want something better :).",

                "reviewText": "If you're someone that's looking for a 9th series i7 here are some differences between the cpus that might not be as obvious.i7 9700- All core boost clock 4.4Ghz- Single core boost clock 4.7Ghz- Base core clock 3.0Ghz- 12MB Cache- TDP 65wi7 9700K (Stock)- All core boost clock 4.6Ghz- Single core boost clock 4.9Ghz- Base core clock 3.6Ghz- 12 MB Cache- TDP 95wSome things to keep in mindTDP ratings are done while the CPU is running at a sustained base clock speed, that would explain the TDP of the i7 9700K being much higher at 3.6Ghz base. This is a little misleading since clock for clock the cpus should perform the same and I feel like neither should be put under a stock intel cooler even though they might come with one.When I fit my i7 9700 the turbo power max defaulted to 65w this meant that under a 100% load the all core boost was only 3.8Ghz. The easiest way to change this is to download Intel XTU and turn up your Turbo Boost Power Max (I set mine to 150w making the CPU hit a TDP of around 100w) and now the all core boost sits at 4.4Ghz. Do this at your own risk and I beg you don\u2019t do this if you\u2019re using the stock cooler leave it at 65w, you have been warned.If you want to overclock you on have one choice, the i7 9700KIf you\u2019re not planning to overclock probably go for i7 9700",
