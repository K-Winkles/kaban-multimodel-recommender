                "reviewText": "This is a fully compliant Socket 1200 Intel chip and is compatible with both Z490 and Z590 systems.Power wise it is the weakest of all the CPUs (2 cores), but what it lacks in power it makes up for in price and to be used as a diagnostic/place holder CPU.I plan to use it to diagnose and repair Z490/Z590 motherboards and at such a great price (~$25) it is the type of CPU you stick on the shelf and forget about it till you need it.It even comes with a stock Intel cooler making it very easy to swap in quickly to systems and even bin some CPUs just placing it on top of a CPU for a quick boot.Outside of that? Maybe some basic use for a very non gaming / CPU intensive system. For gaming or anything CPU intensive, you will definitely want to look elsewhere.For anyone who is getting intermittent CPU error lights that tend to toggle between two colors in their diagnostic panel (Usually CPU and Memory error lights), it is most likely not the CPU but the fact this CPU only supports ~2666 memory. Your memory is most likely running at a faster speed either by default or has been set to its XMP profile. Make sure to completely reset your BIOS by removing your CMOS battery (or jumping the bios reset jumper) to clear all settings. Some G-5900 CPUs can support faster memory but it is not guaranteed as the rating is for 2666 only. Also make sure if it isn't booting to check your motherboard QVL list to make sure the memory is compatible with that motherboard and CPU.5/5",
