                "reviewText": "So I am no tech guru or anything. I cannot delve into the technical nuances of this cpu like some can. What I can tell you is this. The i9-13900k has significantly increased my productivity. Being able to run multiple CPU heavy applications completely changed the way I work. Yes I know this CPU runs notoriously hot, but it seems a good quality AIO tames it well. I have the 13900k running on an Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Master X motherboard with 128 gigs of ram and I use the NZXT Kraken 360 Elite to cool it. The Kraken Elite does manage the heat well and my systems idles at 28-29 degrees. This CPU is way overkill for a gamer, but for someone like me that does a lot of 3D modeling and rendering, its great. I do have the cpu slightly overclocked using the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility in automatic overclock. I have not had any crashes and havent noticed any thermal throttling at all with this setup.",

I have not experienced any of this since I knew exactly what settings needed adjusted in the BIOS to keep this monster CPU running cool. It seems that motherboard manufacturers tend to turn these up way past their limits by default and that was what caused all the issues. All you need to to is look up the specs for your CPU and setup the BIOS of your motherboard accordingly.I am using the Aorus Waterforce X 280 with Artic MX-6 Thermal Paste just in case you are curious. This has also been installed on the GIGABYTE Z790 AORUS Elite AX motherboard.As long as you set this up correctly you will not have any issues and will get a great performing CPU.",

Us\u00e9 una tarjeta ASUS Z690-F la cual NO reconoc\u00eda las memorias (Us\u00e9 64GB Corsair a 5200 MHZ), la m\u00e1quina simplemente no booteaba y quedaba encendida la luz naranja de la motherboard indicando problemas en DRAM, despu\u00e9s de leer mucho encontr\u00e9 que era necesario actualizar el BIOS desde la conexi\u00f3n trasera FLASHBACK, una vez hecho la operaci\u00f3n ha sido correcta y no he tenido mayores problemas. Instal\u00e9 un radiador de 120mm cooler master lite para controlar al procesador ya que por incre\u00edble que suene el KRAKEN x73 de 360mm no fue capaz de mantener a raya las temperaturas. El Cooler Master de 120mm mantiene al procesador sin carga o carga m\u00ednima entre los 32 y 40 grados y con carga m\u00e1xima y tests pega a los 80 grados, lo cual simplemente es genial teniendo en cuenta que la temperatura m\u00e1xima del Procesador es de 125 grados, al radiador le coloqu\u00e9 2 Ventiladores Noctua a 3000 revoluciones en configuraci\u00f3n push / pull. Tengo varios laboratorios de Linux / Oracle 12c y 19c en RAC usando GRID en almacenamiento y he levantado 6 m\u00e1quinas virtuales (3 RACs) trabajando de manera excelente y con velocidades de respuesta mucho m\u00e1s que excelentes, por lo cual recomiendo ampliamente el procesador i9 Gen 13th para cualquier necesidad que se tenga, fel\u00edz con mi compra, al momento de comprarlo el costo fue alrededor de 600 d\u00f3lares!!",
