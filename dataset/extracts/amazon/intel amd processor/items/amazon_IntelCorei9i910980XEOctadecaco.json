Works well, 36 cores are going to be useful to run several VMs. Single thread it's not much faster than the 7900x that it replaced, maybe 10%. Not as fast at my threadripper, but close, maybe if I tinker with OC parameters, I can get more out of it, but primarily I wanted more cores, and 36 is certainly more than 20. Is it worth the 1k, probably not, but only enough it's a simpler config with a sage 10g motherboard than trying to repurpose the threadripper setup.",

During the covid year, I saved all my loot to put these items together. I still saving to upgrade my GPU. This CPU rocks. It's worth the loot. And I am sure for years to come I won't need a new one for a while. Unless star trek type computers start to show up that is.....Look, I am not a rocket scientist or anything like that. I mainly use my PC to run my rented game servers, play games, do a little photo shop, etc. I will NEVER need 18 cores for what I do. But the old saying \"Better to have and not need, then need and not have\" applies here. Plus you can overclock this sucker that rivals 2022 cpu's, and do it with ease, if you're into that sort of stuff. I recommend it for sure.",

                "reviewText": "I managed to snag one off of Newegg. The 10980xe is an 18 core monster that is just a revision from the 7980xe and the 9980xe. This cpu still drops into x299 boards and behaves almost identically to the 7980xe and 9980xe with the exception of slightly higher stock clocks. The major selling point is the price with a massive 50% off of the original MSRP of the 9980xe.The skylake-x mesh architecture suffers compared to cometlake's(10900k) ringbus in gaming applications. You will actually lose performance in gaming compared to a 10900k. The 10980xe does bring more cores along with the features that come with the x299 platform making it a great workstation.I consider the 18 core 10980xe a good core count and feature set in between the 5950x and threadripper. Although the 16 cores from the 5950x are much more powerful, they are limited by the AM4 socket with only dual channel memory and limited pcie lanes.The overclocking headroom on the 10980xe is incredible. With ambient water cooling(420mmx38mm aio) I can hit 5ghz across all 18 cores and stay under 90c. The heat at these clocks are unmanageable with your typical 360mmx27mm aio and a full custom loop is strongly recommended if you intend to overclock. As always with overclocking, your results may vary.The 10980xe has a something for everyone. 48 pcie lanes, quad channel memory, 18 cores 36 threads, avx512, high overclocking potential, and games quite well when you bump up the mesh/cache speed.",
