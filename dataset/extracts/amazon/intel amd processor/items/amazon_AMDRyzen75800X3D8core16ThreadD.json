                "reviewText": "I upgraded from a 5600 to a 5800x3d and later bought an aftermarket CPU cooler to run lower temps during summer and for higher gaming performance.This upgrade was massive for me for gaming as that is my main focus and hobby on my desktop. With the AMD 5000x series drivers for my bios already installed this was plug-and-play for me.Gaming performance hit my target 144hz on my 1440p monitor in most games with reduced settings as framerate is my go-to in fast-paced games like FPS. I do occasionally reduce framerate in single-player games or games that are isometric to reduce gpu/cpu load and get more consistent frame-times when upping graphic settings. I would recommend this in most cases for the majority of gamers but this is still my preference.Performance is SMOOTH and I do mean buttery smooth for me. The change in the 1% lows was immediately felt by me, but take this with a grain of salt especially if you are less experienced with high framerates/stutters and not a major PC enthusiast. Most people will game at 1080p on lower refresh rates, but please try to take this CPU to at least 1440p 90-120hz for optimal experience.COOLER - I kept my wraith cooler from my older 5600 to start while I researched what cooler I wanted to go with but I did game on this cooler for over a month. The wraith cooler was more than sufficient in most scenarios but due to the summer heat, and more demanding games my CPU temps were going above 80C and causing my room to get hotter and some CPU throttling requiring more tampering with settings and research into curve optimization. Much of my room heat comes from my PC due to it being closed, but it is an older house, a lightly insulated wooden home, with 5 windows, along with a mini-fridge and a bathroom that seems to absorb heat from somewhere. This temp was not ideal for me due to my room often being above 80F and during the heatwaves and AC work done up to 88 or higher in my room.COOLER Pt 2 - To reduce my room heat and reduce CPU thermal throttling I purchased an aftermarket CPU cooler with 6 heat pipes. This dramatically reduced my CPU thermal throttling reducing my average temps by 10-20F which also reduced temps on my GPU. The cooler I bought was around 40-50 bucks so if you are interested that is more than enough to cool this CPU for its lifetime.Curve Optimizer(WARNING!! this may void your warrant) - When using a curve optimizer with this CPU you will see a sizeable increase in performance and thermal temps. You can use a no-update manual optimizer like PBO2 Tuner or research into making it always optimized with bios settings. Idle temps get the most benefit from this and second is when performing at medium-high load in my experience. Idle temps were 5-10F reduced and medium-high load temps were in a similar range and sometimes far better due to increased CPU performance as well.This CPU is an incredible value for anyone that is enthusiastic about gaming performance. Be aware that there is a newer generation of x3D cpus but the current dollar-to-dollar value for 7000x3d cpus is not close enough to consider for anyone that does not want a maxed-out expensive system.On sale, the 5800x3d CPU is an absolute NO-BRAINER for gaming, but please be aware you need to buy a cooler, and you may need a bios update PRIOR to installing your CPU if you do not already have an AMD 5000 series CPU. If the 7000x3d series goes on sale and you are building an entirely new system, you should be aware of RAM costs and Motherboard costs as well as this can be a dramatic price differential for cheaper system builds if you are not careful.",

                "reviewText": "All I can say is, if you are planning to stick to AM4 for a while, this CPU is simply amazing for gaming!I replaced a 2700X with this, Best choice I made. The performance is just incredible compared to others in the AM4 line. My room-mate has a 5800X and nearly the same exact specs as my PC and the difference in gaming is pretty noticeable between the two. It does lack slightly in productivity compared to the 5800X, but this is meant more for gaming, and that it does VERY well.If you are a serious gamer on the AM4 platform, you simply can't go wrong! This is simply the best AM$ gaming CPU on the market.",

                "reviewText": "What is there to say that already hasn't been said? This processor is the end all be all for gaming on AM4. Few things I wanted to mention. The general consensus is that this chip runs \"hot\". Make sure your case has proper airflow(not just a million fans in it) and you get a CPU cooler that works well(Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE is an amazing cooler regardless of it being on the cheaper side).My two cents about Amazon - I really appreciate the same-day delivery on Christmas Eve. Your driver was great and even brought the package to my door(good thing I was home). The only thing that could be better is the packing. Both my CPU cooler(big and heavy) and my processor were packed in a very thin plastic bag. This isn't a great idea for very sensitive computer parts.",

Absolutely no bottlenecking with a 4070ti and 32 gig 3600mhz ram. It was a great buy! Performs great with ASE and ASA for those Ark fans. High frame rate @1080p. Decent frame rate @1440. I normally run 1440 with medium to high settings with no issues any kind related to graphics.",

Es ist die schnellste CPU f\u00fcr einen AM4 Sockel und da er vor allem einen gro\u00dfen Cache hat, auch auf alten Boards mit langsamen DDR4 RAM schnell. Dadurch richtet er sich vor allem an Gamer. Allerdings ist er wesentlich teurer als der 5800X und nur maximal 10 % schneller bei CPU intensiven Spielen. Normale Nutzer und Casual Gamer werden den Unterschied kaum bemerken. Sie sollten \u00fcberlegen, ob sie das Modell ohne 3D w\u00e4hlen.",
