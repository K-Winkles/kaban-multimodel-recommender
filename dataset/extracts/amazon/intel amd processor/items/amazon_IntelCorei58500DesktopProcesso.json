Also remember that Microsoft and Intel are trying to STOP PEOPLE FROM USING OLDER OPERATING SYSTEMS, actually putting impedences in the CPUs to not run those operating systems anymore.Intel i5-8500 is stable, great speed and base clock at 3 GHz ramps up to 3.99 GHz without tweaking any profiles.My Setup:MSI MAG B365M MORTARIntel i5-8500MSI Geforce GTX 1050ti(2x) WD Blue HDD 1TB**All I want to do is use photoshop and emulate PS2 games.

The i5-8500 with 6 cores and 630 Igpu has done its job with my plex server and runs at a cool 94/106 Fh. I did not use the stock cooler, however, instead, I used the Noctua NH-L9x65, Premium Low-Profile CPU Cooler (65mm, Brown) found here on Amazon. The 6 cores are more than enough to serve files and the i9 9900K is back to a safe place in another pc. I hope this helps someone. Good luck and Godspeed.",
