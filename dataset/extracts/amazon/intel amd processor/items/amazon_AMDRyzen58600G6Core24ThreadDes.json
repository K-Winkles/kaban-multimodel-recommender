While its a great product I was hoping for much better performance especially since this is about 3 years newer than the prior 5600g. The CPU performance passmark score is 25,957, with the prior 5600g having a 19,902 score. The GPU side was definitely oversold with many people saying that it was equivalent to a GTX 1060 (passmark 10,081). It's not even close, it's about 50% slower than my old 1060 in terms of FPS in most of the games I've tested (the igpu 760M has a passmark of 5,760). I'm just surprised with the lack of performance uplift when you consider this is on a 4nm node. I like the product, but in hindsight I may have been expecting too much.",

                "reviewText": "This is the value version of the 8000 Ryzen series. The 8000 series is mostly the same as the 7000 series, but with a better/more GPU performance.The 8700G, is the 8 core CPU one which essentially has a built in 1650 class GPU. The 8600G is the mid range 6core one with 33% GPU less performance. Or for those bad at math, the 8700G has 50% more performance than the 8600G GPU.There's not a compelling reason to upgrade a 7600 cpu to the 8600G, and the 5700G isn't (much slower, at CPU stuff) than the 8700G, but the GPU net improvement is up to 300%. Check out the 7840HS mini computer's if you think you will never spend $200+ on just a graphics card.Don't compare these 65 watt CPUs against 65-130+Watt CPUs that ALSO have a 200-300Watt graphics card.They're great.",
