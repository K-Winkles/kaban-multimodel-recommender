                "reviewText": "Got this during Black Friday 2019 for $160. It was an unbeatable deal. I just looked at the R5 3600 like \"sorry buddy, I want you but lol...they're making it difficult.\" I know they usually say the extra 2 cores work well for streaming so I did some twitch streaming @60fps 720p high video bitrate over wifi just to see how it handled it. Had several of my friends tune in including myself from another device. Stream was flawless. Meanwhile the game I was running was Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown. 1440p, completely maxed out graphics locked at 60fps. Didn't check the results without a cap while streaming but I know that when I was playing off stream and removed the cap I was getting like 170fps. I paired it up with a Sapphire Nitro+ 5700XT. It's a match made in heaven and the RGB of both the CPU and GPU are glorious.I've yet to find any reason to overlcock this CPU. It destroys everything I throw at it. Afterburner shows that the CPU handles itself nicely, boosting up to 4.2Ghz when it needs to, and coming back down to 3.7Ghz. I've never seen it hit 4.3Ghz on its own but like I said, when all your games get FPS like that at stock with those resolutions & graphics settings, what's the point? Emulators get devoured too. Wii U, PS3, Wii/GameCube, PS2 etc, just straight devoured. Breath of the Wild running at 4K@60 like.....\"WASSUP?\" Not to mention CEMU 1.17.1 is dropping very soon and we're gonna see an even bigger boost in performance for AMD users. I always see the argument about \"get the R7 2700X over the R5 3600 only if you stream\". No bro, just get it cuz it's cheaper, has more cores, and has a monster heatsink. The gaming performance you're gonna lose is extremely negligent. Check out the testers on youtube.Speaking of heatsink, almost forgot the temps. I use a NZXT H510 with only the default exhaust fan setup. No extra case fans. I just tweaked the fan curves of the case, cpu and gpu slightly to my liking. Not enough for noise to be an issue either. I live in the Caribbean, it's dry season at the moment, so it's hot as hell. No AC in my room. My temps never go above 70c while gaming....so it's pretty safe to say the heatsink is doing its job. I was expecting more heat with a cramped case like mine and that monster AMD gpu (you know AMD looooves some toast action), but everything's actually running cool. This CPU/Heatsink combo man, there's just so much to love and so much money to save. Gotta love it lol.",

                "reviewText": "When I saw these go on sale for 160 I had to pick one up and get a new build going. My previous PC had an AMD FX 6300, so upgrading from that to this Ryzen 7 is pretty amazing.The 6300 could handle most of what I wanted to do, but this Ryzen handles it with ease and does more. Constant 60fps with 1440p and some games in 4k with good framerates paired with the RX 580, and down the line I plan to upgrade GPUs to get better performance since I'm sure it can do better. Nearly instant boot times when paired with an M.2 NVMe drive, and most processes are a breeze.The Wraith spire was very easy to install on the ASUS Strix B450-F since it went directly on the brackets that were already on the motherboard (which was great since the coolers I've installed in the past have been a pain in comparison), looks pretty with the LEDs and runs relatively well from what I can gather.My only concern is the temps on this CPU, and to my understanding the main difference with X models is that they come overclocked, and I imagine that's why the temps are high. Of course, the 6300 with an aftermarket cooler rarely went over 100\u00b0F and that's the CPU I've had for a while, so I was a bit surprised to see the temps show up at 130-140\u00b0F while idling. According to some posts I've seen this is the normal for the 2700X, and it does make sense since it is more powerful and comes overclocked in comparison to the CPUs I've had more experience with.Thankfully even though it does run hot it doesn't get much hotter, my temps haven't really gone over 155\u00b0F while gaming or performing tasks, and the max is about 185\u00b0F. The usage percent hasn't gone above 40 for most of my regular gaming and tasks either, which is impressive.It's a great CPU to get, especially while it's on sale for around $160.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars I'm very happy with my decision to upgrade",
                "reviewText": "I just upgraded from a 1700X to a 2700X. With stock clocks, under a full load, the 2700X clock speeds (4Ghz) are 500Mhz faster than with my 1700X (3.5Ghz). And DDR4 memory speed was able to be increased from 2933 to 3200Mhz using 4 x 8GB DDR4 modules. Both of these improvements made the upgrade worth it to me. Turn on Gaming Mode through the use of AMD Ryzen Master Utility and CPU clock speeds increase dynamically up to 4.3Ghz! Needless to say, AMD has outdone themselves this time. I'm very happy with my decision to upgrade :DPROs- Price for performance can't be beat vs. 1st gen Ryzen and existing Intel CPUs; i.e. the 2700X is $30 cheaper than a 8700K- Backward compatible with X370 and B350 motherboards (with the right BIOS update)- Noticeable higher clock speeds vs. 1700X, especially under full load - up to 500Mhz faster clock speeds!- Precision Boost 2.0 and XFR2 are built into the CPU, which means these features are intact and work even with an older X370 motherboard- Improved compatibility with higher DDR4 memory speeds vs. 1700X- Operating temperatures are about the same in spite of the fact the CPU having a 10W higher TDP rating vs. 1700X- AMD's Ryzen Master Utility really does work!- Wraith Prism CPU cooler is included and is adequate for stock CPU speedsCONs- Very limited overclocking headroom unless extreme cooling is used; i.e. LN02- Anticipated future release of the higher clocked 2800X variant may cause buyer's remorse to those that just bought a 2700X- Motherboard related and not really an issue of the 2700X; the X470 chipset is not really an improvement in most areas and features vs. the X370 chipset- Best DDR4 memory speeds can only be achieved by using 2 of the 4 DIMM slots; 3666Mhz has been achieved with 2 memory sticks, but only 3200Mhz has been achieved using 4 memory sticks- No native increase in supported PCI-E lanes (24) from the CPU (not including X470 or the upcoming Z490 chipset improvements)Bottom line, is it worth upgrading to the 2700X? It all depends on what PC hardware you have now and how you want to spend your money. For example, if you own a GTX1060 or RX 570, a GPU upgrade will most likely give you a much better performance increase than upgrading from a 1700X to a 2700X. But, if you have a PC that's 5 years or older, I would say it might be worth upgrading if you have a need for multitasking on your computer. If you game, stream, play music, while running hardware monitoring tools all at the same time, then the 2700X is definitely for you!",

                "reviewText": "What a processor !!! Just loved it. It's been 6 months, I made my home PC with AMD Ryzen 7 2700X purchased through Amazon. I feel like I am using a server, not a home PC. I LOVE it's Power. I run 3 - 4 VM windows machine on top of it, do lots of R&D, make flowless graphics editing. Loved it's overclocking. But ofcourse not only the processor, I am using all other great components like M.2 NVRAM SSD, C15 memory etc... I am not a gamer, so can't talk about that segment, but ofcourse CPU fan light is very attractive though it does not make any difference to me but my family and kids loved that. Initially I was worried about its power consumptuon, but I found it does not take much power with low processing load, once we increase the load, it takes more wattage. CPU fan is very quite during low processing, as I increase the processing load, Fan moves faster hence create some noice, but thats accaptable, atleast much lower noice than a server. Base Win10 takes around 60 watt, as I power on each VM, 10 - 12 watt increases. Base Win 10 with some graphics processing takes around 75 to 80 watt. During Extreme processing, it takes 100 watt or more",

                "reviewText": "Provengo da un Intel i5-6600K e da quando uso computer, ovvero da quasi 20 anni, sono sempre rimasto fedele ad Intel, in quanto garanzia di maggior qualit\u00e0 e consideravo le CPU AMD, anche se buone in termini di prestazioni e prezzo, non all'altezza della concorrenza soprattutto per problemi incompatibilit\u00e0 software (dovuto spesso ai famigerati chipset VIA, spesso utlizzati nelle schede madri per CPU AMD). Per\u00f2 negli ultimi mesi vedendo l'esagerato rincaro dei prezzi delle CPU Intel, leggendo le buone recensioni e opinioni da parte di moltissimi utenti, nonch\u00e9 consultando diversi test prestazionali, ho avuto tutti gli elementi necessari per rivalutare questo produttore. Quindi ho deciso di acquistare un Ryzen 2700x. Non sono un videogiocatore e quindi il cosiddetto vantaggio che Intel ha sul singolo core rispetto AMD (soprattutto utile in ambito videogames, poich\u00e9 raramente si vanno da usare oltre 4 cores) non m'interessa. I principali utilizzi che ne faccio computer sono la grafica 3D e la virtualizzazione: due ambiti dove meglio si sfruttano le CPUs con tanti cores.Quindi trovo questa CPU molto valida, un abbisso in confronto all'i5 che avevo poc'anzi (solo 4 cores e per giunta senza HT).L'unico disappunto, se cos\u00ec possiamo chiamarlo, \u00e8 stato il dissapatore stock venduto con la CPU, ovvero il Wraith Prism RGB. Dai stress test effettuati, considerando che deve dissipare una CPU con 105 W di TDP, fa un egregio lavoro (almeno a confronti dei dissipatori stock forniti da Intel per le sue CPUs), tenendo temperature che non vanno oltre i 69-70\u00b0C in media (anche se per 1 min ha raggiunto i 75\u00b0C). Per\u00f2 con la sua ventola che va oltre i 3600 rpm \u00e8 davvero rumoroso, almeno secondo il mio udito: quando la ventola gira sotto i 500-600 rpm \u00e8 silenzioso, ma oltre sembra quasi un piccolo aspirapolvere. Quindi l'ho sostituito con un dissipatore della Noctua, il NH-U12S, che oltre a raffreddarmi maggiormente la CPU (sotto stress test dopo oltre 40 minuti, la temperatura non \u00e8 mai salita oltre i 64\u00b0C) e veramente silenzioso (con velocit\u00e0 della ventola sui 1250 rpm sotto stress test). Tali test sono stati effettuati con impostazioni stock e senza effettuare overclock manuali.Edit: L'ho abbinato a scheda madre MSI X470 Gaming Pro e 64 GB di RAM Corsair Vengeance LPX da 3000 Mhz e non ho avuto alcun problema di incompatibilit\u00e0: ho attivo l'XMP (in quanto appena installate il BIOS vedeva le RAM alla frequenza 2133 Mhz) e ho elevato la frequenza della memorie a 2800 Mhz (non sono salito sino a 3000 in quanto ho letto in giro che ci potrebbero essere problemi di stabilit\u00e0 se non si alza anche il voltaggio).",
