                "reviewText": "Installed fine. My MSI motherboard wants to run it at the power levels it would for a K processor. And it actually works fine, just gets hot really fast. As seen under HWMonitor, it will hit the 100 degree thermal throttle limit when any significant benchmark program is run. I worked around this by changing the cooler profile in the MSI bios from \"liquid\" to either \"tower air\" or \"box\". \"Box\" profile changes the automatic PL1 and PL2 settings to run as the i9-13900 non-K spec limits. For a little overclocking performance, I set \"tower air cooling\" mode in the bios and experimented with slightly lower PL1 and PL2 settings as well as lowering the throttle limit from 100 to 95 degrees. Works great now.",
