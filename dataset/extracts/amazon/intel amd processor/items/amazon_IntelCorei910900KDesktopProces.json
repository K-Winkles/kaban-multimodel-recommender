                "reviewText": "I bought 3 of these to build 3 systems at the same time. They all function fine and hit the advertised speeds, when it's not thermal throttling itself. This generation has far less overclocking headroom then previous generations of intel hedt non x299 cpus so hitting that silicon lottery really does matter. Seeing the differences between 3 shows how far this platform had been pushed by intel, as with each chip you expect there to be some variance but these have far more then any of the pervious generations I've overclocked and I've been doing this since you had to change a crystal to get an overclock. Hopefully Alder Lake will be a whole lot better, but this is still a decent cpu for the money. Be sure to use good cooling, even at stock frequencies it does need to be well cooled to keep it under the thermal throttle point and TVB/TAU limits.",

Tested with Cinebench R23 10 minutes runs, it stays under 85C and then comes back to under 30C very fast. Intel Extreme Tuning Utility stress tests stay under 80C. Light load (e-mail, internet browsing, etc) runs at ~7C over room temperature. A 30 megapixels DSLR raw image gets converted in less than 5 seconds. No problem with USB and SATA storage devices (have more than 6 attached). Very happy with this CPU and zero regrets not going with a newer version.",

                "reviewText": "Edited after exactly 1 month of use:THIS CPU IS A BEAST!!! IT RUNS EVERYTHING. With a good Cooler, Thermal Paste, and Case with good airflow it runs around 25-27\u00b0 degrees doing normal stuff like navigating, and 32-38\u00b0C playing. Haven't got mayor temperatures playing games but it also depend on what are you playing. For example is not the same playing 2D than 3D or Open-World games. Have been playing shooters, GTA V and 2D platformers. One time I rendered a model on blender and it went to 60\u00b0C but it was a one time thing, also I was using the integrated graphics (UHD 630) so the CPU couldn't resist that much. With a decent GPU runs smoothly.Anyway... What are you waiting to buy this?First of all, I must clarify that I've bought directly from 'amazon.com' and not any other third party store.At first I was a little worried that the box would come with that square shape and not with the fancy one, but doing some research I realized that after the next generation intel came out, they simplified the 10th generation box so no problem with that, also it's just a box so who really cares.By the way I checked the CPU thoroughly and it doesn't have any details, it's completely new and it came with all its certification, stamps, even its manual and everything well sealed and no fingerprints anywhere.To finish, the package was intact and very well protected. I could buy again here. 10 out of 10, four spoons, A+, a regular.. tomato? \ud83c\udf45 Whatever that means.. VERY NICEU CAESAR-CHAN!!.... I'm sorry, forget that.Finally, nice product. Thank you Amazon for everything!",

The only negative is the relatively high price, but if you're wanting one, you should be willing to pay for one. It would be amazing to get it cheaper, but you definitely get top notch performance with the possibility of turbocharging it to north of 5 GHz!",

I have a Noctua air cooler on this and never once have I had any overheating issues after hours of gameplay or stress tests. 10/10 would recommend to anyone or everyone who\u2019s considering.",

I was reallyimpressed by it. Also the cpu was running at more than 4GHz, nearly 5, so I didn't even want to OC it because it was already good enough.
