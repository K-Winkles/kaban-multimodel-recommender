                "reviewText": "If you're looking to build a mid-range system and either don't need dedicated graphics or are waiting for the prices of graphics cards to return to the realm of sanity, this CPU is an excellent option, especially if paired with a B560 motherboard. If you are planning on using a separate graphics card, check out the cheaper i5-11400F. While the upper tiers of the newly-released 11th Gen Rocket Lake have received criticism for poor value relative to 10th Gen and poor performance relative to Ryzen 5000 series, the 11400 is a solid value. It's a solid improvement over the 10400, and it is currently extremely difficult to acquire AMD processors with integrated GPUs.Quick review of Intel nomenclature: An \"F\" designates a CPU without integrated graphics. \"K\" designates an unlocked CPU that allows overclocking. So the 11400 is a locked CPU with integrated graphics, while the 11400F is a locked CPU that will require a separate graphics card.All Intel CPUs (even non-K ones) technically allow for *memory* overclocking, just not overclocking the CPU itself. However, previously, their B-series motherboards prevented memory overclocking, limiting RAM speeds to 2933MHz, and you had to buy an expensive Z-series board to use faster RAM.But with the 11th Gen, the B560 motherboards now support memory overclocking, thus improving the performance of budget and mid-range systems. So a system built with an 11400F and B560 motherboard represents an excellent value. If you don't need a GPU, or want to wait for prices to come down, getting an 11400 and using the integrated graphics is a very compelling option.",

                "reviewText": "Well, this is a pretty bad time to be a pc gamer. On top of the chip shortages, scalpers, and crypto mining craze, you can't even find a decent cpu with integrated graphics that plays modern games for less than $400... until now.Intel's 11th generation Core processors are pretty lackluster, however, they do have one thing going for them. The integrated graphics is good enough to play most esports titles @ 720p and medium settings over 60 fps. Not only that, it also comes priced under $200 and you can actually buy it.I was able to use this paired with the ASRock B560m Pro4/ac and 3200Mhz CL16 RAM to get a very nice system setup. ASRock let's the CPU stay clocked at 4.2-4.4Ghz at all times which is nice. I was also able to undervolt the vCore by -100mV and the temps came down good enough. Max load power consumption hits around 85-90 watts. Using the Aresgame River 5 cpu cooler, temps sit at 28C idle and 52C max load.I really can't find anything negative to say about this processor, it will definitely last you for several years once you get a graphics card. Until you do, the iGPU will at least let you play some games.",
