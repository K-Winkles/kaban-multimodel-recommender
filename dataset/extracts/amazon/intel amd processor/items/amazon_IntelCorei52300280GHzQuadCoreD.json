One of the biggest selling points for me going through Amazon was the 100% refund 30 day return policy, which almost no online computer retailer can match. Also, the price was very similar to all other online retailers I considered, plus free shipping. So, free shipping, no restocking fee, and same price as everyone else.The processor unit arrived in its factory packaging as shown in the main picture. It arrived with a factory aluminum/copper heatsink with a fan that is very quiet. This unit is quiet enough for my music production needs, so I don't even need to buy special coolers to keep it quiet. The cooler actually has the thermal grease stuck on it already, so you don't have to mess with any grease paste bottles.The unit's performance is excellent. I love seeing all four CPUs in the Task Manager performance graphs. I can play older games and MMO games without a video card. Playing videos in high def is no problem at all, even without a video card. I run Windows XP. I run a virtual PC sometimes too, and I don't see any issues.",
