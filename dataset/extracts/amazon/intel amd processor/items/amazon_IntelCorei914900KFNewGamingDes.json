                "reviewText": "I guess everyone is right, these things are hot and then some. I went with a off brand AIO, and for the most part I'm good. It does get spicy when I'm rendering or doing some crazy multi tasking.Gaming seems fine, no issues. I play all kinds of games, FPS, MMO's, survival, etc. (Paired with a Gigabyte Gaming 4090 OC, Tforce 64 gigs 6000 M/T DDR5, samsung 990 pro NVME 2 tb x2, no OCing done by me.)I replaced a 5950x, which was having issues for some reason, just felt like it was getting slower and slower, thermal paste and heat were fine on it, never got over 60c with the beefier AIO I had on it. Just took longer and longer to render things. I guess I wore it out!I just think you'll want a good AIO, and/or a solid water cooling solution for this to really get the best out of it. I'm not sure a air cooled option will do you any good, but hey I've been wrong many times, so there might be something that can handle the job.All in all, not bad, but it's not going to give you much performance boost over last gen, matter of fact I found out later 13700k beats it in a lot of tests, blargh! Either way, its fast, and it runs everything great, so I'm happy till the next go around.",

                "reviewText": "I was using a 10700K. I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch.I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it.If you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money. For an i7 system though, this is an excellent CPU and a half decent upgrade over the previous gen.",
