                "reviewText": "The Ryzen 5 4600G is a good budget choice for several reasons. 1.) It has an integrated GPU so if you don't want to use a GPU, you don't have to. That being said, you're not getting much better than E-Sports with this integrated GPU. But if that's all you're looking for, then it may be up your alley.2.) The price. I got mine for $99 flat and that's a great price full stop. 3.) Compatibility. This chip is compatible with many many AM4 motherboards. 4.) The performance. You should see performance that's only about 5% slower than a Ryzen 5 3600. I think you will have a hard time noticing that in 99% of situations. 5.) It sips power. Right now the max I have seen it use a max of 39 watts, and that's at 100% load. So I'm not sure if I need to put it under some sort of synthetic load or something to get it to hit 65W, but it's been really awesome so far.I recommend this processor wholeheartedly for people on a budget. If you can afford a 5600, the 5600X or higher, you should get it since they are faster, have more cache, and support things like PCI Express 4.0. But overall just a really good processor for the money.",

It was an upgrade (along with motherboard), replacing an A8-7600 which would have worked fine if Microsoft hadn't killed Dual Graphics when they killed Win7...anyway, it's also quite a bit faster than my Ryzen 5-2400G was, though the clock rate doesn't show it. I'd recommend this for gaming IF you could assign more than 2Gb of dedicated GPU RAM but you can't, that I'm aware of. This processor will handle moderate gaming on Low to Medium settings depending on the game, just don't expect to run Starfield with it.",

                "reviewText": "Pros- If you're wanting to run a 1080p/1440p gaming build this is your CPU, look no further- Runs cool with the Be Quiet! CPU cooler, stays below 30C with it on stock settings- Is overclockable to 4.2 out of the box, I changed it straight to 4.2 without adjusting voltage, or the BIOS did it for me, and it has no issues; but definitely runs 15% faster than it did. With the overclock it still remains under 45C during stress tests and intense gaming sessions, so it's doing it's job phenomenally- Integrated Graphics Card is nice for running a second monitor during gaming sessionsCons- Default CPU Cooler is trash, I wouldn't use it for gaming; it takes up a ton of space and especially where it counts by scaling horizontally right off the start which inhibits access or airflow to things on the board.Overall- I'd buy again, if you're spending more than $300 on a GPU then do yourself a favor and get a better CPU. This isn't going to run your GPU or other components well if it's the cheapest component in your build by a mile. But for a Budget Gaming Build running something along the lines of a AMD RX 6600 you'll be golden",

                "reviewText": "Cheapness, XMP capabilities, low power usage, and having a bundled cooler (assuming no overclocking) are its most positive aspects, but keep in mind this CPU uses PCIe 3.0 lanes! This will not matter in most use cases except playing the most recent gaming titles at max settings, but you shouldn't be getting this CPU in the 1st place if that's your goal. Has served me perfectly fine so far, but I recommend a 5600 (non-G) or even a 3600 over this to avoid any PCIe version bottlenecking in the future (e.g. using newer low-end graphics cards that use PCIe 4.0x4 lanes like the 6500 XT).",
