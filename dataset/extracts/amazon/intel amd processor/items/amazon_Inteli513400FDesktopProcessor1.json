                "reviewText": "So I was stuck on Windows 10 with my LGA 1151 core i7-6700. This processor at an affordable price more than doubled, maybe tripled my cpu performance while still accepting my older DDR4 3200 ram and m.2 storage. Also allows me to update my machine to Windows 11 as a 13th gen cpu. I considered running 8th gen chip in my older mother board by flashing the bios with a coffee lake chip support, but rather than deal with all the isolation on the cpu pins and bios frustration, i opted to spend 60 bucks for a new MATX board and this cpu. The only complaint I have is the cpu box was clearly opened and I am left wondering if this was dropped into someone else's board at some point and returned. I don't like that when the product is being advertised as new. The seller was Amazon LLC too so I am not sure what is going on with that. I have half a mind to return it for a replacement but alas it is installed and seems to be running fine so I really don't want to pack it up and ship it back. My chip runs pretty cool with the stock fan, 3d mark cpu stress tests never took it above 71C but that fan sure kicked in when the cpu was running at 100% utilization. At idle on my computer the chip purrs along at 30-35C with the fan running somewhere around 40%. All in all a good purchase to get my machine ready for Win 11. Will work for a budget gaming build but expect to pay a little more for a good GPU.",
