The last two were Intel builds, my previous being an i7 4790. Yeah, seven years ago. I had some money, and a wife who agreed the upgrade was necessary, and off we went. So good to meet the UPS man at the door, or in the front yard for several days in a row. Neighbors were jealous. It was just as much as a blink of yer eye's worth of effort to install this CPU. It really felt weighty and substantial in the figglers. The build went off without a hitch, and she's running now. Before, the Bluestacks launch would take about 30 seconds to load. Now???? It's done in about 5.8 seconds! That's fast! I see the differences in speed on several fronts, and it's very nice to command. Thank you, Intel, for another winner in the CPU dept.",

                "reviewText": "Leaving out all of the typical troubleshooting you would normally do with a custom build, the only real problem I had was windows selecting a balanced power profile automatically on startup after I got everything put together and running. The balanced power profile was causing the 10700kf to perform sporadically in my recording software (Studio One 5 Pro) and led to power throttling in the Intel extreme tuning utility. Deleting the balanced profile so that windows was forced to use high performance or extreme performance seemed to fix the issue. So far I haven't been able to overload the cpu in any applications. Overclocked to a solid 5.0ghz. Very happy with the performance I get out of this cpu.",

This processor is lightning fast and handles multiple applications with ease. As someone who enjoys playing games on their computer, I've been particularly impressed with the seamless gaming experience that this processor provides. The fact that it has 8 cores and 16 threads means that it can handle even the most demanding applications without breaking a sweat. I would highly recommend the Intel Core i7-10700KF to anyone looking for a high-performance processor that can handle everything from gaming to video editing with ease.",

                "reviewText": "Replacing a legend is always bittersweet, but, the Prime day 2021 deal on i7-10700KF was enough to push me onward. Getting a decade of solid performance from i5-2500K @ 4.2GHz is amazingly cost effective. I've always had zero issues with any Intel cpu I've used (and also the AMD one's I've used in the past).The 10700KF fired right up with one of those ginormous Noctua sinks. Great thermals and performance. Not overclocking and not sure I need to. But may tinker a bit down the road. Nice to have that option if necessary. Looking to get another decade down the road ....",

                "reviewText": "At the time of writing this review I picked this up for 280CAD. Given that the other AMD ones were at least twice the cost, I got this one specifically cause I game and have an RTX 3070. For the cost of 500$ I got a motherboard and CPU to upgrade from my old 6700k. That's still less than JUST the AMD CPU's in the same category. This works well for gaming and for video editing even. Theres a lot of hype around AMD, and yes, they are better. But probably not better enough to warrant spending 3x the cost in my opinion. You still get 8 cores, 16 threads and it's cheap for an i7. If you're going for budget, grab one of these, you won't be disappointed",
