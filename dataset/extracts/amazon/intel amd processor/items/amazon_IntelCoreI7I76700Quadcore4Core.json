Chip had extra thermal paste that had leaked from beneath the cap, but I cleaned it up before putting it into my rig.Was looking for a cheaper alternative to upgrading the entire rig, so I bought this cpu to replace an i5-6500. So far, so good. Nothing appears to have been damaged, and the cpu is as promised.Great alternative to folks looking for an affordable solution and an increase in performance. Thanks!",

It arrived faster than expected and I put it in my system right away in case it didn't work for some reason it booted up fine and ran as expected. I did some stress testing and so far it looks great. Temps are as expected and everything is up and running. I would order again if the need arose. Very happy with my purchase.",
