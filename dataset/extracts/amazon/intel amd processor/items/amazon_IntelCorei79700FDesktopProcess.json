                "reviewText": "I upgraded from an i5-8400. Saw it was on sale (from an outrageous +$400 initial release last year to just $200 on Black Friday), so this was a no brainer. A lot of the feedback on this card online is negative since they\u2019re referencing the $/efficiency when it first came out. At this price, it\u2019s a bargain.I haven\u2019t seen much of an increase in performance, but XMP now works. I don\u2019t overclock, so the K version wasn\u2019t necessarily on my list. The boost clock speeds are almost identical to the K version, and the base clock means cooler idle temps which are both wins for me.I did have to update bios on my Z370 mobo to get it to work. You HAVE to update your bios if you have a mobo older than the Z390 boards by using an 8th generation coffee lake chip, which in this case, I did have.Temps fluctuate. Apparently it\u2019s from the speedshift technology. It reads changes in processes and temps adjust accordingly within 1/4th of a second, so benchmarks might be a bit alarming for novices. Otherwise, while gaming, the temps were around 53-60 temps. Using an aftermarket cooler. DO NOT USE THE INCLUDED STOCK COOLER. Noctua has amazing coolers.Also, for reference, I\u2019m using a SFF case, so your cooling mileage will vary. These chips can have been told to run hot, so make sure you upgrade your cooler.Did I need this chip? Probably not. But this chip upgrade was the only sensible upgrade I can make before upgrading my mobo.I\u2019m using a 1440p monitor and everything is stunning. I figure I\u2019ll upgrade my GTX1070 to something more recent to pair with the i7 9th gen. For these generation of boards, which are now obsolete, this is the best buy in this scenario.However, if you plan on buying a brand new setup, I would stay away from this chip and the coffee lake/refresh family. By buying this chip, you\u2019ll be trapping yourself, being unable to upgrade your chip in the future (since future chipsets are no longer compatible on these boards). These chips and boards have become obsolete and intel has moved onto more advanced chipsets. This chip is great for those within the Z370/390 family that got left behind or didn\u2019t want to upgrade their motherboards. For those who know, join us.",

                "reviewText": "Has been working well with my match up of i7 9700k, and 32gb ram at 3200ghz and a Asus 2070 super. Good processor for gaming. Even if the game is cpu heavy, it doesn't bottleneck much at all. I'm excited to push it to the limits of new games and I feel like I am only getting started on its capability. With the right motherboard, you get a consistent, and stable 5.1ghz from a slight overclock. Make sure your mother board has the Z, or you won't get to full benefit of this processor. If you do not have a motherboard that does not allow overclock, you are wasting your money.",

Replaced my 9600K, and I have no regarts. I can say that something was weird for a while after putting this in. I'm not sure if it was the motherboard, or the network card on the motherboard, but I was getting weird errors in chrome, and random tabs just erroring out. I updated the BIOS and put in a 10G NIC, and the problem went away. Going by the errors, I would say the BIOS update fixed it, but as I changed both at the same time, I don't know. But now I'm left with a nice PC that works well with my RTX 2080 in 4K. I'm happy.",
