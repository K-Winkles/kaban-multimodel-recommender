                "reviewText": "AMD has really done a great job in catching up and overtaking Intel. The Ryzen 5 3600 was, hands-down, the best budget CPU when I purchased it in 2020. For $200, this thing is an absolute powerhouse. This CPU will easily handle ANY games you throw at it, and can even stream at the same time without maxing out (at least from my experience). It ranks VERY well against its contemporaries (as long as you don't use UserBenchmark).It does run a bit hot, but the Wraith cooler that comes with it is enough to keep thermals within comfortable ranges. I use a 120mm AIO (which isn't the best CPU cooling method) and I rarely hit temperatures that exceed 75 while gaming.One thing I should definitely say now, in the era of Intel 11th-gen and AMD Ryzen 5000, this CPU is not worth it at prices above $200. The i5-10400 is running at $150-175. It may not be as good as the 3600, but it still is a good CPU and is much more affordable. Seeing this listing here that has the CPU at $240 is not good considering that we are in the era of Ryzen 5000 and Intel-11, AND Intel is tanking the prices of its 10th-generation processors.I am AMD all the way, but if AMD still wants to out-compete Intel in previous-generation sales, they will have to get competitive in the price area. If they do, then this CPU will definitely be a no-brainer buy for a budget builder since this CPU is still more than viable now.TL;DR - Worth it for $200 in 2020, not worth $240 in 2021 with the existence of Ryzen 5000 and Intel 11th-Gen. Still a very capable GPU for gamers. Would be more than worth it if price dropped to around $175.",

With this AMD Ryzen 5-3600 CPU ($80 with Spire cooler, that cheap?), 32GB of memory ($51), a M.2 stick (1TB, $44), and new motherboard ($70), I feel it is faster.Old PC boots up in 22 sec and this one under 15 sec in Windows and that is with the same graphic card, AMD Radeon R9 270.BTW, package came in damage/slit open, but CPU and cooler are OK .... No complaint so far... Should last another 5 years, then upgrade again... BTW, my CPU is always under $100 since 1995 that I self-built the 1st one...",

Not only that, it is one of the best, affordable cpus to support PCIE gen 4 speeds so your GPU and storage will be less of a bottleneck when you need the performance. (Only if you have a motherboard that supports the speeds. Basically a 500 series chipset)I haven\u2019t paid attention to power consumption but I\u2019m very sure it\u2019s a lot better compared to an equivalent Intel chips. Stock cooler will easily cool this chip as well.If you want to get into PC gaming, this is an excellent start, EVEN if it\u2019s a discontinued platform. I\u2019m sure you can find a Ryzen 3600 dirt cheap second hand. The real challenge is getting a new motherboard for this cpu. Make sure they\u2019re bought on websites or retailers with good return policies.Happy gaming!",
