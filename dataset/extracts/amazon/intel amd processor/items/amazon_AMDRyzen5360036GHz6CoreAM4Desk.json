Is it good for gaming? It will do the job. Strongly depends on the game as to how well it will do. Some games are not CPU dependent. I run mainly Tarkov. Which is CPU dependent. And this upgrade was a marked improvement on performance. I could play on the old chip. But load times were very slow. Now my load times are about 1/4 the time. That's huge for me.Would I recommend this? If this is what your budget allows, it will do the job you need it to.",

Inside the tiny box, there is only the CPU, the all-important sticker, and a manual of installation.If you are planning on buying a different cooling solution (my case came with an AIO), then this presentation is perfect. Brand new, it costs around the same as the few used models in Ebay located in North America.According to several reviewers, it is also just slightly worse than the 3600X so you are not losing much by going for the significantly cheaper model. I installed it on a B550M motherboard, and I had no issues so far. It is recognized by the BIOS as the advertised model.Granted, shipping was a bit strange, since it supposedly started in San Antonio, Texas, then appeared in Ohio three hours later. It was only delayed for two days from the original delivery date, so not much of a problem for me.In conclusion, if you are planning on using a separate cooling solution and you want to stay on AM4, it is a very good buy.",
