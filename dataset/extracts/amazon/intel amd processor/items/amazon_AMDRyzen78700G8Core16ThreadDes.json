Power efficiently, technically can run both Cyberpunk and Baldur's gate 3, etc, though obviously not as good as a $300+ dedicated card. It does put out about as much performance as $100-$200 new GPU prices though, which is impressive vs every other (non-Apple) iGPU.The 8600G has about a third less performance and 25% fewer CPU cores for a ben franklin less if that's all you need.Just remember this is mostly a GPU upgrade vs the prior gen (5700g). It's probably not worth upgrading from a 7600, for example. Unless you can sell the old one, in which case... then yeah it is :D",

                "reviewText": "I bought this 8700g for a media and light gaming PC for the lounge. It also set's up foundations for a future proof AM5 route.On release it is needing a BIOS update to remove a cycling of power dropping. This is because \"STAPM\"; it behaves as a handheld Z1 extreme (and performs as one) A future update will remove this artefact. The 780M internal graphics are on par with a gtx1650 or rx580. The processing power is on par with 7600. I only plan to play light games at 780-1080p on this; Cyberpunk and Baldur's Gate 3 are good >60 FPS. Some reviews got 1440p in games like Skyrim and Godbof War. I have another AM4-based PC for heavy gaming.As an APU it benefits from multi-channel RAM. I only use a dual channel Asrock phantom ITX mobo so could be better in a 4 channel ATX. Try to maximise the RAM speed, reviews mainly use 6000 or 6400 mhz. Some reviews have got it >7200mhz but not in a small form factor build.Comes with a taller Spire and not the Stealth CPU cooler.",
