                "reviewText": "I paid $229.99 for this. It's an 8 core, 16 thread processor that you can clock up to about 4.733ghz all core by upping the base clock on a z490 motherboard to 102.9. Good news - BCLK isn't tied to anything but CPU + memory frequency on Intel! They've separated all the other stuff that breaks. Paired with Micron Rev E (Crucial Ballistix 3600cl16) w/ memory overclocked to 4390mhz, it's fantastic (couldn't go further because of memory controller in the CPU.) But why isn't it unlocked? It would cost nothing for Intel to sell every CPU unlocked like AMD does, and overclocking an Intel processor right now actually gives you gains, unlike AMD with their already efficient boost algorithms. I would still hesitantly recommend this at $270, but it lacks PCIE 4.0 and is severely limited by that stock 4.6ghz boost clock. One of these at 5ghz with tuned memory would handily outperform a 5600x in games.",

                "reviewText": "There is nothing wrong with this processor. Depending on the motherboard you choose you will see a difference in performance. I choose the AsRock W480 Creator. Anandtech.com has a great article on this processor. Also Steve at Gamers Nexus has great information on the behavior of the 10700k with different motherboards. With my board I have seen the power draw go to 183 watts at 4.6mhz during cinebench r23 for around 50 seconds, then the processor's power draw drops to 95 watts and it slows to 3.6 mhz. When I actually encode a video it uses 82 watts at 4.6mhz. So it depends on what you are doing. I use a Noctua NH U 9s cooler with dual fans. Temps average 68 c at the highest. Browsing the internet or using Microsoft Word it idles at 29c and 30 watts. Not much a game player these days but it will use around 40 watts and temps are around 60c. I like it and would not hesitate to purchase another if needed.",
