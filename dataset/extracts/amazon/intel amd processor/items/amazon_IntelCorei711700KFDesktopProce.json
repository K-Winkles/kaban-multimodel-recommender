Everything air cooled since the last cooler was a liquid cooler that spontaneously screwed me over one day when the pumps failed while I was out of the house (somehow didn't fry anything besides my nerves). Watching the temperature on the CPU with this cooler, I have rarely seen the CPU hit 67c while running TWO instances of GTA V on max graphics.",
