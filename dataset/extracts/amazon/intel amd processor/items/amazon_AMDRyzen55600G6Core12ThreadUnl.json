                "reviewText": "I love this little chip. Sips power and does regular computer + modern games pretty well. Quite a generational jump from the days of AMD FX series and the Phenom line. I remember building a comparable machine six or seven years ago using triple core chips on the Phenom line and feeling like i had gotten a pretty decent bargain for good power. These modern Ryzen 5000 chips are a whole new level of performance. Desktop feels peppy with a Samsung 980 SSD and my mATX build is cute and simple. I was able to put the computer together for less than $400 thanks to this APU. I woulnd't recommend this for any serious gaming at 1080+ resolution. Graphics Card prices are low enough now to justify a traditional GPU build. For less intensive use cases, this chip is it. It boosts quite nicely and consitently to 4400mhz and the FSB runs 1:1 with Hynix kit 3600 Cl16 kit I have overclocked to 3733 with tighter timings using Ryzen Dram calculator. Additionally, i used Ryzen Master's Curve Optimizer settings to get even better performance and efficiency. Playing Halo Infinite at 720p lowest settings I'm getting 30-50 fps and with dynamic resolution 60-80fps with the HWmonitor reading 65C. at peak. Not performance i would be satisfied with for competitive play, but that's just not what this APU is for. Using Cinbench R23 this chip will definitely ramp up to 70c. I don't think i've seen it at or near 80c with anything but Prime95 very small fft. The wraith cooler is more than sufficient for this chip.+Quick and Efficient+Low Temps with stock cooler+Value+Lots of Negative Curve Headroom using Ryzen Master+Infinite Fabric can match high ram clocks+60 FPS+ @ 720p gaming in modern games+6 cores, 12 threads feels somewhat future proof+Low Power draw @ 65watts-I'm kinda mad that mine came with three bent pins that i managed to fix. Amazon's fault and i feel kinda cheated.",

                "reviewText": "I built my desktop a few years ago during the height of GPU shortages, so the integrated graphics card was a lifesaver. It's got solid power and has served my semi-budget editing desktop well. I've been using the stock cooler, and I haven't had any issues. Paired with 32GB of RAM this CPU handles 4K video in Premiere, Resolve or Avid well enough, but for large projects you're still better off proxying the footage.I'm not much of a gamer, but have played a few. Realistically, this CPU probably won't hold you back on video games as the GPU does most of the work. The integrated graphics will get you through and runs well enough for low-mid settings, but if you're actually wanting to game get a dedicated GPU",

This thing works perfectly and it provides plenty of power for everyday computing, programming, and a little bit of gaming.AMD provides great support in the Linux kernel for their products. I am running Debian stable (bookworm) and everything so far that relates to the cpu and igpu have worked flawlessly.I had until now been using a core i5-2500k from 2012, and this processor provides a nice boost in performance. This processor along with my new nvme storage means I almost never have to wait for anything to happen on my computer. Compiling and installing software, running virtual machines, and heavier computer tasks all feel trivial now.The 5600g all by itself provides a pretty decent integrated graphics experience on Linux. Through steam and proton I've been able to play games like overwatch 2 on lower setting with a pretty good 45-50 average fps even when things get hectic.This CPU hits a lot of sweetspots for a budget CPU. If you sound like a budget CPU shopper this is probably what you're going to land on for a while.",

                "reviewText": "If you're playing games at 1080p, and not doing insane tasks, this is the right CPU for you. I had one before the one I just bought, and not being nearly as experienced with computers, I never monitored its temperature and it likely toasted itself over time. The new one, however, is working like a charm. If I have a tip for you, it's this.Step 1: Go to the searchbar on the bottom left and type choose a power plan, and then open.Step 2: You'll see the balanced (recommended) one. Click change plan settings.Step 3: Click change advanced power settings.Step 4: You'll see a list with some plus signs left of various things. Click the plus sign to the left of \"processor power management\".Step 5: Click the plus sign next to \"maximum processor state\".Step 6: Click the number (I assume it will be 100%) and change it to 99%.By following these steps, you'll limit the amount of power your CPU receives. Now, this isn't dangerous, provided you don't set the number really low. I first set it to 70% while following a video. Then I slowly increased it to 85%, and I noticed an insane drop in temperature (around 20-30c) while playing various games. Red Dead Redemption 2, for instance, was cooking my CPU beforehand, and then I turned down the variable and the high temperatures were gone. Now, does it affect performance in any way? It....can. The 5600G is a 6 core, 12 thread processor. When setting it to 85%, the base clock of 3.90GHZ dropped to around 3-3.16GHZ for me. I've noticed zero affect on performance. If there is an affect to performance, it would be a few frames in games, MAYBE. If that. And for browsing the web, I have yet to notice anything. Now of course, if you're planning to use the 5600G as an APU solely (if you don't have a graphics card), then I would be a little more careful with lowering the variable. But if you have a graphics card then I wouldn't worry at all. Some people don't recommend the card because \"it's not good enough\", but how is it not good enough? It shatters web browsing, gaming, streaming, and basically everything that the average PC gamer does on their machine. If we're talking about more advanced activities, then yeah. You might want a CPU that has more cores, or one that is able to reach a higher speed and overclock. If you're planning to build a computer that is just gonna game at 1080p-1440p with some web browsing, Discord and streaming on the side, it's the CPU for you. Just pay attention to your temperatures. The last 5600G I had cooked under my nose. Ryzens get pretty hot.",
