                "reviewText": "I build lots of computers for my clients, both AMD and Intel based. AMD would have you believe that ryzen is some groundbreaking performance monster and if you believe the media ryzen left Intel in the dust years ago. If you build as many PCs as I have, and work with both platforms on a daily basis you know that's not quite the case. Ryzen is a great platform to be sure, the 3000 and 5000 series perform great typically, however they are often unstable (even without OC) and glitchy and seem to have way more issues than Intel cpus. I won't go into specifics but I'll put it this way: I've exchanged probably 1 in 3 AMD ryzen 5000 series cpus I've purchased for builds and not a single Intel chip. This chip in particular has always proven a stable and extremely well performing example of Intel maturity and stability. It performs exactly as you'd expect and the \"silicon lottery\" always tends to be in your favor with Intel and particularly with this cpu. Don't get me wrong, ryzen is a huge leap forward for amd, and a great platform for high performance and or gaming, but i-series intel just always seems to have a slight advantage (maybe not in benchmarks, but I'm real day to day usage anyways). I'm not an amd fan boy or an Intel purist, I just want a good product to provide my customers in their builds and this is a great cpu by all metrics.",

                "reviewText": "I didn\u2019t want something I could overclock as I don\u2019t really mess with that stuff anyways. I just wanted something I could drop in and go. I also didn\u2019t need the onboard graphics as I had a GPU already lined up for this install.This was the perfect option for me to get a more modern intel processor without all the extras I wouldn\u2019t use anyways. Coming from an i5-4690 this thing is light years ahead.I can\u2019t speak for the stock cooler as I opted for a AIO cooler instead but even under some lengthy gaming sessions I don\u2019t see temperatures get very high at all.",

                "reviewText": "This processor is great, but there are a few things I don't like. Please keep in mind, I purchased this to upgrade a current machine I own (Aurora R11), not build a new one.Number 1, the cooling solution it came with did not fit my board. I had to modify a working solution. The chipset runs hot already, so why the clips? They are pretty cheaply made.Number 2, not worth the $300 cost in 2023 for the improvements it creates on machines that can use it. It's easier to build a new machine and buy a 12th gen. I've done this.",
