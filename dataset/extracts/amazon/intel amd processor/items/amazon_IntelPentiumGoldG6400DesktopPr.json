                "reviewText": "I wanted to take this review to directly address those thinking of purchasing for gaming, as I haven't seen too many reviews about this.For the value, this CPU is insanely good, but you must know what kind of games you want to play before you pull the trigger. It is a 2-core, 4-thread CPU which is the equivalent of what older gen i3 CPU's were. It is very snappy for browsing & basic needs, but how does it handle in-game? Here's my experience. I have this paired up with a 4GB R9 380 GPU and 8GB of DDR4 at 2666. Windows 10. Some sample benchmarks:Apex Legends: AVG 65, Low 46 on mix of low/highWitcher III: AVG 71, dips to high 50's in Novigrad, all high with shadows on lowFortnite: AVG 123, Low 76, competitive settingsModern Warfare: 50-60 AVG on mix of settingsNow obviously these are rough samples, and YMMV depending on your GPU and config. You can probably push higher frame-rates with even just a 10th gen i3. However, if you are on a budget, or you don't care much about having the most consistent frames in the world, this CPU is a killer value. I, for one, learned an important lesson with this CPU. Stop caring about the frames, and just enjoy the games. Even still, the performance this CPU can push on a healthy PC build is beyond acceptable. It is not a AAA game crushing chip, but it will play a lot of games from 2015 onwards perfectly fine.",

                "reviewText": "This is a budget cpu that delivers as long as your needs are not excessive. It functions for Internet browsing and for television viewing on an ASRock motherboard (z590 pro 4) with 16 GB of memory. I upgraded from a sixth generation i5 and I find no lag whatsoever in performance. For the price, it is hard to imagine a better performer. This is a 10th generation cpu and the motherboard accommodates 11th generation processors as well, so down the road an upgrade is possible and maybe even likely. For now, however, this chip sufficiently meets my needs. If your budget is not so robust, or if you prefer to hang onto your money, give this chip serious consideration. I have had other Pentium chips in the past that were good performers, and this one carries on that tradition. Best wishes for satisfying computing!",

I\u2019m using the integrated graphics and it plays back 4K content better than a fourth gen Xeon with a dedicated graphics card! If you buy this CPU with realistic expectations of what it can do, you\u2019ll be thrilled. For under $50, it would be hard to beat. My system runs at 19 watts when the HDD\u2019s aren\u2019t in use, which is quite nice. It\u2019s snappy when opening folders and web browsing, and boot up and shut down times are relatively quick as well. You could probably play some legacy games with this CPU. Again, as long as your expectations are realistic, you will likely be pleased.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not one that races out to type a CPU review. There is already plenty of information, benchmarks, etc. on the web detailing the performance of this chip and/or chips that are similar. Ultimately, I'm hoping to present a little clarification regarding what one may expect to receive when purchasing this item.So, if the headline of this review has caught your attention it may have been because you noticed the product description states that it \"doesn't\" come with a thermal solution (AKA: heat-sink/fan). However, like some other reviewers/commenters have stated, \"it does\"! (or at least mine did). The item I received was in retail form and included the stock heat-sink and fan (case badge and all). I've come across similar dependencies on other retail sites claiming the same thing. Sad to state, purchasing this item felt like more of a gamble if anything.Does that guarantee the one you purchase will include one...Don't know! But it may minimize the reluctance to purchase it seeing that myself, including others, have had the same experience and can confirm that the item received was indeed a retail variant.All in all, if it comes down to it, it is a relativity inexpensive chip. Even though potentially receiving one without a thermal solution may not be all that desirable, many aftermarket solutions can be found on the web and are rather cost effective when dealing with a chip of this type. So, the $10 or less region may not be out of line for an adequate thermal solution. Just think of your possible usage scenarios and buy accordingly (if it would even come to that).I bought this knowing it may not have come with a cooler, so I can't state I would've felt burned getting one without one. \"5 Stars\" for exceeding my expectations!Best of luck!",
