                "reviewText": "JUNE 12, 2013 UPDATEI've had this CPU for going on four months now. It's still rocking it! Runs the latest \"Metro Last Light\" with a breeze. TO fixing my heating issues I mention below, I have upgraded the fans on my radiator to the Corsair SP120 high performance fans. As of now I have this thing running at exactly 5018Mhz stable right now. Also over time I experimented with RAM. Believe it or not, decreasing my RAM speed actually gained me some FPS in all of my games (its running slightly below 1600Mhz now). I recommend doing FPS benchmarks if you are aiming for gaming with this. Also I wanted to add in my last Power Supply blew up on me. I am now using the gold rated Corsair HX750 that seems work better with this CPU overclocked in terms of heat/stability.Let me skip all the BS. This is a BEAST of a CPU! I've had an AMD Phenom II x6 1045t for the past year now. Although I loved the 1045t CPU, it simply wasn't the greatest for gaming. My stock speed was 3.9Ghz and I overclocked it to 4.5Ghz via the turbo, but with turbo on the Phenom II chips, only three cores would activate. I also was gifted recently an XSPC Raystorm rs360 liquid cooling kit and with that high end cooling I simply wanted the best overclockable chip out there.For about three month's I eyeballed this CPU up on various websites. I wanted it desperately, but I had a few issues and asked myself the following questions. Was it a big enough upgrade over the 1045t? Was it worth buying over the cheaper 8320 model? Lastly should I consider saving up for an intel system instead because of AMD's rocky future in the CPU world (reports say the excavator models are pushed back to 2014 at least)?I took the plunge - I ordered this CPU and could not be happier. The base speed of 4Ghz is awesome, it's nice to see something like that right out of the box. Furthermore the overclockability of this chip is absolutely astounding. You can overclocked it to the Moon assuming you have proper cooling. With the Raystorm rs360 I was able to get this chip to a stable 5Ghz, liquid cooling the CPU and the VRM's on my motherboard.Overclocking is nothing without performance though - how does the CPU perform? Excellent! I got a very noticeable framerate increase in all my games. Crysis 3 I can run completely maxed out with msaa on medium at 60fps (which some intel users can't even handle :o)Some minor pet peeves/issues with this CPU:1) If you're doing overclocking, you will absolutely need a custom cooler. This is a very power hungry, very hot CPU at overclocked speeds. This thing has scarily overheated on me a few times already, I've gotten this to a stable 5Ghz, although I can run it at speeds of up to 5.4Ghz it simply gets too hot at anything else. Although the stock cooler is actually impressive having copper on it, it's still not going to do the job. Here's what I recommend per the speeds you are trying to reach based on my own experience and from what I've read on the web:- Coolermaster Hyper 212 EVO or similar: 4.6Ghz- Closed loop cooler (such as the h100i): 4.8Ghz- Custom cooling kit: 5Ghz+- At least a 600w PSU for anything above (this thing consumes alot of power overclocked)2) AMD STILL SUCKS WITH HIGH SPEED RAM. If you're overclocking this thing even slightly, good luck getting the specified 1866Mhz RAM to work with it. I can only run mine at around 1700Mhz. I tried two modules at 8GB and four modules at 16GB. Could never get this to stably run 1866Mhz, even at stock CPU speeds. If you'r buying RAM stick with a 1600Mhz kit.Other than the power/heat issues and the RAM, this is a great CPU. I paid for a $200 CPU and it felt like I got what I paid for performance wise. Vs. Intel you will see alot of users complain that the \"per core\" performance isn't as good, and than an Intel i5 3550k will outperform this. Personally I don't give a crap. I'm not reverting my whole system over to Intel just because some silly benchmarks are slightly better. Besides the multi-threading of this CPU will blow away an i5, especially in DX11 games which do utilize all 8 cores.One more thing - vs the AMD 8320 I think this is a much better buy - $10-20 more and you're getting a CPU that's going to be much better in the overclocking department and the increased speeds are going to be much better in gaming. Overall definitely worth the money. Great CPU that will last years to come and AMD's future is rocky if you're waiting for the \"next\" best thing I think you should just go with this...My build:8350 @ 5Ghz, 1.5v core, 250Mhz bus speed, 20x CPU multiplierGigabyte 990FXA-UD3XSPC Raystorm rs360 water coolingPrimoflex tubing w/ deionized waterEnzotech wmst-81 VRM Water BlockG Skill Ares 1866Mhz (4x4) 16GB RAM (@ 1700Mhz)MSI Radeon Twin Frozr III 7950 overclockedCorsair Force 120GB SSDThermaltake 600W PSULG Blu Ray reader/writerNZXT Phantom Full Tower case (white)",

                "reviewText": "I decided to buy this CPU because my Phenom II x4 965 BE has aging architecure and it was starting to show in more modern games. Yes, it can still keep up FPS-wise, but stuttering is there, and that's annoying to a gamer. So, I got this. I had my 965 clocked to 3.8 pretty much its whole life. And the 8350 is clocked stock to 4.0. Night and day difference. Don't let the 200mhz clock difference fool you, if you have your 965 clocked to that (most everyone does), it's seriously night and day.Although the FPS is of course higher with the 8350, the stuttering is not there anymore. And it doesn't bog down. Heavy AI based game put strain on your CPU, and I love to play Men of War: Assault Squad. This CPU improved that drastically. Yes, the 965 can keep 60 FPS in games a lot, but with the 8350, there's hardly any of no dips in the fps at all. Diablo 3 is a prime example with max settings, this thing blazes through it.Now, with temperatures. I have this thing setup with a Cooler Master Hyper 212+ with 2 Cooler Master 120mm 2000rpm fans hooked up to the PSU to keep them at high speeds all the time. My idle is at 15-16c and video game load it's 30c. Compared to the 965 which ran at 34c idle and 45c under gaming load. Always keep in mind that AMBIENT TEMPERATURE is important to what your CPU temperature is going to be! I like to keep my room around 77F to get these temperatures. With the AC off and this CPU heating my room to 80 within an hour, temperatures rise to 25c idle and 34c under load. Although the FX CPUs run cooler, they get A LOT hotter than the Phenoms. They just spread the heat better to the Heatsink than the Phenoms did. Oh, and throw away the stock cooler. Save yourself the worry and get an aftermarket HSF setup with a push-pull if you can with your case or a water cooling setup. Extend the life of the CPU. Sorry for the long review, but anyways:Pros:-High stock clock and easily overclockable-Disperses heat very well through aftermarket Heatsink(never tried stock, too many reviews against it)-8 cores for super multitasking, yaaaaay!-Can easily play new games at 60fps at max settings when paired with a good GPU.-Very affordable for its performance it gives.-Got it for $179-Finally got something to replace my aging Phenom II x4 965 BE :D.Cons:-Still can't keep up with any of Intels high end CPUs-Will heat up a room in a jiffy with a case that moves a lot of air-Garbage stock HSF for gaming.-ZERO protecion for the pins on the CPU in the retail box. It actually worried me quite a bit. The CPU is just snapped into plastic holders. My other CPUs usually came with a type of foam for the pins to contact into just in case.My build:Cooler Master HAF X(Blue Edition) w/max fans.Seasonic SS-760XP2 760W, 80 PLUS PLATINUMASRock Fatal1ty 990FX KillerAMD FX-8350(at stock clock) w/ Cooler Master Hyper 212+ w/push-pullGigabyte Radeon HD 7970 OCADATA Gaming Series 8GB(motherboard specified clock)ASUS DRW-24F1ST CD DRIVEASUS VX238H Monitor @1080pLogitech G230 Stereo Gaming HeadsetLogitech G15 KeyboardLogitech M510 MouseMicrosoft Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bitSteelseries StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty Gaming Mousepad",

                "reviewText": "Ich habe diesen Prozessor nun seit 2015 in meinem PC am Start und denke, dass ich eine Bewertung auf Langzeiterfahrung verfassen kann.Kurzfassung f\u00fcr alle Eiligen: Der Prozessor macht auch heute noch Problemlos alle Spiele mit ohne Probleme. Wichtig: Windows 11 unterst\u00fctzt diesen Prozessor nicht!Auch wenn ich nicht wei\u00df was die im Hause Microsoft rauchen...Hier die ausf\u00fchrliche Fassung:Auch heute im Jahr 2022 macht der Prozessor ohne m\u00fche auch die neusten Games ohne zu klagen auf h\u00f6chsten Einstellungen mit.Im Spielbetrieb habe ich auch im Sommer unter Volllast keine h\u00f6heren Temperaturen als 55 Grad gemessen. im Normalbetrieb 20-24 Grad.Diese Werte werden selbstreden nicht mit dem mitgelieferten K\u00fchler erreicht.Wer diesen verbaut und ein Spiel unter Volllast f\u00e4hrt riskiert den Prozessor zu besch\u00e4digen, da eine \u00dcberhitzung vorprogramiert ist.Ich selbst habe 2015 einen Dark Rock TF verbaut und bin bis heute mehr als zufrieden mit dieser L\u00f6sung.Es gibt und gab immer den Glaubenskrieg zwischen Intel und AMD Fans hier meine Meinung:Ich hatte vorher auch immer nur Intel und dies war mein erster AMD Prozessor und ich kann als Ottonormalnutzer(Games, Filme, Streamen etc..) keine gravierenden Vor oder Nachteile feststellen.W\u00fcrde mich also bei einem Neuaufbau des PCs bei entsprechendem Preis wieder f\u00fcr ein Produkt von AMD entscheiden. Wie gesagt ich hatte seit 2015 keine negativen Erlebnisse mit dem Prozessor.Ich denke AMD h\u00e4ngen mangelhafte Produkte aus ihrer Anfangszeit und dem entsprechenden Ruf bis heute nach. Vergleichbar mit Opel und dem Rost der 70er 80er Jahre.Wichtig w\u00e4re noch, dass Windows 11 diesen Prozessor nicht unterst\u00fctzt!Auch wenn man sich freilich fragen darf, was im Hause Microsoft geraucht wird: Schaut euch gerne die Liste von unterst\u00fctzten Prozessoren an: Da sind einige darunter, die weit weniger Leistung haben.Fazit: Wer kosteng\u00fcnstig einen leistungsf\u00e4higen Prozessor sucht und nicht sofort auf Windows 11 umsteigen m\u00f6chte ist hier noch immer gut ufgehoben.Abschlie\u00dfend sei noch zum Thema Windows 11 gesagt: Hier muss auch keiner Panik haben, denn Microsoft sichert Updates f\u00fcr Windows 10 noch bis zum 14.10.2025 zu. Bis dahin kann man dann auch ruhig einen PC mit diesem Prozessor nutzen.",

                "reviewText": "You were one of the lucky ones to have bought this back when it was first released. In all honesty, this chip still run's today's games!But, DO NOT BUY OR upgrade now as ryzens & better are out.About the CPU?This CPU plays well in 1920x1080 GTX 1660 AMP todays video cards in games likeMonster Hunter World 60fps with about 70% CPU utilization at 4.2Ghz or higherThe Division 2GTFORoad RedemptionKilling floor 2FortniteResident evil 2 remakePretty much any game released yesterday with the right setup.My system specs other then videocard & cpu:RAM: ripjaws x2 16gb ram with ares x2 16gb ram XMP @ 1600mhzPSU: 750w CorsairHDD's x2MB Gigabyte 970 rev 2.#GPU's tested with this processor:GTX 960 AMP gddr5 & GTX 1660 AMP gddr6Some games are broken as they are older or are frame limited. Other games may work better on single core performance as well such as ARMA 3 & Escape from Tarkov. However. The AMD FX 8350 series still is one of the best chips on yesterdays market for the FX series. It also holds the highest OC online 8.1Ghz! Meaning, the RAM speeds & other components is whats actually slowing it down at this point. Since there is no DDR4 am3 socket MB, there is actually no telling how far this CPU could go.P.S. I do not recommend trying to overclock pass 6ghz at all lul. On the box, yes, it says you can achive 6ghz.WARNING:DO NOT USE or BUY WITH STOCK FAN! You will expierence so many issues from noise to BSOD to freezes, lockups, shutdowns. The Stock fan cooling is way too TINY for this power hungry CPU & it will slow it down performance wise & may cause damage over time due to lack of cooling. If you do use the STOCK fan, I recommend disabling Turbo Mode right away & keeping all cooling options enabled. Power options for windows, set CPU cooling policy to PASSIVE. & be sure its always on Balanced mode in power options. This will keep things better.",
