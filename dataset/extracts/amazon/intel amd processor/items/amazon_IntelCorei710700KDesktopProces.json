                "reviewText": "Don\u2019t let the 125w TDP fool ya because this chip runs WAY cooler than previous gens. Tested temps using OCCT stress test for about 3 hours, alongside my Noctua NH-D15 cooler. The highest I\u2019ve seen the temp spike up to was 71c. Note that OCCT is a heavy synthetic test that pushes the CPU to the limit. Regular gaming temps will never reach that high. I\u2019ve had the chip for almost two months now and accumulated quite a bit of gaming hours during that time. The games I played included a mix of intensive AAA titles like CoD Warzone and AC: Odyssey to light eSport ones such as Rocket League and Rainbow Six Siege. Highest temps are always in the 50s to mid 60s range. That is a huge difference compared to my old i5 6600k that spiked to over 80c at times! My brother who bought a 9900k last year was also amazed by how much cooler 10th gen runs and even said that he wished he waited a bit longer before upgrading. Note that both the 9900k and 6600k have lower TDPs than the 10700k yet still run warmer. The reason as to why 10th gen runs cooler is because intel made modifications to the IHS of the cpu and upgraded their Thermal Interface Material. Other then the improvement in the temperature department, I\u2019ve also noticed a big difference in gaming performance. Despite having a 2080 super, my PC used to struggle to reach and stay at a consistent 100+fps at 1080p. CPU intensive games like AC Odyssey often dropped to like 50fps. This is a clear indication that there was bottleneck on the CPU side. With this new 10700k, My PC now has no problems reaching and maintaining that sweet consistent 144+ FPS on light competitive eSport titles and 100+FPS on demanding CPU intensive AAA titles. Also, note that I am running the CPU at stock settings right out the box and have not messed with overclocking yet. Nonetheless, I am very satisfied with this CPU and I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Overclocking is a breeze",
                "reviewText": "I've had my 10700K for about a month now. I paired it with a brand new Asus Maximus XII Extreme and kept my 2080 ROG Strix. The three make a beautiful pairing. If you aren't planning on overclocking, I'll just say, pick this up and you won't regret it. If you aren't speed-chasing, it isn't worth the extra money of going to the 10900K. If you are overclocking, I personally believe the money-performance ratio puts the 10700K on top. But, speed-chasing would suggest picking up the 10900K.As expected, temps are a little hot when overclocking. I used XMP I, clocked to 5.1GHz and left voltage on adaptive. My mobo thinks it's a good idea to stick a whopping 1.545v into it to support 5.1GHz and hit over 100C (exact temp unknown, neither of my monitoring programs read hotter than 100C), but that's totally unnecessary. Dropping down to 1.46v, highest temp spike during stress test hit 90C, not a degree warmer (25min stress test using Cinebench, 360mm ROG AIO). My goal is to hit 5.2GHz this evening. If I have the ability to update reviews, I will post results.Overall, 10/10, strongly recommend. It's a good out-of-the-box processor, and it's fantastic for overclocking, at a price point that doesn't make you want to rip your legs off.",

                "reviewText": "I waited too long to switch back to the FPS king. This chip is amazing. I missed you Intel.The PC world is weird. Always chasing $50 savings. Too many games have CPU bottlenecks. I debated hard between just buying a 3700x to replace my 2700x versus the hard MB/CPU upgrade to Intel. But AMD had left me frustrated. My 2700x was never maxed out and I couldn\u2019t tell what was bottleknecking me. The 3700x didn\u2019t promise much higher clock speeds so I wasn\u2019t sure if an upgrade would help. I play Rust on 1440p and my GPU and CPU would sit at 60% utilization or less with frames only around 70fps. First test with the 10700k stock and I\u2019m at 135fps, max graphic settings. My GPU is now pumping out 99% utilization and the game feels amazing.This chip runs cool on stock. Idk where all the bad thermal predictions came from, but it didn\u2019t happen. Haven\u2019t even OC\u2019d it yet and honestly I may not need to until I upgrade off of my 2080super. But that\u2019s not happening any time soon. I\u2019m hitting 144fps on 1440p max settings now in every FPS game and that was the goal.Thank you Intel, you nailed this one. The 9th gen had some cost/heat issues and that made me give AMD a try and I\u2019m glad to be back!For anyone choosing a card. The 10700k is the sweet spot for gaming and streaming. If you only game, I think the 10600k is a cheaper but same performance. I don\u2019t see any need for the 10900k.",

This rarely happens but from time to time this can happen.I contacted Intel and asked for a replacement and they agreed as it was under warranty obviously. While I had to pay like $10 to ship it to them which I originally thought was sorta cheap since other companies like MSI cover the shipping costs I can see why Intel doesn't.While I only paid $10 for shipping I assumed it would be ground shipping from Canada to the middle of the USA and figured I'd be without a CPU for up to 2-weeks.Turns out Intel ships via Air and my package was on a Plane and arrived at the facility within 8 hours and I had a new CPU in my computer within 72 hours.I would highly recommend this product even after my issues because Intel was as fast as possible with replacing mine.After using this product for a few months it's worked great and performs perfectly and I've had no issues since getting the original replaced.",
