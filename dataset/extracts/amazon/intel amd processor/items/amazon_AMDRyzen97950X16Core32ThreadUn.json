                "reviewText": "What I like to do is run CPU intensive things in the background while also playing games. Often times I can go in Ryzen Master and drop the clock and voltage down and things still run at a satisfying degree. I've used this playing at 1080p-2160p. Top to bottom no issues. Like 2 months later the 7950x3D was on sale for what I bought this for but it is what it is. AM4 lasted a long time. Someday I'll be buying some x3D 16 core from the last AM5 gen CPUs.It's great when you have software that lets you choose to encode/simulate on the CPU and set how many cores to use. Give 8c/16th and play games without issue. I've kept up with bios updates so I haven't had issues with the overvolting EXPO stuff that was in the news. I use a Thermaltake Peerless Assassin to cool it and that's been adequate even when playing at stock voltages where it hits those 95 celcius temps. You can undervolt this thing, drop the clocks a bit and the performance difference is negligible.If you're a software developer, you'll enjoy the amount of cores for running VMs, docker containers, compiling software, etc. I like photography so enjoy playing with RAW photos in Darktable and mild things in Krita. Going from a 4770k to this was a pretty massive change.I feel like people buying CPUs seperate probably know what to expect. I was able to run a 4770k for 8 years. I don't want to run this for 8 years but I wouldn't be surprised if the performance in games at 2160p is so minor that I just keep going on with this and occasionally upgrading the graphics card",

Aparte de que el procesador se calienta horrible(Tengo una liquida de 420MM Thermaltake) y consume casi la mitad de mi 4090 ROG cuando hago codificaci\u00f3n de video en H264(la app no me deja Usar NVENC ni ning\u00fan otro codec) Los Ecores se ponen al 100% y los Pcores no pasaban del 65%, lo cual denota un cuello de botella desde los Ecores hacia los Pcores.Con el 7950X he logrado much\u00edsimo mejores temperaturas y el rendimiento usando todos los n\u00facleos mucho m\u00e1s estable, de paso no he tenido problemas con una B650E Asus ROG de ning\u00fan tipo de momento. Para juegos no lo he probado demasiado pero el que se compra uno de estos cpus para juegos creo que es un desprop\u00f3sito(con el 13900KF o 7950X TODOS los juegos van perfecto), mejor se compra un 13600K o 7800X3D.

                "reviewText": "This cpu has excellent performance and is substantially better then the 5950x I was using before. However there is one small gripe that has bothered me and so far no solution is available. If you use XMP or EXPO ram when you enable it the sleep option is disabled in the firmware. If you run at stock with no XMP or EXPO profile it will still work but defeats the purpose of buying better quality ram. I have tried two motherboards and update to the latest bios on both as well as switching between 1 2 and 4 sticks of ram and putting timings clock and voltage manually. If you buy this cpu and want to oc your ram your going to have to shut down or hibernate your pc every time you turn off your computer. I will update my review if a solution is presented but this is a serious issue that needs to be resolved. Especially if EXPO is amd certified but disables sleep option. Edit march 2023: sleep option now successfully works after recent bios update however it causes weird behavior with the fans but that is likely just something with the motherboard.Edit April the 2023: after bios update everything works as it supposed to",

But overkill is underrated!But you get fabulous support. I had to RMA my original one (it wasn't actually broken, found out the motherboard is the cause, and Gigabyte is showing me the wrong way to provide Support). They were helpful, paid for shipping. Did everything amazingly.I hope they pay their staff enough, but I'd love to see a tip jar or something for their support teams. I'd love to buy them a drink/coffee or just contribute to the company party fund.",

VMWare also works great all my components! Thanks AMD. BTW, this is better than Intel if you decide to go with VMWare since all those cores are \"full cores\". Intel uses those E-core/P-core construction and they will not be compatible in VMWare, at least with my knowledge.",
