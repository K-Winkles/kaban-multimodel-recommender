However after adjusting the fan curve profile and adjusting positive/negative case pressure, even under extreme loads, usually holds around 85 (-) but for the most part, now sits at around 65 (+-) during all games where as before, would sometimes hover around 88 under heavy loads and now is 40 (+-) idle. Pure Fan cooling here, and my buddies use basic AIO's as to which theirs hold around 61 (+-) under load and 45 (+-) idle. Absolute power house of a CPU, Woulda gone for the 7800x3D but honestly didnt need that much extra power.",

                "reviewText": "The 7000 series processors are notorious for running at high temperatures, undoubtedly due to higher power consumption and additionally, this is assissted due to the thick IHS.This processor, the 7700x, is fast (really good for mid range CPUs) and I was able to install it without any hiccups.If you have kept up with the news regarding the AM5 motherboards, some of them (specially ASUS, along with some GIGABYTE boards) were literally frying the CPU along with the socket due to the unreasonably high voltage deliveries to the processor. (Additionally, out of the box, AMD has set these processors to run at 95\u00b0C, further adding to the problem and they said 'it is MADE to run at 95 degress by design' - still I am a bit uneasy hearing this.)This was the story of nearly a few months to a year ago. HOWEVER, since then, the constant BIOS updates have really stabilized the boards and I can safely say, AM5 platform has stepped into the mainstream territory.Some tips I would suggest, just for the safety, first of all, these new AM5 boards come with 'BiosFlashback' feature so you could update the BIOS to the lastest version without installing anything else. Watch videos for further details.Secondly, I believe the 95\u00b0C 'being normal' is uncomfortable for a lot of people. What I did with my ASUS b650 E-F motherboard is that I tweaked the BIOS a bit and undervolted the CPU to 1.20V from 1.30V. Also did some adjustments with the Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO) setting, the Curve optimizer and I set the Thermal throttle limit to 75\u00b0C which I feel comfortable with.No doubt, my processor runs at around 95% capacity BUT staying at 75 degrees, I feel much comfortable now. You won't see any noticeable change in performance and your processor stays cool.It's much better to stay safe with these temperatures and expand the lifespan of these processors.Hope this helped :)Edit: It's just over a month since I have been using this processor. Let me mention, the temperature doesn't really go above 60\u00b0C and averages around 55 degrees.The only time I hit 75\u00b0C was when I stress tested it.My computer is running smooth and I'm really satisfied with the results, the main one being, it is not going supernova.Oh and just to mention, I am using an AIO cooler.",
