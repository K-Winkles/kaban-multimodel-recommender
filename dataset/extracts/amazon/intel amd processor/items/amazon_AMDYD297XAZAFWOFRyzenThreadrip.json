I was skeptic, but man, was it money well spent. This machine is a beast. I run a software company from my home, write programs, use AutoCAD and enjoy video games. This processor handles everything. Many times I need multiple computers to test different operating systems for my products. This processor can handle everything I have thrown at it, without even one single time of slow down in a year! One time, I was running five different operating systems IN THE BACKGROUND for a week, and didnt notice. I also believe, in that year time, I have only turned off my computer about 24 hours total. The only time it is shut down is for required updates, which takes one restart, and then it is back up.The only downside I had with this processor was there was no clear instructions on how to install it. There are two sleeves on this processor, and I thought there was only one. It took me a while of saying, 'Why doesnt this fit?' before I realized I had to REMOVE the outer sleeve and KEEP the inner sleeve. Made no since. But, it worked out in the end.I cannot express how happy this processor has made me. This processor is well worth the money.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Nice, but go with the 2950 except for niche cases",
                "reviewText": "The 2970 Threadripper does indeed have 24 cores, producing 48 threads. I swapped it into my main PC, moving my older 2950 (16 core, 32 threads) CPU to my media server/NAS.In my experience with the 2970, from a practical standpoint, I haven't found it to be any improvement at all over the 2950, EXCEPT in very specific use cases. The 2970 has the same clock speed at the 2950 and MOST applications, to this day, just don't know what to do with 48 threads/24 cores, and the CPU remains underutilized in most applications. Transcoding, gaming, and standard office word won't noticeably increase on the 2970 over the 2950. (The 2970 WILL allow you to run 2-3 instances of CPU-intensive encoding/transcoding at the same time though, pinging the CPU all the way to 100% (which is the only way to actually get it to 100% in my experience))HOWEVER, if you, like me, run VMS, then this CPU will start to make more sense. The massive bandwidth available to the 2970 will allow you to run a full VM of a resource-intensive OS (Windows 7+, Linux servers, databases, etc.) side-by-side with your main PC's OS, without even blinking. That was the primary use-case I got the 2970 for, and it works flawlessly.If all you want your threadripper for is faster gaming, encoding, decoding, transcoding, etc, stick with the 2950. You will get essentially the same experience for FAR less cost. Or, save up and go with the Gen3 Threadrippers on the new sTRX4 sockets from AMD (which is the reason I stuck with Gen2 for now, as I DO NOT want to upgrade my MoBo in the current post-COVID parts and supply drought).So, 5 stars from me, with the above caveats ;)",

I ordered the threadripper 2970WX and ended up receiving a set of cheap keytags with a sticker that has all of the 2970WX infomation printed on it. How could amazon let this happened? I am returning the \"very expensive keytags\" now. Buyer beware of this scam.",

The first one I got did not boot beyond the PCI initialization. Don't know why. Thanks to Amazon's great return/exchange policy, I was able to get another one. This one booted right up! It is definitely faster than what I had before, and now I can upgrade to Windows 11 as well.",
