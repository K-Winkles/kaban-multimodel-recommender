I only recently had to upgrade to this one from a 2600X I bought like six years ago. It's extremely power-efficient and therefore runs very cool. My PC is set up to be silent, so it only has a 120mm liquid cooler and only spins the fans up to be audible if the CPU exceeds 65 C. That almost never happens with this CPU.",
