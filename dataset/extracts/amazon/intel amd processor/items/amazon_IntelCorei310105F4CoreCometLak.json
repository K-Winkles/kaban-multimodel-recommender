It does better than I expected. No on board graphics though, but I had a GTX 1050 ti. Fresh build, and it installed windows fine, runs everything great.",

Box was also clearly handled, I didn't notice until I went to open the box. Product does work just fine as of writing this but who knows what will happen. The CPU cooler was without the pre-applied thermal paste which unless you have some can push your completed build a few days back.Although seller problems aside, it's a great value processer for less than $90. You can't beat the gaming or even desktop performance with anything in the same price bracket. Would highly recommend if you're on a tight budget.",
