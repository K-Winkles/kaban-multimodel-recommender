                "reviewText": "Was able to snag this for about $150 before taxes on a random flash sale, and used it to upgrade my home theater PC, which I mainly use for VR and more casual titles at 4K in my living room.For me, this replaced an aging i7-6700K. The performance uplift is night and day between the two, and this would make a fine chip for any new gaming PC you might put together today. Please note that the F variant does not have integrated graphics, but if you already have a GPU then this won't matter for you. This is only 6 cores, 12 threads as well. Being an 11th generation chip from Intel, there's no performance vs. efficiency core debate here, 6 cores is what you get.One word of caution is that as I write this review this CPU is currently listed for $199, which is about the most I'd recommend paying for this CPU. The $150 price I paid was fantastic of course, but it's not something I would rely on getting again even with Black Friday/Cyber Monday coming soon. A newer i5-12400 will offer similar levels of performance for roughly the same or potentially less money, though that isn't overclockable. A 12600K would blow this out of the water, but you're looking at a far more expensive CPU. The Ryzen 5600 or 5600X are also great foils for this CPU, especially if they can be had for a cheaper price. The AMD chips also have the advantage of cheaper motherboards for that generation compared to the Intel chips at the moment.End of the day, if you can get this for a good price, go for it, but this wasn't the absolute greatest even for its time, and newer chips can sometimes be had for a better price.",
