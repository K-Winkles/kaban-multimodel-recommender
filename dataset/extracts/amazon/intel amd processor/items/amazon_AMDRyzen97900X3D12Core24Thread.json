I run both Intel and AMD processors depending on what they are needed for. As of this time, Intels 13/14th gen is just as good as AMD's 7000 gen for gaming and workloads, depending on specific use case. I chose AMD because the motherboard options were better and the upgrade path with AMD is typically better (the exception being Threadripper). I haven't noticed a BIOS or driver problem any different from my Intel builds. It's being used with 32GB of memory, a 4TB NVmE drive, and an NVidia card for gaming (purchased 2 budget Intel and 1 AMD 7900XTX video card for other use case builds) and water cooling. It's a solid processor that can handle some harsh workloads.",

                "reviewText": "I installed this in my Asus ProArt x670e motherboard. I use an Arctic Liquid Freezer II 280 RGB AIO water cooler. I like that it switches between two chiplets one with higher frequency, the other with a higher cache. So you can have your cake and eat it too depending on if you are doing normal productivity type tasks or gaming. The switching between chiplets is done by Xbox game bar and is generally automatic. Nutshell is if Microsoft thinks you are running a game it switches to the X3D cache otherwise it uses the frequency optimized chiplet. You can check by bringing up the game bar with windows-g then looking at settings. The tdp is quite low at 120 watts, so it\u2019s a very easy load for my water cooler, so my cooler is pretty quiet and it\u2019s easy to keep the cpu well below its TJ Max. I also used the bottleneck calculator at the pc builds website, and per their estimation this CPU is well matched up to a Nvidia rtx 4070ti gpu. this was completely fine for my usage.",

                "reviewText": "I have to say I love this processor. I made the jump to a totally new platform. It is NOT without it's growing pains (which I can say now have settled at least for me).A lot of YouTubers say get the 7800x3d... if you do need core speed for programs or have games that use core speed this makes alot more sense. I think (my opinion) that once the bios and drivers are more optimized to use the necessary cores that have cache, vs higher clocked cores for performance this will be a amazing buy.Right now, it's a beast!I run it on a ASUS ROG STRIX X670E-E... the bios here was an issue... with all 7000 cpus it seems over volting cpu/mem controller could cause damage to the cpu or motherboard. I was lucky... my pc shut off randomly several times and I had to manually reset the psu. It seems my psu was saving my hardware. I was chasing down a possible PSU, RAM and motherboard or cpu issue. I spent weeks troubleshooting to no avail, all the answers I got from everyone was to RMA... I wanted to narrow it down so I didn't have to wait weeks for the turn around of each part.Finally I saw a new BIOs from ASUS.1410 is the newest I am using but both this version and 1303 claim to limit SOC voltage to 1.3 which should mitigate the shutdowns and possible damage.I really do love this chip and the X3D really is amazing in gaming. Really removes the lower .01 and 1% frame rates.I'm totally happy with the performance and am playing with per core curve optimizer. Now that I have more stability I can play with the chip more.Temps- from my observation the IO die temps at idle are in the 40C range... so that reads as the package temp... when actually the cores are in the 30s and 20s depending at idle. I also run a custom loop with dual 360 rads with the cpu and gpu in the loop. So I'm happy with the temps.All in all a great cpu, if just gaming or want to save some cash can do a 7800x3d, if you can use the higher core speeds of a 7900x3d this cpu is for you.",

                "reviewText": "This CPU is great. It works flawlessly with my 4090 but I wish I had waited for the 7800x3d instead.While the CPU has 12 cores, the new 3D Vcache makes the CPU park 6 of those 12 cores since its stacked on one side. The performance is great if you use your PC for both gaming and productivity but if you only game, you are better off getting the cheaper 7800x3d. It only has 8 cores but since the 3D Vcache is on all 8 cores, none of the cores are parked and you get the full use of all 8 cores vs the use of only 6 cores with the 7900x3dI take this as a learning experience and while i have a little buyers remorse i can't say that the 7900x3d doesn't perform well. It's just that the 7800x3d makes the 7900x3d inferior for more money.",

                "reviewText": "Long time AMD CPU lover. Last one was a 5950 and this provided a nice uplift in performance. I was unsure whether the cores on a 7800X3D was enough. For a few dollars more this met expectations. I would have bought a 7950X3D but there is another new series planned for the AM5 socket. I will buy the new model when it is available.",
