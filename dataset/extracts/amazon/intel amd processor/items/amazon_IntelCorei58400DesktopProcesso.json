                "reviewText": "Intel BX80684I58400 8th Gen Core i5-8400 Processor Please note that my mini-review is based on the limited in store testing, I am still waiting for my CPU to arrive so I can confirm the findings.To sum up, i5-8400 is currently the most affordable way to get a six core Intel build. It works out at $30 per core, which is even less than a cost per core of previous generation Kaby Lake CPUs.The downsides are - the multiplier overclocking is disabled and the base clock is pretty low, the TDP is limited to 65W.In practice what this means is a lot of benchmarks that can take advantage of 6 cores will look better than a 4-core CPU, but in single threaded tasks or some games, faster clocked cores can still give better responsiveness.The i5 8400 offers more than good enough performance for most tasks and uses very little power in idle and is still limited to around 65Watts under load. In my view this makes it a very good CPU choice for a main productivity/gaming machine that is powered on 24/7 or most of the day.The 6 cores future-proof the computer in case one suddenly wants to try their talents and a video game streamer or something similar.Paired with 370 chipset it also opens up a possibility of an upgrade, if someone really finds this CPU to be too limiting.Overall, I find this particular CPU to be of very good value currently and also offering enough performance for the majority of computing tasks - hence 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "At first I was thinking of getting the overclockable version, but coming from a potato laptop with a 4th gen i7 processor, I was okay with getting this version i5-8400, I like it, it's snappy fast, all works good so far, and i'm happy to say that, because I've never built a PC before and I just did 2 days ago by watching youtube tutorials lol, but I realized that if I wanted the i5-8600k I needed to get a more expensive motherboard, so I ended up saving lots of money to invest in the GPU and other peripherals.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE 2/25/2019 :After about a month of using my PC with this processor, I haven't had any issues with it! installed Extreme utility Tool for intel to verify the temps of the processor, Playing fornite after 1 - 3 hours, it has not exceeded more than 57 Degrees, so it was always pretty cool, I'm using the CPU cooler Deepcool Gammaxx 400 white LED. CPU usage never exceeded 75% I believe also while playing/rendering, used this processor with the Asus dual GTX 1060 6GB + 16GB 2400mhz Ram.For an 8 minute video in 1080p 60fps format, it took about 10-20 minutes of rendering ( of course load is both on the CPU and GPU during this process) , paired with the board : B360M DS3H + SSD Adata 240GB, the PC boots in 13-16 seconds from the moment I press the power on button on my computer. I am happy I went with this processor instead of the i3-8100 ( which I was thinking of at first ) but my friend suggested an i5 of the 8th gen at least for basic future proofing .( BTW ) my YT channel is : Zealous Pumpkin check me out ! I do meme edits and funny videos about fortnite lol!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE 4/17/2019:3 months in using this beautiful underrated CPU! This thing is really nice , For any interested gamer ,Fortnite 1080p Maxed out an i5-8400 CPU + GTX 1060 6GB will play from 60-90fps , I cap my fps to 120 with my custom settings and with unlimited fps, it can reach 200fps+ sometimes and minimum 120. this processor with the right cooler, has never gone over 60C for me , and I live in quite a hot country btw. got this for 179.99$ before black friday and have never seen it go lower than that ( Just once on May-August 2018) for the same price but never again , so it was a great deal.",

                "reviewText": "Product arrived quickly, installed easily. Make sure to have the arrow in the corner match your motherboard cpu mounts arrow, or you will damage the fragile pins. For those who don't know, 8400 means 8th gen where as a 7400 or 6400 means 7th gen 6th gen ect ect. MAKE SURE YOUR MOTHERBOARD IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE CPU, BEFORE PURCHASE. As for the performance of the cpu. It is very quick, plays all games on max settings with no issues at all, runs programs smoothly. Nice to have a good gaming pc after years of old and dusty computers and laptops. Keep your stuff clean and cool! No reason to spend 1000 dollars on these i7 or i9's. This is more than sufficient. Good luck people\ud83d\udc4d",

                "reviewText": "This processor has been really good for me thus far in terms of programming and running code for my work related activities. I also do shoe botting with it and it has handled stress from 3 different programs at once which says a lot about this processor. However when I start to play games like Warzone at some pretty high settings it starts to falter and lags a little bit. I would recommend this processor for intro level gamers and not the experienced ones who need perfect settings for everything. It has great value for its price",

                "reviewText": "After watching several YouTube videos and recommendations I decided to go with the Intel I5 8400 CPU. I am not interested in overclocking my CPU/RAM so did not consider the I5-8600K. The 8400 has 6 cores, and there is a turbo mode built into the processor that safely increases the frequency when needed AND DOESN'T VOID the Intel warranty. Also, 65 watts of power consumption so the CPU will run cooler not requiring liquid cooling. There have been some negative comments about the default fan - again back to YouTube videos showing it does adequately cool the CPU (by the way, the CPU is running 86 degrees right now)! The fan is very quite compared to my previous FX-6300 gaming platform. I paired the I5-8400 with the Gigabyte Z370 HD3P ATX motherboard and 8GB of 2666 ddr4 memory. CINEBENCH NUMBERS DOUBLED over the FX-6300 system that I have been using this past 3 years! Relatively easy installation and system booted right up and has been running fine for several days. Higher fps (60+) on all games so far (1080p monitor) and rich, detailed colors and great sound!",

                "reviewText": "Desde marzo se me antoj\u00f3 cambiarme de componentes en mi ordenador. Ten\u00eda anteriormente:-CPU: Intel Core i5 4440 3.1GHz-GPU: Asus Strix RX 470 OC 4GB-Placa: Gigabyte B85M-D3H-RAM: 16GB DDR3 1866MHz-Fuente: Aerocool KCAS Bronze 600WLo \u00fanico que quer\u00eda cambiar fue la CPU, la placa y la RAM. Ya que como mi anterior PC ten\u00eda Intel de 4\u00aa generaci\u00f3n, CPU de DDR3, y placa con socket de 1150. Para saltar a la nueva generaci\u00f3n, ten\u00eda que cambiar la CPU, que adem\u00e1s, hab\u00eda que cambiar la placa, y hab\u00eda que cambiar la RAM. Opt\u00e9 por el Intel Core i5 8400 de 2.8GHz, la RAM era Ballistix Sport LT de 16GB DDR4 de 2400MHz (8x2) y la placa era Gigabyte B360M-DS3H.Con todo esto, manteniendo la gr\u00e1fica y la fuente de alimentaci\u00f3n, obtuve unos mejores resultados tanto en embalaje de productos, como de calidad de estos mismos. Del i5 4440 al i5 8400 ha sido como un 30% o m\u00e1s de mejora, as\u00ed como la mejora de la RAM al pasar de 1866MHz y DDR3 a los 2400MHz y DDR4.La CPU si bien a m\u00ed se me calentaba unas pocas veces debido a las m\u00faltiples tareas que hice los primeros d\u00edas (instalar programas, juegos, etc), el rendimiento es indiscutible que es de calidad-precio. Por menos de 200 \u20ac tienes una buena CPU. Con respecto a los juegos, probando The Witcher III: Wild Hunt en Alto-Ultra mantuve alrededor de los 60 y los 75fps (activ\u00e9 la V-Sync porque el tearing del juego me molestaba, y mi monitor era de m\u00e1ximo 75Hz), y los resultados eran sobresalientes, sino que m\u00e1s destacables. Si quer\u00e9is montaros un buen PC para jugar, el i5 8400 es una buena inversi\u00f3n para lo que vale, pod\u00e9is jugar a pr\u00e1cticamente todo con este procesador. Se aprovechan muy bien los 6 n\u00facleos y 6 hilos que tiene, con frecuencia de base de 2.8GHz y turbo de hasta 4.0GHz.",
