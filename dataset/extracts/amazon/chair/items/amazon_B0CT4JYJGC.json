                "reviewText": "It's not a glider, a recliner, or a reading chair. It's a rocking chair that has arms set at the \"ladies' chair\" height, which means you have elbow room for things like needle work. You won't be resting your elbows on this while reading unless you have a mighty wingspan. I will give it this...it went together quickly, easily, and securely, and the instructions give people a reminder to tighten it up every six months or so, which you need to do with all \"modern\" furniture. Although the fabric is wicked soft, the chair is hard as a brick. The seat is wide, and if it had a modicum of padding, it would be a wicked comfy chair. Too bad they missed the mark on that one. I'm not sure i'd use it to rock a baby because babies are messy and this could be tricky to clean properly. Also, if you're rocking a baby, you'll probably be spending some serious time in this chair and your butt will get sore unless you throw a pad on it. I does look very nice in just about any room, though. If you're going for looks and relatively solid construction, this is your chair. If you want to curl up in it with a book, get a pad.",

It was pretty easy to put together; just don\u2019t tighten the screws on the bottom rods into the chair before placing the rockers on otherwise it will seem like the holes are off center. It doesn\u2019t rock at all on its own; you do need to push it each time because the length of the rocker arm is shorter in the front. We still love it and the Sherpa fabric matches our desk chair.
