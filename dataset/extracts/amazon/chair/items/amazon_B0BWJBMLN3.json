However, I liked these enough that I ordered another for the other chair in the room.",

I love how it completely covers my little couch. my couch measured for the 3 cushion size so that's what I got and it fits perfectly. it does move around a little but I'm not too worried about that because I just need it to keep the couch clean. I would recommend!! I will be looking at getting another one for our recliner and our bigger couch because I have been so thrilled.",
