I do wish the backrest could be set one more notch further back than the two options you have when assembling the chair.The backrest was a bit uncomfortable to me, so I flipped the way it was installed, with the long side facing down. This way my lower back is better supported and i can rest my elbows on the ends comfortably!I've added a gel seat for comfort since sitting for long periods at a time is difficult with this chair. I've added a headrest as well by clamping it to the top of the back rest and it has been a game changer.All in all, I thought this chair was a win until I modified it to my liking. plus the footrest is sturdy! it hangs by the base of the chair, unlike the competitor that has extra sets of legs with wheels.",

I applaud Vivo for their outstanding customer service.Update 2/6: The seller contacted me and is sending me a replacement bracket. Hopefully this is just a small manufacturing defect. Their tracking says I should receive the bracket on 2/9 will update after that. Until then I have a stool.On the chair I received either the backrest support bracket is manufactured incorrectly or the screw for it is too short. I think the bracket is manufactured wrong as it only has threads on half of it and it has a lip not visible in the assembly manual. I've reached out to the seller to see if they can get me parts the function. But for now I am left with a chair I cannot really use with comfort. For the price quality control seems like an issue, I will update my review if the seller provides parts to make my chair function properly",
