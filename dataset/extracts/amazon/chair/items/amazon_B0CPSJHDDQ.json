That\u2019s true in this case, and the good news is it wasn\u2019t one of the hard/impossible assembly jobs. To start with, they have a blister pack of all the small parts in individual, well-labeled blisters AND a very handy, actually for me indispensable, L-shaped allen wrench tool. The directions are also very clear and specific. The actual putting together by mostly screwing screws into the designated holes went without a hitch. It was a repetitive task, and getting them in firmly took some effort, but the allen wrench tool gave me just enough leverage to get them tight. There\u2019s also a little blister of extra parts that I\u2019m going to keep with the allen wrench screw, because the directions recommend retightening all the screws after 6 months, and from experience I know that those escape artist screws disappear quickly. I took off one star because I don\u2019t feel real confident about the holding power of some of the material and because the seat wasn\u2019t all that comfortable, although everything works at this time.",

It took me about 20 minutes to put together with the enclosed Allen wrench and instructions. The chair is quite sturdy, and the material is soft and durable. I have the brown chair, and the color is exactly as pictured. I\u2019ve used it for about three or four days now, and I feel like my back is less sore because I can sit in a way that feels better for me. My only wish is that the seat was just a little bit wider, but overall, I am really happy with this desk chair.",

The rollers work smoothly and the seat is ergonomically shaped for comfort. It went together very easily and the manufacturer had a nifty ribbon attaching the set of hardware and tool for assembly, so they wouldn't get lost. Everything was well thought out, and we are very happy with it!",

                "reviewText": "This was one of the more in-depth assembly experiences I\u2019ve had w a chair, but with my years of IKEA and whatnot experience, it took about 10 minutes to assemble after it was completely unpacked.The fact it came w extra hardware is nice, plus the included Allen Wrench is cool and easy to use.The chair is comfy, has a nice range of heights, and rolls really well.The pleather may have a bit of a smell to it, but the directions say to air it out a bit. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a strong overpowering smell, just a bit of a cardboard boxy type smell that ya have to stick your face on the chair basically to smell.It\u2019s unfortunate the back isn\u2019t adjustable though.",
