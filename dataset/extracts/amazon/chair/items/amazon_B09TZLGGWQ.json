                "reviewText": "As mentioned, out of the package it's quite stiff. Not a terrible thing, as I wanted it for support and it will probably soften up as it breaks in. It's also pretty thick. I tried it in my office chair but felt like I was sitting on the edge of the chair and sliding forward all day. Ended up putting it in my car which is perfect. I'm kinda thin and it seems like every car seat nowadays is made all rounded and coushy for larger bodied people and I just sink into them and it hurts my back. I don't like sitting like that when I drive so this stiffer back helps me sit up straight. Only drawback to it being in the car is that the softness changes according to the temp. It's much more firm on cold days and much softer in the summer. Pretty good coushin though all around.",

The cushion is kind of thick- it could probably be thinner and do the job just as well. It has a strap in back which won't work with the width of a sofa. I don't know how it would work with a recliner or an armchair, but mine works just fine without the strap. It's comfortable and compensates for the flaws of my sofa. I can't remember how much it cost, so that must mean it wasn't too incredibly expensive, but judge for yourself. It's comfortable, I like it, and I use it every day. I have no complaints at all about this.",

                "reviewText": "If you're reading this, you likely find yourself in a situation like mine: extended hours at a desk, grappling with back issues, and in search of a solution. I opted for this product thinking it was a cost-effective answer. While it looked promising quality-wise, once I attached it to the chair, I found it too thick. When seated, it felt as though the cushioning was overemphasized, almost double the thickness I needed. Simply put, it wasn't the right fit for me.I considered returning it since I had saved the packaging and only 10 minutes had passed since unboxing. However, the return fee is $7.99 for a $16 item. It doesn't seem worth it to spend half the product's cost on a return. What's truly disappointing is the idea of paying for a return on Amazon. We shop here believing that if a product isn't satisfactory, it can be returned with ease. While I seldom make returns, perhaps once a year, I appreciate the option. This purchase was an overall letdown.",
