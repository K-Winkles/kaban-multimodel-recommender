            "\u3010Y-shaped Backrest Ergonomics\u3011The back of the armless office chair adopts a Y-shaped design, which can better support the human spine and protect the lumbar spine, making users feel more comfortable when working for a long time.",

My seven year old son and I put it together in about 10 minutes, although it's easy enough to put together on it's own. I like the look and the cushion is nice. It doesn't sit on the chair perfectly but I think it needs to just stretch out a bit. I don't think this would be the best for anyone super large or really heavyset though, but it's perfect for us as we are a small family.",

It\u2019s light weight and comfortable for a small persons cushion is about two inches thick, so probably wouldn\u2019t be comfortable for a larger person or a tall adult to sit on for too long.
