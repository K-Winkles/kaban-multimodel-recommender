My hesitation was that I would have nowhere to store them. When the chairs arrived, I thought that part of my order was missing because the box was so small. Boy, was I wrong. Theses chairs were not only beautiful and sturdy, but also stacked so efficiently, that 10 of them fit into a box that was only 11\"x18\"x39\". I will be purchasing 50 more for my daughter's backyard wedding and my annual backyard barbecues.",

Delivery was fast. 5 starsDelivery was one week ahead of schedule and the chairs are solid, yet light and easy to carry. The frame is well made and there are no pointy bits or pieces that stick out and catch on your skin or clothes. The plastic of the seat and back is substantial and feels very secure when you sit down. The chair doesn't wobble and it feels solid. I am 260 pounds and when I stood on the seat, there was no give or bend to either the frame or the seat. The color of the chair is more of a brick red than bright or true red - it blends in more than it pops. Completely satisfied with purchase",
