I put it together. Was easy! Even the arms are cushiony! He loves it! It was his birthday gift. I am 71 and had no problem with assembly, did have my husband go behind me and do a final retightening.",

I purchased this chair to replace a 15 year old office chair that bit the dust. It is comfortable enough to work in my new home office but I wouldn't know how it performs against my several hundred dollar office chair I sit in 9 hours a day. Great looking chair, love the armrest that raise and lower. I mean this is a steal for the $75 I paid. Would certainly buy this chair again. Cant go wrong..... got the red & black its cool...",

                "reviewText": "Went together like any other chair. A lot more comfortable than the chair I was using before. I wish the arm rests could move higher and lower, but the only adjustment I have found is either fully up for no arm rest, or fully down. The only small complaint I would have is that 1 or 2 of the instruction steps are poorly written. They aren't really needed to figure out how to assemble the chair, but the step that mentions the arm rests doesn't make sense. Otherwise awesome product.",
