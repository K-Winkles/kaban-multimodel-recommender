I read the reviews before purchasing and purchased a pillow for each chair to add comfort. I think it works well with or without the pillow. I would purchase these again and I highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "These chairs are a great bang for the buck. The cushions are firm, which I like because they wont wear as easily, and they seem very sturdy. They also have a decent width so that a bigger person, such as myself, can rest comfortably in them. However, I expected a more mid tone grey from the pictures, these chairs are more of a dark grey (if you buy the grey color). It's mildly disappointing since the color match I had planned is unfortunately out the window, but they're really nice chairs so I'm going to deal with it.",

                "reviewText": "I knew anything I bought would be better than what I had. I saw a few reviews saying it was uncomfortable, unstable, etc.,I\u2019ve had this for a week now and I\u2019ve been using it every day, and while I do have a couple of gripes, they\u2019re minor. The chair is very very stable, it sits level, the beige faux leather is VERY soft feeling, it does actually look and almost feel like real leather. You can tell it\u2019s not because it does feel thinner. Think mid 2000s Honda leather, if you\u2019ve ever owned a Honda car or minivan. That\u2019s what it feels like. Assembly was also easy. The 4 legs have 4 included bolts each, and the Allen key is provided as well, and the seat back just drops into place, although it did take some finagling with the bottom cushion to get the seat back to slide all the way in. Once put together everything is sturdy and level.It does have a 300 pound weight limit. I am at that 300 pound weight limit. When I sit in it, it doesn\u2019t wobble, it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s going to collapse, it doesn\u2019t scream out in pain, either. So big thumbs up on the build quality there! It does need to be said that I don\u2019t slam down into the chair either, primarily because it does in fact sit high enough to easily get in and out of, which is absolutely a god send for me with my bad back and arthritic knees. The arms are very high up and stable, I can gently sit, and gently stand back up. A massive improvement over my last chair.I saw people gripe about the size and it being too small for tall people, I\u2019m 6\u20193, 300 lbs. This chair is almost perfect. Size wise, no complaints.My only complaints are two:The seat back is too straight, not enough angle to it. Some people may prefer this, I don\u2019t, however a pillow takes care of that.The cushion does flatten out quickly and wrinkle. It\u2019s not very thick. It\u2019s firm, but with a comfortable amount of give, but the wrinkles aren\u2019t particularly sightly.All in all though, I do give it 5 stars because the value is unbeatable. A brand new chair for less money than picking up a beat up used one on Facebook marketplace is a get. I will probably buy a couple more for other rooms in my house!",
