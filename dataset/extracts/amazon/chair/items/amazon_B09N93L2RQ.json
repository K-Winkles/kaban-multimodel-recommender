                "reviewText": "This chair is great for the price. The cushion on the chair is pretty thick so it makes the chair really comfortable to sit on for long periods of time. If you\u2019re someone who likes to sit up with you\u2019re legs in the chair this is a good choice because of the cushion size, for reference i\u2019m 5\u20198. The material is good quality, I actually spilled some matcha on the armrest cloth piece and it came off nicely, the material is easy to clean. It comes with a cover to go on the seat cushion that is really cute and soft (make sure you put the cover on before you assemble the chair because you can\u2019t once it\u2019s put together). I personally took the head test off in the picture because I like to see more of my desk but there\u2019s nothing wrong with it, It\u2019s just a personal choice. Also the headrest is adjustable. One thing that could be better is the cushions on the arm rests they\u2019re a little thin so the arm wrests are a kind of hard hard. Overall this was a great purchase, I\u2019d recommend this chair.(assembly took about 30 minutes and the directions were very clear and concise)",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Great chair, but not for the way I sit",
                "reviewText": "I've been sitting in this chair 12 hours a day for a month now, and I finally feel like I can write an honest review about it.The chair was packaged very well, and was one of the easiest chair constructions I've experienced over the years. The tools were great quality and I was able to construct it alone with no issues.Visually, the chair looks nice. The colors pop, and it doesn't have a \"cheap\" look to it, despite its plastic and mesh design.When first sitting in the chair, it's comfortable. The seat cushion is slightly firm, but soft enough where I don't feel too much fatigue using it, especially during those long sitting sessions. The mesh seat back is nice, and I don't feel the pressure of the back's frame on my shoulder blades. The headrest is a nice touch, as it has a slight give to it, making it comfortable to lean into.After a few weeks, however, I'm noticing I've had some lower back strain/problems which I didn't have in my previous chair. So I'm not very comfortable anymore. It's also affecting my sleeping positions, making it difficult to get comfortable and fall asleep quickly.A majority of my sitting time is spent cross-legged with my back pressed firmly against the backrest to keep my spine aligned, and doing so on this chair, I think, is partly causing the problem. Because of the discomfort, I'm constantly changing my sitting position between \"proper\", leaned back, cross-legged, and leaned forward. With my old chair, I could sit cross-legged the entire time with my back pressed against the backrest the entire workday and not have any issues.There's an adjustable lower backrest, but it has some issues. For one, it doesn't stay in the position you keep it in, and you'll need to readjust it if you squirm around in the chair or get up and leave for a while (it will fall back into its lowest position on its own). Even keeping the back rest adjusted, I still can't find a comfortable position for long sitting sessions.Also, there are plastic covers for the joint screws on the swivel arms. These pop out constantly, falling to the ground. There's nothing to lock them into place aside from light tension. I've hammered them on with my hands, but it only lasts for a day or so before falling off again. I've resorted to taping them on.For its price, it may not be a terrible purchase, especially if you're not planning on sitting for actual office-length work day in and day out. However, I'll likely be looking for another chair. In the meantime, I'm trying to switch to an orthopedic seat pillow and added armrest cushions to increase the longevity of it, but I don't like that I have to resort to these measures on a chair 1 month old. We'll see if the cushions help the lower back pain.Overall, it's not a terrible chair. You can do much worse, especially for the price. But for anyone looking for something comfortable for long sitting hours, I don't believe this will be your chair.",

                "reviewText": "I received the chair last week, it was packaged very well and all pieces were included. I was able to follow the instructions for assembly and my only recommendation is to make sure you add the included cushion cover BEFORE you assemble to chair. This step is not included in the instruction booklet and I found it impossible to add after assembly (and had to backtrack and disassemble the chair to add the cushion cover and reassemble \ud83d\ude05). Overall so far I\u2019m really excited to use this chair, it looks modern with clean lines and feels comfortable. I\u2019m not sure I understand why the bottom of the headrest touches my upper shoulders and only time will tell if this will be tolerable to me or not. I don\u2019t expect to use the headrest so much so if not, it\u2019s possible to take it off. I like the wheel, the adjustable lumbar and that I can push the armrests up, which allows for the chair to fit under my small desk. So far, it\u2019s a thumbs up for this ergonomic chair.",

Everything was packed in a box so nicely and it was a little funny but a great detail that it came with white gloves for assembly. Literal white glove service. The chair was easy to set up, took me no more than an hour - probably would\u2019ve been shorter time if I wasn\u2019t watching TV at the same time. The cushion is comfortable, the headrest is comfortable, and it feels so nice to not have to sit in a dining chair while I work. The parts were in great condition, the only thing was there was already a little knick in the swivel part of the arm rest but it\u2019s really not noticeable. Now my husband is thinking of purchasing a chair! Wish there was a black color for him",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this chair in white and I'm eager to share my thoughts on it. Right out of the box, the chair's aesthetic appeal is undeniable. Its sleek white color adds a modern touch to my workspace, fitting seamlessly with my home office decor.As for assembly, it was straightforward with clear instructions. I was able to put it together in a relatively short amount of time without any major hiccups, which was a relief.The chair's comfort level is where it truly shines. The ergonomic design supports my back and posture throughout long working hours. The adjustable features allow me to customize the fit to my liking, ensuring I'm comfortable and well-supported at all times. The seat cushion is particularly noteworthy for its plushness, making extended periods of sitting much more bearable.Durability-wise, the chair feels sturdy and well-constructed. The materials used appear to be high quality, and the chair maintains its stability and comfort even after consistent use. This aspect is crucial for me, as I wanted a chair that could withstand daily use without showing immediate signs of wear.In terms of value, I believe the chair offers a great balance between quality and price. It's an investment in my comfort and health during work, and so far, it seems like a wise choice.If I had to point out any drawbacks, it would be the limited color options. While the white is beautiful, having more choices could cater to a wider range of personal preferences and office decors.Overall, my experience has been overwhelmingly positive. It checks all the boxes for comfort, support, style, and durability. For anyone in the market for a new office chair, I highly recommend considering this one.",
