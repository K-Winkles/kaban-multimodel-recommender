It will be easy to keep clean with a damp cloth. The instructions were simple and concise. The only help I needed was pushing the castor wheels onto the legs, which my husband did very easily. This was a great price for the quality of the chair. No tools were needed for assembly; a sturdy Allen wrench was included with extra hardware. I highly recommend this chair. I am very pleased with it.",

I didn't give it a 5-star review because the color is not white, more of a cream. I was expecting and wanted white like the product pictures, but the cream will have to do. If you want a true white this chair isn't for you. I placed the white paper on the chair to show the color difference.",

It's small, but comfortable and fits under a desk nicely. It took about 15 minutes to assemble and the instructions were simple and clear. The allen wrench tool supplied is quite nice with a large comfortable handle so you can get some nice torque in the screws. The manufacturer also supplied a couple of extra parts, just in case! I'm very satisfied with this chair at an excellent price.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this chair mostly for its color; I love the orange hue of the brown and have two other chairs that look similar, a bit bigger, and 2x the price. This chair is half the price of my previous and it is more comfortable, more durable, has smoother rolling, more padding, and much higher quality fabric. I love this chair so much; as soon as I sit down on it, I feel all the pressure on my bottom go away.I sew for hours straight and I get up feeling so much better than any other chair I've used to work with before. The back rest meets perfectly to the center of my back (I'm 5'4) and feels secure and comfortable when I lean back in it. My husband is also around 260lbs and 6'4 and feels just as comfortable in the chair as I do. If you need this chair for the weight capacity, I think it definitely carries quite a bit more than 300lbs.I didn't check the size of the chair before buying but the size is much shorter than a typical desk chair and fits perfectly in my small cubby desk. So this chair will save you a lot of space and pain in the a**!Finally, the assembly was so incredibly easy and of all at-home-assembled furniture I've bought, the allen-key wrench is also the best I've ever used. It makes it so easy to turn the screws and doesn't hurt your hurts like many others.I wish I had bought these chairs instead of my previous; if you were thinking of buying this, here is your confirmation.",
