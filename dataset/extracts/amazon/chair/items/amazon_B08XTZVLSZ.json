                "reviewText": "My last chair purchase was a few years ago and I foolishly had jumped on the \"Gaming Chair\" craze, what a joke, those chairs are so uncomfortable once the padding is compressed.I spent the better part of an hour researching this purchase, I had very specific height and feature requirements. Fully adjustable armrests, a tilt that can lock in more than just the upright position, webbing instead of crummy foam, blade style wheels, and I wanted it to look nice. I have a black and white color scheme going on at my desk and the style of this chair matches perfectly.The chair arrived in good shape, box was roughed up, but contents were 100% intact. Included a surprisingly decent tool for screwing the chair together. Not the usual bent piece of steel that they call a wrench, this was a T-handled wrench, I didn't even need power tools to put this together.The chair includes a warranty registration sheet, Oline contacted me shortly after submitting with an offer to extend the warranty to five years instead of one if I just shared my feedback with them. Full-disclosure, I was also offered a lifetime warranty for coming to Amazon and sharing my opinion. That offer does not alter my opinion of the chair, it is a solid chair that I find very comfortable. Highly recommend it to anyone who's done with gaming chairs and chairs with crummy foam.",

                "reviewText": "I'm very happy with this purchase. Before buying, I tried a variety of chairs, including a Herman Miller Aeron. While I loved the Herman Miller chair, I feel this chair competes closely with it, and for about $1,800 less, it was an easy decision.What I enjoy about this chair:- The 4D adjustable arms. This feature is important to me because I adjust my position frequently throughout my work day. If I fee like using my mouse, I can adjust the arm so that my arm rests perfectly for that position (I lift the arm up, and twist it to the right for the perfect angle). If I want to use the touch pad on my computer, I adjust the arms for the perfect position (I twist the arm rests in and lower the arms). This ability to change throughout the day helps tremendously with hand/wrist pains that can occur from typing/ working on a computer all day.- The lock/ recline options are great. Initially, I didn't think this mattered to me, but I find myself locking the seat upright at times, and then I'll release it so I can rock back in my chair. I had never had this function in previous chairs and am really enjoying it. Again, it's changes your position so it alleviates any tension from being in one fixed position for so long.- The head rest is great and adjust in a number of positions. This is another feature that I wasn't sure I needed, but since it was included at this price point, I thought \"why not?\". I find myself using it often, particularly when viewing videos on the computer.- The lumbar support is great for me. I know this kind of support differs for people, and while this lumbar support is not adjustable, I find it very comfortable and a nice feature. I don't have preexisting back issues, so for people who do and really have to dial-in a perfect lumbar placement, this might be something to consider. After market lumbar pillows might help with this.The seat:- I like the curve of the chair. As the chair curves down where your thighs rest on the seat, it takes off pressure. I see this design on pricier chairs, and it makes sense.- The only thing that can't be adjusted is the softness of the seat. I like the mesh... it's cool looking and it doesn't get me hot. I find it comfortable on it's own, but after a long days work, I missed my foam seat cushion, pictured in the photo. I really enjoy my cushion.. and there aren't many chairs that offer such a comfortable cushion compared to the added seat cushion. But again, for the price of this chair, buying an affordable seat cushion keeps it all within budget.",

                "reviewText": "This chair is fantastic! First, it was super easy to put together. The directions are clear and everything is packaged together and/or labeled and you don't need anything else to assemble. The only part I had a little trouble with was getting the armrests on at the end - trying to see under where the dang holes were lol. I would say it took me 45 mins tops from opening the box to having cleaned up all the wrapping stuff and able to sit in the chair at my desk. A few parts didn't work in certain spots so just try them in a different similar spot and then they worked fine. I saw someone else comment about the wheels - sometimes they just popped right in, sometimes not, tried a different hole and it was fine. They are technically the same but if you're struggling, just try it in a different 'same' spot and chances are it will work. It is somewhat heavy but I was able to do it all myself. I did prop it up on an ottoman when assembling parts of the seat before it was on the base of the chair.This chair is so comfortable - I literally can't believe how comfortable it is. I was skeptical about the mesh-only seat - SUPER comfortable! The lumbar support makes it easy to sit up straight. The chair is super solid. The blade wheels are so smooth. I haven't even had it for a week so I will update later if there are any changes. I have the navy blue which you can see in the pictures is very dark (which I like). I haven't spent much time leaning in it either so if there's a change to my rating based on that, I will post that as well. Some have complained about the seat bed being \"short\" - I thought so at first too. To sit comfortably you need to sit all the way back in the seat and it's perfect. I asked a question that never really got answered. As you can see it fits fine underneath my desk. I am 5'8\" though and have it on the lowest possible setting to sit comfortably. So I'm wondering for those who are different heights can really adjust this to where they would want it to be to have their legs sitting perpendicular and your feet able to touch the floor.I work from home and so sit many hours in front of the computer at my desk. This chair finally has made a difference (and I have been through MANY desk chairs over the years). I read countless reviews before picking this chair on amazon and on the internet in general. So glad I chose this ergonomic chair. My back and shoulders DO NOT ACHE after hours (with short breaks throughout) of sitting in it. It was 100% worth the splurge. I live in Las Vegas and so I was only interested in a mesh chair - found out the hard way how much heat other types of chairs generate here particularly in the long hot summer. Personally I don't think you will regret the purchase if you get this chair!",
