It was simple to assemble and it\u2019s perfect for an accent chair in our guest room. The cushion is firm - it may not be comfortable for a long period of time (I haven\u2019t tested that) - but with pillows and a blanket it can be cozy. The style is nice and it is a substantial piece.",

                "reviewText": "It was easy to assemble and looks nice, but if you're looking for something super comfy, this ain't it. The seat is hard, not very cushioned. There is a cushion but not the type you're going to sink into. Not soft and squishy at all. Think dining room chair. The shape of the chair around your body is comfortable enough, but I would expect my ass to go numb after sitting in it for long periods. The ottoman is sturdy as well. I don't weigh much but I sat on it and it holds me no problem. For the price, it suits my needs.",
