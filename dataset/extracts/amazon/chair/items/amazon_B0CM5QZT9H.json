I did need someone to hold the chair at one point though when getting screws in so may be tricky to assemble solo.The chair is sturdy I do not feel like it is going to break or sway when I sit in it, however. I read a review about the armrests being annoying because they do not lock into place and this is 100% accurate.It is pretty annoying but not the end of the world. I like that they can move around there just should be a locking feature so I'm confused about why they lack this seems like common sense.I've already read a ton of reviews on chairs like these that say the but cushion goes flat quickly which will be a bummer when I and anyone else needs to sit in 40 hours a week for work.I'll edit this review after another month or two but so far so good.The wide seat is super comfortable being larger and having larger hips. Finally don't have armrests digging into the side of my thighs!",

I am not a young, strong man and I thought I would not be able to assemble the chair alone. But to my surprise, it was not difficult at all to assemble. Instructions and parts were packaged and labeled clearly. I had to get creative once when connecting the back of the chair to the seat. The chair is very comfortable and roomy. I love love love the armrests. I gave it 4 stars only because I just got it two days ago. I will, maybe, write another review after time has passed to give an update.",

It arrived on the 24th of January which was 6 days ahead of the scheduled delivery date of January 30th.Second, It was very easy to assemble. Everything plus extra bolts was included. The instructions where very easy to follow.As I sit in this chair I like the fact that unlike another chair I got just as the pandemic started. The base is metal and NOT plastic like the iooHug Big and Tall Gaming Chair I brought back in Sept. 2021. I had to get a Chair Base Replacement, when the plastic base wheel broke after getting stuck in a hole my friend made in the floor tile.This Chair also has better back support.",
