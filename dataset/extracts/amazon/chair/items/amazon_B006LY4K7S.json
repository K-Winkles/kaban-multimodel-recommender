                "reviewText": "I was looking for a solutions to set up my Office situation which is completely hard maple hard wood. Since maple seems kinda of easier to get roughed up, I was going back on a large area rug, a carpet rembrandt to cover the whole room and these wheels. Since these wheels are the by the cheapest and easiest option to try I bought these first. They worked great. Smoothly glides accossed the floor without and scratches with ease. I have heard that these type of wheels collect grit on the wheels which can potentially leave marks if they build up. I haven't had them long enough to talk about that. Potential downside is that you have to keep the area and wheels clean. So far not issues smooth cheap way to have wheeled chairs on hardwood. Sure beats buying a custom 12x12 area rug which you would also need a custom anti slip or foam pad for underneath which excepts hardwood floors most PVC slip mates are know to leave a stain on hardwood floors. Anyway I am glad I tried these before I spent that kinda of money. In my opinion you pay all that money for great looking hardwood floor and you have to cover it up with a rug just so its funtional. I would much rather have the smooth rolling rubber wheels for cheap, delivered to my house in 2 days like always through AMAZING PRIME. PS this model is designed for most is not all 5 wheel office chairs, no tool required they pull out and snap in really easy.",

Unknowingly, we had put plastic wheels on our kitchen chairs since we had bought our set, over 25 years ago and they had gouged out several ruts in our Pergo floors. Recently we went to Lowe's and one of their staff, while helping us look for replacement wheels, told us we should try rubber wheels since they would work better on our kitchen chairs. Since Lowe's were out of those wheels, we checked out Amazon, and they had these sets. They were so simple to replace on our chairs, and my chair just glides across the floor with no noise or damage to our floor like the old plastic wheels did. It was a terrific purchase, and very reasonably priced!",

                "reviewText": "I moved to a new location that had wood floors. The wood is not flat like glass. The wood has a slight variation in thickness. I believed it is called scraped wood. The Variation is minimal, not more than 1/8 of an inch if that. Probably more like 1/16. The wood appears to be high quality and expensive. I had put a plastic chair mat on the floor to protect it. These casters guaranteed that they would not damage the floor. They claimed that they were designed specifically for real wood floors. So I picked up the chair mat and put the new casters on my chair. The new casters did not roll as easily as I expected. Perhaps this was due to the softer material the wheels were made from. After a week or so I noticed something was wrong. There was significant damage to the floor. Several small light spots and one large one where the top of the wood had been removed. I believe that the damage was due to the fact that these casters were lower or shorter than the original casters. This resulted in the chair base or \"spider\" was lower than before. The central shaft in the base was too low and damaged the floor as the chair moved. IF YOUR WOOD FLOOR IS NOT PERFECTLY FLAT AND SMOOTH LIKE GLASS DO NOT BUY THESE CASTERS. My office chair is nothing unusual. I bought it at Office Depot. It is a Hon brand. It has a cushioned seat and a net like ventilated back.I have since replaced these inferior casters. When I attempted to remove these, one of the caster shafts remained in the base of the chair and I had to use pliers to remove the shaft. I choose a taller caster. They look like in-line skate or luggage wheels. They were a brand called STEALTHO. They came from Amazon. The new casters also promise no damage to wood floors. The chair post has significantly higher clearance. They Stealtho casters roll more easily.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these to replace the original hard plastic wheels on my office chair. My office floor has porcelain tiles on which hard plastic wheels are not recommended. The manufacturers state that these wheels comprise a specially formulated rubber material that gives a smooth movement whilst protecting tiled or laminated floors. This is confirmed on their website and on the box. They are not polyurethane or any other type of plastic.Rubber wheels ensure a smoother movement than polyurethane wheels, but rubber normally has an increased roll resistance, creating higher user fatigue when moving the chair. However these wheels have a very similar roll resistance and feel to polyurethane. And I am very satisfied with both the roll resistance and smooth operation of these wheels on my chair.They were very easy to fit and don\u2019t need any special tools; the old wheels simply pulled off with a sharp tug. Note that these wheels come with a standard 11mm diameter shaft that fits into the chair. They should fit any chair except those made by IKEA \u2013 which uniquely require a 10mm shaft.",
