                "reviewText": "You might say we are somewhat experts on lower back support. Nobody here is an orthopedic surgeon or anything, but there are lower back situations which have necessitated a plethora of lumbar support cushions over the years. Our general experience has been that lumbar support cushions tend to fall a little short in the area of\u2026well\u2026lumbar support\u2026.Then arrives the ZIKEE Lumbar Support Pillow!! If there were a way to insert angelic choirs with Xenon light beams from on high bathing this product in its Heavenly light, I would put that in. I guess you\u2019ll just have to visualize it. What makes this one so different? This has a very dense memory foam \u201ccore\u201d that provides added support in the critical lumbar zone. It seems a fundamental idea, but only this product has that feature of the many we have tried over time.On the flip side, it is possible this core feature could develop a \u201chot spot\u201d over a lengthy spell - say a long drive or a marathon ZOOM meeting. This would have been helped with a little denser foam surrounding the core - but that is a relatively small thing in my humble opinion. We will accept that to get the added support where it really counts every time.The good: Obviously the lumbar support is the star of this show. In the supporting roles however are very high-quality construction. Sturdy mounting straps (for desk chair). You wouldn\u2019t sling your ruck sack to them or anything but they are of a heavier gauge than most products like this would have.Opportunities to improve: A little denser foam surrounding the core would morph this into an utterly perfect product.Bottom line: About a 9.9 out of a perfect 10 - would get a gold medal in most Olympics. A BARGAIN at the price point it comes in at.",

                "reviewText": "The ZIKEE Lumbar Support Pillow is back saving!The high density memory foam on the inside is really soft and contours to your back providing ample support and coverage. You don't sink into it, it just hold you. I've haven't felt anything this good from the various other back support pillows I've tried. This is honestly the best one I've ever tried!The outside material is breathable on the front and more solid on the back with little dots to prevent slipping. Has two adjustable straps that you can evenly secure to most chairs. I use a folding plastic steel tube frame chair that's open in the middle at my computer desk and I was able to strap it to the top half and it stays. This has instantly made my chair more comfortable!This pillow really feels good. I'm able to sit up more comfortable and improve my posture when eating and working at my desk for long periods.",

                "reviewText": "This item arrived vacuum-sealed and as soon as I removed it from that plastic seal it basically instantly inflated to full form. It didn't require any extra time to reform and set up so I was able to immediately see and get an impression of how it would work.This lower back pillow is a mix of micro-fiber and memory foam. There;'s no weird smell or texture. It feels both soft and yet with a good amount of firmness. When you push down on it with your hand you feel a good amount of sturdiness with a soft 'give'.What I like about this lumbar pillow is that it gives you so many options of locations to use it. You can place it against a hard-back wooden chair, a soft computer chair, a couch, and a car seat. I appreciate that the back of the pillow comes with straps so if you need to you can affix it to any piece of furniture so that it fits perfectly for your body regardless of height.The price for this pillow is excellent and the comfort it provides is pretty satisfying. I'd say this is a good option for anyone suffering from lower back pain.",

In short, it's well built.If you're like me and spend a lot of time working at a desk, this could be very helpful for you. It has certainly worked for me. I will happily rate this at five stars!!!",
