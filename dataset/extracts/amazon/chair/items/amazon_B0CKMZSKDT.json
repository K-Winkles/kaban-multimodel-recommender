If you like firmness, then this chair is for you. I was also disappointed in the actual material covering the chair- it looks like faux leather, but is this cheap unwoven fabric?This chair is made to look nice sitting somewhere, but not for sitting in, at least in my opinion. It does swivel, it does look nice from afar- but if you want comfort, I would look elsewhere. This is just my opinion, as other reviewers seem to like it.It just looks cheap for the price I paid and I like a bit more padding in the rear area. I would be afraid to sit in the chair with a new pair of blue jeans- the dye might ruin the chair.I like the style, but nothing else.",
