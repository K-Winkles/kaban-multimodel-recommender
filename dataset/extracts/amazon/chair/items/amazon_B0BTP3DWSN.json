                "reviewText": "This chair is a solid, relatively cheap option for a desk chair. It is quite comfortable, easy to build, and looks as advertised. However, I will say that I wish it had a bit more give in terms of its flexibility to lean back. Additionally, the armrests are a bit too high for my liking, and they are not adjustable. Overall, this is a solid option for a desk chair, and good value for what you pay. With that said, if you are looking to invest in a chair for the longterm, I would suggest looking at chairs in a higher price range.",

We were four screws short and when messaging the company they said it would be 4 weeks before they could get us the screws... and that was them putting a rush on them! we got the chair within two or three days!

The chair is tilting to the front right side.I don't know what to do. I am in tears. I thought that this was supposed to be a good work chair for long periods of time. I get up for breaks every hour. Then I like to get back to work. I just got this chair this week. I am supposed to love it. However, I don't. I don't know if returning it would be worth it. Or some kind of seating support. It thought that the chair had a tilting lock to help adjust my body. No luck.The back of the chair is not made for people who have a full size bottom, there is no space to sit comfortably. I am a very active person and keep on the move. But when it is time for me to sit to make my money for my home I can't be uncomfortable...Signed frustrated and uncomfortable.",
