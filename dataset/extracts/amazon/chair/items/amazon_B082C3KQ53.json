                "reviewText": "We loved these when they came initially. They were easy to assemble, looked great in our room, and were reasonably comfortable (we placed cushions on the chairs.However, after sitting in them for a few weeks, a few things happened.- The screws locking the legs to the seat loosened causing the seat to flex in odd ways and cracking the plastic.- We noticed the legs will shift and flex based on how you sit in the chair; not very sturdy- If you sit on this wrong, the odds of you falling over are VERY high. Cannot recommend to households with children.Overall we tried to reach out to customer support to talk through the screws loosening and plastic cracking but got no response. It's possible we simply got a bad batch, but combined with the complete lack of customer service I cannot recommend these.",

The chairs I got comes in 2 pieces within a reasonable price point.The plastic mold has a decent fit and quite wide to accommodate people at all sizes. The legs of the chair seems flimsy at first but can be fix by tightening the screws.The main sitting mold is made of plastic so it's easier to clean. The chair design has that 'modern' style to it so be aware of the interior design you are going for (if it matters). I use mine as an accent chair for living and it worked pretty well. The chairs can be use for other purposes as well like for office, dining and/or just an overall chair for outdoors or indoors.Overall, it's a good chair to have. The price is a bit on the lower end but with the right usage and indoor design, it can be flexible and nice to look at.",
