                "reviewText": "Va tutto bene --it's all good.It takes 20min to assemble & all the assembly parts are laid out well, including the screws/bolts (labeled) & provide white gloves (too small for my big hands) plus a handy Allen wrench...I can now sit erect at my home workstation at the precise level that I enjoy, and my dog can spin me around whenever he wants too.It's sturdy and I appreciate the metal foundation and a comfy seat. Watch the short assembly video a couple of times you won't need to use the instruction manual. You get to keep the gloves, the spare parts provided and the neat Allen wrench which provides great leverage (now I can throw away all the Allen wrenches I've accumulated through the ages...)The price is fine too. It's worth every penny, in my estimation.",

                "reviewText": "Everything for me is the perfect size. I\u2019m a slender 5\u2019 10\u201d home office worker and gamer, so i need all-day comfort and mobility. This chair is perfectly sized, very comfortable, not too heavy to move around on carpet, and everything worked right out of the box after assembly.I am, however, knocking a star off because the chair i got (may have been a weird production copy) is off on the measurements where the back rest attaches to the arm rests. I could not get 1 of the 4 screws in because the holes don\u2019t line up. Additionally, one of the screws that attach the headrest to the back rest will not screw in because the socket is not in tight enough so it pops out when you try to tighten the screw. So the headrest will forever be wobbly. All in all, it does not affect anything cosmetically or physically, but it will be a minor annoyance.Other than that, it\u2019s a very good chair. I would definitely recommend it and hopefully you\u2019ll get one without the minor defects that i got.",
