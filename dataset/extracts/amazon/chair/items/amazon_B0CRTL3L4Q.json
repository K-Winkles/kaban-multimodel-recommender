                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I was looking for a new desk chair for work since my old one broke after years of use. I was specifically looking for one with head support, back support, arm rests and this one fit the bill. I like that you can adjust the head rest up and down and also tilt it to match whatever posture you like. I also like the adjustable arm rests, you can fold them away if you choose. The wheels roll very smoothly and the seat is comfortable. I feel that my posture has improved since using this chair for only a few days. The backing is firm and stiff and helps my lower back during long periods of work on the computer.Overall, I recommend this chair for an affordable home office set up. The chair was easy to put together and the instructions were clear. Total set up time was maybe around 30 minutes. The front part of the chair is labeled clearly which really helped since I put together another chair recently and was halfway done before I realized I installed the seat incorrectly. The screws came nicely sorted and it was easy to tell which ones we were supposed to use for each step of the instructions. No screwdriver was required as they include the L shaped screw tool. There were also some extra screws in case one was defective or you needed an extra for some reason. I put this chair together by myself so it should be fairly simple to build.",
