                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been searching for chairs that goes with my white round breakfast table. I\u2019ve tried faux leather chairs (brown), worrying about stain but it didn\u2019t work because the back of the chair was too straight - uncomfortable. Then I tried fabric chairs (round seat and beige color) - it was already stained some when I open it. Then I tried these chairs. It looked so good together and the back of the chair is somewhat flexible so that I can lean back and forth some for comfort. Tge best part about these prodicts are tye price! It\u2019s an unbelievable deal!! One thing to note is that the cushions for the seats are to assemble unlike some other chairs looking like these, it looked a bit flimsy and created some wrinkles on the seat as I assemble. I was unsure about these chairs if it would work out fine, but I didn\u2019t need to worry. Once it\u2019s tightes and done, there is no issue what so ever to use/sit on. :)",
