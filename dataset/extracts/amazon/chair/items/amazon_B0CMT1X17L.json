                "reviewText": "As someone who's 5'10\" and 248lbs, having had three operations on a very sensitive part of my body in the past five months, finding the right chair isn't just a matter of comfort\u2014it's a necessity! Enter the COLAMY Big and Tall Office Chair, a game-changer in every sense.First off, the size and build of this chair are a dream come true. The dimensions (33.66\"D x 33.46\"W x 49\"H) offer ample space, and it's not just about width; the depth ensures that even a taller individual can sit back comfortably without feeling cramped.The extra-wide seat is a standout feature. It's not just wide; it's smartly designed. At my height I can comfortably fold my legs on the chair. You can feel the thoughtful engineering that went into creating a seat that supports without confining, ideal for those with a bit more to love!Now, let's talk comfort. After my surgeries, I was cautious about any chair, but the thick seat cushioning on this COLAMY chair is like sitting on a cloud. It's firm enough to offer support yet soft enough to avoid any of my sensitive pressure points\u2014a delicate balance achieved perfectly.The high back and adjustable lumbar support are like the cherry on top. The ergonomic design ensures that my back is supported correctly, crucial for long hours at the desk. The tilt rock function adds that extra bit of customizable comfort, allowing me to find the perfect angle for my needs.The chair's durability is evident from the moment you sit in it. It's built to hold up to 500lbs, and you can feel the sturdiness. There's a sense of security in knowing that this chair won't buckle under pressure.In conclusion, the COLAMY Big and Tall Office Chair is an absolute winner. It's not just a chair; it's a fortress of comfort and support. Whether you're tall, carrying extra weight, or have medical considerations like me, this chair doesn't just meet the needs\u2014it exceeds them. Highly recommend!P.S. The sleek black design is just the icing on the cake, stylish enough for any office setting! Parts were exact with a spares compartment included, plus the instructions were easy to follow.",

                "reviewText": "i'll be fully honest, i am an extremely large (morbidly obese) person. i was looking for a chair that hopefully wouldn't break on me within the first few months of having it AND fit my budget, and it might possibly be this chair. i just got it though so we will see. i am EXTREMELY large in both the booty and hips area and i was able to sit comfortably in this chair. it is just slightly tight around my big thighs but that's kind of to be expected with just how bottom-heavy i am, i doubt i would be able to actually find a chair wide enough unless it didn't have arm rests, which i wanted arm rests lol. it's very padded on both the seat and the back, which, speaking of the back, it IS indeed VERY stiff and difficult to lean back in. a foot rest will solve this issue, which is really a non-issue because i rarely lean back, but keep that in mind if you are looking for a reclining chair. i'm around 5 foot 8 and this chair is not too short for me. love it so far.",

                "reviewText": "I have a lot to say about this Colamy big and tall chair. It feels very heavy duty, every part feels like a quality piece of furniture. The box showed up and was very large and very heavy. The UPS driver was not looking forward to bringing it to the third floor. When you're sitting in it, it really feels like a couch as far as comfort. It's very spacious and comfortable in every way. The seat is spacious and thick, the inflatable lumbar support is fabulous, and the wide arms are very comfortable. I'm disabled. and feel that not only is this chair great for big and tall. (500# capacity) but also easy to climb in and out of. If you needed a chair that you could climb from a wheelchair into, I feel that you will be happy with the size and sturdiness of this chair. With all the pros of this chair and not finding any cons, why didn't I give this chai 5 stars? I'll answer that for you. This chair is worth 5 stars, the best one I have found in my 62 years. But this one had a cut in the seat and don't see how it got there. The box was in good shape and wasn't cut in any way. Must of happened before it was boxed from manufacturing. There is no way I can get this anywhere even if I could box it back up to send it back, a piece of black duct tape will have to suffice and I hope the cut doesn't expand and get larger. I hope this review was helpful to you. I used a picture from the web so you would know exactly what chair I was talking about because I couldn't take a picture atm. This chair is worth the money and I would defiantly purchase it again and request the tear not to be there LOL.",

                "reviewText": "Not a bad chair, my issues are twofold:1. The off gassing is bad. It has an overwhelming \"new car\" smell that will stick to your skin. My recommendation is to air it out for a day or two before use.2. The assembly instructions were non-existent, meaning either not provided or missing. It wasn't so difficult that I couldn't figure out how to assemble it without instructions but it was annoying to not have them.Aside from that it is a comfortable chair. I'll try to update at the 6 month mark if anything changes.",
