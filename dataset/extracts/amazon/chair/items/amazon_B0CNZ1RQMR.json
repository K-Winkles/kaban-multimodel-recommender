                "reviewText": "I needed an office chair without arms so that I could play guitar at my desk. This one fit the bill and was priced right.Assembly is pretty easy. The hardest part is the first step, assembling the base. You put it together upside-down. Make sure the legs are oriented properly. It doesn\u2019t require as much force as it might seem. You just have to wiggle each leg into position until it seats enough that you can fold it down. Folding will snug them into place. After that, it\u2019s only a matter of pressing in the wheels, 3 socket head bolts for the back rest, and 4 under the seat. It\u2019s nice that there is a cover to pop on the back that hides the bolts. It\u2019s a good looking chair.Comfort is OK. I wouldn\u2019t want to use it all day, but it\u2019s fine for my home desk. Height is the only adjustment. It raises and lowers without difficulty. I like the way it feels at its highest setting (I\u2019m 5\u2019 11\u201d). There is a little side-to-side play. The cushion is some sort of memory foam. I can feel it sculpting to my sitz bones. It\u2019s not bad, but kind of an unusual feeling. I can imagine it wearing out in those spots. The mesh of the back rest is firm and supportive. Unfortunately, I can feel the top edge of the rest digging into my back, just below my shoulder blades, if I lean back. It\u2019s better for sitting up straight. The wheels are basic carpet casters, but it rolls smoothly. It\u2019s also lightweight, if you need to pick it up and move it.",

Just have to remember to be more careful in my senior years. Very reasonable price for a comfy little chair. It\u2019s adjustable up and down so I found my spot. Back is comfortable to sit at for awhile. The construction seems sturdy and it doesn\u2019t wobble. Also, my cat loves it and I have to share.At first I really liked the fact that it was so lightweight, but I think that might have something to do with it slipping away from me so easily with just a tap. Could be a problem if you\u2019re not ready for it. Might be better on a carpeted floor than a hardwood or tile.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very comfortable office-style chair. It's super easy to put together with minimal effort but feels very secure and supportive. The up/down tab is nicely concealed under the chair so there is no risk of snagging or accidentally pushing it. It can hold my weight just fine (220 lbs) without loss of pressure or height decrease over time so far. The padding itself is very comfortable, and the mesh backing feels nice. There aren't arms and the recline isn't adjustable, but I feel like it is a very good balance still of support vs lean when you put your weight back on it. All in all, I wouldn't use it as an everyday/all-day chair, but I do think it's great for guests or a back-up chair if ever needed. Would still recommend for sure. Great quality for the price!",
