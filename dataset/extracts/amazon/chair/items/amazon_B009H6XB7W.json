                "reviewText": "I put this thing together last night, only used it once but so far I'm pretty impressed for the price point. I'm 5' 9\" @ 175lbs, I typically use a 45lb plate when doing Hyperextensions, and I have used the more expensive $300 Body Solid 45 degree hyper and commercial ones at LA Fitness. Surprised to say that this thing actually holds its own with the others, very solid and stable! Biggest surprise was the steel thickness, this thing actually has a decent quality feel and once everything was put together and tightened down I felt almost ZERO movement from the Hyper. Being a male, my biggest concern was the front pad not being split, but on the lowest height setting I can honestly say it was comfortable and I don't see any need to add towels to protect the \"McNuggets\" LOL. There were some little blemishes from shipping, the rollers had some dents in the foam (will probably expand with time), and the bolts/washers were cheap, but overall nothing worth complaining about there.PROS1) For the price, this thing cant be beaten. It is VERY sturdy and functional for lower back and hamstrings!2) Two knobs on the main support, once both are tightened down there is ZERO wobble.3) Adjustable rear roller pad (Height, and distance from the main support)4) Foldable! I have a garage gym, space is precious, being able to hang this on a wall is AWESOME!5) Decent finish, but you are paying less than $80, don't expected a commercial chip resistant paint job.6) Fairly simple assembly, probably took 15-20 minutes to get everything level.Assembly Tip: Same way you would assemble any piece of fitness equipment, DO NOT fully tighten everything down from the beginning. I put all the bolts on and the hyper was visibly crooked at first, an amateur may think its just a piece of junk and try to return it. Assemble the machine tightening to hand strength on a flat surface, then adjust the machine to a comfortable position and lightly test it out, this will help get it level on the floor. After it feels level then go back and make sure everything looks straight and tighten making little adjustments where needed.CONS (Most Nit Picky)1) No footplate. Honestly though, I don't think it REALLY needs one. My feet rests easily on the back support, no biggie.2) Bottom feet of the front and rear supports are plastic and were slightly bent front shipping. It doesn't affect the stability, nothing to get upset about and I'm sure I could call Stamina for some replacements. Not worth it to me.3) Main pad is a little on the thin side, after continual years of abuse I can see it being the only thin that may need reconditioned or replaced. Heck, by that point I'm sure a towel would suffice.4) Made for tall people: I'm 5' 9\" and the lowest height setting is absolutely perfect for me, I can rest my feet firmly against the bottom support and get good range of motion! If you are shorter than that, you might have to modify and have your feet suspended off the ground resting against the foam rollers (which is fine). Or drill another hole into the main support, which would take you less than a couple minutes to accomplish and might help those who are a couple inches shorter.Final verdict, I got a discount on the price due to Amazon points but I believe even at full price I would definitely purchase again. Of course the Body Solid Hyperextensions are amazing, but at 3x-4x less I'm still getting the same end result yet I can fold this one up and stick it in a corner when not in use. If you have limited space (apartment or garage gym), and are looking for a good way to add a workout to your lower back and hamstrings, then I don't see how you could possibly go wrong with this piece of equipment.",

                "reviewText": "The 45 degree back hyperextension is a really versatile piece of equipment for strengthening the posterior chain, all the way from your hamstrings to your glues to your spinal erectors. There's a paper you can find online called \"Are All Hip Extension Exercises Created Equal\" which shows why this piece of equipment is unique. Unlike a vertical movement (stiff leg deadlift or good morning) or a horizontal movement (roman chair) the 45 degree bench requires muscular tension throughout the entire range of movement. It also just feels good to hang off of.I used to use one at the gym (remember those?) and although I dislike exercise equipment at home, I decided this would be a good buy. This is definitely something which is easier to buy than it is to DIY.The product itself is made from decently thick powder coated steel, with what look like decent welds. There is some rocking due to the fact that my old wooden floors are very uneven, but the bench itself is quite sturdy. I'm not sure if I'd trust the dip bars, not because the welds look bad, but just because there isn't a ton of weight keeping the thing from flipping over if you apply weight all the way out. Adjustments are made with a spring loaded adjustment pin, and another screw down pin to make it all solid.I didn't see reviews on the size. I am a fairly leggy 6'3, and when full extended the bench is too long for me. I would be more concerned about being too short, but if you are of average height you should have no problem with the length. One improvement I would like to see is the width. It is nice to spread your legs a bit for better glute activation, but the supplied ankle support is pretty narrow. This could be easily fixed with a piece of pipe, however. The padding is just okay - certainly not as cushy as a commercial machine but I also don't find it uncomfortable.Regarding size in the room, it's pretty big when unfolded but when folded it's fairly compact. You won't slide it under a couch but it will lean nicely against the wall.Packaging was nice; coming in a surprisingly small box. Assembly instructions were about normal for offshore workout equipment - clear enough but I managed to get two things backwards. Fortunately it's fairly obvious when you've gotten something wrong, and there is a very limited number of fasteners used. I like that it comes with little plastic covers for all the nuts, which really adds to the appearance.I'll see how it holds up, but after a few uses I'm happy.*Update*After more use and adjustment, the machine really is uncomfortable. It's not just the lack of a gap for my particular anatomy, but the top is fairly hard. I can work around this with a pillow or towel, but better padding design would make this a 5/5 for me.",

                "reviewText": "I've used machines at the gym like this for years... really works well to strengthen and stretch the lower back. This unit works great and is really sturdy - especially considering the price. I had no trouble putting it together.One star subtracted because is just slightly too big for me (I am 5ft 6 in)... meaning - the pad impedes my ability to bend over it because of where my hips fit on the pad. I have the machine set at it's shortest setting. The machines I've used at the gym I usually have had set to the 2nd to the shortest setting. Therefore, I would not recommend this product for anyone shorter than 5ft 5 inches... But if you are taller than me - highly, highly recommend.If for some reason you might want to return this product ...I believe it would be difficult because of the way it was packed. It was packed very well - but it's hard to believe all the pieces fit in such a small box ...and I'm absolutely sure I couldn't put fit them all back in if I had to disassemble the machine for return.For the manufacturer -- the pad is indeed a little hard (as other reviewers have indicated). I tried adding some padding of my own on top, but then I couldn't use the machine because it made my short stature an even bigger issue... But, the padding is not that big of a problem.",

Got the package on time and well packaged. Each piece was individually wrapped in plastic to avoid scratches to the paint (lovely blue red color by the way) & the sharper ends had cardboard taped over them to avoid puncturing through the box and damaging the other parts. So easy to put together even with one person & the tools you require are all provided. Very sturdy and no wobbling about. I'm quite short and would have liked the pad to go down a bit further but still can do the exercises very comfortably. Adjustable for you taller people as well.",

It sits solidly on the floor and does not tip over like some other machines I have ordered previously. It is a bit lower than the one at the gym but it does what the manufacturers say it should do. There was no false advertising on this one! You can do different exercises on it. I tried them. This machine feels like good quality stuff and it is worth every penny. I would highly recommend this machine for working back, hips and glutes. I used to wake up with hip and lower back pain because of not going to the gym but I thank God every single day for this machine which has come to my rescue! Honestly, you won't regret buying it.",

Probably 30-40 minutes for an average person I imagine.The product itself I find to be pretty sturdy not like anything you'll find at the gym of course.But good. I use the lowest setting and am 5'10 I'm not sure how short once can be to use it. Maybe 5'8 the shortest?I was mostly worried about the issue without there being a gap for men. But if you spread your legs to give your junk somewhere to go there shouldn't be any issue. I find it most uncomfortable doing sit ups on it always need some adjusting.Took me a while to get comfortable with the thought that this tiny piece of metal wouldn't collapse during a workout, but now it's earned my trust. I'm only 160 and have used some weight with it and no trouble.I'd recommend it to anyone who want's a cheap but effective bench to build an all around strong core.",

Maybe mine just had perfect holes drilled, but I put it all together myself in less than an hour.I am 5'8\" and had to use the higher foot holder setting along with the second lowest hip placement setting. So your height will be a huge factor in buying.It doesn't wobble or anything for me. The feet are pretty much level and it doesn't move around or feel unsafe.It shouldn't be quite so expensive, so maybe wait for a sale. But it is not cheap feeling.If you want this for glute exercises then I see no reason not to unless you think it's too expensive.There are some YouTube videos about people using it, so watch them if you need more convincing.",
