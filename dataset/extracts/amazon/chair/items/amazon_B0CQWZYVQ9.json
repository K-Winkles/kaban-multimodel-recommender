Chair came well packaged and took a whole 5 minutes to put together. I was surprised that it fit me, I\u2019m 6\u20191\u201d 215lbs, and I was pleasantly surprised that it has a pretty decent build quality to it. I went ahead and screwed the caster wheels to the bottom of the frame and viola! I created a nice plush gaming chair! The massage feature is kind of a cheap gimmick but some may find it useful.",

Really comfortable. 8 very different vibration modes patterns, with speed variations. Took less than three minutes to set up. A monkey could do it. If you're a bigger person, it's probably not for you though. I'm 6'2\" 220. I still fit fine, but it could be a little bit bigger. If you're smaller than that you will have no problems. In my experience, the electronics in any of these usually go bad sooner than later. Also you tend not to use the electronics as much, so not a big deal. Just got it today and it's great. No problems so far. Great value for the money. John in Cincinnati.",

                "reviewText": "My husband has been asking for one of these for a while. I was hesitant to purchase one because they are usually bulky and heavy. After reading the reviews I purchased this one and am so glad I did. As is noted, the assembly is easy. Just two pieces, with the back easily sliding into the base. It is a little more compact so keep that in mind when considering size. Also, there are two different ways to 'recline'. The first is your standard feet up and leaning back slightly. The second is more of a full extension reclining (Think lying down). Again, not bad in any way, just something to consider. The massage is a great bonus, and for the price it can't be beat!",
