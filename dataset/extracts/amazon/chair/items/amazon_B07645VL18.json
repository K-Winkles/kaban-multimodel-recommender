                "reviewText": "The quality of this chair is very good and it is extremely comfortable (to me anyway). It offer excellent support for your back and is an attractive design. The biggest challenge is in assembly. The instructions say to attach the arms to the seat 1st then bolt the back on. When you follow this procedure, the holes on the back don't line up. My suggestion is, loosely bolt the arms to the back, then bolt the arms to the seat. Other than that, It's a great chair.",

Some holes were sunk way in the fabric making the arms not sit right. The entire chair was crooked after it was put together. Leaned to one side. I was also expecting great comfort since this is a serta not the case use it was soft and had cushion but not a lot of support. Returned and after alot if research ordered another chair Clatina Mellet cheaper price and way better support and made way better. Would not recommend this serta chair",

I just wish the manufacturing process was better, and the customer service was better.If I don't get the replacement cushion in the next week, I'll be returning it to amazon for a refund.",

Quality of materials seems appropriate for this price range. This chair tempted me as soon as I saw it (I'm a sucker for good design). For my body type (I'm 5' 8\" and 145 lbs) the chair is very comfortable for bum, back and arms. As I do a lot of reading at my computer, I need soft and relatively substantial armrests which this chair has. My only disappointment is that the headrest is too far back and as it is not adjustable, for me it's really of little use unless I add a pillow and slide my bum forward. I live in a smallish town so couldn't test a lot of chairs in person so did what research I could online and then ordered through Amazon. My first choice had to be returned (uncomfortable). If you live in a larger city and can shop in person, I'd certainly recommend doing that regardless of who you buy from.",
