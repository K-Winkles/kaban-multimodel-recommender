Recommend installing the screw on both sides of chair back and tightening both in increments until tight to be even on both sides. When I assembled mine, the left arm is slightly higher than the right. Unsure if this is due to how I tightened them or if manufacturing defects. Really comfy! Has built in lumbar support. The headrest just stretches around the top of chair. Don\u2019t tighten anything extremely tight as most of the pieces are plastic and can crack with use.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this chair after my old one gave out, mostly because of the style and the price tag associated. It is a build it up yourself, and the parts seemed fairly adequate in quality. The fabric isn't really leather, more of a plastic type covering over foam. One of the arm rests already had a split in it which was not reassuring for longevity. The assembly itself wasn't too bad, the most trouble I had was getting the last few screws in place for the backrest, holding it in place while trying to thread the screw was slightly irritating. All in all, doesn't seem to be too bad of a chair, as a 6', 220lb man it supports me well and I can recline in it without feeling like it is going to drop me on the floor. It is fairly comfortable though the back support feels unnatural at first but I got used to it as I reclined and generally relaxed in the chair as I used my PC.Long story short: good enough for the money you pay for a stylish, somewhat comfortable chair.",

                "reviewText": "My chair is still sitting in pieces on the floor, after making a new attempt each day for three days. The bottom (metal) comes together very easily, and it took me about ten minutes for all of it, if that. The top and seat of the chair are then held together by only the arms of the chair, by four screws, two on each side (I am not optimistic about the durability of these four screws holding a back on a chair as someone moves around and puts their weight against it to begin with. The next problem is that the four holes that attach the arms and thus hold the entire upper chair together are very poorly drilled. I tried putting the screws in the holes with the hand tool they provide and a drill, and they don't want to go in. I tried just putting the screw in the hole to see if I was getting a bad angle, but they really don't want to go in the hole without the arm between it. They seem to have been generally drilled very haphazardly, and if you don't get the exact angle, it doesn't go in. If you do get the right angle, and the pieces shift (which they almost always will, especially if you're working by yourself, as you are holding together two weighty pieces that are secured in no way, until those screws get started, then you won't be able to get the screw in; and you'll have to pull it back and find the passage again. On top of that, because the screw holes are drilled how they are, it is very easy, much easier than getting it in the socket, to get the screw to go off at an angle and just screw into the padding of the chair. I have been working on this upper for over two hours, and I've gotten one screw in (loosely, so I can still move the pieces); and I'm frankly beginning to worry that the pressure of wrestling with the chair over and over to get in the other three (or just the next one) is going to end up snapping it off on the socket.The chair shows it being able to recline and adjust a few inches, but I really see nothing on the chair that could possibly make this possible (unless their photographing the slow progress of the chair back breaking off, because it's only held by four screws that don't want to find the socket with a map and a local guide). This chair will most likely be renamed by me to be \"That time I paid $50 to take something to the trash room\", because without paying someone to do it, I don't think I will ever be able to get it together.I watched the video. It doesn't work. I read the reviews that said it was easy to put together, and their suggestions didn't work (and I'm wondering if they were paid now). I would return it, but after having worked in an office for years and having put together numerous desk chairs, I was sure it would be no issue and threw out the box and shipping materials. I guess, it is mine now. My millstone.To grant the star I gave it, if the pieces went together, which they don't, it would be a nice looking chair. It would be roomy. The padding seems comfortable. But it doesn't. It lays on the floor in pieces.If you ever ask why a chair costs so much less than the others, there is a reason.",

                "reviewText": "Excellent Gamer chair, all prisoner/product.Generally:It is comfortable, of good back space to rest, with a comfortable seat. If your budget is reduced, this is a great option, 100% recommended.Pros:100% price/quality.Comfortable, good finishes, variety of colors.Folding descasabrazos in case you have a table that can hinder.The cloth leather finish is appreciated, which helps a lot in the seat, the gamers spent a lot Much butt. But well, this cilla has fabric + skin (simulated, I don't know the name, but you already understand the idea)Cons:It seems that the support is going to break because it does not have a metallic support, the support that the back is only two plastic arms, they will surely break if you make a abrupt movement or there are two people who recharge in it ( you understand).The rests are comfortable, however if you rely on the extreme, it shows how your arms stress, so it is not advisable to rely from them to get up.It is not reclining, at the base it has an adjustment that makes the back and the base move together, however this does not imply a recline as such, which is not advisable to leave it loose, and less with a back support from plastic.Attention !! .. The manual is poorly designed, and I see that because of this, some people have broken the support of the rest that is the same back support.First they must assemble that support and then to the seat, and for nothing in the world they are fully adjusted before having the 4 anchored screws or puts in the seat and in the sword. Contrary at some point and goodbye and goodbye. What they have to do is, once the 4 screws pointed out is to press them little by little until they have a even adjustment in the 4 screws (no matter that some enter more than others) the pressure adjustment must be equitable in all in all The screws, in the opposite way that plastic base is broken. Another important point, while my feet are just on the ground, my head is on the back (I measure 1.70m) if you are taller your head would be left outdoors and feet on the ground, and with the aforementioned of the Freagil From the reslication, it is something to consider.",
