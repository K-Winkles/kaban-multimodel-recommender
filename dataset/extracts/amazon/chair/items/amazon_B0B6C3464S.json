The seat is deep so that the underside/hamstrings are supported and is definitely on the wide side. I am 6'4\" and 280 lbs and I have plenty of width (the width of the arm rests can be adjusted a bit during assembly). The product arrived well packed with simple instructions. I took me about 30 minutes. The best part of having a mesh backrest is that the assembly was easy since I did not have to press together a padded back to the padded seat which can be a struggle without assistance. I like the lumbar dial on the back and the lever below the seat, for raising/lowering the seat and locking/unlocking the rocking motion works well. The only down side is even though the seat is well cushioned, the memory foam is quite firm, so don't expect a plush spongey surface....this could also be a plus as it may hold its shape over time for heavier individuals.",

                "reviewText": "I decided to spend more $ on this chair than I've ever spent before on one, only to deeply regret it. Complete waste of my money as the chair is useless for me. This chair was easy to put together, is very stable, has metal parts where other chairs have cheap plastic and has a nice (very) wide seat. HOWEVER-the manufacturers seem to have completely forgotten the \"TALL\" part of \"big and tall\" when I measure from the bottom of the seat to the floor, with chair in the highest position, it is only 16''. I am right at 6' tall with a mobility disability and getting up from this chair is almost impossible and intensely painful. If you're a large person who is not over 6' ft this chair may work great for you! But I'm out an awful lot of money for a chair that is not functional for me.",
