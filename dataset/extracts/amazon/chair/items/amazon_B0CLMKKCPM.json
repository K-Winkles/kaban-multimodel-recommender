                "reviewText": "I am sitting on this chair as I write this review. I\u2019ve been using it for a few days now with long hours of gaming. Overall I want to say how great of a chair this is. I\u2019ve ran through many gaming chairs in the past as I play lots of games but I feel that this is the one I will be keeping it as long as it holds. From the moment I got the package to the very assembling of it felt pretty smooth and straight forward. Here is my personal opinion and breakdown of the chair:PROS- Well packaged, delivered quickly and in great condition.- The parts of the chair feel very high quality. No loose threads or scratches. Much better than expected, especially at this price point.- Assembly was a breeze as advertised which took me around 10-15min. All tools and instructions included.- Chair had a pretty good weight to it, and the faux leather felt very sturdy and smooth.- Although being an all black gaming chair, I loved how some parts of the chair is made of different textures like carbon fiber. The details are well thought out.- The seat cushion was very roomy and right amount of plushiness for me. Being a bigger guy I often have problems when sitting for longer periods, but pleasantly surprised.- The padded armrests felt very comfortable and sturdy.- Reclining worked perfect and smoothly. It doesn\u2019t feel wobbly.CONS- I haven\u2019t been able to use the footrest much as I am not a footrest type of guy, and it\u2019s a tad short for myself. But I can say that it is a nice feature to have.- Doesn\u2019t recline all the way, I assume it\u2019s more gaming chair physics than anything.- I prefer the chair without the cushions on it except when I am reclined.TL;DRWell constructed chair that not only looks great but feels comfortable as well. Easy assembly and great value.",

                "reviewText": "This chair is quite sturdy and well made overall. It looks and feels high quality. There was a defect in the backrest I received first and their customer support responded to my report with options to make things right within minutes.Couldn't be happier with any chair below $300, because this is comparable in quality to the $500 chairs we purchased for our e-sports center. It's missing some top-end bells and whistles, and the plastic in the armrests is noticable, but this chair is the highest value I can imagine at this price point. Could easily go for $200 or more.Assembly is straightforward, but takes a bit of effort.",
