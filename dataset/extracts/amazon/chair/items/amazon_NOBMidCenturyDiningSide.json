It's also nice looking.It's tricky to assemble and as others have pointed out, make sure you have the front and rear panels oriented correctly or the screws will not insert properly. The two \"eyes\" on the panels must be facing outward and the screws go in the sunken drilled holes.The arms did not fit under the kitchen table by about a quarter inch so we got some rubber risers for the table - problem solved.I bought two of these so to me it was worth it.",
