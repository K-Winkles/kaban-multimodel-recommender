                "reviewText": "This chair is to replace an older chair that had simply worn out over a span of about 15 years of use. I was looking for a quick, budget minded replacement and then will spend probably weeks looking at a higher quality chair, with full high back. At this price, I was not expecting a high quality chair, and that is what I got. It is more or less easy to assemble. It can be a bit tricky when assembling the arm rest. I loosely attached the back two bolts, then the seat. I did the same on the other side, and then tightened them in sequence : Outer back and outer seat bolts, then inner back and inner seat screws. The threads on the back and seat frame are pre-machined but with very little tolerance so you need to be careful not strip them out if you start them at even just a slightly off-angle. Assembling the base and height adjustment assembly went much easier. The chair has a metal inner frame, and base is also metal (there is some wood on the inside sides of the back and perhaps inside the seat). There is some plastic in the base assembly, but that is only cosmetic. Armrest frames are plastic as well. I also replaced the wheels with higher grade wheels I already had on hand (these have a slightly wider tread as well as slightly larger diameter). Finally I went back through and retightened all the screws, taking care not to overtighten. Assembly completion from opening the box to final check was about 30 minutes.The faux leather covering is what you would expect in a chair at this price range. The seat padding is very firm (too firm?) but not uncomfortable for me, but will have to see how it feels after a long session at my computer. The biggest disappointment is the nearly hollow back with NO filling or padding (this is where the parts are stored when shipped). Very little to no support! I had a large bag of batting I was going to use for another project in the near future but decided to stuff it into the back (the bottom has a zipper ... remember, this is where the parts were stored). I took care to install the batting evenly, taking care not to overstuff. It made a big difference. The other disappointment was that, although listed as a mid-back chair, it is just barely that. Many other chairs (higher price) typically have at least a 24\" inside back length for a mid-size chair back, as measured from the top of the seat ... this one is 22\" The seat depth could have been maybe and inch deeper, as many chairs at this price have (this chair at 17.75\" is barely enough). I am 5'11\" and wight about 190 lbs. If you are taller or heavier, this chair might not work well for you. (My daughter, who is medium build at 5' 7\" thought it was comfortable for her). So here is my summary:PRO: Good price. Seems to be sturdy enough with full metal frame and base. Assembly a bit tricky but just need to be patient and have good lighting.CONS: Seat depth a bit too short. Back offers little to no support without some fill (DIY).So overall, this will do until I can spend some time to look at chairs in person, with better overall quality.",

                "reviewText": "The chair was easy to assemble, all parts were identified by number or letter in the packaging. Then shown in the instructions, to ensure you're using the proper part for assembly. Took me about 20 minutes to put it together.The chair is comfortable, honestly more comfortable than I thought it would be. Helps with posture, padding is firm in some areas such as lower back yet other parts of the chair are cushiony. Chair moves around easily even while seated in it, wheels work well. Arm rests are at a good height, makes them comfortable along with the padding.Also, with my previous chair, some times I'd get circulation to my leg issues. So far with this new chair, all is good. I'd recommend the chair at the price that it is.",

                "reviewText": "I was a little worried about buying this due to the negative reviews but realized they were all mostly around assembly. If you \"loose\" fit all the bolts and use your fingers to get them started, there is absolutely no issues putting this together (if you can't get them started by hand then you've cross threaded them so stop and attempt again). It took me about 10 minutes total. There we some complaints about the back being too hard but I didn't experience this and found it comfortable. I'm using a mesh lumbar support anyway to ensure I keep good posture as well as keep good airflow around my back. My biggest plus on this is the low profile of the armrest and that I can put myself at the correct height and the armrests will slide under my desk. For those wonder at the lowest seat level the height from the ground to top of the armrest is 26.5\" and at the highest seat level, 30\". Seat is very comfortable as well. Good job on this one Amazon!",
