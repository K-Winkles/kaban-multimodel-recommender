                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Versatile, Comfortable Chair with Excellent Customer Service",
                "reviewText": "Overall:- Adjustments include: armrests, tension, reclining angle, lumbar support, height, and different angles/heights for the headrest.- Assembled alone in under an hour, back-up hardware included as a thoughtful touch.- Two right-armrests does not make a chair, but great customer service helps make that right.Rating: 4.75/5 for some small stipulations of quality.Appearance: It\u2019s simple and attractive without too many bells and whistles, perhaps the protruding bar of the headrest feels a bit odd though that may just be my preference.Assembly: This is something that most people would be able to put together themselves within an hour or so; the necessary hardware is all laid out into a small package (a photo of which some others have included) clearly labeled with letters and designations that line up with the instructional booklet. Said instructional booklet also has photos of the corresponding parts you\u2019ll need for each step, and kindly caps-locked warnings about sections where things might get a little wonky. It\u2019s clear and easy to read, even with small grammatical errors here and there. (And this is coming from someone not very technically inclined.)Customer Service: I can speak to firsthand experience with the customer service team. I received two right armrests in my original package, I reached out to the included email about getting me a left-armrest and they got back to me within around 24-hours. If I remember this was near the Easter weekend as well, and yet the response was still timely. They got my shipping information, reconfirmed that I did have two right armrests through photo, and then sent out a tracking number for my missing part. Aside from that, there\u2019s still a five year warranty in play that comes with the chair, and I\u2019m willing to believe they\u2019ll honor it based on my interaction with them thusfar.Comfort and Ergonomics: Like I mentioned in my brief bullet-points, there\u2019s a number of different adjustments that can be made to the chair itself. They\u2019re thoughtful and considerate. Perhaps not as expansive as everyone would need, though more than enough for my purposes. The cushion on both the armrests and the chair bottom itself is plush and comfortable. I think the material of the cushions, being leather, is a bit less breathable than the mesh back-rest, but the plushness makes up for that and it\u2019s nothing that a blanket can\u2019t fix. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d like the headrest, being of a shorter height (a few inches over five feet) I expected that it\u2019d be too high for me to even use. Surprisingly, it does adjust low enough that I can comfortably use it in a wide range of positions, and the transfer from angles happens naturally. I used the chair for hours on end, and I couldn\u2019t complain about it at the end of the day, as opposed to others, so it passes my checks for comfort.Value: At the full price point, there are a few small quips that I think leave it as a four out of five for me. In one of my photos, you can see a protruding metal part, that is meant to be where one of the screws for the headrest should go, and it should be built flush into the plastic, not at a place where it might jab into my back or neck with a bit too much leaning, and a thin mesh film separate. I used a slightly longer screw (one of the spares for a different part) and it held the headrest tight, or else it would have wobbled with the intended screw. Where the headrest sits for me, I don\u2019t anticipate it being an issue since there\u2019s two layers of protection, though it\u2019s not the best vouch of quality control. I tested the wheels on both wood floor and the carpet of my office. Maybe it\u2019s because they\u2019re new, but it moves a bit like that odd-cart in a grocery store that has a tendency to drift. Aside from that, the lumbar support feels a bit flimsy, given that it is only a piece of plastic, but it has made me more conscious of my own posture. In general, all the adjustments that you can make all have this feeling of being a bit, loosey-goosey. The armchairs flip up, and they stay, though there\u2019s something about the motion that doesn\u2019t quite have a full clickiness that gives me the sense they\u2019re secure and will stay that way for long. Likewise changing your reclining angle and tilt feels a bit odd even though the lock itself seems secure. The metal and leather portions of the chair feel well-made though, and I appreciate that.Again, I think that the few quirks of my experience mean I might have considered this chair, an overall, 4.75 rather than outright 5, though there\u2019s a lot of things that the chair and the company behind it are doing well, so I\u2019m rounding up. I think that it\u2019s numerous adjustments and features would make it suitable for many people and I will continue to happily use it throughout its lifespan!",

All the screws, washers, etc. were clearly identified. They even included extra pieces. A pleasant surprise. Other companies don't. I really loved the \"T\" shaped Allen Wrench. So easy to use. Easy on the hand and wrist. Made assembly easier. Assembled chair is very sturdy. Easy to roll and swivel. Cushioned seat and armrests are great. I have back issues, so the high back, lumbar support, and adjustable headrest were just what I needed. I can sit at my desk in comfort. This chair is of high quality and a good buy.",

                "reviewText": "The instructions were great, the parts were easy to put together and seem of good quality and sturdiness. However, the packaging for the screws and Allen wrench was not the best, I would have preferred they be put in individual packaging but I just had to take a picture of the labeled packaging before I opened it and it was easy to keep track of all pieces. I chose this chair over others because of it's price, the discount I got, the overall style of the chair and the weight limit. I am about 300lbs so I needed something with that weight limit. The chair has a pretty big seat and the arm rest don't constrict my torso or thighs. I am even able to sit with one leg under me. The seat cushion could be better, it's a bit hard and not soft or bouncy, more of a sturdy leather. It took me about 20-30 minutes to put it all together, all the screws and the Allen wrench were included. I was worried about the piston part, the mechanism that allows the chair to go up and down but surprisingly that was the easiest part of the assembly. The headrest is a little weird, it feels comfortable when I'm able to rest my head on it but I can only do so if I'm leaning back and have my head back but it's really adjustable so that's good. So far so good.Pardon my messy room.I'm currently tly activating my 5 year warranty that was included in the purchase, I almost purchased the 40 2 year warranty that Amazon offered me but I saw that this 5 year warranty was included in my purchase.",
