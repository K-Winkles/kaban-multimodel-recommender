                "reviewText": "The initial price draws you in but the overall quality is a bit subpar. I purchased 6 of these for my customer waiting room and they are holding up for now, but time will tell. Several of the chairs had problems with the bolts lining up or were difficult to get the bolts started due to the nut side not being square and properly aligned. After assembly we noticed 2 of the 6 chairs were lop sided/leaning and had to be twisted a bit to get them to sit straight up. These chairs are not for large people as they are very narrow. The overall comfort for those who fit in them isn't bad and the material finish on the chairs seem to be good. Other than looking very small compared to our prior chairs these chairs seem to be doing the job for a fraction of the cost of other chairs.",
