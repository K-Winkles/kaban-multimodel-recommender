                "reviewText": "I was leaving my apartment for about a week and a half, and since I was doing a lot of traveling, I had to leave my cat at home. Since I knew he would be angry at me, I wanted to get something to protect my furniture from his claws as well as anything that might... find its way out of the litter box. I have two chairs that I needed covered--one average sized single-sitter as well as a papasan chair.In one package you get two bags. The bags are sealed on three edges and they're open on one edge. I was able to slip the full in-tact cover onto my average sized sofa-chair--however, it only fit over the top and sides. It didn't completely engulf the chair. (This was fine for me since I wasn't moving, but if you're looking to use these to protect your furniture while moving, it might not be the best buy for you).On the papasan, however, I had to cut open two of the sides (it essentially just made one large flat sheet of plastic) so that I could lay it on top of the cushion. It worked well for my purposes, but again I wasn't moving.As for the quality of the plastic: It did its job pretty well. It's sufficiently water-proof, and there weren't any rips or imperfections when I got the product. However, the plastic is a lot thinner than I expected. My cat could have easily ripped through the plastic with his teeth/claws. In fact, if I wanted, I could probably have pulled the plastic apart with my bare hands with a little effort and pressure.So, all in all: Good quality and cheap for temporarily protecting furniture/floors. Probably not a good choice for protecting furniture while moving, as it will probably rip and/or won't be big enough to fit some pieces.",
