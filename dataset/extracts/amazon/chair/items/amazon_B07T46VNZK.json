The bolts also had blue loktite on threads so should stay tight. The chairs are compact size and fit the tight space in breakfast area perfectly. Buyer should be aware of the size of chair which is on the website before purchase. Finish was not to shiny but closer to a mat black. Finish had only minor flaws of no real visual problem. Only minor compalint concerned the rubber like leg bottom protectors. The center of protector had a hard plastic like round protrusion in the center almost flush with rubber. This might scratch some floor finishes. I added stick on 1 \" diameter non slip pads that should cure that potential problem. Cannot speak to longevity of chairs but expect should hold up well. Appear sturdy enough and suitable for indoor or occasional dry outside use",

They are small and light weight, and are comfortable, especially with the cushions we also ordered from Amazon. The chairs are power-coated steel but our porch is covered and we will not leave them outside in the winter so they should hold up fine. Considering how inexpensive these were, we are very pleased with them.We ordered 4 chairs, They arrived very nicely packaged in one box. Instructions and the necessary hardware were included. One of the corners of the box was pretty badly crushed so the driver had me check the chairs. They were completely undamaged. A testament to good packing. Assembly was straight forward. Just be sure to not tighten the bolts until you have all of them started.",

You can\u2019t even find chairs that inexpensive at IKEA for pete's sake! These are well made; constructed from solid steel that feels sturdy and strong, yet is surprisingly light too making them easy to lift for stacking . They were delivered SO quickly! I ordered them on Sep. 22 and they were delivered to my door midday on Sep. 24. They came carefully packaged, arriving in pristine condition, and were very easy to assemble. It took just four screws to attach each back to the seat (the screws & Allen keys are all included). In no more than 30 minutes the chairs went from a few parts in a box, to fully assembled and tucked up to my dining table. I love them! They are exactly what I wanted in terms of style and quality, and the super afforable price was a definite bonus! I could not be more pleased with my purchase and I absolutely would not hesitate to recommend/order from this company again.",
