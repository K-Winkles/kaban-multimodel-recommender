Considering the price I paid for this compared to much more expensive chairs I have purchased, it is surprisingly well constructed, very sturdy and very comfortable to sit in. It was the perfect complement to my daughter's desk. She absolutely loves it. It was very easy to assemble and the instructions were very clear. I love the fact that you can put the armrest in either the up or down position and you can adjust the tilting angles. A very versatile chair.",

                "reviewText": "I didn't realize how bad I needed a new chair! The chair parts came neatly and well packaged. I used the video thru the QR code to put it together. It does have spare screws. It took me about 40-45 mins. Could have been less but I was doing other stuff in between and I took my time to make sure I did it correctly. Wasn't hard at all. The seat is thick and firm, which I like. The thickest part is about 4 inches. My old chair was flat as a pancake! So this is comfy! The wheels move around smoothly, and it goes up and down with no issues. The arm rests are great. They have some cushion and I love that they raise up. I work 4 10hr days, so we'll see how it holds up. It's a great looking, sturdy, and comfy chair for the price.",

The instructions were really clear and I had someone check it for me when I was finished. I had done a great job of tightening every bolt! After 35 years of office work and trying many different chairs, I'm pleased to say that this chair is very comfortable and sturdy. I know that my back won't be aching after a couple of hours of sewing. I also love that the arms flip up so it can fit under my sewing table. I showed it to my granddaughter who also loves it and is ordering one this week! \ud83d\ude0a",

It is like a dense mesh that looks and feels good - seems like higher quality than regular fabric. I also like that the arms fold up so you can push the chair under a keyboard tray. Ergonomic are good so far. The Lumbar support is ok and is adjustable, but not sure if it helps or is necessary. I might prefer just plain mesh on the back without the lumbar support... but otherwise it's a comfortable chair with decent adjustments. Also very easy to assemble. Recommended especially on sale.",
