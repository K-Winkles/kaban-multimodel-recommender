                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Fit For the Secret Lab Titan Chair!",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Review Fit for Secret Lab TITAN ChairOVERALL IMPRESSION:An excellent budget friendly cover choice for any gaming or office chair that it fits which I can happily say does an excellent job on the Titan Chair by Secret Labs.I have back issues so I bought this chair and was extremely satisfied with its support.But unfortunately this particular titan chair comes with a synthetic leather which although is stated as being pretty durable, I know in time, No matter how durable the synthetic leather is, it will deteriorate.Especially when your raw skin and oil\u2019s continually touch it.So sitting in it With a tank top and/or shorts or with no shirt\u2026 doesn\u2019t necessarily feel good because your skin will stick to it and you know that you\u2019re also helping that synthetic leather deteriorate faster.So , a cover is necessary at times.This is why I chose this cover, And I\u2019m happy that I did so because although it covered the beautiful decor of the Titan chair, it still looks pretty good.This cover is a \u201cuniversal fit\u201d type of product which was designed to fit a multitude of different office and gaming chairs.So, I was quite shocked to see how well it fit on the Titan Chair.Another concern I had was that I didn\u2019t want a cover that was too thick or something that might restrict the comfort that the chair offers out of the box.I wanted a cover but I still wanted to feel the quality of the chair that I purchased.With this cover on I can enjoy the chair and it\u2019s support without any added discomfort or muted chair experience.Package:It comes in a simple clear plastic bag with 4 parts1 Back Seat cover1 Bottom Cushion cover2 arm rest covers.Material:The item description claims it to be a spandex, elastic stretch and I would agree to that.If you ever had a pair of swim shorts that had the integrated silky like nylon underwear ( not the fish net webbing type) then You\u2019ll get a good idea of what this material is like.It does stretch well and seems toBe of a decent quality.To the touch it feels smooth yet soft. Not silky not not cottony either. Somewhere in the middleApplication:It says it\u2019s easy to install but there is a wrong and right way to do it.With no Manual or instructions you might have a trial and error period.It didn\u2019t take me long but the first time I tried to put it on I noticed that the backseat portion should only be put on in one particular way.It doesn\u2019t fit right if you put it on in the opposite direction of the way I describe below.Installing Back seat cover:To start make sure that the zipper tab is facing on the front side of the back seat which should be facing you if your in front of the chair.You\u2019re going to slide it over the headrest and back seat until the zipper touches the bottom seat cushion.Then you push that zipper in between and through where the back seat and bottom cushion meet.CAUTIONWhen you slide the zipper through, Make sure that you guard the bottom cushion and back seat areas with your fingers so as to not scratch the material of YOUR seat with the zipper.It\u2019s not a hassle or anything but it\u2019s something you should be aware of because the backseat and the bottom cushion sit pretty close together.If done correctly when you look at the back of the chair, your zipper should start on the left side of the back of the seat and zip all the way to the right. See photos and videoInstalling bottom cushion cover:This was pretty easy to understand the direction in the way that you apply the cover. The only concern is how the elastic straps in plastic buckles attach around the levers and joints of the chair.I provided photos and a video of this area.The first part is easy. Just slide over the cover until you reach the back part of the cushion.Then slide the elastic strap with the \u201cfemale\u201d part of the plastic buckles in between the seat cushionsYou\u2019ll then extend the \u201cmale\u201d part of the plastic buckle on the side of the cushion to meet the \u201cfemale\u201d part which will wrap around the \u201cjoints\u201d of the chair to secure to the \u201cmale\u201d buckle partSee photos/videoArmrest covers are just simple wrap around affair.Fit And Appearance:It fits just about as perfectly as you would like a cover to fit your chair.Although, It makes your very sexy and elegant Titan chair look quite generic.Yet, it is a nice smooth finish and has a nice feel to it.Near the \u201cshoulders\u201d of the chair there is a very tiny bit of \u201cbunching\u201d.It also covers The lumbar adjustment knob so you may either want to set it the way you like before applying the cover or you can do like I do and just turn it slowly a portion at a time while the cover is still On.The cover is thin and will allow that knob to turn but I just wouldn\u2019t turn it too fast and too much at a time.It also does tend to \u201cWeb\u201d just a bit in the middle of the back rest (which is not noticeable to the eye) but once you sit on, it will stretch to conform to your back and meet the chair.The armrest covers fits so nicely they look like they belong there.It is a shame to have to cover my titan chair but if I want to protect it I have this option and if I wanted to show his true colors than I can always remove it.It\u2019s not that big of a deal to take it off and on.Generally speaking the chair still looks really nice with this cover on it. You can see for yourself in the photos/videoConcerns:My only concerns at this moment is it\u2019s longevity and durability.I\u2019ve only had this for a couple of days and it is a thin material. It seems decently made but I am concerned that overtime maybe some of the seams will start to come apart or that zipper.Also the elastic straps that connect to the plastic buckles could be an area of concern. But at this point it is mute issue.Only time will tell and I will have to update my review if and when this cover fails me.After carefully reviewing the seams ans zipper, My guess is that everything will hold up well and be fine.It should be noted that this is very cheap alternative to anything else that you could use to protect your chair.So even if it were to fall apart in a year or so it\u2019s not that much to replace it and I can\u2019t really expect it to last forever.With that said it seems to be pretty good in this department.There are some things I would like to address about the item description on the Amazon page.The Amazon item DESCRIPTION says.\u2014-Anti-slip,Dustproof, Anti-dirty,Anti-scratch,Washable,Removable,Durable to use\u2014-Anti-slip? I don\u2019t think so.It does stay in place but you can slide around a bit when moving on it because it\u2019s a little slick. I think it also slips a little bit between the chair and the cover.You won\u2019t slide when not moving though.I have reclined in the chair with it on and it\u2019s not like I\u2019m sliding down or around. It\u2019s only through shifting I sometimes notice a bit of sliding.But it\u2019s not that big of a deal as I said there\u2019s elastic straps and it\u2019s stretchy so it does retain its shape.It\u2019s just not something I would call \u201canti-slip\u201d.Dust proof, anti Dirty? Yeeeeaaah NO!I was actually doing something that got my hands a little dusty and when I touched my chair it went right onto the fabric.I didn\u2019t even know my hands were that dirty until I saw that I made a handprint on the cover LOLI don\u2019t know what makes them think it\u2019s dust proof. Maybe they\u2019re trying to say that it will keep your chair dust proof which is obvious.Anti Scratch? Again noThis material is thin and if anything sharp comes up against it, it will scratch, tear or rip.I don\u2019t even think it\u2019ll protect your seat very much from anything that can scratch it.But it\u2019s better than leaving it naked.I can also see this material \u201cpilling\u201d over time but I can\u2019t be sure at this time.Durable? Questionable.We will see in time.Pros:* Inexpensive* Nice material that looks great and fits great* Thin enough experience your chair as it was meant to be* Easy to take off and on, washableCons:(More like concerns)* Durability/Longevity in question* You MAY slide a bit while shifting positions* Covers the Lumbar Adjustment Knob* Thinness maybe be a problem for someBottom line:This cover is easy to put on and off (when you understand the right method) Fits well, looks great, feels good, and offers just enough protection while allowing the chair to still function and feel the way it should.At this price anybody I recommend anyone with a Titan chair (or any chair that fits) to have one on hand. I hope this helps.",
