There are some plastic parts (wheels, arm handles) that you might not find on a more expensive chair, but the padding, the gas lift and the leather are all very nice. The chair is firm and comfortable for sitting and looks well made (does not look cheap), it rolls very well, has cushioning on the arms that will prevent dings in the drawer front and with the arms up, it rolls nicely all the way under the desk.",

                "reviewText": "I researched and read a lot of reviews before making this choice - without spending hundreds of dollars for a chair. This is great chair for the money - its very supportive, sturdy, moves smoothly and I love that the arms lift up so it can fit under my home office desk. I needed more support than the chair I had - paid for a cheap $60 chair but found this was a mistake - and this one is wonderful. I'm not a small gal, by any stretch and I feel well supported, I fit comfortably in the seat without being squeezed in and i love how the lumbar that makes this chair even more comfortable. I know there's a lot of chairs at a much higher price point, that may be even better - but I really feel I lucked out on this one and that it feels and looks more expensive then it is. Now - my bf put it together for me - and there's a bit of confusion at first on direction or 2 (as its only pics) but otherwise, he had it together within 15-20 min. Very happy !",

                "reviewText": "We bought this chair to replace a 30+ yo uncomfortable desk chair. We needed a chair to fit into a 27\" wide knee hole and the flip-up armrests was the way to go! This chair is comfortable and has good lumbar support. The armrests are wide and seem longer than others out there. The tilt-back/rocking feature is nice--just refer to the \"Yeti\" video. We chose the brown color and was very pleased to find that it was a shaded brown with a nice grain, which looks more expensive. The stitching is dark brown to match so it will not show dirt over time. The style of this chair is classy and I preferred the black legs and armrest supports-- without all the glitzy metal parts that get scratched and dulled over time.The only issue we had was the end of the armrest had a concave dimple where stuffing was missing. Someone else also had the same issue and the manufacturer needs to have better quality control. I had to unscrew the armrest to remove it; take out 9 staples; peel back the armrest cover and stuff it with fiber fill so it matched the other armrest and re-staple the cover. This is the reason I gave it 4-stars overall.The assembly was very easy other than re-stuffing the armrest. I felt that this chair was reasonably priced and hope it holds up well for many years.",

                "reviewText": "As a gamer and IT professional, I know how important it is to have a high-quality executive office chair. Over the years, I have assembled countless chairs at work, and now it's time to replace the home chair that I've had for 20 years. After trying out various brands, I can say that this chair's precision build is impressive compared to other more expensive chairs.The parts fit together seamlessly without any warping, and there's no need for excessive force or special adjustments. As someone who spends long hours at a desk, I appreciate the well-padded seat and backrest, adjustable armrests, and height adjustability that this chair offers. The frame is also sturdy and durable, and the casters glide smoothly across the floor.Overall, I highly recommend this executive office chair for anyone looking for a comfortable and durable option, whether you're a gamer or an IT professional. Its precision build sets it apart from other chairs on the market, and it's an excellent value for the price.",

                "reviewText": "This chair is very comfy. The chair I had before was pretty but hurt my backend after sitting for a short time. This one has a soft bottom so very comfortable there. I also have a foot rest to elevate my feet a few inches, but even without it, I am not feeling circulation cutting off at the back of my legs.I tend to sit more at a 90 degree angle when working at the computer, so the back support is lacking a bit for me, but sitting back is very comfortable. I could see myself even dozing off if I sat back and just rested!The chair has a pretty strong odor, but hoping that will fade - it is pretty nauseating after sitting here for an hour. This is day one of use.Chair looks great. Very pretty/clean/elegant looking (I have in cream/ivory color). The arms go up so I can slide it under my desk when finished. Arms are comfortably positioned and soft/cushioned for when I sit back from my desk.I'm 5'2 and this chair works great for my height.",

There was clearly another shipping label that had been applied to the box that had been ripped off. So when I opened the box, I was not surprised to see that it definitely looked as though someone tried to put this thing together and for whatever reason sent it back.Mostly everything was loose in the box, with cardboard smashed and clearly did not look like it was factory packed. I could see the side of the chair where the screws/bolts go, and they certainly appeared to have attempts made to fasten the chair together.I am immediately returning this. SO DON'T BUY IT - YOU MAY RECEIVE THIS ONE AS BEING NEW!",
