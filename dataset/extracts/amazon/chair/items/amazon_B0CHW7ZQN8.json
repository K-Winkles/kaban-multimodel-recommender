Spacious and long enough to be pulled out and let our boy nap on it, now that he has out grown his docatote, this is perfect for this stage of his nap journey. Good quality material and glows in the dark enough to see where it is at night but not over powering to distract. Would definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s a great toddler chair. Large and sturdy enough to hold 2 toddlers while holding its shape. It didn\u2019t take too long to expand and only needed minimal adjustment to get the cushions in the right place. The glow in the dark designs is a cute plus. We bought it for our daughter but both kids love sitting and laying in it. I would definitely buy from them again.",

I wish it was a little more sturdy as the sides bend easily but overall a good product. Design is cute and fabric is soft and machine washable which is a plus.",

Its very comfortable and soft; my toddler and I can comfortably snuggle on it together, the cover comes off easily for washing...even my dogs want to lay on it. It's a win win win in our home:)",
