The assembly was a bit difficult, mainly because for screwing in some of screws, it took a good amount of strength, and putting the back on was difficult for just me as I had to hold the back in place while trying to insert the screws. So, you may need a second person for that, but the chair is unbelievable comfortable and stylish",

The faux leather material is supple, and the underneath padding is just right. The stitching and seams are perfectly aligned. The chair profile is low and it fits comfortably in small spaces, although the chair is standard size. My wife is 5'1\" and I am 5'11\". The height adjustment operates smoothly and easily and permits either of us to adjust the seat height to a comfortable level. For the money, you can't go wrong with this beautiful chair. I recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "Honestly I've had this chair for my home office for only about 10 days, so I can't attest to its durability. However, I purchased this chair for $64.99 and so far it's been great, super comfortable and very affordable relative to the other office chairs I reviewed. I spend 4 - 6 hours daily in this chair and the back pain is gone! The chair's arms are adjustable and so far I just love this purchase, particularly after reading some of the reviews for the other available office chairs, i.e. cheaply made, falling apart, defective, no return, etc. If you are dissatisfied with this chair you can also return it in the first 30 days, unlike so many others!",

Otherwise I figured how to do the rest except for lining up the pre- drilled holes for the back and seat. I am 85 so I am not super strong!. The chair is very comfortable and quite attractive.",
