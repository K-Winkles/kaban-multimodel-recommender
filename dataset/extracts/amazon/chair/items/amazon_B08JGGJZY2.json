                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars A Solid Support Chair (Pun Intended) that is Obnoxious to Assemble",
                "reviewText": "The chair isn\u2019t quite the greatest thing since sliced bread (as the reviews make it out to be), but then, it\u2019s not an awful chair. While it passes the eye candy test, the illustrated instructions may as well have been in Chinese, assembly definitely does not take 20 minutes (more like 1.5 hours after swapping pieces around over and over to figure out how the chair was supposed to be put together), and the chair is not nearly as cushy as one would hope for. That said, it is decently comfortable and has some cool features.The number one thing going for it is that it actually does provide excellent lower back support, and the massage function is a little gaudy and isn\u2019t a trip to a spa house with a massage , but then it\u2019s a nice little bonus. This is good for the lower back and it will make your chiropractor proud and your pain receptors quiet.Of course, with that lower back support, it feels a bit unusual, especially if one has not used a chair of this type before, as it feels as though there\u2019s something sticking out and into your lower back. And as plush as the chair appears in the picture, it doesn\u2019t quite translate into the soft squishy feeling that allows your lazy bum to rest. The faux leather is not really the most comfortable material, and is rather firm instead of malleable, though rest assured that you will not be sitting on aluminum or concrete. You will feel somewhat comfortable, maybe even fairly comfortable.A couple of additional features that are pretty neat are the gas pump that adjusts the height, and the ability for the chair to tilt back. In the reclined position, the chair most definitely multiplies its comfort level, and will be good for someone who wants to lean back when they\u2019re reading, but seeks to avoid a situation where lying down on the couch would put you to sleep. Though the wheels on the chair were not at all as mobile as I had hoped, making it somewhat difficult to move the chair across my laminate floor.Now for the bad news. The illustrations have no words, the parts are not labeled (though they have code letters in the illustrated instructions), and they occasionally do not make any sense. For example, the left and right handles can easily be attached incorrectly because the instructions do not distinguish which side of the handle should be attached to the base. The wheels that attach to the bottom do not easily snap in, so it can fool you into wondering if there are other parts that should be holding the wheels into place. I tried pounding the wheel into the leg with a hammer and it still failed to go in, but eventually got them connected with the assistance of the strength in my biceps. Then, attaching the back part of the seat is a nightmare. The instructions have you squeeze it in between the handles, partially screw in the screws, then rotate the chair upwards to screw in the remaining screws, then finishing the project by tightening all the screws. The problem is that if you\u2019re unlucky, the screws will fall out, the back part of the chair will fall, and then you might have to start all over again. Breaking one of these screws is probably a real possibility, though fortunately they seem tough, and the package comes with spares.If you\u2019re a mechanical engineer or maybe even a carpenter, then assembling this thing will probably not be that hard. But then not everyone is an engineer or a carpenter. That being said, the final product is effective, and the value for what you get is acceptable, though it may come with an additional price in the form of putting the darn thing together.",

                "reviewText": "I am very impressed by the quality and comfort of this chair. I am so happy to finally receive a high-quality product from Amazon that actually looks and feels as high-quality as advertised. The chair is supportive, with great lumbar support, armrests, and an easy to use height adjusting feature. The only thing I don't like about this chair is how absolutely INFURIATING the assembly was. The screws meant to attach the upper part of the chair to the armrests are all just a hair inch shorter than they should be for no logical reason, meaning you have to precisely, loosely put each screw in the absolutely perfect position while the chair part is also held in the perfect position if you want to be able to actually screw the screws in. My boyfriend ended up using longer screws from a different tool set that worked so much better and stopped our screaming and cursing. I truly do not know why they could not have just made those screws slightly longer. Also, the reclining feature is basically just a rocking chair feature.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE 11/21/23***REFUSAL TO HONOR WARRANTY***I immediately contacted FDW Store (selling this chair on Amazon) re: manufacturer defect in this new chair (see photos and original review below).Natalie @ FDW Store (Factory Direct Warehouse, LLC) refused my warranty claim, instead saying it was Amazon's responsibility.Amazon has no responsibility for a manufacturers poor quality, product defect, or Warranty.The printed Warranty Form (see photo) enclosed with the instructions for the assembly of this chair plainly explain the 90 day warranty on the chair re: upholstery;'Factory Direct Wholesale products are warranted against manufacturing defects in material and workmanship'. Interesting......Nothing in the Warranty says it's Amazon's responsibility.This chair was made, boxed and shipped with the defective armrest from Factory Direct Warehouse , LLC/The FDW Store, who SHOULD HONOR the Warranty.CUSTOMER BEWARE. DO NOT BUY FROM FDW STORE OR FACTORY DIRECT WAREHOUSE. Chair shipped with an wrinkle upholstery defect in Right armrest. (See attached photo) It's supposed to be smooth. The left armrest was done correctly. No idea why the manufacturer would consider this OK to ship to a customer.Seat back on this chair was nearly impossible to attach to the chair armrests. The holes for the Allen screws did not line up like they should. It took two of us to forcefully position the chair back into position where the Allen screws could attach the armrests to the chairback.Construction of the chair and upholstery quality is OK, not great. Not sure how long the upholstery will last with daily use.I have emailed the manufacturer for a replacement of the defective armrest. Hopefully they will correct the issue.",
