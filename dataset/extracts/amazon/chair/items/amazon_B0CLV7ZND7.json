I have not had a gaming chair in a while since I had to get rid of my old one when I was moving.I love the red and black of this chair and I like that it has bucket seats. It is so comfy.It came with everything that I needed to put this chair together. Everything was nicely packed and labeled so that you would know exactly what screw to use in what area of the chair. It only took me about 30 minutes to assemble and it is very comfy and the wheels are sooooo smooth!!!I like that fact that the armrests move up and down. For me, this makes it easier for me to get in and out of the chair.I am sitting in the chair as I type this and I can tell you that it is very comfy.It is not the most expensive chair nor the most comfortable chair out there BUT for the price, it is great. I love it and I am looking forward to sitting in this chair the next time I play my games. =)",

                "reviewText": "This is a really interesting chair that really delivers and was much better than I was expecting. The prospect of getting a chair via mail is a bit daunting but this package delivers completely. The real surprise to me here is just how good the instructions and tools are for putting this together. It comes in a nicely packed box and the parts are easy to prepare. It actually comes with the T Driver which I have never seen in any furniture before but which makes assembly go faster and easier. In general it has:- Nice pleather like material and very comfortable to sit in- Great rolling and easy up and down function- Arm rests slide up when neededIts a firm seat which is nice and doesn't get hot. It doesn't have a ton of adjustments although there is a dial underneath the seat to control back and forth motion. Overall its a great chair and I am very pleased with it. I would definitely recommend it.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Decent value gaming chair",
                "reviewText": "Let's get something out of the way at the very beginning here: this is NOT a high-end gaming chair. That being said, at it's current price, it is a very decent value gaming chair. Each individual piece game wrapped quite well so as to not shift around in the box or cause damage to other pieces within the box. The base with the legs is actually a decent quality metal frame, which I did not expect at this price point, and which I was pleasantly surprised by. The leather is PLU leather, so don't expect top grain performance here. The seat of the chair is actually less contoured than I would have liked and is a little less comfortable because of it. This would work well for short sessions in the chair, but I would not like to sit in it all day long -- it's just not comfortable enough. The arms fold back and the seat raises and tilts, though the tilting action needs to be adjusted underneath the seat instead of on the side, but that's usually reserved for higher-end chairs anyway. I'm just happy that it has the ability to tilt. It rolls smoothly and has a decent quality feel to it overall. Putting it together took a little bit of time and wasn't too bad, but putting the back of the chair on was a little tough. Make sure you follow the instructions exactly and when it says to only put the screws in 50% of the way, there's a reason for it, and you will tighten them up later once the back of the chair is in place. Overall, I would say I wouldn't use this for my daily driver for working 8+ hours each day, but for short sessions in front of a screen, it's pretty decent for the price.",
