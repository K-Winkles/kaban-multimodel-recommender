                "reviewText": "Love it. I'm not good at asymbeling and this was super easy. Just do one step At a time and read the notes per step. Last gamer chair I had was a titan secret lab and this was as comfy as that. The armbars don't move but that wasn't a problem for me.the footrest is just a easy sliding bar that doesn't really extend to far but still worked for me. The headrest is OK but is not luxury comfort. Having said all that for the money and ease of setup it's a great deal for under $200. The chair is really comfortable the recliner steadily stops at several recline positions. If you knew what you were doing 100 percent you could set this chair up I'm 10 minutes but with reading it's probably a 40 minute setup. When you connect the top to the bottom there is a slot at the bottom the top fits in so you can easily screw the screws in with one person. No extra tools required or needed. While it's not premium luxury it is a really really comfortable chair and even has a massager that uses USB. Its not super strong but it does a good job. Only complaint it's a little loud but not deafening. If your looking to spend under 200 and need a one person setup I highly recommend this chair! Delivery was also fast! It's a little intimidating when first opening but the directions were fairly easy to follow. Had a few extra screws in the end but I think they are just backups. Just buy it lol.",

                "reviewText": "I got this chair on sale for $110 (not counting shipping) which I recommend you do.Assembly: It took barely an hour to put together and could\u2019ve honestly been quicker than that had I not been multitasking. It\u2019s incredibly easy/simple to assemble, a child (of good enough strength to tighten the screws and lift the chair) could build this. Despite it\u2019s simplistic construction is feels smooth and sturdy.Experience: initially, it felt cheap. The sides of the backing of the chair feel as though they are lined with pool noodles, which threw me off at first. I was worried the chair was going to be stiff or uncomfortable. However, I was pleasantly surprised! It\u2019s very comfortable to sit in, and the telescoping arms and foot rest are incredibly appreciated. I will say the plastic of the arms feels on the cheaper side and they already seemed a little wobbly shortly after construction. This can likely be amended by tightening the screws. The lumbar support pillow sits a little low for me, so I wish it adjusted to an even higher point, but I will say I am rather curvy so that\u2019s likely a me problem. The headrest pillow is very nice and the backrest reclines and locks well, doesn\u2019t feel wobbly or like it\u2019s going to tip backwards. The chair also sits very low which was wonderful since it fit under my bunk bed, *and* fit my legs comfortably under my desk, which is impressive since most others do not (I have thicker thighs).Summary: I think this chair is definitely one of the best on the market for the price point. It\u2019s not exactly top of the market quality but that\u2019s to be expected for only $110. I would expect slightly better quality if I were paying the full $200 for it, though. Recommended on sale, and especially for those on more of a budget. Exceeded expectation. 8/10",

                "reviewText": "I'm obsessed with this chair. I was struggling in an old classic black pleather Walmart special before with 2 seat cushions under my rear and a blanket over the back for support. This chair cradles me so well. The lumbar pillow is easily adjusted to where you need it based on what angle or position you desire to sit at. The neck cushion is similarly adjustable, though not as extensively as the lumbar one. The material is soft yet feels sturdy, I got the all light grey one and even with 2 dogs, and \"house sweatpants\" with dog hair, it remains clean. Hair brushes off easily and a Tide pen is perfect for spot cleaning.The adjustable foot rest is incredible. I can sit with my legs crossed or extended. I'm 5'4\" and this seat lowers to the point where I can sit flat footed and in perfect posture. I also have a floor cushion for my own sake because I have a nerve condition. I typically spend HOURS at a time in this chair and I don't have the extreme pain and discomfort one would expect from a typical desk chair. The arm rests are cushioned so well, so propping your forearms or elbows on them is plush and comfortable.Asswmbly was swift and simple, with thorough directions and tools provided. Everything about this chair feels smooth and sturdy. The only thing I haven't tried is the massager in the lumbar cushion, so look to other reviews for that :)",
