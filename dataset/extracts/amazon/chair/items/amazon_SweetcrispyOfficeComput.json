It holds my big butt with no problem, tucks under the desk out of the way and is comfortable for extended periods of use. I was pleasantly surprised by the beefiness of the frame pieces and it was super easy for this 61yo to put together.",

Within hours of placing the order, a friend indicated they had two of these chairs and I was welcome to one. Can't beat free! The chair seats wonderfully, it is firm but not uncomfortable. The coasters are good, not at all difficult to maneuver around in. The chair my friend gave me was still in the box. The assembly was super easy and not at all time consuming. It is the perfect size for my small office area.",
