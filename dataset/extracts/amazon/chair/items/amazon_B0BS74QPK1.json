                "reviewText": "I have been thoroughly impressed with the performance and comfort of this chair.The adjustable height feature allowed me to set the chair to the perfect level for my desk, ensuring that I maintain proper posture throughout the day. The movable armrests are a fantastic addition, as they provide excellent support for my forearms, reducing strain on my shoulders and neck. The armrests also pivot up and out of the way, so my cats are less prone to jumping on/off of the armrests, scratching them.The chair's durability is also remarkable. The steel frame feels sturdy and robust, and the high-quality upholstery shows no signs of wear or tear, even after several months of daily use. It's clear that this chair is built to last.But what truly sets this chair apart is its comfort. The cushioning on both the seat and backrest is plush and supportive, making long hours at my desk a breeze. The breathable mesh back keeps me cool, even during the hottest days, and I no longer find myself constantly readjusting my seating position. And the lumbar support is not too intrusive but does a great job in keeping my back aligned.Assembly was a breeze as well, thanks to the clear instructions and included tools. Overall, this chair is a good value and I would purchase again!",

                "reviewText": "I just started a new position that required me to work from home. I took a long time looking at different chairs. I needed something I could sit in all day without back pain and something that could also lean back in because I discovered I really needed that too. I finally landed on this one, it was a good compromise on cost and quality. I was not disappointed. It feels like it costs more than it did. I had no issues assembling it and appreciated the extra hardware just in case the plant missed something. It's been comfortable to sit in and I didn't realize how much I would appreciate the fact that the armrests can come up. I have a small space and my back is to a wall, so to make the space feel bigger I like that I can flip up the armrests and put it completely under my desk. The wheels struggle to move on my carpet which is thick and heavily padded - I swear the previous owners wanted to sleep on the floor, it's absurdly padded. I ended up buying replacement wheels to see if that would help but it made no difference. So I would say the wheels are just fine! Even with the fancy \"rollerblade\" wheels it moved the same. I would definitely buy this one again!",

Assembly was easy and fairly quick (instructions were sparse but still clear and understandable; no pieces/parts were missing). The chair looks great. The comfort and functionality- pretty darn good and reliable (and that's after owning for a few weeks, with almost daily use sitting for a few hours straight). However, I will say, I don't expect the chair's longevity against consistent wear and use to be extraordinarily great - we'll see. Obviously, you can't expect the same quality and comfort is you would if spending $500-$1200 for a genuine Herman Miller Aeron Chair. And I don't think this chair is misleading and trying to advertise itself as exactly comparable to a Aeron. Thus, I still give this chair 5 stars because what you DO get is well-matched against what you pay - it's a decent quality product at a nice value.",

My wife complains that she has back pain after using our old Costco chair, and now I came across this chair and thought we should give it a try. We like the chair materials which are good quality. The breathable back is a great touch. My back usually starts sweating when I spend an hour in a chair but no more. I spent more than 2 hours to watch John Wick 3 (movie) yesterday and this chair is roomy and comfortable. by the way I am 5 ft 8 tall. Assembly is pretty easy, took me about 30 mins. The parts are well labelled so putting them together was not difficult at all, it provides all the tools I needed to assemble the chair. We like the black colour because we think it is easier to clean and maintain. Another feature we really like is that we can flip the arm rest up 90 degrees, because our desk is quite low , this feature is perfect because we could still push the chair against our desk when we do not use it and it saves space!",

The chair arrived next day after I ordered it, instruction to assemble the chair is easy and it even gives you a link which shows a video of how to put together the chair. The cushion of the chair is comfortable, flip up arm rest gives me the ability to get out of the chair on the side and leave it down when I want to lean back and rest my arm. The most thing I love about this chair is the adjustable lumber support, which I can adjust to my desire position to support my lower back. The wheel of the chair is very smooth, it's so smooth that my kids took it for a spin around the whole house. Would definitely recommend anyone who needs a quality build office chair.",
