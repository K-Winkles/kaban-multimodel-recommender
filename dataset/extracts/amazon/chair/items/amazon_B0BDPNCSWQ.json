                "reviewText": "Animal prints and bean bag chairs have been around for a long time. And when you combine the two, you get a chic look that is comfortable as well.The somewhat muted colors in the snow leopard print compliment my livingroom decor, and it provides extra seating in my small apartment.I like that it is structured with a back and arms. The feel of the faux fur is like a rabbit jacket that I had years ago but without the shedding. If you need to add extra filling there are 2 zippers on the bottom, one on top of each other. They don't have zipper pulls. This is a safety feature, and it also prevents the beans from spilling out as soon as you open it.I used a safety pin through the hole where the zipper pull would be. Unfortunately, the cover is not removable. So it has to be spot cleaned.It has a handle of the same fabric for easy portability.When I tried it out, it fit me perfectly and I found myself falling asleep. I didn't think I would be sitting in it so much. But it is great to watch TV, read a book, use an iPad ot just daydreaming while enjoying a cup of coffee.Even though this bean bag chair is an ideal space and size for my body (I'm 5' 2\" and weigh 95 lbs), it might be difficult to get up and down in it if you have long legs or problems with your knees or legs. It sits close to the ground.It would make a great gift for small grandkids and teenagers. Even though I am way past that age, I thoroughly enjoy the comfort and relaxation it gives me.Side note: I did buy extra filling when I need to plump up the shape.",

                "reviewText": "I bought two of these chairs in white, here's the good, the bad and the ugly:Cons:1) REALLY not filled enough. I had to buy more filler within a week of use and it's only my 7 and 3 year old daughters (weight 50 lbs and 30 lbs) each sitting in their own chairs, not grownups or heavy people.2) Smelled a bit chemical when came out of the box but I left it outside on our screened-in deck and the smell lessened substantially (not completely) within 24 hours. It no longer smells bad.4) Refill material cost me $37 to plump up my brand new chairs ):3) No way to wash the cover. I would have liked if it could be removed to be washed occasionally.Pros:1) I solved the saggy, not-filled-enough problem by purchasing 10 lbs shredded memory foam for filling bean chairs (from a company on amazon) it worked WAY better than the beans. The foam perfectly filled my two Milano bean chairs, one 5lb bag in one, the other 5 lb bag in the other. Now the chairs are totally full, much better supported, and will hopefully remain so for a long time before I need to refill again.2) My kids LOVE the chairs. Love them. They are like giant fluffy bird nests and my daughters like to sit in them every day to look at books or relax. In fact, the reason I bought two was because I got one for our younger daughter but our older daughter loved it so much, I knew we needed a second one and ordered it that day.3) They look nice in our livingroom. They are for the kids but they look nice and add a cozy touch to the room, they make a cozy livingroom nook which is very inviting for the kids.4) The castle cut-out box playhouse was a nice touch. Unfortunately, the first chair's box was beat up and we didn't use it but the second chair's box was perfect and we did cut it out (it's actually perforated cardboard so it's easy to do) and make the castle clubhouse, our 3 year old loves it. Our 7 year old is a bit bummed that her box wasn't in good condition, but she's a bit big for it anyway.5) Some reviewers mentioned shedding. They only shed the first couple of days, they don't shed anymore, at least nothing noticeable (and I'm a pretty neat person who would notice something like that). They are not shedding on the rug they're on nor on my kids' clothes anymore.I would purchase this again only because my kids totally love them. That's why I bought memory foam to plump them up rather than return. To be honest, without the foam, they'd probably be a pathetic heap of fluff in a couple of months since they didn't seem full out of the box, and within a week they were noticeably sagging - again, that's with only two light little girls sitting in them.",

Material is leather-like and can be wiped down, which is perfect since she just got a kitten and he\u2019ll still have an accident here and there. Perfect for teens and even fits adults reasonably well. Definitely recommend.",
