Because of its size & no arms \" neurodivergent\" people are loving that they can sit \"criss cross\", while those if us with larger cabooses are just happy we arent squeezed in like a sardine!!This chair is comfortable, looks great. I thought i wouldnt like it because there arent wheels, but i do. Definitely worth it. Its easy to assemble.",
