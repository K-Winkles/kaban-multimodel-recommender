I really wanted to sit in them first, so I could better judge if they were right for me.I found this one, and it was a black Friday deal. It had all the things I wanted, and the price was good, so I rolled the dice.I love this chair. First off, it's big. It's advertised as big, so all these people who've bought it and seem surprised that they got a big chair must not be reading or understanding the description. I'm not a huge person, but I do like freedom of movement and don't like being constricted.This chair is hella stout. I was surprised at how sturdy and well made it is. It's easy to put together. I do recommend that you put it together in whatever space you're going to use it, especially if it's a smaller space or work area.It's very comfortable. The seat is well padded. It rolls easily on the wheels. Reclines nicely.Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase.",

It supports you in a comfortable position even during long working hours. I never feel any strain in my back. The recline function is AMAZING. You can almost lie down completely, and with the leg rest, you can even take a deep nap in it.High Quality: The quality of all the components, from the leather to the wheels and steel, is impressive right from the first glance. You never have to worry about this chair breaking, even when holding a few hundred pounds.Overall, this chair is unquestionably worth the investment.",

I've looked at almost all the big and tall office chairs on Amazon, and basically they're all expensive (250+), and I'm actually not heavy as well as I'm not very tall. But I'm sure there are many of us like me, we buy this type of chair solely because of its sturdiness as well as the width of the cushion. So this office chair is perfect for my needs and most importantly, it is cheaper than almost all big and tall office chairs.So far I'm very happy with this chair and it was a good investment.",

What a ripoff - complete waste of my time, money and expectations. Super dissapointed and feel ripped off.BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK.Well I bit the bullet for a nice chair on amazon and fully regret it. Should have went into a local store and sat down in a some chairs to test them. This chair is super stiff actually (not super comfy like I expected from advertising pics showing springs and memory foam on base cushion) and incredibly tall even at lowest setting. I'd say you need to be 5'8\" tall or more to be able to sit in this chair comfortably (I'm 5'6\" and can only touch the floor with the chair at its lowest height anddddd only then when its leaned forward uncomfortably ! :D).To say dissapointed would be an understatement tbh lol. I want my money back :(",

                "reviewText": "Every time I sit in this chair, or my wife, who sits cross-legged does, it feels like it's going to split in half and fall forward. This chair is supposed to be rated for 500 lbs, and neither of us are near that (though we are bigger people).The issue is where the rod connects to the seat. It's near the back of the seat, meaning that all of your weight bends the rod forward, and strains the wood. I can hear the wood start to creak and bend. It's not a pleasant feeling at all. Luckily the rods that connect the wheel casters are metal instead of plastic, so you won't have to worry about those snapping off.We only got this a week ago, but haven't had any \"real\" problems yet. If this chair lasts a long time, I'll update this review, but it's not a promising first impression.Otherwise, very comfortable, and easy to assemble.",
