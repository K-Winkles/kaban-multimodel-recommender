                "reviewText": "I recently decided to invest in the Finer Form Multi-Functional FID Weight Bench and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. As a fitness enthusiast who does a lot of strength training, I needed a bench that could provide me with the necessary support and functionality without breaking the bank. This bench more than exceeded my expectations, giving me excellent quality for its value.One of the things I appreciated most about the Finer Form Weight Bench was how easy it was to assemble. Everything arrived well-packaged, with clear instructions on how to put everything together. I was able to assemble it on my own without needing any additional help or tools, which is a great relief when dealing with complicated fitness equipment.The bench itself is incredibly durable and well-made. The steel frame is sturdy and can support up to 1000 lbs of weight, and the thick padding on the back and seat provides excellent support and comfort during my workouts. I also appreciate the versatile design of the bench, which allows me to adjust the angle to fit my needs, whether for incline, decline or flat bench press. This makes it perfect for a variety of different exercises, including dumbbell curls, shoulder presses and more.Aside from its functionality and high-quality, the bench also looks great. The sleek, all-black design fits perfectly in my home gym setup, and the bench is surprisingly compact so it doesn't take up too much space. I appreciate the attention to detail the design team has paid to the bench to make it both aesthetically pleasing and practical for use.All in all, I can't speak highly enough of the Finer Form Multi-Functional FID Weight Bench. It's an excellent value, and its high quality and ease of assembly have made it an integral part of my workout routine. Its solid build, comfortable padding, and good looks are a bonus, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable, multifunctional weight bench.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great upgrade from previous model",
                "reviewText": "I've owned the previous model (without the incline) for two years and it still looks brand new after daily use and even a fair amount of stacking boxes and other heavy objects on it. It's still available, and if you're just looking to do core work, it's a great bench. It doesn't fold, but it's easy to stand on its end.I purchased this updated FID version (flat/incline/decline) because it's truly what I wanted two years ago, but wasn't available. There are plenty of bench choices, but to my knowledge, Finer Form is the only one that incorporates an adjustable pad that can be used for preacher curls as well as Roman chair hyperextension. It can also be removed easily if you want more room while sitting.One thing I hate is creaky, squeaky furniture or equipment, and I wasn't sure what to expect for this price point when I purchased the first bench. I was surprised just how good the build quality was, and I can say that the new bench is equally sturdy, and the advertised weight limit has increased to 1000 pounds. I weigh 225 pounds, and there are zero creaks and no wobbles whatsoever. I don't know about the 1k limit, but I could see it easily handling over 400 lbs.Overall, this is a great addition to an at home workout room. The older model is great for core exercises, but not as good as it could be as a weight bench. Most other weight benches are great for lifting, but not well-suited to ab or back work. This newer bench from Finer Form is great for core exercise (sit-ups, hyperextensions), while adding support for dumbbell presses, fly, and other traditional bench exercises. Still not foldable, but still reasonably easy to stand on its end to clear floor space.The only negative I experienced were a couple errors in the assembly instructions that appear to be due to editing mistakes and poor proofreading. Although the instructions are a little confusing, the diagrams are clear and easy to understand. Just make sure to use the correct fasteners as shown in the diagrams, since some are slightly different in size and count.I am receiving no compensation for this review and paid the full Amazon retail price. If you check my review history you'll see I'm not in the habit of reviewing items--good or bad. I took the time to write a review because I'm really impressed with this equipment at an affordable price point. I've also seen some negative reviews regarding missing or poor fitting parts, but I think a small percentage of issues can be expected with any product, and those same reviewers also mention getting great customer service.",

Have only done one work out and it does the job.PROS: for as simple as it is, the frame is solid, study, bit of a wobble during flys but not too bad- ai might need to tighten bolts. One mid bolt didnt want to go in all the way, may need a drill to get it in all the way- bit of tight fit it seems. Fast transition between workouts. Light weight. Back extensions are good enough, I was worried the bench was going to hit my face on the way down, which was not the case\u2026 face comes close to it when bench is down enough to get good sets in, I would use bumbells on each hand for added weight vs plates on the chest. Decent padding.CONS: damaged during shipping- broken plastic cap, scratches, punctured. open parts package, missing parts. Too many moving parts during shipping. Bit wobbly during flys. I was just missing a washer which I bought at a local hardware store. One plastic cap was popped out and broken, will contact vendor to replace. Seems they add or remove parts to the parts package for this model needed or not needed for assembly. Even the manual says to contact them if there is anything missing. Suggest marking parts number on parts package- not sure why instructions use part number but parts package isn\u2019t marked. Cheap thin pleather- if it ever rips I would upholster it with good quality thick leather. Other than that no complaints. Would suggest: extending the curl pads by an inch, I have a wide frame, arms on the edge during curls. An inch wider for the bench board/seat seems a bit narrow during sit ups.Overall decent bench for now, gets the job done, just don\u2019t know how long the pleather will last. It may be a roll of dice of parts when you get it, but once you have all you need its not bad.",

                "reviewText": "This multi-functional weight bench is made with high quality parts. Some nice features include wheels at one end and a handle at the other end, and a removable preacher curl attachment that doubles as a support pad for hyperextensions. The instructions are pretty good and seem to have been written by a native English speaker as there are no grammar mistakes. The diagrams are good and clear up the mistake in 2a where the instructions mention the rotary knob (#26) instead of the casing part (#25). If you have a metric wrench set I would use that over the included double-ended wrench as a dedicated wrench set is easier on the hands.",

                "reviewText": "When I opened the box I closely went through all the parts first to confrim all the necessary bits and pieces were there, which they were. Next, I checked everything for damage and was happy to see there was none. The instructions were relatively easy to follow and it took me about 45 minutes to assemble on my own with the provided tools. If I had been ambitious enough to go grab a real wrench or ratchet instead of the thin stamped wrenches included it might have gone a little faster. Once assembled, the bench seems quite solid. All the pieces that are supposed to move, move and all the pieces that aren't supposed to move don't move. The advertised chart that you can download showing all the exersizes actually came as a rolled up poster you can hang on your wall as fashion decor. The only real problem I have with this bench is doing the exersizes. I have never exersized in my life but I realized I need to start. Some of the exersizes you can do with this bench may well kill me. My hope is that I eventually develop some level of fitness before this happens. We shall see...",

I'm always weary of buying before seeing it, especially for something you plan to keep for 10 - 20 years.I weigh almost 300 lbs, and 6'6. I need something sturdy. This one fell into the \"better than expected\" category, and am very pleased. Long enough for my body, and strong enough to support my fat ash.Assembly went smooth, everything laid out properly. Took an hr and a couple coors to assemble. The only problem I ran into came from the factory. There's two knobs that quick release to change the height or angle of the bench. The threads in the female end on the bench were both full of burrs. Watch out not to cross thread them. Not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal.I'll have this bench for 20 years.",
