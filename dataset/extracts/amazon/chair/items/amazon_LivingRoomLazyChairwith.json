I've actually fallen asleep in it due to the comfort which is rare because I have back problems. It's light but not too light. It took me a minute to trust the straps holding the chair together but they are solid and really hold up.The problems I ran into was mainly the arm cushions turning inward. Which is annoying more than anything but not uncomfortable. The top bar wouldn't fasten securely because the spring peg is missing on one side. And finally, the chair is a bit too tall. I'm 6'0\" and it's a little too tall for me. None of these things bothered me too much.Overall, it's a really good chair for the price and I highly recommend it over most other portable chairs.",

It was going to cost me nearly as much as the chair!!!! I nearly freaked out. Consequently, I didn't send it back. I found someone with a little child who could use the chair so I gifted the chair to them. BEWARE!!!",
