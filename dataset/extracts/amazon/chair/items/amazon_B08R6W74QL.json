                "reviewText": "Finally found a seat & back cover that fits my Steelcase Leap v2 office chair! I had to return multiple seat & back covers because they didn't fit the leap chair; most of the covers I got before only fit the seat part and not the back part, but this fits both. The back part goes over the whole front and back, except for a tiny bit in the front, but you can't see that tiny part it doesn't cover anyway because that part of the chair curves down to the back. When look straight on, it looks like the whole thing is covered. The seat part is completely covered. The only thing I find annoying about this cover is that the seat cover slides forward and kind of displaces sometimes, even when I've secured it with the ties. I don't know if it's the way I tied it lol, so I just changed the way I tied it and hopefully it'll stay better.Overall I like how the fabric stretches, especially the smoothness of the fabric- the fabric doesn't catch as much lint as some of the previous covers I tried. I wanted one that was water resistant, and even though I haven't spilled liquid on it, I like that it supposedly has this feature that would prevent spills if it ever happens.",
