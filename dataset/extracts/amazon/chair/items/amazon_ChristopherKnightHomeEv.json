But I put a nice cushion on top and an otoman to pair with, and I just don\u2019t want to get out of this chair.Back support was decent and sturdy enough that I don\u2019t get a back pain while sitting down. I bought of these chairs and they look good together with a nice side table. My guests also like the chair.Overall easy to put together and pretty to look at. But the back support is not good - it is not soft so its pushing against your back. Since the middle part of the back support is protruding out, all of the pressures are put on your mid-back.",

                "reviewText": "Easy to assemble, Very durable and super comfortable. It has replaced my bed!! Lol I have been sleeping on this comfortable chair for a while now. Yes I come home tired from work but as soon as I sit on this 20 mins in I'm out and get a very comfortable sleep, my muscles don't even hurt when I wake up. My feet hurt from putting them on top of things so I can stretch out while I sleep here. That's how comfortable this chair is!! I actually want to stay in it and sleep as much as I can. I found a soft stool to pit my feet up while I sleep. I also use this as my Footbal watching char and my Gaming chair. I was skeptical buying furniture from Amazon but this was a homerun.",

The instruction sheet was missing pages 2 and 3 - page 4 was printed on the flip aide of page 1. The bolt that is supposed to connect the back to the base is too short, and the chair itself is slightly shorter than what was advertised.For an Amazon Prime Day special I\u2019m not mad about it. But I\u2019m not thrilled either.",
