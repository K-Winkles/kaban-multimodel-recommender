                "reviewText": "I ordered this as a replacement for my son whose chair has seen better days. I liked the option for him to have a footrest, and the mesh backing would be great for intense gaming sessions. Unfortunately, I will have to wait to find out.When the product arrived I carried it to the office and prepared it for assembly. I opened the box and set out all the parts to be inspected, and then I noticed a huge issue. The chair came without any hardware to assemble it! I checked the manual which does indicate that hardware should have been provided, but it was not. This was disappointing so I opted to start by calling customer service to see if they could send the missing parts. After about 20 minutes on hold, I was told that there was nothing they could do and that I would need to return the product and re-order it. Looking at the chair further and it was also apparent that the headrest was not properly secured to its frame causing bunching on the bottom. I can not attest how it would impact comfort as the hardware to attach it needed to be improved, but I hope the quality would have been better for the stated price.This should not occur with such a purchase; especially at this cost. I have filled out all the correct information and now must wait another week for a replacement. Not very happy with the experience.I will update this review when/if the product arrives, and change the review accordingly.Update: They sent out a replacement chair that arrived 5 days later. I had to return the original chair, but the complete parts and improved headrest have arrived.After assembling the item, I can say with confidence that it is not a bad chair, but there are a couple of things I would change.The adjustable headrest needs more adjustability. The ability to move it forward and backward would be a significant improvement. In general, it is comfortable, but it may be a little small if you are over 6 feet tall. The pull-out leg rest is a nice addition, but the end pad would benefit from some adjustability as well. The coat hanger is something I did not know would be so useful, but it is a really simple and solid solution, especially if wearing suits.Comfort while sitting for multiple hours was good, especially for the price point. If it wasn't for my initial experience, this would be a good option to recommend for people looking for a home office solution.This will become my son's primary chair as the quality is good, but the size is a little less than Ideal for me. I will continue to update anything of note, but I am cautiously optimistic.",

                "reviewText": "We were desperately in need of a new chair in our office and this one is awesome. It's a comfortable, breathable, well-built chair with an awesome hidden footrest. Here\u2019s what I like and don\u2019t like about this Horshod office chair:****************************************************LIKES*Easy Assembly- this thing goes from box to assembled in about 20 minutes. The directions are very well laid out and include all the tools and hardware that's labeled with the corresponding step in the manual. It's super easy to put together and they did a great job with the instructions.*Sturdy- I weigh about 190 and this chair handles me with no problem. It feels sturdy and well-built and even in the fully reclined position with my feet propped up I don't feel like it's going to tip or anything is going to break. I've had much heavier people sit in it as well with no signs of strain or braking. It definitely feels well built.*Comfortable- The cushion isn't memory foam but it's very comfortable. The fabric breathes and doesn't feel hot or sticky. The mesh back is a little abrasive on bare skin but provides a lot of ventilation and keeps it from getting hot. It's super adjustable and has an adjustable lumbar position as well as an adjustable headrest that accommodates any position you want to sit in.*Mesh- I really like the mesh back. One of my biggest complaints about last leather desk chair was how hot it got and this one definitely solves that with the mesh fabric back. It also gives while still providing support.*Reclining- this thing goes back pretty far and when you extend the footrest and put your feet up you're basically in a full-blown recliner. It's definitely comfortable enough to take a nap in.*Hidden Footrest- this is my favorite feature. Just looking at the chair you wouldn't know it has a foot rest built in but if you reach under the front of the chair and pull out on the recessed area a foot rest slides out and flips open. It works great and it feels plenty sturdy for just holding up the average person's feet.*Coat Rack- another cool little feature is the extendable coat / sweater rack on the back of the chair. It's extendable so if you have a longer jacket you can keep it up off the floor. This is a nice little touch.****************************************************DISLIKES*Unfinished Edge- My only complaint is one edge of the back of the chair has a bunch of loose threads hanging off where the plastic meets the mesh. It looks like where they stitched it just didn't line up perfectly so the threads are exposed. It doesn't look like a manufacturing defect or like it would affect the integrity of the chair itself. It's just a little bit of an aesthetic thing that looks a little sloppy.****************************************************Overall I'm very happy with this office chair and would absolutely recommend it.",
