                "reviewText": "My chair arrived with a broken piece of the lumbar support that helped lock it in place. I reached out to Colamy's customer support requesting a replacement part, as I had the means to swap out the broken part with a new one. The support team was fantastic and offered to replace the entire chair, free of charge and with no need for a return, which was very generous of them.As for the chair itself, it is a very sold chair with a good design. The head support can easily be adjusted to the perfect position by resting your neck and head against it and using your neck muscles to coax it into the best position. The leg support is very nice and your can essentially get a very supportive, relaxing rest by leaning back and putting your feet up for a few minutes. My only complaint is that the seat is somewhat smaller than my old chair. Fits my butt well enough, but if you are a larger person or like to put a leg up, you may want to explore other options. That said, its an office chair designed for work at a desk and not for lounging, so I can't really knock the design.Assembly was simple and easy. They provide all necessary tools and include a few spare bolts in case you drop one down a vent while assembling. Overall, a good chair for the price from a company that seems to be supportive of its products and cares about good customer relations.",

                "reviewText": "I'm 5'8, 220lbs, wide shoulders and most of the chairs I tried the armrests were too close to the chair and were not comfortable. This chair is nice and wide with adjustable armrests which work like a charm. The pad is really nice, I was very uncomfortable on mesh chair, my legs would get sore and numb, but this chair is great not to firm and not to cushy. Would recommend this chair. Good recline adjustments and great construction. What I would improve is the head rest it's a bit on the lose side, but no complains it works good.",

                "reviewText": "I work from my home office and at my desk 9-10 hours per day\u20265 days a week. I was in need of a sturdy, comfortable office chair and spent several days/weeks looking for the \u201cright chair\u201d. I ended up going with one that I found at a local furniture store\u2026a large warehouse type furniture store. It was $300 and was more of a padded executive type chair\u2026faux leather\u2026looked like I should be drinking brandy and smoking a pipe or cigar in it. It was extremely comfy, but about 4 months of use, it started to fall apart. It was not meant to be used 5-6 days a week 8+ hours per day. I took it back and they actually gave me a full refund! Anyway, I was back on the hunt for a chair. I looked at all makes and models and ended up finding this chair. It didn\u2019t have a ton of reviews, but the ones it did have were all 4.5-5 star ratings. I decided to purchase the chair and figured that I could always return it if it didn\u2019t work out. The chair arrived several days before it was supposed too in a very sturdy box. The chair required assembly, but it literally took me 15 minutes to put it together. The one \u201ctricky\u201d part was attaching the seat base to the back of the chair. The directions state that you need to put the seat base cushion side down on an elevated surface and then bolt the back to it. I flipped the shipping box in its tall edge to do this\u2026worked great! If you\u2019re not handy, you may need someone to assist you with holding the seat back in place while you put the bolts in\u2026but\u2026don\u2019t let that deter you. It\u2019s actually pretty easy. The chair looks REALLY good. It looks way more expensive than it is. My wife has a $600 big name brand office chair and mine looks equally as nice from a quality standpoint and mine also more features/functions. I LOVE the foot rest\u2026use it all of the time. The adjustable lumbar support is great too. I\u2019m 6\u20191\u201d\u2026215 pounds with an athletic physique\u2026and this chair fits my body perfectly. The adjustable arm rests are great too. I have had the chair for almost 3 weeks and so far I am extremely happy with this chair. I give it two big thumbs up!",

                "reviewText": "Was not paid or offered anything for this review; I don't review often but this chair rocks. First of all the quality is top notch, resembling chairs that cost over $500. The back rest is very comfortable, the lumbar support is ok, could use some padding. The seat bucket it self is heavy and super sturdy, the cushion itself is a little stiff but it hasn't broken in yet so not complaining. The chair base is one solid piece covered in metal, very solid. Wheels are fine, nothing to write home about, they roll fine on carpet and bare floor. Arm wrests have a metal supports, the actual arm rests are plastic and seem well constructed as well. Head rest is my only complain, doesn't come forward enough to provide actual support, but if you're sitting ergonomically you don't need a head rest.Overall I would say for the price the chair is 5 star, waaaaaay better than anything else you can buy at this price range",
