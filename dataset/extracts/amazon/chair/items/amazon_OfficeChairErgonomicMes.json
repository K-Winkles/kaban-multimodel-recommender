Tighten the four screws all the way to attach the back piece as shown in the instructions, then go back and tighten the arm screws completely.The only negative thing so far is that the wheels don't move very easily on carpet. Other than that, the chair is comfortable and seems like it will last. This is the second one l bought.",

The build took me about 20 mins to fully assemble, once done I sat in the chair and my posture felt so natural to sit in it. The seat cushion is somewhat firm though but I do not really care to much about it as I sometimes sit cross-legged in my seat.",

                "reviewText": "The chair looks good, is pretty comfortable (I'm not a big fan of the lumbar support bump though), and was pretty easy to put together. No squeaking either, which has been the bane of my last 5 years of chair-sitting. The mesh back is going to be nice in the summer, and I'm loving the headrest. The seat and the padded armrests are nice and comfy. It's actually the perfect size for me. Perfect, meaning that I'm most comfortable at the lowest setting, so I don't have to worry about the gas cylinder eventually failing and dropping the seat. That is the issue with every other single chair I've owned. I guess that also means that if you're shorter than me, say under 5'8, then this chair may sit a little too high for you. Something to consider.",

                "reviewText": "This chair is as comfortable as I would have imagined. It's really hard to buy a chair online. You have to do a lot of guesswork and rely on others reviews, and hope for the best.For the price, it's a really decent chair. The lumbar support, mesh back, and adjustable tilt are good features at this price point. Very few chairs offer so much for under $100. Actually, I don't think any do.The cushion isn't for prolonged, marathon seating, and would benefit from getting a thicker memory foam cushion to place on it for long working or gaming hours. My chair began to squeak, but a bit of WD-40 took care of it. I realized afterward though that I just had to tighten the screws a bit more, and the squeak would go away.The headrest is adjustable, even though the instructions don't really say that. You can slide it up or down to meet your height needs.Overall, it's a pretty good chair for the money. The sellers are great and friendly, and if I needed another, I would purchase from them again.",

The way the arm rest are confines your legs a lot, especially if you have wide or big thighs, it gets very uncomfortable at times and becomes very irritating.2. The back support is almost non existent for me, often I\u2019d find myself slouching in the chair because it was more comfortable than sitting properly.3. The neck/head rest is way too small very uncomfortably4. The metal below the tilt lock broke after 3 months of using it, forcing the chair to be unlocked in a rocking position.5. After about 4 months it started to lean the the right making it feel very awkward and slanted to sit inOverall I\u2019m very unhappy with it I\u2019m giving it 3 stars just because the price meh and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s more comfortable for shorter people",
