But honestly, I could be wrong about that. Either way I made it work! The chair reclines slightly, I certainly wouldn't consider this chair to be reclining.... Not unless I'm reclining wrong as well. There is a large knob under the seat with a plus and minus sign that I can't turn/twist in either direction, its really hard to turn or its not meant to turn, and I'm not sure what it's used for \ud83e\udd14 . But I still like the look of the chair, it's comfortable for my big hips, and the price is right! I also like that the arms move out the way!",

The part that was hard to assemble was the back of the chair and the screws didn\u2019t probably.go in them and I was also missing the letter H in regards to parts. The chair is actually not very wide and is not very comfortable. Since I don\u2019t wanna do this assemble put everything back together, I will give this to my daughter And buy a better quality chair. Very disappointing.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this chair for an additional workstation at home. Overall, the chair is pretty decent in design with a few caveats. Came in a box with a second left side armrest (free of charge I guess). Assembly was fairly easy with the exception of having two of the five wheels that won't fully seat. (Since I'm using it on carpet, it's no big deal for me). Next, the seat bottom is hard as a rock (you'll want to invest in a decent seat cushion) and not very comfortable. Also, the tilt control is very stiff and does not offer much back tilt. Overall, chair is not at all so. Don't think I would recommend this chair if you are intending to use it for longer than 20 minutes or so. Instructions could be a little bit clearer on which direction the tilt and height control lever should face when assembling.",

                "reviewText": "This chair is made of a thick plastic similar, I think, to the thick plastic used to make playground furniture for toddlers. Metal is used where needed. The chair rolls nicely on my carpeting but I bought a chair mat anyway to keep from rolling ruts into the carpeting. The chair is comfortable enough but the back is not at all adjustable. This becomes uncomfortable after an hour or so and I like that this feature keeps me from sitting at my desk all day! The arms flip up perfectly to allow me to wheel the chair under my desk when not in use. The arms are a nice touch for an inexpensive desk chair and comfortable enough for the couple of hours a day that I sit at my desk and want them in the down position. I really like the color and the pouch on the back of the chair. It holds more than I thought it would and it is very useful. If the company could figure out a solution to allow the seat to move back a few inches I\u2019d give this office chair 5 stars!",

The chair is uncomfy and there's not much back support. I had to put a blanket down on the seat to make it a tiny bit more comfortable. Setting it up was a nightmare. Every piece seemed to not want to fit together. I wouldn't recommend this chair to any of my friends. Bad chair.",
