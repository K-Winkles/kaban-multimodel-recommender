                "reviewText": "When searching for a high chair cover I came across this at my local store. I particularly wanted a high chair only cover not a universal one since my daughter is always in her stroller when at the store. I assumed this would be difficult to use and convert to a high chair cover, and boy was I wrong! This is the BEST cover. It easily sits on a high chair with no fuss, with 3 children it is difficult with a toddler and a 10 month old trying to get everyone situated at a restaurant especially with one hand! I can easily put this in her chair one handed, and get her in and out quickly if needed.As for the shopping cart cover part, I never thought I would use it and once again I was wrong! She loves riding in the cart when my toddler is not with us. She plays with the book and loves to get things out of the cart to examine. We can finally shop with ease knowing she is not getting germs! The size is PERFECT for BJ's, Costco size buggy's and even Target or Publix. It fits all carts with no problem. The best part about the shopping cart cover part is that it does not tie down (it has an elastic band that helps it stay on) so when you are one handed once again you can easily slide this on the cart. I had an Eddie Bauer one with my 3 year old that you had to tie to get it on the cart, which is impossible to do holding a baby! I would recommend this to any parent or mom that is looking for a practical, functioning, easy to use cover. When this cover is not in use we put it in a tote in my car to keep it clean and easy to access so it is not laying all over the floor getting stepped on. I love this item and can not say enough about it.",

Est\u00e1 acolchado por el reverso, pero creo que le pudieron poner un poco m\u00e1s de acolchado ya que se logran sentir las rejas de los asientos. As\u00ed que yo le pongo un acolchado extra exactamente d\u00f3nde se sienta.",
