                "reviewText": "I ordered this to replace my previous office chair. I purchased one on sale at Fry's a few years ago, and it didn't even last a year. I have to keep it backed against a wall because the seat back won't support *any* weight anymore. Nuts to that!This chair arrived efficiently packed in a compact box, which was nice. The directions were clear, and it was pretty easy to assemble. I had it together in maybe ten minutes.Visually, the chair is aesthetically pleasing. It's a good looking chair. Functionally, it doesn't have many frills, but it's very comfortable. I can sit in it for several hours at a time without discomfort. It adjusts up and down in a good range, you can swing the arms out of the way, and there is a pocket on the back. I'm not sure if it's for additional cushioning or storage, but I keep the installation instructions back there just in case. That's it for frills, and for the price, that's just fine. I don't regret this chair, and it's already outlasted my previous one.",

                "reviewText": "This office chair comes disassembled, but it is fairly easy to assemble using the clear step-by-step instructions. It took me about 45 minutes, from the time I opened the box until I was sitting in the chair.The main parts of the chair have identifying marks on them, L - for left, R - for right, and Front for Front (of the chair). The chair is held together by bolts which require an \"allen head\" wrench, which is included with the assembly parts. No other tools are needed to assemble the chair.I really like the lumbar support that this chair gives. The chair was nearly perfect to sit in the first time I sat in it. I needed to adjust the height to make it perfect. I also like how the back support is fixed, it does not adjust forward or backwards (sliding forwards or backwards) like some chairs do. The tension for the for rocking setting is easy to adjust, but the tension was set perfectly for me right out of the box.",

She tells me that the chair is incredibly comfortable, I think that it\u2019s lightweight in the right ways and very attractive. The chair legs are sturdy, but thinner than the usual office chairs, giving it a sleek and modern look without sacrificing Structural integrity. The wheels on the legs, because I frankly don\u2019t know what else to call them, spin, super easy and rotate. Super easy.This is everything that you would expect an office chair to have. You can raise the seat or lower it. You can relax the lumbar support when you need to and lean back. It\u2019s a great chair to have.",

The plastic is good quality, but be mindful that the arm rest are plastic. This should not be an issue, but it's something to note.I'm right at 6ft tall and 210 pounds with a medium build and this chair is comfortable for me to sit in while drawing for extended periods.Overall, this is a great office chair. The price is very good and is far better quality than other office chairs I've owned within the same price range. It's very comfortable and well made.",

The chair is adjustable for height and how much force is needed for the chair to recline. It can also block reclining. Although it can recline, the chair forces good posture. You can't really sit too far back into the chair so you have to sit straight up. I guess that's good for work and posture but it does take away from comfort.",

                "reviewText": "This chair is simple, but excellent. I was a bit concerned about what the quality would be like (considering the price), but I'm extremely happy with the sturdiness of the plastic and metal components, and I'm also happy with the the quality of the fabric. There are a limited number of \"features\" (such as the only arm movements are folding up or down), but you have the primary adjustments including height and back (lean and lock). Overall, it is very comfortable and is a nice chair. I'm very happy with this order and would have ordered it again. 5 stars!",
