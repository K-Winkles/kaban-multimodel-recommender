                "reviewText": "I was debating whether to get an entire new office chair with a built-in headrest, but had some misgivings about spending $. Saw this with a 15% coupon which made the price even more attractive and gave it a shot.What's in the box:==============It comes with 2 different sized brackets made to accommodate the the thickness of your chair as well as the appropriate screws sized in length to do the same. You also have the option to screw into your chair directly. Also comes with what they called a 'non-slip' strip which on touching it is not really sticky at all, but maybe for the purpose of clamping this down to your chair it is. Lastly a square piece of mesh cloth to place on the area where you will be mounting the headrest.Assembly=======Pretty simple. Attach non-slip strip to your chair, attach the appropriately sized bracket to the headrest using the right-sized screws, loosely attach the headrest over the mesh cloth and tighten.Cons:====It's really hard to tell if this unit is a good fit for your chair based on the curvature of back as illustrated in the listing. I think it would help if they had a picture someone sitting in an non-compatible chair so we can get a better idea if it will fit yours. It should also be noted that adjustments to this headrest is limited only to adjusting the height. You cannot adjust it forward or backwards.Summary=======Overall a decent buy, but make sure to set some level of limited expectations with respect to chair compatibility and the ability to adjust it.",

I wanted support to rest my head against while just sitting at my computer, but the only way my head rests against this is if lean my head all the way back until I'm fully double chinning, or lean back in my chair to stare at the ceiling. Sitting up straight in my chair, there's 4-5 inches between the back of my head and the headrest, which kind of defeats the purpose of purchasing something to supply head/neck support. Not sure if it's worth keeping",

                "reviewText": "This headrest is exceptional and provides great head support in my Steelcase Leap V2. However, I had to tweak the installation slightly to ensure it stays securely in place. I used the grip installation method (without drilling any holes) but the included piece of cloth was too slippery to use as shown in the instructions. Instead, I used 2 strips of black \"grip premium\" drawer liner from Home Depot (the one that is made of very soft rubber and has square holes in a checkered pattern). With these strips under the metal brackets the grip is very strong. You can then attach the included piece of cloth to the front of the brackets with a double sided tape to neatly hide them. The final result is very elegant.",

                "reviewText": "ECOSI Chair Headrest,Office Chair Head Rest Attachment Adjustable Height & Angle Upholstered Headrest with Elastic Sponge & Nylon Frame for Ergonomic High Swivel Executive Chair,Chair Not IncludedThis could be a money saver IF it works for your chair.If you're looking to extend the comfort of your existing desk chair without a whole lot of money buying a new chair, maybe this could work.I was looking for a new chair with a head rest. But my chair is pretty comfortable so just replacing the entire chair seemed silly. I found this and thought I would give this a shot ....Firstly it is an easy install. Comes with three different brackets to accommodate various chair sizes and thicknesses. ... You simply bolt it on. You also do have option to screw it on with self tapping screws but most likely you won't want to do that. For my chair the bracket and bolt fastened just fine and tight.In terms of comfort , this is where maybe not everyone will like it. For my use I have to adjust the neck height lowest. It sits right at my neck top base and I can sit back and let the head rest just hold my head up. It is exactly what I needed when I have sore neck and I could barely hold my own head up during work. However, depending on your body and need and the type of chair you have, some may find this sticks out too far out and that might be annoying for some.Overall for 45$, it is a great chair mod and saves me from buying a new chair. I personally like it .",
