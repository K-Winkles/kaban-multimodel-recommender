Even with prolonged use, it can still support your waist. The memory foam lumbar pillow's exterior is made of removable and washable 3D mesh fabric, ensuring a cool and comfortable back. Additionally, the lower back pillow features adjustable straps and anti-slip particles on the back to securely fix it onto an office chair.",
            "\u3010Widely Used\u3011: The heated lumbar support pillow is specially designed for truck drivers, office workers, teachers, students, and the elderly. The memory foam is made of polyurethane, making it safe for use by pregnant women and children. It can be used on beds, sofas, offices, airplanes, during travel, as a gift, or in various other situations. You can sleep on your side, back, or stomach with it, and it can also be used as a leg pillow by placing it under the calves or knees."

It is recommended to start with a low temperature for adjustment. If you have any inquiries, kindly leave a message: dikuerus(at)outlook.com Can the lumbar pillow be washed? The office chair lumbar support has a hidden zipper, so you can remove the pillowcase and wash. It is not wash or expose the lumbar pillow core to sunlight in order to avoid reducing its lifespan. It can be hung in a well-ventilated area. How long are the shoulder straps? Are they detachable? The shoulder straps of this office chair back support are 28 feet long (Unstretched) and 1 foot wide, with excellent stretch and resilience. They can be securely fastened to office chairs, and if you don't need them, they can be detached. Can this lumbar pillow be used on an airplane? Fold the heated lumbar support pillow into the included storage bag for easy carrying on the plane, without taking up much space. The back of the support pillow is designed with anti-slip particles, reducing its movement frequency. Will it sag like many memory foam pillows? I want solid support. The lower back pillow is made of high-quality memory foam, which evenly distributes the pressure on the body, avoiding noticeable deformation or collapse after long-term use. When not in use, it will restore to its original shape within 5 seconds.",

                "reviewText": "I love that the heating pad itself is separate from the lumbar pillow- it makes this product so much more than a heated lumbar support. I use the heating pad on my legs, my neck, and other parts of my back, with or without the pillow.The USB controller it comes with is simple and easy to use. It has a small screen, and two buttons to set everything. Clean and simple, even my parents use it without any issues.It gets pretty warm, but not too hot to overheat and feel dangerous. I like the timer option too, because you can turn it on and fall asleep with no worries about it continuously heating and hurting you. The pillow comes in a drawstring carrying case, which was a very nice surprise, makes it easy to store away cleanly.",

The heating effect is also impressive, with three adjustable temperature levels. Plus, the heating pad is detachable, so I can wash the pillow without worrying about damaging the heating pad. The straps of the pillow are removable too, allowing me to attach it to any chair.",
