                "reviewText": "The order came in a very timely manner. The package arrived along with another item I bought from another seller. Packages arrive at the same time and both had some wet spots on it (possibly oil). But when I inspected the box for this chair, it is well packed and all items have plastic seals and bags. So it was intact and clean. Everything was labelled correctly and they even have a cute little tool (tiny and cute screwdiver).The assembly is easy. At first I thought there were no instructions and I am missing items. But when I started opening all the bags, intending to \"figure it out\", I found the instruction sheet in the back of the seat piece. AND ITIS VERY CLEAR. Short, clear and precise. I started from the bottom and worked my way up. Total time: 2 hours and 40 mins. This is because at the end of it, attaching the arm rest and back piece, I realized I mis-understood the manual. It said the other way around. So I had to un-screw it and switch it.The only thing I have to mention is when you start putting the back and arm pieces, lean it on another chair if you are alone. It will fall if you do not have anyone with you. It is heavy and it won't hold in place if you do not either lean it on a chair or table OR if you do not lay the whoe thing down.In terms of quality, as I assembled it, it was the little things. The metal work is a bit mushy BUT, the metal is thick. It is sturdy enough to serve it's purpose. The arm rest has some small scratches on the insides and by the parts where you put your nails and screws in (right round the hole areas and eyon) it. BUT, You won't see it and specifically look for it when you sit here, right? It is unnoticable if you do not specifically look and put your hands in smooth test for it. The leather stitching is a little too tight when I inspected it though, as if the fabric was extended a little too much. But it is okay after everything was assembled. It was just perfect and soft looking afterwards. Just do not pull the fabric or rub on it.The seat and cushion though are SO SOFT AND COMFORTABLE! The chair itself was the perfect size for me. I am 4'11 and 122 lbs. It is firm and cushy for me. The back support was very \"pocky\" for my neck and spine. After working for an hour or so my back, neck and spine gets intense and I lean back to a very pocky chair that eases my neck and back of my shoulders. The spin is stable too and the roll is easy and smooth, even with my 2\" carpet.But I always recommend everyone to wipe the whole thing up. Just to make sure the leather and the whole chair itself is clean. I think this will last a long time for me. :DIt is pretty. It is comfortable. And it serves it's purpose. I think for the price I got it for, IT IS 100% SATISFACTORY.",

                "reviewText": "So I put this chair together about an hour ago and I've got to say...I'm impressed for the price. I read the reviews and was hesitant, but went through with the purchase.Assembly was easy and took me about 30 minutes from cutting the box open. ---The legs seam solid and sturdy; When assembling them the legs were tight and stiff before screwing in, so it seems like a solid base. ---Decent quality wheels (I'm on low-mid height carpet, can't comment on wood/vinyl/tile noise). --- the plastic arms do seem thick and solid enough, but I could see how, over time, outwards pressure could make them snap. That's not how I sit, so no issue for me. --- I saw a few pictures of the metal under the seat breaking, but it seams thick enough for me. If you're pushing that 300 lb limit, maybe it'll go over time. I'm only 160 lb. --- no squeaking or any sort of noise when moving around. --- Initial thoughts on comfort: the chair feels and is shaped comfortably. I'm 6'2\" and did not expect to be able to rest my head back. I can't, as expected. Cushions are somewhat stiff (expected when new), but still very comfortable. I know it will break in some over time. Arm padding is nice, but I think it could be a tad bit thicker. Mine don't look as this as they do in the photos.overall, very happy right off the bat. Besides one indentation in the leather (which will come out in a little time), no damage or broken pieces at all. I will update this review in the future, once I've actually put some use into the chair. -Would recommend for this price range, based off my initial thoughts.(2 MONTHS OF USE) - I've had the chair for just over 2 months. After 1 month, I could see the imprints of the springs coming through the padding of the seat. Still can't really feel the springs, so it's not an issue \"yet\". The arm padding, like I said, is thin...so now where my elbows commonly rest has completely indented the padding. Basically no padding left for my elbows. Other than that, it's still a great chair. Nothing has broken, chair is still silent and I'm still happy with it. The padding could be better, but I'll probably just get a new seat pad eventually (if I start feeling the springs)...... Still happy with the price I paid for it, but padding needs improved. for long-term usage.",
