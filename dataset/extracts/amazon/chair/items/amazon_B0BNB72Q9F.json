I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived. These chairs are so amazing. I put them together alone with two kids running around. Very easy. Two of the chairs did seem to have a slight wobble, but i adjusted the tightness of the legs and they stopped wobbling. The chairs are very comfortable and look expensive. My favorite part is that they are so easy to clean. Perfect for my messy kids. These chairs are awesome for a trendy look on a small budget.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for reasonably priced chairs that would be easy to keep clean, for my kids to use. I\u2019m glad I took a chance and bought these. They came very well packaged with no defects, and they were a breeze to put together. Literally 5 min to assemble both. The seat portion is a nice neutral brown color and is surprisingly comfortable. I like that they sit a little higher up. The legs look fine from a distance, but up close you can tell that they aren\u2019t real wood, and just a wood grain cover. Not a big deal though for the price. Overall, a great deal!",

                "reviewText": "We put the chairs together as soon as they arrived. I really like the look and how well they fit around our table. They are very comfortable and of a wipeable vinyl fabric that seems durable and well-seamed. The seat height is good and about 2\u201d-3\u201d higher than the seat height of our previous chairs. This might be an issue with a lower dining table or one with a deep apron. Surprisingly, the legs are metal and all one piece, which makes them exceptionally sturdy. I expected separate wooden legs. The metal \u201cwood look\u201d single leg piece is much better.A few notes on assembly:1. The one-piece metal leg unit that attaches to the base of chair has two curved bars and two flat bars. Attach the curved bar sections to the back two holes and the flat bar sections to the front.2. Until all the screws and washers are attached, just tighten them enough to hold so as to assure all the holes can be aligned.3. Once aligned, tighten the screws to the \u201csnug\u201d point but not beyond to prevent stripping the pre-threaded receptors.Overall these chairs are of a much better quality than we expected and an excellent value.",
