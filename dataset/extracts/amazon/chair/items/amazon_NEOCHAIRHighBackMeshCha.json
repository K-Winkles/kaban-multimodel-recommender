                "reviewText": "Suffering from scoliosis, it's difficult to find a chair that fully supports my curved back. When I saw this, I thought I'd give it a try, but I was hesitant. And I wasn't disappointed with the back support. However, there are a few drawbacks:1) The first three wheels were easy to install; the fourth a little difficult and the fifth was an absolute bear. Husband had to take a heat gun and heat the post and then push it in.2) Per the enclosed diagram, the lever to raise and lower the chair is inaccurate. In order to raise the seat, you need to push down on the lever, then stand up slightly.3) Installing the bolts can be tricky so do exactly what the directions say: Leave them loose until just about everything is installed. This way, you can make any adjustments easier. You might need a second person to help; I managed to do this on my own but I could have had another person helping.4) Yes, the chair back comes in a gray color, no matter what color you order (I ordered beige).Positive comments:The instruction booklet is well laid out with clear diagrams. I got a chuckle out of the reference to not get your hand caught when installing the fifth leg; it created a personal touch.The language is easy to understand.Would I buy another? Sure!",

Usually you have to balance something on something else just to get the screw holes to line up. The engineering usually seems like it was done by someone that's never actually put furniture together -- but not with this chair.It may not sound like a big deal but the ease of assembly made a big difference for me. They look nice and are comfortable, too. Especially for the price. They don't look or feel like a less-expensive chair. Thank you to the people who make these!!",

I love that fact that you can have the back completely sturdy and still or you can pull the level underneath out to make it rock back and forth with your body. I have a lot of hip and back issues and the way the chair pad is designed makes it super comfortable and takes the pressure off my hips and tailbone when sitting. Love this chair! Works amazingly.",

                "reviewText": "Ok, so I got this back in April. It's now July. That's three months right? Well that's how long it lasted. If you look closely at the product picture there's a seam on top of one of the legs. Well that's because for whatever reason that leg is the only one that comes detached. Why does it come detached? I couldn't tell you. The box it comes in is big enough for it to be a single structure base like it should be.Anyways, during that three months it was an ok chair. Once you get past how terrible the foam padding is. The arm rests are short and the foam is barely a quarter inch thick. The seat has about 2.5 inches of what I can only describe as that basic yellow spongey foam. You bottom out in it pretty fast.The \"lumbar support\" sits so far back in the chair that it doesn't actually do anything unless you force yourself all the way back. And at that point you kinda go past the cushion.The wheels are made out of rubber which is the only thing I'm going to give them credit for (at least for the thought). They stay out pretty well and don't roll out from under you when you go to sit. However, they will pick up literally everything they roll on top of and it's pretty gross.Now, on to the leg. I'm not rough on any of my furniture whatsoever. There's not really any good way of sitting in this where it feels stable unlessyou put two legs in like a tripod position in the back. This causes an issue because if the detachable leg ends up in the back it very very quickly becomes an issue. The plastic that the base is made out of is pretty soft and that's where the biggest flaw is. Any time you lean back you put pressure on that leg if it's in the back. The plastic that it goes into is rather thin but the actual wedge on the leg that slots into the base is solid. Lean back too many times and that plastic flexes, wears out, then splits. A couple days before the leg broke out of the base I was confused why it seemed like it was leaning back and to one side. That should've been my first inkling that it was breaking. When it did break it dumped me backwards out of the chair and onto the floor.My recommendation for them is to make the base one solid base. Don't add more failure points than you have to. Literally one of the first rules of design. Adding a detachable leg overcomplicates things. I'd also recommend that they add a sixth leg to it because really it could've used it. Or at the very least switch the plastic that's used and give the detachable leg a little more to slot into. Less than a quarter of an inch for the walls is not enough when the wedge on the leg is solid plastic.Its been 6 months since I bought it. I just had to buy a new chair because the back broke off of it. DO NOT BUYTldr: don't buy this. Idk how or why this chair has so many high reviews. Wouldn't be surprised if they're paid for because while it's a cheap chair, it should've lasted much more than 3 months.",
