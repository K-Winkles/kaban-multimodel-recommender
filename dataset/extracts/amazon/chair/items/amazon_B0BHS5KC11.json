After looking for a while, comparing different styles, I had chose the Blue Whale Big and Tall office chair. The reason I picked it was because it can support my weight easily and it look very sturdy. In addition, the sitting surface is not just a flat piece of foam.The package came quickly and on time, thanks to Amazon. It took only about 15 minutes to assemble. The screws was prepackaged into numbered square so you can't go wrong on picking which screw for which part. After putting it together I sat in it and felt my back was supported and the seat was soft but yet hold me in the chair. The wheels rolls on the carpet freely and smoothly and the hand rest was adjustable.I am about 6 feet and I can sit on it with chair in the lowest position and both feet on the floor without feeling stretched. Back support is adjustable so it can fit me just right. The back piece of the chair can be titled into 3 different positions, so if I feel I need to lean back, it can accommodate me. Overall I found this chair is worth the money spend.",

                "reviewText": "I have bought multiple office chairs on Amazon and gave them all away because they were either too big or extremely uncomfortable. You know, those chairs that have the waterfall seat and you feel like you are going to slide right off the chair and onto the floor? Not with this chair!!! I bought the 500lb limit option, not that I weigh anywhere close to that, but I do like crossing my legs while I am working my 9 hour shift at my desk. This has a wider seat so I have enough room to comfortably cross my legs without a arm rail pushing onto my legs. Let's talk about the seat cushion....it is beyond comfy. My bottom has never felt more comfortable. It is like sitting on a cloud. This is definitely a soft and butt forming seat. You will not feel like you are sitting on a board by the end of the day. Ok the back of the chair. It has a movable lumbar adjustment. I can say I dont like a pre-fixed lumbar on a chair. We are all shaped differently and most of the time a pre-fixed lumbar feels like it is taking up most of the depth of the seat. Not on this chair. You can adjust the height and intensity to fit your body shape. Are you wondering if the arm rests are padded? No they are not....But you can buy some arm pads for them. The arm rails are extra wide and around 10\" long. I found a pair of arms pads that fit it perfectly, that do not slide around or come off during use. The pads are 9.5\" long, but are made to fit a 10\" long arm rest. The arm rests are adjustable too....you can raise them up for those taller people, or if you just like having higher arm rails.Next is the wheels. I did not use the wheels that came with the chair, although they are good quality. I put on foot brakes that keep the chair from moving while I am sitting in it, just my preference.Height adjustment, this chair is made for both short and tall people. I am 5'5\" and most chairs I have to put the height to the max. Not on this chair, I have it only about half way up to it's highest setting. So if you have long legs, this chair is for you.Last on my list to tell you about-- assembly! I had this chair put together in about 15 to 20 minutes. I am a 56 year old woman, with arthritis in my wrists and hands....If I can put this chair together on my own, so can you. There is no fighting to get the back of the chair to line up with the holes in the seat or arm rests. This was the easiest chair I have ever put together. It comes with the nuts, bolts and tool to assemble it. So, you don't have to break out the toolbox to put this chair together.Oh, one last feature I forgot to mention.....you can adjust how far back you want your chair to lean back. I dont like those chairs that when you lean back you feel like you are going to do a backwards summersault right onto the floor. You can adjust how far back you want to rock or just lean back in the chair. If you dont want to lean back, you can adjust it to not rock or lean back at all, and you dont have to climb under the chair to make that adjustment.Well, you wont be sorry purchasing this chair. It is high quality and made to last a very long time.",

The legs are metal meaning they won\u2019t snap, the seat is definitely wider and it\u2019s very firm but comfortable. The padding is very thick on the seat, the mesh back is awesome and comfortable. It was mostly easy to assemble, my only small trouble was trying to figure out what was the back and what was the front of the seat as there was no arrow and no words in the instructions. It\u2019s very well built and for the price I\u2019m in love with it, I actually have a couple of friends who want to get it now.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this after a rather disappointing purchase of another office chair. While it took a little bit to assemble it was actually very easy to. I just had a problem putting the back on the base, turned out you needed to push hard on the back so the screws would take purchase. I think that was mostly operator error. The lumbar support is very nice, you can adjust it to your exact specifications. The cushion on is this chair is ooohhh so comfortable. The mesh back is nice, it keeps your back from getting to hot. It doesn't like to roll on carpet, however the purchase of a plastic mat lets it roll fine. It also rolls fine on wood flooring and laminate flooring. When they said it would hold 450 pounds they weren't kidding this thing is built heavy and strong. I would recommend this for anyone who is overweight, you'll get a chair you will not worry about tearing up the first time you use it.",

                "reviewText": "You get what you pay for. This chair was cheap and so was the quality. The one good thing that I have to say is that the seat was wide, but it was completely lacking in comfort. My butt hurt after a few hours, there was very little padding and the wood that was under the cushion was very thin. The back of this chairs is a joke. The main support that holds the back to the bottom of the chair is plastic with brass nut inserts to hold it to the bottom. I could not lean back in this chair. As I leaned back the chair just kept bending backwards. The vertical back of the chair was flimsy and with thin material with no metal structure. The so called lumbar support was made of the same cheap plastic and just bent right out of shape when leaned upon (see pics). No support at all. I'm a big guy over 300 lbs. I did not feel safe in this chair. Over the years I have bought a few chairs from Amazon that were much higher in price and quality. This was the worst chair I have every bought. Save yourself from wasting time, pay for a higher priced chair and get a quality one.",
