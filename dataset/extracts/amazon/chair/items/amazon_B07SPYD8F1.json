I didn't get to test the full weight claim, but someone nearly 400lbs sat in one and said it felt very solid. The seats are definitely an inch or two wider than most folding chairs.They fold easily, and the handle in the back of the chair is very convenient. The molded plastic seat is sturdy and reasonably comfortable.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these chairs for a friendsgiving in which we had children and a few heavier people at. Everyone was able to sit in them. The kids played on them and they did not collapse. easy to unpack and pack back up. light weight with easy to transport handles. They would be easy to clean if needed. I am very satisfied with how quick they got here as well. They were supposed to arrive by 10 on the day I needed them which I did not realize. but they got here at noon. All around I am very happy and recommend!",

I had purchased for the kids' table for Thanksgiving and the price was cheaper than Costco so I was delighted when they arrived on time AND they were big and sturdy. I would have felt comfortable sitting in them or having plus size family members sit in them. Good purchase for sure.",

                "reviewText": "Die St\u00fchle machen einen sehr stabilen eindruck. Das Plastik ist nicht verformbar und die Gelenke sollten auch bei \u00f6fterem Gebrauch nicht ausleiern.Die Sitzh\u00f6he betr\u00e4gt 45 cm was aus der Produktbeschreibung nicht hervor geht. Dies passt in meinem Fall zu der Sitzh\u00f6he der vorhandenen St\u00fchle. Die Stuhlbeine sind gummiert und kratzen somit nicht am Boden.Man kann die St\u00fchle zum verstauen gut zusammengeklappt ineinander stellen und tragen somit nicht viel an Tiefe auf.Sch\u00f6n w\u00e4re es gewesen wenn bei wei\u00dfen St\u00fchlen neben der Lehne und Sitzfl\u00e4che auch die Metallstangen in wei\u00df gewesen w\u00e4ren.Kritikpunkt ist die leicht nach hinten gerichtete Sitzfl\u00e4che. Als Beistellst\u00fchle zum Esstisch daher nur bedingt empfehlenswert da man sich hier doch nach vorne aufrichten muss. Dies wurde von allen G\u00e4sten bem\u00e4ngelt die auf diesen St\u00fchlen gesessen sind. Als tempor\u00e4re L\u00f6sung jedoch akzeptabel.",
