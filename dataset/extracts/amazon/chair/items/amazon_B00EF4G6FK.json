                "reviewText": "This item arrived much faster than expected so I start the review already impressed with the seller.The chair itself was very easy to assemble. I entered the search query \"assemble office chair\" into Google and was linked to a video of the assembly of a very similar chair. I then opened the box, organized the parts and started assembly. It took about 15 minutes to go from in oxing to sitting in the fully assembled chair. The directions are helpful because there is a very useful diagram included that can be used to reference how things should be put together. There were no accompanying instructions but there are only 6 screws to contend with so a picture sufficed for the purpose.The chair itself is lightweight, yet sturdy. It sits comfortably and rolls smoothly, although it's not the most quiet chair when in motion.My only criticism is I wish the padding were a bit thicker in the seat. While the chair is comfortable I expect this part of the chair will be the first to show signs of wear after a few months. For the price though, you can't complain.Overall, if you need office chair to accommodate a couple of hours of reading, web surfing or the like this is a solid purchase. While not a premium experience, this is a good value for the money purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I'm 6-4 and need height for comfort with my leg angle. This seat easily accomplishes that. Good news!Seating for an extended period leaves a small bit to be desired, as there's little seat padding. That said, it's very comfortable, as is the back rest.Its lightweight construction has so far not meant \"cheap\" - but merely not-heavy, and it rolls very easily on the thin chair mat I have over the carpet in the seating area.It arrived in a very compact flat pack, and assembly was very straightforward. I'm mechanically inclined, so everything which was in the shipping box made perfect sense to me; I looked at the instruction page later, and found it very easy to follow if the parts hadn't immediately made sense to me.Of course, it comes with the hex tool needed to tighten the machine screws provided, and keeping it for later will assure you that if, after years of use, you've had one or more of the fasteners loosen, you can re-tighten it.Great value for a pittance compared to the office stores' offerings.Highly recommended for occasional use; if you're going to be sitting in it all day long you might prefer something with a bit larger and softer seat, but that's the only \"complaint\" I can muster.",

                "reviewText": "I've recently started working from home for a remote call center, and had to find a chair to fit a very small desk in a cramped work space. I also had almost no budget to work with, so cost was a huge factor. I crossed my fingers and ordered this chair, precisely because of the measurements and the price, figuring I'd \"make do\" with it until I could afford something better. Now I'm almost in shock over how much I like it!Not only does the chair fit the space I'm working in, but it fits *me* very well. I'm short in stature, so the curve in the back rest is in the exact right place to provide the promised lumbar support. The mesh back has just enough flex to keep it from feeling stiff or rigid, even though the back is fixed in an upright position. I can tell I'll eventually need to use an extra cushion in the seat, because it will probably compact with steady use. But for now, it's adequately comfortable to sit in for a work shif. Assembly was easy and took all of ten minutes. As a bonus, the chair arrived a full week earlier than the projected delivery date.I absolutely get why this wouldn't work for everyone - this is definitely a \"task chair,\" rather than an \"executive chair\" to do a lot of \"lounging like a boss\" in. And a big or tall person would probably be miserable in it. But for me, it has turned out to be exactly right. I also think it would be great for a teen student who is doing \"remote learning\" for now.",

                "reviewText": "This is very inexpensive for an office desk chair. It's more comfortable than I might have expected for this price, compared to more expensive (yet still low cost) options from places like Ikea.The chair ships in pieces in a relatively small cardboard box, with easy to follow installation instructions, the required screws, a couple of spare screws, and an allen wrench. Nothing else is needed.I like the look of it. I like that it is fabric and mesh instead of less breathable materials. I actually like that it doesn't have arms, because chairs with arms tend to get caught on my keyboard tray when I step away from the desk.Here's what's not so great: The chair bottom looks and feels nice on inspection, but after sitting in it for even just a few minutes, it's clear that it doesn't provide enough cushion and not quite enough depth. I'm an average height man at slightly below average weight. Further, the chair height adjusts, but I want it to be at about its lowest position. So after adding a pad to the seat for extra cushion, the discomfort is transferred to my thighs.",

He has a Spider-man theme and the back design of the chair almost looks a little \"webish\" so it goes well with everything. He's able to fit in the chair and has plenty of room to grow into it. I thought the assembly was fairly easy. I read the previous reviews and followed the directions step-by-step. I made sure I didn't tighten the bolts in the arms and in the back of the chair until I had all of them in place and halfway screwed in. I think there were only 8 screws that involved screwing on the arms to the chair. I didn't have any difficulty. I did it by myself and did not need any assistance from my husband. It took me approximately 20 minutes to assemble once I had everything out of the box. The chair is comfortable and easy to adjust.",
