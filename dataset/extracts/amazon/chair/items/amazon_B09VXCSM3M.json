Place the arms to either side of the seat, then see how close the back comes to fitting between the arms. Mine was about 1/3 inch short. Doesn't sound like a lot, but it is--especially when the predrilled screw holes aren't quite right.Then, slide each leg onto the stand and just drop a screw through each hole to be sure each leg hole is lined up with the one underneath. The assembly should have been easy, but definitely was not. When successfully assembled, the chair IS comfortable, but it does squeak. Again, this should have been an easy assembly.",

                "reviewText": "I searched everywhere for an affordable office chair that wasn\u2019t the standard black or gray since my \u201coffice\u201d is also my guest bedroom. This shade of pink is a nice muted rose and perfectly blends with my decor. I haven\u2019t spent an 8 hour workday in it yet, but so far it feels very comfortable with good lower back support. The instructions were very easy to follow - I have a handheld ratcheting screwdriver that I used in the assembly, if I had to use the included Allen key I think that would have been frustrating and much more time consuming since some of the screws required more force to tighten different pieces together securely. Overall, super happy with this purchase and price point.",
