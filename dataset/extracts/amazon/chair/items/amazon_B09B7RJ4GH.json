We\u2019ve done baby-led weaning (starting with finger foods) with all our kids, which in the past meant tons of food getting tossed to the floor and wasted. But now, with the Catchy, I just scoop discarded food up and hand it right back to Baby. It catches pretty much everything, and after meals I can easily slide it right to the sink or trashcan to wipe off any leftover food that\u2019s been squished beyond recognition. It\u2019s easy to assemble, keeps our floor clean (especially useful in our carpeted dining room), and saves me time.",

She can\u2019t get under the chair anymore and there are almost no food particles that end up on the floor. Our Shiba is around 23 lbs and kind of tall for a Shiba Inu.The tray is easy to clean and the side with the black writing should be facing the floor so the side facing the baby is all white(I\u2019d seen a review where someone had installed it upside down and was complaining about the black ink smearing onto the baby). Also, when installing it is important to do the corner tabs in alphabetical order. If you don\u2019t it\u2019s much harder for some reason.I use this on the boon grub high chair and it fits perfectly. Now I almost never need to wipe the floor after meals. I do recommend this item.",

It does exactly as promised, is easy to install on the chair, and as my baby is starting solids it will not only catch sneakily dropped toys and teethers but also food for easy clean up. It wipes up/cleans easily, is large enough to catch most dropped items that aren't flung away, and has already been a sanity saver for my husband and me. We picked this over similar competitor items as it's larger and has a better chance of catching everything.The only cons so far are price (it's a cleverly cut plastic sheet; it feels overpriced to me) and that it is not easily removable; the entire seat and backrest(s) must be removed in order to install this thing, so once it's on it is unlikely you'll be willing to take it off frequently or at all.",

I can\u2019t find a single product that would fit the high chair and I didn\u2019t want a floor one because the whole point is to keep the dogs from eating things they can\u2019t have. I don\u2019t want to buy a whole new high chair just to use a catcher. I am not sure why high chairs don\u2019t just come with some sort of a catch tray because 100% of all babies throw food. Design flaw for sure.This does NOT fit the evenflo chair, BUT nothing does so I made it work. Although it looks rough, it still catches the food and that is all that matters.",
