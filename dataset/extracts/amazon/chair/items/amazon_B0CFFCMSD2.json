                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This office chair is a great alternative to those that cost hundreds more, even in the pre-owned/secondhand marketplace. The value for the price paid is great because of its build quality, ease of use, good ergonomics, and overall aesthetic.I spent a good amount of time weighing my options of a used Herman Miller or this and I'm so glad I chose the TONFARY. It's nice to have something new of your own and to get a good deal on something. The ability to customize arm height and angle, headrest support, and seat height for a reasonable price were all important factors in the decision. Materials were too, and the webbing on this chair is very durable.The lumbar support is also a huge benefit. The tilt range is also very generous. Assembly took me 40 minutes, but I was half watching a preseason football game at the time. With proper focus, I think 30-35 minutes is reasonable.The chair was very well packed, with strong cardboard inserts, plastic wrapping, and extra hardware just in case.",
