I researched a lot of these knowing I did not want one that would collapse.The only issue I had was when I opened it, I had a hard time it was packed very tight. Part of the material was tied into the knot of the plastic, which I you could not see it. I had to cut the knot, again not realizing the material was into the knot. It cut a hole inside the pocket.I tried to patch it, lets hope it holds. Just be very carful opening it.",

It is very compressed when taken out of the box, and it says to let it adjust 24-48 hrs before using it. But after about 2 hrs it looked all puffed up and ready to go! The only drawback to the bed was the shipping, the dates changed at least 4x and it went from being late to being early and back and forth. It did land up being about a week late than the latest date change, but aside from that, i would def recommend the chair. it even pulls out to become a little comfy bed!!",
