Das Material des Bezugs ist Meshgewebe und die F\u00fcllung ist Memory Schaum. aAuf der R\u00fcckseite des Bezugs sind Anti-Rutsch-Noppen.Ich nutze das Kissen sowohl auf dem Sofa, auf meinem Schreibtischstuhl und im Sessel.Deswegen nutze ich auch die Gurte nicht, ich nehme es immer dahin mit wo ich gerade sitze...Eigentlich wollte ich das Kissen auf meinem Stuhl auf der Arbeit nutzen, da ich von dem Stuhl immer noch zus\u00e4tzliche R\u00fcckenschmerzen bekomme. Da ich aber einen Arbeitsplatz habe an dem sehr viel Schmutz entsteht, ist mir das Kissen jetzt zu schade daf\u00fcr und ich nutze es lieber zu Hause.Mir pers\u00f6nlich hilft das Kissen bei akuten Schmerzen und auch dabei eine richtige Sitzposition einzunehmen.Ich finde es sehr bequem auch bei l\u00e4ngerem Gebrauch.Es passt sich optimal an und unterst\u00fctzt ohne das es unangenehm wird.Grade wenn sich mal wieder ein Hexenschuss anbahnt, bin ich froh das ich dieses Kissen habe.Ich wei\u00df nicht warum, aber sobald ich es dann im R\u00fccken habe l\u00e4sst der Schmerz nach. Klar vollbringt das Kissen keine Wunder und ich brauche trotzdem noch ein Schmerzmittel, aber es tut echt gut f\u00fcr eine halbe Stunde Schmerzfrei zu sitzen und zu warten bis das Schmerzmittel wirkt.Das ist aber alles nur mein subjektives Empfinden und jeder muss f\u00fcr sich austesten was ihm wie am besten hilft.F\u00fcr mich ist das Kissen echt super, ich bin froh das ich es habe und w\u00fcrde es auch anderen empfehlen.",
