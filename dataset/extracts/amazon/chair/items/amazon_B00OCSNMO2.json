                "reviewText": "I bought this to replace my old, el cheapo office chair that was falling apart and was causing me to slouch very badly.It was that type of office chair that was some cushion on top of plywood that you'd be feeling after 20 minutes.I was searching for a chair and at the time, needed something that was very affordable. I decided on this one because it was mesh and one of my friends with really bad back problems got it after doing lots of research, and he recommended it to me.When I got this chair in... oh my gosh.... you cannot possibly understand how life-changing it is to have a proper, solid office chair, especially if you're like me and spend hours each and every day at your desk, in your chair.I'm 5' 7\" 120lbs, this chair supports me perfectly, headrest is at the perfect height. The mesh is great, very breathable and supportive.The modularity is great, you could strip the entire thing down to a stool if you so desired. I keep the arm rests off to make getting in and out of the chair easier, and sometimes I detach the headrest when playing VR while sitting. I understand they're forced to do this to fit the chair into a smaller box for cheaper shipping, but it's still appreciated.The build quality is... well, plastic, but pretty hard and solid plastic. The back shroud that covers the metal bracket that mounts the back rest to the seat is the weakest point and has cracked, but otherwise it's been great after 2 and a half years of continuous use. And let's be real, you can't complain about build quality at this price point.Overall, definitely get it if you can.Do not hold off on it and consider buying something else, yeah a new graphics card is cool and all but framerates don't matter if it hurts to sit in your chair.You'd think I'm joking, but my buddy I mentioned earlier messed up his back after years of construction work and a bad motorcycle accident.He has a triple screen 1440p 144hz setup with a 4090 but there's days where he wants to play and can't because of his back pains.So, seriously, do your research and consider ergonomics, and definitely consider this chair.Pic 1: Aug 2022 Pic 2: Oct 2023",

                "reviewText": "I had a very bad quality \"gaming: chair before I bought this one and wow. When I tell you the difference of sitting in each chair is extremely different, you will not believe me. The Hyken Techinal Task Ergonomical chair has made a big difference in the way I sit, and looks great in my setup.Assembly of the chair wasn't \"hard\" but it did take a while to do. It comes in very simple instructions and tells you which screws go where. They give you all the screws and tools needed so you don't have to buy anything extra. I did it by myself but it would have ben easier with another set of arms to help. It only took long because I had to screw every screw in. Other than that, it was an easy job with straight forward instructions.The build of the chair seems very sturdy with a net like fiber for back and leg support. The chair does NOT feel cheap in anyway. The plastic is nice and has a good feel to it and it does have metal as a main frame support, meaning the chair is relatively heavy. The chair feels reinforced and feels like it will not break on you at anytime so that's a plus.The arm rests go up and down so you can move them according to your desk. The chair goes up and down in height. It also has the ability to lean back so you don't have to be sitting straight up all the time and relax. Even when you are laying back, you don't feel slouched nor stiff. You always feel comfortable yet in a good posture. The wheels seem pretty well made. While assembling, they were a little difficult to put into place but eventually they fit into the stand.The chair does feel kind of small so if you are bigger in body shape or height, this chair might not be great for you. I'm 5'8\" and it does feel a bit small but barley. The only thing that feels small for me is the seat. The backrest feels perfect in size and back support.Definitely would recommend this chair instead of a gaming chair. I can spend hours on end on the chair at my desk and not feel my back straining or stiff in anyway. Again, it is very comfortable and helps a lot with posture.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Great Back Support",
                "reviewText": "TLDR: Pros: It has great back support. I have yet to be in pain after sitting for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week minimum for the past 3 weeks I've started using this chair. It can lean back and adjusted to your comfort. As this was the most important thing to me, I say it's worth every penny.Cons: The wheels get stuck a lot so it makes it a little harder to scoot around. But I assume those can be swapped out. The only other thing for me is that my left arm tends to get uncomfortable a lot while resting on the armrest. I'm not sure if it's just my position or what (my right arm is completely fine but it's typically not resting on it). It's not worth giving it 1 star but it's definitely not a fun feeling after a while. It's just something for me to consider in the future when I move on to another chair.______Biggest thing for what I was looking for in a chair was good back support. I have really bad back pain and I work from home. I was sitting on a really uncomfortable couch for a while and decided since it looked like I'd be working from home for at least the next few months, it would probably benefit me to get an actual chair. After doing some searching for office chairs under $200, this one was listed with high regard. Browsing through the reviews only further supported my interest. It was then I decided to order it.It came here super quick, I mean like within a matter of days and it wasn't even under prime! Easy to assemble and I do 0 handy work. Easy to understand instructions and great diagrams.Overall, very happy. Gladly recommend someone who is looking for a cheaper chair that has amazing back support.",
