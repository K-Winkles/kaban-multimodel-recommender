                "reviewText": "I bought this ergonomic chair for use with my dining table, as I spend a fair amount of time each day with my 75 year old body sitting in it. It arrived in fine condition, assembled quite easily, has great leather-like skin and just-right padding in all the right places.One year later, this chair - with all of the use it has gotten - is in exactly the same fine condition as when it arrived. That is to say: no signs of wear, no flattening of the padding and it remains as comfortable as ever! I really like the taupe color.Yes, it does look just a little weird with the three dining chairs, but at my age, I could care less. I double my dining table as a desk and the entertainment system is across from the table. My poor back really loves this chair! The adjustable ergonomic back support actually works.I thought a long time about adapting an ergonomic office chair to my dining set, and after a year's use of this particular chair, I have absolutely no regrets.I would not hesitate to buy this chair, or any other product from this manufacturer.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars It's a decent chair that can be hard to assemble due to the the finish of the assembly parts.",
                "reviewText": "I'm sitting in it right now. This chair is all about lumbar support. It's also stiff yet cushy enough. The height adjusts well. The tilt back feature is kind of useless unless you want to rock backwards for some reason -- mid-day stretch routine? Swivels left and right nice. Rolls around good. I bought this since I'm hybrid at the office, which works out to me going into the office twice a month. So, I needed a real office chair for home.Assembly: UGH! Even if you follow the instructions perfectly, it's hard enough. If you're someone who is used to assembling Amazon or IKEA-bought \"you build it\" furniture, you'll get this chair project done. But the metal castings inside the seat and back that the various screws go into vary in quality. For two screws that secure the arms to the chair and hold the seat and back of the chair to the arms' framework, it was really hard to thread two of the screws in with the included tool. I don't have a power tool screw driver with an allen wrench head, or a power screw driver at all, so i was working up quite the sweat getting the screws in.But at some point I learned that the included tool has two of the same-sized allen wrench ends, and the short end is so you can get more torque when you are putting the screws in. But still, I would say that there is something a little wrong with the machining of two of the holes because it took crazy force to get the screws all the way in.Also, it will be key to have someone hold the back steady as you attach it to the arm assembly that holds the chair together.Also, the reason the directions tell you to only 50 percent tighten the screws that go into the arm/seat/back assembly as you assemble is so you have some give to work with as you line up the subsequent screws into their holes through the arm assemblies and into the seat and back. When all the screws are in at 50 percent, then you can tighten them to 100 percent.Happy sitting!edit: After using this chair for three days, it's just about perfect. It would be perfect if the arm rests were adjustable two inches up or down. But, it's easy to flip them up and not use them at all.edit 2: After five months of use, still a great office chair.",

                "reviewText": "I have had a few office chairs in my day. But, being only 5'2\", I never found one that really fit me...before now! Once it was assembled, I sat down and literally said, \"ahhhh!\" I can put my feet flat on the floor! The armrests fit under my desk! The lumbar support actually sits where it should on me! I have short legs, a short torso, short arms, basically the whole munchkin thing and this chair feels so nice!I tell you, it might be wrong to be this excited over office furniture, but I don't even care. I do think it may not work for you if you are over a certain weight/size. Check the seat width measurements to make sure it will fit you well. I'm an average weight and am very comfortable. If you have a long torso, the lumbar may not be in the right spot for you, so consider that as well.The color is nice, a very elegant-looking \"greige\" leaning more to the beige side. I think it looks really nice for the price point. The seat cushion is very comfortable so far, but I haven't spent hours and hours in it yet. If it becomes less comfortable over time, I will update the review.I didn't have much trouble assembling the chair, though I do think it would be faster and easier with two people. The hardest part was putting the back on, since if you are alone, you have to balance it carefully to line the screw holes up, and it is awkward. If you assemble it on your own, I suggest putting the two bottom screws in first to stabilize, then going back and adding the top ones on each side.Since I just got the chair, I can't speak yet on its durability long-term, but I'll update my review if it doesn't hold up. I plan to be proactive in caring for the bonded leather to protect it from peeling, so hopefully, I can enjoy the chair for a long time!",

                "reviewText": "Really pleased with the chair. It has a nice high back, but don't go into it expecting head or neck support. Strong, supportive base, though I did buy wheels that are rubber and more high end separately. The seat isn't as wide as I had expected, so likely unsuitable for a heavy set or wide hipped person. The height lift can be locked into place, but the tilt cannot. It is not breathable, but you should already know that based on the material. Very easy to assemble, though heavy, so required a second set of hands at a certain point. The only issue I had is that a couple of the screw covers wouldn't fit into place, even with a bit of hammering- which is over all not a big deal. Easy to operate and comfy!",
