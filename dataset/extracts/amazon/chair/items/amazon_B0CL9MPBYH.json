                "reviewText": "I do have mixed feelings about this chair so here's my first thought I love love love love this chair the looks are quite elegant but also very Charming I adore everything about it except I can't finish putting it together because the screws are not quite long enough, I measured it and four centimeters that's it. you put this much money into a product you expect the right sized hardware, I am so frustrated, I really needed this chair I rent a room and sitting on my bed is kicking my ass. I hate bitching about products but that's what not to take this thing together gave me so much anxiety, I literally cried with disappointment so I'm going to figure something out I'm going to have to go down and buy four screws and I shouldn't have to do that, if you happen to get this product and your screws fit that is awesome and hopefully I can get it aligned.I really don't like design. so honestly once I get this figured out I'm hoping the chair will be as comfortable as it looks I love the little pillow that came with I'll come back with some photos of the finished result, and I believe it's going to be a fantastic chair and I still think it is worth it",
