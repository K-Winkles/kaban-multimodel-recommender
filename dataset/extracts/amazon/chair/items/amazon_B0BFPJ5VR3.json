                "reviewText": "We planned to travel from one state to another on a road trip. That\u2019s almost 24 hours. Although our vehicle has a lumbar support, I still have leg and back pains after a long drive.Before we hit on a long trip, I found this product on Amazon. It is a set consisting of (1) buttocks support and (2) back support (that\u2019s how I described them lol).They are made of thick memory foam. Almost like 2-3 inches thick. It is so firm that even if you put 20 pounds of weight in it, it will stay in its shape. Its case is made of soft spandex that you can remove just by unzipping it and you can wash it anytime.I love how the structure of the buttocks support fits the way you sit and extends to your thighs. It gives you that airflow no matter how long you are sitting.The back support also has a soft case that you can unzip and wash. It has two adjustable straps that you can wrap around and buckle to your driver's seat.The only problem with the back support is when you buckle it, it won\u2019t lie firmly from your seat.To get the most out of this set, I move the butt support a little forward before I sit, then place the back support (unbuckled) at the center of the backrest as I lean back. But, most of the time, I do not use the backrest foam support.I can tell you...After that long drive, I only felt 1% of the pain. I can drive the whole day with this set.If you\u2019re at the age where you feel that pain in your legs and back while you drive... then this set is a must!It is one of the best investments that you can have.",
