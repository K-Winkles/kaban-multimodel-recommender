                "reviewText": "This chair was easy to assemble and is a super cute color. More importantly, it is supportive and comfortable chair!I am a pretty short woman (5\u20191\u201d), and I ALWAYS have issues with desk chairs because the seat of every chair I\u2019ve ever had is too long. I usually have to sit closer to the front of the seat and can\u2019t actually use the back of the chair for support since it is too far back. Ergonomically that is not great, and the ergonomics of my chair are super important to me because I work from home and am usually seated all day.But with this chair all my problems have been solved! The seat of the chair is a bit on the shorter side length-wise so I am able to sit comfortably with with my butt all the way back in the chair where it should be without my legs awkwardly dangling off the edge of the seat at a weird angle like with all my previous chairs. The adjustable lumbar support built into the back of the chair works well. My one problem with the chair is the fabric used. It is kind of uncomfortable on your arms if you use the arm rests. The fabric feels kind of rough and scratchy. I just fold the arm rests up and don\u2019t use them or wear a long sleeve shirt and it solves the issue.Overall, I highly recommend this chair if you are on the shorter side. But you may want to consider getting some sort of cover for the arm rests if you plan on using them all the time!",

                "reviewText": "This chair comes broken down inside a manageable size/weight box. Perfect for apartment folks with a mailroom set up. Pros are easy quick set up, chair frame seems generally well made, decent looking design (i have the white/black looks cool), movable arm rests, sized well for a small work space. Cons are no seat back tilt feature (chair does raise /lower), *Edit- I lied it does tilt I had installed the center post handle wampus*, some rocking felt in the stem, seat pad and arm rest soft touch materials feel cheap-are uncomfortable on exposed skin like forearms or back of legs, and seat pad is not deep enough for longer legs. If you're close to 6 ft tall or have longer legs, say 34 inseam and above you'll feel a lack of leg support. It has a movable lumbar component on the seat back as well. Overall for the price point feels like a good chair for a remote working application. I think This would also fit nicely size wise in a Class B rv if you're a remote working nomad",
