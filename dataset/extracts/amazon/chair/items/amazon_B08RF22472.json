                "reviewText": "I was going to get one of the cheaper $72 models, 6 months earlier. But they had a stock out, during peak of pandemic. When I went back to order one, I noticed this one was $20 more, but looked more substantial. And reviews were better. So I ordered it. Arrived fairly soon. Assembly was a bit detailed, even for a former bench mechanic like me. But the instructions were fairly clear, and very specific, in sequence, with good illustrations. Not only is it very stable and sturdy, it also has some space between the two hip/thigh pads. That is a big plus, for an adult male. The cushions are thick and firm but flexible. The parts all fit together with excellent tolerances. On other assembly-required equipment in past, I often encounter inscrutible instructions or impossible diagrams, or missing parts. But this one was perfect. Five stars. And it helps my back a lot. I don't have back problems but this will help prevent them from developing. Most guys my age do have or develop back problems. I'm 5'7\" and 150 lbs. This equipment is a fine fit for me. Estimate it would work for a person down to about 5'0\" and up to about 6' 0\". Might work beyond that, but I wouldn't know.",

                "reviewText": "It arrived today and it took about 1/2 to unbox and assemble. All the parts were there, and it included two wrenches needed to tighten the bolts and nuts. The assembly instructions were reasonably good and how it goes together is rather intuitive. I wanted this bench because my lower back needs work and I already have a \"regular\" weight bench for my other needs. This makes a good one-trick-pony that is not too expensive. It is light, reasonably compact, and easy to move. I am 5'9\" with a 32\" inseam and the bench needs the lowest/shortest setting. If you have short legs this bench may prove a challenge. (The 2 locking knobs my still prove adequate even though the main one does not slide into a provided hole... but I did not need to try that. Or you could add another hole with a drill and metal bit.)",

                "reviewText": "This bench is pretty stable. I am 5'11\" and 187 lbs. I purchased it for the sole purpose of strengthening my lower back to see if I can remediate some minor discomfort I have been having as I got older. The bench came in a well padded medium sized box. Instructions were pretty clear and comes with 2 wrenches and all the bolts to assemble it properly. Fairly easy to put together and once adjusted to fit your body size, it provides solid support for back exercises. I am sure this can accommodate a person that is over 6' feet tall without any issues. I have not tried any other hyperextension bench, but if you only want to strengthen your lower back muscles, this is a good bench. I keep my bench in the garage and plan to use it regularly so I cannot speak as to how easy it is to put together.",

I'm 64, and plan on using this to strengthen my back, glutes and ab muscles. Along with my step glider, weights, yoga matt and out door activities I hope to get back in shape this summer.
