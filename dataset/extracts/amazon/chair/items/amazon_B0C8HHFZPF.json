                "reviewText": "We were the dummies that bought a cream colored couch and sofa set before we had kids...we needed something that would cover the cheeto finger rake marks and juice stained dots. We wanted something #1 washable #2 easy off and on, but would stay on for daily use #3 something that was cheap, but didn't look it #4 coordinating so that both the sofa and couch would matchAfter a difficult time tugging and tethering we got the covers on, but after a day things just looked frumpy. On reading another review we decided to swap the pieces we had on the feet with the back- tada, looks great and no tugging. We didn't need to use the white ties on our sofa or couch once we put it on correctly. So before you return this thinking it is not a good fit, try a different fit. The fabric is very stretchy and forgiving but isn't shiny. The entire edge has elastic around the perimeter of every piece, so no matter how wonky of a material or shape you have, it should fit. And if you have a back corner creeping up either use a staple gun to the underside or just put the couch next to a wall.",

But if you have a leather recliner it just slips right off\u2026.. the color looks purple and I ordered brown. The color is horrible. I need them terribly to hide the recliner's I have because they are hideous or I would\u2019ve returned them. I\u2019ll order a different brand when I get the chance.
