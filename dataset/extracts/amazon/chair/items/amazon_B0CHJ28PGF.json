Would need to be on a carpet or you would need something to put on the feet of the chair because they will scratch your flooring. These were very easy to assemble. The hardest part was taking the excessive and wasteful amount of packing material off the parts. Highly recommend that someone with pets choose a different chair. My cats really like them: within 48 hours they were covered in fur and were being used as a scratching post. The did not give these chairs a five because they are wobbly and feel unstable. It makes me nervous to let my nana sit in these chairs.",

I reached out to the product customer service to get a replacement for the damaged chair. They told me to iron it to fix it. That made no sense, so I told them it\u2019s still damaged. They then said they couldn\u2019t help because the chairs are sold out, but they\u2019d give me a free trial for a different product. The chairs are still in stock on Amazon though. I\u2019d just order a new set to replace these, but decided to go with a different set of chairs because of the customer service experience.",
