                "reviewText": "I have been wanting one of these for my home gym for quite a while. Black Friday deal was too good to pass up. Here's my review:Pros1. Pretty easy to assemble.2. Great workout, both hyper extensions and ab work.3. The angle of the bench is great. It allows one to be at a 90 degree angle when hanging down to get the most out of the exercise for experienced gym rats. 4. It has nice padded legs.5. It's not to heavy to move around.6. All in all for the price it is pretty solid.Cons1. It took a long time to arrive... about 3 weeks, which is half what Amazon estimated.2. It is a bit challenging to get on to it. At 5'6\" it requires jumping up onto it or using a small stool tucked on one side. That's a bit of a challenge as there is not much space between the pad and the foot holder to swing forward. I might be a bit gun shy leaning on the handles as I saw some reviews saying the handles broke. My handles look welded well. Over time I am sure I will adapt to it.3. While it was easy to assemble, it requires two wrenches that were not included. It would have been nice if they included those little hand wrench tools that come with a lot of things that need assembly. I will have to borrow one from a neighbor as I only have one to finish tightening the bolts on the bottom. They require one to hold the bolt in place while the other one is turning the nut. When tight, the unit is stable. If the bolts are not tight enough it wobbles a little.All in all, I am happy and look forward to using it every day! It's solid for home gym equipment and well padded. Worth it!",

                "reviewText": "Review coming from 6 ft 200 lb weightlifter (25 years still going). Best concept about this bench is that you can lay parallel to ground (rotate perpendiculr to gravity). This product is 5 stars if your just shorter than me, at 6 ft adding weight to the lift might tip the bench over. Marcy needs to make this bench in Pro brand which is bigger products and includes leather pads. In summary this product gets 4 stars for limited use due to small dimensions and foam pads. Great deal for price and quality, but kind of limited to people 6 ft and under.",

                "reviewText": "Original packaging box arrived in excellent condition via UPS, secured with 3 plastic fiber straps. Upon opening, you will find the individual metal frame pieces are packaged in thin plastic bags, with foam sheeting surrounding those pieces with \"sharp\" edges. Some bolts were scattered in the box. The \"brittle\" plastic they use to shrink wrap the bolts and washers to a piece of cardboard was torn, apparently from movement during shipping. No big deal, all the parts were there. The cardboard IS printed with the description of the bolts and washers, which is a plus, and match the included instruction/assembly manual. One of the frame pieces was scratched up from movement during shipping, oh well. The bench is VERY easy to assemble using a common 1/2\" ratchet with 2 different sizes of Standard sockets, and the INCLUDED Allen wrench that is wrapped with the assembly hardware. I assembled the bench in 20 minutes after opening the box. The instructions are clear, and there are not that many parts to deal with. Any adult, male or female, with the proper ratchet set, will be able to assemble this in at least 1/2 hour, no problem. I found the quality of the bench to be excellent. It is sturdy and very stable, and the dark gray powder coat finish is attractive. The 2 foam leg holders are easily adjustable on the frame for different size individuals. Whether you are working the back or abs, the bench is comfortable and very stable. I am 6' and 190lbs, and find the bench to be very stable during exercises. I must admit I was skeptical at first, but am now convinced I made an excellent purchase. The bench is made by Impex, the same company that manufactured my Marcy Smith System weight machine. You will be very pleased with this addition to your weight room, don't hesitate to pick one up at this price. I am very pleased, and expect to get many years use out of this quality bench! Get off the coach and work out!! You'll be glad you did!",

I hummed and hawed and was worried it wouldn't work for me, or I'd be too short...I don't know what everyone is talking about? I'm 5'4 and a half, it fits MORE than perfect to do extensions, sit ups, work my glutes, and it would work for someone even shorter than me NO PROBLEM! Maybe 4'8 to 5 foot one \"might have a problem?\" But 5,2 and up shouldn't be having issues those of you who are, Obviously are not using it right? It's actually bigger than I thought, it's quite nice! The padding seems fine for me, another thing people are complaining about, sure this exercise is an uncomfortable exercise no matter what!!! So I doubt more padding would help, seems sufficient to me? Yes it does rock a tiny bit...I put it on the exercise matting I have in my basement gym and that limited the rocking more, it's still stable, I haven't worked up to using weights with it, but I tried with a 15 pound plate just to see if there would be any issue, and there was none, I'm sure I could use a 25 lb plate no problem. (When I'm ready lol) my abs are still hurting from doing sit ups 3-4 days ago! Brutal! But I love it! Definitely worth the money, definitely a good piece of equipment to invest in. Was fairly easy to put to together, my husband had it done in no time. Stop thinking about it and just do it, you'll be happy you did, you just can't go wrong with this price? You can't expect gym quality equipment at this cost, but this is the next best thing.",
