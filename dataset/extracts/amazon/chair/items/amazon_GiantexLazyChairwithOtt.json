I ordered this inexpensive chair to put in a small spot next to a piano. It comes in a box, is easy to assemble and disassemble, and is inexpensive. IT WAS THE FAVORITE SEAT FOR EVERYONE!! The smallest person (5\u2019) up to the largest (6\u20194\u201d) found it to be VERY comfortable! I mistakenly thought the cover could be removed and washed (hence the beige color) so keep that in mind. This chair looks good and is very comfy, especially with the ottoman. EXCELLENT PURCHASE!!! I thought that with so many positive reviews and free return option, it was worth a try. DEFINITELY A GOOD CHOICE! I have already gotten my money\u2019s worth after only a week! HAH, just realized when I read the product description that it has a cell phone pocket on the side! Fits my phone in its leather case easy peasy.",

This is a perfect light-use chair. It looks nice, and is VERY comfortable. It was easy to put together. The one con for me is that it feels a little \"rickety\" if you wiggle in it, but looking at how it is assembled, it doesn't seem like it could actually collapse. There is a stabilizing cross bar underneath that doesn't screw in, so I added some zip ties to keep it in place. If I had more room, I would definitely get a 2nd one.",

The color is true to its picture.The size is average, but not overly sized.",

                "reviewText": "Do you have kids? Do you have pets? Do you have a need for comfy furniture that won't break the bank and therefore won't upset you too much if the kids and/or pets ruin its pristine upholstery? Then buy these. I'm not kidding, buy these. Between our rather clumsy 10 year old who is prone to spilling anything and everything she touches (and yes, she's been told more than once that nail polish is NOT allowed on the couch!) and our two dogs who make a bee-line for the sofa to clean off their paws whenever it rains, we haven't yet had a couch last longer than three years. They've even managed to take out a pair of wing backs and a fair number of saucer chairs, because of COURSE we didn\u2019t get those to try to keep the kid off the couch. OBVIOUSLY they were meant for the dogs to curl up in at night when we're in bed. After our most recent couch made its way to the curb last week with a lifespan of two and a half years, I decided we weren't going to waste even more money on yet another doomed sofa, at least not until our daughter is old enough that I no longer need to threaten to switch her back to sippy cups and/or I can find a slip cover that actually keeps the smell of wet dog from seeping into the cushions (I have yet to be successful in this endeavor). These chairs seemed cushiony enough not to kill our backs sitting in them and the blue looked like it would match the TV room (it does), so I decided to take a chance on them. And I am very happy that I did. They just arrived this afternoon and I've almost fallen asleep in mine twice already (it's been a long day). The tougher fabric has thus far withstood not only the condensation from my child's water bottle, but my overheated dogs' drool, with the added bonus that both dogs are quite confused by their construction and can't figure out how to get into them. There's no telling how long these will hold up, but even if it's only 6 months they will be well worth the money to give us something to sit on while we look for the next sofa/sectional/loveseat victim to introduce to the TV room. Seriously, if your family is hard on furniture, grab a couple of these. We are very, very pleased.",
