                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Office Chair for the Price!",
                "reviewText": "Admittedly this chair was delivered not even two hours ago, so I can't speak much about its long-term comfort or durability but here is what I can tell you about it:1) The most effortless assembly ever! It took me about 30 minutes to put this chair together but I can't say for sure because I didn't actually time myself and my need for perfectly aligned holes may have lengthened the time significantly. I did it by myself and it was a real snap to do.2) The plastic portions of the chair seem very sturdy and not flimsy like some office chairs I've had in the past. They seem like they will stand up to wear over time but that remains to be seen. The seat cushion is definitely comfier than I expected, it is firm and seems like it can easily snap back into shape after a long day of someone sitting in it.3) The backrest is perfect for me, I have a bad habit of hunching forward because my previous chair had no support or cushioning but then again, I was using a wooden chair. The lower lumbar support is very nice as it keeps me from hunching over at my desk by instead, encouraging me to lean back and give my spine a break. I have the reclining knob set to its furthest capability to help with this.4) This may not be the office chair for tall people or anyone seeking to be higher up but I find it suitable for me. At its highest position, the heels of my feet are less than an inch off the floor and I am only 5'2\" tall, so I guess it will depend on what you are looking for.5) The wheels seem like they will hold up great and while I know this is more of a pet peeve than an actual complaint about the product, I feel it is important people know that this chair DOES NOT move across low-pile carpeting very easily. If you are like me and you have wall-to-wall carpeting you may want to purchase one of those plastic floor mats or replacement wheels designed for carpeting to ensure maximum rolling capability. To me, it doesn't matter at this point because I have no real space or need to roll around in my chair except for pure amusement.6) My only REAL complaint about this office chair is the width. I honestly didn't think to pay attention to this when purchasing. I am a decently hippy woman, as in, I have some pretty damn wide hips and this chair is a little too narrow in the seat for what I would be comfortable with. This is not to say my booty doesn't fit in the chair because it does but oh boy, I can't get much wider than I am right now, or else this chair is going to charity. I measured the shortest distance between the front of the two armrests and they are 17-1/2\" apart so please take that into consideration if you are a curvy woman like me.OVERALL (TLDR), this is a great chair for the price. Easy assembly, the materials appear durable and up to the task of keeping my butt comfortable on a daily basis. The lumbar support is excellent, the height adjustment is perfect as is the recline mechanism. The only two downsides are that the wheels don't glide effortlessly across my carpet and that the armrests are just a little too close for a curvy body type.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this chair and it arrived on time, put it together excitedly b/c I had been without a desk chair for a week or so since my old one had bit the dust and was happy to be back to normal. I had it about two days and one of the castors snapped somewhere on the inside so that the wheel stayed in place but you could no longer put any weight on that particular area or the wheel would not support the chair any longer and you would lean enough to fall out easily if you were not ready to catch yourself. I was well within my return period but did not want to go through the hassle of dismantling, repackaging and sending the chair back, and this was mandatory for both of my return options which were a replacement chair or a refund of my money. So, I reached out to the seller via Amazon with fingers crossed and explained the situation and provided them with some photos of the damage. They responded VERY quickly and agreed to my request to just send me a replacement castor so I could replace the broken one. As I had hoped, they did not just send one castor either but a sleeve of five just like you receive when you purchase a chair initially. They also shipped them out quickly and provided me with tracking information. So with minimal back and forth they were very helpful and efficient with correcting my issue, I appreciate their customer service very much. The chair itself is exactly what you would expect from a $40 chair, it could be more comfortable and ergonomic and this and that but it is now stable, provides decent back support and raises/lowers easily. Plus, I have four extra wheels now in case the overall quality of them proves to be an ongoing issues. I have had the chair over a month now though since I received the replacement wheels and have had no further issues whatsoever.",

                "reviewText": "Seat is advertised as 20\"x20\" but actually measures 19.25\" wide and just 18.5\" where the armrests connect, and the armrests angle inward to only 16.75\" apart at their top edges. Our intended main user of this chair is 5'10\", 215 lbs, and his thighs press against the armrests. It cannot be assembled sans armrests as they structurally support the back.The lumbar supports are good but low, being most pronounced at 3\" to 5\" above the seat, and make contact at the top of the hips if you try to sit back in the seat. The seatback slopes rearwards and makes basically no contact with you at points above the lumbar area unless you arch way back.The seat is firm and not very thick, and the recline tension can be increased just enough for a person of this weight. Recline can be locked only in the full upright position, and even when locked the chair still rocks back an inch or so.Seat height adjusts from about 17.5\" to about 21\". Materials overall are attractive; arms and back frame are a matte textured plastic which feels like it'll scratch easy. The fabric is a medium red that's bright without being garish.Assembly is easy if you pay attention to the three different screw lengths and make sure to use each one where it's called for.Overall an attractive lightweight office chair probably quite suitable for a smaller person. Not a chair for wide-bottomed manspreaders. Should not be represented as especially ergonomic or larger than average.",
