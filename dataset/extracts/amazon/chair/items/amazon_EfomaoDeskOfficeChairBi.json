                "reviewText": "This chair is seriously comfortable. It comes with a pillow for your lumbar support and the hand rests are lower than other chairs which is really nice. The chair can lay almost all the back and there is a foot rest extender, perfect for taking naps during lunch at break. This chair definitely works better if you are not sitting at a desk upright all day but one you can lounge back in. The color is spectacular and goes with everything (I got the grey). And I love the soft leather feel. The armrests are removable if you are sitting at a desk (how I have mine). It also goes up and down (height) very easily and rolls nicely with 5 wheels. Additionally, it has a wide seat so I can sit cross-legged with no issues. The installation was fairly easy and took me about 30 minutes or less to do by my self. The instructions and parts were laid out well. The chair was packaged nicely and secure. Overall a great product. I did have to use customer service and they were prompt, friendly, and very accommodating.",

                "reviewText": "Update** The company reached out to help me with the seat cushion issue and was really great to work with! They were very responsive and i appreciate their customer service.All in all I think it's a great quality, wide seating and I feel it will last. I am still using this chair daily for work and it already seems to be a better quality then most chairs I've tried in the past.Original review** I was super excited to get this chair. It took over a month to receive. Nice material and the great is almost a beige grey. Which I like. The cushion is where I was disappointed. It is not soft, actually fairly hard considering it looks very comfortable. I do like how it reclines, and how wide the seat is, I like the back width for comfort or getting comfortable while working from home. But the seat cushion is hard enough that I will need to get something to help with the pressure it is causing. I was really hoping to have a bit more comfort especially paying over $250.00 for it. I thought about returning it but I will give it a little bit more time to see if I can deal with the hardness. If you like a stiff seat then this would be great for you. If you want fluffy and comfort, personally it's not that for me.",

                "reviewText": "Shipped very fast and it is a big heavy box. Be careful handling it if you are elderly or have anything like back issues. You would want a dolly or two capable ppl. to carry it to the place of assembly. I assembled it in less than an hour and was pleased with how well constructed the pieces were and how easy the assembly was. In the picture the black chair is my office chair of 20 years. I was getting tired of the chair shedding its plastic lining and it was very worn out so that was finally enough for me to get a new chair. This chair caught my eye because it looked comfortable unlike those cheap cooky cutter molds they use for all them silly gaming chairs. Also, it had great reviews backing what it was advertising and reviewmeta.com confirmed that the reviews were pretty legit. I do believe it sits up a couple inches higher than your normal office chair on its lowest setting so that might be something to consider, especially if you are not that tall. Perfect for larger people though and ADHD people like me who like to sit in the chair all the wrong ways and play games for long sessions. Really a great bargain at around 250-260, even 300 is a good deal on this chair.",

The seat is wide, the leather quality and cushion is soft. It has superb arm rest and great high back support. It reclines as desired so I can take short breaks and take naps in between. It has smooth wheels which make it easy for me to roll the chair around.It's perfect for people doing regular 8-9 hours work. Overall sturdy and strong chair. I've purchased brown color one and I love it!When I ordered the chair it came with regular cylinder size. However it was a bit high for me according to my height (5'-6\"). The chair didn't slide under the computer desk of height 29-30\". Then I talked to the customer support and they promptly sent me lower cylinder size for free as advertised. Customer support is really helpful and fast to resolve any issues you might have.I would suggest to go for a lower cylinder size if your height is up to 5'-6\". Do not assemble the chair until you are sure about the correct cylinder size. If you assemble the chair and find it's high, then you won't be able to easily dismantle it, and you might end up damaging the chair. So before placing an order, first be sure about which cylinder size you need and request customer support to help you with the correct one.",
