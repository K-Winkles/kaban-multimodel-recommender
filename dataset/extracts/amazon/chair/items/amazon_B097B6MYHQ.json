                "reviewText": "I know this is long, but do yourself a favor and read it before you throw your money away. I've never bought furniture online before, but i really loved this and the fact that it had 4 stars and it said the shipping was $19.99, I took a chance. I was willing to risk 20 bucks in return shipping fee. That was the start of my worst shopping experience EVER.This is so cute and I wanted so much to love it. But no matter how hard I tried I could not overlook the ridiculously poor quality. I don't even know where to start. Maybe the petroleum smell. That's what hits you first and it does NOT get better even after 2 weeks airing out. The padding is so thin and cheap you can feel the frame cut into your lower back when you sit in it. Most uncomfortable chair I ever sat on. The fabric feels almost like vinyl. The picture shows my heel marks in the ottoman a week later. I tried it out-sat in it less than two minutes. The construction is so light, my 2yo grandchild bumped into the ottoman as she walked by it and knocked it right over. she stopped, picked it right back up, and went on her way without any effort. She's 2 and she lifted it with one hand. The materials are so cheap, it does not seem likely it will stand up to normal use for more than a few months. As much as I wanted to keep it, it just was not worth the price. The worst of this nightmare was about to hit.I packed it up for the return. It did not fit in my car, so I had to wait for a friend with a large vehicle to bring it to UPS. First tried the local Staples that has a UPS station inside. They refused the box because it was too big. Next, we went to an actual UPS store in the next town. I thought the shipping would be $19.99 since that was the shipping cost indicated by the seller. Turns out the return shipping costs almost $150! That's the price of the chair. It's almost as if the seller flipped the prices and was hoping the cost of ship would discourage returns. For the life of me, I can't understand the 4 star rating.BTW-Amazon was really helpful in bringing this nightmare to an end.",
