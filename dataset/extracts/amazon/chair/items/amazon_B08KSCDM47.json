This chair has allot of hate for the back support breaking!Ima let you know. it's SOLID. they are breaking it by over tightening screws because they don't read instructions and they are breaking it.The cushion is fine. It's not perfect but it's better then a wood or plastic chair.I'm 6ft 170lbs and I fit fine. If your BIG BONED HAHA prolly not for you.If you just want a good all around chair then buy it! Think I paid 40$?Also little tip for assembly. Put the back together first with the arm rest. Start with the right arm. Put the screws in halfway. Enough to hold it. Then set it upside down and slide the seat in. (Don't screw anything in all the way! If you have to force it you have one side to tight. Instructions are great and took me about 20 mins or so.Don't ruff house with this thing. If your above 225 then look elsewhere. I'm really pushing it at 225. Maybe even 200. Just keep in mind to treat it right. Of you missuse it of course it's not gonna last.I'm happy with it",

Assembly was a breeze - the instructions were clear, and I had it set up in no time. The wheels roll super smoothly, making it easy to move around my desk area.Comfort hasn't been compromised for style; the soft fabric and breathable mesh back are perfect for long days, providing both support and comfort. It feels sturdy and durable - I think this will be a lasting addition to my space.This chair is truly a great value for money and has exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended!",

My last chair hurt my back because there was no lumbar support whatsoever. I appreciate that this chair has adequate support so I can sit longer to play my games!! It fits my tiny room perfectly as well. Not taking up too much space.",

The seat cushion isn't very comfortable. If you get this chair, get insurance/warranty on it.On a brighter side, assembly was easy.
