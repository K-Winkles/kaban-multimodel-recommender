My office is in the dining room, so I wanted it to be tasteful looking. I\u2019m a small-medium person, but I wanted a robust chair that is both lasting and stable for a generally average-sized person.This chair is exactly what I hoped for. It was easy to assemble and feels like sturdy construction. It is very comfortable for long hours of computer work. It rolls and swivels flawlessly. It cleans very easily with a damp cloth. And it is very cute - right after I got it, a whole group of friends discussed (unsolicited) how good looking it is. I love it and recommend it highly.",

That only lasted a few minutes. Don\u2019t hear anymore which is good news.Good points:Color: Exactly what was described and looks goodStitching: Very nice and clean, looks well made and not cheap.Movement: you can swivel and raise it with free roam, no issues or weird noises. It is well designed.Comfort: Perfect for my size and easy to sit on it for many hours! Made the room look nicer also.Overall: long term my feet will be very happy as it raises enough to give them the ability to swing instead of being in contact with the floor. It deserves the 5 stars, also customer service was amazing contacting me to make sure I had a good experience!",

I bought the brown one. This chair is of VERY good quality, the parts are heavy and good quality, nothing flimsy about it. It was so easy to put together! The chair is sturdy. I am 73, average size woman, (150 pounds, 5ft 3in) and my only complaint is the curvature of the seat is little too much for my bottom, not that I have a big bottom, haha. But it is a snug fit, a little tighter than I would like. My other concern is will the fabric hold up? I hope I don't scratch it or scrape the fabric when moving around or crafting. I like that it does NOT have arms on it. It's super comfortable to sit in for crafting and sewing, which is what I'm going to be doing in it. I will also use it for when I am sitting at my computer. All in all, I am very satisfied with this chair. It was definitely worth the price.",
