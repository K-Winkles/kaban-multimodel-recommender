The process was straightforward, and the quality of the chair is excellent, especially considering the price. It fits perfectly in my apartment's built-in office space and functions flawlessly. I highly recommend it if you're seeking a combination of affordability and quality.",

                "reviewText": "From a quality standpoint this is a nice and comfortable chair but I have to say I had a hard time deciding if I should give it a 4 or 5-star review. So, let me go ahead and talk about my thoughts about it.- Packaging: all components were clearly marked and there was enough padding inside the box to protect everything. But, at the same time, the impression I got was that the box was previously opened and repackaged by someone as things were messy inside - even the tape closing the box was not placed in a professional way.- Assembling: it was easy enough to assemble. A tool is included and even extra screws are provided. The manual is also pretty clear, although I feel they could have done a better job in some drawings/diagrams. Still, I feel it should be easy enough for most people.- Quality: the chair looks pretty good, but I have mixed feelings about the hanger. The good news is that you can decide not to use it at all if you don't like it. It's a solid chair.- Comfort & Ergonomics: the chair is comfortable and it offers height and tilt control. Only the back is mesh - the seat is not. Oh, yes you can also adjust the headrest and armrest. I wish there was some lumbar support and better headrest options, but these would probably make it even more expensive. Also, the wheels are OK - but this is standard in most chairs. If you want something really good, you have to buy replacements.- Final Thoughts: it's a good chair and I didn't see any big issue here, but I would be expecting it to be better considering the $180 price tag.",

                "reviewText": "Got this as an upgrade over my old, broken \"gaming\" chair. The kind that looks like a car bucket seat.While I loved that chair when I first got it, I quickly grew to not care for it too much.The seat was too hard, the back had no give, and the \"Lumbar Pillow\" kept moving all over the place.This new one is a lot like my old office chair from work that I could sit in for hours without a problem.It doesn't have a recline function for me to lay down at my desk, but i don't need that, and it rocks back plenty far, and I can lock that position in place and still feel more secure, and more stable that my old chair.The arm rests move up and down, and aren't terribly uncomfortable, but could use with some padding (cheap 3D party accessory that can easily be found on Amazon) but all in all are niceThe head rest takes some getting used to, but at least adjusts to height and angle, so you can find a position that suits you.The wheels are a bit larger than other desk chairs I've used, which lets them roll nice and smooth.The coat hook on the back is a nice addition, though I got it caught in a couple things, so I just took it off. Maybe when I have a bit more space in the office :)",

                "reviewText": "My husband works at home and spends 10 hours a day in his office on the phone, in front of a computer. A comfortable chair while working is a definite must for him. So far, this fits the bill.Assembly was pretty easy. All of the hardware is included with the chair as well as instructions that were 'OK, but could have been better' (according to my husband).Overall, the chair is comfortable and the ergonomic design plays a big part in that. The mesh backrest provides ample support, the as does the seat cushion which is softer than it appears. Its easy to adjust the chair's height and angles. (There is even a tilt function -had to laugh at the description above because it points out the tilt function allows you to take a nap in your chair during the work day. lol) Holds up to 250lbs.The chair is on wheels and can be rolled around easily. (Ours is on plastic to protect the carpet...rolls without issue)No price is showing on the listing so I cannot comment as to whether the price is reasonable. But I can tell you this is a comfy chair that is very sturdy, easy to adjust and pretty easy to assemble.",
