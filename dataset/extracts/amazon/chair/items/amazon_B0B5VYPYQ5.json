I thought it would be easy to order a replacement but quickly found out it wasn't. Graco didn't sell replacement cushions. Options on Etsy were insanely expensive (defeating the point of buying a second-hand high chair) and a lot of other options I was finding were really cheap. This was the best one I could find, but I couldn't find anything definitive that said whether this would fit the Graco or not. But it fits perfectly! The material is actually better in my opinion than the original because it looks easy to wipe down. Baby isn't here yet so I don't know about durability but I am happy with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I'm always a bit hesitant when products are described as a universal fit, but this one did the trick. The material itself is soft enough for my baby to sit in, however, it is lacking a little in padding - but I guess it depends on how picky you are. The material is easy to clean with a wet cloth, the fit is snug on my Greco high chair, the elastic and the ties on the back keep it in place. I'm quite satisfied and recommend it.",

The original chair replace cover is too expensive to purchase, other generic versions are made with cotton which always requires cleaning.This cover fits perfectly on the chair and easy to be removed for cleaning. Water proof service is baby and child friendly. Note that it is to be used over the old chair cover as it doesn't cover the whole chair. But it covers the majority of the area.Highly recommends it for the quality and price.",
