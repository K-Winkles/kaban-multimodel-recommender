Easy to put together, height is just enough for me (5ft6in), quite comfortable.The fixed upright position is perfect, but the lean-back feature makes no sense as lever is sloppy. The height adjust cylinder seems feeble, and starts to gradually slide down (I'm only 140pds) so we will see how well it holds up. But for what it costs, still a good buy, but I wish I had spent more on a better unit. Rolls around nice and easy.",

Height of the arms was important as I need to slide the chair under the keyboard shelf when not in use, and it needed to be high enough when raised to allow for comfortable seating. This chair accomplishes both goals. The arms are 24 3/4\" from the floor in the lowest position and slightly less the 28\" from the floor in the highest position. The seat and backrest are supportive, not too hard and not too soft, and the seat can be adjusted for tilting. My wife and I both think the chair is perfect for our use.",
