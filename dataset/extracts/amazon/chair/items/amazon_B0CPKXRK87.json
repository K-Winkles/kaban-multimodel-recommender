                "reviewText": "I have been eyeing the criss cross desk chairs for a bit of time now after seeing them trending on social media. I finally decided to pull the trigger, and honestly I don't know why I didn't get one sooner. It took me about 15 minutes to assemble by myself, and it seems very sturdy. I personally didnt want a rolling chair, so this style works great for my hardwood floors and children running around. This is ideal for work from home people, which I do! The chair is stylish, and I love the neutral color and linen material. Overall, the chair is very comfortable, swivels, and I love that I can freely move around while working. The chair can be adjusted depending on the height of the desk and has a nice padded seat. I am curious to see how the seat will hold up over time. So far, I am extremely impressed. This is such a great addition to my workspace. Highly recommend to others!",

The seat and backrest are very wide but fit well under my 31\u201d wide desk. Assembly took a while and needed strong hands to complete. Overall, matches the price point well.",
