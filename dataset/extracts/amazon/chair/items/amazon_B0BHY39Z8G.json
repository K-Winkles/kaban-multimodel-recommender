                "reviewText": "This chair is sturdy (I am overweight) and the seat is comfortable to me. It has a slight, soft cushion effect. It looks nice in our Den and is an asset to my decor. The only con is it is hard to put together. The directions are not too precise. My husband read other comments to learn the peculiarities about putting it together. Since I am writing the review, he is not here to tell me how, but he did read other comments before putting it together successfully. I love this chair and the price!!! Thanks Amazon!!!",

                "reviewText": "The color of this sofa chair is a vibrant color somewhere between navy and teal. Fabric is densely woven and on the smoother side. First impression of cushion is that it is not plush, it is definitely on the firm side with the slightest bounce. Arm rests are slightly padded so thankfully no hardness of the wood is felt. The arm rests are quite low so my forearms couldn't rest naturally. Backrest is also slightly padded but still firm. Seat area is a good size for the average sized man/woman. Not quite large enough to be comfortable long term for bigger folks. Overall it's a very nice looking chair that's comfortable enough for everyday use and guests, but not the most comfortable for lounging and sleeping on.",
