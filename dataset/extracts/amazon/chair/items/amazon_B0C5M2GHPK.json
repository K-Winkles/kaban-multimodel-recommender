                "reviewText": "I have had it for about a week now and it has been an amazing piece of furniture in my house. The color is deep and rich. The texture is velvety smooth to the touch. The padded seat and backrest provide excellent support. I am not gonna lie. It almost feels like you are sinking into the chair. The ergonomic design ensures that you can sit back and relax without any discomfort. The design on the back adds the stylish effect to the total look.Construction-wise, the chair is solid and sturdy. The wooden legs have a rich espresso finish that beautifully complements the green velvet. Assembly was a breeze, and all the necessary tools were included. You should be able to put the screws in the threads using hand only and tighten them up with the Allen wrench. You can even tighten or loosen the screws at the tips of the wooden legs (pre-screwed) to adjust the height or balance it. The assembly time was about 10 minutes, and only took one person to finish the whole process.What impressed me the most, however, was the versatility of this chair. While it is undoubtedly a stunning addition to a formal dining setting in your dining room or kitchen, it is just as suitable for various spaces. I have placed one in my home office as an accent chair, and it has become my favorite spot for relaxing and reading. Overall, it is a great item for multiple purposes that fits various settings.",
