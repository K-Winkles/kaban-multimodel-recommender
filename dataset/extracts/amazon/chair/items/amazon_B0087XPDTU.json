Got her this for Christmas and I know she\u2019s going to love it since observing her recent undying love for Minnie Mouse. \u2764\ufe0f The reviews scared me at first regarding the assembly but it took about 20min for me to put together and was super easy. They even included extra screws. I do wish the cup holder was a bit bigger and that the unit had a back piece for the storage compartment so the drawer doesn\u2019t slide out through the back \u2026 but everything else is great! Quality is amazing! MUST BUY!",

The surface is smooth and can be easily wiped down. The cup holder is perfect and will hold a sippy cup and it won't tip over. We'll worth the money. I will buy from this seller again.",

It was super simple to put together, and pretty durable. She likes pulling the little toy tray out and putting her things away! It's easy to wipe down and clean!",

Despite what other reviewers have said, I did not think it was hard to put together. I am an older grandmother and I did it by myself in less than 2 hours. It\u2019s not a job to rush through with power tools. All you need is two screwdrivers. The directions are clear if you use them from the beginning and follow the steps. Everything fits together beautifully and if you have to force it, you probably aren\u2019t using the correct part or you don\u2019t have things aligned correctly. That makes it easy to put together correctly. It\u2019s thoughtfully constructed, very sturdy, and the finish is beautiful and durable. I believe my grandchildren will use this desk for many years.",

It\u2019s great quality too, so I know it will last for a long time The only I wish is the back of it went all the way down so the drawer wouldn\u2019t be able to come out the back.
