                "reviewText": "Imagine you're a gamer and about 3 years ago you spent $300 on a chair and now it's broken and you need to replace it, but no way you're paying $300 for a chair again right? You just want something comfortable that will do the job but cheaper. This review is for you.From the time I pulled it inside to the time I was sitting in it took about 35 minutes. This included time I spent throwing the ball for my dog because he was confused why I was in the floor and checking in on funny moments during Seinfeld re-runs. Assembly was pretty straight forward and should be simple for anyone that knows how to read and comprehend instructions. There was one moment where I could imagine if you aren't very strong you may struggle lining the back piece up with the seat and getting the screws in properly so you may need some very brief assistance.Now that it's assembled, how does it compare to my $300 gaming chair? Overall it's comfortable, but I feel like I'm too big for the chair. I'm 5'11 about 205 lbs. Pretty average build. The arm rests are in perfect position. My arms rest nicely without having to adjust much at all. I feel too big for the chair for only 1 reason. The actual seat itself is pretty short. I wish it was another 3 to 4 inches longer. The seat ends mid thigh and I wish it ended just behind the fold of the back of my knees. You can recline the back just a bit to make up for this, but overall that's the only draw back.Overall I think it's great for the price and definitely satisfies my need. Good luck!",

                "reviewText": "So I bought this chair in October of 2020 and have not put 6 months into this chair as my everyday work chair. So this review is more than a fresh and shiny, out-of-the-box, first impressions review.Build Quality:Pros: The butt pad is ok and the back mesh isn't terrible... that's about it.Cons: I'll start from the bottom and work my way up here.*The post is not square to the wheels so the plain of the chair is not parallel to the plane of the floor. This makes the chair feel like it is leaning in a direction depending on the orientation of the wheels.*The butt part of the chair is slightly leaned forward but not much, just enough to be uncomfortable over time. Compounded with the out of square post this can make it feel like you are hunched forward with all your weight on the backs of your knees if the wheels are in the wrong direction.*The adjustable arms have a different number of settings on each side and they are not aligned so the two arms cannot be set to the same height.*The reclining feature does not grab well so after you adjust it to any position and lean back it makes a horrendous loud pop before it grabs the back and stops the movement.*The post that holds the back will bend if I lean back because it is just a pipe that is flatted at one end and welded to the plate that attaches to the back so the flatted end just bends easily. Just a stupid design in every way.*Of the 4 threaded inserts in the back panel 3 of them pulled out after a month or two just from moving around in the chair. Mine is now just epoxied to the back panel's post because I spent a bunch of money on a chair and it is too late to send it back.*The back post is slightly out of perpendicular to the base (or the post is slightly bent) so the back feels tilted to the right.Comfort:Pros: None. The build quality has ensured that nothing is aligned properly.Durability: Because I didn't really recline it at all or I didn't notice the weak back post until it was too late to return. If I had I would have returned it before the threaded inserts started coming out by week 5. The popping in the reclining function is slowly getting worse but I am not terribly afraid it will fail because I doubt the bending back post will outlast it.TLDR: I wish I had spent my money on another chair. Learn from my mistake. This chair is garbage.",

Comfortable and feels tough enough!I was surprised by how nice it looked in person too.Cons:- I know it\u2019s not labeled as reclining, but I feel like it sits too straight up, and the back doesn\u2019t have much travel.- At 6\u2019 1\u201d the headrest is useless. At the tallest setting it becomes very flimsy, and offers no support. However my 5\u2019 girlfriend find it very comfortable when adjusted to her.Overall totally think it\u2019s worth it, though I\u2019ll probably try to find a taller aftermarket headrest!",

I am 165cm tall and even lowered to the max this chair is too tall for me, my feet barely stand fully on the floor, hence the back support is pointless, because my posture is not right.2. The arms of the chair are different height as well - it's noticeable when readjusting them to fit over or under the tabletop.3. It also came with stains on the plastic parts of the frame and paint scratched off the metal parts. Don't know if it's a manufacturer's defect or damage from shipping.So overall the chair is not a good fit for me.
