Sitting feels amazing, no more back discomfort or neck discomfort with the built in ergonomic back and head rest, everything is adjustable and it\u2019s very sturdy and made of high quality plastic and mesh.

                "reviewText": "Like everything I buy that I plan on keeping a long time, I researched the blank out of office chairs under $200. I would have gone over budget if I thought there was one better based on reviews and video reviews, features and price. I don't have very much experience with office chairs, so I let others with supposed experience and knowledge help me make a choice. Also, I think spending over $399 on a home office chair is quite possibly the definition of foolishness. So, with that out of the way, I find this chair to have mostly quality components. The most notable exception are the wheels which are a hard plastic which are horrible on our brick floors, so I replaced them with the \"original rollerblade style office chair casters from Oasis\". Those wheels are great and they fixed the wheel complaint for an additional thirty bucks. The seat is firm, which is great, but it isn't really ergonomic i.e. it lacks form, but it is wide and comfortable - I'm 6' and 210 pounds and over sixty. The multiple adjustments were a big selling point for me. They all work fine and feel like they will last. I especially wanted the adjustment that allows the seat to slide forward and back which isn't available on most office chairs in this price range, and it works fine. I was also hesitant to purchase a chair without at least a 300 pound rating because I would assume anything less would be cheaply made, and this chair feels solid and supportive. Assembly instructions are great, but it isn't real easy to accomplish without an extra set of hands, so keep that in mind. Given my lack of experience with office chairs, how can I give it an accurate rating? I think four stars is fair, but if it came with rollerblade style wheels (come on Colamy, better wheels wouldn't add much to the cost) and the seat was more ergonomic, I'm sure it would be a five star chair in all reviews. I made my choice, and now I'll live (not too unhappily) with it.",

                "reviewText": "I replaced a 6 year old Staples chair that began failing with this model. I was looking for adjustable lumbar, harms, swivel, tilt and height change. The foot and head rests were a bonus. It game quicker than first communicated. It was packed well. Directions for assembly were sufficient and the online video was also very good. The marking to note the front of the seat control attachment was hard to ready, but with some more lighting we figured out which end was the 'front' . The word front is on one end, but there is a small arrow pointed to the other end of the control, which is the real front. Easy to assemble. 10 nuts. At first I could not adjust the lumbar. I search through the other reviews and found that using an Allen wrench not supplied, I loosened the screws on the inside of the lumbar handle mechanism and it works great. The directions failed to mention lumbar support movement at all in the three page booklet that came in the box. The provided Allen wrench tool worked well, but could be used for the lumbar adjustment. I can now move the lumbar up and down without tools and it locks into place fine. I'm 5' 8\", a large gal, and this chair is comfortable. I've only used it for 2 10 hours days so far, but really like it at the moment. I love the tilt up arms, never had this on a desk chair before, but I think it will be a space saver when not using the chair. Great for a small home office.",

I reviewed my first chair, however it was damaged, the box was damaged and retapped, and after putting it together it was loose and not stable. I checked all of my work, however the first chair was defective, and it could be due to shipping mishandling. I reached out to amazon chat support, and they were absolutely horrible, they kept asking me for my government issues ID, in order to do anything. Long story short, they gave me a hard time, so I reached out directly to the company, and they made things right. They immediately apologized for amazons horrible service, and they addressed all of my concerns. This company stands behind their product, and treat their customers with respect. They have gained my business, and when im ready to buy more, I will buy form them directly. As far as for the chair, for the price you can't beat the quality, it landed as top office chair in both the Under $200 and $300 category.",
