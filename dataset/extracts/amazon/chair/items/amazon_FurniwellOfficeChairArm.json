Assembly was easy, assembling the seat can be a little tricky if doing it alone due to having to keep the holes aligned and screwing in the screws. Thanks to my daughter I didn\u2019t have to do it alone. Very cute, comfortable and sturdy. Good size for my size 10 butt too! Lol I was gonna be so upset if it wasn\u2019t delivered, but I am soooo glad that it arrived and I love it!! I\u2019ll be buying another two for my daughters. Thank you! ;-)",

                "reviewText": "Ok so I ordered two of these to match with my Roomate and we are OBSESSED! We got the grayish white color and it fits very well with whites and beige colors. The quality is very impressive and I love that the chair is not only on wheels but is also adjustable. The chair itself is very soft and squishy, and the back of it is low but high enough where you can easily sit back comfortably. Size wise it looked wider in the pictures but in reality the sitting part is about the same size as a regular chair if not slightly smaller. It\u2019s also not a very tall chair which is perfect for desks and the adjustability helps with fitting it to your height needs. In terms of assembly it was very easy to put together and screw it all in. The package came with an Allen wrench and all the necessary screws and the directions were super easy to understand! I was hesitant at first because of a lack of reviews but this product is honestly really nice, especially for the price!",
