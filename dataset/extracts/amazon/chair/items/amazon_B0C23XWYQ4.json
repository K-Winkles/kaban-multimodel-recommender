Assembly was fairly easy there were a few steps that were a bit confusing but for the most part was simple to understand. The fabric of this gaming chair is not like other leathery chairs where it's peeling apart within months of being used. The headrest and lumbar pillows are very supportive. I wasn't exactly looking for a footrest within my chair but it's a great added bonus. All and all this chair is really good quality and a really nice chair if your like me and sit at your desk for a long time. Good quality chair for a great price would buy again \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

Make it happenEdit: I'm getting communication from the manufacturer now. Seems like the delay was due to Chinese new year, I've updated my review to 3 stars accordingly",

                "reviewText": "This chair for the price is amazing. It was extremely easy to assemble it and the instructions were straight forward and east to understand. It comes with the only tool you need to build it and it's not cheap either. They provide you with an allen wrench that perfectly works for all of the screws provided. Not to mention that everything is labeled perfectly, and all of the small parts (screws, caps, and nuts) were kept inside of this plastic sealed piece of cardboard. So there is no way for any of the small pieces to get lost, it even had extras!For my first time building a chair it was smooth sailing from start to finish. Not even talking about how comfortable and supportive this chair is as well. The upholstery they used is of a good quality as well and doesn't smell funny either like some do. I have no gripes with the chair, but something that somebody might have a gripe with is the lack of support between the head pillow and the lumbar pillow. Of course if you're buying this style of chair then you would know that, but even then there is plenty of room to stick a small pillow in the space between the two of them if need be.Overall highly recommended",

                "reviewText": "The chair was easy to assemble and put together. However, there is little to no support in the actual cushion in the seat. the back rest of the chair is also pretty hard. I had to remove the lumbar support pillow due to it being extremely uncomfortable. The chair dimensions are also incorrect. the seat was more narrow and short than advertised. Part of the reason I picked this chair was it had a larger seat which in turn, was not the case. Another gripe about the seat of the chair was that the foam seemed to have been cut a little short on one side and instead of cutting a new piece, someone said \"ehhh, good enough\" and closed her up. The recline is nice however im now planning on using it much. This chair does not have a \"rock\" feature so theres no lean. where you put the chair is where it stays. over all, i feel for 140 bucks, this would be good for a kid or someone who will only use it for a short time each day, but a serious gamer or someone who has to sit in this chair for a long time straight might want to look somewhere else and or buy a more expensive chair. its bad enough that im debating going back to my flaky pleather chair and just save up for a different one.UPDATE: After 48 hours I feel as though I've been in a car accident. My hips are hurting, my back is screaming at me, there's no foam support other than what's at the very front of the seat (which does nothing for you). My rear end feels as though I fell down a flight of stairs. Everyone who gave this chair a 5 star rating must have been paid or somehow seeded cause this chair IS NOT comfortable at all. I'm 5'10\" and 250lbs just for reference. You can literally feel the brings through the fabric of the seat like a super cheap mattress that's been used for 20 years. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this particular product.",

While I was putting it together I did get a defected screw but thankfully it comes with 1 extra piece of every piece so I was able to replace it. I did struggle to put an armrest but after a while I was able to get it in well.I am a 5\u20195 130lbs female and it does not feel huge it feel like its perfect for my size. Haven\u2019t gotten to try the leg rest other than to just try it out hut it feels comfortable. Overall great chair and I have no regrets at all for buying the chair feels great.",
