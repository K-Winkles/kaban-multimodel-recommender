                "reviewText": "I bought my new office chair to replace an old one that was falling apart, but also to hopefully correct the tendency of the old one to sink over time. Sadly, this new chair quickly starting showing the same behavior - slowly sinking as I sat in it, requiring me to constantly raise it back up again. I checked for a solution online, and, short of replacing the cylinder, the most common solution was to use a piece of PVC pipe fitted around the cylinder. The trouble with that was, with my chair at least, it would have required disassembling and reassembling chair to get the PVC in place.The Hero Fix was the perfect solution. It's inexpensive and provides set of clamps that easily install around the cylinder without needing to remove it from the chair and can be adjusted to several different heights by mixing the different sized clamps. One deficiency is that you can't combine them in any way to make 4\", but I found that 4 1/4\" works fine for my chair. They feel sturdy and click into place fairly easily. Once you install them the chair height will be fixed to at least the height of the clamps unless you remove and reinstall the clamps in a difference combination, but I always want my chair at its maximum height, so they are a perfect solution for me.",

                "reviewText": "The riser on my office chair was starting to fail, and I was considering purchasing a new chair. When I saw these heavy duty \u201cspacers\u201c, I thought I would give them a try. The package contains several spacers, all of different lengths which I was able to combine to brace the central rod on the chair. Basically, they fill in the gap to keep the riser extended. They clamp around the smaller section of rod, so that the rising mechanism cannot collapse.My chair is in excellent condition aside from the problem with the riser, so I am very happy to not have to buy a new chair for a while longer.",
