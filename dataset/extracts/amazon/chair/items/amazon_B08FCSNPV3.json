                "reviewText": "This is a very comfortable chair. I use it in an area that serves as my living room, game room, exercise, room and VR space. It changes roles by me rearranging the furniture. So, it's essential that this chair be light and easy to lift and move out of the way. It's also very comfortable. The seat pan is not too soft, but still cushiony, and it features a front rail that keeps your fanny from sliding off the pan. The backrest has a good array of positions, and I like the fact that you can click it through the whole range without having to get up. I've had other portable chairs, and I've had to get up, slide the chair clear of any obstructions, and push it forward and ALL the way back to get it to select settings. With this chair, you can lean forward a bit, pull it up and push it back to the full reclined position, easily.It's well constructed, very strong, and the swivel base works smoothly, and is elevated high enough that you can easily swivel and spin if you're using it as a gaming chair.",

The only negative I would say is watch little ones from hanging on the back of the chair. It might break! No assembly needed which is a plus! Just unfold and go gaming!!",

                "reviewText": "Decent chair for my 8yo. Here is the breakdown of pros/cons:Pro(s)Nice looking designHas arm rests (vs most gaming chairs)Comes assembled, folded in the box -- It's as easy as taking it out of the box, and unfolding the backOk priceCon(s)Very low to ground - Great for my petite son but would be uncomfortably low for teen or older.Cheap fabric -- Like the fabric made in a cheap foam costume. No damages or tears to the fabric, but low quality and not particularly comfortable.Alignment very upright and no option to adjust.Overall, not a bad chair and my 8yo likes it. I don't know that I would buy it again, but worth keeping.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this chair for my 9 year old who loves gaming. The chair came already assembled in the box which was a huge plus. It fits my son perfectly and he definitely has room to grow in it. It swivels with ease and also has the option to recline back easily. I was worried that it wouldn't hold up well with frequent reclining but we haven't had any issues thus far. We ordered the red and black, the material is ribbed but soft and offers great support. The arm rests are an added bonus since a lot of gaming chairs don't have the arm rests on them. He sits in this to read as well, can be used for simply lounging if wanted!",
