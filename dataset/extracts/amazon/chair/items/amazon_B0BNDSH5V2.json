I would highly recommend this cover.",

It work really well, my favorite part is that it\u2019s liquid resistant. I have grandchildren who are constantly having little spills, this stops a little spill from becoming a big problem. It has a backing that helps it to really stay out on the chair which is incredibly helpful, as it doesn\u2019t move around when I\u2019m trying to sit or when I\u2019m seated. It has a strap on the back just to assure it stays still. One of my favorite features is the side pocket, where I put my phone and channel turner. The thickness is just right as well, exactly what you would expect in a chair cover. I\u2019m going to get another for my other recliner. I would definitely recommend! It will look great & it\u2019s functional as well!",

IT IS NOT WATERPROOF. I bought this for my husband, who has nerve damage in his neck, which causes him to twitch and convulse so heavily he's drenched in sweat at times. I do feel awful saying my hubby is ruining the furniture, but there it is. So. Picked up this one, because it says it's waterproof. It is not, soaked right through. I would honestly shudder to think this is meant to be used for dogs with bladder issues. Otherwise, it is comfy, and it looks nice.",
