Our back cushion contours around the natural curve of your spine to lessen discomfort, improve your sitting posture, and reduce sitting fatigue. Can chairs cause back pain? Most chairs are designed with a straight back. This leads to you sitting hunched over, causing pressure and pain in your neck, shoulders, back. Adding a lumbar cushion to your chair is an easy, affordable way to upgrade your uncomfortable seat. Are back cushions healthy? If you often have pain in your back, neck, or shoulders, a back pillow can help improve discomfort while sitting. Our back support is designed with premium memory foam to provide a soft, yet firm foundation to support a healthy sitting posture. How to apply this back cushion? Our lumbar support cushion can be placed anywhere on your chair to support your upper, middle, or lower back. Dual adjustable straps ensure it stays in place, even if you shift about. Fits virtually any chair with a maximum width of 32\u201d (81cm). How do you clean the back cushion? Our back support for office chairs features a removable cover that\u2019s easy to clean and keep fresh. Simply unzip the cover from the memory foam, and toss cover into the wash on the gentle cycle. Tumble dry with low heat for best results.",

                "reviewText": "I read all the 5-star reviews on this product with some skepticism, but upon receiving it today via Amazon Prime, I was at once impressed. The build quality seemed decent, and as someone else wrote, this memory foam product is the 'goldilocks' of seat cushions... not too firm and not too soft. The included elastic belt/buckle/extension units reached around my new executive chair quite easily, and I was able to adjust the height of this cushion to maximize pressure on my lower back area and thus my discomfort whilst sitting evaporated. I shot a couple of pics so you can see how well this product works and how it attaches to your existing chair. I'm not sure how this would work in an AUTOMOBILE seat as they are quite thick and wide, I did not try it in my car. Everlasting Comfort did a nice job packaging this in a plastic bag with a moisture wicking pad, instruction sheet, and lifetime warranty registration (online) instructions. I was impressed, as the manufacturer even gives their email address and invites you to immediately contact them if there are any issues or defects, and they will directly send you a replacement! That's outstanding, tells me they have confidence in their product. For the small price, I think this is a worthwhile purchase, and speaking as a person who is now dealing with daily chronic sciatic and lower back pain, I regard this item as a very good purchase decision on my part and recommend anyone in similar circumstances to try it. Given Amazon's liberal return policy, why not? I didn't even take it out of the plastic bag until I sat in my chair a bit and tried it out. Note that in my photos, a secondary chair pad (purchased here on Amazon) is shown where you 'sit' - that item is from a different memory foam manufacturer well known for their mattresses. The chair itself is also from that same famous memory foam manufacturer, but the chair did not support my lower back at all, even trying every conceivable adjustment on the chair. So this cushion was a Godsend. Mark me a happy camper.",

                "reviewText": "This is great lumbar cushion. I agree with some of the reviews that it is a little too thick. I have it on a standard office chair and it seems to push me forward so that it's a bit uncomfortable sitting. My behind doesn't sit clear on the back on my seat and I feel like I'm being pushed forward. However, I moved the cushion up to the very top of the back of my chair and I am able to sit a bit more comfortably and the cushion still makes me arch my back and that is what my goal was. If I were to put the cushion very low, close to the seat, I wouldn't have room to sit on the seat and would only be perched on the edge. The cushion came with an extender which I did not have to use but I appreciated that it had one. Probably good for gaming chairs. I do plan to use this in my car and would most likely use the extender straps. All in all, I recommend this cushion. I do like the fact that I can take the cover off and wash it. It also looks sleek and professional on the back on my chair. Very nice cushion for the price.",
