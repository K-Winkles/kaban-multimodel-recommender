I will keep it because of the price and the comfort. the color and fabric are also very nice.",

It's an upholstered chair, and I take really good care of my purchases, so I will update in a few months if I start having issues, however, it appears to be made very well. Let me add, the color is awesome.",

In my opinion the seat is the perfect firmness.",
