                "reviewText": "So, this basically came without instructions. There was a diagram, but it was minimally helpful. Needless to say, our first attempt at putting this together was very unsuccessful. It seemed pretty straightforward from the diagram, but they left out what we think is probably a crucial step. It looks like they meant to put two red arrows on the top parts of the \"X\" leg setup, but they are very faded and at first we didn't even realize they had a purpose, because they just looked like red marks. But, if we are right, the red \"arrows\" should be facing towards the front of the chair, or pointing towards the front (where you would stand to sit down). It was still a bit difficult getting all the bolts in place, but once you know about the red arrows you should have at least a little easier time with these. Also, before you can attach the legs you have to pull off some gray sticky felt pads - I'm pretty sure those were meant to be taken off and then placed on the bottoms of the feet of the chair so that they don't scratch up your floors. Again, that wasn't in the instructions but I'm assuming that's what they are for. As far as the actual chair goes, they are pretty nice and actually really sturdy. We have some other chairs similar to these and those were not very sturdy, especially for kids. Those chairs tipped over almost any time my kids tries to get in or out of them. These are much better. My kids don't have that same issue with these, so they seem a lot more family friendly. And the plastic of the chairs is pretty thick and durable. These also wipe clean pretty easily. Overall, if you can make it through the assembly I think you'll love the chairs.",
