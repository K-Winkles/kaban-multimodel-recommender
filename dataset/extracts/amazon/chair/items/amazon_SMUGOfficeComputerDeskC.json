                "reviewText": "I like this chair.My old chair is one I rescued from a office park dumpster eight years ago and Ive been using it ever since. Well, it finally broke and I decided to give this one a try. I like it. It's easy to assemble and comes with the tools you need. The feet and wheels are metal, as is the hydraulic piston and the controls. The seat cushion is well padded and feels good to sit in for long office days. I was a little worried about the mesh seat back. I was a bit worried that it might be cheap or thin. Easily torn or ripped. I was wrong to worry. The mesh is sturdy and unless you really try to tear it, it should last a long time.Two things to note.Compared to my old chair, this one is very light. lighter than you would expect when looking at the pics. No real negative to this and can be a positive if you're an older person or have back problems. You won't have trouble lifting or moving this chair.Secondly, I replaced the stock wheels that this chair comes with, with a set of roller blade wheels they make for office chairs. Makes it easier to roll through carpets and they worked fine on my old chair. I'm five foot, ten inches tall and with the new wheels on this chair, my feet can't reach the floor at the chairs lowest setting. So if you are a shorter person, you wont be able to use the after market, roller blade type carpet wheels with this chair. Not the chairs fault, and its the correct height with the wheels the chair comes with.Over all, i'm very happy with this chair.Oh, and great lower back support. I have a very bad back.",

I don't think you can find a better chair at a cheaper price. It is sturdy, the back gives great support and I like that the seat is on the firmer side (not firm enough to where you can only sit for a couple hours).The instructions are very clear, no guess work. And the tool provided is a grade above.Ps. I also bought an electric desk from the same company. Again, great desk for a very good value. Super clear instructions just like chair.",
