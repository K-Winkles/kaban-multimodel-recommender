It\u2019s not a heavy chair, and it\u2019s so much wider than I figured. It\u2019s very comfortable, easy to put together and has plenty of room. I highly recommend.

                "reviewText": "I work from home and this chair has been really nice to use the past month or two. I like to sit with my legs crossed and it's been so nice being able to do that while working. I can't say much about the reclining feature because my back is against a wall, but I like that it swivels making it easy to get up from my desk.My husband really loves the chair and says it has good back support. He's a little on the bigger side so the chair seat being wide and sturdy is amazing. I got the leather beige one because my cat likes to take naps on my chair when I'm not working, and her hair easily comes off. She has stuck her nails in the leather while waking up from a nap and stretching but you can only see the punctures if you look super close.",

                "reviewText": "Definitely a two-person job! I\u2019ve included a photo of the instructions in case anyone gets a chair with no instructions included (happens so often!)So- putting the back and the bottom of the chair together and tightening the 4 screws is the hardest part, because the seat and back are so plush they prevent the holes from lining up. But it can be done. Kneel on the back-piece to depress the foam and hold the seat in place while another person screws in the hardware.Worth the trouble! Very nice.",

This is the most affordable and comfortable desk chair ever! I love the fabric, color, and size. I don\u2019t really like rolling chairs so I prefer that this is just stationary. It spins and leans back so it\u2019s super comfortable to sit in and do work! Highly recommend!",
