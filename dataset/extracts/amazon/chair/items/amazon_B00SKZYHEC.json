                "reviewText": "My daughter is taking an outdoor class, which means the parents wait on the sidelines for 2-3 hours in the boiling, blinding sun. The first day was miserable, then I brought hats and cover-ups, THEN I got this chair. The shade over the chair changed everything. It also took care of my \"sun glare\" headaches that even sunglasses could not prevent. The other parents asked for the information so they could get one, too. The only thing to be aware of is the canopy will catch the wind and knock the chair over pretty easily if it is a breezy day and there is no weight in the chair. As long as someone is sitting in it, no problem. So if you get up to do something, put a heavy bag in the seat or offer it to a friend while you step away. I WOULD PURCHASE THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR ANY OUTSIDE ACTIVITY IN THE HOT SUN.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE, APRIL 2021:I've had this chair for about a year-and-a-half now, out on my patio in Florida. In the sun and the rain and the Heat.I have to admit it's worn in nicely. And even in the intense heat here it's held up pretty well. I use it daily. And it has stretched out some and become quite comfortable.Unfortunately because of the heat here, I am going to have to replace it soon. But that's the cost of canvas chairs in Florida.If you use this chair occasionally, for instance. throw it in your trunk to go to a game, it'll last you years. To see the original review just scroll down. Because yes, it was the most uncomfortable chair for the first few months. But I went back and added two more stars to it because it's become my favorite chair. And I still absolutely love the top!Original review 2019:This is without a doubt THE most uncomfortable chair I've ever sat in. And that includes sitting on the ground. Where to start? First of all, I'm 5'7\", 130 lbs. This is a key piece of information.This chair is not made out of canvas. I have no idea what it is made out of. Something that's pressed to look like canvas but has the give of Steel. The seat is coated underneath with actual plastic. And I'm pretty sure that the material itself is some sort of plastic. It's very very crinkly sounding. The area in the front of the seat, by the knees, is folded over about 4 in for construction purposes. That 4in feels like a steel bar under your legs. And the area between the two poles by your knees are not far enough apart to sit comfortably. Even if you squish your legs together.The poles up by your shoulders hit me right about in the middle of the my shoulder blade. And I do not have broad shoulders.The way the chair is designed, the arms are quite far away from where the seat is. You can't comfortably use them for an elbow rest.There's a warning label advising you not use the cup holders for any hot liquid. Which sort of reinforces my idea that the whole thing is made out of plastic and might melt. I certainly have no reason to believe it will last very long at all in the Florida sun. Even with the umbrella over top. Which by the way is the only cool part of this chair. The fabric of the umbrella seems to be a little softer and have more give, which is weird. Because you would think they would use that for the seats for comfort.The seat itself has no give whatsoever. It's not even like sitting in a shallow steel bowl. It's more uncomfortable than that. . You have to sit with your knees squished together, your shoulders hunched forward and your hands in your lap.The amount they say this chair can hold is something I greatly doubt. Because someone anywhere close to 160 to 200 lbs couldn't even fit in this thing.Also, as if there were not enough reasons to dislike this chair. I'm 5 foot 7 in and if I lean back my feet can't even touch the ground. Who the heck designed this thing? The Spanish Inquisition?OK... so why two stars? Why not one? Because the top is absolutely genius! It bends, it tilts, it folds back, it truly is brilliant. The mechanism of this top, and the genius of the idea of it, combined with a chair made in a way where you could actually sit in it would go for at least double this price. And be worth it.",

                "reviewText": "It is a good quality, easy to fold and unfold. No parts to be attached it all comes in one piece. Use the canopy or not. It is not comfortable due to the placement of the seam between between the back and seat. The seat looks big enough but when you actually sit down you are forced to slide forward making the seat area short. If you are tall or overweight this is not the chair for you. Gives good back support but the short seat is annoying, not for sitting for long term. The bar of the front of the seat causes pressure on the back of my upper legs. The back legs come out of the cups easily so I have to check it before sitting.Safety Warning!!!! The back legs fit into cups built into the frame. If you forget to do this you might have a problem.",

                "reviewText": "These are nice chairs but the canopy portion is very poor quality. The cross arm on both chairs broke and the canopy itself on one chair ripped after only a few uses. The chairs were stored in the provided bag. The chairs are still usable but the quick damage after only a few uses is very disappointing.On the plus side, the chairs are light and easy to setup. The canopy provides good shade and cover from light rain despite breaking easily.",

They are super convenient since the chair has a built in shade. It really helps for those all day soccer tournaments in the sun. The chair is sturdy and easy to fold and unfold. It fits back easily into its carry case. Overall, I would recommend this chair for its convenience and practicality.",
