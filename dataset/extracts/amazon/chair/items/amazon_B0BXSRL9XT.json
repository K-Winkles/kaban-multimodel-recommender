                "reviewText": "Suffering from scoliosis, it's difficult to find a chair that fully supports my curved back. When I saw this, I thought I'd give it a try, but I was hesitant. And I wasn't disappointed with the back support. However, there are a few drawbacks:1) The first three wheels were easy to install; the fourth a little difficult and the fifth was an absolute bear. Husband had to take a heat gun and heat the post and then push it in.2) Per the enclosed diagram, the lever to raise and lower the chair is inaccurate. In order to raise the seat, you need to push down on the lever, then stand up slightly.3) Installing the bolts can be tricky so do exactly what the directions say: Leave them loose until just about everything is installed. This way, you can make any adjustments easier. You might need a second person to help; I managed to do this on my own but I could have had another person helping.4) Yes, the chair back comes in a gray color, no matter what color you order (I ordered beige).Positive comments:The instruction booklet is well laid out with clear diagrams. I got a chuckle out of the reference to not get your hand caught when installing the fifth leg; it created a personal touch.The language is easy to understand.Would I buy another? Sure!",

                "reviewText": "I don't usually write reviews, but I really wanted to for this chair (and a desk I purchased too!).I am building desks and chairs for a new office and I have always hated putting chairs together. Usually you have to balance something on something else just to get the screw holes to line up. The engineering usually seems like it was done by someone that's never actually put furniture together -- but not with this chair.It may not sound like a big deal but the ease of assembly made a big difference for me. They look nice and are comfortable, too. Especially for the price. They don't look or feel like a less-expensive chair. Thank you to the people who make these!!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the white/grey version back in June 2023 due to the good reviews. Although assembly was straightforward, the pieces did not align properly, making it challenging to put the chair together. The chair also was dirty out of the box, indicating it may have been used. I reached out to Neo Chair with images of the dirty sections and they responded very quickly and partially refunded me. Honestly, this chair is pretty good in terms of back support with the lumbar section. The arm and seat cushion are great and I can sit for for hours straight. The wheels and the chair was generally quite squeaky when I moved around, which annoyed me. However, this chair has recently, after 5 months, started to slowly disassemble itself. The chair does not stay at the height that I set it to; after a few hours of sitting on the chair, it would sink to the lowest level. But moreover, the screws are not staying put and three of the screws have fallen out in the last two days, and now the chair is wobbly. For context, I weigh 120 pounds. Honestly, good chair but does not last long.",
