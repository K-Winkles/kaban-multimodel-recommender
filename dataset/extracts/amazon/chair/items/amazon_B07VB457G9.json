                "reviewText": "It came quickly in the mail within four days. it only took us 30 minutes to assemble it and I didn\u2019t even need the instructions - come on it\u2019s a chair with only a few pieces to assemble lol and it was very easy to follow the directions if you needed to refer back. Of course I am kind of a handy guy with tools, but even if you have a little bit of experience you shouldn\u2019t have a problem putting this chair together there\u2019s really not that many pieces to assemble. I\u2019ve seen people write some reviews saying that they took two hours to figure it out and that\u2019s just ridiculous. It\u2019s really comfortable and fun to use. It has a lot of options like recline, extra padding for lumbar support and neck support and it\u2019s, fully adjustable, and very well-made, and most importantly priced fairly. I\u2019ve seen chairs go for way more and this one is just as good.Im going to get another for office at my garage. It\u2019s so sporty looking! I keep seeing people say this thing breaks? Well, I\u2019m 220lbs and five feet eleven and I didn\u2019t break the foot rest like these other people who must be slam dancing in the chair all night lol come on guys this is a 200 dollar middle of the road chair that\u2019s giving you a lot of nice options and features, AND for a fair price! This isn\u2019t a premium office chair you\u2019ll find in a law firm, bank, or executives conference room, those chairs are usually 1000 dollars folks. I\u2019m also buying the matching desk they make too right after I\u2019m done posting this review. Because I\u2019ve bought many office chairs over the years and I\u2019m having the most fun with this one. And yes, this chair is best fitted for certain \u201cframe types\u201d let\u2019s say, but I\u2019m no small guy and I take care of my stuff that I buy and I\u2019m not rough with it. It\u2019s great for gaming for a few hours and he\u2019ll yeah as well as kicking back the recline feature and talking on the phone lol I\u2019m so buying another chair for my office at the garage and a desk too! I wanna look cool over there and this chair screams racing! I don\u2019t care if it lasts only a few years, or maybe it will be last more since I take good care of things, I\u2019m not using it to go on a ship into outer space with the dam thing! I don\u2019t need a five hundred dollar elite brand chair for my every day work. A buddy of mine has the same chair in his garage with a rough edged floor, grease, and chemicals and he\u2019s had his chair a whole year beating on it and it never broke, I don\u2019t know what these people are doing with the chair but they can\u2019t be treating them correctly. So pound for pound and option for option, this was the best deal going. And anyone who says this chair is less then four stars surely doesn\u2019t know what there talking about. I sat on this chair six hours today and the padding and pillows were satisfactory. Of course my leg was a bit sore because heck, nobody should sit for that long on any chair!lol But for the money, and the design, I think this chair is just fine.",

                "reviewText": "After reading the reviews of this chair, I can see where people don't like the instructions. Personally, I don't like how they want you to put the arms on at the end. I saw a lot of complaints at it breaking immediately but I put mine through the tests of reclining and a pressure test on the leg rests. TBH, I really think most of the broken chairs are a result of poor instructions and/or poor user assembly. The chair is comfortable outside of what seems to be a bit of a distance on the arms from the chair even at the closest setting, you do have to remove at least one of your arms from the arm rests in order to type but thats really about it.The leg/foot rest is exactly what it is. Somewhere below I read that theres a fatal flaw on the leg/foot rest but it wasn't clear how they where using it. They made it seem that they tried to stand on it (don't). It's just a leg/foot rest thats it, could it be a bit more comfortable, yeah a little.Overall, the chair is a great piece for it's price. I think a lot of negative reviews are trying to make comparisons to chairs made by Secret Labs or Respawn that are almost $100 more. I'm quite fond of this chair, I've had to go back and fix how I put it together a couple of times but that is because the items aren't marked for inside or outside (arms) or which side of the leg/foot rest should be used. If you're looking for a chair under $200 and has lambar support, this is a good one even for its price. You can adjust the lambar support to where it feels best for you.Ultimately, this is a review so, you decide if you want it.",

                "reviewText": "It was easy enough to assemble, but it was missing a few screws.. I made it work but it was noticeable in the arm rests right away but I made due. Soon later the armrest would swivel causing you to have to pop them in or out which is a strange feature. After only a couple months of use the back adjusting mechanism broke, which i was able to deal with until the back had zero support. It was like a floppy pool noodle either falling forward or backward. This chair wasn't cheap...But the quality of the welding was incredibly cheap.. My partner and I are average height and weight, absolutely no reason for this to fall apart on us so quickly... I threw away the back and have been using my computer stool till i can afford a decent gaming chair....at least the leg rest still works... My cat likes it... I just put a towel on my computer stool >.<Save your money and do your homework.Ive been using it backless longer then having a back on it... It literally pains me to this day..I knew it wasn't gonna last forever but, to start falling apart in a few months is absolutely absurd and frustrating. I honestly felt/ feel helpless with this misfortune purchase...I like(d) the height of it...Stuck with this stool cause I fell a fool u.u",
