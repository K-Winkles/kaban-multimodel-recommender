                "reviewText": "VERY VERY HAPPY THAT I BOUGHT THIS!!!!! I buy one for all the kids in my family,but not this particular design . I usually get the table and chairs,wanted this one because this is for a 2 year old and it\u2019s better because it comes as one piece. I love this set!! If you\u2019re looking for something sturdy that cannot be destroyed by a very busy (bad \ud83d\ude02) toddler this is what you want to get. I am so happy with how sturdy this is,the design on it is lovely and it\u2019s very expensive looking,came with all the parts,easy instructions,a cup holder,very easy to put together and he is going through a Spider-Man phase so he loves it! The one complaint that I have that isn\u2019t a deal breaker is the fact that where the bin goes down at the bottom doesn\u2019t have anything in the back to keep the bin underneath the chair and not pushing all the way through. I\u2019ll get something to pull across the back to keep the bin in and from not going all the way through. The bin (storage) is a nice addition so he can put a few toys and books in it,which he has already done. I\u2019m very happy and so is my nephew! I should also mention that it\u2019s not heavy,but it\u2019s not light either.Also,nothing but a wipe down and it\u2019ll be right back pretty with a nice shine to it!",

I thought this would be small but it\u2019s fairly large my six year old grandson can probably stay in it till he\u2019s eight or so. It\u2019s made out of wood so it\u2019s sturdy. It took a minute to put it together, but it wasn\u2019t really difficult. It\u2019s easy to clean. The picture doesn\u2019t rub off. It will be heavy to constantly move. like for most you can\u2019t just pick it up with one hand. Most people will just pick it up from the desktop. I wouldn\u2019t recommend that because it may get loose overtime so you will have to find a spot to just grab it somewhere where you can just push it or pick it up. It comes with a little cute storage bin under the seat. I am an adult and I can actually fit in the chair myself.",

It\u2019s very important you wash it immediately after use, so that food or drinks don\u2019t get stuck on it. Vibrant colors. It is slightly heavy very sturdy. This is a must have to a child under 3/4 depending on how small your baby is. It also comes with its own cup that\u2019s a plus \ud83c\udf53\ud83e\udd52\ud83c\udf5d",

                "reviewText": "My 20 month old son loves pj masks, he was catboy for Halloween. I decided to get him this for Xmas as he is approaching that next stage in development towards independence. This was literally the best decision I made for a few reasons and I strongly recommend this for moms everywhere and il tell you why ...#1 pick a design your kid will love (my LO loves the pj's) it helps spark curiosity and gets them pumped up about the desk. He keeps going up to it to stare and admire the characters.#2 we started using this in leui of a highchair for every snack or meal as he is more willing to sit down and eat now that he has a little freedom. He really hated being strapped down in the highchair (problems with authority, I get it lol) and he would literally try to rock himself out of the highchair. The desk was the perfect compromise as he makes his own decision to sit down, he has freedom to stand up and take a walk while he chews (since he apparently likes doing this) and then sits back down for another bite. My baby is happy, we are happy and I noticed this new sense of appreciation on his part which is pretty cool. Prob that feeling of accomplishment that he is being treated like a big boy, ya know?! Anyway, def recommend!Only complaint was putting it together, I had to bang the hardware into the prepared holes and it doesn't feel totally secured but somehow once it's all together it feels alright.",
