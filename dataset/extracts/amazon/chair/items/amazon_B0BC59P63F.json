                "reviewText": "This chair has a very wide chair space with room to spare. The arm rests adjust. The seat has a lot of cushion and is very comfortable. It's a heavy chair so the quality in the build is there. It is easy to assemble but again the parts are heavy. It is height adjustable. The only thing is that the back portion of the chair doesn't hug your back. Perhaps because I am 5'4, my back doesn't really touch the back of the chair. However, the strong build of the chair allows me to still have good posture and place a pillow to cushion my back. Otherwise, the chair is great and I am loving the support. It glides on my wooden floors easily and smoothly without damaging the floors. Very comfy!",

                "reviewText": "Update: My original review is listed below (rated 3), as you see, I've changed it to a 5 rating. To my surprise the company reached out to me and offered to replace the chair. In a world where customer support has all but been forgotten, I must admit that I thought it was a prank. It wasn't. They asked me to choose another chair and I did; it was slightly more expensive but was the only one that offered lumbar support. It was delivered quickly, and it is simply a great, comfortable chair. Oh, and did I mention all of this at no charge! Thank you Colamy Home for both the replacement chair and restoring my faith in customer service! Original chair review: This is a nice, sturdy chair. However, like most office chairs, this one too appears to be made for people with small behinds. Understand, the seat is absolutely plus-sized, however, if you have any \"junk in the trunk\" there is no back support. The curved more ergonomic design reeled me in, yet there is no way to adjust the backrest. Yes, there is a lumbar support which you can push up, however, it does nothing to allow for the natural curves of those of us who are...rounder. Which means that the seat actually ends up being too big and you are either forever trying to scooch back or end up sitting toward the front of the seat (which the instructions warn you against).",

                "reviewText": "I'm a big guy who has a history of breaking chairs: beach and camping chairs, folding metal chairs, patio chairs and ... office chairs! My hope was that this chair would hold up as advertised, it certainly came at a reasonable price for a \"heavy duty\" chair. First off, it's very heavy and when you open the box you'll see why; the parts are fairly thick steel, not aluminum, the legs are a one-piece unit of welded heavy metal - very solid, the gas cylinder is like a metal dumbell and even the screws and metal lined screw holes are impressive. The seat is like a miniature loveseat - wide and thick, and it's all very easy to assemble. The hardest part was dead lifting the beast onto the cylinder, legs and wheel assembly. The assembled chair is comfortable, simple and feels very beefy. If this chair is as durable as it looks and feels, it's a score!",

No cheap plastic parts. The base, pedestal and seat to back connection is all heavy duty metal. Quality arm rests and coasters. The seat and ergonomic back are very comfortable.The assembly was a no-brainer. The hardware comes packaged in individual plastic compartments on a card so no sorting out the bolts. It even came with an allen wrench tool that's actually functional that resembles a cleat tightener for golf spikes. Some care and thought went into the tools and instructions. Everything fit and was included.This chair far exceeded my expectitions. And all for $200 bucks. Buy this chair.",

                "reviewText": "It seemed like a good idea at the time but this chair really is big and tall. It takes up a lot of space and becomes the focal point of a small office. The seat is plenty wide and cushioned well enough but pitched a bit forward and I have yet to figure out how to change that. There's a constant feeling of sliding forward. It is supposed to rock or tilt back but it's very stiff and the adjustment is only for the ability to rock, not tilt the back for comfort or a more comfortable sitting angle. There is a lumbar adjustment but it does not go far enough for my particular back support needs. I'm actually thinking of breaking it somehow and removing the piece that adjusts. The rollers have increased in noise and are not at all quiet when rolling across the floor. Also, the arms have adjustments that are very loose, sideways and front to back. When I try to adjust myself after pitching forward on the seat I grab the arms to lift up and try to slide back. The armrests snap back and forth and are not supportive of the motion to move myself back. Maybe this chair is TOO big and tall for my stature if that's possible. I'm really not happy with this purchase. I work at a computer as well as sew so needed a good chair.",

I am in it 10 to 15 hours a day durning the week. I love not having my hips touch the arm rest as the seat width is ample wide. I am able to curl one leg up and sit on it without any issue. Having the arm rest able to move up and down and side to side makes it so my arm are always comfortable. I really really love this chair! It is a heavy chair but that is to be expected as it is to hold us heavy people. Very pleased with my purchase!!!",
