                "reviewText": "I got this chair to replace my current gaming chair that I also use for working remotely. I spend most of my day glued to my desk in my chair, so it was important that I got a comfortable chair that'll last me a while. My last chair didn't have the best seat so I definitely needed an upgrade. I've used this chair and I can immediately tell the difference in how comfortable it is. Here are some details:ASSEMBLY: Super quick and simple, great quality hardware and feels sturdy right off the bat. The tools inclued in are also great quality for the price. Less than 20 minutes.MATERIALS: One thing I noticed was how nice the faux leather is. It's not the type to crumble and peel. It's soft, not too shiny, thick, and feels really nice to sit with shorts on (!!!). Doesn't collect sweat. Pretty important during the Summer.COMFORT: It's got a nice thick seat and it's actually got pretty decent back support that I wasn't expecting. It kept me upright for most of my work day and felt way better after almost a 13 hour day too. Really loving it so far. The seat itself actually supports you too with how it's shaped.WHEELS: An important part to people with carpets (me). It rolls well and doesn't have a mind of it's own. Not flimsy. The base is also made out of metal which was an upgrade for me as well.DESIGN: It looks great too. The seat is bigger than I thought and decently high back too. With it being spacious for me, it still doesn't have any extra bulk which is nice. The addition of the nice textured leather on the all black chair is also great aesthetics.10/10 recommended. It's a GREAT value for what you get at this price point.",

It isn't bad thin, don't get me wrong.Putting it together is made simple, for the less mechanically inclined.While it does lean back, it's only done through the twist thing underneath. The armrests are great and if you are a MUSICIAN, they life out of the way.It's wide enough for bigger peeps.All in all, a solid PC Chair.",
