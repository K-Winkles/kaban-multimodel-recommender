Removing from the wheeled base was not to hard, but the chair end was very hard with the end compressed into the chair stand. Videos of using a pipe wrench were not useful in my case sine it kept slipping on the stem. The solution was a vice and a large hammer to persuade the old cylinder to come free. After that the installation of the new one was simple.This is a good product and a good solution, far cheaper than buying a new chair.",

                "reviewText": "(Review from 375lb husband)Right off the bat I noticed that the lowest height setting is higher than my highest setting from the stock one that came with my chair. For context, my chair is a Samofu Ergonomic back with a foot rest. I'm not sure what the height adjustments were on stock piston, but there is a huge noticeable distance. I can't speak on the sturdiness nor longevity as i've just replaced the old piece with this one, but i'm hoping it will live up to it's claim. For those that are in a similar weight than mine, the removal of the last piston was very difficult. I followed a youtube video and used a pipe wrench to loosen the part of the piston closes to the bottom of the chair seat. I also removed the clip at the bottom of the piston and that allowed the two pieces of the piston to separate completely. I removed the wheels from the wheelbase and used a mini sledge hammer to beat the last piece of the piston out. Installation was incredibly simple and now i'm sitting atop what feel like a throne lol.",

                "reviewText": "Bought replacement to fix favorite realspace desney chair I had bought to work from home during pandemic. I am a big guy 6'3 375, and the cylinder for the chair gave out, it had been out a while.Decided to take a look at replacement cylinder to fix rather than replace favorite chair.First of all the hardest part about replacing cylinder was removal of cylinder. The following is soe advise to do so. You will need a rubber mallet or hammer. WD-40 and a pipe wrench.1. Spray wd-40 around base of chair where cylinder connects to base. let sit overnight if possible.2. To remove cylinder from bottom of chair use pipe wrench grip firmly a couple of twists later top part of cylinder is removed from chair.3. turn base over use square wooden block over the base part of the cylinder sticking out the bottom of base. And hammer out.4. After old cylinder is out line up new cylinder remove cover at top before sliding into the bottom of seatJust some advice to help anyone out there, Like i said I am a buy guy pretty sure the old cylinder was pretty in there. New cylinder appears to be sturdier and higher for sure. Chair is comfortably at typing height on kitchen table. Would definitely buy again.",
