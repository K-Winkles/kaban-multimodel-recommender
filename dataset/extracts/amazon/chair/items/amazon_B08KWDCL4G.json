These chairs feel and look more expensive than the price - a steal! The assembly was easy with the first set of legs, but when applying the set of legs, you will definitely need some elbow, bicep, tricep, quad, and hamstring grease! Whew! But it will be worth it and it will make the chair sturdy. Oh, the actual seat is super comfy and good back support. The chair feels like it hugs your bottom! I highly recommend! You won\u2019t regret your purchase! The brown grey color looks rich and modern. The brown gray is a nice beige - not too light and not too tan. Just buy them! :-D",

                "reviewText": "I purchased these chairs because of the metal frame and legs. They're comfortable to sit in. The balls of my feet touch the ground (I'm 5'4\"). The fabric has a subdued pattern to it. It does stretch out a little after being sat on--there are some wrinkles from loose fabric on the top of the chair now. The cushion in the seat is soft, which means you kind of sink right through it. I'm 125 lbs and can feel the hard seat through the cushion, but it's comfortable to sit in for meal times. Haven't tried sitting in the seats for longer than 40 minutes, but I would imagine that heavier people might find the seat hard after more than an hour. The front legs are adjustable, which is good because the chairs rock. The legs are more stable once you're sitting in them. I've dragged the chairs around and no damage to the wood floors. I like that they slide across the floor more easily than my other dining chairs, but definitely not slippery. Chairs are on the narrow side so you can fit a bunch at the table. Wider bottoms may not fit well. Sprayed the chairs down with Scotchguard and no damage to the fabric. So far, no dog hair stuck in the back crack (which I was scared of).Pros: price, comfort, sturdy (metal frame/legs), appearanceCons: wobble, seat pad too soft",

They're not super firm, but not super soft, just the right amount of firmness and comfiness. They aren't super upright which is great for me, they are a little more relaxed. Both sets came out well, no issues at all, super easy to assemble, as others said, it took about 5mins/chair. The great part is the front adjustable legs if needed.With that, I ordered another set as well to have a total of 6 chairs.They are a mix of beige/brown/grey, and they look great to me.
