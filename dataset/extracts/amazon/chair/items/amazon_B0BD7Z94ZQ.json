This chair it\u2019s actually very comfortable and appears to be a very good quality. I like the fact that you can increase the lumbar support or decrease it at any time. I do wish the back was able to set up a little bit more straight, but with pumping the lumbar all the way up that helps. I am 5\u20192\u201d and this has a great range of heighth to adjust.",

                "reviewText": "I was skeptical about making this purchase because too many good reviews often turn out to be too good to be true. In this case, I was pleasantly surprised. The chair was very easy to assemble thanks to a YouTube video. To my surprise, I put it together entirely on my own in around half an hour. As importantly, the chair is very comfortable, providing in particular the lower back I desperately need. Before I bought the office chair, I used one of the chairs that came with a dining room seat I've had for 20 years. No arrangement of pillows ever made that chair comfortable to work in for six or seven hours a day, five days a week. The office chair, however, is a game-changer both in terms of my physical comfort and my disposition (a physically comfortable worker is a happier worker). What's more, because the arms are collapsible, the chair slides right under the kitchen table that doubles as my desk. I have only one complaint about the chair: It's not leather, as advertised. It's a cheaper, less durable fabric. This means you have to be very careful about scratching it, puncturing it, even cleaning it (the instructions that come with it say this, too). Other than that, the chair is very comfortable and a good deal for the price.",

                "reviewText": "Comfort: 5 Stars. When sitting at a desk for hours upon end, this chair fits the bill. It is firm, yet comfortable. When I sit at my other desk with a different chair, my behind hurts within minutes, and that's even with a supportive cushion. The lumbar adjustment is the hidden gem. The armrests are also very comfortable and at the right height, but some may complain because the height is not adjustable.Adjustments: 5 Stars. Although it doesn't have all the bells and whistles when it comes to adjustments, it does have the basics. There is a lot of vertical travel and reclining travel as well. I haven't had a need to adjust the tension as it seems just right from the box.Appearance: 5 Stars. The pleather appears rich, and the white contrasting stitching highlights the appearance. I didn't think I would like the stitching, but it gives the appearance of quality, much like the hand-sewn stitching in the lapel of a quality suit. The fit and finish is suburb.Assembly: 5 Stars again. I figured pretty much everything out without the instructions. It took me about 30-40 minutes to put it together in a dimly lit room. I discovered that you could scan a QR code to view an instruction video. They give you spare screws and a spare cap along with a tool. Everything was wrapped securely.",

I needed a chair with arms that fold up so I can tuck the chair under the desk and give me more room next to my bed. The chair I had was bulky and took up a ton of space. This one is sleek, compact, yet stylish and comfortable. It looks and feels like high quality leather, not thin vinyl like most cheap office chairs. I am going to have to buy this chair for my son\u2019s dorm room now. I was going to give him my prior chair, but now I realize what a space saver it will be to have this type of chair for an already cramped dorm room.",
