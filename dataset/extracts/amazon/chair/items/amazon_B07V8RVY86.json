The way it reclines is very flexible and very comfy!!! You will be able to game for hours and with no complains. Also the instructions and the assembly is very easy! I enjoyed building it. A 10/10 product would recommend spending your money on this product! Now the only complain I have, would be that thick thighs can be hurt in the process because of the seat edges do go up a bit so they hurt at first but it just takes some getting used to.",

                "reviewText": "I always try to wait awhile before writing reviews to make sure I don't write a positive review on something that will just break a couple months later. I bought this gaming chair for my daughter a little over 3 months ago and my first impression was this:1. The material is incredibly soft. It almost has a silky/velvety feel to it - it's hard to explain but anytime I go into her room to visit, I sit in her chair and pretty much just pet it the entire time we're talking \ud83d\ude092. The foot rest is very easy to use & to slip back away when you don't want to use it.3. The extra pillows (1 for neck/head support & 1 for low back support) are great because they aren't just attached to one place, you can move them up or down to the right position for you.Three months later and my opinion hasn't changed. It's still incredibly soft, the adjustable pillows are still comfy, the foot rest still works great and I still pet the material when I sit in it.Overall it's just a good, well made chair, especially for the price. The next time my son needs a new chair for his room, I will definitely be looking at buying another Downix gaming chair.",

                "reviewText": "Overall this is a decent chair and I think worth the value. But it was not right for my needs so I returned it.First of all, it is small-medium size. I posted a picture because a lot of folks claimed it was small but I saw no photos of an adult male sitting in one. I am 5\u201911\u201d and 160 lbs. It is just wide enough for me to be comfortable but if I was overweight it would feel tight. My main concern was with the height. As another reviewer mentioned, taller adults will have to mount the head pillow on top of the chair and not through the holes where it is designed. With this modification it is barely big enough for me. If I was any taller I\u2019d say no way.The sturdiness of the chair is a 7/10. I didn\u2019t have any squeaks like others mentioned but the arm rests did seem a little wobbly. The chair felt sturdy enough for me but it is lighter duty. If someone was over 200lbs it might feel pretty marginal. I think if I kept it I would have to baby it. Such as not plop down in it too hard and just treat it delicately.Comfort was okay. The lower seat is stiff but others report a break in period. I did not keep it long enough to find out. It does seem like there is enough padding there but it is just stiff padding. So those claims have merit I think. The back has little padding and the lumbar pillow and neck pillow would be mandatory IMO. Without the lumbar pillow your lower back would ache immensely because it has a concave design there. Without the neck pillow the seat back is just too stiff. But I think this is expected of gaming chairs.The instructions are clear and it should not take you more than 30 minutes to assemble. Overall Dowinx seems like a very reputable company. Everything seems very professional.The color is beautiful and the material feels great. That\u2019s the only thing that made it hard to return. If it was bigger and had a little more padding in the back, I would have kept it.The four star review is mostly because I think it is smaller than it should be and in the photos it looks like it would fit an adult male easily. I really wanted to like this chair and I can tolerate it, but in a few months I feel I would regret not having more room to relax in it. It barely fits my body.I hope my review helps others trying to make a decision and struggling with the same concerns.",

                "reviewText": "First things first, I noticed a bunch of negative reviews on this product and was very hesitant since it seems to find a fabric chair at this range. I found most of it to be about build quality or the screws not fitting. After building and troubleshooting, you'll notice that the instructions are very clear on what to do and what not to do and what goes where (namely the right and left arm clearly labeled). Even without the instructions it is very easy to tell what goes where. But if you do read the instructions or know the general rule of thumb when tightening something is to not fully tighten everything one by one, but all together once all screws for that segment are in. I would suggest trying that. I found that after sticking in the foot rest, it was dangling funny (likely cuz it was upside down), all I did was undo the screws and flip it and it is perfect. Even if it was manufacturing mistake, it was fixable and if you're buying an item at like $200 something, it would be advised to follow the recommendations or at least try and troubleshoot your product before posting scathing or misleading reviews. For instance, I see one individual that claims the arm can't be attached, but if you look in the picture, they've fully attached the top bit, making it near impossible to attach the bottom bit. The other ones don't really have enough that you can see to judge whether it's on the company or the person. I'd suggest if you do have issues to have more than one picture at horrible angles to prove your point.Let's not blame the company for your oversight.Look, I'm not saying the chair is perfect, but I'd give it a fair chance since reviews can't seem to be trusted nowadays.SeatI am 5'1\" at around 190lbs. I can sit comfortably and seat back is perfect height for me. I recently got a different chair to try and a bit cheaper and it was the faux leather one. I found the back pillows to slide all over especially when you're leaning back. The two sides of the chair hug your legs and my last one was to the point of pain. It has yet to bug me as a chunkier person, it feels nice so far. The cushions look deceivingly thin since the seat cushion looks thicker in the pictures than in person. However, feels very supportive. Firm enough to deal with my weight but soft enough to be comfortable.FootrestI've had issues with other chairs being that it's flimsy and doesn't feel sturdy enough to deal with my feet resting on it. This one is quite solid to my surprise. The bar doesn't feel like it's bending downwards when I lightly rest on it like the others do.ArmrestMy previous chair had the one that's straight up and down, so there's a huge gap if I lean back. This hinge mechanism is pretty great. I was hesitant about it as it didn't seem quite smooth when attaching it. To my surprise, it is very smooth and the cushion on the top is also very thick and feels much more supportive than my last chair.Chair baseOne thing I will say that leaves a bit to be desired is that the base is plastic vs metal on other chairs. Maybe it's biasedness since I'm worried about longevity of the chair. However, the plastic used feels very heavy grade, from the base to the wheels. We'll see how it goes from here and will update if anything goes out of order. The tilting and raising function work just fine.The neck rest and lumbar support are firm and work well. The way it is fixed into the chair is also very smart in comparison to other chairs that just have a simple stretch band which will slide up and down. Most lumbar ones seem to attach the same way, but the neck one attaching into the two spots in the back was very smart, it stays still and even when leaning back, you don't have to readjust, or at least as often as others.So far, it's been pretty good to me. It is about 60 dollars more than my old chair, and it is a vast upgrade in quality and feel. Give it a shot if you're in the market for a new chair.Is recommend for people that want the lean function, foot rests and fabric finish.It happens to be the 3 things I am looking for since I will work and sleep at my desk at times. I don't like the faux leather stuff since I've had many experiences in the last with it flaking and my life is just reduced to cleaning up the bits all day every day. I will find some waterproof cover or something so I don't spill on it lol.For the chunky crowd, it is a snug fit, if you like more space, maybe a different chair will be better.",

Back support/massage pillow thing is also kind of hard but when its plugged in it feels really nice on the lower back. Love itNeck pillow is meh. I'm tall. There's no good place for these when you are tall so I'm just not using it.The gas tilt thing works great, the chair feels stable in all positions.Its a great chair honestly. And at this price its definitely worth it",
