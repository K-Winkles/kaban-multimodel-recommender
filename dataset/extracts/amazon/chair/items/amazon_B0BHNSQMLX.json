                "reviewText": "Cute chair and was fairly easy to assemble but the darn thing leans forward. I have looked all over for an adjustment or something and it is almost like there is an issue with the attachment assembly to the chair. Of course I bought this for a move to Hawaii so I didn't put it together until recently when I arrived in Hawaii so I am out of the refund time. I don't want a refund, just a fix to this darn chair. I see other peoples photos and it looks normal and flat. This is why you don't buy on Amazon because you have no idea what you are getting. I guess a trip to Office Depot for a replacement.",
