                "reviewText": "This (and a similar one from another seller) was a gift for granddaughters; Irish twins whose birthdays fall very close to one another. They really love them! They have older siblings in school, and now they feel like they are students too. The desks have pride of place in a corner of the family room, and I've seen the girls go over to their desks and pull something out of the storage box beneath the chair, as if they had important work to get to! And for two very active (rowdy) girls, they understand that they cannot sit on the desk top, which would be at risk if too much weight were placed on it - and they respect that. Seeing them treat the desks as well as they do shows they like them.Regarding assembly - anyone who's a bit handy can accomplish it. There were a few extra screws in case something got lost, but I didn't need them, so they'll sit in the junk drawer for a decade or two and then get tossed. Instructions and illustrations were clear. The basket that sits beneath the seat is not robust, but as long as it's used as intended I don't see it getting clobbered right away. I had the inspiration to give the girls a bunch of my old office supplies: pads of paper, colored pencils, post-it pads, as well as some pipe cleaners and a few badge lanyards from my employer that were sitting around. Overall - highly recommended.",

It's very easy to clean and love the added drawer underneath. The only complaint is there's nothing that keeps the drawer from being pushed all the way out the back of the desk unless it's up against a wall. Highly recommend great desk for the price!",
