Looking closely at other brands I could see they didn't fit as well as these, especially around the bottom. They really don't look like slipcovers, which I suppose is the point. What a great and inexpensive way to switch up the look and cover the very worn, flaking faux leather underneath. I washed the old ones and they came out perfect. They're now stored for when I'm ready for the next change.",
