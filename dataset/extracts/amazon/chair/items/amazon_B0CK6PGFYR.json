It is pretty small, as I am a small person and fit just right. The chair pad does not stay in place which is a little annoying, but it is comfortable to sit in! Again, for the price it is perfect.",

                "reviewText": "This chair is nice-ish and easy to assemble. I guess for the price one can\u2019t complain toooo much. Pros: Looks nice. Easy to put together. Made decent, nothing falls apart. Adjusts easily. Cons: Made for a teen, I weigh about 125 pounds and I am 5\u20194 and my arse literally feels like it is hanging off the edge. Cushion is flimsy and thin. Doesn\u2019t get very tall, at top height it was just at desk level. Let us just say, if you need a chair to sit in a spot just for a few minutes to look up something on Amazon, okay, but to work in? NO WAY. If you weigh more than 135-140, forget it. Teen? Yes buy. Make up mirror? Yes buy! Just sitting at a desk but never used? Yes buy. Guest chair for skinny guest to watch computer, while you look up Amazon yes buy. Want a kitchen desk chair? Yes buy! College student studying? Maybe, if you are a small man or female.Final words: This is not a chair to work in for more than an hour or your back will kill you, and you will die. Point made? If you are 150 lbs or more, buy two, one for each cheek. Get my drift? Good chair, nothing wrong with it, but ONLY useful for certain situations. 4 star for ease and looks. Really a 3 for overall performance, chair pad, and arse situation.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this chair to put in my storage shed so that I can work on my motorcycle. The mechanics stool that I have in there is too low to the ground and it offers no back support whatsoever! This chair is just right for working a few hours on the bike, and I have no back pain afterwards. This chair is very comfortable and sturdy, and I don\u2019t feel like I am going to tip over. The thick plastic construction of this chair means that it should last for quite some time. The only thing I would complain about is that the wheels don\u2019t lock, but for the price point, I can live with that! I put this chair together in less than 5 minutes and it even comes with a good Allen Wrench that I threw into my toolbox afterwards. At 6ft-250lbs., there\u2019s no strain on the chair at all! It\u2019s easy to raise and lower and the chair is solidly built. I highly recommend it.",

This chair is uncomfortable, small, and feels like it won't last long - seems cheaply made. :/ We already put it together so Idk how we can even return it .... taking it all the way apart will not be a pleasant experience. Just buy the $60+ chair instead of trying to save $20.",
