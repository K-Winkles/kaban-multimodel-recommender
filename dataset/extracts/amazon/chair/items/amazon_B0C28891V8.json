                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A good starter chair that adjusts well",
                "reviewText": "This chair works well for me, but the comfort of chairs can depend on your size and shape (I'm 5'6, 120 lbs, with a long torso, so the lumbar support hits me just right). A tall or large person might not feel the same amount of comfort.Main points:[+] This is a support chair, not a squishy chair. The seat is firm and because the fabric is made of mesh netting with little holes that are hard to clean, it's not a chair for slobs. If you eat lunch in your chair and rain down little bits of sandwich while typing, this is not the chair for you. If you want a chair that's like sinking into your couch for a nap, this is not the chair for you. Actually, most ergonomic chairs are probably not it.[+] The seat tension control doesn't do a ton, so if the most important thing in a chair to you is the ability to recline or tilt forward, this isn't the chair for you.[+] Alternatively, if you're like me and you find that most chairs don't support the line of your back, so that you end up with a gap between you and the back support, this is a good chair. The mesh back supports your back without being stiff. Once you get the lumbar support calibrated, it's really comfortable. But again, the lumbar support pushes up and down, not forward and back. If you're looking for that chair that's going to shove you to the end of the seat, this isn't it.[+] There are a bunch of chairs with this design offered by multiple vendors. You take your chances with all of them. I'm happy with this one: the arm rests raise and lower, the lumbar support raises and lowers, the seat chair has a tension knob, the head rest raises and lowers. Is it customizable to a herman miller level? No, but it's also 1/5 the price. You really do get what you pay for, and for the price, this as adjustable as your money will be.[+] The construction is good enough. I can understand how a handful of people might end up with parts that don't quite fit together no matter how hard you turn the allen wrench. If you're mentally prepared for that and are willing to send back the chair for a replacement, then don't worry about the negative reviews about quality. Not every chair that comes off a factory line is a winner, and this is a factory chair at a factory mass produced price.[+] The chair comes with a pair of gloves. Put them on and wear them while piecing the chair together. You'll be surprised at the grease that's on the gloves when you're finished.[+] Putting the chair together was extremely easy and can be done by a single person. Engineering skill doesn't matter, but patience (and not having a quick temper) does. Read the instructions, prepare the bolts ahead of time so you're not trying to put the washer on while you're holding the seat in the air. Start all the bolts so they hold, but don't tighten until they're all in. Make sure the metal bits are flat against the seat when you tighten the allen wrench, especially the arm rests. Once the metal seat adjuster piece goes on, the seat becomes pretty heavy and unwieldy, so make sure to get the arm rests on straight first.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:\u25cb Comfortable mesh back and sponge lumbar support\u25cb Adjustable armrests and headrest provide extra support and customization options\u25cb Thick cushioning adds an extra level of comfortCons:\u25cb Armrests could be wider to accommodate different body types\u25cb Limited adjustability options may not fit all individual needs\u25cb Chair could be a bit heavier to prevent accidental tipping or slidingReview:The ergonomic office chair is a recent purchase of mine, and I couldn't be happier. The chair came with clear instructions and was very simple to put together. Long periods of sitting are made incredibly comfortable by the mesh back and sponge lumbar support. The adjustable armrests and headrest are also a great feature, and the thick cushion adds an extra layer of comfort.I work from my desk for a lot of the day, so having a comfortable chair is crucial. Regarding comfort and support, this chair has unquestionably surpassed my expectations. My neck and shoulders receive excellent support from the high back as well.The wheels glide easily across my hardwood floor, and the swivel feature is simple to operate. Overall, if you're looking for a supportive and comfy office chair, I'd strongly suggest this chair. I've seen a significant improvement in my everyday comfort while working, therefore it's well worth the money.Despite the chair's excellent comfort and support, there were a few annoying problems that kept me from giving it a perfect score. The armrests may first be a little bit wider to accommodate various body types. Second, the chair might be more customizable to match each person's needs by offering more adjustability options. The chair is strong and well-made, although it should be a little bit heavier to avoid any unintentional tipping or sliding.These are comparatively small problems that don't dramatically lower the chair's overall performance or quality.

                "reviewText": "UPDATE:After Posting my review detailing the issues I've had, the seller reached out and offered to replace the chair for free, even after owning it for over 2 years! The new chair is still very comfortable, but the armrests are much stiffer than before, but this may be due to the durability issues people have been facing. Assembly is very easy and comes with a tool. I've had this new one for a couple of months now and it seems to be holding up well.I've had this chair for just over 2.5 years now. After only a couple months, the bottom of the left armrest pad started coming apart, and by now, an entire section has broken off, and continues to fall apart; the right pad is falling apart as well. Also, the locking mechanism for the back rest has broken. I'm a big guy, but still well within the 330lb weight limit for the chair. I'm used to cheap chairs falling apart after a year or 2, but at $260, I wouldn't consider this a cheap chair, so I'm pretty disappointed with the armrests and locking mechanism.That being said, the chair is very comfortable. It's the most comfortable office chair I've owned and is only beat by a $1700 chair I used to have at work. The seat padding is very comfortable and still in good shape, the headrest, while a pretty flimsy, works well, and the backrest breathes very well, is comfortable, and isn't showing any signs of wear. The rubber wheels it comes with are really nice for hard wood floors. I do not have a mat under it and after all this time, there is no scarring on the floor.",

The lumbar support is great, as many other reviews suggested.Bought two at once. They shipped four minutes apart and arrived nearly two weeks apart. One had what appears to be cosmetic damage on the arm where the plastic molding attaches to the metal. Sent photo and got a prompt and pleasant reply and the immediate shipping of a new armrest. Unfortunately, it wasn't the damaged part, but it is the part that will eventually need replacement, as that's just the lifecycle of armrests.I don't foresee them sending me something else; they are a business and we hardly even notice it. It looks not to be structural.",

                "reviewText": "La silla fue f\u00e1cil de armar (30 min), las instrucciones claras en 7 pasos ilustrados. No hay pierde. Sugiero tener cuidado de no sobre apretar, pero tampoco dejar los tornillos medio flojos.Visualmente, la silla es bonita, moderna y elegante, con la base porta ruedas 100% de metal.La primera impresi\u00f3n que tienes al sentarte es que el coj\u00edn es duro, pero despu\u00e9s de un rato de estar sentado, te das cuenta de que es muy c\u00f3modo y me da la impresi\u00f3n que no se va a deformar como otros cojines que de entrada son m\u00e1s suave y parecen m\u00e1s c\u00f3modos hasta que ceden por completo (como mi silla anterior).Es soporte lumbar es el punto estelar de esta silla, aunque quiz\u00e1s le puede quedar alto a personas de baja estatura. El respaldo se ajusta muy bien a tus necesidades y da un buen soporte (despu\u00e9s de una semana de jugar con el ajuste, finalmente me acomod\u00f3 en el setting m\u00ednimo). No vi ninguna otra silla con un mecanismo solido y tan ajustable como este a este precio. S\u00f3lo lo ves en las sillas super caras (de m\u00e1s de 20 mil pesos).Tambi\u00e9n me gustaron mucho sus ruedas ultra silenciosas, ya que no son de pl\u00e1stico duro y ruidoso, sino de un material m\u00e1s suave que no raya el piso. Lo que s\u00ed es que si tu piso no est\u00e1 bien nivelado, las ruedas se mueven con facilidad.El respaldo es muy c\u00f3modo y fresco, y te puedes echar para atr\u00e1s ajustando la resistencia de la inclinaci\u00f3n (incluso bloquear la posici\u00f3n, pero a mi me gusta sin bloqueo). El respaldo est\u00e1 hecho de malla, y no tengo idea que tan duradero ser\u00e1. Pero me gust\u00f3 que el asiento en s\u00ed, no fuera de malla, como otras sillas, ya que en el trasero s\u00ed creo conviene un coj\u00edn como el que trae esta silla, aunque al principio, como es ortop\u00e9dico, si lo sientes un poco duro, pero c\u00f3modo. Creo que esta silla no es para los que les gusta echarse para atr\u00e1s todo el tiempo y subir los pies al escritorio, ya que la silla como que te empuja a sentarte derecho. Est\u00e9 efecto puede no acomodar a algunas personas. Para trabajar y sentarte derecho, me parece una muy buena silla. Para echar las flojera reclinado, no tanto.No hab\u00eda tenido una silla con cabecera, pero despu\u00e9s de varios d\u00edas descubr\u00ed que es c\u00f3moda cuando te echas para atr\u00e1s.No le rechina nada. Ya con el tiempo ver\u00e9 si surge alg\u00fan ruido y qu\u00e9 tan duradera me resulta.Tiene un rango de altura amplio, y con el ajuste de altura de los descansabrazos no pegar\u00e1 con ning\u00fan escritorio est\u00e1ndar.Mi \u00fanica cr\u00edtica es que los descansabrazos son cortos. Cuando est\u00e1s sentado derecho funcionan bien, pero cuando te echas para atr\u00e1s, no tienes d\u00f3nde descansar los codos. Hay una versi\u00f3n que los puede mover hacia adelante y hacia atr\u00e1s (los de esta silla solo abajo y arriba), pero en esa versi\u00f3n sube demasiado el precio. Definitivamente esto es lo que menos me gusta de la silla.En fin, le dediqu\u00e9 un mont\u00f3n de horas para escoger esta silla entre cientos de sillas. Soy un poco clavado. Pero \u00e9sta fue para mi la ganadora, y no creo que encuentres una silla de est\u00e1 calidad, a este precio. No es tan barata, pero peso x peso me parece que es la mejor.",
