                "reviewText": "I didn't know that this cover existed until I randomly came across it. It's very useful for me actually because my garage gets so dirty. This cover protects my white plastic chairs from getting dust on them, which saves me time and from getting embarrassed when it's time to quickly pull them out and offer them to guests. The handle is sturdy enough to hold/transfer the chairs from inside the house to the garage. My chairs are made of plastic, so I have no issue carrying them but you may have to watch the weight if your chair are made of steel. Overall, a great product that makes my life cleaner!",

                "reviewText": "We have a dozen standard metal folding chairs that been stored in their original, deteriorating cardboard boxes for years. This is a better cover and the handle makes them easier to carry.However, the marketing photos show this cover when full as a nice, neat package with squarish, straight lines. Its not. Its just a synthetic bag full of chairs.The buckle at the bottom holds the sides together OK but the drawstring was very difficult to tighten and leaves way too much slack.Four metal chairs really does feel like the limit without ripping the handle off. We'll have to see if this remains durable for long.",
