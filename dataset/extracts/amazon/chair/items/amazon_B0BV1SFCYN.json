He didn't realize I had had towel clips for about 6 years from our past annual grandmother/mother/daughter beach vacays. I mean, in all fairness, why would he? However, when I mentioned I had towel clips BEFORE he purchased these because he didn't beliveve the ones we had would actually secure our towels, I can't explain. Regardless, he packed these wonderful clips and guess what? They held our towels in place perfectly! In a pinch, they can also be used as chip clips.",
