Because of the design of the loungers we really couldn't use them at the bottom, but didn't need them. They stayed very secure at the top. I mostly saw people using clips which would have taken up more room in my luggage and would also break. I plan to use these at home and at the beach. Great affordable purchase. These will last a long time.",
