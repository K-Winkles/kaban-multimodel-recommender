                "reviewText": "Ordered this as my first office chair because I don't like the bucket-y gaming chairs.PROS - Sturdier than I expected, the seat feels huge, the back gives me plenty of room to shift and get comfy, and I have extra space on the sides under the arms when I sit because the arms don't overlap the seat at all. I also like that the arms flip up and tuck far enough back where you really don't bump into them. The stretchy back on the chair is AWESOME, better than the mesh-y ones at work and more \"bouncy\". I also like that it was easy to assemble and if assembled correctly it doesn't make that plastic snap/creaking noise that some chairs do when you sit and move.CONS - My only con for this chair is that I wish the stretchy fabric on the back had another layer or was woven thicker. It is plenty supportive and comfortable, but I'll have to wait and see how it wears out over time as I use it.*NOTE - I used leftover wheels from a gaming chair after assembling everything except the wheels provided in the package; the wheels pictured DO NOT come with the chair! However, if you do this, the chair sits up much higher and rolls more smoothely. But combined w my memory foam cushion, I now sit too high and only my toes still touch the floor (even on the shortest setting LOL).",

                "reviewText": "We got this chair for my husband\u2019s home office. It rolls super smooth and quiet, it\u2019s very light weight, it has built-in lumbar support and it\u2019s a good comfortable sized chair for both his body type (and mine). He\u2019s an average sized male a little over 200 lbs.He only had two complaints. One was that the padding on the seat cushion could\u2019ve been better. He also likes to recline a little bit and doesn\u2019t like that you can\u2019t adjust it in that laid-back position.My husband plays guitar, and he likes that you can lift arms out of the way if you want to. He likes the mesh material because it\u2019s breathable and you don\u2019t get as hot. We purchased it in the black color, and it looks sleek and nice.It\u2019s an absolute value at this price! He likes it, and would have no problem at all, purchasing it again.We hope this helps you in your search for a good rolling desk chair!",
