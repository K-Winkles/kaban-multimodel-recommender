                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Its much better than nothing and much cheaper than higher quality chairs",
                "reviewText": "I'm a big believer in \"you get what you pay for\" and I usually advise to save up, make one purchase, make one investment and don't worry about it for a few years. But something about this chair's value really scales, especially if you can grab it on sale. I got mine in white for $75 including tax and shipping. Many quality gaming chairs cost hundreds of dollars. There a handful of cheap office chairs you can snag for $60. This chair compared to one of those generic office chair is worth the extra $15. If you're looking at this chair for $90 or higher, then the former statement is true (save up). Anyway. I've had this chair for a day now and it isn't perfect. I'll go over what I like and what I don't like.Appearance: It looks nice. Doesn't look or feel too cheap. The base is metal with plastic feet. Many chairs have plastic base with plastic feet.+1ptFunctionality: This chair has a handful of features--You can adjust the height. +1ptBut it only has about a 3in range -1ptIt has a lock to let you remain upright and can be unlocked so you can recline back. +1ptIt does NOT have a way to lock in the reclined position. -1ptComfort: This chair is pretty comfy. It has a removable/adjustable head pillow and a removable/adjustable lumbar pillow as well. +1ptIt is a little stiff. Some people may like that. It also may break it after a while. I've only had it one day so I will update if something new develops. The chair has a *mostly* comfortable width to me. It measures 19\" for arm to arm. But it has this little \"cushion\" that tries to contour your legs that makes it a little uncomfortable to sit with my legs spread even a little. I have to keep my knees closer together than I normally would to keep the \"cushion\" from digging into the side of my legs. Because of this, there is really only about 16\" of room for your butt or the sides of your thighs. I'm about 5'10\" Male 215lbs size 38 pants XL shirt. I think I am at the cusp of being able to comfortably sit in this. It was not made with larger people in mind. It does state a 250lb weight limit while we're on the topic. -1ptAssembly: I've assembled several office chairs before and this process was similar and just as easy. +1ptIf you aren't experienced or if you struggle with Ikea stuff, you may find it difficult. The hardware that they include is kinda junk. If you have the luxury of using your own hardware (or hand tools at least), I would highly recommend it. I had one bolt that had really junky threads from the factory and I couldn't do much about it, just had to cross thread it and tighten it the best I could. I had another bolt that stripped and the thread never would grab. Luckily there was one extra included in the packaging and I ended up being able to tighten it without cross threading. I think I got lucky. 90% of the assembly was smooth sailing and the few snags that arose, I knew exactly what to do. Again, if you aren't experienced with this, it could easily turn into a headache and a return to amazon over poor quality hardware",

                "reviewText": "The chair came very well packaged in perfect condition and ready to assemble.Instructions were simple and I assembled it alone in less than 30 minutes.Seems sturdy and comfortable. I have back and neck issues and standard office chairs often do not have enough support. I bought this because I wanted something that would have a high back with enough support in both those areas.The only minor complaint I could give is that the sides to the chair are a little firm and higher than the seat pad, so for those of us who are wider of hip/thigh, that might cause a pressure issue over time. But that might be my signal to eat better!Love the fact they send spare screws so that when something inevitably gets lost in a move, you have extras.And for just over $150 CAD once shipping was paid, its a hell of a bargain in comparison to most office or gaming chairs out there.",
