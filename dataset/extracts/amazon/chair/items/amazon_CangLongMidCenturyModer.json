They are lightweight, but sturdy and easy to assemble. I am a heavy woman, so I am weary about chairs I have to assemble. I have had them for 4 months now and just absolutely love them! I love the retro look and the brown/tan/mustard color. Oh, and finally, they don't take up too much space.",

I tried reaching out to the seller but they asked for a lot of pictures and said that it must be some mistake because it\u2019s unlikely that both chairs would be made defectively. I got them on sale for $67 now they are almost $120. Do not waste your time or money. Sadly after the great price I I will be returning. Otherwise they look really good and comfortable.",
