The instructions are clear and the parts labeled, so it\u2019s a pretty quick build. All the parts seem to be extremely sturdy. Once built, it\u2019s a very comfortable chair. Great for shorter people.",

                "reviewText": "Our house is really small. I was looking for the perfect little office chair that didn\u2019t take up a lot of space and had a minimalistic, simple look. This one is just what I was looking for! The quality is really nice, putting it together was actually really fun and easy. The directions were straight forward and easy to follow. I even saw an instructional video on here but, I forgot to put it on when the time came. It comes with everything you need, it even includes the tools! I put it together myself in about 10 minutes. I\u2019m in love with the outcome! It matches perfectly with my little table/desk. It rolls around very smoothly and easily. I definitely recommend!",

It was easy to assemble and all the necessary hardware and tools were provided. I was particularly impressed with the high quality of the components. The seat and back rest are very thickly padded, covered in quality leather, and very well made. Even the bolts were coated with thread locking compound so that they won't work themselves loose over time. The price was far less than you would expect for a chair of this quality and the chair was available with free shipping.",

For YEARS I had been using my dining room chair and I should have invested in a good office chair a long time ago, but I just wasn\u2019t in a good physical space to do so. With the dining room chair I needed a back support cushion and a butt cushion. Now, I don\u2019t need either! The chair is so easy to assemble a toddler could do it, and it was done in less than an hour! I\u2019m giving it four stars cause I ordered the white chair and the picture displays as white but what I received is definitely khaki colored. If I would have known that I would have gotten black. So the manufacturer needs to change that from white to khaki. Other than that, this chair is wonderful, and I do hope it lastsn",

I love being able to roll to my other machines without having to get up and physically lift the chair over! lol I love that it\u2019s height is adjustable too - my machines are all on different tables so that was a must!Assembly was very easy! All the screws and tools were provided which was nice! I had it together in about 15 minutes.Only complaint about it was the wheels, nothing wrong with them, just kind of subpar wheels. I have textured wood tile, so that\u2019s probably why they didn\u2019t roll super smoothly. But no worries! I replaced the wheels with another \u201croller blade\u201d style and it\u2019s perfect!I love the modern style and color too! I may have to get another for my computer desk! lol!",
