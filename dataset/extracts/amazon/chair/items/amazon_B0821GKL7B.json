Ordered in color \u201csand.\u201d Took a few different pics in different lighting to show they aren\u2019t yellow, just in the light they can be different. They\u2019re a bit long and bunch at the bottom, but I\u2019m sure once I straighten them all out, I can maybe touch the bottoms so they don\u2019t bunch so much in the back. Texture is nice too. Feel well made and I like that I could get 6 and not have to get 8 w/2 orders of 4. Would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "The taupe color of these chair covers is perfect, at least for me. Definitely not khaki or tan and not too gray either. Less gray than in photos. The sizing and fit is not so great. I carefully read and wrote down the measurements listed before I purchased. I compared them with the measurements that I took from my old vintage solid oak chairs. These chairs have no padding on the back just barely 1/2 inch thick along the top board. No cushion or padding and these covers barely fit. My chair back height is 21 1/4 inches and the listing states up to 23 1/2 inches. My chair back width is 19 1/2 inches and the listing states 19 inches, so my chair is 1/2 inch wider, but I have no padding on these chairs just a strip of wood. My seat depth is 14 3/4 inches and seat across the front is 18 inches. In the listing the seat depth and front are both 21 inches so there should have been extra room. I really struggled to get these covers on. Using my hands I gathered the fabric all the way up to the top seam and put the top corner on one side then carefully stretched across to the other side trying to align the seam. It was very difficult. I then stretched the fabric down to the seat area again gathering up the front and pulling down over the front and then back of the seat. Seams on both sides of the seat pull and ride up and the bottom elastic edge doesn\u2019t quite cover the wood strip across the back. They are nice covers and the taupe is a beautiful color, but if you have a padded parsons chair I think you will be out of luck. The listing also mentions allowing a half inch or so for error. That is a big factor especially if you have a padded chair.I purchased a set from another company a month before (Colorxy) that fit absolutely perfect with room to spare. They stretch well and were exceedingly easy to put on, stay in place, and they look terrific. Unfortunately, they do not offer solid fabrics. They are all prints. For the spring and summer I chose the monstera leaf print, but wanted a solid neutral for fall and winter so I had to look elsewhere. I will keep these covers because of the color, but will continue to check back with Colorxy to see if they expand to solid colored fabrics.",
