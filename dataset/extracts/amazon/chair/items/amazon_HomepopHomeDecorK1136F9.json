                "reviewText": "I ordered this because of the price and it was one of the few chair choices I could get one (without spending a ton), rather than a 2 or 4 set. I'm using it in a make shift home office, probably sitting on it 5+ hours a day on average.Overall, it's probably in the middle range in terms of quality and comfort in the 'nice looking but inexpensive' selection of chairs. It arrived in 3 days (to DC area) and I took several photos and picked this one as I thought color was more accurate in terms of fabric used.I like:- Assembly was simple and took maybe 15 minutes. I did use my own tools and allen wrenches.- It is decently made. It feels sturdy and isn't terrible in terms of comfort when sitting extended periods. The tall back I think really helps.- Looks for professional than a cheap office chair. When we're back to office work, it's nice enough to find a home as an accent chair elsewhere.I dislike:- At the price, I can find chairs in sets that look much nicer in terms of accents or construction. However, they all required by buying multiple, which I did not need.Overall, but a bad chair for the price. If you need 4 you may be able to find something better, but if you're in my situation I say go for it.",

I wouldn't recommend this chair if you are looking for something that will get a lot of use.",
