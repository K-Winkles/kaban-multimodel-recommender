                "reviewText": "This pillow provides good support and is made with memory firm. The straps are made of material that stretch very easily to fit any size chair. I have a larger size desk chair and was concerned that they wouldn't be able to wrap all the way around, but they easily do. The pillow seems to stay in place well, but you can also easily slide it up or down for more lower or higher support. My only dissatisfaction with it is that it's around an inch too thick in my opinion. It looks like most lumbar support pillows for chairs are around 4-5 inches thick. But it almost feels like it's pushing me out of the chair. Maybe it's just that I'm not used to it, but I would rather have a pillow that provides support, but doesn't make me feel unwelcome in my chair. Perhaps I'll get used to it over time. I will say, however, this thing will force you to sit up straight. So if you're not ready to commit to that, it's not for you. I would say FOR THE PRICE, it's definitely worth it, but if it were over $20, I'd go for something better.",
