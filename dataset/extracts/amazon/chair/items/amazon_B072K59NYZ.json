                "reviewText": "I purchased this product for my 2023 Corolla. The product listing states that it fits cars universally. The straps on the back of the pillow are elastic, but do not extend far enough to strap to the Corolla's front seats. Despite this, just laying the pillow in the lumbar area seems to work pretty well.This pillow is NOT firm. It is very plush. It becomes even more plush when it's hot out and your car warms up. If you are looking for very solid support - look elsewhere. If you are like me and prefer something more plush, then proceed. This pillow succeeded in eliminating back pain I was experiencing during long car rides in my bucket seats. It reinforced good posture in me and filled the gap that was causing me pain.Note: I have seen other reviewers complaining about the pillow while uploading pictures of the pillow being attached in the wrong orientation.UPDATE: This pillow essentially becomes a rock during winter when it's left out in the cold. Not sure if this problem exists in other pillows, though I suspect it may just be a material property of most memory foams? The pillow becomes softer again after it warms up from you sitting on it.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Possibly used and does not fit some chairs properly",
                "reviewText": "I bought this new but received what looks like a possibly used item. As other reviewers have stated, there appears to be small black hairs on the inside if you unzip it. Now, to be fair I'm unsure if it's actually human hair or simply remnants of the manufacturing process. It's possible they could be from the outer casing as they do match the black color. No way to tell for sure, but it was certainly off-putting. Also, this back pillow will not fit securely all chairs, or at least it didn't with mine. It's fine when using it, I'm only talking about when not in use, i don't like how it is loosely secured. To explain, my office chair has a mild curve to the back of it. Problem is, this back pillow lines up with the apex of the curved chair back, and since this only has one strap on the middle of it it ends up just kind of loosely sitting there with a big gap a the top where it doesn't make contact with the back of the chair. Not a big deal and does not affect it's usefulness, but i still don't like it. The solution to this is to have 2 straps to secure it, one on the top and one on the bottom. Other similar back pillows sold here do have that, so i bought one of those instead, and it did solve that issue. Other than those 2 problems, this is a good or at least an ok back pillow. It does provide some support, though it is memory foam so it will definitely flatten somewhat (by around half it's thickness) if you use if for more than half an hour or so. It also does not have good ventilation (memory foam never does) but that is not an issue if you're in a cool place with air conditioning. The only other option i know of would to get the \"mesh\" version of these lumbar support products. In any case, this is an good and alright product. It's a back pillow so hey, there's not much you can say about it.",
