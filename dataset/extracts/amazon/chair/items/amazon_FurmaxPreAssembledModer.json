Also, the price is excellent.Cons: Not terribly sturdy. Good for day-to-day use, if you are careful, for adults; I doubt they'd stand up to even a year of my 9 and 11-year-old girls.Excellent for guest chairs, extra chairs, or day-to-day use in an adult household. Great emergency chairs for last-minute, unexpected guests, especially given the price. Since I bought them for exactly that, I am very pleased!",

                "reviewText": "Chairs are nice but are time consuming to put together. The legs are wrapped in netting followed by slip on styrofoam for protection. When the legs were connected to the bracket in manufacturing, they went through the netting which also locked the upper pieces of styrofoam. The way to remove them is to carefully cut them off or remove bracket.I cut the first one and ripped the netting of but that left some debris around the screws so I unassembled the bracket on the rest. Doing so will involve removing them one at a time ensuring you put the holding bracket back facing the correct way. Tedious yes but it's the best way to assemble. It will also test your patience as some of the holding brackets don't fully line up when attaching screw to the chair but I assure you that they will work (start with securing the screw in the one that looks most off). Chair quality is reflected in the price paid but decent looking and works well.",

                "reviewText": "First, let's talk about the products themselves. When I pulled these out of the box, I immediately noticed how flimsy they felt. I figured, well, they were just about the cheapest dining chairs on amazon so I wasn't expecting great things anyway. Then we started trying to assemble them. My husband is a skilled tradesman and handy man so normally I don't even worry about assembling items, the man can assemble anything. Not these chairs. They are so cheaply made and even the screws and screw holes are threaded opposite directions, making assembly impossible. Whats worse, when we did manage to get one half way assembled, my husband (who is not a large person) sat in it and it looked like the legs were going to buckle under his weight. We immediately packed them up and started the process of getting a refund.That was ten days ago and the boxes are still sitting in my living room. Why? Because the seller wanted me to pay return shipping (I bought two of these sets and the boxes are HEAVY. No) and a 15% restocking fee. Meaning my refund would basically be non existent. They sent me a return label that requires postage. I have contacted amazon about it three times now and they have contacted the seller but every time they do, they tell me I have to give the seller two business days to respond before they can help me again. The seller messaged me to ask for pictures of the \"screw holes\"... What a waste of my time. How are they going to be able to see that they are threaded the wrong way from a picture? They aren't, they are just trying to keep me on the hook until their 30 day return policy ends so they can say there is no way they can help me. Amazon says they will refund my shipping costs, but first I have to borrow a truck (boxes won't fit in my car), drag them to a shipping carrier, pay for shipping, and then wait for them to process a refund for the shipping. This has been such a headache, just save yourself the trouble and buy *LITERALLY* anything else. Or, as another option, take the money you would spend on this, get it in cash, and then just light it on fire.",
