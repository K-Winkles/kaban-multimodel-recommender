This chair is a great price for the quality! The seat cushion is nicely padded, and at 5'3 I can sit cross-legged comfortably in this chair. I also love that the arm rests can go up or down. This chair was very easy to assemble, my 8 year old was able to help me. I definitely recommend this chair if you are looking for something nice but don't want to spend hundreds of dollars. Plus the colors are SO CUTE!",

It is lightweight yet has very sturdy construction. It was easier to assemble than almost any piece of furniture I've ever bought. And the assembly instructions are very good. It's also a lot of fun to just sit in the chair and spin around in a circle. Haha. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this chair during the Black Friday sale. Given the reasonable price, I was concerned that this chair would be a cheap pile of plastic. In reality, it's shockingly well made. Let's start from the ground up. The legs are made of metal and not plastic. The casters are the best I've had on any chair. They roll smoothly and well. The seat is padded enough to be supportive. The back is substantial with very good lumbar support. The arms fold up so I can shove the chair under my computer desk so it it's in the way. I love this feature! The chair is truly ergonomic. The site tips you forward just slightly. The lumbar back support is in the right place and my elbows rest on the arms while I'm typing. The height of the chair is easily adjustable with a range of nearly 5 inches. That's more than I've seen in other chairs.Now let's talk about assembly. The chair came well packed and there were good assembly directions. They provided a long Allen wrench with a long handle. There were extras of every screw and washer. They included white gloves. I thought that was cool but unnecessary. Most of the screw holes aligned well. But I found installation to be a bit frustrating. Don't worry, there's an easy fix. The chair's arms were connected to what they call a \"bracket\". Each arm needed to be attached to the back of the chair first and then to the seat. It was difficult to hold things together at the right angle to insert the screws and washers. The workaround is simple.. recruit two more arms - a spouse, neighbor, kid, etc. They can hold things in the right place while you align, insert, and tighten the screws. The chair only goes together one way so it isn't likely that you'd need to hire a handyman to do it for you.It took me a few hours to put the chair together (including time to look up new curse words on the Urban Dictionary website). The manufacturer provides you with an assembly video but requires that you register the product first. Sure, let's give lots of private information to a company I hadn't heard of before to register a product I didn't now if I was going to keep. ;) In the end, I was pleased that I was able to get the chair all screwed up (Ok, assembled). This morning I showed it off to the students who were in my 3 Zoom fitness Classes. They were all really impressed with it. If you buy yourself one, I think you'll like it as well.",

                "reviewText": "This is the SECOND chair I have ordered from this company. The 1st was the orange model with the head rest for my husbands office chair. He loved his so I ordered this pink one without the headrest for my home craft room. I spend 10+ hours at times hunched over a sewing projects. Improper back support was really becoming an issue. The lumbar support that this chair has, with the ability to adjust to my trunk length is a huge advantage for support and comfort. The padded seat and width of the seat is more then adequate. I am a smaller US size 2, and the seat width is massive for my build. The seat width can comfortably accommodate someone with a much larger derriere.Shipping was over 2 weeks to receive the chair so order with expectation of a month to get it. Other then this, the chair was quite easy to assemble. The chair itself is sturdy and quite comfortable. Color was accurate with the pictures depicted. The cost was far bellow retail in big box stores for far less quality of a chair with less choice in color selection. I recommend this chair for comfort, value, and color selection",
