                "reviewText": "This is my third different Lumbar support pillow.As a truck driver I tweaked my back about 5 years ago and got a slightly herniated disk that never quite went away. The pain is hardly noticeable except if I sleep a certain way. But it will not go away probably because as a driver I'm always bouncing around in the truck.So I thought I would try out lumber pillows. My first one was a basic cylindar type pillow that worked fine. I noticed less pain at night in certain positions. But when I got a new truck the seat was not a good fit for that cylinder pillow so I got a small wedge type pillow. That pillow hurt my kidneys as it was not tapered enough at the tapered end.So I decided to try this one. Perfect!! I had zero problems with it. I actually forgot it was there it was so comfortable. Maybe finally my back will totally heal. I will update this in a couple of months or so.Update: 12/30/23Just after a few weeks my back discomfort is gone. I can now sleep in that one position that I haven't slept in years, without waking up in pain. That slight hernia I had for years is finally healing fully simply because this product gives your lower back the correct alignment it needs while sitting.",

I would rate this pillow a 10/10 it GREATLY reduces my back pain while sitting on my couch. Yes you can use it without using the straps and it is a good size easy to position and doesn't move around once I lean against it. I am very glad I bought this as I was quickly furnishing my apartment and bought a cheap couch. This makes up for that.",

                "reviewText": "This product has proper support, excellent installation methods that hold it's position rather well and rather good comfort in my opinion. However, this product is definitely not meant for everyone.Simply put, the lumbar support is very apparent but it's also rather intense. I personally wish they had a model of this with maybe half the support. That said, it's also probably due to the design of my chair. I have a standard, flat back office chair so any alterations to it's seating design are very apparent. I imagine this would be great with more cushioned or curved style seat backing.Otherwise, it's comfortable and doesn't make my back feel like it's been resting against solid plastic or wood anymore. I'd say it's at least worth trying out for the quality and design that's gone into this alone.",
