                "reviewText": "Review is for GABRYLLY Ergonomic Mesh Office Chair, High Back Desk ChairI was a little concerned about this chair being that I am only 5'4\" and according to the description, this chair is meant for a taller person.Don't worry, it fits fine, without issues. I can easily place both feet right on the ground, even being a \"short\" person. I use a foot rest anyway, so I see no issues if you are shorter using this chair.This chair is quite comfortable to sit in, with the back being very straight up. This is good and bad. You get lots of support like this, when you want to sit completely straight, but can easily lean back a bit for more comfort, when needed. You easily adjust the tension by the front knob that controls how hard you need to push back to adjust the back rest like most chairs that recline.Speaking of reclining, this chair reclines pretty far, and is very comfortable.The head rest you will need to fiddle with to make it custom fit for your head. This is the first time I have used a head rest of this type, and surprised at how comfortable it is. Putting the head rest on, while assembling the chair is the hardest part, and its quite easy to do.As some others have said, the seat mesh is a little \"scratchy\", but you get used to it.I have found that I like using a cushion on the seat for extended sitting sessions, but you may not need one. The mesh seat is quite comfortable, and sometimes I switch between using a cushion and sometimes not using one. You will have to see what works for you.One big reason I got this chair is the swing up arms. I prefer these type arms, since you can easily lift them up out of the way, where as other chairs you can't do this. This makes it easy to push in the chair very close to your desk, saving room.Customer Service. One word, OUTSTANDING!I have hard floors at home, and carpet at work. My work place bought me the same chair, so I bought one for home use. I emailed the company and asked about purchasing the roller type wheels for my home chair, and they offered me an additional set for the at work chair, which I didn't need. They were willing to ship me two sets for free! I declined the one for work, since its carpet and didn't need a set. Thats great customer service, which is rare now a days. Keep this in mind when shopping for a chair...there are lots out there, and this company stands behind their product.Assembly - standard for a chair like this, very easy to do, and they provide a simple video to watch. Maybe takes 10 minutes to put together, and you can do it yourself. If you have trouble lifting, you would need some assistance.Shipping - Chair comes very well packed in a sturdy box, no issues there.Quality - I did not have any issues with this chair. Very well put together.Chair options - It leans back pretty far, and with the included head rest, it is quite comfortable to lean back when you are tired for a quick rest, or even a quick, nap. (shhhh...don't tell the boss) You can lock the angle of the back to exactly where you want it, if you don't like having to push back to lean the back rest.So far I am quite happy with this chair. I have never had a full back mesh type chair, and think that this will last quite a while, even with daily use. I think you will be pleased with this purchase. While you may be able to find a similar chair for maybe a little less price, to me, the customer service you get with this purchase is really worth it. You know that they will stand behind your purchase and your being happy with your purchase of their product. I don't think you will be disappointed.*update*Its been 3 months since I purchased this chair and I can tell you 100% no issues with the chair at all. Its quite comfortable, and I would purchase another one, without hesitation. I can be sitting in this chair for long periods of time, with no issues. I do use a small seat cushion, just because I had it left from my previous chair, so might as well make use of it, but its not really needed for this chair. I am completely pleased with this purchase. No chair is perfect, but not being able to get into a chair and sit in it for yourself, shouldn't sway you from purchasing this. Its very comfortable, and even though I am 5'4\", its perfect in size, and the head rest is great too. Easy to lean back when you are tired and take a quick nap. WFH...shhhhhhhhh....!!",

                "reviewText": "Update 7-26-23Jennie and the after sales support from this company is bar none, one of the very best I've ever come across since I've been an Amazon Prime Member for over 15 years.Recently, the headrest broke by accident, so I emailed the company and they gladly accommodated my request for a replacement. Unfortunately, because of a new design in the chair itself, the headrest wouldn't work, as the backrest is different now.. I emailed Jennie and they very quickly are sending me a new backrest to make it all whole again.I couldn't be happier with the chair. It's made with great pride and the support team are always ready to make sure the customers are happy. I highly recommend this chair as it's both comfortable and well designed and if ever you need support, they are always ready to be of assistance in any way possible.Thank you Jennie and the rest of your staff for making things so easy to work with.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++I've spent the better part of two weeks in search of a good chair to replace a 10 year old dilapidated chair that's served me well over the years. I checked out so many chairs on Amazon, local stores and sites like Staples, Office Depot, and others. I even looked on Amazon for Gaming Chairs as they seemed like they would be comfortable. To my dismay didn't find one to my liking.Being an Amazon Prime Member for 14 years now, I continued my search on Amazon. That's when I stumbled upon this GABRYLLY Ergonomic Mesh Office Chair. I read all the reviews and at first was hesitant to purchase it online as was asking myself - 'Oh no! What if I don't like it, how will go about returning such a bulky chair?'I took a leap of faith and went ahead and ordered it online, and was far less expensive than those I saw in local furniture stores and other websites. It arrived in two days as promised, and I was very excited to assemble it, and the first thing that I came to mind was: \"Oh boy, I wonder how long this was going to take me to put it together!\"To my surprise and amazement, it literally took me more time to unbox and take out all of meticulous wrapping which was done to perfection; and assembling the chair was a breeze, just following along the detailed instructions that came with it. I had it done and rolling to my study in about 15 to 20 minutes tops.Upon sitting on the chair for the first time, I knew there and then that I made the right decision in purchasing this office chair. It's super comfortable and the ergonomic design was really to my liking. The headrest was so nice and can easily be adjusted in so many ways. I also like that the armrests can be lifted up and placed out of the way, so that you can roll the chair closer to the table and be in a more comfortable position when typing on the on my various computers :-)The adjustments you can do on the chair was also well though of and such a breeze. For example, I adjusted the tension of how easy it would be to lean back and rock back and forth.Folks, look no further!! This chair fits me to a T!! I am 6\"2' about 155 lbs and the GABRYLLY Ergonomic Mesh Office Chair is super comfortable and the manufacturer went to great length to build this quality chair and paid so much to details, such as the legs where you can place your feet is also testament of how much went into its design. Rotating and rolling back the chair are also very quiet and smooth.In conclusion, as you can see in the photos I've posted, my study/computer room, is my 'Man Cave' as my wife would call it and this chair was a perfect addition, and couldn't be happier.Congrats to those behind the scenes who paid such close attention to details, and made this chair very easy to assemble and extremely comfortable to use.Hope you find this review useful and thanks to all those who have posted their own reviews which helped me in my search for the perfect chair.Thanks and God Bless to all.",
