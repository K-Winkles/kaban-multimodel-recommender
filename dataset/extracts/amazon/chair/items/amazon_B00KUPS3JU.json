                "reviewText": "Hi,I am here to review this chair. I bought it during COVID-19 because I need to work from home now. I am unbiased, no-one has paid me to do this, and I consider myself a generally reasonable human being.This chair cost me roughly $135. It's a chair. I am very happy with it. Putting it together was about as easy as putting together a chair could be, it took me about 15-20 minutes. The instructions consist of 6 steps, read all of them before starting because that's always how you should read instructions (life advice, you're welcome)After constructing this chair, I sat in it, as I planned from the beginning. It feels like a very functional chair. I like that you can lean with it, and rock with it. You can adjust height. I specifically wanted something with arms that folded up, this one has arms that do that. If you are super boujee and the type who requires some ridiculous material and comfort padding, don't buy this, but also nothing will make you happy so maybe you should buy it and just be unhappy. If you're normal and you want a quality computer chair with adequate levels of comfort, folding arms, adjustable height and rocking abilities plus good lumbar support (hopefully most people) buy this chair. It's great. Seriously.I see people nitpicking. This is a $130 computer chair. The material is fine. The comfort does the job. I am beyond happy with this chair and would absolutely recommend it to someone who wants an affordable and functional computer/office chair. If you're a picky scrooge nothing, in all reality, will make you happy - so good luck. I love this chair. Checks all of my boxes. Cheers!PS: Check the date of my review, if I never come back and re-review, its because this chair continued to be a chair and I maintained a high level of happiness with its functionality. I will only ever return to this review if something goes terribly wrong/upsets me that is at the legitimate fault of the chair. Cheers!",

                "reviewText": "Was looking for a new chair to replace my old chair from my set-up. I settled on something cheap since I wouldn't need it for took long and wanted something that was better than the last and good looking.I looked at other chairs and some of them just seemed off, the reviews didn't provide a good feeling so I skipped out on them. But whilst browsing the reviews on this chair I couldn't see anything wrong. Some complaints about squeaky parts, hard to assemble and stuff like that. My first impression since I just got it today is that it is a solid and comfy chair that is also stylish.I got the black frame and white mesh option and it fits in great with my room theme. The overall design is pretty neat with decent support for your back and feels pretty normal size. The armrests on nonadjustable but can go up if you wish not to use them. The putting together of the chair may require some help or nifty way but it's no reason to not buy it. My parts mostly aligned and caused no fuss when assembling. I had the thing put together in about 30 mins with a little help. The instructions aren't the best but it's pretty easy to just use your brain to put it together.The feeling of the mesh is soft and breathable. The cushion is nice and padded, the arm rest are very padded a little more for my liking but that is probably because they are new. Overall I rated it a 4/5, certainly was a little above what I was expecting and was happy with the purchase. Good chair for a decent price.",

                "reviewText": "I've only had this chair for about 2 months now and at the time of purchase, it was $109.19. With that being said, keep in mind that I haven't been able to test out its durability and longevity quite enough. The chairs I've had before this were also within the same price range and weren't that great, so I can't compare it too anything particularly great.This chair is honestly amazing to me. The back mesh allows good air flow and the arc of it really fits the shape of my back extremely comfortably. I'm 5' 8\" and about 160 lbs, so this is based on those measurements in case you need some idea of if it's the right size. I thought I would be bothered without support for my head, but honestly I haven't noticed it for the most part.The leather seat and arm rests are comfortable as well. When I first used the chair, I was a little disappointed by how the seat was just extremely firm, but I think that firmness is actually just right at the point. It gives way just enough to be comfortable, while being firm enough to not make you feel like you're sinking into the seat. The arm rest is similar in this regard. My main issue with the arms is that you can't adjust the height, but its at a good height for me, so it doesn't bother me. The arms are on a swivel that just lets you move them out of the way, similar to how arms move on chairs in airplanes.The assembly was extremely easy. On top of the fact that assembling chairs are easy in general, they offer an extra sense of convenience by labeling all of the screws, covers, etc. By the way, make sure you don't just dump out all of the screws and small parts you're going to use when assembling the chair because then you lose the convenience of the labels. I had absolutely no trouble in the assembly. The only thing was that it seemed like one of the arms push up closer to the back of the chair than the other, but it wasn't too noticeable.As for how smooth the chair rolls around, it's very smooth. It's on top of a low quality plastic mat, so it should move around very smoothly, so I can't really give an accurate idea of just how smoothly it rolls.I highly recommend this chair for anyone looking for an office chair in the low $100 range. You honestly cant go wrong with it. If it ends up being not durable, I'll try to remember to come back to mention that.Edit: I am updating this review on 11/1/2020. I got the chair early May of 2020. I still think this chair is good for the price, but I dropped the review from 5 stars to 3 stars because now the seat itself is not cushioned very well and that is a pretty big deal considering that might be the most important part of the chair. The cushion has squished so much that it barely provides any comfort for my bottom anymore. The rest of the chair is amazing still, but the bottom cushion is certainly not enough to support most people for long periods of time. For reference, I am about 170 lbs, which honestly isn't an unreasonable weight to expect a chair to support for a long time.",

                "reviewText": "The chair is beautiful to look at, and if you are petite (I'm 5'3) it's the perfect height at almost it's lowest setting so it would still be good if you're a little taller. Your legs are at a good 90 degree angle and the waterfall seat allows circulation behind the knees. I tend to sit cross-legged often and the arms don't get in the way. The seat is firm but comfortable and I like that the arms are padded and can be lifted up to tuck under my desk. They are the perfect height for me leaving my elbows bent at a 90\u00b0 angle. The arms are little too far apart from the body though but that's not a deal breaker for me. The lumbar support is not adjustable but hits me at the perfect spot.The reason for the lower rating is because of the price. Like another reviewer, my chair came with the underside of the wheel housing rusty-looking (even though the material is not metal) and it was impossible to get the stains out (maybe I got that chair that they returned). I got an amazon warehouse deal so for what I paid, I decided to keep it as the staining is on the underside of the legs and not visible. The rest of the chair looks great and in great condition. The wheels turn smoothly and it has a good amount of lean back.At $300 though, I would be upset about the staining. I would still give this chair a shot, just look out for the staining and return it if it's there. Otherwise, it's worth it.",
