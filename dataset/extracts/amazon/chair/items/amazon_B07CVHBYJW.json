It is recommended to use a gentler mode of cleaning. Does this rug shed? The faux fur rug itself does NOT shed. But when the new rug is opened, there will be a small amount of floating wool, which is not woven on the carpet. This can make people think the carpet is shedding. How high is the pile on this rug? The pile on this rug is 2.6 inches high. Its faux fur is pretty long. This does not have a sponge layer, why do you say this is a cushion? This faux fur is made of extra-long pile with high density, and its plush has a certain cushioning effect. The no sponge interlayer makes it more versatile and can be used as a cushion, a rug, or a display case decoration. Can I cut this rug into multiple pieces? You can cut our carpet to the size you want with scissors according to your usage needs, it does not affect the usage.",

However, I felt compelled to let customers know these fur coverings can make an inexpensive chair look stylish and classy. They were not vacuum sealed. They came ready to use. Any companies that send me vacuum sealed items I instantly return them. The fur covers shedd a little, but not bad enough for concern. They are huge and it's awesome because they can hang off the edge of the chair. They are also, pretty comfortable considering it's not an actual pad, but cover. Thumbs up from me. The price is not that bad, either.",

The back is sort of a fake version of the back of a real sheepskin and feels like it has enough tooth to it that it won't be sliding off all the time like another faux fur I have on my couch. It is the perfect size to just cover the seat of this chair. (I am attaching pictures that show it just poking out from under my dog's tail and butt.) Happier with this than I expected to be.",
