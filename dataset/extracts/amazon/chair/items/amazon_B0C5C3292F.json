                "reviewText": "Worth the money! I looked at lots of other memory foam chairs, bean bag chairs and read lots of reviews- I settled on buying this chair for my little girls and we love it! My girls already had a bean bag chair at home and now they will only sit in this memory foam chair! Chair comes vacuum sealed in a small bag, after opening it takes 1-2 day to take its full shape.My girls are 1 and 4 years old, they can actually sit in this chair together side by side, chair has lots of room for them to relax in. The chair is strong enough that my girls can even stand on the seat part without falling over. The memory foam keeps its shape. My husband who is 200lbs can also sit in this chair without it losing its shape!Some other things that I also like about this chair is-has a handle on top of the chair to easily carry it around-doesn\u2019t have a weird smell-fabric/material is soft to the touch-the outside fabric/material can be zipped off to easily wash, and inside has Velcro to keep memory foam in place.Would definitely recommend spending the money and buying this chair!",

Very impressed as the price is so much less than competitors including Pottery Barn. I\u2019m so glad I gave it a shot. We got the gray which has a very-very slight purple undertone, but is a true gray.",
