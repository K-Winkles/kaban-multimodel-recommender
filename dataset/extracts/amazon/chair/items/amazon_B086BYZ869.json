It's a nice snug fit too, making my chair feel new again. The material is soft to the touch, and installing it was very easy. The straps on the bottom were a little tricky since are just some loose elastic straps that I guess you're expected to tie into a bow or something. Overall, I'm quite delighted with this product!",

It is also a full back cover.I also added these arm covers with convenient underneath zippers.

At first I was concerned with the thinness of the material, but Ive been using it for a few months now and its still in perfect shape. The amount of stretch is just right, and the material feels nice and soft. I would have loved to give this 5 stars but it did come with a very strong smell. I actually throughout one of my dogs pooped next to my desk at first, it took me a few days to figure out that it was the cover. It literally smelled like baby diarrhea. I gave it a hand wash and the smell only got worse. I had to give it a overnight soak in fabric softener, and that did the trick. Other than that, im very happy with this product, and would still recommend.",
