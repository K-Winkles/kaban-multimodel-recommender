                "reviewText": "I went back-and-forth on this chair. I was concerned about the quality because I saw reviews that said holes didn\u2019t match up, but then I saw a reviewer with the solution. She said to just put the top two screws of the chair back in enough to hold it in place and that would align the bottom two. But aside from that small quirk, which wasn\u2019t a big deal, putting the chair together was SO EASY!! There was literally just four diagrams. It took me 15 minutes tops. The chair is so cool. BIGGG, comfy and sturdy with super durable material. I absolutely love it!! I\u2019m glad I finally got one. For the price point it\u2019s amazing and it arrived a week ahead of schedule.",

                "reviewText": "As someone who is barely 5 feet tall, I have always struggled with desk chairs and not being able to reach the floor, and therefore not be comfortable.As a short girly, I tend to just sit criss-cross applesauce no matter where I am - home, car, or office lol. So this viral chair was an instant buy as it has plenty of room to spread out! I love that it doesn't have arm rests as those usually didn't line up with my height either (even the adjustable ones).The fabric is beautiful and feels high quality. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the fabric seems to not be super taught on the seat cushion, so it wrinkles and moves around a bit, which makes it look cheap.Otherwise, great value and style with comfort!",

I am 5 ft 4, and the chair offers great lumbar support for someone with my proportions.

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars extremely comfy",
                "reviewText": "I\u2019m in love with this chair. It\u2019s extremely comfy and I can sit for long periods of time without any back pain. It\u2019s easy to move around despite having no wheels. I have a plastic chair mat under my desk and it slides across it easily when I need to move it out of the way. I love the height of this chair as well. I am 4\u201911 and most chairs even at their lowest setting my feet don\u2019t fully reach the floor comfortably. Usually my legs are leaned forward or on my toes a bit. However this chair at its lowest setting I can perfectly reach the floor and knees are at the comfiest 90 degree angle.SETUP: The chair was fairly easy to put together. Thankfully I read the reviews or I would\u2019ve been extremely frustrated. The instructions for this are literally 4 steps that make it seem super easy. It is but not because of the instructions. Another reviewer left a video review and said it\u2019s easier to put together if you swap steps 4 and 3 so you can line up the holes on the back with the bottom easier. This is 100% true so thanks for that reviewer!!! I\u2019ll add on - you have to put the back and bottom together at kind of a weird angle to get the holes to line up and start with the back holes first! I can\u2019t even really describe the angle but it feels really wrong. Almost like a wider angle than you think it should ever go. The back of the chair isn\u2019t a 90 degree angle it tilts back a bit. If you can find the angle you\u2019ll get the screws in with very little issue. I put this together by myself in about 5 minutes and 4 of those minutes were figuring out the angle for the back of the chair.CONS: I only have one con really. It\u2019s the angle of the back of the chair. It\u2019s tilted back just a tad too much for me. I like to be able to sit back in my chair and lean into the back but with this one if I do that I can\u2019t type very well. I think if I add a lumbar support pillow I can lean back comfortably. To me, it\u2019s not a huge deal because of the overall comfort and price of this chair. But something worth mentioning.",

Minor hiccups during install because of user error but it was only a few steps and fairly simple. It\u2019s very firm and comfy - if you like leaning back, the up/down level also controls the recline. Took me a bit to figure that out lol. I would buy another in a heartbeat just for the width and the fact that I can sit comfortably on it while working. Thrilled. Also I swapped the wheels out from my old chair.",
