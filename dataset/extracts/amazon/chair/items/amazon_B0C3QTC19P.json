                "reviewText": "I got the cream color in size small, and it fit my IKEA Langfjall chair surprisingly well! I got the chair used and my only gripe was the color, so I was hoping this cover would do the job. I give it 4 stars because I thought the cover would be more opaque, but you can still see the dark gray/black peeking through. Not a huge issue though. I\u2019m thinking about buying some of the other colors so I can switch them around depending on my mood. It was easy to put on since I don\u2019t have the arm rests, so it\u2019s a relief to know that it\u2019ll be easy to take off in the future.",

                "reviewText": "They're cheap, so I guess I can't complain too much. But for my chair, a Haworth, one piece in the set fits over the armrest perfectly, and the other does not. One is about an inch shorter in width than the other. Same length, but different widths. Bad enough that I'm debating whether to order another set in the hopes I get one that is big enough, or try a different brand, because the narrow one just looks terrible as it doesn't wrap around the side of the armrest.The material isn't as soft as I was expecting either. Not bad, kind of a \"smartwool\" feel (it's not smartwool, just going for texture comparison) so while not scratchy, definitely not soft.It has covered up the tear in the armrest vinyl, though, so I guess it's technically doing its job, at least on one side.",

Not the Aeron, nor the Mirra 1 or 2. The elastic is poor and they always slip off. You can literally see through the cover when you hold the fabric up to the light.
