The fabric is soft velvet, good quality and SUPER PRETTY COLOR! (Mine are blush) Sturdy frame, even when all the legs are separated. It was easy to asamble, no complains, i did it by myself in one hour (2 chairs). I had an issue with one of the legs, reported the problem and they immediately answered and solve the problem, in my case they sent me another chair cause there wasn't solution with mine. Super good customer service, they are so polite. I bought also an ottoman footrest, incredible, sturdy and match perfect with the chairs \u2764\ufe0f.I have two months using them, still sturdy. The fabric keeps perfect and soft. I should to say they aren't the most comfortable, but I put some pillows and it's great. Love them!",

I ordered another chair, because I needed one asap and reached out to customer service about the issue with my first order. They responded very quickly and offered me two great options to resolve the issue with my order. The second chair worked perfectly! I received an email stating the issue with my first order would be resolved in 24hrs. Overall I am very pleased with my purchase and how customer service handled everything. I will definitely be recommending this company to my friends and check with them for any future furniture purchases.",
