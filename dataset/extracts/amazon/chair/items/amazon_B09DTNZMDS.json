It\u2019s a bit high for him right now, but he\u2019ll grow into it and it looks like it\u2019ll last him several years.The handle makes transporting it around very simple and easy, and it isn\u2019t too heavy. It\u2019s sturdy enough, though, that my baby can use it to pull himself up and it doesn\u2019t tip over.My hubby did say it wasn\u2019t the easiest to put together, but he got it all set up within 10 minutes.Overall, the chair feels and looks high quality and durable. If you\u2019re on the fence, I say just go for it!",
