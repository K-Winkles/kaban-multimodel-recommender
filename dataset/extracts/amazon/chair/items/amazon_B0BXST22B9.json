This feature allows you to maintain proper alignment during long hours of sitting, reducing strain and fatigue.The seat of the chair boasts a well-balanced design, providing reliable comfort throughout the day. It strikes the perfect balance between firmness and softness, allowing you to breeze through work, gaming, or any focused tasks at your desk without discomfort.One of the standout features of this chair is its adjustable headrest, which is softly padded for added support. You can easily customize the position of the headrest to comfortably rest your head and neck, making relaxation and comfort easily accessible while sitting in the chair.The chair offers two distinct modes for the armrests, adding to its versatility. When the armrests are in the up position, you can sit more freely, cross your legs, or conveniently stow the chair under your desk when not in use.

                "reviewText": "This chair exceeded my expectations by leaps and bounds. So much so that I went back and bought a 2nd one. One black with headrest and one white/beige without headrest. I love them both and they're both fantastic quality. Assembly is probably 20 mins and I assembled both of them by myself. The build quality is really 10/10. Everything is adjustable which is perfect because I'm short and I typically need the lumbar support to be lower than normal. Super comfortable and I never get discomfort or pain sitting in it after long periods of time. The seat is also very wide so I can sit criss cross in the chair comfortably. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",

                "reviewText": "Good looking chair, easy to assemble and is very sturdy when put together. Ergonomics are decent I am 5\u201911 and sit comfortably 6-8hrs a day. Seat bottom has decent padding not sure how it will hold up over time. Limited adjustments kinda make the seat bottom feel shallow and the arm rest could be wider and have thicker padding. Back and head rest are nice and firm and it\u2019s not difficult to recline but again are limited. Overall happy with it for the price but if your looking for something plush with more adjustability consider something different",

                "reviewText": "I will have to agree with the review from Nov 28th.This chair was marketed to seem very high quality, but upon arrival I was fairly disappointed. During building, I noticed that every edge of the plastic had frayed pieces that jutted out and scratched my hands, I had to literally sand the edges down because it was so rough and jagged that sitting against it without sanding would have been extremely uncomfortable. The seat cushion is definitely a bit thinner than I'd like, and the chair is advertised to have tilt, which is slightly misleading, as there is no actual lever to control the forward/backward angle of the back of the chair. The movement of the chair is pretty restrictive, and the base of the seat is wide, but not quite as long as I'd like. As well as while the arm rests do flip up, they are static and rest pretty low and cannot be lifted up. If you have long arms or prefer to have your arms resting higher up, this will be an issue. I like to sit with one leg tucked under the other, and find that the seat doesn't provide enough room to do so comfortably.I will say that the lumbar section has been a significant improvement from the chair I had before this (a secret lab Titan), but I do worry that it won't take very long for my tailbone to hurt due to how thin the seat cushion is, as I often struggle with that with cheaper chairs like this.To summarize:Cons:Cheap materialsRestrictive movementArmrest height cannot be adjustedHead rest sits a bit too far forwardSeat is thinPros:Mesh is comfortableLumbar support is decentSeat is wide, just not longI wouldn't price this chair past 70 dollars honestly. The fact it's over 100 dollars and I had to sand down the parts is extremely disappointing. Definitely misleading advertising and reviews. I'm 5'3 and 180 pounds, so perhaps someone who's lighter weight may have a better experience than I do, but I personally wouldn't recommend this chair unless the above issues are addressedUpdate: it's been 3 days and unfortunately my concern has indeed become an issue. Not only does my tailbone hurt with this chair, but my thighs are also struggling quite badly with the way my legs naturally rest in this chair. Every time I stand up, I feel like I've been doing squats for hours, and I've been really doing my best to make sure I am sitting at proper height with proper posture and keeping my feet flat on the ground. I definitely do not recommend this chair for anyone who needs to sit for more than 20 minutes.",
