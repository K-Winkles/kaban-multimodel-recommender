                "reviewText": "Let me start off by saying this chair is far beyond what I expected it to b. I got this chair because I'm redoing my room and I wAnted a cheap alternative to a small couch. This chair is the perfect thing. The one thing I would suggest is maybe getting a footrest or something to put ur feet on if like to sit with your feet up and leaning back (like me;)).THE FUR- so I just wanna say, when I ordered this I expected the fur to be poor quality fur that matted together from sweat and sitting on it. On the contrary it's super soft and seems like it would be really easy to clean. The fur has no smell, nor does it get gross if u sit on it for a long time.THE SIZE- so when I was thinking of buying a saucer chair, I wanted a big that I would be able to curl up in. I stuck with this one. It's the perfect size. You can't really curl up in it, but it's super cozy and big enough to have room to sit on your side and lean all the way back. It's not too low but it's low enough that u can stretch you feet out on the floor and still be comfortable for an average 5 foot and up height. Little kids can curl up in and my siblings love to read in it. Another plus is the folding. Whenever I need the space i can just fold it and put it away and my room looks bigger. It's super convenient.THE LOOK- so this saucer chair is perfect for a bedroom, dorm room, living room, etc. It gives off a sleek look and doesn't look cheap at all, which is a big plus, since it was pretty cheap :). My dad loves this chair so much he's thinking of buying some more for the whole house! (I got it for my room)All in all, i think this is a wonderful buy you can't go wrong with. If you're looking for something to cozy up in this is the perfect chair. It's cheap cute convenient and super comcortable.UPDATE- so I have been using this chair for just a week and I love it but after constant use for abt three days the fur ripped from the top. It's no biggie I'm just gonna see it back but I'm taking off one star for that. Obviously not so good for big people since I only weigh 110 pounds.",

                "reviewText": "Don't get it twisted, the chair was fantastic...for about a month. Then it, literally, felt apart under me. I only used this chair for one thing, to sit in. Unfortunately, it only made it one month. I was about 280lbs at the time, and even then, I didn't really sit in this thing like that and not for any extended period of time.Good news is, the chair felt amazing to sit in. The material was nice and cozy and I believe I took a quick nap in it once because I was so comfortable. It made for a wonderful chair in my room and my guests loved it when we watched movies or played games. One thing they didn't like was the inability to eat in the chair due to the chair's incline. Given the material, I'm glad no one felt inclined to eat in the chair, or else I may have had to deal with stains and crumbs all the time. So that's a plus for me.However, take note that this material will make you hot and your legs sweat if you sit in it with or without pants, respectively. Although it isn't super thick faux fur, there's enough there to raise your butt's temperature a few degrees.Ultimately, it was good while it lasted. I can't think of a way to improve the longevity other than using a different material for the legs. But I'm not a chair scientist, so I'm not exactly sure what caused the frame to give out after only a month of occasional use. Be that as it may, the price tag fits.",

                "reviewText": "I actually love this chair. For $60, it\u2019s adult sized and genuinely comfy. Not much booty room though so if you have some behind maybe steer clear. I almost wish it would tilt back a bit more and this might not be as much of a problem. Either way, I love the build and softness and that it folds up. I am considering getting another one for my roommate since my cats claimed this one 2 minutes after I set it up the first time.Only negative was that the box it came in was all but destroyed and opened by the time it got to my door. Seller may need to package it more securely in future!!",

El asiento est\u00e1 cosido con unas tiras de tela alrededor del armaz\u00f3n y no puede quitarse sin descoserlas y volverlas a coser.",
