                "reviewText": "I saw a chair like this on TikTok but really didn\u2019t want to buy anything from there- luckily everyone in the comments was saying you could get the same thing on Amazon! This was the highest rated listing I found. Not only was it less expensive and free shipping, but it looks exactly like the ones I was seeing. Very comfortable, sturdy and looks nice. It was pretty easy to put together, though I needed an extra set of hands when aligning the backrest and seat. Happy with my purchase!",

                "reviewText": "This was the perfect upgrade I needed. This chair is so comfortable and relaxing. I thought it was incredibly soft and has outstanding material for the padding and exterior. It was super easy to assemble. There are four steps with eight screws. The third step is the hardest because you have to align the holes of the bar attached to the backrest and the holes on the bottom of the seat. Once you get the first screw in though, it\u2019s smooth sailing after that. It took me max 10 minutes to assemble and indulge in some relaxation. The only issue that I have overall is that I wish the seat was longer. Its width is perfect but it could be longer. Overall, this is a fantastic chair and I will be significantly more comfortable while I study.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m 5\u2019 8, 275 pounds. While I cannot cross my legs in it (still slightly too small for such) it\u2019s definitely a good size for sitting without feeling like I\u2019m riding a bike on one of those tiny little desk chairs. Now I will admit this chairs predecessor was a large multi hundred dollar big and tall chair so I have extremely high expectations for what I need in a chair as I\u2019m a editor and need to sit for hours at a time. However, this chair is aesthetically pleasing and much more minimal- which looks better in our bedroom.If design is a concern, this is it. It\u2019s firm, but still comfortable. A great task chair for the price. But if you\u2019re looking for an amazing comfortable chair, this is not it- but this was not designed to be that. If you\u2019re looking for a chair to do hours and hours of computer work on a regular basis, then go to a local office supply store and buy yourself a big girl chair. If you\u2019re looking for a budget friendly and very attractive chair for a work space to spend minimal time at here and there, this is good.Also- for context, my husband is 6\u20195- 350 pounds. He also approves of the chair.So does my cat. Large cat for size comparison.",

                "reviewText": "I received my package earlier than expected- it did arrive in its original box and not in an amazon box, so beware if thieves are common where you are; everyone knew what I purchased because the box had an image of the chair and in big letters \"office chair.\"Set up took maybe 30-35 minutes and assembly was easy. I read some reviews from people who had a hard time installing the seat, so maybe that expectation softened the blow, but it was simple for myself.The seat itself is wide and has decent back support for what I am looking for. I can sit comfortably with my legs crossed and still have some room. The height adjustment is incredibly smooth. My only concern over time is the base and wheels. The chair has the option to use the wheels or go without, which I do appreciate.I will give an update if something does go awry, but fresh out of the box, I would recommend anyone to purchase this chair. It shipped quicker than expected, simple to assemble and turned out to be very comfy.",

For those having trouble lining up the holes, you really have to shove the two pieces together. It makes sense when you are doing it. This is where having two people would be helpful because one person could be pushing down and the other could be tightening the screws, but I was still able to do it by myself. The fabric wrinkles a bit where you sit but not a deal breaker. Like I said, good for the price! The color gray is very accurate to the pictures",
