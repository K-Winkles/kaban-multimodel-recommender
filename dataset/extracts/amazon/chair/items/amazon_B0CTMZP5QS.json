It\u2019s more than wide enough, and while a bit firm it\u2019s more in a supportive than uncomfortable way. I find it easier to sit in for hours than my much more thickly cushioned chair. The cushion does indent a bit after a bit of use, so if you want it to keep that crisp straight line for aesthetic reasons, be aware of that. It also cleans up very well, which our cats have thoroughly tested. They seem to really like it, too. Overall, I\u2019m very tempted to order another when my chair finally gives out and match his.",

                "reviewText": "I LOVE this chair. I waited for a few months and kept researching to decide on which one I wanted. I couldn't bring myself to spend $200+ on this style so I was very excited when I found this one that looked very comfy at a great price point. I still see a chair like this on tiktok and buzzfeed that's over $200 with a much thinner seat. This one is way more comfortable, most likely!!I put it together myself and it only took fifteen minutes or so. Would have been quicker with another person to help hold the top piece in place while I put the bottom on and screwed it in (I used an electric screwdriver with a hex bit instead of the little Allen wrench it came with), but I basically leaned all my weight on the bottom to push it into place, felt around for the screw holes and screwed them in by hand enough that they held the bottom on and then just finished with the screwdriver. It's definitely very comfortable. The bottom cushion is VERY thick. It does compress throughout the day, so by the end of my work day it's not as fluffy as it is in the morning, but it's (I'm assuming) memory foam so that expected. It's right back up to max fluffy the next morning. I love sitting with one or both legs bent/sitting on my feet, so this is perfect for my home office. I thought I'd dislike the lack of wheels, but it really doesn't bother me at all. It's easy enough to shift here and there when I need to, and the feet have thick felt pads so it doesn't scratch the floor (which would be a big problem for me if it did, since I rent).I will say, I have several new pairs of black leggings and the seat seems to be a bit discolored from the dye in the leggings, but it doesn't bother me. I haven't tried cleaning it. Worst case if it happens to you and it bothers you, Amazon sells covers for computer chairs that would probably fit this, or just put a pillow or a blanket over the seat.I'm seriously considering buying another one for my desk at the office (I work hybrid). I'll never go back to a chair with arms for my home office though!!",

I figured that I can just lift it to move it in and out from under my desk as I work. I didn't take into consideration how heavy the chair is.
