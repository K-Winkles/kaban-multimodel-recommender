                "reviewText": "Did a lot of searching for a good chair in my house after hip replacement surgery. I\u2019m only 37 years old, experienced some trauma, got a bionic hip. Our furniture is cute, but not practical/comfy. We\u2019re not much for lounging. However, I\u2019m now in need of comfort and support, and am sick of being stuck alone in bed. These chairs came today, my 12 and 14 year old kids put them together for me, super easy. Thumbs up! My husband tested the chair with some solid sit-downs, and then I put it to the test. It was a solid sit. Not too far to go down before resting. Cushions were surprisingly supportive and cushy. I felt good. I cried, for-real tears. It\u2019s been weeks beyond weeks since I\u2019ve sat with my family, not confined to my bedroom. After a while of sitting I was exhausted and ready for bed, but felt good all things considered. Time for the standing up test. Nervously, I grabbed on to my walker, kicked my leg out and prepped for takeoff. And I stood. Not too far to go up to get up! Wonderful! I\u2019m hoping to heal before I get too comfortable sitting down all day, boy I miss standing. Thankful for these chairs. It\u2019s the little things.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased these chairs as my office guest chairs. They were easy to assemble by myself, however, I did have to prop the items on a table when I was assembling the bottom cushion to the legs. The cushions are thick enough and the material is soft. I've had several people sit in them so I know it can hold someone who's 300 lbs. I don't know how long they will last, I guess it depends on how often they're used. But overall, I got a bargain. The price was very reasonable for some great chairs. I recommend this product.",
