They were the exact same chairs. At this price I didn't mind that I had to buy all four. I will donate the other two to my daughter who never has enough chairs.There's enough cushion that they are comfortable to sit in for long periods of time. They are very sturdy for my 3 year old and 5 year old grandkids. They are relatively lightweight, but the way the legs angle out give it extra stability. They are super easy to keep clean, even the white ones. Assembly was super easy. My husband had all of them put together in about 20 minutes.If you like the looks of these chairs, you will love the durability of them.",

                "reviewText": "These exceeded my expectations for their price point\u2014the lowest price point you\u2019ll find. They are very sturdy, gorgeous chairs. The pad isn\u2019t as comfortable and soft as I had hoped, but the chair structure makes up for it and it\u2019s not UNcomfortable by any means\u2014just the pad is a little hard. These will be so easy to clean. All surfaces are easy to wipe. And some of the reviews said it\u2019s hard to clean around the pad, you can unscrew the pad from the chair and clean underneath it. A little bit of extra work, but better than it not unscrewing at all.Installation was super easy (especially if you have a drill). Comes with extras, especially extra felt pads. Manufacturer stickers come off super easy with no residue. I did have issues with two of the eight chairs with the center screws. On one, the center screw wouldn\u2019t catch or tighten at all. The other would only tighten a little bit then suddenly be loose again. For both I just used the extra longer screws and made sure I only tightened them to the edge of the wood so not to puncture the chair, and that fixed the problem. The washers jingle a little on those chairs, but it doesn\u2019t look like it affects the integrity of the chair at all.We got these to replace some tall back leather ones that kept cracking, wobbling, and breaking when you leaned back in them. These will definitely not have that issue, they\u2019re so solid. My husband and I are both 200+ lbs and they don\u2019t move or make any noise when we sit in them. I also like the little lip on the back almost like a handle. I hated having to use two hands to move my old chairs to keep them from scratching the floor or loosening even more and they were heavy\u2014these ones are so light and easy to move.I\u2019ll update this review if they fail in any way, but these seem like solid chairs and I\u2019m so happy I found them. Can\u2019t beat that price for 8 of them!",

I wouldn\u2019t say they are meant to sit in for hours at a time, but they\u2019re perfect for sitting at the table to eat my meals. The little cushion on the chair definitely helps, but I noticed if I\u2019m sitting there longer than an hour it starts to get a little uncomfortable. Would still recommend because they are well made and sturdy.",
