It folds out into a nice nap time bed, too.I didn't realize I would appreciate this until my daughter played on the couch, bit the attached side \"arms\" is amazing. So many couches I saw were more modular, and I can see those pieces flying when a toddler played on it. I highly recommend this! My sister got one for her two kids and they love it too.",
