                "reviewText": "A different height and back support from my old desk chair, so at first I kind of hated it. After using it a while, I love it. I am on the shorter and smaller side (5'3\"), so it fits me perfectly. If you're a taller person I can imagine this would not work well for you as your shoulders would likely rise above the back support.I bought this for two reasons: Aesthetic and material. I'm extremely pleased with both.The aesthetic is gorgeous. I wanted the ivory one but was worried about staining and/or discoloration over time, so I settled for the brown-with-white and it's still a beautiful chair, I love the look of it. It suits my cottagecore/rustic room better than my old chair.My old chair was black plastic with mesh material as the seat/back, and it got crumbs and hair and all kinds of stuff stuck in it. I wanted a chair with a solid seat that would be easy to clean and that I could rest my legs up on without pressing little hole imprints all over my skin. This chair does that. I realize that's not the highest of standards, but despite my low and niche requirements, I do think this chair is WELL worth the money for most people. Despite the cost, the material looks and feels quality and the whole unit is well made and stitched beautifully together. The visible stitching adds to the look, in my opinion. While I wasn't expecting much quality for the price, this chair far exceeded my expectations.The back of this chair is not particularly ergonomically supportive, but I didn't absolutely need that, and for the price you can easily buy your own separate back-support cushion. The way the seat is designed I imagine most would fit well on it. Despite the lack of back support, it's a comfortable chair to sit on for hours. The seat remains cushy and comfortable all day, you don't start feeling lumps or hard spots like I have on some other chairs.It was easy to assemble (half hour at most?), instructions were clear. The tilt and height adjustments work perfectly for me. I love this chair and highly recommend for anyone average height or shorter.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very nice chair. Well built, very comfortable and easy to put together. I put it together during a halftime of a football game. I've been sitting in it for three days now and it's been quite comfortable. Very sturdy and adjustable. A great value!12/02/23Update: I had problems with the control mechanism plate that mounts to the bottom of the chair. Broken weld. I contacted Neo Chair and they were very quick to send replacement plate and adjustable shock after I sent them pics of the damaged part. They were great to work with and stand by their products. I was quite impressed with their concern and fast response on making things correct. A fantastic company to deal with and they have earned a customer for life. I will be buying all my chairs from them from now on and tell all my friends how great Neo Chair is. A welcome surprise for this day and age!",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the NEO CHAIR Office Chair, and overall, it's a solid addition to my home office. The adjustable features make it comfortable for long work sessions, and the mid-back design provides adequate support. The PU leather adds a touch of elegance, enhancing the overall aesthetic.However, I noticed a minor issue with the chair's stability. It tends to rock slightly when I shift my weight, which can be distracting during intense work moments. Additionally, the arm supports, while comfortable, could be sturdier. There is a noticeable give when pressure is applied, making me cautious about putting too much weight on them.Despite these concerns, the chair's ergonomic design and comfort level earn it a solid four stars. It assembles easily, looks great, and the adjustable features are a definite plus. With a bit of improvement in stability and arm support durability, this NEO CHAIR could easily reach five-star status.",

                "reviewText": "Very good Product Support - After having this chair for a few weeks, I noticed the top bolt cover on the right arm of the chair would become loose & pop off. I put it back on a few times and it popped off again, and I noticed the bolt it was covering would also become loose and have to be tightened and re-tightened.I contacted support and noticed they got back to me immediately and requested that I send them photos of the problem, so they could assist. After contacting them I noticed that the bolt cover was somehow causing the bolt to become loose when the cover was on, and resolved the problem of the bolt getting loose by leaving the bolt cover off. After leaving the cover off I've noticed the bolt stays tight without any further problem. Wanted to mention this here as a solution for anyone else that may have noticed the same problem.Very pleased with this chair that is a good office chair as well as comfortable to lounge in. For example you can loosen the tilt control which makes it like a rocking chair. Comes with good instructions, good-fitting parts and is quite easy to assemble.I'm not the most mechanically inclined person around but I do my best to put things together if I need to do so, and I will admit that most the time, if it's possible to put something together completely backwards I usually do just that, then curse a lot about how badly the item was made, but with this I found the instructions very straight forward and helpful, and was able to put the chair together correctly the first time without any problems.",
