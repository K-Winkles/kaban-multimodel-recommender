I SUCK at building things and usually give up after 5 minutes, but this is the first thing i have been able to put together by myself. The chair is so cute and looks amazing in my office. Comfort level for this chair is probably a 7-8 out of 10. I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to sit in it for 8 hours but for the amount of time I\u2019m in the chair it\u2019s perfect!",

No less than three different finish colors, and the wheels are exceptionally bad. It feels like a bad toy product finish, not an adult chair. This chair requires you to pay for shipping if you want to return it. Spare yourself the expense. It will cost me more to try to somehow make it better by adding different type wheels, and maybe spray paint the hardware.",
