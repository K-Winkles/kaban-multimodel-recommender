Assembly wasn\u2019t too bad at all and didn\u2019t require me to get any other tools myself. The headrest is nice to have when I\u2019m frustrated with work and lean back in a huff too! It\u2019s a nice cushion and is overall comfortable.It was a bit shorter than I was expecting, and a bit narrower in the seat. It also feels like the seat leans a little bit forward in the front, and I thought I maybe put it together incorrectly, but I think that\u2019s just how it\u2019s designed.Overall, I like the chair and I\u2019m happy with the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "The pillow in the lower back of the chair offers great support. It is more comfortable than the chair I have at work that cost close to $400. The pillow in the small of your back feels so good after sitting for several hours. My husband bought these chairs for his friends to use for poker games. I may have to \"borrow\" one for my desk at home! They roll great. My husband had some issues with putting them together as the screws that held the arms to the seat did not fit good. They had to be screwed into the seat because of the threading. Otherwise, they are well worth the money.",

I believe that the base that attaches to the seat bottom is messed up in some manner. Bent would be my guess. All in all, it seems like a decent investment.",
