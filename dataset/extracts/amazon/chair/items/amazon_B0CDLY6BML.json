                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Takes some getting used to, but performs as advertised",
                "reviewText": "I was having some back paid due to various issues including poor posture. I work a desk job from home for 8+ hours every day (as is likely true for most people in the market for an ergo chair), so I was very excited to have this chair delivered.Assembly was simple and straightforward, and all of the necessary components were included in the box. They even included extra screws -- just in case -- which was a welcome sight. In all, it took about 20 minutes to assemble.Once assembled, I'll be honest in saying that I was initially underwhelmed. I'm not sure what I was expecting exactly, but I couldn't shake the feeling that the chair wasn't particularly comfortable. I attempted to adjust the lumbar support component to each of its 3 vertical settings, but still couldn't find that Goldilocks position that I had built up in my head. I had strongly considered requesting a refund, but I decided to try it for at least a full work day before taking that step. What I realized is that this chair isn't meant to be comfortable, at least not in the conventional sense. After all, comfort (at least as I knew it) was generally the result of poor posture. And since this chair actively encourages you to sit with proper posture, my body immediately rejected the idea.In short, this product requires the user to take an active role in their posture and physical health. It's not something that will cure what ails you on its own. Rather, it's an incredibly effective TOOL that assists the user in fixing their posture.And it works extremely well.I've been using the chair every day for a couple of weeks now, and I've noticed that my posture is much better, even when I'm NOT using this product. That's the true value proposition of this product.As far as product features, I rather enjoyed the fully adjustable nature of the arms. It's actually the main reason I purchased this chair over others in the market, and they perform well as expected. In addition to adjusting up and down (which is seen in most products), the arms actually adjust forward and backward, as well as on a rotational pivot inward or outward to suit your needs.The headrest works as expected, but I personally found that I prefer to leave it off. The good news is this is easily accomplished and looks just as clean and polished as if you were to leave it on.So why only 4 stars? I can only think of two mildly critical things to say about this product:1.) While the lumbar support does have 3 adjustment settings that toggle position up and down the back of the chair, I found myself wanting some setting that could adjust the intensity of the support. It's a very sturdy support component, but sometimes I wish it was just slightly less dramatic.2.) I was lucky to purchase this product on sale, and am generally happy with the price point I received. However, for as well as this product works, I can't say I would recommend it at its full MSRP. Again, not necessarily a knock on the product, but my metaphorical socks need to be thoroughly knocked off to justify a $300 office chair. This one falls just short.If you can find this product on sale, and are prepared to take an active role in your posture and spine health this is a solid buy. If you're looking for a product that's going to solve all your problems for you, this one may not be for you.",

                "reviewText": "Score of 4. The lumbar support is low if I sit up straight (female height of 5\u20193\u201d). Also the plastic HANDLE for the seat-height lift and backrest recline feature is toooooo difficult to set-up, the iron stick is very hard to insert into the plastic handle. I almost wanted to return the Gabrylly ergonomic office chair (model # 5000A-3D color white). Other parts, easy others are heavy to assemble, with a user manual guide. A step by step procedure is printed with pictures and arrow direction. A big plus, screws are packed and labeled separately. The backrest, lumbar support and headrest are made of mesh. Armrests are adjustable in height but cannot be tilted up. Be careful, because it is too heavy (39.7 lbs) if wish to return. By mistake, I ordered seat with cushion, armrests that cannot be tilted up. Other gabrylly model, the seat, backrest/lumbar support and headrest are all made of mesh with armrests that can tilted up too. Overall I like the chair!!!",
