Smooth, clean, geometric shapes are essential. Upholstered furniture often wears black, white, or other neutral tones, using the natural fibers found in wool, cotton, linen, silk, jute to add textural appeal. Rustic/Industrial Industrial design is great for people who do not want a cluttered home. Industrial d\u00e9cor lends itself to a sleek, organized arrangement. It provides a reclaimed feel to your home with a sophisticated comfort. If you are looking to shake up your industrial style, add blooming plants or soft textured rugs to your space. Mid Century Modern Most Mid-Century modern homes showcase three predominant characteristics: a clean, minimalist aesthetic, an emphasis on bringing the outdoors in, and the presence of angular structures. The minimalist aesthetic is a connection to Scandinavian minimalism and the incorporation of natural materials is a core feature that fuels its following. Glam Glam design is where luxury meets sophistication in a glitzy decor scheme that seduces the senses. It feels very luxurious and elevated with mirrored furniture, rich fabrics, and metallic accents combined to create a look that plays on the extravagant. Imagine chandeliers with cascades of crystals glittering against tufted furniture draped with faux furs.",

No matter how \"ergonomic\" (expensive) they all tend to be crap. Thought I'd try this one . . . and wow! It's excellent. I work at a desk for 8-10 hours a day. This is super comfortable. Great lower back support. My feet touch the floor. And, it looks great in my home office. Nice enough to use as an extra chair at the dinner table if need be. It's just a simple, well designed, reasonably priced chair with no BS. Love it!",

I was little disappointed that one of them arrived without hardware, so I had to improvise and use the extra bolts from other chairs and just run to hardware store to get 5 washers I needed. Also, 3 out of 8 chairs had and issue with threading for one of the screws and I was unable to fully screw one of them in. So, chair is little wobbly and if feels like one leg is longer than others. I unfortunately threw away all of the papers that came with the chairs, so I was unable to reach out to the manufacturer directly. But still a great buy for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I'll echo the other very positive comments about this eye-catching chair. First, it has Nordic-style good looks. The beautifully curved seat and legs and floating, hemispherical back are just about as perfect as it gets aesthetically. (The style is evocative of an Eames chair.) Second, this chair is made entirely of natural wood and the finishing is remarkably refined for this price point. The walnut stain is just about perfect (both color-wise and in its uniformity). The charcoal fabric is simple and understated. The feet have silicon sliders that will not scratch wood floors. Third, this is an exceptionally easy chair to put together. Just one bolt to join the x-shaped legs together and four more to attach them to the seat. We had both of our chairs assembled in 12 minutes. The chairs are very efficiently packed in easy-to-carry boxes (and are surprisingly light). There was absolutely no transit damage at all - not even a minor scratch. Finally, and most importantly, the chairs are strong and rigid and very comfortable to sit in. I'm actually astonished that such good quality, beautifully-designed chairs are available at this price point. If you're considering this chair, go ahead and purchase with confidence. I can certainly attest to the high rating here on Amazon.",

The person using the chair weighs 185 lbs so it's certainly not a weight issue! I've reached out to the company and am waiting for a favorable response. Once I get a response, I will update this review.I rated the chair 3 stars on assembly because if you purchase the rotating element that is suggested at purchase, be prepared to struggle with the installation. I had one of my carpenters assemble it and even with his professional skillset it was still a struggle to assemble. Things didn't line up, etc.Finally, I'm giving it a ONE STAR on comfort. While it is a cute chair, it is NOT AT ALL comfortable!!!! It's made for a small person with a small behind!!! Anything bigger than a woman's size 12 will find this chair uncomfortable! My son is 6'2\" and weighs 185 lbs. He can fit in this chair, but mom and dad can't. Definitely made for a small framed person! Had I known that I wouldn't have made the purchase.",

The look-a-likes are all sections which spoils the affect.I also added the Fasmo barstool swivel, as per another reviewer the holes line up perfectly. We did have to purchase four screws to get the correct length. I suggest doing the same if using as a desk chair.Well worth the price in quality alone.",

The upholstery fabric on the back (the arched part) should have been stretched tighter. In 4/6 chairs I bought, I can see crinkling ; there's nothing to do.2. Legs are a bit uneven which make the chairs unstable (slightly rock). But once you sit on, it's stable. No rocking.Crinkles bother me more than slight instability. Yet not enough to send them back. 3.5/5 is my rating.",
