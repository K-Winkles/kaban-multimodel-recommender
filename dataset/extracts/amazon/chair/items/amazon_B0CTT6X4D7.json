But other than that I love it and would recommend to anyone! Oh and I can't forget to mention assembly was a breeze. It took us 5 minutes to get it out of the box and connect the two pieces together.",

It is a little bit more narrow than I thought, however, I still feel like I have room to move around in it as well as my husband. We are both 5\u20193 and 5\u20196. It does recline a little slow for me but I don\u2019t mind that. It\u2019s sturdy and I do not see this material getting dirty easily! I love the color. Overall, it\u2019s definitely the best one in our budget. I highly recommend it! I can\u2019t wait to rock our baby in it soon!",

The manufacturer did a great job on this chair and the price is wonderful too. M McCoy, PA",

The seat is pretty firm but comfortable. The recliner aspect may loosen up after more use but at this time, it is a bit of a challenge to recline and keep it in a reclined position. Rightening it is an effort as well. For the price, I\u2019m pleased.",

                "reviewText": "This Rocking Chair Nursery Swivel Rocker Recliner comes in a very large box. I had the delivery person leave it near the front door where I broke down the box and brought in the two pieces separately. Most of the weight is in the base of the chair and it is very heavy for one person. Two people can make quick work of getting the base inside and placed where you want it. Connecting the top piece is just a matter of lining it up with the base and pushing hard till it clicks into place.I am five feet, four inches tall and when sitting all the way back in the chair my feet do not hit the ground. If I want to use the chair as a rocker I just place a pillow behind my back. When reclining my feet don\u2019t fall over the edge of chair which makes it very comfortable to recline in. Closing the recliner takes a little more effort because you do need to back kick it back into locking position.I love the gray color and the fabric is nice, not at all scratchy. There is a bit of a new chair smell that quickly dissipates.",
