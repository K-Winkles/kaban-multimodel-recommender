                "reviewText": "This would be a 4.5 star if it was an option. The cost to get what this offers is so much cheaper than commercial grade ones, but just know a couple of these issues below-The washers it comes with are terrible, you will want to not even use them-You will need to tighten screws with Allen wrench every few uses-The design to increase/decrease angle is always preferred to be like this where you don't have to screw an unscrew anything, but it makes it slightly less stable-The pad caps are pretty funky, they stick out as some other pictures have shown.HOWEVER, definitely still got to give 5 stars. the ankle pad design where it flips up instead of just being locked in is so perfect. The hip pads are REALLY firm, I would almost prefer them to be a little squishier but they will last longer and are better for the exercises. Everything is metal. Also I am 220 pounds, stockier build so people who weigh less will probably have basically no wobble, and even I have very little wobble like very very little so I could see people who weigh quite a bit more than me being able to use this.Just tighten the screws regularly and don't use the washers and this is the perfect roman chair for the price.",

                "reviewText": "Metal is solid, all the holes lined up, clear directions, even the hardware is labeled for each step. And it went together without a problem.There are 3 issues to consider:1. The main issue is the two pads that you rest your pelvic area on are very close together leaving almost no room for your testicles or your shaft so everything is smashed up. This might not be a issue with every guy. I\u2019m able to reposition at the beginning of each set to where it\u2019s bearable.2. Although the metal is strong, the entire thing is just flimsy when doing dips. It does just fine for hypertensions, but wobbles around when doing dips.3. In addition to being wobbly during dips it\u2019s also a little too small for doing dips. My knees just touch the ground at the bottom of my rep. I\u2019m 6\u2019 tall.With that being said, it folds up nice and the wheels are nice for moving it around.I think for the price and storage size you won\u2019t get any better.So if you don\u2019t have room for a bigger non-folding dip bar, I would get this.If your mainly concerned about doing hyperextensions this thing will do. The dip bars are nice for getting on and off the machine.Just have to watch the testes.",

The directions were very easy to understand, and all the nuts and bolts are kitted, so you don't have to figure out which washers go with which bolts. The chair is very well made, and very sturdy. It sets well on our floor, and we are able to fold it up quickly and roll it away for storage if needed. My husband and I both use it to strengthen our core muscles. My husband weighs 190 lbs.

It's heavy enough to inspire confidence, but light enough to easily fold up and wheel into a corner when not in use. I'm surprised that they don't show this in the images or video, but it does stand up on it's own when folded away. You just have to be carful of your floors because of the metal edge on the foot plates. If they added some rubber to those it would be perfect. I might do that myself.",

                "reviewText": "I'm 6' 2\", 200lbs (91kg) so am keen that anything I buy to carry my weight, plus more, is solid and well built.When this arrived I was firstly impressed by how lovingly packaged and laid out in its box this was. All parts are numbered sequentialy with clear instructions for construction, that come with it, in an A4 size booklet. Following the instructions exactly, the machine takes shape easily and with minimum fuss.Each part is well made and well finished and the end result is very pleasingly heavy and strong, comparing favourably with any other home gym equipment I have had in the past. Most gyms I have been to don't seem to have Roman Chairs these days due to Health and Safety and the potential for easy back injuries if they are not used appropriately.On this subject I would recommend researching how to use the Roman Chair thoroughly on YouTube. There are many videos, featuring all levels of ability, available for free, with advice from career professionals. this being said, the first thing I found out was that everything I thought was wrong and, fortunately I started using it correctly from the start, thanks to the available guidance..If I had jumped in and just got on to it, in addition to wasting my energy, I could have hurt myself.It is fully adjustable and takes my weight easily in all positions. It folds away to about the size of a large ironing board. It's smart and will certainly last for a very long time. For the money, I think this is an absolute bargain. It usually takes me a long tome to get round to writing feedback about my purchases on Amazon. Weeks, even months, go by but I only got this a couple of days ago and, perhaps due to endorphins from home exercising this afternoon, I feel compelled to recommend this to anyone who is hesitating about whether this is any good. It is. I'm happy and am looking forward to having glutes like cannonballs, a washboard stomach and grapefruit shoulders. All I have to do now is put in the necessary, countless, hours of work to get them.",
