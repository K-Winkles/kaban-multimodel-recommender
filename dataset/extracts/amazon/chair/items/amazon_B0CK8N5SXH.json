                "reviewText": "DISCLOSURE: I returned the chair for personal reason -- it is an excellent chair. I ordered the chair to replace my old home office chair. Within hours of placing the order, a friend indicated they had two of these chairs and I was welcome to one. Can't beat free! The chair seats wonderfully, it is firm but not uncomfortable. The coasters are good, not at all difficult to maneuver around in. The chair my friend gave me was still in the box. The assembly was super easy and not at all time consuming. It is the perfect size for my small office area.",
