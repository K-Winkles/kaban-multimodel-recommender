                "reviewText": "My disclosures:I am NOT good with maintenance, assembling and other issues.I am not a fan of 3rd party sellers.My fears:Buying from a 3rd party seller is something I avoid at all costs. My fear here was, I purchase a chair that is not comfortable, and I end up having to return it. $30 shipping fee PLUS whatever it would cost to return an oversized box to California. At least $45-60 to return an item that is not acceptable? No thanks.I feared the chair would not be comfortable. I need a chair that has good lumbar support.I also feared I would have to pay someone to assemble the chair. It's been close to 30 years since I've assembled an office chair.Reality:The reason I chose to give this chair and seller a chance, is it was an Amazon Choice product (whatever that means). But, it was of some \"comfort\" if nothing else. Then the next reason I went with it, the summary of ratings on comfort. Yes, I know, fake reviews. Yeah, but, you gotta have some trust in some things. Besides, if it's an average rating in one area, and fake ratings get in, I figure they get in on all, so, the average works great. This chair was rated at 4.2 for comfort.The end results:Chair is very comfortable (which, by the way is very subjective) . The bonus of the vibrating lumbar pillow helps. More on this later.I wanted a chair that had padded arm rests. Lately for some unknown reason to me, my left elbow gets a sharp pain when pressed against even a sofa. The padded arm rests help alleviate this (so far anyway).The assembly was mostly pretty easy. Even for an assembly ignorant such as myself. Sure, I had a few issues. The footrest, for example, I was unsure which way was correct, as it seems rather clumsy and clunky to pull out and have to flip. I'm used to a footrest you pull out and use. After trying the other way, I realized that would be worse. So I returned it. I won't be using it anyway. I'm at work to work, not take a nap. Right?BUT, some people work and game from home- so, I tested it. I'm not overly huge. 5'10 175, and, I felt the footrest would barely support me. Seemed weak to me. Maybe tighter screwing of the screws? Maybe not. NOT my favorite feature of the chair.The footrest attachment arms seemed to get in the way of the levers. So, I was unsure of that. But, once assembled, they do not even come in to play.The directions warn to not tighten the screws before assembling. So, I did not. As a result, I did not have alignment issues at all.Overall, assembly was pretty simple; even I was able to do so in under an hour.Concerns, wishes, etc:One thing I wish they would do is offer a speed control for the vibration. Although I personally do not like high vibration, as I get a bit nauseated from it, some people do. And, it's an all or nothing thing. Plug it in for vibration, or unplug it to stop. No on/off or high/medium/low (or dial for intensity).The stitching in a couple spots seem less than perfect. So, I am hoping the sttching holds for longer than it looks like it will.As for the sellers, they shipped immediately; seem to make themselves available if needed, but, not instant, so, if you do run into any issues, dont expect an answer the same day. Try going to youtube for a more instant answer. Fortunately, I did not need to make use of their support, and, as of the first few hours, I have not needed to contact anyone.Apparently the instructions were written in Chinese and translated with Google Translate (instead of the more natural DeepL) so, you get a few quirky and porrly written directions.Overall, I am extremely pleased with this transaction. (By the way, MOST transactions are good. It's just the few that do go sideways that worry me).Just a couple little issues that are minor concerns allow me to make this a highly recommended purchase. 93/100",

                "reviewText": "I got the red and black one for my office chair (computer work instead of gaming). It arrived on time via Prime (about 3 days). All the parts were included and it was packaged very well. I know my way around a toolbox and I found the assembly instructions to be very straight forward with good pictures. Tools were included as well as spare hardware. I recommend the following: Read through instructions before beginning assembly. It only takes a few minutes to read and as things come together it will all make more sense why the steps are in the order listed. Leave all hardware in packaging and open what you need when you need it. I used a pocket knife to open the cardboard back of each hardware part as needed. This kept the parts organized and easy to locate. Go step by step with the instructions. I had it assembled in about 30 minutes without rushing myself. The included vibratory back cushion was a nice little surprise too. I used a USB battery pack to power mine and attached it to the chair with a velcro strip I already had so I can move about freely. Plug in the USB when I want it and unplug it when I don't. Overall, quality is much higher than I expected. It feels solid and sturdy, and it is comfortable. It's an office chair and that's all I expect from it.",

                "reviewText": "I just bought the LEMBERI Gaming Chair with Footrest, and I have to say that I am very happy with it. As someone who is 6 feet tall and weighs about 340 pounds, it has been hard for me to find a comfortable and roomy game chair. But this chair was way better than I expected in every way.First and foremost, putting it together was a piece of cake. The steps were very easy to understand and follow. The layout of the parts was well-thought-out, so the whole process went smoothly. Even though I'm not very good at putting together furniture, it was easy for me to do. The LEMBERI team deserves praise for making it easier to set up.Now, let's talk about ease of living. This chair has changed the way I play games. It's great for tall people like me because it has a lot of room. I no longer feel tight or trapped when I work or play games. The seat's width is more than enough, and it fits my bigger body without making me feel uncomfortable.When we're talking about ease, the armrests at first made me hesitant. I thought they might limit how wide the seat could be, but boy, was I wrong! The armrests are very well-padded and can be moved, so I can find the right spot for my arms to rest while keeping the chair's open feel. They have become an important part of my gaming times, giving me the support and comfort I need.This chair is not only very comfy, but it is also very well made. The materials used feel strong and long-lasting, so I know it will work even if I use it a lot. The added footrest is a great feature that gives me extra support and lets me relax during long game sessions.In conclusion, the LEMBERI Gaming Chair with Footrest is a great choice for gamers like me who are bigger and weigh more. The instructions were clear and the parts were laid out in a way that made it easy to put together. The chair was bigger and more comfortable than I expected, and the arms made the whole experience even better. I would highly suggest this chair to anyone looking for a sturdy, comfortable, and stylish gaming chair. It has completely changed the way I play games, making them much more fun and engaging.",

Assembly is super easy. I think they took about 5-10 minutes each to put together. They also work great for the poker table!",
