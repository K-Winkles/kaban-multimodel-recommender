This is a very sturdy stand, has some weight to it. Like the holes in the base of the legs if you wanted to add stakes to secure it to the ground. I was able to assemble this myself in about 25 minutes. Instructions are a bit rough but just looking at the picture and the parts gave me some direction. When a swing was attached, there was no sense or feeling like it was going to tip. I would recommend this and I'm glad I choose wisely.",

                "reviewText": "The only thing that I did not like was the flimsy washers that came with the thing..Everything else is good. It is easy to assemble. There is not any kind of adjustment and it does not swivel.You may or may not need extra spring/carabiner and it does depend on the length of the chair you have. Keep in mind that the fabric of the chair will eventually stretch with use and you butt may become too close to the bottom connection (you don't want to hit that). For my chair, an extra knot at the top hanging rope solved the problem (at least for now).The longer section of the base is forward and please, no swinging on this thing -this warning is on the instructions too ;-)",
