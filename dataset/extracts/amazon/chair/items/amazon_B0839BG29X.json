                "reviewText": "My husband is an over the road transport truck driver. I\u2019ve done on a couple trips with him, both local and out of state, and my God! The jolts and up and down movement of an 18 wheeler should be considered cruel and unusual punishment! My back was shot the very first time and I got motion sickness as well.My husband has been doing this job for 8 years and it\u2019s no wonder his back hurts so much.He\u2019s very fit, 6\u20192 and 165lbs. Works out and we have a custom made bed that we for specifically for back pain.But almost daily he complains about how much his back hurts.We got this lumbar support back cushion and he just raves about it. He says it helps keep his back aligned in the drivers seat and provides enough cushion for the shocks his spine gets from the jolting of the truck. You can feel every single turn and bump on the road in an 18 wheeler, so this helped him so much!In fact the first week of use, he didn\u2019t ask me to manage his back not once!Plus he\u2019s able to sleep longer without waking up from being in pain. He\u2019s young, 34yo, so preserving his spine during this type of work is for sure a win for him!The price is great considering how helpful it is. I\u2019d gladly pay more if it\u2019s helping him with the comfort of his job.",

As a 5'6\" female the length and depth of this pillow aligns well with my frame (i.e., smaller and more compact than others tried) and provides the required support. well worth the investment and great quality of materials used.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m big on writing reviews because before I buy anything on here I scour reviews for what feels like forever! So, here\u2019s an honest review:It\u2019s a comfortable, squishy, foam-like pillow for back support IF you can find the right spot and get it to actually stay there.I have had so much trouble getting the pillow to stay put and I feel like every single day I have to readjust it to a point where it actually feels comfortable.That being said- I do work in a doctors office so I get up from my chair about (what feels like) 50 times an hour so it could also just be user error where it\u2019s not meant to be moved around that much.Our office chairs also have a slightly different design than most so that could also contribute to my problem.I\u2019ve also noticed that this back support juts out a lot so I\u2019m left sitting on what feels like the edge of my seat. Again, could just be my office chair. I wouldn\u2019t know how much it juts out on any other chair.PROS:- Soft- Comfortable- 2 straps to adjust tightness to chair- Size covers my entire backCONS:- Trouble keeping it in one spot\u2026 constantly having to readjust it- A bit bulky- Straps seem to loosen on their ownTLDR; Comfortable, good support\u2026 Make sure to attach snugly to chair and you should be fine.",

The cover of the lumbar support pillow is easy to maintain, breathable material in the middle section covering large part of the back area; and the side of the lumbar pillow is using velvet which looks elegant.
