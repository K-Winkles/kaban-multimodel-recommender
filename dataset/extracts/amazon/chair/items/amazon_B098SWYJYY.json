It's like a cozy cloud for your behind, making those extended hours of play feel like a breeze. What really caught my attention is the fabric on the back \u2013 it's not just comfy, but also surprisingly stable. Unlike those solid surfaces that can make you feel like you're sticking to the chair, this fabric lets you breathe, and I'm all for that. And let's not forget about the build quality \u2013 top-notch. You can tell this chair was crafted with care. It's sturdy and reliable, which is just what you need when you're in the heat of battle. Plus, the amazing price for this level of build quality is the cherry on top.And the convenience factor? It's a breeze to put together. The assembly process is so straightforward, they practically laid out the whole thing like a map. Sections are clearly marked, and it's a smooth experience from start to finish. So, not only do you get a chair that pampers you during gaming marathons, but you also get one that doesn't make you sweat during setup. All in all, if you're looking for a chair that treats your body right during gaming marathons, you appreciate a thoughtful design, and you value ease of assembly, this one's definitely worth a serious look.",

                "reviewText": "Day 1 (July 2022) - First impression is for the value it's really not a bad chair. The seat is a bit hard, but for the price it's not terrible. Quality-wise it feels good. Definitely cheap plastic but again, for the price what do you expect? I'm 5'4 and cannot touch the ground when it's at it's highest. The back of the seat is great, very supportive for what it is, follows the curvature of your back well and even makes contact if you like to lean. Casters aren't terrible, actually pretty nice and roll pretty fluidly on my tile. At a glance, this does not look like some generic cheap chair as well. It rocks a little which is nice as well. Tilting isn't too bad and has a decent range if you need it. Overall, day 1/first use I really am surprised with it. Definitely worth the money, which I paid around $60 at the time.",

                "reviewText": "Ordered this chair as a replacement to one for home office. When received an arm rest was broken. I contacted customer support on a Saturday evening and Sunday they replied back apologizing and asking if I could include a picture of the default. Once supplied they responded back within minutes and said they would be gathering the required parts with new hardware and shipping it out. As soon as they shipped, they supplied the tracking info and I had the parts in 3 days. Replace the broken part and the chair works and operates perfect. The customer service they have is above and beyond. Any issue I would recommend contacting them as they will work to resolve the issue.The only reason 4 star on the overall is the chair is a little narrower than what is listed. For extended use in the chair may deem to be tight on the hips for a 6 ft + person. Otherwise it is very comfy and cushiony chair for the value.",

                "reviewText": "When COVID broke I ended up purchasing a gaming chair that was absolutely horrible. It was flat, super uncomfortable, heavy, the arm rests were loose and the chair made constant creaking sounds that were so loud that I had to mute my mic during meetings. I finally had enough and set out looking for something more mature, better made, but not too expensive. This NEO Chair came up in my initial search, and I really like the modern look, and it has lots of positive feedback, but for $60 I assumed it was probably another junk chair. More searching showed chairs that looked identical with the same features, but for more money, so I decided I\u2019d take the chance on the NEO chair, and I\u2019m SO glad I did! This chair is AWESOME! It arrived in perfect shape. I was surprised at the small amount of screws that were needed for assembly, which means there\u2019s less moving parts that can loosen over time. It literally took me 6 minutes to assemble the chair, and I agree with others that the directions could be better to show the orientation for the arm rests. When I sat in it for the first time I was amazed. The chair is super comfortable, and fits my medium build just perfectly. The padding of the chair is great. Not too soft, not too hard. The seat bottom has a small well/depression close to the seat back, which anchors me in the chair as if it was built for me. I noticed the bracket to mount the seat has slots for the bolts, so you can position the seat bottom forward or backwards slightly to accommodate the length of your thighs. While it\u2019s only about 1/2\u201d worth of adjustment, it\u2019s nice to have a little adjustability. The casters glide smoothly, and the chair swivels effortlessly. I was concerned that the immovable lumbar support wouldn\u2019t match my physique, but the mesh back is super comfortable and the lower back support is right where it needs to be. The mesh back also keeps my back from sweating, and since I\u2019m in the seat for 8 hours a day, this is a great feature. As others have noted, the arm rests are too low to rest my elbows on when typing, but that\u2019s a sniggle I can live with considering how much this chair does right, along with the price point. I\u2019ve only had the chair for a week now, so the longevity/ quality of the chair is yet to be determined, with my main concern being if the padding in the chair will not lose it\u2019s cushioning over time, and that the mesh seat back wont stretch over time and lose it\u2019s elasticity. For now, I couldn\u2019t be happier with this chair!",
