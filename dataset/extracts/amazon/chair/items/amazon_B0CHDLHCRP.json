I have purchased great cushions to sit on, neck support when I slept, & tried several back pillows that didn't work. This item is perfect for me. It supports, so comfortable, & is not hot!!! During the day I use it upright in the chair. When I slept I turn it sideways in the chair with my neck cushion. When I lay down I fold it up for support under my legs.

Every part of my shoulder blades and back are now supported as I sit in my round chair at night. It has made a big difference in my pain level. Thank you!!",

The panels are convenient for adding more support/height. Hopefully the filler will hold up in the long run. Purchased several for family members, mom: lumbar, sons: backs, daughter: comfort. While packaging sleeve is nice, seems reusable, since it was nearly impossible to pull item out, it will take Superman-strength to put it back in. Seems to be durable for most individuals/\"average\"-size...I am 5'2\"/130lbs (average-size?). Hope this helps...will see if I can add to review after a while, esp if any drastic changes. :)",

                "reviewText": "Ok let's get one POSSIBLE, and slight negative out of the way: IF you may have an extra high-back chair, you may conclude that this back cushion isn't long enough...?? In my view; it \"is\" long enough, for me, because even though I do, in fact, have a high-back chair (i.e. a \"big and tall\" model chair), this back cushion does in fact cover the entire back...from top to bottom, BUT it doesn't loop over the top of the chair, like it is shown in some pictures of it, looping/hanging over a chair. What's the big deal? Well; if it can loop over the top/back of a chair, it can be weighted/situated perfectly, so as not to require any periodic adjusting or moving around or whatever.... But that's not a big deal, to me, because each time I sit down, I very simply take a few seconds, to maneuver it to right where I want it, and it remains there, for as long as I'm seated... So; is that a big deal, or a deal-breaker?? Not at all. The only thing that that means is that the thing is \"less than perfect\". Bottom line for ME is: I LOVE THIS THING!!!",

It can get decently warm after a few minutes of use. But not too bad.2. I feel like that mid-back area needs a bit more support. But I've managed to solve that by putting a very small pillow between the chair and the GIVANLEE pillow.",
