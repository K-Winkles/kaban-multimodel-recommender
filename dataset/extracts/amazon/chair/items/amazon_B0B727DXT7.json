The wheels have gotten a bit squeaky and the cushioning has pretty much worn down, but for the price it is well worth it. It also looks nice, and is spacious. It fits perfectly under my desk- no annoying arm rests in the way. It doesn't adjust as high as I need it to, but it is standard size and it works. Very easy to assemble, easy to clean with a wet rag (you just can't scrub the material very hard, it will ruin it). The color has not faded. I'd say it's holding up very well.",
