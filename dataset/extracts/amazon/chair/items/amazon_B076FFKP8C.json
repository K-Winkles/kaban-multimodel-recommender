                "reviewText": "First off, the package was delayed. However, I digress. When the package arrived, I was super excited to build it. I love building my furniture. I never had issues building things on my own. This product was the worst chair that I've ever seen.1 - The metal pieces were all rusted where the holes were and the ends of the metal pieces.2 - the manual/instructions were garbage. I literally sat in my living room, trying to understand this manual. It was like I was playing telestrations with this manual.3 - The pieces don't align. I've tried multiple ways in case I misinterpreted the manual. I even took their advice not to tighten the bolts until the final steps. The backrest didn't even fit. The chair legs were not flushed on the floor when they did fit. One leg would always be lifted (not touching the floor). The seat took some pressure to snap on. The screw meant to nail the backrest to the chair didn't fit. I could only screw 1/3of it into the chair hole. Then, it's bent in such a weird way that it was uncomfortable to sit in.4 - This product was $40+ after tax.Don't fall for this trap. I wish I could give it -5 stars.",

And while the product was picked up the next day, after I reported my return, I'm still waiting on my refund and it's been a week. It's extremely disappointing to have to go through the process yet again. it seemed like the perfect chair for the desk I bought with it initially, but I guess I was mistaken.",
