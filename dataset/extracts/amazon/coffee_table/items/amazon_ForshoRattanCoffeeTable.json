After I complained about the restocking fee that they charged me, their customer support reached me and refunded the restocking fee that they previously charged. So it's so nice and supportive. About this product, I think you get what you pay. So if you looking to have some modern look furniture maybe for your office this is a good option. But for my living room, I looking for something more sturdy and high quality based on the wood and structure. Also, it was too small for my space so consider the length of it (41 inches).",
