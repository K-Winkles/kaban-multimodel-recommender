The table top comes in 4 pieces (quarters) and the pattern/grain of the 4 pieces don\u2019t even line up to look like they go there. They also have small gaps in between all the pieces so it looks cheap and is very obvious it\u2019s not one piece. Sturdiness isn\u2019t great either.",

It's way to small to be a coffee table but slightly too big and awkward to be an end table. I can see it being a toddler table for arts and crafts or something but nothing else. It's in like 10 pieces when it arrives and the wood grain doesn't match at all. The table top is in 4 pieces when it arrives and no matter how I paired them up, it didn't match. Like really noticeable. I definitely don't recommend it for a coffee table.",

Because my sofa is huge, it looks pretty silly sitting in front of mine, and not sure why I didn't think of this before I got it. Otherwise, I really like it. It was super easy to assemble and the instructions were very thorough and easy to follow - making this actually enjoyable to put together. It didn't take long, and love how it looks in the end.",
