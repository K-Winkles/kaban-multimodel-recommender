The only problem is that the welds connecting the three legs to the table itself are very weak, and one of them broke. I wasn't in the room and they broke so I'm not sure if there was roughhousing that caused it but be aware. Fortunately, I know someone who is able to strengthen the welds for me to remove any future incidents.",

                "reviewText": "The woodgrain appearance turned out to be more like Walnut, rather than Oak. Just as I had hoped for. It's some kind of laminate, but has an authentic wood-like effect. It's a modest size that works well in our rather small mid century living room. Its easily assembled in less than 5 minutes with six screws provided. I would caution against over tightening though. You could knock it over if you tried, but in normal use it's quite sturdy. So, again, it's a little more on the brown side, color wise. if that is important to you. It's a super value for the price.",
