The small table is no problem however the bigger table, I found that I had the same problem. The instructions are not very good. There are multiple holes in the top and bottom ring. The key is to use the table top to align which holes it uses. The top has inserts for the screws, so it can only use those holes. I then use the other holes to screw in the the bars and they all line up with the top and bottom ring.The tables are nice and very reasonably priced.",
