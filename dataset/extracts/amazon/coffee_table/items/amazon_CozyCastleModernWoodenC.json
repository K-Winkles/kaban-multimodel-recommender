                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Great table, but my shipment had defects; seller addressed them.",
                "reviewText": "There was a very similar, nearly identical table on Wayfair, but it was $125.99, so I went for this one, which was $89.99 at the time of this review. I love the minimalist and modern look of the table. Another plus is that the drawer can be opened from either side, and can also be placed in either compartment.The reason I want to give this particular product 3 stars is because it had several defects upon delivery. One of the wooden pegs was decayed and missing a chunk. One of the two big panels had scratches on the side (and they would be visible after assembly). The other panel had some warping/bubbling on one of the edges as well, and it sort of looked like water damage. Lastly, one of the holes in the panel was missing a rubber ring that had to be in there in order for the pegs to fit in snugly. We ended up assembling the table without that third peg, and it seems fine, though it makes me nervous that essentially 33% of the reinforcement is missing. Lastly, the product had clearly been used previously, as there were streaks and weird marks on the panel that I think was used as the table top.Upon bringing these issues to the attention of the seller and asking for a partial or full refund, they offered me 20%, which I thought was low\u2014I paid for a new table, but I got a clearly used one with several defects. They then offered 50% and I accepted. I appreciate their customer service and attentiveness, and it\u2019s the key reason I\u2019m not giving them a 2 or 3 star rating.Originally, I purchased it on June 29 and received it on July 1, despite the original delivery estimate saying July 2-8. It always took less than 24 hours to hear back from the seller as well, and they addressed all my concerns well, so I\u2019m bumping it up to 4.",
