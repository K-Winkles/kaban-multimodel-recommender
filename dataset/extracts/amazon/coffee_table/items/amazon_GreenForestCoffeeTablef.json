Extremely sturdy, does not feel cheap, LOVE the rounded (as opposed to sharp) corners, easy to move around (I put felt at bottom of legs), beautiful wood grain pattern (I bought gray wash color), very spacious middle section in which I could easily fit my very large baskets for storage. Love this table and manufacturer did a great job! My only advice when putting it together is DO NOT TIGHTEN ANY SCREWS until ALL parts including two wooden pieces are in place and DON'T OVERTIGHTEN as the metal bends easily. Super happy with this purchase and highly recommend!",
