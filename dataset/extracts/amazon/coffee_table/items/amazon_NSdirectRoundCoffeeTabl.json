                "reviewText": "I've been looking for a nice and affordable coffee table for my small living room and found this for nearly half the price of similar tables I saw over at Wayfair or Overstock. (I purchased it for $135 but it looks like the price has risen a bit--still totally worth it!)The table arrived quickly and everything was intact. There were no scuffs or damage to the table top like some of the other reviews stated. And although it's not made of solid wood, it's still quite sturdy.I assembled it alone and it took me about 40 minutes---but I was also watching a movie during the same time so that added to the overall time. The assembly was fairly easy but I would recommend having a 2nd pair of hands when attaching the base level. This would make aligning things easier when screwing in the legs to the base.All in all it's a really nice looking piece and looks much more expensive than what I paid for.",
