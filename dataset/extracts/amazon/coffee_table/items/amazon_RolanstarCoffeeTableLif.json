I\u2019m so glad I did bc it fits perfectly in my tiny living room, it\u2019s a great size, it was actually pretty easy to build (I\u2019m petite 26 year old woman who was able to build it all by myself and it includes the one tool you need which is a screwdriver so that was pretty convenient and I had no trouble) and it\u2019s actually pretty darn good quality for Amazon furniture. Some of the stuff can be iffy on here and you kinda just get what you\u2019re paying for so it\u2019s easy to get cheap items for cheap quality, but this one looks really nice and the wood pierces are pretty darn hefty.All in all, worth the purchase. I\u2019m very satisfied and now I have some place to eat in my tiny home that is too small for a kitchen table.",

I love the look and size and all the storage, the only thing I don't love is how wobbly the top feels when moving up and down. You have to use two hands to keep it level as you lift or it won't want to go or get a little stuck. Nothing product breaking, but if that was smoother and sturdier this would be a 5 star product for me. That being said the price was very reasonable too so I'll deal with it, though I'd be wary of kids wanting to play with it.",

I didn\u2019t know what to expect but I\u2019m pleasantly surprised by the quality and the accuracy from the pictures in the description. It fairly easy to put together, took about two hours for one person. All of the pre drilled holes lined up and were level. The color of the wood is exactly as shown. My one complaint is one of our side panels came cracked, but we were able to make it work without compromising the structural integrity of the coffee table. The hinging top works as described. Definitely not the most sturdy, you need to be gentle with it but all together it\u2019s a good piece for the price.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this coffee table for the storage + lift top. It\u2019s a great color! I was worried about the sturdiness of the lift top when assembling, but as long as you lift with both hands, the table is PERFECT - it\u2019s only a little wobbly on the lift/descent because of the hinge. Once it\u2019s fully lifted or lowered, it\u2019s 100% sturdy and I feel confident about working and eating at the table. Assembly wasn\u2019t too bad - had the help of my boyfriend (who refused to use the wood glue on his pieces \ud83d\ude44). I feel like the screws, pegs, glue, hinge, drawers, and most of the wood is very high quality! The flimsiest piece is the bottom of the drawers + bottom of the main compartment. Those are very thin and flimsy, which I suppose is how the cost was kept down. I wouldn\u2019t drop a hammer into the drawers, but if you\u2019re storing things like board games or even plates, you should be totally fine. There was no visible damage, scuffs, or marks on any of the pieces - and even if there were, the product comes with little stickers to cover up screws that you could totally use on marks! Overall, I\u2019d say this is a 10/10 product for your money! One of the best furniture pieces I\u2019ve gotten from Amazon.",

                "reviewText": "This is a good, more inexpensive option for a coffee table. It has great storage and different color options.It did take me about 3 hours in total to get it fully assembled. It was pretty straightforward, up until installing the lift top. It took me a good 45 mins to figure out how to get it installed correctly, which could be my own fault, but I think the manual could have been a but clearer, especially for someone who has never built a lift top table.At 1st, I thought there was an issue with my hinges. I couldn't get the top to sit flush with the rest of the table, so I took the whole thing off 3 times to figure it out. I read through reviews that also had issues with the hinges, so I figured maybe I just got sent hydrologic ones instead of spring loaded. I figured I'd try attaching the hinges to the inside of the table 1st and then try attaching the top, and this is when I found out that I was putting the top on backwards which was causing it not to sit flush.I'm not sure if this is the same issue other reviewers are having with their tops not sitting flush, but I docked a star just because I think the manual could have shown not to flip the top around.Other then the long assembly time, everything else is perfect.",

                "reviewText": "This table is fantastic - beautiful, sturdy, and the perfect height for dining by the TV. The product came 3 days early. As others have said in reviews, it is easier to attach the hydraulic arms to the table & then add the table top, rather than putting the arms on the top and attaching it after (like the instructions say). Quite heavy, package was 51lbs. As a smaller person, it was definitely a 2 person job. Took me & one other person roughly 1h 45mins to finish the build.Pros: perfect height, beautiful colour, lots of storage space. Relatively easy instructions. Lots of spare bits in case anything gets lost. Comes with rubbery plastic bits to cover the table corners, in case you have little ones at home/want to avoid hurting yourself or others on the edges.Cons: I would have been unable to put it together myself (got help from a family member). The provided screwdriver stripped by the time we finished the build. Some of the inside edges for drawers were extremely sharp (family member was cut twice in our build process).Overall, super happy with the purchase :)",

                "reviewText": "The table is easy to assemble if you have a powered screwdriver. Each step is clearly shown in the booklet, it took me around 1.5 hrs to assemble. The quality is decent, and considering the price, it's definitely worth it. And it looks awesome! I love the details: a free screwdriver, corner protectors and spare parts. Overall a great experience. The only thing was the box was a hassle to open.. each side is heavily glued so literally had to tear the box open.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this for my main living room. I have an older, small, \"cottage\" type house and I wanted something that would provide extra storage and not look too bulky like my current coffee table. Overall I am really impressed with this unit. From the colour to how it functions in my space. I bought the smaller model and yet it still has alot of usable storage and I love how the table top raises so I can use it as a workplace as well. It is well worth the price I paid. There were ALOT of pieces for this unit! It took me quite a bit of time to put together as one person. If two people were doing it, it might go better. You will definitely need a second person to help with attaching the table top to the unit - I had to go and borrow a neighbor - its heavy and awkward to attach. But everything came labelled and the directions were easy to follow. It also includes a pkg of spare parts just in case.",
