My daughter uses the baby one for her tablet and it keeps her from looking down and straining her neck. The fold out table is perfect for a 4 person card game and you could easily double up and make it up to 8 people! Then it easily folds up and you can\u2019t even tell. There\u2019s also an inside shelf for electronics or movies and two sliding barn doors that cover two more shelving systems on each side. It was easy to assemble other than figuring out our left and right sides when installing the smaller tables opposite from each other, make sure to read the directions! And you can\u2019t beat the price!!",

                "reviewText": "We put this table in our playroom in front of our U-shaped sectional. Worked out great. Just a heads up before you purchase:1. Unit is not as \"GREY\" as it appears in the listing pics. Definitely has more brownish tones mixed in. Wished it was more grey like the pics. (Minus 1 star)2. There is a thin panel that slides inside a channel. The two side assemblies also have the channel to trap it place once its all screwed together. The problem is that the factory routered channel was gone over a 2nd time (about 3/4\" to each end of the channel was added), because the channel wasn't long enough for the panel board to fit into it. One of the side assemblies had been fixed, but the other side had not. So you can extend the channel with about a 3/16\" rabbit bit on a router, or notch out the corners of the panel board, which is what I did. (Minus a 2nd star)3. I'm very handy and have lots of tools. But it still took me 3+ hours to assemble.4. Do not let kids play with this! Don't get me wrong, it's very sturdy - IF - yes, IF you follow the directions on how to use the pop-up sections of the table. If you forget to raise the small platform up, before unfolding the 2nd half of the table top, the hinges will get ripped off. So pay attention and handle with care.5. The packaging was great \ud83d\udc4d6. The finish of the table seems to be pretty resilient, so should last a long time.So if you're OK with #s 1-4, buy one and you won't regret it! Nice table overall \ud83d\udc4c",

Very well made and easy to put together. I did not purchase it on here because I wanted a place that I could return it easily since it would be very heavy to return so I got it at Walmart but it is cheaper on here so if I knew it was a perfect color I would have ordered it from this seller.",
