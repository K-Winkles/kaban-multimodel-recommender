                "reviewText": "Purchased 3 of these in May 2022 for part of an updating project for a vacation rental house in Panama City Beach FL. They were easy to assemble especially after the first one was done and assembling the remaining 2 was a breeze! Furniture takes a real beating especially from children in a vacation rental and has to be replaced more often than in a personal home. The low price of these coffee tables made them very attractive. It has been 1.5 years now since they were installed and there is absolutely no wear and tear showing on any of them. There are no ring marks on the tops from guests placing cold drinks that sweat that typically will damage tops of more expensive wood end tables. We also purchased matching coffee tables with the same experience.",
