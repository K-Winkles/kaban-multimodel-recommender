Hubby thought it was an end table instead of a coffee table. I wanted something small since this is for our office space just to put a remote or a drink on occassionally. I wouldn't but this for my home living room though bc of the size. Definitely get a bigger one if you need it for that otherwise if your space is tight this would work nicely.",
