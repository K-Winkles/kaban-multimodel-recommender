The table is attractive and serves its purpose.Cons: The screwdriver is \"short\" and can be difficult to use when attaching multiple screws. The bottom panels did not come with pre-drilled holes to secure the metal brackets. That was difficult if you didn't have a drill. Pre-drilled holes would have been appreciated.The two top panels on the table don't seem to flush. When assembled, one panel was about a 1/4 inch off from the other panel. I'm still trying to figure out why. The bottom panels are fine.The company apologized for the problem and offered a small refund. Great company to work with and very responsive to my emails.",

In the right light you can see a hint of grey in it. The sides are not white. It also has a hint of grey. ( lighting is key). It looks great either way. Wasn\u2019t damaged in any way. Is sturdy. Quality is fine. For the price it is excellent. Mine is in a room that doesn\u2019t get used and that is the reason I didn\u2019t spend a fortune.

                "reviewText": "Der Tisch sieht wirklich 100%-ig so aus wie auf dem Bild. Die Anleitung war wirklich einfach und unkompliziert. Alle L\u00f6cher waren vorgebohrt und alles hat ohne gro\u00dfen Kraftaufwand zusammen gepasst. Der Tisch ist optisch wirklich sch\u00f6n und wirkt auf mich hochwertig. Steht stabil und da wackelt wirklich gar nichts.Einzig eventuell die geteilte Tischplatte k\u00f6nnte ein Manko sein, weil sich in dieser Ritze gern Dreck ansammelt. Aber im Gro\u00dfen und Ganzen bin ich sehr zufrieden und w\u00fcrde den Tisch auch ein 2. Mal kaufen.",
