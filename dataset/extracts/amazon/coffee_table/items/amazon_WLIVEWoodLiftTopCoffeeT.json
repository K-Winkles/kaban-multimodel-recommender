After installing hinges wrong and re-doing it, it finally came together and looks great. Only downsides: can\u2019t open/close hinged part with one hand, and it\u2019s not super smooth, but it does seem sturdy. And, I worry the finish will get damaged from liquids or scratched when using for drinks/food plates on it (are we only peeps that eat dinner always in front of tv sitting on sofa??) so I went to hardware store to see if I could get glass cut to put on top, and was quoted $150!! Not gonna spend twice the cost of table to protect the top, so we will see how long this lasts and how it wears.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a coffee table and I saw this one and read the reviews so I went for it. Overall, it's a nice piece. The finish seems a little fragile so use coasters and don't put anything with rough edges on it. If a big dog jumps up on this, it's all over. The pull-up table is okay but a touch wobbly. I really don't use that part of it but I do enjoy the storage. My only issue is that it's rather small once you get it set up. I'd love the table more if it was twice as long. Also, they should really pre-assemble this and just ship it so you screw the legs on it (I got a file cabinet like that so I know they can do it). Anyway, I really can't complain for the price. I gave it a lot of stars because I needed one and this works. Also, it showed up on my doorstep so I didn't have to go to the store, deal with salespeople, wait a month, schedule the delivery. It just showed up with Prime. I'd recommend and I'd get this again for another room. I hope this helps you make an informed decision.",

Came with extra pieces of hardware just in case. Is pretty. Hydraulics are plenty stiff but move easily. I put it together by myself. It took me 2+ hours but everything worked well. Comes with all necessary tools but if you have your own screw drivers and socket wrench set, that worked better. Nice storage. Legs are plastic. I will replace with wood and a bit liner (taller) if possible. Nice storage. Well worth the sale price.",

We frequently eat dinner at the coffee table and watch tv, and this is perfect for that. The assembly was kind of time consuming, but very straightforward. My one issue with this is the overall height. It sits very low in general. For some that may be great, for others maybe not. It is nice to kick your feet up on and feels very sturdy. The space inside holds way more than you think, we have ours filled with board games and other things. Watch out for the sharp corners with pets or little ones!",

It shows using a drill in the video but I would just use a screw driver as the wood is very thin and could crack really easily.",

But for a future buyer:I had a hard time getting some of the screws to go in all the way, so I had to use an electric drill. The instructions were easy to follow otherwise.Keep in mind it is a coffee table so even though it lifts up it is still quite short. if you have a low couch then it\u2019ll be perfect but my couch is higher up. It doesn\u2019t really affect me much but just a heads up!Those are the only negatives, its easy to install if you can follow instructions. Its color is nearly identical to the one in the photo, its sturdy (I stood on it to hang up Christmas lights the other day), overall worth the money",
