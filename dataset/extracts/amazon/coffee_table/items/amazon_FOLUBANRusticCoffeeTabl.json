                "reviewText": "It was delivered sooner than expected, in perfect condition, both a pleasant surprise! I unpackaged then had it assembled in 5 minutes. Super Easy! Another nice surprise was to find the sellers personal email embedded in the instructions! All tools were included and instructions were clearly written! really I had the whole thing done in 5 minutes, literally just a set of screws to hold the legs onto the top. Became a little Dusty so I wiped it down with the dampened paper towel before beginning to assemble. It is definitely a rustic finish which surprised me a bit. I didn't realize I was hoping for something more smooth but will likely order a tempered glass top from the local glass shop or put a coat or 2 of polyruethane to protect the finish from spills. I love it! It's the perfect large but not overwhelming size - exactly what I needed in front of my couch. It's 2 inches shorter than my couch. Has very clean lines which makes me want to leave it cleaned off off- and less clutter is good! that's a good thing. Sometimes I just want to get off the couch and sit on the floor and use it kind of like a little desk while you're watching TV, go through some mail, things like that. I'm glad I didn't get a table with a second lower bottom shelf. Also I hope kids visit, sit on the rug, play games or work on projects- it's a great place for \"little\" ones to congregate while adults remain closeby. Love the color, it's sturdy, Never wobbles, with squared but not super sharp edges. Has a modern minimalist look. Color is true. I could have purchased something a little more formal or for storage butI am trying to minimize stuff owned This is perfect for now. Its lightweight but the legs secure it firmly in placed. I definitely see my college age kids wanting it someday and I am sure it will last a long time ( not press board). Crafted well and if you looking for a rustic, basic, budget friendly, sturdy, and minimalist coffee table with high potential for multifunctionality, you too will be happy with this. I really like it because it's super simple yet sturdy. Height is absolutely perfect I can extend my legs and rest my heels if I want to. But don't let anybody know my feet are on the table under that blanket! I know it will have a brightened look In Summer with a vase of yellow and white flowers! I'm happy!",
