About 100 screws you have to put in, hence the blisters. Almost returned it and gave up but after 5 long hours and the fact my mom didn't raise a quitter, I managed to half-way put it together to where it's functioning. The slides for the drawers have me baffled still..managed to get the drawers in with only one slide on each drawer and it works but it's not right. I do not recommend this table.
