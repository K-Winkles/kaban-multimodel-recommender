The pictures on the side that make it look like an X doesn't show it will not set evenly on the floor as the bottom of the Xs are not flat. The second shelf I tried to show in the picture looks like an amateur or someone whom has never used a saw as it was completely crooked throwing the table off balance and lastly I was not expecting it to be child height it's so close to the floor it's pointless. I attached pictures so others could be warned the saying \"you get what you pay for \" definitely stands true on this coffee table. If you're a college student just trying to make do or maybe your 1st apartment and you are trying to make do then sure otherwise please spend a lil more and get something that actually looks like an adult might own/purchase. Picked it up today to vacuum and the entire top piece fell apart in my hands. Unfortunately I have already thrown away the box or I would return it but I can't stand clutter and immediately tossed the box once I took it out and made sure all pieces were included.",

I am still not entirely sure if this is my issue or the table\u2019s issue. I took it apart twice and started over, looking very carefully at the not so helpful, instructional diagrams. I ended up giving up. It is put together, it seems sturdy enough, but I feel like it should not have taken me two hours to do. On the plus side, it is exactly as pictured, and, like I said, it seems sturdy enough for having two leftover screws. It will suit my needs. And for the price, I\u2019m happy enough.
