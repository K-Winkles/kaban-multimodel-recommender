If you take your time building it, the desk is actually very sturdy. I followed the guide, and the desk came out great, no wobbles. Box is heavy so you might need help with the glass.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great, sleek-looking small desk for a computer, easy to put together and sturdy. It was well-packed for shipping. I ordered two within 2 weeks of each other and both arrived in perfect condition. Note that if you have an optical mouse, it won't work well on the glass surface without a mouse pad or a vinyl sheet to serve as a flat mouse pad, but I've found putting a wireless mouse on the white shelf underneath works well.The glass is very heavy and sturdy and the bamboo legs look great. I use one desk in my office for my large monitor/keyboard/mouse and a pencil tray underneath. My laptop and dock live on another shelf as it was too crowded to put them all together on this desk. If you need a lot of writing space in addition to a monitor/keyboard, this is not the desk for you. I can fit a small notebook (A5 size, open) next to the keyboard but that's all. I can't also have reference papers, books, etc. on this desk but I have a separate work table if I need to spread out more.The second one I purchased lives in our playroom where we have an older All-In-One PC on it, with a wireless keyboard and wireless mouse. It's actually perfect height and size for kids, with a simple IKEA stool as the seat. Assembly takes about 20 minutes, and is easier with two people, though possible for one person to do it. The outer box looked pretty beat up, but the components inside were in pristine condition.",

                "reviewText": "I had this desk since 2018; about 4 years+. My fiance and I bought 2 of these desks for our gaming set up. We also bought a bamboo riser for our screen to maximize desk surface. Although I game, which means I need a large surface for my keyboard and mouse, because of the glass see through, I am able to put my keyboard underneath and have the entire desk for my journaling and crafty stuff. This is the feature I like the most about this desk. It gives me more room to do everything without having to put my keyboard, mouse pad and mouse away when I do other stuff that needs a large surface of my desk. Meanwhile, my fiance is the opposite. He likes to stuff random junk under his desk and just lift his large mouse pad to \"find\" what he needs. The down side of this desk is that it does wobble. It doesn't feel secure enough to put our PC on the table; but not like we want to anyway because we like having as much room on the desk as possible. So over the 4 years, there is very minimum and unnoticeable scratches on the glass even though we had broken it down before because we had to move to a different house. The desk is very easy to assemble and resemble, just make sure to keep all parts. We did lose 1 screw in the back bar, but it still holds very well. As much as I want to get a standing desk when we build a gaming room, we decide to just keep these desks or repurchase in the future because of how simplistic and beautiful it looks. I just hope overtime, they will improve the wobbling legs. Basically if we nudge it, the whole desk does wobble. But it is very solid and have not broken down or cause us any problem at all. All in all, I strongly recommend this desk for whoever reading this. :)",
