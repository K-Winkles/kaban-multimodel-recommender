I have children who are tough on things & these are not real wood, so I anticipate having to replace them in a couple of years again. All in all though, for the money, they are really cute & putting them together was pretty simple. I love the look of them!",

When lifting the top piece off we discover the second piece was not only split but had a 4\" piece broken off . I contacted amazon and they said we would have to ship it back for a replacement or refund???? Take it apart? No way so my handy husband figured out how to fix the back piece and since it goes towards the wall it won't show. other than that great quality for the price,",
