I appreciate it.",

It was a piece of cake to assemble.However, there are a handful of imperfections on it. The black paint has flaked off in one small spot and there are one or two places where the particle board is a little smashed in. You have to be up very close to see the defects. I figure my kids will be hard on it anyways. It is a decent looking table.",
