The box includes instructions and all of the tools needed to put the tables together. I was able to put them together within and hour and half, it was a cool project to do. The tables fit right in with the gray and white marble table in the room and other decor. Lightweight and sturdy, the base was flat, not uneven, so there wasn't any wobblieness. They only critique I would have is the yellowish gold base, could be elevated more with a better quality color and paint. while the paint didn't chip, the color a weird tan yellow gold, like a pukey gold should be changed and elevated. Even silver or an irridescent pearl/gray would be better.",

I did it myself but an extra pair of hands holing the bars while putting the screws in would have been helpful. It came with a very odd amount of extra parts but all the parts were there!

I\u2019m gonna spray paint it metallic gold for my preference. And, for the record, the description does say yellow but I obviously didn\u2019t see that until after I got them, scrunched up my face in disappointment then went back and read more carefully.The table tops are pretty but made from thick plastic. That makes these lightweight but also kinda cheap for the money. If I had seen these in person, I definitely wouldn\u2019t have bought them but it\u2019s not so bad that I\u2019m going to send them back. OK for my daughters bedroom but I would never put them in my living room if that\u2019s what you\u2019re considering.Assembly was easy but time consuming. The holes didn\u2019t want to line up easily, either, but I\u2019m no quitter and I made it happen.",
