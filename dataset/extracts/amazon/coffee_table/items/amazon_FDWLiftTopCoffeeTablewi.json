Well, when putting it together I noticed that one of the legs had a crack in it, but honestly not that big of deal to me. What really had me confused a bit were the amount of materials missing and certain parts that couldn't even go into places that it said it needed to go in. Turned into a 3 hour build when it really shouldn't have been that long. However, the finished product looks great in the living room, and the lifting top works very well. Good space to store miscellaneous items.",

Be careful putting on the legs especially because it is easy to break in the process. The top coming up and down is a bit flimsy, but for the price point I am not at all disappointed. Still very nice looking and convenient storage underneath. For small apartment living it is nice to have a pull up top because we do not have a kitchen table to eat. Multifunctional.",

I wouldn\u2019t know because I\u2019ve had it for 3 weeks now and still haven\u2019t been able to put it together because of missing parts. It started out it was missing 1 screw. Went to the hardware store and could not find one just right. Ok fine I\u2019ll make it work without it. I had read someone reenforced theirs with brackets so I was going to do the same. Then I realize that one of the boards is cut wrong. Email support. They have me send pictures. Pictures sent. They will send the right board. Get the box in. No board. Just a box full of hardware that I don\u2019t need. At least I\u2019ll have the one screw now (so I think, I didn\u2019t fit either). Emailed support again. Now I\u2019m still waiting for the board so I can put this table together. Shipping wasn\u2019t cheap on this item either. Which I understand. That\u2019s the whole reason I haven\u2019t sent the whole thing back.Update- after reaching out for tracking a week later on the second request they claimed they did not have the part that they told me they shipped. I could either completely take apart and send back for refund or get $20 refund. I ended up ripping the hardware that was made into it leaving a huge hole. Drilled a new hole where it should have been and got the table together and functional. I have a piece of duct tape over the hole on the leg but at least I have a coffee table now.",
