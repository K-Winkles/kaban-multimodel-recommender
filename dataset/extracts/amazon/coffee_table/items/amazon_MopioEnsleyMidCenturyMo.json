                "reviewText": "I always read the reviews before I purchase anything, but I rarely post one of my own. I really liked the way this coffee table looked and needed something like it to finish off my living room. Previous reviewers noted the unpacking takes time because of all the cardboard, styrofoam and paper, and they were right. What\u2019s important is there wasn\u2019t a scratch or damage to be found. Everything was in perfect condition. All components were clearly labeled and all smaller parts separated into their own smaller packets, but kept together in one larger one. The instructions are absolutely the most clear and complete that I\u2019ve ever come across- and I\u2019ve assembled countless things in the past. Not only that, each step has both a link and QR code to scan if you need help, plus available customer service if necessary. It is truly impressive. They tell you it will take you 2 people and 60 minutes. It took us longer, but we were very careful and watching football at the same time. Anyway, I suppose you could do it alone, but an extra set of hands definitely helped. We are very happy with the table. It\u2019s perfect for our room. I would definitely buy from this company again in the future. We highly recommend them.",

The sliding doors ARE on both sides (front and back) which is what I tried to figure out when buying it in case you are wondering that as well. The only slight issue was that there is one board that doesn\u2019t exactly line up with the top of the table making a very slight gap between the side and the top. It isn\u2019t super noticeable as you can\u2019t really see in picture (it\u2019s the slight gap on the side with the books) but is just one thing I\u2019d call out that to make it be perfect, it ideally would line up exactly. I\u2019d say it was worth the price and I love the way it looks! The sliding doors are nice and work well! I love the storage and hidden storage offered in this!",

Just like the TV stand, it\u2019s a great value and looks really nice.As per usual from Mopio, the packaging was fantastic. Protected, organized, and well thought out. My coffee table arrived without any damage whatsoever. I\u2019ve been on Amazon for about 10 years now, and they have some of the best packaging I\u2019ve seen.The build quality is what I expected after already getting the TV stand, for the price you can\u2019t beat the sturdiness and feel of this coffee table. All the pieces fit perfectly together, not sure what others are talking about. All in all, fantastic build quality that I expect will last me for years.Assembly is just okay, I\u2019ve assembled a lot of this type of furniture for myself and others. I recommend just getting the most open and clutter free space in your home to assemble this is. It\u2019s not hard, just a lot of pieces.Great stuff Mopio, will be ordering more from you guys soon.",

                "reviewText": "Ordered this one because the pictures looked understatedly elegant, and was not disappointed. The box is heavy, as all the pieces are pretty solid. Some reviews said the unpacking was messy\u2026it was mostly styrofoam pieces but not too bad. It was difficult to slide the large pieces out; you kind of have to tear open the box to do that more easily. I couldn\u2019t find the instructions \u2014 they were probably somewhere in the box, but not easily accessible even after I took out all pieces. However, you can find a pdf of the instructions on the Amazon page, which is what I used. Now I\u2019m not great at building furniture, but these use some specific written steps and that helped\u2014I never had any moments of confusion while building. You can build alone; though I\u2019m sure a second pair of hands would help. I\u2019m not handy and not strong and I was fine. Took me close to 2 hours with no breaks. As for tools, a screwdriver helped, and it comes with an Allen key. I saw some people used wood glue to hold the side pieces in; slamming them in and using the floor to press down did the job for me. The finished product looks great!",
