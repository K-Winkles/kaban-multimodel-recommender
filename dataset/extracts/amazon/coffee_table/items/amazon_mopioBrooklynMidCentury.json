It's just as pictured; a modern look that will fit with any design. I love the storage and lift top desk features. BUT, assembly is moderately difficult and time consuming. I did it by my myself but used a drill carefully though instructions say not to. The legs were almost impossible to install because the screws would not go in all the way, even with a drill. I finally put wax on the screws, and that helped.It is heavy wood. And end result is beautiful. All the hard work was worth it!",

                "reviewText": "First, I want to begin by saying I absolutely love the aesthetic of this piece and it seems very sturdy. The lift top functions well, it does take some effort to get it up though. I love having the additional storage for controllers and such. My main gripe with this coffee table and the reason for a 4 star rating is the building process. It took two of us three hours to get this thing together, we went based off of the written directions. When we finally were about to give up I searched for a demo build of the coffee table and that was what got us to finish. I would buy again, but definitely watch a demo video on YouTube before you start building!",

                "reviewText": "I got this coffee table to match the tv stand. They look great together, but this coffee table doesn\u2019t really meet my expectations. It is a little smaller than I thought it would be, therefore the lift top does not come up as high as I would have hoped. The lift mechanic of the table is not the best quality either. It is hard to lift up, it feels like it sticks. And setting it down, it is extremely wobbly. When putting it together, my boyfriend and I had to sand some pieces to get it all to fit together. This was unfortunate because some of the drill holes were not placed correctly so that is why we had to fix it on our own. Unfortunately I feel like I am already on the hunt for something better.",

The hinge is buffered for lowering and raising, and the table conceals much of the crap that used to live on the couch. It's a fashionable piece, and for its $229 price point, demonstrates its value. It is indeed veneered particle board, but who cares? Originally reluctant to purchase, this welterweight coffee table is the newest bundle of joy in our family.",
