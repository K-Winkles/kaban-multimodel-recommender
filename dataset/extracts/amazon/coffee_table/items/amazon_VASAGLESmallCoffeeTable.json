They look really cute together, almost as nesting tables, and work really well separated as side tables. The tables do feel well made, fairly sturdy considering the price point (though I wouldn't sit on them), I do wish the tops could be secured to the base rather than just sit on them with the pegs but that's a small thing. The wood grain is nice, there is a hint of a stain/defect on the finish, perhaps from the packaging process, but it's only visible in a certain light when looking at them at a certain way, so not the end of the world. Would I buy them again or recommend them to someone looking for a cute decorative small table set for a smaller space? Absolutely. I wish they sold them in a larger size as well!!",
