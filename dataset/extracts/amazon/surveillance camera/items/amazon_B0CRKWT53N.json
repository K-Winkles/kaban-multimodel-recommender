                "reviewText": "I bought this camera to monitor the chain-link fence in my back yard as \"someone\" keeps vandalizing it. My yard is pretty small, but still within range of the camera's detection (30 - 50ft). I tried setting it up from inside the porch but the screen does impede it's detection ability (which I figured would happen). I mounted the camera outside my back porch and made sure to have it pointed and configured to pick up the motion at a distance over to the fence more so than closer to the house.I was confused a bit by the detection settings. Due to the distance, it was not working well with Human Detection enabled when I walked up and down the fence line and I only got one alert. It was not working incredibly well, so I tried all sorts of things- I ended up discovering if I turn OFF \"Human Detection\", it has a better chance of actually detecting humans at a distance (since they look smaller). After removing Human Detection, it was picking up a small palm tree in the back neighbor's yard whipping around when there were some heavy gusts that came through. I was happy with that level of detection. Not much goes on back there, so any alarm will be rare.The camera charged up nicely out of the box, and has been sitting at 100% for two days now. Since alarms will be rare in my scenario, I upped the recording time to 20 seconds. It is warned that the longer it's on and the longer it records, the more battery it uses up (which is a given anyway).You get 6 seconds of playback from anything stored in the cloud unless you want to pay $3.99 per month for full cloud access- so that is NOT free. You also have to pay for AI detection which is 2.99 per month or $1.99 per month for rolling months (auto renew). The app however, is free and looks and works great. I also installed a 128GB microSD card and it records to it flawlessly! I used my PC to wipe the microSD and format it to FAT. The camera then formatted the card for its use. I did a couple of test alerts, pulled the card, plugged it into my PC, and was able to view all of the videos in their entirety. Follow the directions that come with the camera that state to install the microSD card before you turn it on so that the camera is able to detect it. Formatting is done from the app after the camera is set up and the card is successfully detected.All in all, if the detection continues to function properly (my only worry at this point), this was well worth the price. I recommend you give it a try if you need occurrence security monitoring (not 24/7 security monitoring).",

                "reviewText": "The camera is pretty clear and has a lot of features for the price. Motion detection works great, night mode is pretty clear, and overall video quality is good. Setup is pretty easy and the app is easy to use as long as the wifi connection is strong where you have the camera set up. Catches movement and its easy to go scroll through the events and set up notifications as needed.",

                "reviewText": "Packaged nicely, set is a breeze! The best part is there is no wires or anything jus fully charge it after opening download the app connect to your wifi and that's it. I also have the doorbell camera from this company and I love that so much I wanted to get another for backyard when the kids are out playing. With that all I had to do was add a device on the app and now they are both connected on the same app super easy to switch back and forth from. The picture is very clear, night vision is great and sound is loud and clear. Battery seems to be long lasting after 2 days of having it up it is still at full battery. Definitelyy my favorite security system.",

                "reviewText": "I replaced a security camera I've had for 3 years with this one.I was very surprised how the tech in this camera is so far advanced over my 'old' one.Much easier to download the app onto my phone.I'm using an old Samsung Galaxy S9 - don't judge me... : )Wifi connection was a breeze.The CloudEdge app is well laid out and understandable.I can access an Installation Guide from within the app. (Not really needed though.)Clear image - I have mine set to the QHD setting (2560 x 1440). Very sharp.The other option is SD resolution - a decent image but QHD spoils a person.I put a 32 gig micro SD card in it - this can accept an up to 128 gig card.Card formatting is done through the Recording Management section of the app.It has motion detection, 2 way audio, different lighting options, siren and audio warning with strobe light.Also other stuff that can be controlled via the app. Nice to be able to turn alerts on or off depending on day/time/my mood.This has an internal battery which is still close to 100% after 4 days. Convenient to be completely wireless. I don't have it recording 24 hours a day though. Only when motion is detected and while I've been playing with the camera settings.It has a power port too so, if I want, I can keep it powered via the included USB cable and a (not included) standard wall USB adapter.I like the tripod female screw adapter on the bottom of the camera. I just grabbed one of my old tripods and screwed it in. It is flat on the bottom so I can also just set it on a table with no tripod. I also like that a mounting adapter and screws are included in case I want to mount it to a wall. The mounting adapter has a tripod screw so it's easy to take the camera off the wall mount and use it elsewhere temporarily if I want.Size is not huge - fits in my palm.Has some weight to it too, very well built.I also like the lifetime guarantee this company provides.I hope my review helps others decide if this is for them.",
