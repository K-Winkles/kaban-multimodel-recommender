                "reviewText": "One of the best outdoor cameras on the market.First impression - camera is bigger then I expected. But on other hand it should be bigger than some other outdoor cameras to have more space for solar batteries. Easy to install, very good night and day video quality, internal memory is 7Gb - can store a lot of video files.My house is located in the shade and in front of it is a big tree - not the perfect place to install this camera. Even in this so so conditions camera was working just fine. In three weeks battery discharged to 50%. Removed, charged batteries, placed camera back. There is also a choice to buy and connect additional solar charger.It will be a good idea to have ability to adjust lenses angle about 5-10 degree up and down. In my case about 5 degree down.Microphone is too sensitive, getting some background audio noise.Overall, this a perfect outdoor camera.",

Captures video as expected and charged itself thru solar panel. But quality of the image is a lot lower then the others but still a good product for the price. So far worked as expected but the battery life drained to less than 40% the last couple days due to rainy and cloudy. Hope it charged itself backup",

                "reviewText": "Your worries for security cameras that are wireless are normally battery life and detection. So far I have had no issues with this at all. Took only a few minutes to install after the initial charge, and it's been great. You can adjust the range of detection on the camera by clicking and dragging so even though I caught a tiny sliver of the street in the camera view, I can move the line over so that it doesn't go off when a car drives by. It's got sound and motion, human and pet detection. I love eufy cameras and was so glad to find this easy to install option for my front entryway outside.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. FINAL UPDATE: It has battery charging issues. I plugged it in to charge. I charged it to 100%. I mounted an external solar panel that is 100% in direct sunlight all day long. Its in a new position and it charged fine for a week or two then went back to having charging issues. It will not charge properly. Removed the solar panel and its the same thing. Charges correctly for awhile then stops. They need to reprogram the charging state. It seems after a few cycles it slow charges taking all day just to charge 1% if that. Something is also draining the battery according to their battery status idicator on the app. \ud83e\udd14 Not motion detection not live view it just says other. What is it? Is it busy sending data to some nefarious entity?The motion sensitivity also stays in the middle setting now. It won't change. The light no longer works with motion. It flashes and will not stay on nor will it record. A security camera that doesn't record. \ud83e\udd28 It lasted 2 months before the problems started. \ud83d\ude10 Can't recommend it. Too many bugs.UPDATE 2: Interesting. I placed the camera in direct sunlight without the external solar panel and it didn't charge. The 2nd day I turned the sensitivity down to the middle position and at high noon it started to charge. Whatha? ... Going to try this again to see if increasing the sensitivity is why it's not charging. Tried turning it off and nothing. So it may be the sensitivity. ... \ud83e\udd14UPDATE: Not ready for prime time solar charging. I purchased the Eufy solar panel to use with this since it's winter time and it wasn't in direct sunlight. The battery still drained faster than it could charge even when you turn off the camera. I thought the problem was not being in direct sunlight so I took it down charged it up placed it in direct sunlight and it still drains way faster than it can charge.I went through problem solving 4 times charging it moving it etc. It seems the problem is the camera. It worked great for a week or two then the charging problems occurred. It just won't charge. 2 months out and this has become annoying to have to take it down every few days to wall charge. \ud83e\udee4 It seems to not last. The charger or battery or both are not working the way it should. Also having less severe but similar issues with another Eufy solar cam. \ud83e\udd15 It seems to drain about 2% every hour and only charges 1.5% for the whole day. \ud83e\udd28 It dropped from 100% to 84% in direct sunlight the whole time. Simply put after 2 weeks it does not charge properly. Save yourself the $50 for an external solar panel that Eufy sells because it won't help. There seems to be a problem with the recharging hardware and or battery they use. \ud83e\udd14 Judging by the number of people having the same issue this is not reliable and needs work. I lost a $150 this camera and solar panel. Save your money until they fix the issue.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I like this camera it's solar powered with good image quality and the low light performance is way better than blink. In this video clip the light was off and the image was still clear. \ud83d\udc4cLove the fact it's all in one. No separate module to buy no memory stick needed no replacement batteries to purchase every few months and NO SUBSCRIPTION FEES! \ud83d\ude0eThe sensitivity is good picking up people walking about 75+ft away. The clips load up way faster than blink. The price is also reasonable.Let's talk about why it's not 5 stars. It started out recording cars and people from almost one side of the screen to the other giving a full recording of an event. But after a short while it starts mid way. \ud83e\udd28 So you're not getting a full or early enough detection. It's too slow to start recording and you're only seeing half of an event. \ud83d\ude10 It's probably easy to correct with an update because like I said when I 1st got it it recorded fully.The audio needs work. You can barely hear anything unless its right in front of the camera but there isn't much noise like Blink cameras. Some of the sound is articially sounding like a digital chop. But it picks up dogs n birds super clear. \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab Even though you turn off the status light there's a blue circle light always on. I want all power to the camera. Most people think it's just an LED light.They need a quick photo button to update the thumbnail so you can take a photo without going into the live feed. The POV could be a little wider and the zoom needs to be able to stay put. You can double tap and it zooms. Double tap again and it gets more zoomed but if you wanna go more you need to do the 2 finger stretch but as soon as you let go it bounces back to the last zoom. It doesn't stay all the way zoomed. \ud83e\udd14 When you zoom all the way it is pretty blocky n pixelated but the onboard preset zooms are pretty clear.During playback I can't FF or RW you can only pause n play and when you unpause it starts playback from the beginning starting all over. \ud83e\udd74 I want to be able to scan. I also want the ability to turn the light on without going into the live feed. When reviewing clips the clip you select needs to be highlighted so you know where you're at on the clips review screen so I know my place where I left off.Now about the solar panel. It does charge not being in direct sunlight but that charge is not faster than it drains. So it slowly drains the camera and you will need to take it down to recharge. No matter what some say you need to have this in direct sunlight or get a separate solar panel. This camera's battery drains even if you turn it off. \ud83e\udd14If you can place this in direct sunlight you probably won't have charging issues. In my case the sun is behind me so I needed an external solar panel so I can keep this above my garage door.Blink started to charge a subscription fee bait n switching on people and over pricing their new camera. Their new 4th gen is still only 1080p where this is 2K. \ud83e\udef5\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4d Bye bye Blink. \ud83d\udc4b",
