                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I purchased this camera to add pan/tilt functionality to a location on my property where I currently have a static wifi security camera. The unit comes well packed in a box that has security-seal stickers and a sealed outer wrapping, which are nice because all too often new device packages have no security features and you don't know if what you've bought is actually new. The camera itself has some heft to it - it's a bit heavier than similar cameras I have and feels quite substantial. The battery took 4 or 5 hours to charge to full capacity from its shipped condition and seems to be draining 2.5% a day without the solar panel connected (haven't used that yet so I can test the battery capacity).Camera installation was easy - a template is provided to locate the holes for the mounting bracket, and the camera twist-locks into the mount. I already had the required app installed because I use the same brand of doorbell. All I needed to do to get it running was add the camera to the device list; now both cameras are available in the one view, which is convenient. I use a wifi range extender for my cameras, so this one has no problem connecting to my network.The image quality, time to connect, and pan and tilt responsiveness are all very good. The zoom is of course digital, and while an optical zoom would be great, including that feature would probably triple the price.While the camera is excellent, it turns out that my favorite feature so far is the integrated motion sensing floodlight. It's very bright (though adjustable to a lower level if need be). The alley/corner area where I have the camera mounted is very dark at night and while I could put up a dedicated solar-powered light, it's great to have one included. All in all, the Mubview camera is well worth the modest cost. I may just get an additional one for another location.",

                "reviewText": "Switched from a poorly performing ring system to this & never looked back. After wasting weeks to install and get the spotlight pro to work, it kept draining too fast & the solar panel was a joke. At 1st it was a no brainer to go w/ Ring bc everyone did but their service failed so bad on top of increased annual fees, 2 devices = double the charge. Long story short it literally said on the box the solar panel EXTENDS the life of the battery, meaning it's inevitable to climb up there to fetch the battery. Noped out of the whole headache and installed this camera setup, not expecting much and BOY AM I GLAD I ditched my old system. This is not to bash Ring but in direct comparison this camera along with their doorbell not only have a sharper picture but perform much better overall. Cherry on top is zero fees & FULL BATTERY nonstop, once it's up that's it. I checked the battery consumption carefully and the panel does an outstanding job keeping it fully charged. Absolutely worth every penny, swivels around for an angle that covers the entire frontside of property (usually requires 2 cameras). The app is easy to navigate but could improve in simplicity of layout. The unit itself feels good quality, you'll love the taste of freedom!",

                "reviewText": "Excellent resolution, superior range and night vision, excellent support and customer service! Having owned 4 other brands of security cameras, I was surprised and pleased at the superior operation of the Mubview DX2 security camera, and I now have 2 of them plus 2 other fixed-mount Mubview cams. Easy to install and operate, this 2-antenna, remote-controlled camera delivers quick response, very high resolution and remarkable range when mounted at an impressive distance from my router. My \"Brand X\" cams could not compete with the Mubview cameras, either in resolution or range, and the DX2 is worth every penny. I have replaced all of my other security cams with Mubview cameras, as they offer lots of easy-to-use features along with actual software/hardware updates. The 2-way audio is very clear, making it easy to talk with visitors or delivery people without letting them know whether I'm actually home or not (even from as far away as France and Italy!). Mubview support is quick to respond to any questions and is very customer-oriented. I have recommended Mubview cameras to several friends and neighbors; you won't be disappointed!",

The siren and light flashes to let people know that it is starting to record. It has two way communication, you can speak and hear through it. The solar panel is great. The solar panel is always filled to 100% and works all night and morning non stop. It was easy to setup and the installation instructions were easy to understand.Also a great price this product !",
