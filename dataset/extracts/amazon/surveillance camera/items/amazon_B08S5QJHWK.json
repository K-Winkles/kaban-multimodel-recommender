                "reviewText": "Great camera. I bought this to upgrade from a 1080p camera I already had. The 5MP camera is much clearer in live view, but I don\u2019t see a tremendous difference on recorded video, although it is better. The 5MP camera has a wider field of view so this one shows about an 80\u2019 wide area at a distance of 40\u2019. Perfect for my particular application.",
