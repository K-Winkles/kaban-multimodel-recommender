                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I like that it was easy to install. The night vision works pretty good as well. The picture is pretty clear which surprised me I thought it would be more grainy. I gave it four stars but I think more like three and a half. The down sides are they made programming smart lights to the camera a little too hard. I\u2019ve been trying to figure it out for a few days now. I sat here for three hours trying to figure it out. I want the lights to come on when the camera detects motion or sound. I also wish it had a motion tracker. I had another camera that tracker objects moving around the room. Which is pretty cool. I also wish it was compatible with more brands and smart home apps you\u2019re really limited to Feit electric app. The others I found it works you just can\u2019t use all the functions like in the Feit app. But it is very much worth it. Paid less than thirty and a major plus side you don\u2019t need a subscription for an app to use what you\u2019ve already bought. I spent almost three times as what I paid for this on Rokus camera and lights and it honestly wasnt worth what you pay and then the charge you for a subscription. If you want to keep the memory you have to buy a SD digital memory card which aren\u2019t very expensive you can get one cheap on Amazon less than ten dollar I paid about weight started with 69 gb I\u2019ve been using it for going to two weeks and it\u2019s down to 57 gb so it will last a good while. Just be careful choosing the right one I\u2019ve heard more complaints and issues with the higher memory capacity cards they\u2019re buying cheap. I bought scan disk. I haven\u2019t had an issue at all.. they\u2019re not that much more expensive.. if you can find a smart device that\u2019s more compatible with other devices at a good price then I would go with it. But I would definitely recommend this product it\u2019s worth what I paid and so far I\u2019m happy with it",

                "reviewText": "These cameras (I currently own 3 of them and am getting 2 more) are absolutely fantastic. Buy a 128gig memory card to put in as they don't come w/one. Easy to set up. Tilt, pan,ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC night vision clarity.In the future, Feit has told me they hope to be able to partner w/monitoring companies as currently their products are not compatible w/any professional monitoring company. Motion sensing and sound detection. The sound detection is a bit too sensitive so any passing car (these are indoor use cameras) or central air will be picked up even at the lowest sensitivity le el. This is an area for improvement. You can talk through them and listen (2-way audio).thee offer great sense of security while you are away. I have one in the attic of my grandparents' home that has previously had squirrels. I have a live trap in the attic and a camera on the trap. Can see if anything is going on. I also have a racoon that tried to chew through the roof. So i places a live trap outside w/in view of the outdoor security light camera and that way,, i can tell when i have caught it.. dont want to keep trapped in a cage any longer than necessary..This company has many great products (no, I don't work for them) and so far I use MANY of their smart bulbs (can purchase at Costco), smart plugs (Costco) and security camera flood-lights (Costco). The app is easy to use and I see nothing but good stuff for them as they expand. Customer service is top notch!",

I had to turn off the status light because...cats...but you can turn on notifications in case it goes offline. The toughest part has been trying to put it where they don't bother it, and it is secured. Still working that out, but that's a me problem, not a product problem. The pan feature makes this so versatile. Highly recommended!",
