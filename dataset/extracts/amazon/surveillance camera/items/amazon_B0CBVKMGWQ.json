Just unscrew the lightbulb where you want to install this, screw this device in and setup was a breeze. It connects to my wifi with no problems. The quality of the camera is super clear and sound is great! The intercom feature is nice too, loud and clear. Pet and person detection is an added feature that is nice. Absolutely happy with the value for the money and would not hesitate to purchase again.",

                "reviewText": "This lightbulb camera is great for those who want to install one with minimal effort. It screws into any standard E40 light lightbulb socket. If using a flood lamp socket you may need to purchase a small extension to clear any socket obstruction. They sell those extensions very cheaply on Amazon. The camera app lets you pan 360 degrees and up and down so you have a pretty good view of the entire surroundings. The camera will also track moving objects. The tracking is not the best but pretty sure with firmware updates the tracking will improve. You can also improve tracking if you select human tracking only. You get 3 days of event recording in the cloud for free. If you decide you want more days then you will need a subscription. You can also add a 128 GB micro SD card which will record 24/7 for free. The camera does not require replacing or charging any batteries since you are connecting it to a light socket. You just screw it in and follow the instructions on the mobile app. It's very simple to get it going. The video quality is in high definition and also has MagicPix which gives the video some dynamic range similar to HDR. It also has a security light that will activate after dawn if an event is triggered. Overall this lightbulb camera is well worth the money. I would recommend it to someone who needs to keep an eye on their property.",

                "reviewText": "This camera was a pleasant surprise. I didn't expect so many features in that price range. Instructions were clear and ez. The entire process to connect the camera took less than 5 minutes. I choose the free plan which limits cloud storage but I use an SC card, which inserts on the bottom of the unit, so it records a lot and I can delete as needed. Three options for sensitivity of motion is good to avoid leaves blowing setting it off, pictures are very clear. You can choose to be notified of motion, or just check it manually. It has a speak through option and ability to sound an alarm - very useful for scaring off unwanted wildlife. I was happy to find a rotate image option because I wanted to put in an upright lamp instead of ceiling or wall socket. The only con is it does not zoom in the live mode. The wifi connection is pretty good up to about 60 ft from the router, I tried one too far and couldn't connect it. That said, I actually bought two of these. The first one was defective but the company responded asap, and replaced within days. I can view both cameras from the same screen, and opt to put one to sleep if desired. I live in the mountains and got them primarily to notify me of bears, etc. For my needs, they do the job well. Overall, a good investment and good value.",

The quality of both video and photo are very vibrant and detailed the ability to articulate the camera from left to right up and down. Also works smoothly. The zoom in and out. Focus works very well. I will be purchasing more of these to install in different applications, I also connected this to my backyard on my deck, and it gave incredible video images and the fact that it has a light that you can turn on at night makes it an even more valuable security camera.",

                "reviewText": "This camera was so easy to set up and get working. The night vision is superb! There is an option for color night vision by turning on the white light. The white light option also works great as a regular lighting fixture. The audio is magnificent. The camera does not miss a beat. There is also the option to detect people only which is great. There is a motion tracking feature which I really like. It tracks the movement to the point the object becomes out of range and then the camera goes back to the original watchpoint. For example, if the camera is set to watch my door and someone comes in through that door and moves around, the camera will keep tracking that person until they move out of the camera's range. Then after a while, (maybe 30sec-1min, I didn't time it but it's not long) the camera goes back to watching the door. So far I am not being forced to subscribe to anything so that's great. You won't regret buying this. it also works great in the rain.",
