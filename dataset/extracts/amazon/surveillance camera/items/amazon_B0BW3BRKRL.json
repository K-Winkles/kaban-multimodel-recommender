                "reviewText": "I have to tell you, setting up the Rebluum 2K Solar Security Camera was like hosting a welcoming party for a Martian rover. My backyard turned into a landing site for this extraterrestrial sentinel \u2013 packing some serious tech chops beneath its 'out-of-this-world' design. First things first, the camera speaks fluent 'Wireless' with a strong accent in '2.4Ghz WiFi.' The only cords you'll see here are the metaphorical ones attaching you to peace of mind. This little beauty loves nothing more than to chat with your router all day, sharing what it sees with seamless clarity.This sunny sentinel is a true green-thumbs-up for Mother Nature! Powered by our friendly neighborhood star \u2013 the Sun \u2013 it slurps up the rays by day and keeps a vigilant eye by night. It\u2019s like a solar-powered owl that\u2019s traded hunting mice for spotting mischief. Now, let's talk about its nocturnal vision. I switched off the lights and BOOM, my garden was drenched in an eerie, but reassuring glow. The Color Night Vision is like having a friendly raccoon that never sleeps, always alert and ready to squeal (or, you know, send alerts to your phone) at the slightest whiff of trouble.The motion detection feature is as keen as a border collie on espresso. It's smart, attentive, and doesn't waste time barking up the wrong tree. With precise and accurate alerts, you won't be bothered by false alarms set off by those rebellious autumn leaves blowing across your yard. What\u2019s better than a security camera? A security camera with a voice, of course! The two-way audio turns this camera into the ultimate communicator. Whether you want to greet the delivery guy, startle a potential trespasser, or just remind your spouse they promised to water the plants - your voice now has range and reach!With the SD Card and Cloud Service, it's like having a personal scribe, diligently jotting down everything it sees, ready to replay at your whim. No more worrying about running out of memory - this Martian marvel has enough room to store your very own backyard soap opera. All in all, the Rebluum 2K Solar Security Camera is a perfect blend of advanced tech and eco-friendliness, acting as a faithful watchdog for your property, but without the slobber. Whether you're home or away, day or night, this camera shines as a beacon of safety, powered by the very star that nurtures life on our planet. Now that\u2019s what I call bringing light to security!",

                "reviewText": "As a 78 year old, and pretty ignorant about technology and cell phones, I am impressed with the ease of use of this security camera. I was concerned that the batteries would not be sufficient to last the night. But after the first couple of nights of use, there was absolutely no problem. Even in early April with longer nights, and short days, there was no shortage of power. I do live in the high desert, so the quality of sunlight is no problem. The angle of view is able to cover from the front door, the drive way, and to the edge of the street about 35 feet away. I did not set it for human detection, we get a lot of wildlife such as deer, horses, racoons, and even the occasional bear. I was interested in watching their activity. I wanted to be notified for any movement. I get notified with automobile passage, but we get so little traffic, that is not a problem. The night vision is very clear to at least 40 feet, which covers to the edge of the property. I have had no reason to use the two way audio, but I did test it, and I am sure any nefarious people would depart immediately when challenged. The wireless connection was the hardest part for me, I was not familiar with networks, and WiFi. Luckily, the next door neighbors son came over, and had me up and running in no time. He said I needed to connect 2.4. I am not using the cloud storage, just the memory card, which is working flawlessly. The quality of video is amazing in both day and night. The night capability is good enough, that I believe the identification of an individual would be possible from a significant distance. This is the security camera for the novice technical guy. No complicated wiring, and once the settings are made, it pretty much runs itself. I strongly recommend this camera for the value for money. I am showing it, and recommending it, to the neighbors.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great little security camera for outdoors. There are several features that I truly like. The ability to not have to charge. It is wonderful. I wish everything had solar panels attached to them. This outdoor security camera gives you the ability to have two way communication, which is definitely a plus. You also have the ability to pan and tilt which gives you a much greater range to view and keep secure. This camera has night vision and the ability to store, images and videos on an SD card or directly to a cloud. This camera is easy to install and easy to set up as well. Love.",
