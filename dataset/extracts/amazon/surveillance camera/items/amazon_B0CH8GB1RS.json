I have a few others from different manufacturers and they can differ in many ways. this one has all the bells and whistles like pan and tilt and night vision and all that. the app itself has a ton more options when you get into it. the could service is only a few dollars a month so I went for it. nice not having to rely on the internal SD card to get my images in case the camera is damaged or whatnot. especially if its stolen there goes my images, so having the cloud is worth it. the motion detection works well, the camera swivels fast to keep up with me when I walk by, pretty neat. for the price I am thinking of getting a few more so I can connect them to one screen and see everything at once.",

                "reviewText": "Setup was pretty strait forward if you are used to these sorts of devices. Once connected to the app, it was super easy to pan and tilt the camera. For those who are wondering, the micro-SD card slot is under the lens. You just have to tilt the camera up to expose it. Would make a nice inside camera for keeping an eye on things, and the night vision works as expected. This little thing is dirt cheap too.Only 2 little gripes though. The night vision cutover can be adjusted, but not turned off. If you are planning on pointing this out a window, you won't be able to avoid the IR reflections when it hits night time. The other little issue I had was with the SD card. Once it begins recording on the card, I was unable to get the card to read on my Windows PC. Put it back in the camera, and it's fine, so it must have some proprietary formatting. Even formatting card on my PC, putting it in the camera, and then trying to read it on the PC again failed. This becomes an issue if your camera dies and you need to retrieve footage. I was able to replicate this using different cards, so keep that in mind.",

                "reviewText": "I was pleasantly surprised with this camera. I think this is a pretty good camera for the price. I was a little hesitant when I went to connect the camera to the wifi. I was worried the setup was going to be difficult.But the setup was simple. And I didn't have any issues. The camera has an app the user can download on to their phone. So you can check the camera at any time from anywhere. I found the app to be user friendly. The camera is 1080p HD so the picture is good quality. It also has night vision which is always nice to have. And the 2 way audio is nice and crisp.. it's actually a lot better quality than my other camera. The camera is touch screen so it's simple to navigate. You can pan the camera in the which ever direction you'd like it to be. This camera gives you an option to either purchase a monthly Cloud subscription or use a SD card. The monthly subscription service keeps your data for a given period of time and you pay monthly. I chose to use an SD card because I didn't want to pay for a monthly subscription. And the SD card keeps plenty of storage for my needs. Overall I think this is a pretty good camera especially for the price. And I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality camera at an affordable price.",

This camera does the job, I do not use it for baby surveillance or any room monitoring instead, I installed it on the inside of the glass window for outer surveillance. This camera does the job quite well. It was easy to install and setup with the \"iCsee\" mobile app that contains all basic features like camera tilt/panning, motion tracking, real-time video monitoring, two-way communication (which I don't need), recorded or video playback, notifications, turn on recording manually, taking snapshots and others. You can also create a shortcut for the camera from the app on your iPhone to quickly open the camera with one tap which I liked. It records continuously to my storage micro SD card (bought separately) plus, it can also record and upload my recordings to their cloud storage when I buy their subscription plans. The video is nice, something that you can expect from an FHD camera. Since I have installed it on my glass window for outdoor monitoring on the second floor, it is too far for the motion detection to work perfectly, so I can't comment on that in detail. One thing I want to mention is that, when I try to tilt/pan the camera through the mobile app, it is not smooth movement, it takes minor steps and does not move smoothly. I never tried using Alexa.",
