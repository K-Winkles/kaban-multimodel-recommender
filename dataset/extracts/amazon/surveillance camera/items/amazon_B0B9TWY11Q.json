Thought about buying another ring camera since I already have a paid subscription and 8 other cameras but decided to give this a try because it's much cheaper. After setting this up i now wish I had bought more of these instead of ring cameras. Picture is excellent in light and dark. It pans and zooms easily. It even has an option to follow movements. This thing locked onto me and followed me as moved around the garage. It's amazing. I will be replacing the ring cameras with these.",

                "reviewText": "I'm very happy with this camera. Quality and functionality (even at the no subscription plan) are great, and install (indoors, was easy.)The camera includes the mount, a nice length of power cord, a block for the cord to plug in, and the hardware you need to install the mount if you choose to go that route. The mount includes a little sticker which lines up where you need to drill, which is extremely handy. Note, if you're installing this outside, and the plug will be outside, the box says there's an outdoor plug that you need to buy separately.For where I mounted this, install was super easy and fast, and the quality is good, and the nightvision is great too. Full pan, tilt, zoom, and if you opt for it (my install this wasn't ideal, but still a cool feature) the camera can even automatically track motion, moving pan and tilt to follow something that's moving, which like I said, I have turned off for what I'm using this cam for, but it's a cool feature to have.For the price, this is a great camera, and I'd more than recommend it. I've got cameras from many other brands (Roku, Ring, etc.) and this one works just as well as all of those, for significantly less in price (which is perfect for the project I'm using this cam for.",

                "reviewText": "I do not want to pay for a monthly subscription which is why I originally purchased 2 Arlo cameras. I purchased the WYZE Cam Pan v3 to replace my Arlo Essential Spotlight Camera which I liked until it stopped recording video and only provided a still image of the last motion event detected. Apparently, you couldn't see the previous events or get video unless you paid for the subscription. The other camera I have is the Arlo Pro 2 with a doorbell. This camera still performs well and records all motion events without a subscription, and you get to keep them for 7 days. The Arlo cameras are rechargeable, and the doorbell takes AA. The new WYZE is wired which is good for my application, so I don't have to recharge it any longer. This is a great camera, is reasonably priced, has great picture quality and by installing an SD card, you can get 24/7 recordings. I installed a 64GB SD card which allows for 4 days of 24/7 recording before it starts to write over the data. A larger one will give you more days. My only negative is that without the subscription it will only notify you of an event in 5-minute increments. You still have the recording but if an event happened 2 minutes after one you will not know it happened unless you watch a full 5 minutes after each event. I'm okay with that limitation since I don't have to pay the monthly $2.99 fee per camera. If you pay for the whole year, it averages out to $1.67. per camera. As I purchase more cameras to add to my system, I will get the WYZE CAM 3 as I realized I don't need and don't care for the pan option. I turned off that function.",

                "reviewText": "Review is on 2023-03-12.Having owned the Wyze Cam V3 as my introduction to the brand - moving to the Pan V3 was almost a natural path. It's a great camera for a great price. The bulk of the company's money seems to be made on the subscription side, so the hardware price is sold with minimal markup it seems.The camera itself - hardware and quality - are not much different from the regular V3. Good picture quality and such. There are 3 primary differences between the Pan and the regular V3.1 - Panning capability. The camera can turn - not 360 - but almost.2 - Not magnetic. Must be mounted on the provided base - or similar item that the screw can fit.3 - Micro USB cable is right angle and not straight.PANNINGThe camera can turn almost in 360 degrees on the base. It has what's called \"waypoints\" where 4 areas can be set and the camera will automatically move to each area once selected within the app.The camera supports time-lapse and motion following.NOT MAGNETICIf you wanted something similar to the regular V3 that you could stick somewhere - this won't do. Based on viewing the Pan V2 - they are similar in terms of the base. This does make some sense since the base can swivel, but it's something worth noting.USB CABLEThe regular V3 has lots of cables available that are weatherproof. Finding one for the Pan V3 - and I guess the V2 as well - is very tedious. The right-angle cable needs to sit inside the base of the camera and I've not found any extensions that have this feature. If you're going to purchase a third-party cable, you need to ensure that the micro USB end is about 19mm/0.75in so that it will fit snugly inside the base of the camera. This means you MUST use the original cable. I've not seen a similar right-angle cable on Amazon or even on the Wyze website - so there's no replacement. Another option - which I've done - is to buy an extension cable that is compatible with the device. I had a regular USB2.0 extension cable and it didn't work - guess it doesn't carry the voltage as well. Waiting on the linked device to arrive and test.https://a.co/d/3dER0lLI assume I'll either have to heat-shrink or tape the connection between the original cable and the extension. If someone else has seen the cable or something that will work - please link it within your review or as a reply to this one. The items below were found on the Wyze forums and linked here to make things easier.CABLEhttps://a.co/d/4ravLGoTAPEhttps://a.co/d/ceonpX3Additionally - if you're technically inclined - you could cut the cable and solder it to a different extension. Persons have said in the Wyze forums that it's only power - no data - so just 2 wires are required. Do that at your own risk.UPDATE - 2024-01-02So now. Having had the device for some time, I've used and abused it a bit and have more details to add for the review. Both the V3 and the PAN has had some weird issues for me. I'll get into those individually.V3 - I recently decided to go on vacation and didn't want my cat to be left without food. While my current solar setup isn't 100% - it provides enough power until about 2AM and the area is secure enough that a dead gap isn't a problem. I really just need the cameras to monitor my cat. So a typical \"pspspspspsps\" call to get the cat to come around is used along with the name - but strangely, the camera seems to cut out with errors once this is done. Almost like it dies - has some firmware issue - or something. I'm going to test and see if it's the sound or pitch, but I've really not tested voice on any of the cameras for more than a few seconds previously. To get the attention of my cat I need like 1-2 minutes per camera. When the camera goes offline, it needs to be manually power cycled in order to be available again. Since my solar setup dies and comes back, that works out for the V3 somewhat, but it's concerning that the cameras have a flaw where extended voice or a sound/pitch will cause them to suddenly go offline. You may need to test this with your own cameras to verify.PAN - the V3 PAN has an even stranger issue. While it seems to share the same issue as above, it also seems to factory reset the device if there's the audio function usage or even periodic power cuts - which happens based on the solar setup I've got going as explained above. Again, this is concerning. I have to climb up on a ladder to physically reset the device and rescan the QR code to have the camera available again. This is very inconvenient.With those problems in mind, I think WYZE should have an option to \"re-add\" a camera that's giving issues. That way any existing configurations including waypoints can be kept and you don't have to do everything over from scratch - including sharing the camera with family members if you do that.Again - hopefully this review helps and persons can be aware of potential flaws. Overall - still a great camera and the functions of the PAN are good.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Resumen 2024.01.01: Excelente camara con funciones varias sin pagar.Compre 2 camaras (para empezar). Me interesaba el \"360\".Las camaras vienen bien protegidas. Trae camara, cable, cuadro de energia (5V 2A), manual, chilillos de montaje, base para montar en pared/techo.De inicio cuando las conectas se mueven, bajas la aplicacion y fueron faciles de instalar y usarlas. Por defecto tiene activado el \"Track Motion\". Le puse una memoria de 64GB. La app es facil de usar y entender. La camara se ve de buen material, se ve bien hecha y resistente.La calidad de grabacion es decentemente buena, puedes cambiar a 360 o 720.Los movimientos al girar la camara son suaves, puedes ver las grabaciones facilmente, acceder a ella rapidamente, grabar videos o fotos, puedes darle zoom, poner zonas de grabacion, configurar horarios, eventos, soporta IFTTT, eventos por geolocalizacion (al parecer solo USA y Canada) y otras. Las funciones avanzadas las desconozco, ya que son de paga y basicamente son: guardar en la.nube, sensores de reconocimiento avanzado, acceder por la pagina web de Wyze y otras que no.recuerdo.Las voy a poner en el exterior y te sugieren (obligado) comprar un adaptador para exterior. Si tienes conocimientos basicos puedes hacer tu propia \"caja\" para poner el cuadro de energia cerca de la camara.Finalmente, soportan el protocolo RTSP, el cual te permite usarlo con aplicaciones de 3ros, NVR y/o Home Assistant, incluso como camara web. Solo que lei que aun no sale.un firmware para este modelo, seguire leyendo e investigando.2024.01.11.Con una memoria de 64GB graba aproximadamente 5 a 11 dias.La exterior tiene 5 diasLa interior tiene 11 diasAmbas configuradas de la misma manera (HD, grabacion continua, sonido, eventos, vision nocturna).Supongo la diferencia principal es que con luz graba a 20FPS, y en modo nocturno graba a 15FPS, asi que la interior casi siempre tiene menos luz.",
