I like that it has the option to record on internal memory and comes with the plug and everything else you need to download whatever videos you want. Good buy.",

                "reviewText": "This is a pretty straightforward version of a nanny-cam except it's disguised as a phone charger adapter. I can see a number of uses for this device: 1) keeping an eye on the babysitter while you're out; 2) keeping an eye on pets while away; or 3) keeping an eye on your motel room while away.You can just plug it in with a mini-sd card and it'l take photos out the box. Or you could pair it with your phone's wifi and monitor from another room. Or you could pair to your router and watch from anywhere in the world.I recommend trying to get the device to an outlet that's as close to chest or eye level as possible. Lower outlets don't give as good a view. Also, if the camera is obscured by a charger cable, it won't capture a clean image. Something to consider.Something else to consider: be sure you're not placing this in areas that aren't legally yours to monitor.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very cool product that actually works. You scan the QR code on the paper they give you to download the app and through the app you can connect the spy camera to your phone. The camera is discreet and you wouldn't be able to notice it unless you were super close to it. The only reason this gets a 4 star and not 5 stars is because the app is buggy and would constantly close on me randomly when I was testing out the camera.",
