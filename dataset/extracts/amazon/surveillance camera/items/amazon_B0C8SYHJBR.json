                "reviewText": "Let me tell you, this camera is a total game-changer for keeping an eye on things!First off, the night vision is like something out of a spy movie. It's got this infrared magic that captures clear shots even in the pitch dark. No more worrying about what's happening outside when the lights go out. And during the day? Oh man, the colors pop, and you can practically zoom in to read license plates from a couple driveways away. It's like having a high-tech detective right on your property. But wait, there's more! The camera can move around like it's on a dance floor. The pan-tilt feature lets you control it from your phone using the easy to use Wansview App, so you can see everything happening in a wide area. Super handy, especially if you've got a big place to watch over. I took several pictures with the same camera after panning/tilting it to show that I can easily cover both sides of my street.Now, the real kicker \u2013 solar power. Yep, this bad boy comes with its own mini solar panel. No more stressing about changing batteries or dealing with complicated wiring. It soaks up the sun during the day, keeping your battery strong even in places without a power outlet. The best part... I can disconnect the solar panel, and charge other stationary cameras that accept a USB-C port (these cameras also use the same Wansview App).Setting it up was a breeze, too. The app is user-friendly, and you can check what's going on from anywhere. Total win! If you're into smart and hassle-free security, this cam's your new best friend.",

                "reviewText": "I have a couple areas on my property I want to monitor, but with no electrical outlets nearby, I needed something solar. After lots of research, I decided on this one and I\u2019m SO glad I did! It\u2019s absolutely perfect for my needs. It has a huge range of view with the pan and tilt, and I can monitor a very large chunk of my property. It works great even at night, and because it\u2019s solar powered, there are no long extension cords criss-crossing my yard to where I needed it.Installation was a breeze. I charged it up before installing it since it\u2019s fall in Wisconsin and sun is sporadic. With a full charge, I followed the instructions and it was installed and I was watching video on my phone in under 10 minutes. It\u2019s staying charged very well from the sun, but if winter in Wisconsin brings too many days of dark, I love that I can quick charge it up again with a cord. Solar can be tricky in winter, but this seems to be charging great even with limited sunlight!The picture is clear, and I love the two way audio. I had a raccoon try to get into my duck pen the second night I had it. The motion alert, which I had set on, alerted me. I flipped open the app on my phone and saw the little bugger trying to get in. I hit the microphone and started yelling, and he took off screaming across the yard! I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be back again! LOLIf you\u2019re looking for a great all-around security camera for areas with limited power, this is the one. Five big stars!",

                "reviewText": "This Cinnado camera is part of the Wansview family of cameras. They use the Wansview app to view, operate, and configure.Setup is very easy, just follow the prompts on the Wansview app EXACTLY and the camera will be up and running in under a minute. One thing to note is that battery-powered cameras such as these do not have RTSP video streaming so cannot be used with Zoneminder, but they can be used with Google Home or Alexa (I did not try either one).I bought the 2-pack and put one camera outside aiming at the rear entry door of my house, powered by the solar panel and the other camera is inside aiming at the same door and not connected to any power source (using internal battery only).The outdoor cam has a 32G micro SD card installed and is set to record motion events while the indoor cam is connected to wifi and is for viewing only. I've used just over half gig of storage in 24 days in the outdoor camera. When the card eventually fills the camera is set to overwrite older files.Battery life is fantastic. As a test, the indoor camera was charged with a standard USB-C phone charger for 24 hours and on 12/7/23 put into service. As of 12/26/23 the camera is still working and showing 100% battery. Even if the battery gauge is inaccurate, running 19 days so far on only it's internal battery is amazing. The outdoor camera has never shown less than 97% battery as the solar panel keeps it charged even after a few days of cloudy and rainy conditions. Also, the outdoor camera has been set to turn on it's white lights for 15 seconds when motion is detected so it should use more power than the indoor one. You don't have to worry about these cameras running out of power.Picture quality is excellent. The 2K resolution combined with a good lens make these probably the best security cameras I own for video quality. I'm not sure of the lens focal length, but it does not fisheye like a 1.7mm and the view is wider than a 3mm. It's the proper angle-of-view for typical suburban home use (in my opinion). At night the infrareds light up the area just fine and the option to turn on the white lights when motion is detected (and the video then records in color) is an added benefit.I am so impressed by these cameras that, even though I cannot link them to my Zoneminder central monitoring system via RTSP I will use internal micro SD storage and the Wansview app to have a second security 'system' to complement my existing Zoneminder setup. Like the other Wansview cameras I have, these B6's so far have been operating perfectly with no glitches or lockups. I will update this review once I find out exactly how long the camera lasts on it's internal battery. Impressive!",
