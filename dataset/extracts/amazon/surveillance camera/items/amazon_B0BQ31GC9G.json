Camera is bright and clear , motion detection is working as it should and at medium setting I get no false detection. At high motion detection I do get bird/squirrels setting it off because it reaches further, at medium it works very well for my situation. The view at night is very clear in b&w . I have not tried the color yet but will. Audio is unexpectedly pretty darn good also. The fact that I do not have to subscribe to a monthly fee unless I want the premium features is what sold me on this camera, all the other great things are a big bonus. The free program is just fine with me, it alerts when someone approaches the zone and records for the record. Ordered a second one which came overnight for the front door , need to install tomorrow, installation was a breeze and took about 10 minutes. Wifi signal is strong and has been connected constantly .......no problems there. If you are looking for barebones,no cost, simple hook up and reliable , this is it.",

                "reviewText": "I am very impressed with this camera. I have had cameras costing five times as much that can't come close. The picture quality is amazing. As you can see in the photos it has a good wide angle view and is clear for a long distance. I am very amaze at the distance the motion censor can reach. I get notifications every time a vehicle enters our road or a person walks down it. This is great as we have a drug dealer living down the road from us and traffic becomes extremely heavy a few times a month. We live in the middle of nowhere in a small community of right at 200. Our police officer is in with the drug dealers and thieves and that's the reason I needed better cameras. I can put the videos on my computer and expand them to get tag numbers of people going down to the drug house and give them to the Feds.At night it performs great as well. The lights can literally turn night into day. The alarm works great as well as the two way speaker.Solar panel works great with or without sun. The battery is always full.I get notifications sent to my phone every time the motion sensor is set off and I can see live video no matter where I am, even 300 miles away at my daughter's.We have had some extreme storms recently and a few days where the heat index reached 114. Neither reduced performance.As an ex police officer and security specialist I highly recommend this camera to everyone. Comes with everything you need for a fast and easy installation. It took me less than 15 minutes to set it up and installed. There is also a micro SD card slot. The app is easy to use and you can record and delete video any time you want.These cameras were well thought out when designed. You can't go wrong with these. I'm going to be ordering several more over the next month to cover my entire property. Two thumbs up to the manufacturer.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this camera to monitor my house entrances and I am very satisfied with its performance. The camera is easy to install and connect to the app. The solar panel keeps the battery charged and I don\u2019t have to worry about running out of power. The camera has a clear picture quality, both day and night. The spotlights are bright and the color night vision is impressive. The motion detection is sensitive and accurate, and I get alerts on my phone whenever there is any activity. The two-way audio is also clear and loud. The camera is waterproof and durable, and it has survived some heavy rain and snow. The cloud and SD storage options are convenient and secure. The app is user-friendly and has many features and settings to customize the camera. The customer service is responsive and helpful. Overall, I think this is a great camera for the price and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and affordable outdoor security camera.",

                "reviewText": "This camera caught my eye when I was looking at the different options. Was leaning toward some of the more common, but expensive systems until I found this. It is great quality, uses a solar panel, so it can be independent of power, has color image and great night vision imaging. It also has a speaker that can alarm, or you can talk through using the app. Also, the app is user friendly and alerts are quick. The ability to set your detection area patterns yourself helps if you don't want plants that blow in the wind to be detected. You can also set it to detect and alert for cars, people and animals. Also, you can pay a little extra for cloud storage or insert a mini SD card and jot pay anything extra. Cloud storage is a couple dollars a month and is worth it. You can also manually clear the videos or they will erase when the storage gets full, last video first. Been operating it for nearly a month and found it to be reliable and easy to use. Also, kinda fun messing with the cats when you speak through the camera and they don't know where it is coming from, or the stray cat that runs when I say \"here kitty kitty\"! It is a great system, expandable, and can't beat it for the price.",
