I encountered a connecting problem with the camera, but the customer service team went above and beyond to ensure my issue was promptly resolved.Upon receiving the bulb-camera, I was excited to install and connect it to my home network. However, I faced some difficulties in getting it connected. I reached out to the customer service team, explaining my problem, and they responded promptly with troubleshooting suggestions. Unfortunately, my attempts didn't resolve the issue.To my surprise, the customer service representative then offered to send me another set of cameras to ensure I could enjoy the product as intended. This level of attentiveness and dedication to customer satisfaction was truly impressive. The replacement cameras arrived promptly, and the setup process was a breeze.The bulb-camera itself is outstanding. It provides excellent image quality, both during the day and at night. The 360-degree panoramic view covers a wide area, and the motion detection feature works flawlessly. I also appreciate the ability to access the camera remotely via the dedicated app, which allows me to monitor my home from anywhere.The camera's built-in microphone and speaker enable two-way audio communication, adding an extra layer of security and convenience. The mobile app is intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy to navigate and adjust settings to suit my preferences.Overall, I am highly impressed with the quality of the bulb-camera and even more so with the exceptional customer service I received. The company's willingness to go the extra mile to resolve my connecting issue by resending another set of cameras demonstrates their commitment to customer satisfaction.I highly recommend this bulb-camera to anyone seeking a reliable and high-performing surveillance solution for their home. With excellent image quality, easy setup, and outstanding customer service, this product has exceeded my expectations.",

If the wifi drops, it wont record. You also have to pay for cloud storage, but if you do not pick the most expensive package, it will hold the features you did pay for hostage for a few days as it tries to convince you to upgrade. Its motion sensor is crap, it will send me endless notifications about the leaf on the branch across the driveway, but it doesn't catch my daughter walking across the driveway and into the house. Even if you pay for cloud storage it will not record continuously...and as above mentioned...it is super random about what it does and doesn't choose to record. I tried contacting customer support, but received no answer.Please save yourself some aggravation and try something else.",

                "reviewText": "I was originally plan to return these devices, however, after give them a few more days try, I think it actually provides a good value at the price. I change my rating from 3 star to 4 star. I will update about a month later after my free cloud subscription expires.I have mix of positives and notable drawbacks. Initially, the affordability coupled with a satisfactory camera quality and straightforward installation process seemed promising.The design flaw in the SD card slot raises serious concerns. The poor design makes it perilously easy for the card to be mistakenly inserted, leading to a frustrating scenario where the card can literally be 'eaten' by the camera. Unfortunately, this issue occurred with both of the cameras I purchased.Compounding the frustration is the limited compatibility with SD card sizes. The camera's optimal performance is restricted to cards with 32GB and below, rendering my 128GB card unrecognized\u2014an unexpected and inconvenient hiccup.Moreover, the subscription model further dims the appeal of this product. Despite having an SD card slot, playback options are restricted solely to the cloud with no access to local storage without a subscription. This limitation means that even though notifications are received, viewing the actual video content becomes impossible without committing to an ongoing subscription. While it's technically possible to search the SD card by timestamp, the associated hassle makes it an impractical alternative.In conclusion, while the camera initially appeared promising, the combination of motor noise, design flaws in the SD card slot, and subscription limitations ultimately led to my decision to return the product. Potential buyers should weigh these factors carefully based on their specific needs and preferences before making a purchase.",

                "reviewText": "These bulb cameras are super convenient because you don't have mount it to the wall etc. Just screw in to a light bulb base and you are done. I have a vacation home in the south that I need to monitor. I put up multiple cameras around the house so that I can see what\u2019s going on all the time. The night vision and resolution are impressive. Depends on when you bought it, you may app HoMeYe Pro or Yi IoT. If you are not using their cloud subscription, the local SD card storage works fine. I used 128G SD cards, it can store many days of recording. One tip, after you put in a new SD card, you may have to do format-reboot a couple of times to get it recognized if it reports errors. Of course this would not concern those who use their cloud service.",
