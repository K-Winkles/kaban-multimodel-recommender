Being able to talk to her through the camera is also very helpful as this helps to ease her anxiety throughout the work day. The product is easy to set up taking minutes to install the comparable app and connect to WiFi. It works great no matter how far we are from our home as long as we have access to internet connection. The picture is clear and the rotating camera allows us to follow our doggo wherever she may roam. 5/5! I am definitely buying more to install throughout our home!",

It is super easy to set up and only took about 10 minutes. Picture/video quality is good, and I love that it has motion detection and the ability to speak through the camera via the microphone feature. The only negative aspect is that it needs to be plugged into an outlet to work, so that limits places it can be set up. It also lags slightly sometimes, but other than that, it is an amazing product for such a low price point! Would recommend.",

It records events, notifies you of movement/people, and can even track foreign movements on a patrol mode when you\u2019re not able to manually check the app. I haven\u2019t had any problems with the camera itself or the app, and both have been extremely reliable! I have gotten other cheaper cameras to use at home before, and none of them compare to this one. The picture, audio, and interface is near pristine and very straight forward to use. I recommend this to anyone, but especially to those who might typically have a little more trouble using technology like this. You can get your camera set up, and you\u2019re pretty much good to go from there on out!",

We recently took in a stray cat to rescue her from the cold weather and dangers that she would inherently meet outdoors. She is not yet tame and hides in the room we have provided for her. With this camera we can check in to monitor her movements with hope she will become less fearful and explore her environment. With its 360 degree rotation we get a great view of of her room.The accompanying app allows us to connect through Wi-Fi. As opposed to other more expensive cameras we have used, entering this app gives an almost immediate connection. The app also pings whenever it detects movement which gives up to the second notifications of her movements. We are currently using the provided slot to record captured videos onto a micro SD card. A card is not included, but can be easily purchased. If you prefer the camera does offer cloud storage with various purchase plans.We plan to use another camera in the same room to give an even more expansive view of her room. We are very happy with this purchase not only because of its quality, but because of its great price.",

                "reviewText": "I now have 3 WiFi security cameras, this, the Wyze V3, and a Vimtag, the latter two being 1k, in/out and without TPZ. I basically like this one and got it for the 2k and TPZ feature, and on the whole it's worked out well for me. I really like being able to move the lens around and zoom in when I notice something questionable outside.Since it's not rated for outdoor use I mounted it inside upside down near the top of a window, which has worked well other than not being able to use its nighttime IR due to window reflection. Perhaps because of that nighttime images are grainy and noisy, but still usable for security purposes. During the day images are fairly sharp and clean, but still not sharp enough to make out license plates.My only other complaint is that there's no PC app and you have to use their browser app, which is very basic and but gets the job done. For the $20 I paid for it I can't really complain though. I'll eventually get around to either buying a 4k camera or set up a Raspberry Pi for that since it has a 4k camera. Recommended.",

                "reviewText": "I had a few problems with the cameras going offline which I solved by improving the WiFi signal. The camera gives a reading of signal strength and I found you need at least 70% to keep the camera online. The camera is great looking up and ahead. If you want to look down I recommend you use the bracket provided and wall mount it. Overall a very good buy for the price.Bought these to keep an eye on our new cats, mum and kitten. They were found living wild under a patio in Gloucester and rescued by Cats Rescue. They are very timid but watching them settle in here has been a joy. These cameras have been a GREAT purchase and the night vision is AWESOME.",
