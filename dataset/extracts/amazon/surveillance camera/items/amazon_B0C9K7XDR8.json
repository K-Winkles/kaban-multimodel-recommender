                "reviewText": "I have 4 different models of Tapo cameras , and this outdoor model is now my favorite outdoor one . If you have an area that views your yard completely, I recommend this camera. My first impression agreed with the \" missing \" detections \" ,but then I got to thinking , it's for a reason! The 310WS has line crossing and vehicle detection. Now , you can't have this on a camera that moves 360 degrees and have it work correctly ! The line you set would move based on where the camera is aiming ! The camera would constantly be chasing cars in the background of a driveway ! ALSO , USE common sense , put a stationary camera on your driveway if you can see your neighbors house. I would not put this where I can snoop on my neighbor. I think that is ethically and morally wrong. I put mine in my front door , and yard. I left my fixed camera on the driveway , so as not to intrude on anywhere but my own yard . It's perfect for where I have it! I can scan my door for packages , talk to visitors , and check on my front yard from anywhere ! Great job Tapo ,for making another perfect security camera ! I may buy another for my backyard , so I can watch my deer when I am gone !Update : I did order another one , the option to pan and scan my yard is just to nice for me to not upgrade .",
