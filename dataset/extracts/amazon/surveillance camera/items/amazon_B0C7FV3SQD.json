When you plug the camera in, it literally talks you through what to do (or shows you on the app). Simple and easy. I didn't even crack open the instructions. No need to. I had all 4 up and running in no time, all while eating my dinner at the same time. The video quality is perfect and I love the fact the camera has the option to automatically track/follow the person/thing it \"sees.\" So cool. You can set the camera to ignore pets and only track humans, or even have it track a specially defined area you indicate. This camera has everything I needed and I am very happy that I purchased it. 100%.",

                "reviewTitle": "Yes, this camera IS 5Ghz compatible :-)",
                "reviewText": "Greatest camera ever, for the price. The design is amazing, it has great range for pan/tilt, and almost 360\u00b0 View. The setup can't be easier, it took me less than 5 minutes to have the camera on my 5Ghz WiFi and have the application installed on my iPhone.For those of you that are not super technical, look on YouTube and there's nice videos for the initial turn on. Don't be afraid, it's super easy. You can also use the app. There's a walk-thru with voice command to assist you. I tried the app on an iPhone 7+ and 13 Pro.This camera is a real 802.11ac, 5ghz frequency, compatible. I unplugged the camera multiple times and it reconnected to my WiFi network right away.Now let's talk about the application. So far it is FLAWLESS, either on my network and outside my network. I tried on the LTE network. I let my phone run the app for 10 hours in a row on my desk, while working. Not a glitch, no issue at all. It is intuitive and very easy to use. Everything you need is on the main page. The 2-way audio, the pan/tilt, the take-a-picture button and video recording. Yes you can record while watching on your phone.You can watch video while connected on the same network or while you're away. It worked great on LTE network. I tried UHD, HD and SD video quality mode. Personally, the best mode is HD. You can watch the video stream outside your WiFi network and have a constantly running transmission to your phone. There's nothing special to do, just fire up the application and enjoy.You can also watch video from your web browser. Just go on Arenti web site the get the url. I tried Firefox and Chrome, on a macOS, without any issue. Arenti suggest to use Chrome.The night mode is just amazing. It's like during the day except in black and white. I've never seen such a good quality when in the dark. When the camera is in night mode, you will see 4 red lights around it.You don't need an SD card to use the camera, unless you want to record events. I tried a 256Gb without a problem. Be aware that if the SD card is not FAT32, the camera will reformat it. Make sure you take a backup copy if it's a used one.The only drawback is the 2-way audio. From your phone the sound is crisp and clear. No issue at all. On the camera side, the sound is not that great. I suspect that the speaker and mic are to close on the camera, so there's a bit of feedback. That was the only negative aspect. I needed to find one :-)If I could, I would give 10 stars for this 50$ camera. I'm waiting for another deal on Amazon to buy more.",
