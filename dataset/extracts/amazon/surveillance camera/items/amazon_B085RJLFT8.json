                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great camera system if you want excellent customer support.",
                "reviewText": "This review applies to Firstrend Wireless NVR Kit Model # FTUS-W843M1TA-XM, which includes a wireless NVR unit, (4) 3MP wireless bullet cameras (resolution: 2288x1288), 5 power cables, a mini mouse, drill templates, a short ethernet cable and a user manual. This was my first purchase with a CCTV solution and it was an easy learning curve. Unboxing was straight forward, no issues there. The NVR itself is housed in a metal chassis with a 1 TB hard drive, the outer ports are (1) VGA, (1) HDMI port, (1) Ethernet port, (2) USB ports, (1) power port, and 2 wifi antennas. The unit does not come with an HDMI or VGA cable, so you must supply yourself if you want to setup the unit through the onboard setup. Once you connect the unit to power, and you can see a picture on the TV/monitor, the NVR will run through a setup wizard that is self explanatory. You cannot type in this interface, or hook up a keyboard, but the on screen menu will let you use a virtual keyboard where you can click the letters to setup a password for the system.The cameras come pre configured and paired from the factory. All you need to do is supply power. If for some reason your camera isn\u2019t paired, you can run through the menus and pair them by using the supplied ethernet cable. Each camera comes with an antenna, an adjustable ball socket that will clamp down, a mounting bracket with (3) screw holes, and a pair of wires that hold an ethernet jack and a power dongle. Placing them is relatively easy, and there are packs of drywall mounting screws if you need that.I tested this system for 30 days.What I liked:Easy setup: I was able to get it running in about 20 minutes, unboxing to NVR setup.Wireless connection is very strong. It runs the cameras on its own wireless network using an MKK protocol by default.Silent: the unit isn\u2019t noisy at all.Interface: the onboard interface can be clunky, but once you\u2019ve been in the menus, everything is just a right click away.Storage: the entire 30 days I was recording, I managed to fill up about 600GB of the 1 TB storage. This is 24/7 footage with motion alert clips.Backup: you can backup your clips to an external storage. My 5 TB drive wasn\u2019t recognized, but a 2TB drive worked just fine.Voice: each clip was also accompanied with audio.Playback: I could see all of my clips through the interface by using a quick search.Support: their technical support is top notch. They will usually respond to emails in a day or so, and their phone tech support is amazing.RTSP support: it is not explicitly mentioned anywhere, but after trying varying combinations of rtp:// urls I was able to get a feed from the different cameras to stream to YouTube or Twitch. For those interested it is rtsp://[username]:[password]@[ipaddress]:[port]/channel=[camera number]&stream=[0 or 1].sdp?Remote login: You can setup your router to port forward 3 different ports to login and view the clips or live feed.Phone app: XMEye Pro is what is recommended for this NVR. It connected flawlessly and I was able to manage the cameras and NVR easily.What I disliked:Power setup: each camera needs to be individually plugged in. Be prepared to use extension cords.Backup: to backup your clips, you must use the onboard software or the VMS software. You can only backup 1024 records or files at a time, and each backup of 1024 records takes on average about an hour. I had about 14,000 records. Customer service said they would fix this in a future update.Backup format: you can choose between three different formats to backup in: .h264, .avi, .mp4. The .h264 standard this NVR system uses is a proprietary version, so if you want to somehow view them on your computer, they won\u2019t play unless you use the included video codec executable the backup software writes to the backup directory. If you want avi and mp4 backups, be prepared for clips that are sped up too fast. I think it has something to do with the conversion trying to force a 30fps framerate on a 6-7 (average) fps clip. Also, sometimes the mp4/avi clips will drop entire chunks of video (20 seconds at a time).Windows software: You can also control this NVR through a windows application that is not included with the package nor available on their website. You need to contact customer service to get it. Once you have it, the interface is intuitive, and you can reach most settings for the NVR. The camera live feed is nice, but if you click on another tab of the program, it will sometimes bug out and not be able to load the feed. Restarting the software fixes this.Hard drive: As mentioned before, you need to use the software to get your clips. If you physically take the hard drive out to backup your clips, the drive is not recognized in any OS \u2013 Linux and Windows (didn\u2019t have a Mac). This is for security reasons I\u2019m sure, but it\u2019s annoying when I just want to copy the raw data.Wireless positioning: The wireless signal is strong, but you will need to find a place somewhere in the middle of your cameras if you want the sweet spot without having to piggyback one camera off another. The piggyback solution uses one of your cameras as a repeater of sorts to connect a far away camera to a camera that\u2019s closer to your NVR. I tried doing this to one of my cameras, and it fixed that cameras connection, but left the repeating camera\u2019s connection slower.Inconsistent clips: The cameras come with a resolution of 2288x1288 max, but sometimes they will record in 1280x720, 1920x1080 and the framerate will vary wildly from as low as 4 fps to 25fps. I know this cuts down on size, but it\u2019s annoying when I want to use the clip elsewhere.",

                "reviewText": "After a 4:am visit from LVMPD regarding suspicious activity on my street and neighborhood, I spent several hours researching security camera surveillance systems. After determining my needs and many other factors including NOT needing fancy bells and whistles. Just a solid, reliable, functional, simple and affordable security camera system and the fact that it came with a 2T hard drive didn't hurt my feelings. Most of the others were 1T for about the same price. It came down to three candidates. I'm so glad I chose the \"Firstrend 8CHL Wireless NVR System\". Mainly because the cameras are factory linked to the NVR before they're shipped. Truly is Plug & Play! You'll definitely need an HDMI Monitor or TV to get started. I just happened to have an old 2008 21\" 1080i TV that I could use as a monitor. (See Pics). I spread everything out in my home office, plugged everything in, followed a few simple instructions and BAM! there it was. 4 very clear images on the monitor! Couldn't have been happier! Now the real work begins. These are powered, hard wired cameras. 110vac power supply to each camera is needed. The cameras themselves were very simple to mount but It will take some thought, enginuity and a bit of craftyness if you are like me and didn't have a power supply anywhere near where I wanted to mount the cameras. As you can see by the pics, I managed to get power to all of them. Just took a couple days of climbing through the garage attic, pulling wire and mounting elec. boxes etc... but it was truly worth the work! Once everything was installed and powered up I turned on the monitor and BAM! once again the images just lit up. The daytime images are clear and crisp, the night images (although black and white) are also very clear as well. A little adjusting on the camera angles and my setup was perfect! Now it was time to download the software to my desktop. Windows 10, no problem. Mac desktop. still can't get the software to download, Stupid Apple thing I guess. Proprietorial POS won't accept dmg files without dropbox or something like that. I do have a call into tech and will let my wife handle that. It's her crApple. The apps on our phones were a snap and simple to use. My android and her iphone came right up no problemo! Still learning the ins and outs of setting up and using the many fine intricacies of the software. I decided to leave it hooked to its own monitor. Just simpler to manage the system from there rather than from downloaded software. I was lucky, I had a monitor to start with. You will need one too. Even if you use your big screen HDMI input. Or, Walmart has a great 22\" HDMI 1080P monitor for under $100. You won't be able to use your laptop to set up the system either. It's not a monitor. Now, to make a long story even longer, (but this is the sweet part and hence the Headline) System installed complete on sunday. The following tuesday early morning, there was a thief prowling the neighborhood and he was caught on our new system! Our next door neighbor is an LVMPD lieutenant and the punk was caught on our system getting into his car, then moving on to my house and checking the locked doors on my truck using a flashlight to look inside, then moved on across the street where he successfully got into my neighbors truck. Must have seen something he liked cause he jimmied the locked door and spent several minutes in there. then went on to two other neighbors homes checking gates and vehicles before moving out of sight. LVMPD came to our home at 7:30am this morning (yes, I'm writing this review just 12 hrs later) and asked if they could review our video from early this morning. Of course we let them in. The detective was able to pull up a fairly clear image of this punks face, downloaded 30 seconds of the video we had and took it with him. On his way out, he sincerely expressed his gratitude for people like us who take an interest in the security of our homes and neighborhoods. It made his job much more successful. He said with his equipment he would be able to clearly enhance the image and catch this Punk SOB. He would let us know when they do.Bottom Line: Money well spent on a great security camera system. Thank You Firstrend!Now if we could only get it to work on the Mac :) hmmmm",

It's all through email/Messages which works great when you work nights. I want to send out a Thank you to Yvette for assisting me. Looking forward to continuing to use this product that will add a few more cameras down the road. :)I did get help from Amazon to found out where and how to ask for assistance. So I want to make it simple too for others, Here is where you find the path to get the email/messaging started. You go to \"Sold by WiseArrive and Fulfilled by Amazon..\" section on the right hand side of the product, click on \"WiseArrive\" the company who's selling the wonderful product (which is below the buy now button). Once you get to the next page you will see info about the company and to the right you will see where it says \"Have A question for WiseArrive?\" you click on \"ask a question\" and it begins.:)",

We just purchased another system so we will run two different systems in the yard. We have experienced good quality and good value. Reliable systems.
