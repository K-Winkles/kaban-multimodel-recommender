                "reviewText": "Ok so this one was a bit of a mixed bag at first. Out of the box I had some annoyances. The advertised car and human detection was kind of there but in a very poor way. The alarms were annoying and simplistic. I could not get the high quality stream to work right. I was unable to pair it with my NVR. Just overall annoyed and thought it was all a marketing scam.Then I discovered that there is a firmware update. Oh my. Am I happy with these cameras now. The picture quality is excellent for the price point. The function set is second to none (at this price point). The app thing really works, its not just a badly made afterthought with bad English. The whole concept is good enough that you really could just buy this with no NVR, put in a decent size flash disk and you have your monitoring sorted. Its just awesome. I have a lot of cams. None of them come anywhere close to this brand. This is pure value for money. I am replacing all of my cams with this.",

I have a little trouble with the menu on my phone, for example the menu that is supposed to speed up playback does not respond. These are wired, so we had to cut a hole in the wall. I like being able to see the big display on my large monitor but also the convenience of seeing it on my phone downstairs. Picture quality is pretty good. I don't like the watermark logo they feel the need to put on, it makes it hard to see the upper left of the footage. No reason for that to be there.",
