For a stable connection, the distance between the camera and router should better be close. Q: Can I rotate the camera remotely with the app? A: P1 can control it to rotate left and right on the APP, and it needs to be rotated manually up and down. Q: Why the screen of the Security Camera is upside down? A: Maybe you flip the Security Camera up on the ceiling, please turn on \"Rotate Image\" in the \u2018Audio & Video\u2019 of the settings. Q: Why the Indoor Camera can't record video to my SD Card? A: Maybe your SD Card isn't identified by the Camera, please change your SD card to 8-64GB, and format it in FAT 32. Q: Does the camera support multiple accounts to view at the same time? A: Yes, you can invite your family members and friends to register an Osaio account, then enter their Osaio account\u2019s email address to share them with the camera. (You cannot log into the same account on different devices.)",

                "reviewText": "I was going on a short weekend trip with my family and wanted to be able to watch my pet while being away. I found this little camera on Amazon, at a great price and with good reviews. so, I went ahead and bought it.The camera comes with a set of instructions, and a USB power adapter with approximately 6' of USB cable. To quickly test the camera operation, you will first plug in the camera and download the Osaio app as instructed in the manual. The app will take you through a registration process, and it will give you step by step instructions to add the proper camera model (P1) and then connect to your Wi-Fi network. You use the app to operate the camera using Wi-Fi, move the lens to different angles, change the motion and night vision settings, listen to the surroundings and use the microphone on your device to speak. I would recommends moving as far as possible from the camera while doing the tests to avoid hearing noisy feedback from your device's mic when it is too close to the camera speaker. Once you are comfortable with the location and operation of the camera, you have to decide whether or not you want to record any video.The camera has several options to record video:- Using your mobile device's video recording: You have to manually activate the recording through the mobile device using the app; the video obtained from the camera will record to your mobile device. This is not the optimal option because it has to be activated manually, and it consumes significant storage space from your device.- Using a MicroSD card (not included): The camera has a MicroSD slot right below the lens. I would recommend placing a 64Gb or larger MicroSD storage card. With the MicroSD card inserted, you can record live video 24x7. When storage runs out, it will start overwriting on top of the oldest recordings on a continuous loop; no need to replace or add more storage.- Using Osaio's cloud storage - This is a paid option, and it offers some additional services to the customer depending on how much you pay.I purchased and added a MicroSD card to record video and audio. When I go out of town, I use my app with my mobile phone to watch my cat live and talk to him. I can also control the camera angle, zoom in and out and take quick snapshots or short videos from the app while I watch him. In addition, I can rewind to an earlier time to check on him at specific times, like when he's running to get his food at different times throughout the day. I can do this from anywhere at any time. Night vision works great as well. The camera detects light levels and sets the proper brightness automatically according to lighting.I highly recommend this camera. It has all the basic features you need to view and record; it is simple to set up and use and it is quite reliable. The capability of using it from anywhere (from home or any other city) using a mobile device is one of the most useful features in my opinion.",
