In motion detection mode, the camera will be in a standby state at ordinary times, and once motion is detected, it will automatically start recording video. This can save a lot of space on the SD card. This feature is useful to monitor the security of your home when you are traveling. In loop recording mode, the camera will keep recording video, and the newest video file will automatically overwrite the oldest video file.",

When no one is home during a trip, this feature allows you to see what's going on at home at any time. At work, the camera allows you to keep an eye on your babysitter's behavior and the condition of your children.",

                "reviewText": "The clock is compact, which is nice because it doesn\u2019t take up a lot of space. The design is very sleek as well. My husband didn\u2019t have a hard time setting it up. Although an SD card is necessary for recording (fyi). Very useful item to have, I would recommend for anyone needing a hidden camera.",

From a distance, there is absolutely no way anyone would be able to tell there is a tiny camera in the clock! Charged well and is super small so easy to travel with and use!",
