                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A nice upgrade to my 720p cameras",
                "reviewText": "I bought an 8 camera dvr that came with 4 cameras, intending to use some of my existing composite video cameras for the remaining 4 ports... Of course after a while with the 720 line cameras, I realized the old 480 line cameras were not very useful, so I have been aching for an upgrade. I looking at the options, and I saw this one was full HD, and it supported the three different standards for analog HD over coax, which is the common signal type for security DVR's. So this camera can use the same cabling as your older low resolution SD 480 line cameras, but it produces the full HD image for hd capable security DVRs. It has a pair of dip switches for selecting beteewn TVI, AHD, CVBS, and CVI. Keep in mind that these standards are analog, so the cable length and cable quality still have a big effect on the signal quality. The camera itself is digital, but the signals for the coax have to be analog for these standards.Comparing the 1080 camera to my existing 720 cameras, the differences are striking, as I have a much larger field of view with the new 1080 line camera. The older model C11N 720 line camers have a narrower field of view, so the ability to resolve details is about the same, but the 1080 has a much larger image. Both cameras have the same 3.6mm lens, but the camera chip on the new camera is larger, giving it a wider field of view from the same lens. So it is kind of hard to do too much of a side by side comparison, but the pixels seem to be about the same size, but now I can see the whole driveway with just one camera.I have some IP cameras I have been working with, and they perform very well, but you must run new cables, or depend on wifi for those to work. The big advantage of this model I am reviewing is I can just replace the existing cameras and not have to run new wires, and enjoy a big improvement, and they cost a lot less than IP cameras. I had a large number of IP cameras, and while I always like them in the begining, they ALL fail within 1 or 2 years, or they keep crashing. The standard cameras that run over coax tend to work forever, I have had zero failures with this camera type.The camera is of sturdy metal construction, just like my other Annke cameras. It comes with it's own swivel mount, with an allen wrench to tighten it once you have it in position. It also has a tripod thread mount you can use if you have an existing mount you want to reuse. The swivel comes right off using the included allen wrench. The metal case is well sealed, I've never had any of my Annke cameras leak or get internally fogged, like some of the cheaper cameras. So it should be very durable.The Annke night vision is superior to others I have used because the LED illuminators have their own glass. separated from the glass covering the lens. This is an important feature, because the other brands of night vision cameras I have tried have one glass covering the camera and LED's, which causes glare when in night mode. The other brands put a black ring behind the glass to block the glare, but the glass conducts the glare right past the ring. The Annke design cures this problem, and produces a clean and clear night vision performance.So once again, Annke has produced a nice, solid performing, affordable camera. It drops into an existing camera installation using the existing wire, and has modes to support the various standards for coax based security cameras, so it should work with most analog DVRs. Installing the cables can be the most expensive part of a security rollout, so it is nice that you can reused your existing infrastructure. Well done, Annke!",

                "reviewText": "This camera gives impressively good image clarity and night vision image brightness. Unfortunately, it causes incessant false-triggering of the DVR's motion detection while in night vision mode. I haven't been able to resolve this by any adjustment of the DVR's motion detection parameters (sensitivity, etc.). My guess is that the IR illumination is so intense that it causes an over-saturation of the image which in turn spoofs the DVR's motion-sensing algorithms. (It is especially frustrating that the DVR is the same brand as this camera, yet it causes motion-sensing issues while other brands of similar cameras used on the same DVR do not produce false triggers of the DVR's motion detection. Weird!) The other thing that I don't like about this camera's mount is - unfortunately - a common problem shared by many cameras: The mount's aiming adjustments are secured by set-screws, which often are difficult to access when the camera's housing is in the desired aiming position, making installation/adjustment more painful than it need be. Although this is a very common mounting/aiming \"mechanism\", it is much inferior to the universal ball-joint/locking ring \"mechanism\" that's available on some cameras - which does not have tiny set screws to be loosened/tightened individually (with the potential for them falling out and getting lost), and provides a quick and simple \"point-and-lock\" aiming adjustment - unlike this camera's mechanism that requires two separate axis adjustments plus a tilt adjustment - which are time-consuming, fiddly, and risk the loss of adjustment tools and/or set-screws. So, unfortunately, this otherwise very nice camera is hampered by an archaic aiming mechanism.",

I'll give it some time to see if it lasts or if it just burst into a bunch of smoke. The support page is very user unfriendly. It's absolutely worthless tells you absolutely nothing. We had to figure this out on our own poking and prodding, but it finally came to life. Like Frankenstein's monster. It lives! Hopefully it'll stay alive because when it's working again, it has a great picture. Time will tell. Again $20 and change, I can't expect perfection.",
