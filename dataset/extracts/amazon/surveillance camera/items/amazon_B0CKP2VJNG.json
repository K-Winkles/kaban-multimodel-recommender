                "reviewText": "remarrda 2K WiFi Camera, Night Vision, 6 IR LEDs Indoor Security Cameras for Elder/Baby/Dog/Pet, Camera with App 3-day Cloud Storage, 24/7 SD Card Storage, AI Motion Detection, 2-Way AudioThe security camera comes packaged in a retail-marked box with photos of the product and manufacturer's data on the sides. Inside the box, is the camera itself, a wall adapter, a long USB, A to USBC power cable, a mounting sticker, and screws with anchors , along with a quick start guide.Looking at the instructions, they note that you can set it on the shelf or mount it with the included 3M tape, as well as screwing it to the wall with the included screws and anchors.Looking at the camera itself, it's quite small , and the base is movable. In the base there is a metal panel which you can leave in to add weight to it to stand it up on a shelf, as it has four small rubber feet built into it. The metal plate on the bottom pops off, so you can use it to stick to the shelf or mounting area with the included 3M tape, or screw it down with the included anchors. The back of the camera has a speaker grill and the socket for the USBC power plug. The front of the camera has an indicator/status light with the lens mounted in the middle and a tiny hole for the microphone. As the camera is facing you, on the right-hand side, there is a slot for an SD card, if you would like to add memory capacity to your camera.Please note, the camera does not come with a memory card, but I suggest that you purchase one separately. That way the camera can \"remember\" a certain number of hours of videos security, depending on the size of your card.After you have completed the physical location for your camera, you'll need to install an app on your phone. The instructions give you a QR code to download the app but doesn't give you the name of the app for some reason. Scanning the QR code with my phone reveals that it is a web page at vicohome that forwards you automatically to the Google Play store for the \u2018VICO home security app\u2019. After downloading and installing the app to your phone, you'll have to complete registration in the app before using it.This part of the camera installation I do not agree with. They force you to register the camera as well as your name, and email address, which also reveals the camera serial number to the manufacturer. You can not use the camera without registration, period. With today's times of heightened security and proclivity of hackers, I don't like giving that much information to anyone, much less a manufacturer that has a possibility of being hacked.Once you have completed the registration with the app, you merely connect the camera to a power outlet and wait for the indicator light to quickly flash blue. This lets you know that the camera is ready to be paired with the app on your phone. Then you just merely click the add device in the app and find the camera to your network. The instructions then go on to give you any possible troubleshooting solutions for difficulties that you may have.",

                "reviewTitle": "It's a LOT of WIFI Cam for just \u00a312.99 - Utterly impressed and exceeded my expectations.",
                "reviewText": "Firstly to disclose I ordered this on vine, yet this review is impartial, I have no conflicts of interest I can think of. If I do not like something i'll give it a neutral or negative review. And i'll just say that writing a long, comprehensive review, having a high word/character count, adding the most photos or even demonstrating authenticity does not necessarily gain me anything. A review is a review.So I have no agenda, only that this might be to the benefit of prospective buyers and to give credit to the company/vendor where credit is due, unlike some viners who have written literally 7 words and no photos. That isn't even a review. I may also include some broader information on the product type compared to other similarly relevant Wifi cams that I've actually purchased. So long as it does not discredit the vendors product that i'm reviewing, or stray too far off topic. And that hopefully someone finds this useful in making a decision whether to buy the item in question versus any similar options that I won't disclose the names of.[START]So let's finally begin the information that pertains specifically to the product review, and not yet on my own unique yet perfectly legit setup and reasons for buying.The product came in White or Black, for covert use I needed black, otherwise I wouldn't mind either, the Box was well presented and a fantastic example of a \u00a312.99 Wifi Cam packaging, with its attributes and features on the sides. If I wasn't aware, this looks just a expensive as some \u00a325-\u00a330 examples i've tested but since returned. But.. upon opening the parts are not really separated or compartmentalised, it all sort of just fell out of the box on its own! Perhaps thats a thing, auto-unpacking. But for the cost this isn't enough to sway my opinion very much. The camera itself was in a soft opaque plastic bag which is pretty standard and the lense had a protective anti scratch cover with an indicator that you should unpeel it. If you suffer OCD, it might be possible to never unpeel it but don't quote me on that.[ACCESSORIES]The accessories included screws and permanent mounting kit. The second option if this were the be mounted at an angle, upside down or where gravity becomes an issue is a red self adhesive strip of tape.I do feel it would have been perfect and extra considerate to include two or three of these, but costs had to be cut somewhere. But some thick 3M VHB Acrylic foam tape (\u00a35) such 3M VHB RP45 GPH-110 1.1mm thick, cut to size would be quite a bit thicker and stronger than this red tape - But again the supplied tape is still perfectly adequate. But if you mess up a mounting attempt with the supplied tape, it's not the end of the world.Type C charging/Power cable & Plug. The cable is about 2M long, which again was a surprise as some, in fact many cheaper and more expensive cams only give you 1.5M, sometimes even less. And that additional 50CM gives you far more flexibility when it comes to mounting locations, and the ability to hide excess cable.As for the plug, it is white but that's fine, its light, retractable and about 20% smaller than your average USB plug. I tried to demonstrate this in my photos however they are differently shaped and it's not very apparent. But once again for this price we are lucky to get any detachable USB plug whatsoever, its preferable to a non detachable regular DC plug. So again, 2M length and the inclusion of a plug at all exceeds my expectations for the price.[SETUP]This has genuinely been the least complicated of the 3 I have actually purchased. I do not like instructions that you have to unfold like a map, but thats an obvious cost savings decision as opposed to a manual with pages. But It's also pretty typical for Wifi Cams under \u00a330.As you follow the setup the Camera speaks to you via its speakers in perfect English, and gives other sound indicators, in addition to the app making it very clear whats going on. It uses the same method as other Wifi cams by creating its own hot spot in which to gain network access, microphone, access to photos and other permissions.Once setup, you must register and it does not ask you for an excessive amount of information. Yes it offers a premium service with cloud storage but the good thing is, you are not really missing out by opting not to pay any additional fees. It does not spam or harass you to upgrade and if you already have a MicroSD card (\u00a310-\u00a315) for a 64-128GB Scandisk or a lesser brand is ok. Note that the cost of the average \u00a315 128GB microSD costs more than this entire \u00a312.99 Camera and all its features. Quite amazing really, and even the more expensive Wifi Cams rarely include a MicroSD card, mostly because they can make money by charging you for the subscription. But to anyone who doesn't really know what theyre just search Amazon for either 64GB or 128GB MicroSD card. I got one for \u00a310 and either of these sizes will be adequate for most users of this cam, whether its a baby, pet monitor, or a spy cam. As you may adjust the settings so it is not recording video non stop, even if it does you can set it to auto over-write.Once setup is complete and you've added your device you can then explore all of the options available that \u00a312.99 gets you. And I keep repeating myself but even the software and UI is really very good, I would expect less on more expensive 1080P Wifi Cams tbh.[CAMERA/IMAGE/VIDEO QUALITY]Again as a 2K Wifi Cam, I believe the images and screenshots that I've included speak for themselves. This is a good quality Camera for its size and price. Is it the best 2k Wifi Cam money can buy? Definitely not. But iits value for money on the other hand is very high simply due to the low price.And i'm not an expert in imaging, but as my photos demonstrate this very cost effective little cam is more than sufficient for nearly everyone. I recall when I owned the most expensive 4K Dashcam money could buy, two of them in fact at over \u00a3600, The Blackvue DR900S, one at the front of my Traffic Management Van, as that had its own rear DVR Cam setup and no rear windows. And the 2nd one in my 370Z Nismo just because. This was many years ago as 4k wasn't previously available. But the extra resolution and frame rate enabled me to use it as CCTV, capturing incidents and number plates of those illegally entering the site, whilst the car was potentially moving. So in that case, I tested during the day and it was so good as a \u00a3600+ camera that it could capture number plates in low light, or when it was day time and a i'd be on a 60mph road, with oncoming cars doing the same. Back then a 1080p NextBase Halfords special (as was standard) had no hope of doing that. In the same way, this 2k Cam will struggle in low light (yet not dark enough for night mode) and the image processing will not be as good as a \u00a350 or even \u00a3100 2k-4k Wifi Cam, it may also struggle to focus when challenged with forefront and background images. There is also a feature called \"magicpix\" which I cannot figure out what it is, its free but it seems to improve the video quality when enabled. And perhaps if I had read the manual i I would know. I did say this was no tutorial!But yet again, as a static camera that is tested before mounting, it is more than adequate at recording video and images in nearly all scenarios. But if you were installing a Wifi Cam in a commercial CCTV environment, you would be paying hundreds for each camera, and the size would be much larger. As smaller home Cams do sacrifice some image processing in keeping the unit small, designed for personal and home use. With some non-professional based espionage too, as this will also work well as a security cam. So long as you're not using it inside GCHQ, MI5, Area 51 etc I am quite certain this Wifi Cam meets and exceeds all expectations used in the home environment. At the end of the day, the cost of this product is such good value I am struggling to find any reasonable critical points that would be of any significance.[FEATURES & USER INTERFACE]AI motion detecting, human or pet detection are included in the free options. The 7 Day auto sleep/wake function in addition means you're not wasting power or Gigabytes if there are hours during the day when you do not need it online.You can watch it live, manually capture photos or record videos by clicking on their respective icons. Toggle the sound on/off, and the microphone. I will admit, the speakers are not very loud. But they are about as loud as my twice the cost Wifi Cam with 360 degrees swivel, tilting and despite being larger, It also was not very loud when attempting communication. I can hear the audio, but the speakers are simply not loud enough. If this were \u00a325, I might knock a star off for this. But it isn't.The user interface is very intuitive, you may add more devices if you like. I have no idea if this includes other ranges.You can do everything you might expect such as managing storage, reformatting. Adjusting the Cams own voice volume which unfortunately seems to be played via separate speakers as it is louder. Now I didn't buy this to communicate, and the audio capture is perfectly fine, so you're missing nothing there.[WINDOWS/DESKTOP APP]I did say this was not an exhaustive review, and I feel i've done my duty already. But I was curious if this was even possible and it is, using an android emulator app that might be in the guide i'm not sure. But there's no way a product this cheap can afford to create a second windows app. So they've simply guided you to download an android emulator, and from there you can download the VicoHome app and run it on windows, safely with no viruses etc.And my last 4 images (minus the manual) are screenshots from my laptop using the emulator. There's more than one emulator you could use, but if you are interested in this app on your computer then follow the link below, the instructions are quite clear you'll need a Google Play account, but its entirely free:https://www.gameloop.com/game/video-players-editors/vicohome-security-camera-app-on-pcAs with most cheaper WIFI Cams, this only connects to 2.4Ghz. That's not necessarily a cost saving measure as 2.4Ghz does travel further than 5Ghz. And my 5G ZTE MC801A is dual band anyway.Without going into too much more detail when it comes to \"Spy\" cams, generally the smaller you go, budget considering... unless your surname is Bond, you enjoy vodka martinis, and you have a colleague known as just \"Q\"...Designing and engineering small things costs more money, whilst the chances of any particular Cam in this up to \u00a330 sector possessing the typical features you might prefer, or absolutely need becomes less likely due to lack of space and additional cost as each part is more bespoke.And equally, i'm no Camera expert but should it meet certain criteria, the chances of extremely small Wifi Cams performing each of it's claimed features to a satisfactory standard also declines.In the last month i've tested two other similar Wifi cams and whilst I've reviewed this product on its own merits, my opinion is also somewhat influenced by similar but more expensive Wifi Cams that I have actually purchased on regular Amazon. As they were similar enough to be relevant yet more than double the price of this. One was \u00a325 and the other \u00a329.99, I cannot go too far off topic from this product that I ordered on vine, and both of the others had their own pros and cons which I am not here to advertise, if they're referenced it is only to give an informed opinion to anyone interested in this products comparative value, beyond the number of stars I've granted..And so, for \u00a312.99 listed at the time of review, I feel this is an absolute bargain for a 2K Wifi 2.4Ghz Cam with MicroSD card or cloud (subscription) options. I reused a pre-existing microSD card purchased separately, these aren't expensive and more expensive Wifi cams typically don't include them either. I have not yet been using this cam for very long, nor have I fully explored all features and scenarios, so this is not an exhaustive list of features or a tutorial. More of a first impressions overview, but I may return to add more to this after further long term use. But as per title, I was expecting far far less for the price and that is the primary message of this preliminary review.Whether you choose to buy this Wifi Cam over others, in the \u00a310 to \u00a330 range is going to depend on the intended uses and scenarios, which determine which features are more important over others. However if we were to consider Wifi cams in the \u00a310-\u00a315 range only then there is far less to talk about, and ones expectations should be far less, and more basic. But after two of my Amazon Parcels were stolen by a neighbour in my flat building, just minutes after Amazon delivered it on the ground floor in error..But after I calmed down and logic prevailed, I did not order this cam as a baby or pet monitor, I ordered it as an inconspicuous WifI Spy Cam, similar to the doorbell cams. And since Door Bell Cams became a thing, with my background in IT, repairing computers, owning what used to be the first 4k Blackvue dash cam @ \u00a3600, and innovating my own DVR systems for Traffic Management Vehicles. It used to make me laugh that the very first ones available were charging \u00a3150, as if this were some novel technology. When any IT geek knows thats a huge profit margin, much of it being Alexa licensing and software I suspect, as Wifi and Bluetooth 5.0+ antenna in modern laptops and phones are much, much smaller than people think. And Wifi Cams for far less already existed that could already achieve 95% of the features when Doorbell cams hit the market.But those who were unaware would readily pay these high amounts, not knowing that none of the parts or even the software justified the cost back then. And existing Wifi cams were cheaper, perhaps lacking the remote, alexa software and loud speakers/rechargeable Lithium Ion batteries only. And this Remarrda 2023 Upgraded 2K WiFi Camera is a perfect example of that, costing less than a Small Dominos pizza. Or 5x Lattes.But I digress, later after my Deliveries were stolen, Amazon customer service were brilliant, I was refunded. So I decided that retribution would be greater if I were to leave dummy packages in order to catch and record evidence of anymore theft with on Wifi Cam.So my primary use for this Cam was spying/espionage, and some grande innovation by simply connecting this product to a 30,000maH power bank, recording at 2k high definition with 128GB MicroSD card loop recording if full.Therefore if there were any further incidents the thieves would be caught. Knowing that they have stolen my items, and being that they have a spyhole/magic eye I suspect they'd not be brave enough to open the door. But I had plans if that were the case. If I ordered a Royal Mail Postman uniform.. well that was another idea that was put aside... I was absolutely angry and committed at the time but if they did indeed open the door then i'd politely show the video of him repeating the crime in high definition and then kindly ask that my items were returned, or I would have no choice but to <censored> with immediate effect, whilst reminding him that theft was a crime and in breach of his tenancy etc etc. So this cam when mounted on location, it was on the far right side to be secured within my metal post box, locked with a with key,. In fact using the red self adhesive it was in fact not noticeable in black, one would have to bend down onto the floor whilst looking directly at it.Should any thief double down and deny HD evidence of them picking up my dummy package, It would send them a letter stating that should my items not be returned/reimbursed: I would forward it to the Lease Management with the evidence and also to the police. He was renting, and I would not do anything to risk getting someone evicted, not over a couple of stolen parcels - I am not that unreasonable but repeated theft must be addressed.So if the scenario was not already cear, my plan when ordering was to use this as a hidden spy cam, connected to a 30,000 mah power bank ( literally inside my locked post box which is indoors and locked with my post box key. Using the sleep feature of this Wifi Cam within the app, you can tell it to sleep between for example 10PM to 8AM. As my Amazon almost always arrives after midday, usually after 4PM.You can set different sleep periods for each day of the week.And this feature plus motion detection (when awake) is highly important. As running a USB cable from the top/2nd floor to the ground would have not been impossible but highly unrealistic, and the cable would be noticed very quickly. Yet connecting to the 30,000 mAh power bank, with motion detection recording and sleep function set. Means this 5V Camera is going to use very little power, not recording non-stop which would drain the power bank unnecessarily as I only have a narrow window in which I need it to record. If you are using the supplied power cable and plug, many users may not want or need this feature.As does its technology within, almost always sacrifices quality to cope well with focus, HDR, low light and wireless signal strength. Unless you go very far over the \u00a310-\u00a330 budget, as my experienced proved, it has smaller microphones, smaller speakers for two way comms and also somewhere inside it needs to fit Wifi and maybe bluetooth Antenna as well as more bespoke circuitry.So although this unnamed Nano 4k Wifi cam may have been more desirable to others in different scenarios, for me the claimed 4K resolution was obviously inferior to that of this 2K Wifi Cam i'm reviewing. It struggled to cope with low light and it was returned as the cable broke within hours of testing.So to finally conclude, I feel this \"Remarrda 2023 Upgraded 2K WiFi Camera\" is of reasonable size, with a wide enough angle of view for my personal, unique circumstances. Is it the best 2K Wifi Cam on Amazon? Not even close, you could buy many for \u00a350-\u00a3100 that are fundamentally similar but ultimately better. But is it one of the best static 2k Cams for those on very low budget? Without question, Yes.",

Basic but it works ok.Night mode isn't that great and isn't to the best quality,The range of camera scope isn't very fair, compared to other cameras on the market.It is lightweight and looks nice and sturdy. Handy little camera for basic CCTV needs.Overall was ok, with sound and recording but just feel the money could go towards a Blink or Ezviz one.Ok if you are in a pinch.",
