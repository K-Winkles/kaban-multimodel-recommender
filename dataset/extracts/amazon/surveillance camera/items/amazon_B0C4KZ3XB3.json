The problem is the app, specifically the recording settings, and motion/person detection. I have tried every setting available on the app and still end up with 30-40 alerts a night with no movement in the video. I can't set it to record at specific times or turn the camera off with the app. I tried to reach out to customer support but received no response. I think the app needs to be more user friendly when it comes to the settings. Other than that it's okay.",

                "reviewText": "Was fairly easy to set up. Nice thing is it connects to 5GHz wifi network which is great! I also really liked the 64gb sd card that came as well, you plug that into the bottom of the camera which makes it a little more discreet. I opted to use that instead of paying for the cloud subscription. The SD card has been recording non stop for the past 13 days. Today is July 25th and I can go all the way back to the day I first set it up which was July 13th.when viewing playback, it will split everything into 5 minute intervals. So you will need to click like a 5 minute recording, and it starts playing but if you need to fast forward, you have to wait a little bit for it to load that far *then it will allow you to fast forward further. Take a look at my screenshot for how that's set up and visually looks.Camera quality is pretty nice and clear. I also attached a sccreenshot of how the night vision mode looks.Voice wise - I havent tested it much. Also haven't utilized the motion detection as well. the interface of the application is pretty simple to use.",
