                "reviewText": "Great value if I can get it working. Nice construction. Can't (yet) connect to it. I really hope they provide a little better documentation very soon. Here is an e-mail I wrote to their support:I recently purchase 2 of these cameras from Amazon for testing, with plans to purchase more depending on test results. However, I cannot seem to connect to the camera.The User Manual says the IP address should be 192.168.1.88, but it does not show up at this address. (even when I am on the same subnet)I also tried the IPCamSuite software, which I had a hard time finding a correct, working version. Using the software, for a brief instant, the camera showed up as a 10.???.???.??? address and then disappeared. I have not been able to find the camera again.Question: What is the best method to discover, and also change the IP address of these cameras?",

                "reviewText": "I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the video. For a camera on lower end of the price scale it has excellent quality. Had some minor issues getting it connected to a third party NVR but once I got into the camera's web interface I managed to get it connected. The interface is the only bad part. The translation wasn't great. It took some trial and error to get the settings correct. But once I figured it out and hung it up all seemed to be well. Clear picture day and night. This is its first day up so we will see how it holds up.",

Unusable without it.",

Its practical design and ideal size enhance its overall sophistication. However, it requires integration with a security system NVR/DVR through Ethernet for functionality, adding a layer of complexity to its usage. Despite this dependency, the product stands out for its stylish appearance and practical size, offering a sophisticated solution for surveillance needs.",
