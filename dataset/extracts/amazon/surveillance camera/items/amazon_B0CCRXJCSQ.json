I am 2 months past my return date so I guess I eat this one. Worked great, while it worked.I absolutely love this camera, and the app! I own a couple other types/brand so I have some experience. This camera installed easily to my 5G signal, works very well viewing and capturing events on my phone. I am not pressured to buy cloud services and probably won't. I am quite satisfied with all the settings and options, and functions in the app without cloud. I had only one suggestion to the developer which has to do with the warning voice, which by the way you can record your own voice. By default it plays 5 times (if turned on) and that's a bit much, once or twice; or owner's choice would be better. But that is soooo minor. This is a great camera, and great app. Best advice, which IS in the install instructions, is when you first power up everything, place the camera and your phone (on your wifi network) near the router and they connect easy peasy. Then just explore the app. You will be pleased.",

Also the QR code is a scam from Korea to make money. I was charged $4.99 when I just bought this home security camera that I thought was worth it. But I experienced false alarms, it started smoking and caught fire, I\u2019m very disappointed in this product. It\u2019s not about the amount it cost but the principle of selling such a bad product to US consumers. My driveway light post was severely damaged from the fire, luckily I did not install it in my house at my foyer of anywhere in the house for that matter. I\u2019m requesting for a refund and credit for the loss in my $5000 lamp post.",
