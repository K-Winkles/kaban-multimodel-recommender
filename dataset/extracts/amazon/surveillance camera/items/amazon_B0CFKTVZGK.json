Once connected to your LAN, you can login using the web interface, their pc app, or security camera software (in my case Blue Iris). It supports dual video streams and dual control protocols (RTSP and ONVIF). It has detection built-in with configuration by time range and region of the picture. It is really a 3.6M video stream at 20 fps. The housing is plastic and supports aiming but not PTZ. The web interface gives controls for ptz and playback from sd card but this camera does not support either. It boots quickly (about 45 seconds) and the IR image is reasonable but quite blurry with motion. Overall the video quality is just OK, not great. I gave it 4 stars because it supports standard protocols and was easy to connect to my NVR.",

                "reviewText": "This has one of the best web configuration menus I've seen, with a ton of settings and controls. Compared to other bare-bones or no-configuration cameras the plethora of fine tuning available for both main and sub streams was really outstanding. There's even an option to flip the video so if you mount this and realize the feed is upside down based on where you put it, the camera can adjust that for you. The only bad part of the web interface is that viewing the live feed on it is pretty broken by the web cache buffer of the browser, it is full of artifacts and extremely lagging. I opened the stream on RTSP with VLC and it is very clear and fast, just the web interface view doesn't work well, which can get a little frustrating while configuring it, but it works.PoE functionality was great, I had no issues powering this over the cable from my basic PoE network switch. I did have VLC drop the feed a lot when the camera was at full resolution, I had to lower it to 1080p to get the feed completely stable, and I think that was because my PoE switch is 100MB/s \"fast\" Ethernet, not Gigabit, and couldn't handle that much high bit rate from the 4Mp, at least on my setup.The camera image is good, even at 1080p, with only a little bit of warping around the edges most lenses give- better for distance views than up close. The night vision IR and LEDs worked great, another setting you can tweak from the handy web console.If I had to critique anything it would be that the base has no cutout in it for mounting the cable on the same surface as the camera- it fully expects you to go through the wall or ceiling this is mounted to. Some people might want to just screw this onto a surface and run the cable down the same surface- this does not allow that. It does however give you a really handy mounting guide paper you stick on the spot you chose, with the screw positions marked out for you to drill with no guesswork. That's very helpful!This works great over PoE power, has a very detailed web customization interface, streams well over RTSP (with some adjusting), and the picture and night vision are both very clear and capable. Installation is meant strictly for through-the-back of the wall/ceiling hole cabling, which limits it to only certain use cases, but within those situations it is a great choice, and I was quite pleased with it overall.",

I attempted to contact support, but the manufacturers support page wouldn\u2019t load. Save yourself the money and trouble and buy something else.Original ReviewThis camera works flawlessly with Blue Iris. The picture quality is more than excellent for the price and installation is just two screws and an ethernet cable. I use it outdoors in the weather without any issues and I highly recommend this camera. The audio it records is about average for a security camera that records audio.",

                "reviewText": "This camera works well out of the box, it does require you to supply your own accessories such as an NVR Kit with a POE switch port, storage, your own cabling, etc. The web interface advises it has a MicroSD recording option but it does not have any built in storage and I was not able to test that feature if it is indeed an option, I disassembled the camera a bit (see photos) and don't see a MicroSD port that is accessible without further disassembly.I tried this out using a Lorex NVR system where it was detected and worked fine and via it's native web interface. In all cases the max resolution is 2560x1440 which is ~3.6MP, so in some of the menu's the maximum it shows is 3MP mode, which is marketing equivalent to 4MP. It supports H.264 or H.265 compression and other modes allow for pretty decent NVR flexibility. Colors and resolution were vibrant and sharp during the day.At it's highest resolution the FPS is limited to 20 max. The camera does have motion detection capabilities which worked with my NVR but it does NOT offer Person/Vehicle detection intelligence. I would recommend systems with intelligence as it makes searching through archived footage much easier, since that is not part of this cameras features I do not consider it a fault, but for those looking at options something to consider.The physical body has a ring that you can twist off to obtain access a locking screw, from there you can loosen it and adjust the swivel/tilt of the camera. It was tight from the factory so you'll need to loosen it to make any initial adjustments. Another reminder is that you may wish to supply your own junction box if you are planning to surface mount, as the attached RJ45 receptical plug is pretty large and would require a wide diameter hole in the wall to bury it behind the camera.",
