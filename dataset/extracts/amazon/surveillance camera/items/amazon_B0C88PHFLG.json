                "reviewText": "I had purchased a blink doorbell camera because I can't see the driveway of my house and the front door isn't mine. I like to watch for deliveries so they don't bother the front tenant. I was very unhappy with that camera as without a subscription, Amazon has made it all but useless as it won't stay on live view for anything. I bought this camera for much less. The setup was very easy. It literally talks you through it. They're was no buffering like the blink camera had and it just works. The night vision makes it so you can view the camera at night easily and you can also view the camera from anywhere via the app. The picture quality is very good. It defaults to SD but you can change it to HD with the touch of a button. I wish it would stay on HD but if that's the only issue it's fine. This camera is well worth the money but remember it works on 2.4 Wi-Fi only so make sure your phone is connected to it before you start",

                "reviewText": "Of course, like most, I like that this indoor camera was listed for a great price (with the discount I ended up paying around $11,) but you get what you pay for. You either have to purchase an SD card, or pay $7/month for motion detected cloud storage of your footage. The app that you have to use to access the feed is decent, but working in the tech field, I don\u2019t know how much I would trust the cyber security of this app. With anything wired, the cord is of course annoying, and doesn\u2019t look very elegant. On a budget, I would recommend using it, but if you\u2019re looking for something more secure with better feed and features, I would pay the extra money for a better one. I\u2019ve attached one photos of the camera itself, with the cord attached, and a screen snip of the live footage so you can take a look at the video quality. All in all, it does what it\u2019s supposed to do, and advertised to do, but the quality of the product is what you\u2019d expect for $11.",
