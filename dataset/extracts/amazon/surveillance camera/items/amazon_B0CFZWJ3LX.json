This is my first ever camera so I just sat and went through the menus and hit every button to see what it did. I set my preferences and other options as there are as few or as many that you want depending on your preferences. For $42 I am impressed with this unit.

                "reviewText": "I bought this so I could see people approaching me door. The good is that the photo quality is pretty amazing. The wi-fi based interface, on your phone was fairly easy to navigate and set up. The \"motion detector\" option, however, isn't as reactive as I'd expect (it doesn't track well, or very quickly). I think as part of a larger system this would be an excellent component but for my purposes was not great.One big complaint is that that AC cord is only about 24\" long, meaning you either have put in an outlet up high or run it off an extension cord, which is sortof silly. All that said, it's not hugely expensive and does offer a GREAT image of whatever you are pointing it at.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Nice feature set. Weirdly short power cord.",
                "reviewText": "As a monitoring camera, this thing has a lot of great features. Two lenses - one wide angle and the other on a controllable rotating ball, awesome low light abilities, and the ability to store locally or in the cloud.What's weird though is that it has a y-split cable coming off it allowing you to connect it to a cat cable and/or a power cable that's about a foot long and then the power cable that has a boxed power supply in the middle is about another foot long.The wifi on it works great but unless you plan to use it through a powered cat connection instead, be prepared to break out the extension cords because you're not likely going to have a power plug anywhere near where you'll be putting this.That feels like a really odd choice to me.Anyway, setup was easy with the app. It requires you to set up an account but everything does these days. Once it's set up it gives you the option to store locally or in the cloud. To help push you towards a subscription service for the cloud, it gives you these two options and then will inform you there is no micro-SD card installed after you choose the local option. There is no local storage built in so be prepared with the SD card.It's not a huge deal, especially with such great features at this price point but the way it all happens with setup feels a little like a shakedown.Once up and running everything works great, though.I got this for monitoring my 3D printers remotely. The FDMs are all running octoprint and have cameras pointing at their print beds but the resin printers do not. The ability to see all of them in the wide view and the ability to look to each one of them and zoom with the dome is awesome.Also, unlike Octoprint which requires paid third party solutions to broadcast offsite and can take a while to load, this one works pretty reliably while offsite which is really great.Despite the shortcomings (one of them literal), it's really hard to grumble with how good this camera is at under $50.",
