Got on their Amazon sales site for easiest instructions & still not possible. I tried setting it up while standing on a ladder & using the light fixture it would be permanently placed in, no luck. Brought it back inside (had the have my paper with internet code & password outside on a windy day along with the pin they give you to reset) & took apart a lamp, connected the device & when I went to reset, the tiny pin couldn't find the dot inside to push. Guessing one of the 3 previous times I already reset it with the pin, broke the plastic, hidden reset spot inside. By the time I'm done with this it will have been over an hour of my time wasted unable to set this \"easy set up\" security 'bulb'. I couldn't get it to read the QR code the LAST TIME it shows one on my Apple phone. Yes. I know how far 15cm is. I teach science/math & the metrics system is superior to the mess we Americans have to use. It said it was 'simple' & if it had read the QR codes easily it probably would have been. I couldn't get the first QR code to read either but at least that one had a 2nd method on my phone screen to use whereas the last one that kept me on a ladder for 10 min. tilting & moving my phone at various distances & angles wouldn't. (There was one QR code that registered easily....) Very discouraging.",

                "reviewText": "The light bulb security camera is easy to install and easy to use. I bought this type of security camera because I didn't have to do anything more than screw in the device to the existing outdoor light. It is easy to connect to your wifi and start using the camera. I also like that it has a normal light built in. Using the app to use the camera is simple and has a clear view of the area it is covering. You can't beat the quality you get for the price you pay. I will be buying another for the back side of my home.",

It took me a couple of days before it was accepting of my phone number, they will NOT help you in any way. The camera itself has a pretty good picture quality, night vision is good. There's no way to zoom out, only in so on my front porch it will only get the top of peoples heads, not the face. But it will read my license plate in front of the house so that is one good thing.",

I really hope they consider what I have said about the bulb camera and changethe way the bulb camera works.Thank you for the refund. I will go from a terrible 1 star rating to a 2 star.I am specifically searching for a light bulb camera that works without a subscription. One thatI can put in my SD card and view and erase videos without taking the card in and out.These Don't Work Good Without A Subscription.It would not work correctly with an SD card. Kept trying to force a subscription. You can not control SD card, (remove videos) without taking it out of the device. I believe they all work this way so I am not trying anymore of these. I have tried 2. If that doesn't bother you, the picture was really good.",

Don't wait, get them now!!",
