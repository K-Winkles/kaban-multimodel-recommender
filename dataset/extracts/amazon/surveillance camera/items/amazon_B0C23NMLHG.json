The camera is inside behind the screen, and it still provides a clear picture, I can see the persons face and a clear picture of the dog. It has also been a deterrent, I\u2019ve had the camera for 4 days and so far, not poop has been left behind. It\u2019s worth the price.Easy set up. Less than 5 minutes.The settings are clear and can be easily adjusted on the app,I subscribed to the \u201ccloud\u201d, 8 day free trial. But the cloud isn\u2019t consistent with recording. So I ordered the SD Card. The SD card is best and easy to use. I personally recommend the SD memory card instead of the Cloud. My camera is set to record only when motion is detected. It works great, has not missed anything.Update. Months later , the camera is great. I certainly recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "I'll start off with this I bought the camera at an exceptionally reasonable price just as a hidden cam to catch people pillaging my tools when I'm not around. Using a adapter for a bulb to be able to plug in a DC jack I was able to remotely hide this camera from View and have it angled so I can detect any movement and individuals entering a certain area. It worked great, audio was clear as was the image. The app on the phone is easy to install and customize, and the windows pc app is awesome especially with my multi monitor desktop setup. You can record from your pc up to 30min, or from your phone but with less time. The alerts on movent are set to your desired sensitivity. Also as a plus its great to be away from home and still be able to check in at anytime. Sadly the cons. At times the mobile app has issues with connecting, my issue was due to having my vpn turned on so be aware issues like this can be due to your vpn. I'd like to do continuos recording only keeping essential recordings, but for that you need to sign up for YI's service plan, unlike a Lorex, NightOwl, or LTS home security bundle. Its the cost of convenience vs budget that conflicts. Monthly service was not something for me but might be for you. Overall im pleased with this camera and what it offers. Although I dont recommend it as a replacenent for home security setup. Its great for a baby monitor, a hidden cam, or whatever you might need thats quick and effective.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars WAS GREAT, BUT HAVING ISSUES",
                "reviewText": "Updated 9/2018:I have tried several other known name cameras and the quality of this is very good compared those out there and with a good app. I just ordered another camera and actually read the privacy policy which I recommend you do, unless you don\u2019t care about that stuff. Here\u2019s my take in the camera itself.SETUPVery easy and quick. Only connects to 2.4G wifi.CAMERA / AUDIOVideo resolution quality is very good. Probably one of the best if not the best i\u2019ve tested (Blink and Canary). If you\u2019re curious about doorbell cams, I currently have a Ring doorbell 2 installed and this video quality is noticeably better and clearer pointing out in the same area. Night vision works well and is clear which can be manually turned off if desired. Streaming is fluid and haven't experienced any buffering or freezing yet. Clear picture and good colors. Motion dection WORKS through dual pane glass window! It will record motion as it picks it up. For example, I have the detection set only on the floor section of the porch so it only detects motions as soon as someone walks onto my porch (not walk by). If someone delivers a package and puts it on my porch which will then activate mobile notifications, the camera playback will record BEFORE the person fully walks up to my porch (the detection zone). The motion notifications to my cell is fairly quick. The microphone picks up sound very well through dual a pane window and the speaker can be heard clearly from outside for example if you put this at your front door and want to communicate.APPNicely designed and user friendly with lots of features. Here are just some of those features: set a 4 digit passcode or Touch ID to view camera feed, ability to turn camera and mic on/off, flip the image 180 degrees, pan view for wider angles in portrait mode (uses motion of your phone similar to the 360 videos or swipe), record while viewing live!, take and save snap shots while viewing live!, two way talk. Customize motion detection area size and placement. I've experienced live view connects in 3 seconds or less.STORAGEIt has a micro SD memory card slot! Not available with Canary and Blink. With YI you get free 6 second motion clips with cloud storage and if you want to view full clips you will need to add a micro SD card. Clips are saved for at least 5 days (could be longer, I haven\u2019t really paid attention). YI also offers different storage plans so check those out if you plan on using that. I personally just use an SD card.BUILD QUALITYFirst packaging is quality (not that you care but is a nice touch). Build quality is excellent. I know it's a knock off of the Nest dropcam design but I don't care, it's $30! now (I paid $60 at the time) and it's excellent for the price. The camera itself is rotatable and removable from its stand which offers more custom mounting ideas with its design. The camera has to be plugged into power though. It comes with a decent length power cord but I think it should be longer. Wall mount is not included. Bottom of the stand has a rubber pad for sturdier stance.FINAL THOUGHTSI am impressed with this camera and what YI is offering their customers. They are definetly competing hard with the more expensive well known players like Nest, Blink, Canary, Samsung etc. If you\u2019re ok with the privacy policy then this a good camera.UPDATE 2/2019:A couple things we\u2019ve noticed is 1) the quickness to view the camera and 2) the apps recording alerts. What I mean by the first \u201cissue\u201d is when someone rings/knocks at the door, it takes a bit too long to open the app, load and view the person at the door. We have a pin/fingerprint lock set up on ours so that could be a factor. As for #2, what ever update Yi did to the app is frustrating. EVERYTIME we get a notification alert and go to the app to view it, it stays on loading and doesn\u2019t show the recording or the alert. Very annoying and makes it sort of pointless. I know it\u2019s not the app on my phone because my wife has the same problem on her phone. Hopefully they fix this issue real quick.",

The motion detection works on 6 second clips.I did have a lot of trouble signing up but after numerous attempts I finally created the account. You can see the attached as to the area I had trouble with.The video quality is pretty good. Sound recording which can be turned off picks up well.The motion detection seems pretty consistent as well. At least you can watch live feeds and the software is well written.For a basic camera it is worth trying, especially since the price is low for what you get.Updated As ofJan2023. Although I do not use this on a regular basis other than to monitor deliveries or visitors and for trips while away. It still works great. The new software update is nice and easy to use. Give them credit for keeping that up to date an access to settings well thought out. Also there is an app for PC and Phone. I bought another just as a back up or if I want to monitor more around the house.",
