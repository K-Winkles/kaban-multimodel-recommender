You have to purchase it separately or subscribe to kami via the app.App 2/5 stars- App is easy to setup and use but have several ads in them. It also sends notifications to subscribe to the monthly/annual cloud storage occasionally.Overall, I like the build quality of the cameras - yes they come in 2. If for personal use, you can also rely on the sd cards.For business purposes, I think 100/year on the cloud storage is not bad. Watch out for promotions too as they sometimes offer 30% off.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Works great",
                "reviewText": "I love almost everything about this camera. The night vision is clear, motion tracking works most of the time unless you're walking fast, then it just gives up like a cop in a Ford that just had a Lambo speed past. The picture quality is great & is only hindered by our slow & spotty country Internet. I bought this camera specifically for the time lapse feature which I think is cute as heck. I just wish it could do motion tracking at the same time, but you have to turn that feature off in order to do time lapse, which you also have to manually tell it to do unlike a more expensive competing camera that does it automatically every day. It also only does a 6 hour -> 30 second maximum time lapse unlike the other brand which does double. I did have an issue with downloading videos from the cloud. You can only download them in 10 minute or less segments & I kept getting the same video over & over & over again from 4 days earlier. The software is buggy. I wrote tech support but never heard back from anyone *update: I just got a reply from tech support. They didn't help with my Groundhog Day issue when downloading clips to my phone, but told me how to use the desktop software (which I already knew how to use). The software must have updated, because all of a sudden buttons on the desktop software works! Not all of them & not all the time, but most of them & most of the time. I was able to see my cloud videos, download to my PC, & even go fullscreen finally! The fullscreen option took about half a dozen clicks before it finally worked each time & the same with closing the software, but we're making progress! I'm so glad I can do this on my PC finally because I'm old & my phone screen is a pain in the butt to see. :) . Back to the downloading videos to the phone; I found a way around it, but it took a while. For anyone wanting to know why their videos are stuck in Groundhog day even though you've deleted all the downloaded videos & started over, it's because you have to delete each video while you're in the screen to be watching it, NOT in the screen that lists all the downloaded videos. It's the only way. Once you delete it from there, it will still be saved on your phone but within the software itself it will be gone & the next video you download will actually be the one you were intending to get. Also, the desktop software for the PC lets you view the live footage, but that's it. None of the other buttons work except for the one to purchase cloud storage. The X to close the program doesn't even work ... you have to right click on your bottom bar & close it from there. Again, great camera, REALLY buggy software. Finally, it does connect quickly & easily to your Amazon echo devices & you can view the live camera from there too with just a simple command. If they ever get their software debugged & working better, I would really like to buy another one that's capable of being mounted outside (this one isn't waterproof). I gave it 4 stars ... it lost 1 star for software that doesn't really work well yet (phone app & pc). If it weren't for the software that you kinda NEED to use the camera, the hardware alone would get 5 stars for being super fast & easy to set up right out of the box, great features, & picture quality.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE LATEST: THIS IS A CRAP CAMERA AND BAD COMPANY. It has potential, if YI did it right it would be fantastic. They put out app updates several times a month apparently to push their Cloud service instead of improving the app. The cameras firmware last update was 2019, so they obviously do not care about camera flaws. I have tried working with YI to no avail. NOT recommended CRAP CAMERA AND COMPANY.UPPDATE: Putting up with all the other flaws (see Previous below). Found a feature to use but that is flawed also. The feature is Auto Cruise which uses Bookmarks. This feature is useful but with a problem. After a time of use the camera view slowly vanishes to beyond the lip (like the privacy mode - lens goes hidden), this will happen in 6-10 hours. You then have to turn camera off/on to reset position. I have been working with YI but they are resisting a fix in app.The SD card seems to be disabled - forcing cloud usage. I don't want YI's cloud because I am rural and no real data. (Also don't like being manipulated to use cloud which YI/Kami seems to be forcing over time.)ORIGINAL: At one time I was impressed, but not so much anymore. The Sensitivity is useless now - it triggers on tiny spiders 20ft away on any setting. On Human a person has to be looming close in view to trigger - no good - not real AI, just blob mode. The SD card mode only shows 2 days (regardless of how large SD is) - I have a 32gb card that is full of what?, 2 days at 200mb? They use to record and let you see an optional 30 seconds off YOUR/my SD, but now only 6 seconds. The activity pic panel is decent but timeline is useless now. It acts like you get 2 days of cloud for free but no real evidence. I don't want cloud though - don't have the bandwidth or allotment. Don't know how to disable. Made the mistake of buying another YI (replacing a defective one - have 5 now) a few months ago thinking they would straighten things out - so far not! Summary: YI has gone seriously down hill. There are so many decent camera companies competing now to put up with this from YI.",
