I have a small iPhone, and the app is cut off/off center so I can't sign in from it. But it works great on my iPad. The images are quite good, and I was impressed with the night vision option. The motion detector picked up a mouse running across the pen, so it is quite good. Battery charge is okay, I will probably add a solar panel at some point. I am quite happy with it overall; it does the job.",

The quality is great, and the night view can be adjusted with a toggle on the spotlight or you can turn the spotlight off and just have infrared on. The microphone picks up sound several feet away. I definitely feel better about having this set up! Now just to test the weather proof claim with the frigid temps we\u2019re getting ready to get. I\u2019m definitely going to get another camera!Edit to add that the camera is still working in subzero temps! One of the best purchases I\u2019ve made.Edited to add again the camera stopped working but the email support team was quick to respond and have issued a new camera, that is back up and working again! Definitely will be getting another one for my front yard!",
