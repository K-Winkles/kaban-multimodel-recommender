                "reviewText": "This was an excellent camera. It was easy to set up and the associated app is user friendly also.I use it mainly to keep track of my dogs when they are in the garage. The video quality is clear as well as the audio compared to other cameras I have tried previously. I love the fact that it is motion enabled so it is able to track and follow my dogs around allowing peace of mind when I check on them.My favorite feature however is the sound detection, for example if my dogs are barking the camera will move and track to where they are even if they aren't moving.The only con is I wish this was also set up for outdoor use so I could place them outside my house.Highly recommend for fellow pet owners.",

                "reviewText": "The ease of set up is great. The way it sets up is secure. Unless someone is at the camera it can\u2019t be added to an account, due to the camera requiring a scan of a QR code. That\u2019s neat.I rate \u201cease of set up\u201d by whether or not reading the instructions is required. In this case, I didn\u2019t have to read them at all. Not everyone will be able to do that, but overall I found the setup to be very easy and quick.The quality of the picture and audio is second-to-none and matches or exceeds that of the \u201cbig brands\u201d.When using the PTZ feature, the quality of the picture didn\u2019t degrade or become choppy like it does on a lot of other systems. I\u2019m extremely impressed with the quality of the picture. That also depends on the quality of a person\u2019s network, but still. On my network, I\u2019ve had other systems that had quality issues but this camera has no issues at all.The audio: I absolutely love the quality of audio on this camera. It\u2019s not out of the ordinary to easily hear what a camera hears. Where this little camera shines is the speaker in the camera that transmits audio. It\u2019s awesome.The camera controls in the app are good and easy to understand. My one suggestion would be to make it easy to adjust the camera (PTZ) in micro increments. That wasn\u2019t easy for me to do. However, I was fairly quickly able to get the camera pointed where I wanted it.It\u2019s easy to invert the image in the camera so it (the camera) can be hung upside down and suspended from the ceiling.It comes with an easy-to-mount clip/base so you can attach the camera base to the wall, the ceiling or wherever. The clip securely mounts to the camera and isn\u2019t flimsy. It definitely holds it tightly.Connecting the camera to the wireless network was a breeze.The electric cord that comes with it is a great length, though I wish it was longer. That\u2019s an issue with where I put the camera, not with the camera itself, though.Over all, I love this little camera and absolutely recommend it. It\u2019s as good as any other camera and it\u2019s better than most.",

This was the winner, and I have no hesitation to recommend it to a friend. It is free, it definitely works, the video quality is quite good, and the app is pretty easy to use. Set up, took me a few times, but with reading reviews and following instructions again it was pretty simple to remedy. I like the video quality and how safe it makes us feel",
