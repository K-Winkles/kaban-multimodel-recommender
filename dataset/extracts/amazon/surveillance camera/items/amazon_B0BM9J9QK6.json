                "reviewText": "Most products from China that are sold through Amazon are really faulty. That's just my experience and so whenever I shop for something, I try to avoid that country as much as possible but sometimes, things fall through the cracks like this little bugger.You see a small camera, reasonably priced, seemingly easy set up = no brainer. Except it doesn't work. Here's what I have. Easy-enough to read English instructions with a small pictorial demonstration below, the QR code to dl the app, stand, cam and cord. All seems to be correct except, it doesn't work.So, I urge you to avoid this and spend the extra bucks on an actual camera.",
