But the app to control everything has to be the worst app I have ever interacted with. Not one thing about it is user friendly. And there are no explanations as to what any obscurely named setting might do. And those settings are spread out through 3to four different places across the app. If the camera wasn't way above my expectations I would give no stars.",
