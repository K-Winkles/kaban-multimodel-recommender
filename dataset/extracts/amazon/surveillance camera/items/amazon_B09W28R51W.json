                "reviewText": "This appears to be a great camera, as it's a small size, easy to place anywhere. The magnetic attachment is fairly strong (stronger than others I've had). The instructions aren't the best (incomplete at best), but after playing around with it for a bit, I was able to figure out how to get it to record. Didn't try night vision, but the motion detection alerts are nice (notifications can be turned off in app). The ability to turn off the flashing indicator light (in app), is a nice function as well.However, here's where the cons come into play: 1. Couldn't get it to record without using the FOWL app. 2. Unable to save/access videos on sd card. The videos show they're on the sd card in the app, but when inserting sd card into computer, it only has write protected files of the camera, no videos. 3. The FOWL app requires a username and password, but anybody with access to your phone can access the app without knowing either. Even if you log out of the app, when you go back into it, your username is auto-populated (fields will not remain blank). All anyone has to do is click 'log in' and they're in.I like the design/look of the camera, but I just can't get it to record video onto the sd card. Might be user error, defect etc, but this isn't going to work for me.",

It is just a little difficult to set up because it doesn't tell you anywhere that it takes a while to load. I had to start over several times because I didn't think it was working or I was doing something wrong. After I discovered it just took a while to load everything was fine. I even added another device to watch the camera and it was easy to load. I might be making another purchase for another area.",

                "reviewText": "Sadly, the battery lasted less than an hour before needing to be recharged. When it is at 30% battery life it would drop the wifi connection and stop showing a picture. Overall the picture wasn\u2019t bad even in the dark. I purchased this to put in a lizard cage to so I could watch without them seeing me, but unfortunately the view was narrower than I was needing. At 24\u201d above the floor of the enclosure I could only see about half of the 18\u201d x 18\u201d floor. Returned",

Poor image quality = constant movement of pixels so woth jight vision you often have to pause and zoom to discern if its movement of the image bouncing around.. The app is easily hacked apparently because every time there is evidence of trespassing, that footage is gone. Only that footage, and every time. Pointless waste of money. I would never buy this again",
