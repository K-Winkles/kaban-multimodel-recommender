This is not always the case at these price points.- Great HD video quality (turn on the Wide Dynamic Range (WDR) in the app)- Complete 360 rotation, AND great up and down tilt.- Appreciate the extra long USB-A to USB-C power cable.- The charging rectangle is the smallest I've seen that puts out 1A.- Night vision comes with IR lights (took a picture to see, they're only on when it's in night vision mode)- Motion tracking is super cool! And surprisingly accurate.Almost all of the interfacing with this camera will happen through the app. And it seems like it's a pretty standard smart device type app, like \"Smart Life\", which should be good for reliability. I actually tried the Smart Life app and it almost connected, but ultimately didn't work. Using their app was simple enough and I could do pretty much everything I wanted to do without reading any instructions. lol",

Installation was clear and it was running very quickly I like the image quality and even in low light the images are very impressive. I tested the motion tracking also and it seems to track very well.Overall the build quality and the packaging are very professional. The base weighs enough to not slip or move or get knocked over. I like the long cable and the connection. Very well done and the price paid is quite reasonable considering all that you are getting with this camera. I would recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this camera after reading many positive opinions and comparing different models. I was impressed by the quality and performance of this camera, The picture quality is in definitely high definition and a night vision mode is good too. The camera is easy to install and use on wall, ceilings, or flat surfaces. It comes with everything you need, including screws, dowels, a drilling template, a USB cable, and a power adapter. The camera works with the hugolog Cloud app, which is available for both Android and Apple. The app lets you control the camera settings, such as motion detection, alarm, resolution, and position. The camera supports a micro SD card up to 128 GB (which you need to buy separately or cloud storage. I had a memory card, so it didn't use the cloud option. The camera has a compact size and a beautiful design, and the packaging is simple and functional. The app has a detailed video with subtitles on how to install it, making installing straightforward. You just need 2.4G for Wifi (not 5G), which is not an issue. I am very satisfied with this purchase, and I recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good indoor surveillance camera at a reasonable price.",
