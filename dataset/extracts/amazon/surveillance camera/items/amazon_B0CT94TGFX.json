Not just an indoor cat anymore. With IP65 water resistance* you can automatically patrol your property in any weather. Automatic motion-tracking. Those cans never knew what hit them, but Pan v3 did. That's because it detects motion, follows, and records it automatically. Its upgraded tracking motor is quieter than a gossiping church mouse, so it won't wake napping babies or startle pets. See the whole room with 360\u00b0 pan and 180\u00b0 tilt. Now with double the tilt coverage, Pan v3 can look straight up and down. Just like my middle school gym teacher, but way less judgy. It was an awkward time for me, okay? Add a Wyze Outdoor Power Adapter v2 Ready for rain, snow, or shine. Pair your camera with an adapter made for the outdoors. The Wyze Outdoor Power Adapter v2 is designed to work with Wyze Cam Pan v3. Add to Cart Two-Way Audio. Data shows only 10% of users scroll this far down a page, and we assume even less actually read this text. You probably know what two-way audio is by now, but basically you can speak through the Wyze app, and that sound will come out of the camera. And you can listen as people talk to the camera, and that sound travels through a black hole that formed when Marty McFly kissed the high school version of his own mom, and then it comes out of your phone. Packed with app features. Set waypoints with Pan Scan Patrol your room with Pan Scan. Set the camera\u2019s patrol route with up to 4 custom waypoints. Motion and sound detection Wyze Cam Pan v3 sends your phone instant alerts when either motion or sound is detected. With Cam Plus, you can get advanced notifications, like if Wyze Cam hears a crying baby or a barking pet. Custom detection zones Set custom detection areas so you only receive motion notifications from areas of interest. Smoke and carbon monoxide alerts Receive an alert the moment Wyze Cam hears a Smoke or CO alarm go off, so even if you're not at home, you'll know if an alarm is sounding. Installs in 20 seconds. It's easy and intuitive to mount Wyze Cam Pan v3. Whether you're mounting upside down or right side up, the process is fast, easy, and painless.",
