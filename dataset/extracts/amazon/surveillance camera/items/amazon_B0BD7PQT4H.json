                "reviewText": "The instructions were basically nonsensical and poorly translated. The picture leaves a lot to be desired. It isn\u2019t what I would call a wide-angle of view, either. The camera setup is overly-complicated and the camera doesn\u2019t work with 5G. Only \u201c2 .4G\u201d (I\u2019m just assuming the period is meant to be a dash?). Charges quickly, I\u2019ll give it that. But you have to sign in to its custom Wi-Fi which is an unsecured network and continually gives errors that you need to connect it to a hotspot, when you cannot do both. It requires control of your phone\u2019s microphone 24/7 and wants access to your camera and gallery so that it may record and store photos and videos. You can choose to only allow access to certain photos and it will only access its own. I was able to get it up and running and even recording and taking pictures, even though it was always saying either that the camera was \u201cconnecting\u2026\u201d for quite some time, or that it failed. The motion detector doesn\u2019t work and the audio it records is from your phone, not from its own microphone, which makes zero sense to me. You have to be watching the live feed from your phone to see what\u2019s going on, there\u2019s nothing that alerts you to a motion on camera or takes photos or records videos automatically upon sensing motion. It lags considerably behind the live feed and freezes up quite a bit. It\u2019s not worth the threat to your privacy and personal data to allow all the permissions this app requires for the very little performance you get in return. And I prefer to be signed in to my own Wi-Fi and you can\u2019t do that and have the camera functioning at all. Well, you get what you pay for.",

                "reviewText": "Camera is extremely small I purchased 2 for the very 1st time, one works and the other one doesn't. You get what you pay for image wise. You download the app the link the camera to your wifi which allows you to hear and view recordings it also gives you the options to take a picture. I'm disappointed that both cameras are not working, I will be contacting the seller.Update DO NOT PURCHASE WASTE OF MONEY!!",

                "reviewText": "First, installation is a pain because the setup steps aren't clear. Then when you get it set up it's on like a 10x zoom and can't change it so the whole seeing a room isn't true. To see a whole room you need the room to be mansion sized. 3rd the camera consistently says session overloaded. There is no night vision at all to these camera. Disappointing I bought 4... huge waste of money.",
