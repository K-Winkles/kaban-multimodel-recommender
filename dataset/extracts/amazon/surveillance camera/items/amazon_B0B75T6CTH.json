But I am so glad I purchased one to try it out. I love the colored night vision! I mainly bought mine to be sure my wifi fan/lights are on/off when I click the buttons so when I get home my bedroom is cooler! I always thought Arlo was the way to go. However I\u2019m thinking on purchasing 6 more WYZE to replace my Arlo cameras throughout/around the house! Although per camera I think it\u2019s 2.99 for the security subscription per month but that still beats Arlo\u2019s subscription deals! Don\u2019t always think when it comes to price that your getting better equipment cause this right here shows you that for 20.00 per camera u get way better footage!",

They pick up motion of people and animals. I mounted one above my front door and it lets me know if someone is at the door. I check out who is there before opening the door so it is quite a safety feature. I can also tell when my mail has been put in my mailbox next to the door so I can retrieve it. You can't beat the price and quality. I have owned other brands in the past and WYZE out does them in all the things you would want in a Security Camera for an unbelievable price. You can't go wrong with any of the WYZE cameras and especially this model!",

                "reviewText": "I am really enjoying this camera, the WYZE Cam OG 1080p, as well as the 3x zoom model, the Wyze Cam OG Telephoto Indoor/Outdoor 1080p. The video quality is medium-high, and for what it is, I can not complain. It's a great little camera.I will complain about the app, because it's over 300 megs but very clunky to use and doesn't give you full access to the video files stored on the SD card. If you want to retrieve footage, you can do a playback and local-record (uses your device's screen capture video record feature) but this introduces latency and glitched audio. You also can't scrub forward and back very easily in the video, there are only back 30-seconds and forward 30-seconds buttons, or a timeline you have to pinch-zoom in order to scroll forward/back in time. It's not at all intuitive and difficult to use when trying to review and share footage with a police officer.The app really needs to give us access to the raw and unadulterated files without having to physically remove the SD card every time somebody gets arrested for shoplifting.So yeah, the app sucks. But they have a beta testing program and development forums, so there's some hope for the future.Technical notes: After using these cams for a month, I can tell you some statistics about video size and storage. Here is a table to help you decide which size SD card to buy. Video will overwrite itself once the card is filled, so how many days of video is that?512 GB card = 34 days of recording.256 GB card = 17 days.128 GB card = 8.5 days.64 GB card = 4.25 days.32 GB card = 2.125 days.I recommend a Samsung brand Micro SD card. Either a Samsung PRO Endurance or Samsung Pro Plus. The Endurance should last more years (decades if you get a 512 GB card), and the Pro Plus will let you copy off footage a bit faster (and should still last for decades).",

                "reviewText": "I'm a fan of these cameras since they are small and versatile. If you just want a few cameras for inside your house, this is a great option provided you have wifi coverage at every location. The cameras are somewhat easy to install.. I had a lot of problems with the first two when it came to making a bluetooth connection.The update process (firmware) is straightforward and once you have the cameras set up with wifi and your account they work pretty well. Night vision is fine and the resolution of the camera is good for the price. I've only used the voice/sound feature as a joke a couple of times, but it worked well enough.What I dislike is the app. I give it 10% odds of crashing any time I open an alert. It'll just back out of the current screen, or the whole app will go black. Not a fan at all, albeit it is convenient to be able to view the cameras through your phone.The tilt on this unit is also a little finicky. I find that I can pan it easily, but tilting it up or down is somewhat sticky. That's a minor quibble compared to the value of the camera. Shame that the app is so wonky.",

Exceptionally good product for the price.I also have a more expensive model from Wyze installed close to this one but during the cold snap, stopped working. I had to bring it in to warm it up even though it was rated for the outdoors.",
