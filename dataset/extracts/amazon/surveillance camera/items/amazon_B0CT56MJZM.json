                "reviewText": "The dual-band WiFi connectivity, which operates at 2.4 and 5 GHz, guarantees a steady and dependable connection, which enables me to view live video and warnings without any difficulty using the accompanying mobile application. The process of setting up the camera was simple, and the fact that it is compatible with both cloud storage and SD card storage choices provides a degree of flexibility in terms of data storage requirements. The auto-tracking capability of this dome camera is, in my opinion, a vital component of the camera. As it intelligently tracks movement, it is able to capture every detail and provide a full image of the surrounding environment. During the process of monitoring outside areas, this proved to be quite useful since the camera was able to follow any movement that occurred within its range of vision. Another feature that stands out is the camera's exceptional waterproof certification of IP66, which guarantees that it will function faultlessly in a wide range of weather situations. Because of the two-way audio feature, I have a heightened feeling of trust and confidence. My ability to converse with guests or discourage prospective attackers from a distance is made possible by the microphone and speaker that are embedded into the device. Having access to this interactive function provides an additional degree of confidence, particularly while I am away from home. The quality of the audio transmission is remarkable, and the ability to communicate in real time is an extraordinary advantage that contributes significantly to the upkeep of a safe environment.",

These cameras have a few features that I adore. The tracking feature is the most important. If a person is detected, it will move and keep that person in frame. The spotlight is up next. It is very visible and alerts people that they are being recorded. It's also convenient because when I walk outside, the light turns on and follows me, providing a well-lit path.
