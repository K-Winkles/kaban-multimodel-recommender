If your Micro SD is full, it will overwrite the previous content, and you can still use it continuously.Q: Does the security camera detect any movement and will alert you? Will there be a delay in motion detection?A: No, our DEKCO security camera can set the sensitivity of the monitoring point. For wind, grass and other sports, it may not send you an alert. There will be no delay in our motion detection, and an alert will be sent to you immediately.",

                "reviewText": "I ourchased the two pack as I had to monitor my seasonal camp because of a contractor that likes to steal supplies. This was easy to set up, does not use a huge amount of bandwidth, the 360 degree option and night vision is great. Love the ability to see and hear whats going on. Plus NO Subscriptions! I installed two 128 micro disks on both which is pefect. Motion activated and crystal clear. You will not be sorry you bought thse! Install the app on your phone or iPad and you have 24/7 monitoring. Only negative is that you can not see both cams on the same page, you have to switch between the two. Its a great buy!!",

                "reviewText": "I've had these cameras for over a year and they're the most unreliable cameras I've ever owned...First - The listing lies to you - these ONLY work on 2.4ghz.. AI Human Auto Tracking? Yeah sure, LOLThe biggest issue is connectivity. I even bought a wifi extender and have it 10ft from the cameras and they STILL hardly ever connect when using the app.Did someone ring your doorbell? Did you hear a loud crash outside? A gunshot? Need to check the camera quickly to see what's going on outside? Good luck! You MIGHT be able to get live view going after a few minutes of trying to re-connect but by that time whatever's going on outside has probably passed. Need to check prior recordings? Get ready for some serious frustration that in most cases leads to not being able to view a SINGLE recording on the app because they will all just spin out and not connect.I'm an IT person and am no stranger to Wifi cameras. I've tried troubleshooting these, reset them, moved antennas around, reconnected to wifi, purchased an additional wifi extender, etc. These cameras are just awful (or it's just the app, but since it's required, it in return makes the cameras garbage too!).Sorry if this review seems like a rant, because it is! I'm finally frustrated enough with these unreliable cameras to just let it out! Esp when I see these have such high reviews - there's just no way! These cameras are not a good buy!",

                "reviewText": "Bought 4 of them nearly two years ago. They are still running strong. I dislike that if you change the password for your home internet you would have to take down all the cameras and reset and reconnect back. The cameras are extremely difficult to watch live and recorded streams on the app even though I have 200Mb broadband speed. Many times the display would keep spinning around trying to connect to the server until it gives up. The image quality is okay. Installation is not that hard. Just bring all cameras near your router and connect to your internet using the app on your phone. Then take them and install around your residence. The value for money is good. The cameras look well made and durable. The customer service is very good. If it could only connect to the app quickly as other manufacturer's cameras that I have it would have been so good. Now concerning night vision all my cameras, from three different companies, are more or less the same- if the subject comes 15-20 feet it would be probably be possible to make an identification but further and the subject gets a little difficult to make out. Day time pics are good. I don't think I would buy again just because of the difficulty in connecting to their server to see the live and recorded streams on their app. Really that app needs to be reworked on and updated.",

As for the clarity of the videos, the night vision is nearly as sharp as the daytime videos. I did contact customer support for one issue but that was on me. I just didn't understand how to download a clip so I could email it. I found customer support to be very good and returned my call to them in a timely manner.",

The only thing I don't like is that my old ones use a different app than the new ones. This isn't a problem, it just would have been nice to be able to use one app for all cameras. I'm super happy with these cameras. I highly recommend them. The price is good and the quality is great for my needs.",

It works great otherwise and as I said, the app is simple and works well. I've had no issues with functionality I just wish there was something to be done about the cameras focusing on useless things like water particles!",

                "reviewText": "This is an excellent camera, from a fantastic company. I purchased this camera while it was on sale, and after some underwhelming experiences with other cameras around this price-point, I wasn't sure if this one would be good. But it is an excellent camera, with great picture quality! The 2k resolution provides a nice improvement over a 1080p camera.Good things about the camera:- Good night vision/IR- Pan function- Intercom (microphone and speaker) function through the app- CloudEdge app works well- MicroSD card slot for recording, not forced to pay for a cloud service.- DC Barrel power plug (more durable than USB, and easier to extend over long distances)One of the best features is that this camera supports ONVIF/RTSP. You just have to enable it using the app, and then you can connect the camera to a standard NVR or other software that supports ONVIF. I'm using it with Synology Surveillance Station and it's working great.When I first bought the camera, the panning control didn't work from Surveillance Station/using ONVIF. I emailed Dekco and they replied to me and had a firmware update ready in less than 24 hours! After installing the firmware update with the app and reconnecting the camera, the panning control worked. Their customer support is AMAZING!Since purchasing this camera, I've bought 3 more Dekco cameras (a 2K Pan/Tilt DC5E, and two 5MP Pan/Tilt DC5P). I've been equally (or more) impressed with these other cameras and can definitely recommend any of these models (DC4L, DC5E, DC5P) or likely any other camera from Dekco.If you can afford the extra money, I would suggest either pan/tilt models (DC5P/DC5E) - it's a little more versatile having the ability to pan left/right and tilt up/down, instead of just panning. But you can't go wrong with the DC4L if you don't need the tilt feature.",
