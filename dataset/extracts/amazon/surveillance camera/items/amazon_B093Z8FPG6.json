                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying I was on the fence for months as to whether I should actually buy this Garage Door opener from MyQ. The reviews on Amazon were very mixed and I wasn't too pleased that once I bought into this product, I would probably have to spend more. I will talk about that in a moment.I actually decided to make a purchase during Prime Day when the cost of this item sold for about $20 less than it regularly does. It seemed like an absolute bargain at that point.The installation was very simple. The mounting was a bit of a nightmare only because MyQ didn't fully explain that process in their directions.The installation process is a breeze, thanks to the mobile app which does an excellent job of walking you through the process, complete with videos that make a novice like me an expert. You basically use the app to pair the base unit and the sensor. The sensor comes with two-sided tape and gets placed on the inside of your garage door.The problem I ran into was the screws. MyQ provides you with 2 different sized sets of screws. They don't tell you that if you use the anchors, you must use the shorter screws. I used the longer ones. Now, I am sure most of you who are more handymen than I am probably could have figured that out on your own, but for someone not as mechanically inclined, it would have been nice for MyQ to give a better explanation of screw usage in their instruction manual. Once I undid the initial mistake, I was able to successfully mount the MyQ to my garage ceiling beam.One other note to make here: The mounting bracket is also a bit of a problem. You have to go through two sets of holes to drill in your screw. It's a little cumbersome. I wish the bracket was designed a little better to make it easier. I am guessing this was the best MyQ could do. All in all, I am not taking any stars away in this review for the clunky install and bracket. I am guessing most of you who are more handymen orientated won't have an issue.So, once installed, the garage opened and closed as expected using the remote. No issues there.The real nice surprise here was that, for the moment, MyQ is no longer charging people $10 a year to integrate MyQ with Google (and I think) Alexa. Previously, there was a subscription charge. That caused a huge amount of backlash from customers. I even swore I would not buy this product if a subscription was mandated. Well, for now, that subscription has been put on hold. You can get free integration for your smart device. Be aware that for the moment MyQ is saying this could be only temporary.Voice integration with Google Home Hub is not as fluent as you would hope. You can't just say, \"Hey Google, is my Garage Door open?\" of \"Hey Google, close my garage door.\" You have to say, \"Hey Google, ask MyQ if my Garage Door is Open.\" I am not exactly happy about that extra step.Also, do realize that there are extra security measures put in place that prevent homeowners from giving smart devices opening commands. You can't say, \"Hey Google (or Alexa) open my Garage Door.\" The reason behind this is so burglars can't yell that command from outside your home in hopes of your smart device picking it up.HOWEVER....HOWEVER...HOWEVER...There is a new, free software workaround that allows you to open and close your garage door through Alexa (and probably Google) commands. You don't need to buy the $15 kit. If you want more information you can reply to me in the comments.One other thing I need to mention here. If you want iOS/Homekit support you need to buy the additional $90 MyQ bridge. I found that aspect to be unfortunate as that add-on is severely overpriced. I will end up purchasing it just so that I can open and close my garage door using the new iOS 13 Carplay functionality which puts Homekit on your navigation screen. It would be great, as I arrive home to say, \"Hey Siri, open my garage door.\"So, bottom line: The MyQ garage door opener works great out of the box. Some of its smart home command functionality is limited, but there are workarounds.",

                "reviewText": "Good instructions along with watching a You Tube video of the installation process made the work go quickly. I was initially having a wi-fi problem getting the equipment to link up with the MyQ app. so decided to bring the hub into the computer room, plug it in, and finish up the linking with my phone app and then took the hub and sensor to the garage for the installation and all went very well. It became almost as simple as plug & play. Works great. I installed this Smart Garage Control along with a new Liftmaster wall unit for openers with the older purple learning button. Enjoy having the automatic timer to shut the garage door and also having e-mail alerts every time the garage door opens or closes, courtesy of this Smart Control. The door sensor is battery powered and we get an alert when the battery is low, so another nice feature. The inexpensive quarter-size 3 volt battery (CR2450) should last a year or more and takes all of about two minutes to replace. Never thought I could get a 2009 model Liftmaster with a purple learning button to have all of the features of the newest wi-fi model Liftmaster. I do have a newer Liftmaster opener near this 2009 model and both now work identically. Great value for what is offered. Much less expensive and a lot less work than purchasing a new door opener with the MyQ features.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this product about 9 months ago. I have an older Chamberlain garage door, this was the perfect pairing. I can open my Garage Door from my phone. I can add multiple users, so I can see who opened the door and if they closed it. I can set times to access for my cleaning service. I was very happy.Today, I am even happier. After owning the product for a while, it just stopped working. I attempted to reinstall, reset and the like, nothing worked. I called their support line, I was disappointed when I realized I was connect with an off shore support department. I have not had good luck of late with support basede off shore.My technician Roger was incredibly knowledgable, polite and patient. He walked me through multiple iterations to troubleshoot my issue. Roger advised that I had the hub mounted too close to the garage door opener and suggested I go across to another outlet to attempt connecting the sensor to the lifting unit. It worked right away! Roger said that sometimes large metal objects can interfere and that moving the hub usually fixes it.This isn't someone reading from a script, this is a true professional, an experienced professional available at 10 AM on a Saturday to help you with a product.Kudos to MyQ and Chamberlain, you have a great product and equally great support. Mark me a happy customer.Buy this!",

The in-app instructions were easy to follow.We also linked it to our Tesla, which has been incredibly convenient - MyQ is directly built into the Tesla software. We have set it to automatically open and close when we arrive or leave home.The only issue we\u2019ve had so far is the controller disconnecting from wifi, but that is to be expected with any IoT device. It has always automatically reconnected.Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "Very easy to install. Pairing with a compatible opener was very fast and simple. Response time from pressing the open and close buttons in the MyQ or other compatible app is immediate -- which is great since I've read other similar units have a significant delay. My only relatively minor complains are that a) the unit can only be paired with one application, so for example we can't pair it with both they MyQ app and our Smarthome/security system app -- only one or the other, and b) if trying to send a close or open commands to two doors at the same time it does not work. There has to be at least a few seconds of delay between the two commands. But these are manageable problems.Note that it does *not* support z-wave, so if your home uses z-wave extensively you may wish to consider another unit. The unit connects via Wifi so you must have good Wifi coverage in your garage.",
