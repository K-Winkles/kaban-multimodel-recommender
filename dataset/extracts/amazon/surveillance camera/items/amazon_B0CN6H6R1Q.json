                "reviewText": "It was difficult to setup this camera at first, as it has issues with wifi, probably the wifi chip that's in here isn't that great. After a few tries, it worked and got it connected to the app. Also, the app requires privacy permissions so if you are comfortable with that, it's the only way to get this camera connected to your phone. The built in small battery in here is useless it would die around 5-10 minutes or so. Better off with a powerbank.Video quality-wise, it's an upscaled 1080p. I wont even consider this as 720p HD, quality is terrible, dark and like an old school 90s webcam. I guess this camera would only be suited for maybe when it's pointed outside where it's bright and sunny. It's not a reliable surveillance amd securty camera.",
