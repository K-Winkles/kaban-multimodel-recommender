You can tap to change by degree (adjustable) or hold to pan until you remover your finger. SD card slot is built in to the bottom for capturing video without a subscription service. HD camera shows pictures crisp and clean and night vision is perfect as well (greyscale but crisp). There is a green power LED that you can leave on,or turn off if you want secret mode. The camera swivels noislessly. Comes with a mounting bracket to fasten to a wall or ceiling. This does require a wall plug in so keep that in mind.",

This camera automatically tracks motion although my pupper does run around quite a bit so sometimes the camera does not keep up and I have to manually pan. The camera also switches on its own to night vision if it is too dark in the environment. Another excellent feature is the \"call\" button which I can use to talk through. The picture is great and the sound quality is enough to know what is going on in the environment. Save some money and choose this camera, it gets the job done!",

                "reviewText": "Do you need a camera to monitor part of the house, the garage, the pets? Do you have a plug nearby? Then this camera is great. It's not the highest res, but 1080P is very clear and does a good job with night vision even though there are not a lot of IR lights around it. It has a decent amount of rotation and tilt to be able to monitor a pretty wide area.Setup, was a little quirky. you first connect your phone to the cameras wifi. Then you set the camera to detect the home wifi router, putting in the 2.4ghz password. If that completes, you're pretty much on your way. If not, you have to repeat this step a couple of times, which happened to me. At first i wasn't too sure of the setup routine as it wouldn't complete the setup. Another irritation is, it will say your microsd car isn't useable. You need to use the tapo app to format the sd card once the phone app and camera are setup, and it should be fine. The phone app lets you take a picture, lets you record and stop recording. What i dont know yet, is it recording per schedule, or recording when you hit the record button while viewing? I will have to check into that, but you get a scheduler like most security cams, with normal recording schedule and motion schedule. It comes with a mount bracket to mount on wall or someplace. I just have it on a desk so i can point it down at where my dog sleeps. You can pan it around and the 1080p picture is clear in daylight and infrared at night. If the setup worked a little better i'd give this 5 stars because the price is great.So if you need a small camera, that you can just place somewhere in the house in range of your 2.4ghz router, this works and was somewhat easy to set up. 4stars for now, but 5 star price.i'm updating review since i just bought my 3rd tapo camera. So connection setup must have been fixed somewhat as i was able to set up on first try. It's still the same though as i mentioned above. What i didn't mention, is that there is a normal recording schedule which records continuously and a motion recoring schedule which only records when it detects movement. So when you go to play back you will only see snippets of recording if you only selected motion. They added a lot of features which requires some sort of subscription, like i do not use cloud, i dont like my home being stored online. I dont use advanced (subscribed) features like they can send you emails with snapshot for different triggers (movement, person, baby) but you will pay for this email service. It does have notifications though for free and it is just a text msg saying a detection happened, which is good enough for me. Also with other cameras you can filter sections of the screen out, that it wont trigger a notification. This works well unless you follow mode which the camera will try to follow the movement and then the filtered section will now filter areas you didn't want to. So take that into consideration. Still giving this a 5 for the price of the camera.",

                "reviewText": "We purchased the KASA models for our home in Florida, but KASA cameras are expensive on Amazon here in Canada. So we went with this model, based on the price we paid in the US for KASA. The camera came on time and as advertised.Thes TAPO cameras are obviously made by the same company as KASA, they look exactly the same the only difference is that you need to download the TAPO app. The camera is easy to install, and once the app is loaded onto your phone, it takes a couple of minutes to connect. The picture quality is great, it works EXACTLY like the KASA, and interestingly enough, when I opened the TAPO app, my Kasa cameras in Florida appeared there, there's obviously an intuitive feature built into the app! I dont even need to go to my KASA app. to view my cameras in my Florida home, there. This TAPO camera is very good with a high quality picture, the only issue is that on the app, there is no opportunity for shutting down SPECIFIC notifications, such as people movement, noise, etc. so unless you go into the settings on your phone to shut down ALL notifications, you will get one movement notification after another on your phone. KASA is much easier to use in that it has settings to shut down specific notifications. However, I would recommend the TAPO camera, the price is good and it works well. Just needs app improvements, I think. Woud I order again? Probably.",

La calidad de video es excelente incluso a 720p, el modo nocturno es muy claro y en total oscuridad pareciera que hay alg\u00fan foco prendido. El seguimiento de movimiento tambi\u00e9n es muy preciso aunque eso si, cuando sigue a una persona y en el movimiento la c\u00e1mara se topa con algun arbol con las hojas moviendose, se puede quedar ah\u00ed pegada hasta que las hojas dejen de moverse y entonces volver\u00e1 a su posici\u00f3n inicial, por eso prefer\u00ed desactivar el seguimiento de personas.En cuanto al altavoz y microfono son buenos para escuchar y hablar, aunque personalmente casi no los uso. En cuanto a grabaci\u00f3n continua, yo le coloqu\u00e9 una micro sd de 64 gb y me graba 6 d\u00edas sin parar, cuando esta se llena, se reemplaza automaticamente con la nueva grabaci\u00f3n pero se puede optar por contratar el servicio de Tapo en la nube con una cuota mensual que tampoco es cara.NOTA: No se paga absolutamente un peso por ninguna de las funciones, excepto por la suscripci\u00f3n en la nube si se opta por ese servicio.",
