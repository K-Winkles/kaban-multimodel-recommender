It was a bit clunky to connect to my iPhone 14 via the app the first time, then inexplicably disconnected - took me a while to reconnect it and I am not confident in the procedure. It attaches magnetically to a stand, and the stand to a surface via adhesive. This defeated the purpose I had in mind to be able to move it easily from room to room as needed.The video quality is OK - I have a hard time seeing this as 1080P resolution.Overall, the connection issues were the biggest issue from me and quite a headache.",

Downsides... there are plenty first of all being it isn't the most friendly camera to set up and connect to wifi. If you work through it and you are patient... you can get it connected. Video quality isn't the best, but not terrible given the size of camera. The mounting stand has adhesive so it isn't easily moved... I fixed that problem by attaching a velcro pad to the bottom. Does it work... technically yes. Is it great? Not that great.",

                "reviewText": "Review for: \"WiFi Camera Mini Wirelss Home Security Indoor Camera, Phone APP Live View, Motion Detection, Night Vision, 1080P HD (Fashion Black)\"I really like the form factor, which is tiny little camera. But it is below average performance for my use application. The included micro usb charging port is a nice feature. And it can be used while charging, The built in battery live is short that understandable because of the small form factor. It only accept 32Gb micro SD max which is pretty small by today standard.The deal breaker for me is, it is very laggy, not responsive. Maybe due to slow processor. And the image quality is not so good. In contrast lighting, the shadow have no details. In proper lighting the image is okay. Even I choose 1080 resolution, I don't see it as sharp as average camera. If they put a better sensor, it will be a perfect miniature camera.For baby monitor in a proper lighting it is usable, but not for my use case.",
