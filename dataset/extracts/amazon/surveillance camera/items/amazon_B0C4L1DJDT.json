I don\u2019t need them to record so I\u2019m not paying for the recordings. It\u2019s just to check up on them while I\u2019m at work. I love how they turn and I can see the whole room instead of your typical camera that just one picture, I like the sound they\u2019re pretty loud they were very easy to install to my Wi-Fi I like how they zoom in the picture quality is OK they do have a flash which you can manage on the app but nighttime vision is pretty clear as well.Overall, I recommended for basic useI\u2019ll give them a 7/10",

But once connected, it seems to work quite well. Not sure if I'm going to keep it though, since I'm looking for an actual wireless camera I can charge, then set anywhere.
