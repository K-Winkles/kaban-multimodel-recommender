                "reviewText": "The alarm clock is really compact, which I personally like. The LED digits are quite bright and I'm not sure if this will stay on the night stand long-term for that reason. One thing I particularly liked was that the camera is virtually invisible. Looking at the face of the alarm clock when the lights are on, I can't make out the location of the camera.",

                "reviewText": "Poorly made, difficult to set up, would not keep correct time and also no way to set to 12hr format, would not take or record pictures. Attempted to reset and would never connect to app; I kept getting a \"device offline\" error. Waited \"patiently\" as per the instructions (which were poor as well), and never could get it to re-connect to the app. Deleted and reloaded the device on the app to no avail. If you like beating your head against the wall and wasting your money, this clock camera is for you. If I could give it zero stars, I would. Unfortunately for me, the returns window has closed, so I'm out $50 on this piece of junk. It's on it's way to the landfill next time the garbage truck comes by. Seriously, buy something else...",
