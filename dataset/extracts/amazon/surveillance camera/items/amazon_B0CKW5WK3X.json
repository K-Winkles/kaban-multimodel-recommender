You simply download an app, scan the qr code and you are in business. The solar charger works great even in late afternoon winter sun. The photo was taken before I mounted it so the screen is the reason it isn't as clear but even through a window screen the quality is very good. The motion alerts come through quickly to my phone and I would not hesitate to replace my garage camera of 2 years with this model. These cameras are great to keep an eye on my house while I'm at work and make sure our pets are cared for while on vacation.",

So far, we are pleased with the results. Day and night vision is decent. In fact, night time vision was decent, as anything with a form of heat/body heat showed up in white. For example, someone walked up to our front door steps in a black jacked and the jacket detailed in white on the phone, so easier to note someone in the dark. What was a surprise, is there is a microphone within the camera, so you can speak to someone outside through your phone. Quality of cameras are excellent, installation was not difficult. Would highly recommend!",

If cable company never controled your wifi ,the one out in the center of the garage works good, but the front porch one is futher away and it won't turn because the wifi is to far away and need a extender which the book that comes with them tells you this .Picture and even has a alarm that sounds like a sirfen when you get out of the car under the carport. Plus they will zoom in and out . Easy to install and with the 128 gb minisd cards you don't have to buy the cloud is nice ,but its another monthy payment and u got plenty of time gb to keep the video if a robber does break in ,and once a month just tap settings and reformat the sd card and u got 128 more space for videos . For the price I'll give them a 5 review . One more thing to keep in mine, is how far away you want to install ,u will need a wifi extender for them to move up& down and left and right . Pretty neat to be setting in the recliner and you can turn it to the left or right and zoom in and see the neighbors setting on their porch and across the street .And the cameras are quiet,u can't hear them turn and u can turn the indicater light on or off and u can set 7 days a week and what time u want to record . So easy to set up ,and give you the patterns to drill for the screw s go . 5 thumbs up for the sehmua pan tilt security camera battery/solar powered .",

                "reviewText": "The distance for the camera to receive and send data from the router was well over 150 ft and still able to stream on your cellular device. Also, the detection of movement is really sensitive to get any movement near and far to the camera. Works Good in all types of weather!",

Easy and fast to install, picks up sound and records from the end of my driveway to the house. My 2nd camera records my lawn, super!!! You can move the angles of the camera from your phone app, select areas to exclude, way more options that customize where you want to see. Highly recommend!",
