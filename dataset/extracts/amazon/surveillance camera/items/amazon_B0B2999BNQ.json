We have a little garden and occasionally animals will help themselves to our veggies... We have a monitored home security system and it works great but these can be moved and used anywhere there's a plug in and can connect to the router.These were so easy to install and test out. I would not use them where they might get rained on outside but on a back porch or from a screened in sun room it works fine. I liked that I could scan and turn it easy to see different angles. The one thing I did not count on is one place I wanted to put one was a bit too far from the router so it had problems connecting to the internet. Nothing wrong with the camera at all, just distance issue and I have a wifi extender/booster I believe I can use. I tested one out in the living room and thought heck I could use that in any room if we were not home and I wanted to check on things in an open area.. use it when I wanted to or needed and move it to another room anytime.. so easy. I planned to put one at our entryway so I can see who is coming by. I also want to put one in my husband's shop so I can check on him or know when he's in there working, or in the garage to know when someone pulls in.",

                "reviewText": "By the time you are sent alert whatever or whoever the intruder is is long gone. So you try to watch the playback off the expensive SD card you bought and all it does is keep throwing up a banner that says if you want to watch full videos you have to purchase their premium cloud feature.UPDATE!!!This thing is junk! It constantly turns to wall and does nothing cause it\u2019s pointed at a brick wall! If I try to play back activity, it either says that no video is available or to check my network cause it can\u2019t connect to camera! Even though I was connected to camera right before tapping activity icon! I even signed up for their cloud for a month with same results! I get alert notifications and it won\u2019t show those videos either! If I tap alerts from profile tab that has a red dot lit up on it, when I tap alerts it says no alerts at this time! I check my connectivity and it says excellent! So basically you are giving up your porchlite for this thing to waste a whole lot of your time and all it does is allow you to remotely see a delayed live feed ! I don\u2019t know anyone that is going to monitor a security camera 24/7 cause you won\u2019t be able to play back anything recorded on SD card or play back alerts with cloud fee paid service even. To top it all off , in order to call and get some customer service, you have to pay for cloud to be able to call customer service! This company is a bunch of crooks and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they weren\u2019t using your cameras feed to monitor you rather than you monitor a would be burglars! Don\u2019t buy this junk! Save yourselves the brain damage, waste of time and money! Zero customer service and the most infuriating piece of junk you will ever come across! I would give -5 stars if I could! Fraud at its finest here folks!",

Operationally no good. I don't think I want to buy a third that's just throwing out my money. Granted they are not super expensive but with today's economy I can't afford to keep replacing them.",

                "reviewText": "Honestly I have questions but the question bar isn\u2019t there so I\u2019ll just leave a full review in the meantime.I like the simplicity of this camera it was basically screw it in and it worked, except it actually took about an hour of trying a meal break and another 20-30 minutes to get it to connect properly but once it\u2019s on it\u2019s on!The issue I\u2019m having with it now because obviously I\u2019m not getting a subscription for it I bought a memory card. But it says the (new) memory card must be formatted in order to maybe work. Still tries to get me to subscribe to a monthly fee every time I go into the app to just see what\u2019s going on outside.So to get to my question is there a specific memory card I have to buy for it to work? I will try formatting the one I have but I\u2019ve never had this issue with other devices.I know there\u2019s really no way for me to get a response out of this review but maybe the seller could update the description of the item with a memory card that is best suited for this particular camera. I will update on wether formatting worked. The memory card I got is a ONN brand 128gb and it\u2019s not working properly.",

The App will show advertisements instead of someone trying to break and enter your home. It randomly alerts 6 mins of nothing and advertising buy iCloud subscription and gives a corrupt notification if you try to use a San disc recovery method. What a piece of junk.
