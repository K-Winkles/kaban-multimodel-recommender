Installed the second camera and tried to tuck the cord under my siding as I had the previous but the video adjustment knob is too large to discretely hide\u2026..video is very goodInstalled this camera to replace one that was damaged by lightning.After I finally forced myself the ladder and did the swap the image quality was not that great \u2026.but with the very kind guidance from Slina (ZOSI support) I was able to get that sortedVery happy with the result and although I have one more to swap I\u2019m sure that will also look great.One thing to note is if you are replacing an older ZOSI camera like I did the base on the new is smaller and would require 3 more holes\u2026.you can swap the mounting base fyiGo Phillies !",

I was a little disappointed upon getting them because I did not get into depth on reading this because it stated it was wireless. However, the setup is actually pretty good. Still trying to figure out a couple things. Once you get it hooked up. You definitely need to hit the restart button so it picks them all up but they are pretty clear and don't forget to take the clear covers off the lenses, It wasn't hard to set up, I was kind of new to all this and had a friend come out. I thought they had to be charged but they also do hook to solar batteries",
