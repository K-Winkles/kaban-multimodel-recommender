                "reviewText": "I got an Annke security DVR system a few months back to replace a 2006 era Q-SEE wired camera system, and I recently got around to installing it. The old system was a 4 camera one, and the new Annke system is an 8 camera system, but the model I ordered shipped with 4 cameras. I had planned to simply use my old cameras with the new system to fill in the remaining slots. However, after seeing the MASSIVE improvement in video quality, night vision quality (IR illumination), and an number of other factors, I decided to order 4 more matching cameras to upgrade to all 8 HD cameras. I didn't spend a ton to get a 4k system, but I am still quite impressed with the quality of the HD cameras (1920x1080). I can easily zoom in and read license plates, get good facial views on people, and see smaller details on animals, day or night. It's a huge improvement over the 960x480 system I had before, and for the price point, I'm very satisfied. I didn't have to swap out any wiring to replace my old cameras, and it was straightforward to wire up the new ones. So far, I'm impressed with the performance (and the DVR is SILENT, especially compared to my old one!)",

                "reviewText": "It has decent video resolution but the camera quality itself is cheap. It's a plastic material and could easily be broken if dropped or twisted too hard one way or the other. Night vision isn't the best either.UPDATE: September 5, 2017, I have decided to give the camera four stars. The response from the seller about my review was greatly appreciated. They contacted me to make sure I was satisfied and to ensure I wasn't having any trouble and that if I was that they could help me with anything I needed. I love sellers like these because it shows that they truly care about their customers. The camera quality itself is very good, the night vision outside isn't the best but inside it is very good. My big issue was the actual build quality it is a cheap type of plastic. Where I live one strong wind could break the plastic arm in half. I have replaced this camera outside with an aluminum one but am now using this camera inside. The camera so far has met my expectations as an indoor surveillance camera.Thanks.",

                "reviewText": "I keep buying these cameras because my old ones which costs $150+ each kept dying and not working after like just a year =/So, I saw these on Amazon and bought one just to try it out. Once I connected it, I noticed it has a wider aspect of view and clearer image as well. It's a 1080p camera and the image never looked more alive on the monitor. So I began switching them all out slowly and I couldn't be happier. Let's see how long these last. So far, so good!",
