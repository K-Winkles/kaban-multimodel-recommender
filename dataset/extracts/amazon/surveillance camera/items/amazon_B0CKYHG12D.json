The app is better than the others as well (although I'm really hopeful for some more improvements). It is small, but may still be difficult to conceal depending on the requirement - its about the width of a 9v battery and half the thickness but a little longer.",

                "reviewText": "This is another small camera that is good for surveillancing your home. It's about the size of a usb thumb drive. See pictures. It does get hot too just like its other model mw5l but it works fine. I use it 24/7. I like that it can resume its operation when power is restored. No need to reconfigure. Also i use its continuous recording then push alarm to my phone. The alarm is like my bookmark of what time an event happened then i can go back on the recorded video on that exact time and can see the whole event before it happened . During and after it happened. The other thing i like is that it records its videos in a 30 minutes interval and syncs to the 30minutes of the hour. Doesnt matter when you start recording it adjusts itself 30minutes so videos are organized and easy to search. The motion detection is also responsive but theres like a few seconds like 2 seconds before it starts sending alarm but thats why I use its continuous recording so i see the whole picture. Since this is a thumb drive size and no built in battery you need to plug external wire and that makes it a bit more visible. But you can always position it to hide the wire and itself. Night vision is good but i wish i could turn it off if not needed so that it can show me in color. It turns the video black n white when night vision is on. But overall I recommend this camera. It works.",

It's set to UHD, but with and without the cap, it has a red/purplish haze to the video. In a fully lit room, it jumped to night vision and now I cannot figure out how to get it off of it (just records everything in black and white now.I was planning to set this up in our front entryway, which is always lit (5000k/daylight), but if it's only going to record black and white, I'll just get another standard security camera. I just got this because I didn't want some large camera mounted on the ceiling.I also only had it plugged in testing it for about 15 minutes, and it was crazy hot when I turned it off. I'll test it more another day and update this if it's somehow way different than what I'm seeing initially.",

The picture quality is great and the night vision is superb, especially if you add additional IR lights to help illuminate the area. The range with the provided IR lights is decent but if you want to view things further away, then you'll need additional light. That's pretty standard for cameras of this type.I love how compact it is and it really blends in well. If you have a few remotes for TV's or anything techy like that, this would probably not be noticed at all if it were sitting amongst them.I really don't regret this purchase at all and I plan to buy a few more.",
