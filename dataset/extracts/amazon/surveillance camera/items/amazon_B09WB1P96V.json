                "reviewText": "The look and feel of this product is very good quality. It is easy to install and the App that is used works very well. The images are crystal clear...even at night ! Best of all is the stand alone feature. You can use an SD card to save all of your images and videos. You do not pay for any type of service or subscription fee. You can, if you decide to...purchase cloud space to store your images and videos at reasonable prices. It looks like you have to purchase an AI package to use the full features for motion detection which identifies humans, vehicles, packages, and I think cat and dogs. (I do not remember seeing anything about having to purchase this feature anywhere) The solar panel charges the camera with as little as one hour of sunlight and this eliminates batteries. There is absolutely no hard wiring involved to install these cameras other than the wire that connects the camera with the solar panel. I have not used the microphone yet but I am sure it works well as the camera picks up sounds very well. The pan, tilt and zoom works flawlessly. You can even record from live view as well as take screen shots of the same. It only works on 2.4 Ghz. This is not a problem for me. It gets the job done and from what I understand it gives you a little further range to set your cameras out. I would not hesitate to order more of these cameras, in fact I plan to in the future. I believe they have thought of just about everything to make it user friendly.",

The quality of the video and camera is really good and works great for keeping track of pets and Incoming vehicles. I would recommend the product and will be purchasing more in the near future.",

                "reviewText": "First I would like to say that Decko customer service is excellent. I had to call twice. Both people were articulate, kind and knowledgeable. Both spoke very clearly and I give them a 10+. They answered after a few rings and this was 4th of July holiday when I called. I don\u2019t consider myself a tech savvy person, but I am the \u201chelp desk\u201d in my household and usually can fix any TV, streaming issues or mobile phone issues. This was an off and on project all day. NOTE when getting your camera to connect to wifi, be sure and look at diagram in your brochure. Put the camera in the exact position in the diagram to figure out where the power button and reset button is located. The camera does not label the buttons. I charged the camera by plug before installing outside. The problem I had with connecting to wifi was my password to the wifi account. Luckily, the technician I talked to knew right away that due to my password starting WITH A LOWER CASE LETTER the app automatically makes it a capital and it will not connect. So, he had me retype the password and amazing, it connected right away. Too bad I spent a very long time trying to figure this out instead of calling them. Now I proceed with husband in tow to install outside. Well, of course, where I want to install the camera is a weak wifi signal, no good to hang there. So hubby goes to hardware store and gets a booster. Booster would not connect to wifi. I called their help contact number and after 1-1/2 hours on phone, I gave up. I ate my 4th of July hot dog and had a break. Then, I resumed trying to get the booster connected and a miracle, got it to work. Now we go into the next day and spend the morning installing camera. Played with the Cloud Edge app and by trial and error figured out how to use this app, which I do not want to pay for and one of my calls said I didn\u2019t have to subscribe to that service. I ordered a SD card which came today. It is pouring rain. In the mountains and the monsoons have started. In order to get the \u201chistory\u201d to work, you will need the SD card. So, this will be the next step. Take the camera down, figure out how to format the SD card and hang the camera back up. The camera is working. It takes great motion pictures some of the time. This is not the fault of the camera, but my wifi service. I am happy with the camera. Already I was notified and someone was in my yard. Luckily, it was the telephone service. I also got a night picture of a raccoon. The night pics are black and white and not that clear. We have lots of wildlife and I am hoping that I can get pics of the wildlife at night. Camera is a good price and does what I need it to do. Just be prepared, this may take a while to get it all connected and working. Good luck!",

                "reviewText": "I am very pleased with this camera. It was packaged nicely and very securely. The installation was very quick. It probably took all of about five minutes because you don\u2019t have to fool with wiring. I like that the app allows you to customize how sensitive the motion detection is based on your needs. Overall the app runs very smoothly and is easy to navigate. I have it installed on my Android device and it works well. I purchased a separate SD card to store images on the app. I think this is a great addition to using the camera and app to its fullest potential. When the camera is due for a charge, it is very easy to remove the camera from the mount and replace once fully charged.Overall, I highly recommend this camera. The main highlights are that you don\u2019t have to mess with wiring, it is very affordable, and you can have the peace of mind of having security without the contracts of a security system.",

                "reviewText": "First of all, I would like to say about customer service. Recently, my camera stopped working/connecting. I reset it and tried to revive it with no luck. I wrote to customer service with problem description. They were very quick to respond and sent me a new camera. I had it within days up and running again. Very good service. Thank you.I purchased this camera a few months ago for the front of my house. Security camera works great. Installation took about 30 minutes. This camera has a solar panel for charging. I had to find a spot where sun is always available. Unfortunately, I could not find a place where solar panel will be in full sun so I had about a month when battery was not charging properly. This particular camera holds the charge for about 6 \u2013 7 weeks in my case. It was good enough for the camera to start charging again. If you intend to charge it with solar panel, make sure you find good location for it. Picture quality is good. I would not say its hi def but it\u2019s enough for general purpose. There is a slight delay between time when object in detection area and time when it actually starts recording. If object is moving fast sometimes it kicks in to late to record. I extended recording time and it solved it in some ways but it takes memory from card and shorten the battery life. Camera fits only up to 128 go card. I had to buy a new one because I had 256 gb. Rotation is very useful when you need to change recording area or angle. I mounted on the corner of the house so I could adjust view anytime with app without climbing. App itself gives you many options to play with your camera: you can adjust, record, store images and videos in gallery, talk trough camera (I find it difficult sometime due to a time delay), activate alarm and many other useful features. All in all, it\u2019s a good camera and customer service. I would recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased 6 for a 360 view around a friend's home as well as my own. No complaints with the quality of the Cam for the cost. Picture is clear . Range is decent but I wouldn't go over 15 to 20 feet from the internet access point.The charge lasts long . The solar helps but ofcourse doesn't keep up with the cams especially if it's a high traffic area .I'd say I end up taking a cam inside to charge every 3 months on average. Charge on a Sunday I'm off for about 10 hours and it's good to go for 3 months again. Acceptable.Having 3 decks on the home helps . If you can place it at a height most people can't reach it without a ladder but you can from a deck , do it. The height isn't an issue regardless of the install instructions, as the vision range is decent so you can just adjust and aim it downwards. Better to not have it low in my opinion.Don't buy CAMS that aren't usable in the Cloudedge app in my opinion. I stick to the ones that can be monitored free on Cloudedge.Good luck !!!",

                "reviewText": "We have two Decko cameras now, this being the second one purchased. We opted for the solar option to give us continuous power and location flexibility. This camera is located away from power so the option was needed. The camera itself is excellent. Picture quality is crystal clear. Options for set up using the app are thorough and responsive. We store images to SD and this works as advertised. Power management is always a challenge using a small solar panel so your results may vary. We are getting continuous power on solar in winter conditions, but occasional re-charging on power might be required depending on your sun conditions. I'd like to comment on Decko's customer service. It is very responsive, professional and fair. Sophia has assisted me and done all the right things to resolve some issues I was having. My personal experiences with Decko reinforce with other customers seem to think as well, that Decko and it's team will work to get their products to perform as expected and make you happy. All in all, for the price, this is a very easy to use camera system that performs as advertised. Your specific needs and, in the case of solar, sun conditions, will have an some impact on your results. The system (including software) absolutely works and would cover off many use cases.",
