My only issue has been video playback but I think that's a troubleshooting issue on my part that I need to handle. Overall, there's a ton of settings/options to play around with and the motion detection works without subscription OR an SD card, It gives you a snap clip picture of what triggered the sensor, which I thought was pretty cool. (My camera is looking through a REALLY old, dirty window with a THICK metal screen you can hardly see in the image)",
