My phone is probably hacked by now. Does not work, and is garbage. Amazon should stop trying to sell this to customers. Bad business.",

                "reviewText": "The item description and the fact that they can't distinguish between an SD card and a micro SD card in their answers to customer questions should be enough to tell you that this item is not good.First, the slot for the micro SD card is not good. It consistently does not lock in the card. So, while I was recording hours of video thinking it would save to the card, it in fact saved it to the local device. That might not sound so bad, until you realize you cannot transfer that data to the micro SD card. That means you can only use the app for video playback.That itself wouldn't be the worst thing in the world, but the app playback is absolutely garbage. You cannot time scroll through the video at all. So, if you have 20 minutes of video, but need to see only the last 10 minutes, you have to wait 10 minutes of real time to get to the pertinent parts.There are also serious problems with maintaining a connection to the camera. You can tell it to record video via the app, but then, if you put your phone to sleep, it stops recording. The procedure here is to tell it to record, homescreen so the app is in the background, and then put your phone to sleep.Despite it being a useless item for most of its purposes, I gave it 2 stars because it does have motion detection (flimsy as it is), and it does actually take photos and pictures. But look elsewhere for mobility of data.",

                "reviewText": "The camera had a decent picture. It came through over the app fairly clear. Connecting the mobile app to the camera was confusing the directions were not very precise in word for word and step for step. The camera name and what was in the directions didn\u2019t match up, in addition to , the directions for locating the correct ID or camera was not clear as to where it would be found . Also wi fi and cellular instructions were no where near what was printed and were possibly for a different model. The biggest disappointment was for the sd card that is in the description for the camera that said was included with the camera purchase is not correct. The sd card was not included in the package delivered . For the price the camera itself is ok. Also, the power for the camera is not reliable it gets hot and shuts off . You get what pay for. Dont count on it for a reliable source. For fun it\u2019s just ok.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this to monitor my 3D printers from afar. Gonna buy more to add to my security at my shop. Very small. Easy setup. App is decent.1. Downloaded the app from Google Play.2. Connected my phone to the wifi broadcast from the camera.3. Inserted a micro SD and plugged into an empty USB slot with power.4. Formatted the SD inserted in the camera, no PC needed.5. Named it and put a password on it. Super easy if you've done any kind of setup for cameras before.I had expected the camera quality to be awful and very short range but instead I'm able to use one camera to watch both printers at the same time. For the price you can't beat it You just have to plan ahead to have a power supply. You could also Daisy chain this with a power block so that if the power goes out in your building you still have a recording camera. One big plus is the ability to turn off the light that so you can't tell that it's recording. Very stealthy.",

Tried, to no avail, to make it visible in another app. Yeah, it's a sweet little camera but don't forget to also order a powerbank.
