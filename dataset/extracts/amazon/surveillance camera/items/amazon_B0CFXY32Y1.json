What I like most about it is, it except 2.4 or 5 GB. The camera comes with lights and a siren, but you don't have to turn on the siren it has a on off setup. It has 4mp picture, it looks crystal clear. It has motion detection that follows what it detects if it is moving. Just a good security camera for the price less then $20.00, easy to setup it took me less the five minutes. It also has a setup for color vision at night or you can use black and white, I like the color.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first experience with any kind of security device, so I have nothing to compare with, but I have to say, it has been reliable and efficient. It does not cut out on me, I am running it 24/7 with an SD card, and it has missed nothing. Day vision is great. I can see nearly everything on my block as I pan my camera. The sound is great too. A couple of days ago I could have (but didn't) eavesdropped on my postman as he was talking on a cell phone across the street. That's impressive. I like the way I can get playback on my smart phone--it's easy for me to check what's happened when I'm not home.Night vision had been great up to about 15 feet. I don't know if that is normal or not. I can see things that are close to my house very clearly, but it drops off quickly after that. I can see cars that pass in front of my home, but not enough to make much of them and people fade into darkness that pass on my sidewalk. But should anyone come close to the house, the view is great. It seems to follow people quite well most of the time. Though I live in a city, I have deer that come right to the porch at night, as well as feral cats, and I get good coverage of them. I had no idea a 12 point monster mule deer buck lived in my neighborhood but I have great night shots of him now.For the price especially, I am very pleased with this camera. I think I will look for another one that will give me better night distance and clarity, as I am specifically needing a camera for protection against a stalker, but I will keep this one running too. I've only had it a couple of weeks, but it has handled -20 temps at night and snow and has been a champ. And it was super simple to hook up and operate. If they are all like mine, I heartily recommend it.",

It has really nice picture and video and zooms in. I will be ordering two more of these myself very soon.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this security video device from Amazon. It works great! Has so many features that the much more expensive devices have. Yet this one is just a fraction of the cost! I also bought a simple clamp on trouble lamp, that I screwed the device into. Clamped it to the rafter on our patio. We can see out front gate, and all the way behind to our patio doors. It notifies us when human movements trigger a notification. I also li,e that it plugs in. No batteries or solar charging. So we can have it working under the roof.",

It was simple to connect except our light had an old wiring and so my hubby went ahead and updated it while he installed this. So, that was a bonus. lol. Clear pics and short 10 second videos. I've not got any msg that it's filled up or that I have to record over anything yet. It does tend to alert to our grill cover blowing in the wind alot. lol. I still haven't figured out how to delete events on the SD card usage because it seems to only allow that for cloud usage, but that's ok.",

The camera comes with this Chinese app that I found easy to use. I\u2019ve set preference, home spot as well as defining favorite spots. I don\u2019t need it to patrol but I think it has that too. Since I have the SD card I did not need to buy any cloud service. The high def seemed a bit slower for my 2.4Ghz so I switched to the normal def. For the curious amateurs I recommend this highly.",

It\u2019ll do it for a bit and then stops and pick up again. I\u2019ll keep holding on to hope that it\u2019ll work with little flaws. The quality of the pics are good, no complaint.
