                "reviewText": "I only bought one of these cameras because I wasn't sure if I would like the app or product. I already use Blink and have Amazon echo products. So far this app is my favorite out of all of them, it's designed well and has a lot of options. It also is fast to upload and display video where echo is slow and blink is similar. The camera also swivels! The other two I have don't move and now that I found one that moves, I wouldn't go back to not having that option. You can save your favorite postions once you find them and you can zoom in to see better. You can set schedules to turn on motion detecting which is very easy to do. I like to call in to check on my pets and I'm not always in a place where I can have my sound on. The wansview app sound comes through my headphones, if I call into blink the sound will come through the phone which can be embarrassing, I cannot find the setting to change it and really just find the blink app lacking and disappointing. I got the blink devices because I thought they would be in the Alexa app but its own app. If I'm going to add new apps then I would want something user friendly like the wansview app with this camera. Also included is an extension which came in handy as the socket I chose was too deep without it. Also included is a regular outlet plug-in, if you didn't want to use a socket. I like that it's included because you may change your mind or want to move it somewhere without a socket so the variety makes it much more usable. I am so pleasantly surprised with this purchase!",
