We followed direction and watched the videos for troubleshooting and still it didn\u2019t work. I tried to return but it didn\u2019t give me an option for return after June 2.",

I could have just as easily crapped in a box and tried connecting that to my wifi and got the same result. I mean seriously Amazon, how about a little accountability. Stop selling this product and others like it. So yea I\u2019ll mention night vision, motion detection, and picture quality. These are all features one might expect when purchasing a camera. But I wouldn\u2019t know if this P.O.S. has them. I didn\u2019t make it that far. FYI I will be returning this turn but keeping the nifty little hard wire usb plug, for my trouble. So take that, Mr. That\u2019s that.",
