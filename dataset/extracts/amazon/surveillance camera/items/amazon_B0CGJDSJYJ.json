The video glitches a little even with the strong WiFi signal so if you need to place this Camera where the WiFi is still solid, just not strong, the Camera struggles to keep up. I have Ultra plan with Spectrum (500 mbps) with a WiFi 6 Mesh system and there's strong signal throughout my house. All devices, at any point in my home or outside border of my home, never see under 300 mbps when tested so my Internet is not the issue for the glitches. I run the EKEN doorbell and Light Bulb Cameras as well and they all exhibit the same issues... However, they still run good enough for my needs and the Cloud Subscriptions are VERY cost effective so I will continue to use and recommend EKEN. I just can't give any of their products 5 Stars at this time.",
