                "reviewText": "This is a good bang for your buck. Not a great bang for your buck. I\u2019ve used Yi for 3 years now. The monthly service( although not necessary - I used free service for over a year) is affordable and fairly reliable/ however it seems every time I want to go back and view something important ( my child\u2019s first steps) somehow the system \u201cglitched\u201d. I contact customer service, of course there\u2019s nothing they can do. I have a stranger in my front and backyard with a weapon visible / but I can\u2019t see anything but a blurry blob for his face in every single frame. Police department can do nothing with the images other than roll their eyes. I click live view to see if my babies are sleeping in their cribs soundly, well I can\u2019t even see the babies in their cribs much less tell if they\u2019re breathing or not. I suppose on 1080 being able to see chest rise and fall is too large an expectation, I don\u2019t know. Most other times the cameras are fine for MINOR, LIGHT, BRIEF surveillance. Please consider something on a much higher level if you need to really micromanage a business for theft, or have any security issues at home or business, You will be disappointed. If you\u2019re using these just for light surveillance at home / of your entrances , main common areas, tool or equipment storage or to watch your animals, you\u2019ll most likely be pleased. The cameras last forever. They are easy to set up and maintain. The free service is fine, we only upgraded because we have 6 or so cameras and I like live view of multiple cameras at all times plus recorded cloud and SD memory. It\u2019s worth the 9.99 monthly charge IF AND WHEN it happens to capture the images or videos I\u2019m searching for. It glitches out and takes a while to view often, but as stated I\u2019m not protecting a multimillion dollar museum of art, I use them for home security- in a safe secure area with more shotguns, rifles and rednecks than any other area of the US and I believe the cameras are just fine for that. If I lived in a high crime area I would consider another camera/service but for what we need they\u2019re pretty ok. They mount easily. The motion detection is good. They run on 110 plug- so if power or WiFi is down, so are they, and we must hide cords in two rooms that we have them mounted on ceilings. You must purchase SIM card for cameras to function properly. You can share live feed or video via text or social media and can share camera view by allowing access and giving login to other family members/business partners through the YI account. You will be able to see if anyone has logged in or viewed your account. It offers additional password protection for uncommon areas such as bedrooms. That\u2019s a nice feature. Over all good product. Yes I would purchase again. I\u2019ve purchased several over the past few years and bought my in laws a system for their residence out of state. If another company were to offer a better product and better quality viewing for a comparable or even a bit higher price, I would change over in a heartbeat. So there\u2019s my honest review. Hope it is helpful.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a cheap camera to watch my dog. I didn't want a camera that was going to try to charge me a subscription for every little feature. I checked reviews and this kept being recommended. The reviews were right! Decent quality picture, night vision, controls, motion detection with notifications, hear audio, ability to speak to your animal, can be accessed by mutiple people, take pictures, security pin, and live feed. All without a subscription. It takes videos when it detects motion but those do require a subscription to access. Controls have almost no lag and it goes side to side and up and down. Couldn't be happier and am thinking about buying at least one more. Also was super easy to setup and works with Google Home and Assistant.",

It is a bit rough around the edges. The orientation of the app is all sorts of messed up if you use it on an iPhone or an iPad and put the Picture in full screen. The subscriptions for premium services are also quite pricey; I\u2019m fine with that only if the software is more put together well. When looking at clips from the cloud, there is often a very bad lag.",

Their Customer Service was friendly, helpful and quick. Then Kami bought them out.Ever since it\u2019s been nothing but connectivity issues, lag, delay, firmware updates that don\u2019t happen, etc etc.But because I already had others, I decided to get two more, assuming newer tech would mean less problems. At least that\u2019s what their response emails to my issues said\u2026 Not so much.These are useless. You cannot control them from the PC app, only from the mobile app. And despite it saying EVERYWHERE on their website that it takes SD up to 128, it doesn\u2019t. It caps out at 64. Doesn\u2019t say that anywhere. So now I have 2 128SDs I can\u2019t use and a camera that won\u2019t record.New Customer Service takes days to get back to you (if they do at all), they are rude, only give canned responses that don\u2019t fit your question, and then tell you to just buy their monthly service instead.Can\u2019t help but feel that this is a bait n switch to force you to use their cloud storage service.Never again willl I buy them, never again will I recommend them.

                "reviewText": "Thru the years, we have bought a dozen of these cameras\u2026 watching pets, then kids, and then elderly parents front/back doors.We started with a couple of cameras and liked the App. So, bought more.They do break down after a few years, but still a good deal given the low price. We just replace them with new Yi cameras.Initially, there were no Ads when you open the App. Then there were Ads every time I open the App about Yi\u2019s cloud service and Kami service program. It was annoying, but I can quickly close the box and view my camera.But in the past year, in addition to their own Ads, they have added Ads from outside companies that you can\u2019t just easily close quickly. The Ads stay on for several seconds before it allows you to close, and you\u2019re forced to search the the Ad page looking for the close box. The close box is in a different spot every time and not always in English, so, you don\u2019t know which is the close box. And many times, I\u2019ve been tricked and tapped on the wrong spot and got re directed to the Ads website\u2026 wasting another several seconds. Then after I have to start over and go back to the Yi App.Before I can quickly look on Yi App and see who\u2019s there at the door. Now, with navigating the Ads, by the time I get to the camera stream, the person is long gone.So, the cameras are useless for me now. Maybe if you\u2019re willing to pay monthly for their expensive cloud service, it\u2019ll be Ad free?We are so disappointed with Yi. Now with the Yi cameras slowly breaking down one by one, instead of getting more Yi cameras, we have switched to another brand \u2026. So much better not to deal with those Ads everytime I open the App!!!When I looked online, I found that many people have the same problems with these Ads. Just google the discussion forum on yi technologies\u2026 there are a lot of complaints about these Ads that have been added.Save yourself the frustration and Stay away from this brand !!!! There are better options out there for the same or lower price!",

A light on nearby helps in both situations.Make sure you buy a micro SD card! It holds a lot of video/data so it can run a long time (days) and not fill up.Overall 3 stars because it\u2019s really neat lol. Has a lot of settings you can tinker with. The night vision and the intercom features are cool.",

It's not obvious and requires you to format the SD card but at least it's not required to subscribe to the Yi cloud to view the SD card recordings. So I updated this review to 4 stars. Overall, the camera works well and as advertised. The reason I'm not giving 5 stars is even though I can now view videos on the SD Card, I still get the \"subscribe to the Yi cloud\" pop-up every single time I use the app. And I do mean every time. Besides this annoyance, everything else works as advertised.Old review: This camera would not be bad if they didn't force you to subscribe to their cloud service to be able to see the videos that are recorded on the SD card inside the camera. So the minimum additional cost for you will be ~$40 per year if you want to see videos which are recorded on the SD card you have to buy with this product. Seriously Yi?",
