                "reviewText": "I purchased this ARENTI Indoor Security Camera, 1080P Dog Cam Pet Camera for Home Security, 2.4G WiFi Wired Camera for Baby/Elder/Pet, Motion Detection, Night Vision, 2-Way Talk, Works with Alexa & Google Assistant from the seller Arenti Smart US for the price of $24.99 and it was shipped by Amazon Prime.After using a LOT of different security cameras over the years I am completely done with the whole house systems and I much prefer these wireless app controlled devices. They work in exactly the same fashion as the big systems, but you buy them one at a time and place them wherever you want as long as there's a nearby power outlet. In the case of there not being one close I just buy a long Type A Male to Type A Female USB Extension and the long thin cable is way better than running this stuff through my attic or crawl space and drilling holes.This particular camera went out in my garage. The app was a little different than some of my other cameras, but it is PERFECT for there. It's small so I was able to get it right up against the ceiling and get a clear view of my entire garage as well as the door so I can see if I ever accidentally leave it open.I've personally used this to watch the garage when I received a delivery of tile that came before I got home. Delivery guy called and I have a remote garage door opener so I opened the garage, he wheeled the pallets into my garage and I was able to watch the whole thing. Then when he was done I just closed up the garage and house was all safe and secure again.The image quality is good, especially for a $25 camera. I've had some $50-$60 cameras that have a similar quality and however much my Nest doorbell camera is, that thing is not any better than this and I think was a couple hundred bucks.Make sure to put in your own micro sd card for memory.",
