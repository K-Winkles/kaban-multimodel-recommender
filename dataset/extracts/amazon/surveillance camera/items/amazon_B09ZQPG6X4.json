My only issue is the motion detector it is very sensitive, especially with the bugs it will constantly send messages whenever it picks up any kind of movement and with the bugs attracted to the light it was sending messages every minute or 2, so we decided to turn it off other than that the picture quality is great, the 2 way audio has a slight delay but it's great I wasn't even expecting that, and I read some reviews saying that they couldn't pick up there camera when they left they're house I checked and I had no issue with that at all! I love this product so I think it was well worth the money, even the $100 subscription for a year, I have an autistic son who likes to elope (sneak out) so besides the alarms and locks these cameras also put me at ease that I don't have to constantly worry about him trying to get out of the house and get to Walmart for cereal and DVDS \ud83d\ude0a!!!",

                "reviewText": "At first I thought this was a pretty good deal. Good camera. Nice features. But, over time, I started noticing little things about it that has made me regret buying it. #1.) The follow feature: I love that it has this, but it doesn't work. It will turn the camera the complete opposite way. Then the camera won't follow the person or thing bc it's pointed away from them! So the camera just stays there, most of the time pointed at a brick wall, in my case, unless you turn this feature off.#2.) The app is absolutely terrible! When you try to pull up the history, say the last alert you received. It jumps back to the day before at a completely random time. I have only been able to view the history maybe 3 or 4 times since I've had the cameras. The picture quality is ok I guess. The color night vision is probably the best thing this camera has going for it!#3.) It says it doesn't record continuously, but one of my cameras will. The other one does not and I can't figure out how to change it!Overall, it sucks for ppl who can't sit around and just stayed glued to their cameras at all times. I wished I would have gotten something different bc this one simply is not worth the headache.*New issue.... The cameras will randomly say \"poor network connection\" but then when I go to the settings and check the network status it tells me that it's \"excellent\" or \"good\". I absolutely hate this product and wished I would not have wasted my money! I would not recommend this to anyone!",

                "reviewText": "My daughter bought a set of these cameras and liked them so much, that I also bought a set. When my daughter unboxed her cameras, they came with two SD cards.When my cameras arrived they did not contain the SD cards and I had to purchase them separately I bought Amazon basics. I haven\u2019t received them yet. I\u2019ll update my review after I insert the SD cards that I presume should\u2019ve came in the original boxThe cameras do work well they\u2019re very clear and overall I\u2019m quite pleased with them but I have reduced them from five stars to four stars because of the missing SD cardsUPDATE:My SD cards arrived. I made every attempt to reconnect the camera with the SD card inserted. However, I was not able to pair the device or get it to recognize the SD card was in it. I had to go and watch a tutorial to make sure I had connected it properly inserted it properly, I made at least four attempts to reconnect the camera in different ways and was unsuccessful. Each time I have reduced my rating from a four to a two. It seems as if they don\u2019t want you to use the SD card they prefer you sign up for their cloud services, which cost $100 per year .",

The app itself if you can find it, the included QR code goes to a website with a link that does not work, does nothing more than let you view the camera. All features are disabled, even if you have an SD card, unless you subscribe to their service. Once subscribed you can actually properly move the camera and view recorded footage. The motion detection is awful and constantly goes off when there is absolutely nothing there to trigger it. I purchased the two pack and will not even take the second camera out of the box.",
