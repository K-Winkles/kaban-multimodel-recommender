                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent value for money, can definitely take some abuse.",
                "reviewText": "I originally bought these as a budget camera to put inside one of my rainforest terrariums. The form factor of these ones was perfect, especially compared to their outdoor variants. I didn't expect these to last more than a month or two.Pros====- They've been rained on multiple times per day (from the mister system), fallen into the water basin, fallen onto some rocks, caked in mud, scratched up by reptiles, and 5 months later are still are going strong. For a not rated for this kind of abuse, these far exceeded my expectations.- Excellent price per value. This is incredibly helpful when you need multiple cameras to capture different angles.- Pretty good night vision for the price. I've seen worse night vision systems on more expensive models.- Decent enough image quality for the price. It's not anywhere near perfect, contrast is a bit lackluster, but it's good enough that you can see what's going on most of the time.- Low heat output. These average around 83 F in my terrarium and I've never seen one get above 88 F.Cons====- The app can be finicky. Luckily, it's pretty easy and straightforward to get the cameras set up in the app. I've used cameras around this price point that fail even that first step. The camera app is generally just buggy. They do update the application often though, and sometimes those updates do seem to resolve some of the bugs. It's not nearly as solid as other camera apps though.- Motion Detection is extremely spotty. I maxed out the sensitivity on mine, did not use activity zones, and it still misses some events it should pick up. Sometimes, it will be accurate enough to pick up a small worm peaking out from under a leaf and wiggling around. Other times, it blatantly misses a large human opening the terrarium doors with their face filling the entire frame.- Auto night vision will sometimes stay in night vision permanently. I wish there was a setting to set the threshold for it changing back from night to day. If you have a shaded part of your house, it will never be bright enough to toggle back from night to day.Conclusion======It's like $25 (as of this writing) a camera and survives a decent amount of abuse. I have about 5-6 of them now for my terrariums and have yet to have one fail. Despite it's flaws, you can't go wrong for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I have several other Kasa cameras with the pan and tilt function and have been very satisfied with them. I needed to add another camera and didn't need the pan/tilt option so I ordered this one. It was very easy to set up and connected to my existing Kasa app flawlessly. All of my Kasa cameras are managed in the same app. The image is great and the video is smooth. I can view live or recorded video from any camera online through the app. The night vision is great, except if you have it looking through a window you will get a reflection. In that case, go into the settings and turn the night vision off and the camera's low-light capability will be plenty sufficient to show you a good and clear black & white video. In the settings you have a great amount of options to control and limit many of the camera's functions. Definitely a great camera at a fantastic price. You will also need a class 10 micro sd card in order to save and view your recordings. A 16 GB card holds several days of recordings and automatically starts over.",

                "reviewText": "For how much this is, it\u2019s really great. I will say that the video does look a little grainy but considering the price, 10/10. I use it to watch my cat if I\u2019m away on a trip. I have the camera pointed at his food/water and it notifies me when there\u2019s movement so I can check on him. It\u2019s super light, the power cord is a lot longer than what I was expecting, I can zoom in, and the night vision is really good! I love that you can move the actual camera around from your phone too. It does lag a little but again, for the price? Absolutely fine. Setting it up is also insanely easy. Will def be buying another for dif part of the house!",

                "reviewText": "The camera is pretty good. Good quality picture, pretty solid streaming capabilities. Dislike that it breaks the stream up into segments of 3-5 minutes at a time even with a SD card inserted. Also dislike that you can't batch download selected videos in the app. Makes downloading large parts a pain in the butt when you have to do it one by one. Having to merge all the video files into one large video file is time consuming and can be frustrating. I'd like to see the videos to be one continuous video per hour of 24/7 recordings.",

Image quality is not the best, but it does a perfect job and notifies me every little person or object move and detects and notify sounds too. I have two already and placed the inside a friends house that is empty for now. It notifies any little motion that happens outside or inside the house. Motion or sound video clips are saved in to Kasa servers and I can review them or share them with other people. Recording service from Kasa is around $3 per camera per month. The camera has motion tracking which is an excellent feature. It rotates the lens to follow the person or car moving around. When motion stops, the camera lens goes backs to original position in which it was setup.",
