                "reviewText": "I bought Zmodo 720p HD Outdoor Home Wireless Security 2 Cameras about three weeks ago. First few days I've spent to login these cameras to my home network. That was not straightforward. First I've tried to link them through zlink as was recommended in some reviews. Cameras were working for some time than went offline. Have no idea why. I have tried Livechats. They were quite responsive and suggested several ways. But the cameras still worked unstable. I was rather disappointed for I like these cameras. They give quite good picture at day light and very satisfactory picture at night. Actually I was quite impressed for the quite good night picture from such a cheap devise. So, I did not want to return them back and continued my efforts. Finally, I have linked them as wireless devices. They both logged in as a group. I gave them different names and over more than a week test at different linked devices. The primary device is my cellphone. They work well on my computers - home and at work. So I can see a clear picture from both of them at any time. I have sheared them with my wife and daughter - they also do not complain. Moreover, wife follows all motion detections and informs me when I did not have time to notice this myself.Overall conclusion:1. It looks like they are sensitive to the local network features. One should try different ways to connect them.2. If the power was interrupted, they came back online on their own.3. The picture is quite good both at daylight and at night.4. I have found that the time I've spent to set up them worse to have the result: for $90 I have my backyard viewed at any time. I am going to buy two more to cover the whole area I want to be controlled. It really gives you peace in mind when you are out - you see what is going on at your backyard.5. The only one \"complain\" - when motion is detected the recorded time is too short, only five frames. Then motion is not detected over some time after (so far I did not found how long). ZMODO, in principle, suggests a solution for this through they clouds. I'm thinking to try this - one week is free.I really impressed for the price per value ratio and recommend these cameras for anybody who wants a cheap and simple solution. My friend subscribes with a surveillance contract and pay $40 per month. My two cameras cost me $90 and I have practically the same result without monthly payment. As I understand I can use up to 8 cameras in such a simple way.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. 2024 Update: I have had these cameras around my property since this original purchase in 2020. While one did not work out of the box (see original review below), I have come to love the ones that did and have even purchased additional Zmodo cameras. I have one camera placed such that it is exposed to 100% of the weather elements (full sun, rain, snow, wind, etc.). I have had to replace that camera 1 time since 2020. The rest of the outdoor cameras are installed under overhangs, and all other original cameras are still functioning!!Pros:- Hardy with great longevity! What other affordable tech do you have that can be exposed to the elements 24/7 for 4 years and still work as advertised?- Easy to install- Camera records motion in short clips for past 12 hours for free (no subscription necessary)Cons:- No microphone/speaker on these, so they do not record sound.- Must have constant 2.4Ghz WiFi connection to work- Night Vision attracts spiders to build webs. Make sure you put them in a place where you can \"dust\" off the front as mine tend to have little spider webs around them all the time in the summer months.- Unless you subscribe to a cloud recording, limited movement capture will only record movement on the camera every 3 minutes.Obviously you have to decide what you can live with, but for an entry-level security camera, these are hard to beat!Original Review: I have these cameras around my property, including the driveway and barn. They have worked great and were easy to hook up. Unfortunately, I didn't hook all 4 up immediately. I only hooked up 3. The last one has been in a box for a year and now when I need it, it will not connect to the network, and therefore is useless. I have tried all the steps to add it, but it won't connect. In addition, my router can't see it either, which makes me think it is the camera versus something I am doing. The other three work great, but one is essentially a paperweight. :\\",
