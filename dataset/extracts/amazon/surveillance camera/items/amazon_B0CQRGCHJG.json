I do not have light sockets in my house so I used the included power adapter, using this makes it easy to place this camera just about anywhere. Setting up the camera took about 5 minutes and is very easy to do with the mobile app. There are many different settings for motion detection and alerts. The picture is very clear and high definition. I used an SD card (not included) to record for a few seconds after motion is detected and have it send an alert to my phone. You can also schedule days/times do turn off motion detection. I plan on getting more of these for my house, they are a great value for the cost.",

Super cool concept vs trying to find a place to install or if you rent worrying about possible damages to rental properties for camera installation. Only issue is with our outdoor light socket makes the image upside down, but if you hold phone at right angle the image is flipped, maybe an option to dip the image would be a great improvement option for others with similar set ups!

It does to get noisy from time to time but doesn't constantly have bad sound.The camera is as clear as well and you can hang it upside down or right side up and it adjusts the image. Very easy to install. I love the 5g that you do not have to call your cable company and switch yourself over to 2.4 for the duration of the setup.",
