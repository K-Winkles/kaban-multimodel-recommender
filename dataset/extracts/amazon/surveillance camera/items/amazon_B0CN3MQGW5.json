                "reviewText": "The Good:The image quality and motion detection look and behave well. The camera's USB charger disguise is perfect. That you can use it as an actual charger is clever and totally sells the stealth aspect of the device.The Less Good:The HomeEye Android app is a little clunky and crashy. It's not bad enough to warrant returning it. With a little patience, one can set motion detection sensitivity and Alarm parameters. Since I am using this with a 25GB SD card, I am confident that I can get at the recordings regardless of the app.",

I was not very sure about the quality first but after using it, I noticed that it's a very quality Cam. The video quality is good. App is easy to setup and you can watch live video and even record or download. I like the motion sensor recording. Which is very convenient and save a lot of storage. I suggest to go for this cam if you needed one and want a quality product. Also, it works exactly like a charger so no one will suspect it to be cam.",
