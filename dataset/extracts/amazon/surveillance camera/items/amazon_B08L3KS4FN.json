                "reviewText": "This is one of several Hosafe cameras I have in use at my home and business. Hosafe customer service has always been excellent and quick to respond. That said, this latest and newest camera they are offering is a good value for the price.The many features are very appealing, but their execution needs some development. More on that later. First, when taken out of the well packed box I was surprised that the camera is very light and made of mostly plastic (assume the UV rays of South Florida don\u2019t deteriorate the material as some plastics in the sun) and lighter weight to install. While the large dongle of wires (mostly the RJ 45 LAN connector) that usually are protruding out the bottom of the mounting base, this wire bundle exits out of the side of the base making wire management a bit more tricky if you want to hide them and protect their connection points. With the quicker set up on these newer cameras not requiring a hard wire to the router initially, I think the RJ 45 connector could be eliminated assuming you are only going to use the wifi connection which in reality is why you buy a \u201cwifi\u201d camera! That would eliminate the need to drill a \u00bd or larger hole to run those wires. As I have with the past 3 installations, I choose to mount my cameras on an outdoor plastic electrical box to terminate the wires and ease of attachment to the building. But this time instead of a large hole in the box cover under the base of the camera, I had to route the wire into the side of the box as shown in the photo. A bit tricky to keep it weather tight with a grommet.Now the features: The LED light source that comes on with motion is pretty bright and a welcome addition to illuminating the subject area and obtaining full color pictures at night. There is also an audible alarm but I am not using that for a good reason\u2026 the sensitivity of motion adjustment is adjustable but even at the lowest setting in the app, it is triggered with least bit of wind movement and even insects at night. So, the light is triggered often (that is ok with me) and that alarm would be a nuisance. The same problem comes into play with the other cool feature; motion tracking of the pan and tilt mechanism. Great feature and as stated, not real quick for fast moving objects but with the ultra-sensitive motion detection, it moves much too frequently. Also the range is pretty limited so as the subject moves out of the range (about 10 meters) the camera returns \u201chome\u201d and the subject is now out of the picture. Again, a great feature, but a bit of a delay upon motion ending and much broader sensitivity setting would be big improvement on these new features.Overall, the image is very clear and adequate resolution. Night vision (without the LED light on) is very good as expected. Wifi with the dual antenna is about average for me. I am only getting 60% on an outside, side wall about 15 meters line of site (through the house). My other cameras on the front side which are about half the distance are 100% signal strength with only 1 antenna. Your results may be better as there are many variables controlling wifi strength from inside to outside.The other great feature and the main selling point for me is you not only can use an SD card for image and video capture, but it is also ONVIF compatible to use the many camera security monitoring programs like Blue Iris and others. I am still experimenting with camera control on Blue Iris as it is registering with \u201cgeneric\u201d camera and all the features do not seem to be accessible so far.Lastly, the two-way audio works well and is another great feature for an inexpensive camera like this. I would buy it again.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been looking for a PTZ, dual band that is Onvif that wouldn\u2019t break my budget. This camera fit perfectly! So much so that I bought a 2nd one a week later. Very easy to set up & connect to both Camhi & Blue Iris. The picture is very clear, day & night. The PTZ has some lag, but that\u2019s pretty much expected with IP cams. I love that the cord plugs directly into the back, so there are no plugs (Ethernet, power, reset that most IP cams have) hanging down. Installation was a breeze because the back plate is separate & is attached first & then you just slide in the camera base & secure with 2 screws. Took me maybe 10 minutes to program & mount the camera. The one thing I would suggest is that if you\u2019re using this outdoors that\u2019s it either under a porch or overhang or some type of cover. The housing is completely plastic, so not sure how well it would hold up to rain, snow if is out in the open. For the price, it\u2019s a steal!",

                "reviewText": "so the good. the camera is easy to setup and install. has good range for the wifi connection ( but my router is not the average router ether). great picture. and has lots of features that other cameras don't have. playing with ISpy. this camera is not in the ispy directory but using a generic setup in ispy can get the camera to do the basics but not able to do everything the camera is capable of. this camera runs off of 12v and for me that is a great thing. No this camera is not able to run off of battery. but for me this is a none issue because i know how to put a battery in line. and the fact that it is 12v not 5v or some other form factor means i don't have to build a transformer to put the battery in line. now the bad. it does not currently work with alexa or google. but there website states they are working on this. as many features as this camera is able to preform and can't get those features to work in ispy or blue iris or that this camera is not directly supported by ether platform is kind of a let down. but i understand these are third party programs to the camera and hosafe probably has no say in it. now the ugly. the cables to run the camera are only able to go out one side of the base of the camera. and the reset button is easily gotten to as it is out there with the power cable and the ether cable. the reset button does have a weather cover on it where as the power and ether connection do not. i don't like that the reset button is that easily gotten to by joe blow walking by. so to fix this i will be putting some heat shrink on it to try and make it hard to get it. as stated before the ether port does not have a weather guard on it and does not look like it is sealed inside to protect against the elements. again heat shrink can fix this. the power connection looks like it will seal ok with the power cable that was provided but does not seal completely. now this should not be a big problem as the negative connection is on the outside of the barrel connector and should not arc. but the connection is not hidden and again is easily gotten to by someone that wants to unplug it and again i'm going to sure some heat shrink around the connection to help protect it and to help deture someone from just coming by and unplugging it. and the last thing that i can put in the ugly section, the length of the power cable that comes with the camera. from wall wart to connector is less than 3 feet. and that is counting the wall wart of the connector. for average joe this could be a show stopper because that does not even reach across my little computer desk. so that is a lot of ext cord to run around outside to get tripped up in and have to try and protect from the weather so something does not spark catch fire. now if you not the average joe the power cable can be spliced and extended safely if you know what your doing. 18-20 gauge outdoor speaker wire, solder and heat shrink will work wonders. and the wires in the supplied cable are color coded run next to each over instead of a hot center and negative shield format.",

The night vision feature is useful and provides image in color with the help of the floodlights. Those could add extra security for people living in remote and unlit areas;- Fast and easy installation of the apps on both smartphone and computer;- I like interface of the both apps very much.There are some things that could be improved though, as follows:Cons:- Very short power adapter cable. I had to buy an extension cable in addition to the camera;- Even though OVNIF feature is great, the instructions are not clear on how to configure the 3d party app to be able to display camera image.I still recommend the camera, because in my view, the pros outweigh the cons. By the way, the customer service is swift and helpful.",

I expected it to die when the temps hit -40C/F, but it kept on working. So I bought another one. Same thing, Worked Perfectly....until I switched providers. When I switched to Starlink, I had to remove and re-install the cameras without an ethernet cable (Starlink doesn't use ethernet cables). I had no idea how to even guess at fixing this, so I contacted customer service. WOW! Step by Step all the way!!!! All the questions were answered!!! The clarity on these cameras is stellar. Tracking someone is Excellent. And for an added bonus, I love the fact that I can talk to people from 100 ft (Yeah, I did measure it 105ft using a range finder) when using the intercom features. My only complaint, and I mean ONLY complaint is that it is white and my neighbors can see it from 100yards away, contrasted against my log home. I see a nice solar camera is available, and will probably try that out as well. GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!",

                "reviewText": "I just purchased this camera for install in a horse barn, the barn has WiFi access and the WiFi is connected to the internet.The camera itself is as expected plastic, seems light duty and is a good size fairly small for what it is, it can be placed discretely.The image quality is great when set to \u201cHD\u201d, the intelligent night vision with combination IR and white visible light works very well, With auto motion tracking enabled (disabled by default) I can enter the barn at night, it tracks me and turns the visible flood led lights on and I can easily see to the light switch for the barn! It does what I wanted it to do.The only downside or negative I have is that it was very difficult to get it to connect to my WiFi AND come \u201conline\u201d so I could check by my cell phone.WiFi and internet work fine, signal strength was a bit low where I installed the camera at 60% (as per camera app) it took multiple multiple setup attempts to get it to finally work about 30 tries at resetting and re connecting then eventually one time it came online, I did the same exact procedure every time!In every case I was able to initially connect to the camera directly through its internal WiFi AP (WiFi hotspot) set up the camera then when telling it to switch to the barn WiFi network the camera would connect and sing its connection song, my phone would switch over to the barn network but the camera would remain \u201coffline\u201d in the camera app.I did this over and over and I was just about to return it tried one last time and it worked, in every case when the camera app showed the above I checked my cell phone WiFi access and had no issues checking the internet over WiFiThat all said now it works great and as it should I can check over my cell network the camera, it notifies me of movement, can review footage all remotely, if I go to the barn I can connect to the barn WiFi and do the same alsoThe instructions are not the greatest but if you want to save a ton of money and have time to fiddle this is the camera for you! My friend spent $90 on his barn camera and this one has more features, same image quality, the only difference is his did connect initially easier",

Note that the motion detection feature is not compatible with Synology Surveillance Station. The two bottom screws are practically inaccessible to tighten.Update after using two cameras for a couple of weeks and replacing both of them:The app has serious shortcomings:1. It has a button \"preset positions\". Don't touch it! As I was explained later by tech support, this camera does not support several preset positions. This is not written anywhere, though. If you try to set preset positions, the camera return to home position after tracking will become erratic: t may go to any position, including facing the wall. That was what I did, and that was what happened. Tech support tried to fix it afterwords, without much of success. That was the reason for replacing both cameras.2. There is an option of checking for new a FW. According to Tech support, don't try this as well. So why the option there, then?Generally, the tracking is good, but the return to home is not very reliable (even if you don't mess with the preset positions). Although rarely, the camera will freeze at the end point of the tracking.The Windows application, which BTW is free share, is slow and for some reason will use only the secondary, Low resolution stream. Any attempt to switch to main stream will not work.UPDATE: Down to one star :( After roughly a month of using, one of the cameras started issuing false alerts, one after the other, only in the night. Practically, this makes the camera unusable in nighttime. Lowering the sensitivity to 1, does not help. The CS is wortless. It is available 24/7, but cannot resolve simple issues. Maybe they are unresolvable? The so-called \"Humanoid alarm\" is a joke - every moving thing is \"humanoid\": crow, squirrel, even a wind-shaken bush.Next step: get rid of Hosafe and change the brand :(",
