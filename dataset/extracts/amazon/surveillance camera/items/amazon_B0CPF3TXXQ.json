Then every 2 days the camera goes offline and doesn\u2019t work. This is not a problem with my wifi or router. I have to completely remove the camera from the app and repair it , which takes about 10-20 tries to get it to rescan the QR code for it to work again, then 2 days later offline again. I would suggest saving your time and investing in a higher quality camera. They even sent me a replacement camera but it\u2019s having the same exact problems so it\u2019s not ideal when the camera keeps disconnecting and going offline every 2 days.
