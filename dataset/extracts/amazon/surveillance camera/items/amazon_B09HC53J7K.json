                "reviewText": "There is nothing to dislike about how these cameras function. They installed seamlessly into my system of LaView cameras of all types. A simple camera scan of the UPC symbol that presents itself on my phone and it's done, set up...finished and functioning. The only limiting factor is my internet service not being what it should be...and the only affect that has is a slight delay in live view streaming that would not exist at all if I had better ISP service.I can access my live view with sound and two way communication from anywhere at any time. I can replay locally recorded content from the cameras SD card which records 24/7, non-stop. I can keep several days at a time and the system simply records over the oldest day first once the card becomes full. Additionally, the cloud service holds event recordings for 2 weeks (on the subscription I use, 30 days on the other plan). So if someone should destroy the camera and SD card, I still have the evidence needed to know what's happening. The event recording and the push notification of movement detected takes place so quickly, that 99.9% of the time the object moving thru the frame that is the trigger is captured in the notification. This is a major problem with most other systems at this price level and many that are more expensive.The night vision is beyond fantastic. These have a spotlight feature that illuminates the area upon motion detection and can also use AI Human Body detection to be more discerning about what takes up recording storage space saving memory.I strongly recommend the Laiew system to anyone wanting survailance security, whether it's one PTZ camera with motion tracking, or multiple stationary 2k cameras like these...or any combination thereof. Do not hesitate to install this very user friendly, quality system. The cameras available will fit any circumstance imaginable and ALL have 2 way communication. This is the best affordable system available on the market today that are way more capable than any others I've researched at the same price point. Simply put.... simply AWESOME !!!!As you can see in my uploads, the picture is crystal clear and when the infrared night vision is activated, the picture is still just as clear albeit black and white, of course.",

                "reviewText": "Crystal clear 2-megapixel image quality, automatic day/night mode, motion detection, human detection, floodlights and mini sirens built into the cameras, and it's all configurable if you know what you're doing. Most people will be fine with how it comes right out of the box.Setup was super simple once I sorted out my own hiccups like bluetooth discovery and enabling the 2.4G side of my wifi system. Adding and naming devices is basically instant, and I had a 4-camera system fully installed between 8am and 2:30pm. 5th camera going in once the rain stops.Both motion and \"human detection\" functions do produce some false positives here and there, but for a $100 camera system I have nothing to really complain about - you get what you pay for, and the good far outweighs the bad.Their cloud storage plans are very affordable. I'm using microSD cards plus cloud. (if they go offline they still record to the internal card).",
