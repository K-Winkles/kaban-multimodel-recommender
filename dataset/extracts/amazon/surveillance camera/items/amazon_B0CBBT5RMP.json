The app itself is user-friendly, making the whole experience quite enjoyable.Integration with Alexa and Google Home adds to its charm, making it a perfect fit for my smart home setup. The night vision capability is another highlight. It provides crystal clear images even in low light, which is super reassuring.The 2-way audio feature is fantastic. The sound quality is great, and it\u2019s fun interacting with my pets while I\u2019m away. Plus, it's quite handy for quick communication with family at home.Setting it up was straightforward and quick. Once it\u2019s running, it\u2019s really low maintenance but high performance.In summary, if you're looking for a reliable, high-quality indoor security camera, the Cinnado Security Camera Indoor-2K is a superb choice.

The app has a lot of features, allowing control over the camera's position, alerts, access to stored videos and snapshots, etc. I was a little confused about where the SD card went, but soon found the slot just beneath the actual camera lens. This allows local storage of video for the longer term as opposed to using the included time-limited cloud storage.All-in-all, I was impressed with this camera's capabilities, clarity, and price point. I think it is an excellent value and a good choice for corded camera use cases.",

                "reviewText": "This four pack of cameras have exceeded my expectations. My review has 2 photos of the box of all 4 cameras inside and out, photo of a single camera and all pieces you will need to install a single camera, photo of the camera installed inverted on the ceiling, and lastly 2 photos from the camera itself.I ended up using nano tape to install on the ceiling and not the mount with the screws so I didn't have to put a hole in the ceiling and that works fine also the camera is very lightweight and the nanotape I use is very strong. If you mount the camera in the middle of an entryway between two rooms you can view both rooms entirely.The night vision on this camera works very well you can see very good with very little light, there is also an option to turn the infrared light vision off completely if you have another light source at night and the camera stay color with that option.The daytime view is crisp and clear way better than I expected for a camera of this price, The last two photos of my review are screenshots from the camera app itself you can see for yourself the clarity. The wansview app allows pre saved location so you don't have to move the camera manual every time you can have kitchen living, room hallway, etc and the camera will go to the pre set location on the push of a button. The camera picks up a very wide area and rotates almost 360\u00b0 around, if you mount it on the ceiling like I have you can pretty much pick up every part of the room. If you're using it to watch your pets you will not be disappointed, The response when moving the camera remotely is pretty fast also better than the other brand cameras I've used.This camera takes up to 128 GB SD card which you can view the footage from the wansview app locally or remotely without taking the SD card out or even touching the camera. There are many different cameras to choose from these days but you will not be disappointed with this one for indoor security or monitoring. To set up of this camera is easy also you just download the wansview cloud app, Enter your network login details, then you will get a QR code you just point your phone screen at the camera and it will scan the QR code and then it's installed instantly.",

Camera works great and seemless in the Wansview app.Easy to connect (Alexa compatible)no local storageexcellent images in HD (SD is very good too)Excellent video, Sound is good and motion is smooth.This is my favorite indoor PTZ camera so far, not only is it exactly as described, but there are a few nice surprises they didn't mention. When I started looking for this type of camera, it was really difficult to make a decision based on reviews and had to try several until I found one that worked the way I wanted. If I had started with this camera I would have bought more. You can buy cheaper cameras, but after all the $20 cameras that were far below par, this camera is well worth it. I will definitely be buying more of these for myself and as gifts",

Die Nachtsichtfunktion \u00fcberzeugt durch ihre Klarheit und Reichweite.Funktionsvielfalt :Von der zuverl\u00e4ssigen Bewegungserkennung bis zum Zwei-Wege-Audio \u2013 die Kamera bietet eine beeindruckende Palette von Funktionen. Die Echtzeitbenachrichtigungen bei Bewegung sind besonders hilfreich.Verbindungsstabilit\u00e4t :Die Verbindung zwischen Kamera und App ist stabil, ohne Verz\u00f6gerungen oder Verbindungsabbr\u00fcche. Selbst bei schw\u00e4cherem WLAN-Signal arbeitet die Kamera zuverl\u00e4ssig.Preis-Leistungs-Verh\u00e4ltnis :Angesichts der gebotenen Funktionen und der Qualit\u00e4t halte ich das Preis-Leistungs-Verh\u00e4ltnis f\u00fcr sehr gut.Fazit:Die D1 2K Indoor Securitiy Camera ist eine super Wahl f\u00fcr alle, die eine zuverl\u00e4ssige Indoor-\u00dcberwachungsl\u00f6sung suchen.

                "reviewText": "Setup was very quick, within about 2 minutes I had the camera setup and my preferred settings all plugged in. The cable is a good length so most users would probably have no issues reaching a plug socket. The shape of the camera is also good - some other models are too heavy and fall over quite easily, whereas this one is very stable and wouldn\u2019t be easily knocked over by a pet for example.The camera picture is high definition and the IR night vision is extremely clear - an upgrade to the previous indoor cameras I have used. The mic and speaker function also works well and the sound is fairly clear for such a small unit.The ability to move the camera remotely is really useful. I use my indoor cameras to keep an eye on my pets when we are away during the day and if we go on holiday, so being able to move the camera slightly to get a better view is brilliant. It\u2019s nice and quiet, so my pets don\u2019t seem to be bothered if the camera moves next to them. Also the ability to save preset angles just makes this even more user friendly and is a great function to have.No problems using the Wansview app (as I do with other cameras) to view live video, check motion alerts and record footage to a micro SD. Overall easy to use, good value and does a great job for my needs. Really pleased!",
