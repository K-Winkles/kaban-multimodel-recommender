                "reviewText": "The majority of reviewers in YouTube seem to be positive and they absolutely love this product, a light bulb fixture surveillance camera, unfortunately I am not one of those people that is definitely not happy with this product. There are a lot of reasons why I won\u2019t be buying this product again and I really don\u2019t know why so many people love product with all the problems I am having with this surveillance camera. I live in a very windy state out west and evidently this surveillance camera was not designed to be used where they live is windy. I am sure that a lot of people except the surveillance camera to shake quite a bit in very windy weather but the surveillance camera seems to get confused in heavy wind with the wind blowing the camera moves left and right and left and right very rapidly like it is possessed by something evil, moving back and forth very rapidly in all directions and when it gets that way when I need to control the in which I want the surveillance camera where I want it to go it won\u2019t let me have control where I want to look like the surveillance camera has a mind of its own and I am fighting with the surveillance camera to allow me to have control of it to see where it want to see not where it wants to look. Even on a light breee of a day the surveillance camera goes crazy wanting to watch the leaves in the trees blow back and forth and a shopping bag blowing in the wind it\u2019s got to watch the shopping bag blowing in the wind. When I take the dogs out the camera would rather look at the door frame of my front door than ti watch where me and the dogs are going. This surveillance camera ha no problems informing me that it loves to watch the moths and flying bug that are attracted to the light from the surveillance camera and surveillance camera seems to love all the attention that it gets from the moths and bug\u2019s attracted to it\u2019s light to the point it doesn\u2019t go where it want it to go. The online cloud that stores videos and records alerts is worthless and definitely not worth $120 a year when the only alerts that I see recorded is of no importantance to me that mostly records the leaves blowing in the trees and bugs and moths attacked to the light of the surveillance camera and unimportant things that I don\u2019t need recruitings of and the camera very rarely records vehicles and people going up and down the street. Lastly if I lose internet connection the surveillance camera is difficult to get reconnected back on the network ad this surveillance camera is more of a frustration to me than a help to me.",

                "reviewText": "I am disappointed. They want you to buy their service. Even if you have the SD Card..(I got 2 SD cards with 1024 GB and still you cannot view the videos. I stood infront of the camera for about 20 seconds and all it caught to view was my shoulder. It is a nice idea, but it is an ABJECT FAILURE as a security device. Except for the feature of screwing into a socket all it can do is be a possible visual deterrent. Not a practical useful deterrent. If you want to get real visuals and be able to view from my SD card (which cost more than the 2 useless cameras).Attached is the notifications from the app on my phone. You cannot put it near a plant. Every breeze that blows it says it a person going by. There WAS a dim motion detector light which lasted for a week. Now that doesn't work. One time I came and saw the camera swinging from left to right for no reason (via remote phone). I panicked.... I thought someone was trying to break in. I was able to turn off and on the camera remotely. Still cannot see what actually occurred.This in my view IS AN UNACCEPTABLE PRODUCT FOR EVEN SECURITY OF A RATS HOUSE. It is a awful product. Good idea, but awful product. If I had tried to set up right away it could have been returned. I have bought 3 other cameras and THIS TIME I TOOK THE TIME TO READ THE REVIEWS.",

Good picture quality, and very responsive when motion is detected.Easy to connect to local Wi-Fi network.Nice touch on the added free accessories - Socket extenderThere are 2 options to view/store captures. Micro SD card or cloud ( not free option)Viewing live on cell phone is good. but if using SD card storage not able to view ( not stable )However when using the pc/windows version of the app it is very good.There is no option to loop the recording on the SD card ( when SD card gets full, it will not record over. Had to format the SD card manually.Speaker quality is not that great, very tin sounding.",

Eventually it became harder and harder to get it to connect and now it won't at at all. I always got an error code when trying to record with the SD card feature. And without buying the cloud, you can't save anything when the card reader doesn't work.Good thing they were cheap.",
