                "reviewText": "This is a great idea, but there are physical limitations which probably can't be removed which detract from its usefulness. First, the camera has to be close to the router, which is a severe restriction. Second, the battery in the camera is small, and so for it to be effective for long, it needs to be plugged into the power source, which is also a severe restriction. When these requirements are met, however, it does a great job, with the picture being a little jumpy, but that's ok. Some of the control icons are mislabeled, but this does not interfere with the use. I like it, but can use it only in certain places.",

In fact, it really can\u2019t handle hardly any frames.On the positive Side:-It does have a really small footprint-If you did use this thing as a nanny cam or whatever, you can turn the 2 toplights off so it stays in stealth mode.-It supports local SD Card recording-It\u2019s easy to start it up and get it added to the app and the main interface is pretty simple to utilizeOn the Negative side:-as I mentioned above, the frame rate is TERRIBLE along with the quality.-I tested using manual recording to the device I had connected to it and to the SD card. There is a resolution selector on the main Interface of either 480p, 640p or 1080p, but I think that MIGHT only be for the live view.. I couldn\u2019t get it to record in anything other than 640p. The actual recorded resolution came out to 640x472.-The quality is equally just as bad as the resolution. I\u2019m not joking. It came out looking like a cell phone recording from 2005. There is a complete lack of any detail. I tested both in a well lit environment before I tested Night vision later on.-The frame rate was also tested at (dot)10 FPS. Not 10 but POINT 10. Again, I tested both from the local SD card and manual recording to a connected Device. I made sure to go through all my settings and I don\u2019t see a way to record in at least higher resolution or higher quality. This is pretty much what you get. That makes the device almost unusable. You get so much ghosting on images that you would have to have exactly the right conditions to get a frame that is of decent quality.I really can\u2019t find any proper use case scenarios for this device. The performance is just too poor to be useful. It\u2019s unfortunate since It\u2019s a good size, they give you a micro SD card adapter, the app COULD Be better, but it\u2019s not completely difficult to use. I had more hope for this device but it\u2019s juts very disappointing. I would look elsewhere for a device of this type.",

These are my thoughts after almost two full months:What I Like:* The Size: It is small enough to hide just about anywhere* Feature Rich: Has Night Vision, Motion Detection, Local Storage, Live ViewingWhat I Do Not Like:* App Controlled: An app should simplify things, this one doesn't.* Ease of Use: Setting up and Configurating The CameraThere are instructions included but not detailed enough. Three different QR Codes are provided for different things. They are on the same row close to each other and my phone will not recognize them. Connecting it to my WiFi was not the issue, it was trying to add the camera to the app and where the instructions are unclear.The right size, Local SD Storage and rich in features are all good things but if I can't figure out how to set it up and operate it, what's the point. I am not able to rate Motion detection or night vision because the setup is not going well for me but since it is required field, the three stars I have provided means neutral and do not want to give an undeserving rating, either low or high.",
