                "reviewText": "I'm always looking for improvements and when one of my other cameras died and I needed a replacement, I bought several of these cameras just in case others needed replacing. After seeing the wide field of view and clarity of this camera, I decided to replace a perfectly good Swann camera as well. This camera covers the same area that would've required two cameras several years ago.I love the turret design, it looks and feels like it should cost at least twice the price. The night vision is excellent. Where I used to use an IR illuminator array to help the previous cameras, this camera really lights up the area for several dozen feet. Only the far reaches of my back yard, almost 100ft way, are dark.My only gripe is there is this constant flicker on one of the cameras where it switches between day and night during the daytime every so often . If it wasn't for this issue, this would be an awesome, 5 star camera. I've included a couple videos of the flickering. Because of this flicker, I'm not sure how much I can trust the motion detection.Overall, a very solid camera for a steal of a price. I probably would've only purchased one if the price wasn't right.",
