The quality of sound, and video are some of the best I have used. The movement of the camera is very easy to control via the app and has a very gracious field of view along with a better than average zoom capability and the night vision is slightly above average.Approximately six months after my purchase, one of the cameras would not link up to the app. After a few emails back-and-forth trying to solve the problem, the seller shipped me out a new unit at no cost whatsoever. They even went so far as to expedite the shipping. In this day and age of the non-existence of customer service I was very pleased to find a company that gave me hope for the future. If your reading reviews, that means your like me and want the best product for your buck. This is it.",

                "reviewText": "My favorite company has apparently stopped making outdoor cameras. I needed one for the new shed in my backyard. So after searching, looking, and researching, I came across this one and decided to try it. It wasn't too expensive so I figured I'd return it if it didn't work. I have had negative experiences with little solar panels charging cameras in the past so I didn't set it up with the panel, only the internal battery, which I assumed with my dogs running around, people in the neighboring apartments walking around, and us in the yard, I'd be happy if the battery lasted a week. But I truly didn't expect it to make it past three days. Silly me! It has been a week now (five days) and the camera is still functioning perfectly. The app is telling me the camera is at 100%. I can't believe that, but it is still going so maybe it is. This one has amazed me. I also have a thirty foot micro usb cable that I was going to run through the shed wall to power it, but it has proved to be true to its name: \"Smart battery camera.\" I installed a 128gb samsung SD card. Works great! Weather has not effected it at all. The night vision is better than expected for the price I paid. The app is simple yet highly functional. It was very easy to mount and the solar panel would have been as well. The seals to keep out the moisture are snug and sturdy, not loose and floppy. This thing is sweet! I will be ordering more.I hugjly recommend this to anybody who needs a wireless camera.",

                "reviewText": "We had the problem that so many people have: unable to hardwire exterior cameras. I also don\u2019t like cloud plans and find that the major camera makers are engineered to make money from the cloud (like printer companies with the ink cartridges). So we needed a solar camera system with SD card recording.We bought two of the outdoor solar cameras 5 months ago and are totally impressed with their performance. The VicoHome app is actually very good. It allows you to aim the cameras, change all sorts of settings from motion alerts to recording details, and allows for live view.The best part is the cameras themselves. We don\u2019t live in a super sunny area, but these cameras have never been at less than 99% charge. The quality is really really good, day or night. What\u2019s nice is that the night mode allows you to turn on a light and switch to full color remotely. The settings for default positions are effective.The other funny surprise is that we liked the free trial of the cloud service so much that we continued using it and paying for it. The fee is very reasonable \u2014 $4.49/mo for all (both) cameras. The alerts and cloud playback work so seamlessly and this allows a more solid way to go back in time than reading off the SD card.While we haven\u2019t gotten through winter yet, so far these cameras have proven to be an amazing value. We will likely buy some more of them. If there are any issues over the winter I will update this review.",

                "reviewText": "So we bought 2 of these cameras after 40 people in my rural subdivision had their cars broke in to one night. I was looking for affordable solar powered and took a chance on this camera, was the cheapest or the most expensive but on the middle. It was delivered same day... YAY.So I waited a couple of weeks to write my review so I could have actually been using it for a while and know whether it was worth my money. These cameras exceeded all my expectations and I'm very happy with my purchase.The app set-up was a breeze, out the box was able to start seeing love video of my property.From the app it is very easy to move the camera left right up down , zoom . ..I can even change it to point straight down if some one tried to be clever and get right under it I can still see that. I can clearly make out a face and plates in day time further than said in discription and 20 feet at night maybe more if I had more.lighting outside, but with cameras light alone 15 to 20 feet. . It has a alarm and two way talk feature as well all controllable through the app.I saw complaints of delay when it went to record movement etc. I did have this for about a day, adjusted setting in app and now it records movement from start to end. Other issue maybe it's to far from wifi source and you need a wifi extenders to make it work where you are trying to locate it. We did that for the camera over our shop away from the house where signal was weaker. No issues since.It doesn't record if your watching live, you have to. Manually record at that time otherwise it auto records your preference like cars, people,animals. I had to adjust it so I didn't get a notification everytime some one drove down my street or my dog took off across the yard after a squirrel.The only thing I would like to see is with the app. If my husband signs in on his phone and the I also went to sign in on my own phone it kicks him off. We cannot both be signed it on 2 different devices and viewing or looking through library of saved recording from the night while we were sleeping. I would like for both of us to be able to sign in without one of getting booted out. It's not often we both login at same time, but when we do one of us gets the boot.All in all this a great camera, great picture,features, day night in the rain. App is easy to use and make adjustments,manually record or snap a picture, night vision or night color picture is clear. Definitely better pictures than what you see on the news when they are showing surveillance picture of a suspect they are looking for, this camera actually shows a non grainy clear picture and would make identifying a person easy.I would recommend this camera to anyone looking to monitor their home...or it could even work as a game camera if you had a SD memory card for viewing later or hot spot for live to use where it's at. .",
