                "reviewText": "In case you missed it in the description...its magnetic! I take it to the gym with me to record pics and video while I'm working out. It just sticks right to the Smith Machine or other nearby machine or rack. It does come with a little magnetic swivel mount that you could use as well. The only thing that would make this camera any better is making it WiFi capable paired with a mobile app to view on your phone. You have to plug it into your laptop to view the images/video. P.S. Motion detection is the absolute best option for extending SD space and battery life.",

After spending several hours trying everything I could try to get the camera into the on position as described in the extremely poor set of instuctions ( lots of questionable and confusing series of combined button functions that did not work)...I would strongly suggest avoiding a purchase of this particular camera. Im sending both back to Amazon and going to try another system.",
