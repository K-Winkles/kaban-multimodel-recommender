What Is the Difference Between 5GHz Wi-Fi and 2.4GHz Wi-Fi? 2.4GHz and 5GHz are frequency bands used for wireless LAN communication. 2.4GHz can transmit over long distances, and its signal can spread over a wide range. However, because many wireless LAN devices use this frequency, it is prone to interference and signal congestion. Also, 2.4GHz can be affected by interference from other peripheral devices such as Bluetooth and microwave ovens, which can slow down the connection speed. In contrast, 5GHz provides high-speed communication with less interference, making it less prone to signal congestion. However, 5GHz has a shorter communication range compared to 2.4GHz, and its signal can be weakened by walls or obstacles, resulting in lower transmission speeds. If the 5GHz signal is weak in a certain area, it is recommended to switch to 2.4GHz Wi-Fi. Please note this.",

The lens may become about 50 degree during use.It is only compatible with Android OS, iOS smartphones, or tablets and requires the installation of a free app. As it is a network camera, it is not recommended to be used without Wi-Fi. When the camera is connected to Wi-Fi, it can be remotely monitored through a smartphone.Can only use our app - Srihome. To use the app, registration and login are required. A valid email address must be used as the username during registration. This is necessary to receive an authentication code if you forget or want to change your password. The email address will only be used for registration purposes and no personal information will be sought by the app. For the network camera, failing to allow access to location information may prevent Wi-Fi display and connection. However, the information provided is only an approximate location (at the city or town level) and does not pose any privacy issues.The Srihome app is used to playback videos or view saved videos by removing the SD card and playing them on a computer. You can also download and save videos to your smartphone, but this function is only available for Android devices, as Apple devices do not support it. The video files cannot be deleted, but the SD card can be formatted. Please note that the app does not support double-speed playback.The automatic tracking function only rotates horizontally and not vertically. This monitoring camera is equipped with an advanced AI function that can detect suspicious movements, but it may also have false detections depending on the environment, such as strong winds or reflections from light changes or window glass. Therefore, proper placement and settings are necessary.When rotating the lens, the sound of the motor turning may be heard at a distance of about half a meter. If the camera is placed on a relatively thin wooden table, the sound may become louder due to resonance. There may be some delay in the pan-tilt operation due to the internet speed.This camera does not support cloud storage and a separate SD card would be required to save the videos. If set to continuous recording, videos will be recorded every 10 minutes. If you want to prioritize the detected videos, it is recommended to set up an alert recording that is easier to review.You can manually record while viewing in real-time, with the recorded video saved to the smartphone (Android devices can download, but Apple devices cannot). It is recommended to set up continuous recording or motion detection recording.This surveillance camera is compatible with the ONVIF standard and recording is also possible with NVR devices. However, no NVR device is included and the connection method is not specified in the instruction manual.It can be used by placing it on a stand or by fixing it to a base on the ceiling. The camera and base are fixed with clips and can be easily removed.In full-color night vision mode, the spotlight will light up (red infrared mode is recommended for children's monitoring purposes as it can be dazzling when viewed directly), and in black and white light vision mode, non-dazzling infrared LEDs will light up. The camera is not recommended for use through glass as it may cause reflections in the lighting.This surveillance camera has a zoom function that allows you to pinch two fingers on the smartphone screen to zoom in. However, please note that this is digital zoom and not optical zoom. Therefore, the image quality may deteriorate as the screen becomes larger.When watching in real-time to display images quickly without being affected by the network, the default viewing quality is set to 360P. Although you can change to high-quality, it cannot be saved for real-time viewing.The camera will automatically switch between day and night modes according to the brightness of the environmental lighting. During this transition, a shutter sound may be heard, or the screen color may change. If the illumination changes frequently, the camera needs to switch between modes frequently, but this is normal operation.",

                "reviewText": "I got this to have a controllable camera in the downstairs of our house. The software installs easily and simply scan the QR code on the back of the camera and it loads it. Through the app, you have control to rotate and pivot up/down the camera. You can also speak through the app and it comes out of the camera, wherever you are. The app gives plenty of options, including 24x7 recording with a micro-SD card installed. A 64gb cars seems to hold about 9 days or so of recordings.The recording does so into 10-minute files, each about 60-70mb. The real problem with the files is they are not time stamped to match the camera's time settings. The time stamp IN the videos themselves is correct, but the time stamp of the files as they are saved on the SD card are NOT - they are off by about 8 hours. I can't find a setting to make the files' time stamp match the actual timestamp recorded in the video, so if you have to pull up a video for something, you'll be hunting a bit until you get the correct time range.My only real gripe about it is that it's motion tracking also tracks light changes, so in the living room right now, it constantly wants to point at the Christmas tree and its flickering lights.Overall, however, it seems to be a good little camera.",

WI-FI, 5G, full-color night vision. It has a 2-way talk feature with a built-in microphone and speaker. Set it on a shelf or hang it upside down from the ceiling. When human activity is detected it will be automatically tracked with an alarm sound and video is recorded. The app operates smoothly making it easy to manipulate the device. Just add an SD memory card which is not included. 75-degree tilt and 355-degree pan feature to easily monitor the entire room. Glad I waited because this is the one to buy.",
