A lot of times when I put a camera up I will move it to a different spot because I didn't like the angle. This camera comes with 1 sticky pad(which is extremely sticky) there is no holes for screws, so in order for me to be able to put it on the wall and see if it shows what I want to see I have to use the 1 and only sticky pad to hang the camera on the wall.well I do not see all that I need to and now it is stuck there. Also when we move into our next house how am I supposed to bring it with us? Also the ir option you can't see anything.",

But it's good that you can actually do it I guess. On Iphone the image looks great, no problems.Great little bit of kit.",
