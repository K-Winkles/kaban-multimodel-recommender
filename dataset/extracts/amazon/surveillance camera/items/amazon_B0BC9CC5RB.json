                "reviewText": "The PK320 Smart PTZ Indoor Cam works perfectly for my needs which are for security when I'm not home and monitoring using my android phone. I recently spent a weekend away and it was comforting to see that everything was safe and secure.Two-way audio/voice, Motion tracking, Motion detection, Noise detection and privacy protection are bonus features over the old IP Camera it replaces. Motion detection can be set to low - to minimize alarm notifications, although medium or high sensitivity selections are available if needed. The PTZ controls are a bit touchy, but it didn't take long to get used to using a light touch to fine tune the image adjustments. Because of the wide angle lens, I don't need to often use the PTZ controls. Motion tracking is a nice feature, but in my application it is not needed. The control software allows these options to be turned on or off quickly when desired.You should get a 128G TF-card to allow local storage of snapshots and recorded videos, although an optional cloud service plan is available, which I have not used. Instructions for the TF-Card slot are on the last page of the Mubview PK320 documentation and may be a bit daunting if you are not familiar with installing these small memory cards.I have a closed circuit DVR set-up with external cameras, but this camera provides better privacy control than would adding another camera to that system, and is less expensive. I am completely happy with the camera and think that it is a great value.",

I was expecting to receive a subpar camera as the price is pretty low, but the camera has great quality, easy smart phone assess, easy setup, and great resolution. I have already bought two because of how simple and easy it was to setup and use. The two way talk function is spectacular as I have used it to communicate with both a family member and my pet. It allows me to easily check on both of them in seconds. The human detection and motion tracking features also work exactly as advertised. The app will alert me whenever someone walks in front of the camera and will track the person which lets me feel confident that I won't miss a thing. I would 100% recommend this product for it's low price, but incredible quality!",

                "reviewText": "This is a good camera system for the price and ease of use. I have two of them set up to observe my pets while we are away on vacations or long outings, and they work just fine. Even at night, the picture is still clear enough to see what's going on. This camera does have a motion detection feature, but be aware that it is not a continuous video once motion is detected, but instead a screenshot and a message notifying the user that there has been movement. The picture quality is not like an HDTV, nor would you expect that from a camera system so moderately priced, but the overall quality is still more than good enough to observe what is going on in the area where you have set it up. The speaker system works well, as you can both speak and be heard through it. Once again, it should be noted that this is not an expensive home security system and therefore expectations should not be unreasonable. For the moderate price, you get a good and reliable camera system, and if your needs are simple this will work just fine for you. I am happy with the system and plan to add one more camera. Connectivity to the app, as well as the usability of the overall system, is fairly easy.",

Over the years, we've had incidents where our car has been broken into along with our garage and with this camera, maybe we can get a better idea of what's going on! (Hopefully it doesn't happen again). I love the ease of setup and the app pairs very well with the camera. The camera resolution is excellent, but given that we have set this up on our back window, there is an issue with glare at night - not the camera's fault, we need to figure out how to get this to work better for nighttime. I love that it's portable, so we can move it around or take it to another place to use there (although I'll probably buy a second one for that purpose). I highly recommend this product, you really can't go wrong with it.",
