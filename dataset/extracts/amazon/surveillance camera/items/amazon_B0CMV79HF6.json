Has 3 main modes, detection of radio waves, hidden cameras and a GPS magnetic field. Tested it with my personal PC & laptop with transmission sources, it beeped really loud when I'm in a conference with my headphones on. The infrared light is very bright, guess it would show some sort of reflection if there is indeed a hidden camera. Can't speak for the GPS as I'm not familiar with this.",
