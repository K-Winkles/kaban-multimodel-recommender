                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I was very impressed by the quality and performance of this little unit and especially with the fact that it is waterproof, as we have been having a crazy amount of rain recently and it has not interfered with the camera operation at all. It was quite easy to set up and was fully operational in no time. The camera is 100% wireless, so you can place it in just about any spot where it can stand on its own or you can mount it in a permanent position with the included mounting bracket. It is motion activated and will notify your phone when any motion is detected. There is also a built-in speaker that enables you to address any unwelcome visitors or to greet expected guests. There is a night vision feature and both day and night options have great resolution. There is a built in rolling 3-day storage, but you can also download the videos if you choose. If you need to store a longer timeframe, you can upgrade for just $2.99/mo. and that includes advanced features as well. It charges with a USB cord (included) and the charge can last up to 6 months depending on usage. From my photos you can see that we have temporarily placed it at the edge of our patio trying to catch a glimpse of what ever critter has been chewing on our chair cushions. You can see from the last shot that we now know what we are dealing with! To sum up, we are very pleased with this unit and would highly recommend it to all.",

                "reviewText": "I have tested various cameras, including Ring, and without a doubt, I highly recommend Vision Well. This is a great quality product with a sleek design.Setting up the camera was an absolute breeze, thanks to its user-friendly instructions. In a mere five minutes, I had my device up and running smoothly. And the mobile app is very easy to navigate.The video and picture quality is great. Not only does it capture sharp visuals, but it also excels in low-light conditions. Unlike other recording devices that produce grayscale images, this camera provides colored nighttime footage. Additionally, its motion sensing capabilities are top-notch with accurate detection and reliable performance.One aspect that particularly stands out for me is the versatility in powering the device. This camera has three methods of power including: plug-in, a solar panel setup, or with the built-in battery. This flexibility allows you to place the camera anywhere without worrying about cords or wires.Vision Well is truly a great value, especially considering the rolling free 3-day cloud storage for videos. Additionally, there is an optional subscription-based package available, offering even more features.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using this small camera to monitor my front door for the past three weeks, and I'm delighted with its performance and image quality. The camera can be set to record when it's awake or asleep (in power-saving mode), and it's been able to capture every movement in the area while I've had it active. Even after three weeks, the battery has only decreased by 2%. During the first week, I received constant movement notifications because the camera was always on, and the sensor sensitivity was set to maximum. However, I learned that the sensor is very sensitive and works best at low sensitivity. My favorite feature is the night vision, which allows me to easily recognize who's at the door even in complete darkness from 15 feet away.Although more features are available with a paid subscription, the camera works perfectly fine for what I needed without any additional features. It has decent internal memory for short recordings, even without a memory card. I'm planning on purchasing more cameras for my property in the future!",
