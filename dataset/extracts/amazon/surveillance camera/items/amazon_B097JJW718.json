I have it outdoors for my dogs and the quality is great and so so amazing at night too. Battery has lasted all day and night. During the day it charges using the solar panel. Also it will send like screenshots of alerts (e.g. say somebody is captured on camera).",

Great camera, good picture. The only negative is it's size. This is probably the larges of them all. Remember, this is 90 degree wide angle, so your whole room will be visible.With that said, remember, this is still a chinese cheap usb camera. Not a brand name. What you pay is what you get.
