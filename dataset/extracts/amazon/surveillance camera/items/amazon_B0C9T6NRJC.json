It allows me to control the camera's view remotely, ensuring I can monitor different areas of my home with ease.This is particularly handy when I'm cooking in the kitchen and want to keep an eye on what's happening in the living room.The video quality is sharp, and the night vision feature works exceptionally well, providing clear footage even in low-light conditions. I appreciate the reliability and security this camera offers.Overall, the Cloarks wireless pan-tilt IP camera is a fantastic addition to my home security setup.

                "reviewText": "I bought these cameras to replace some 1080p cameras I purchased few years ago. These 2k cameras put them to shame. They are roughly the size is a soda can. Very discreet and packed with great features . The clarity and focus of these is superior. Almost view in real-time . Same for the night vision . The two way communication is even pretty good .Very plug and play easy to install. I would recommend mounting them upside down for best field of view. Better range of motion. All the mounting hardware is included. Although I would recommend using the L Shaped - Floating shelves. They are wireless units. But the power cable are is the standard size about 3-1/2 feet. If your outlet is further from the camera. You\u2019ll need the 6 ft type C cables. They\u2019re controlled by Phone app. So you can check on your home / loved ones with ease. I would definitely recommend these to anyone.",

                "reviewText": "Hi Y'all! My NEW job as a Live-In Caregiver have cameras installed all over the home, No Prob, I Didn't Care About That. Watch me because I'm NOT gonna do ANY HARM or STEAL ANYTHING! My space was on the 2nd floor apt where it is illegal to view & film. Of course they relocated the cameras that I could see but they had fake smoke detector cameras also. The week before I discovered the fake ones I had purchased this wonderful little Camera by Cloarks. I posted a sign on my bedroom door, which was 1/4 of the 2nd floor. Installed MY Cloarks brand camera and now I was able to catch them in their lie about being in MY personal space. I immediately packed my belongings and moved out. This Cloarks camera is small, very quiet, accurate, super easy to setup, clear footage, Great Value, super pan/tilt function, COLOR Night Vision, motion detection, 2 way audio, multi-user sharing, super instant alerts. 85% 5 Star Reviews. I think Cloaks' Security Camera has everything that is needed for indoor security. WOW! I LOVE THIS CAMERA! Thank You Cloaks!",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Wi-Fi security camera with great quality video and images, and I must say it's been a game-changer for my home security setup. This camera allows me to access a live view of anything I care about or recorded video from anywhere, providing peace of mind monitoring my home. One of the standout features is its exceptional night vision capability, ensuring super clear visuals even in low light conditions. The wide video coverage of the area I wish to monitor is impressive, and I appreciate the continuous 24/7 protection it offers. What sets this camera apart is its user-friendly nature. I easily integrated it into my existing VicoHome app, where I already had two other cameras set up. Adding this camera to my network was a breeze, and it has significantly improved my coverage area, giving me a comprehensive view of my surroundings. The ability to share access with multiple users is a handy feature, as it allows my family members to stay connected and keep an eye on our home. The camera's 2K video quality ensures that the images are crystal clear, and the pan/tilt function allows me to adjust the camera's position remotely, ensuring I never miss a thing. Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with this security camera. Its high-quality video, night vision, and seamless integration into my existing setup have made it an indispensable part of my home security system. It provides the peace of mind I was looking for, and I highly recommend it to anyone in need of reliable 24/7 protection.",

                "reviewText": "The power cord is VERY short! Really, 3 feet... Guys, you know people will be placing the cam on the shelves or mounting it somewhere higher than the floor level. You really could provide a longer power cord, at least 6ft would be a good start.The field-of-view is not as wide compared to Wyze's 120\u00b0. maybe it gets 100\u00b0, couldn't find info on this.The bottom tilt doesn't go far enough but the problem is solved if you can mount the cam upside down then you can see straight down the feet.Overall I am happy with the camera:- 2K image quality, which is much better compared to Wyze's 1080.- Good features.- Easy to connect.",
