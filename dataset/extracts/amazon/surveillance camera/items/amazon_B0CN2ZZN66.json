I expect a good battery life to be good for what it does. It uses the CloudEdge app and was super easy to add a camera with the QR code. I have several Jennov products and the support and product's are top notch. Jennov does need to commit to using one app for all their product's.",

Unfortunately,it does not send motion alerts to Alexa. Hopefully, Jennov will addAlexa motion alerts to this and their other cameras / apps in the near future.I have a couple of different Jennov cameras and they all have metmy expectations and work better than most of the other brand cameras Ihave used.At the current price point, I would highly recommend / purchase again.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first security camera, so I do not have anything to compare it with. Set up was easy after installing the app on my phone. The only time when I had a little bit of trouble was when my wife also installed the app so that she could also monitor camera activity. For her phone to sync with the camera she had to reset the camera, but that meant that my phone was no longer connected to the camera. If I then wanted my phone connected to the camera I had to reset it, and now her phone no longer recognized the camera. Eventually we discovered a \"Device Share\" section in the app settings that allowed both of us to connect our phones to the camera. One of the phones appears to act as the primary device for the camera and that phone can invite other phones to join, given them permission to only view images, or to have 'almost' full control over the camera (it appears that the only functionality missing in the secondary phone is the ability to invite other phones to share the camera).After we passed that sharing hiccup everything else has gone well with the camera. The image quality is excellent, even at night. We chose the setting where night vision is mostly black and white but it switches to color when motion is detected (the other choices are B&W all the time or color vision all the time). I was concerned about the strength of our WiFi signal at the location where we wanted to install the camera, but everything went well (indicating both that our router provides a strong enough signal and that the camera has a strong enough sensor to detect the signal).We installed a 128GB SD card to record video. The cloud service seems like an interesting option, and it is reasonably priced, but unfortunately they only accept payment from Google Pay or PayPal, none of which I use. If sometime in the future they decide to take credit cards I may subscribe.The only question remaining in my mind concerns battery life. The specs say that it lasts six months in standby, but with normal use I suspect that it will last a lot less than that. I placed the camera by my front door, and even though I live on a quiet street I expect that recording will be triggered dozens of time per day (kids walking to school, people walking their dogs, etc.). I hope that the battery lasts at least a month before it needs to be recharged, but in any case I intend to get a solar panel that can be connected to the camera through the USB-C charging port.",

                "reviewText": "It's nice and small (and mostly white) so you can easily mount this on the side of your light colored house and probably not see it from the street. I don't like people seeing big ugly cameras on my house, I want the security but I don't want to advertise that I use cameras. It uses the Cloudedge app. I have a few other cameras that use that software also. The software is not the best, but I deal with it...and at least this camera uses the same as some others I have. I'm not sure on the wireless range but it works outside my house. Battery life will depend on how often it gets triggered to turn on, so remember that and check your motion settings to best suit your needs. I have not been able to use it enough to notice a battery drain. It would be real cool to hook up a solar panel to it as the directions state and then not have to worry about a low battery. Picture quality is about the same as other cameras in this price range.",
