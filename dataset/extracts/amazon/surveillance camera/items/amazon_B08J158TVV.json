                "reviewText": "If you just need something to keep an eye on your home or around the house, this is for you. I was able to set it up right away with my wireless internet. You control it with an app on your phone. It has both a microphone and a speaker, so you can listen for sounds and also speak through the camera itself. That's pretty crazy. It has Night vision, intelligent tracking, motion detection, recording, photos and videos, an alarm system, so many features. SD card support too! You can download what it saves straight to your phone as well as save video length. You can also set up push notifications for motion detection and intelligent tracking. All of this so far is well worth what it costs.There's really only a couple of downsides. The video and picture quality isn't spectacular. There isn't much zoom at all.It is powered by plug-in only. They (Boavision) DO make an extra-long extension. I had to get it. I also recommend taping the connections just to be safe.There are no batteries.I did try using this with a small solar panel, but it wasn't strong enough to keep it going at night. You really gotta use the plugin.Intelligent tracking can get a bit too responsive even at the lowest setting; wind really interferes with what it recognizes. I had it set up for push notifications but turned them off on my first windy day. It is not terrible though: I live around a lot of trees, so it's more of a me problem.Even after all this I'm still learning new things that I can do with it.If you're looking for a cheap effective camera that works to just keep a check on your home or any area really, I can recommend this one. For the price it is such a great deal. You can also have more than one going at one time. I've been considering getting a second one for a different place at my home.",

                "reviewText": "I am very experienced with installing and using IP cameras. I bought this camera to fill a specific need for WiFi - all of my other cameras are hard-wired with Cat6 POE. The first one of these that I received would not connect to my network; Amazon support sent me a replacement which worked immediately, and I'm pretty impressed by its capabilities for a $50 Pan/Tilt WiFi camera.Note: this is my review of the new camera. My original review is later in this post.I bought this camera for a specific purpose: to create a portable WiFi camera that I can place anywhere on my property and run with battery power with no wiring connections at all. Why? Sometimes I want to place a camera temporarily in a location where it is not possible or practical to run network cables.One application for this camera is to monitor water flow in a culvert about 100ft downhill from my house. During heavy rain, the culvert becomes a raging torrent. I've always wanted a way to monitor it during heavy storms and especially at night. With this portable camera setup, I can now do that.Sometimes I want a temporary camera to monitor HVAC contractors working in the attic. One contractor sabotaged my A/C unit and then tried to sell me a new one.I suspect that chipmunks are climbing the downspouts on my house and running around the gutters to get to other sides of the house. Now I can check and see. ;-)I'm sure I'll think of other uses now that I have it available.Here's what I like about it:Very small and lightweight for a Pan/Tilt camera - easy to strap to a treeVery sharp video. Only 1080P so digital zoom is of no use, but for $50, it meets my needs.Reasonably fast, accurate (stops quickly), and wide-range Pan and TiltExcellent IR and bright white LED nighttime illumination.Draws very little power (about 140ma in the daytime)Very good WiFi range (about 80-100ft outdoors on my property)Has ONVIF support, so I can quickly connect it to my Blue Iris network and control it just like my other cameras.To clarify/correct some information I found in other reviews:This camera DOES support ONVIF. I have it connected to Blue Iris with no issuesThis camera DOES support Static IP address, but it is labled as Fixed IP Address in Network SettingsThis camera DOES work with Blue Iris. Probably also with most or all software that supports ONVIFOriginal review of first (not working) camera follows -------------------------------------------------------------I found the instructions somewhat hard to follow and the print size to be way too small for an old guy like me to read but I found a YouTube video that goes through the process step-by-step (but you have to continually pause it to see each step.)After much experimentation, both with WiFi and cable, I could not get the camera IP address to show up. I even set up a totally separate WiFi router to eliminate possible conflicts with the many cameras and other devices on my main network. The IP address would not show up even on the simplified network. When plugged into the router, the green LED on the socket of the camera cable glows solid green, but the LED for the corresponding port on the router was not blinking.I called the Amazon tech support number listed on the purchase record. A tech called back quickly, but it was obvious that he was reading suggestions from the camera user manual. He was systematic and polite, but I could tell we were not going to solve the problem. He offered to send a replacement camera, which I accepted.The new camera arrived in less than 24 hrs (Prime). Two thumbs up for that. I decided to go straight to a hardwired test since that usually is less prone to trouble than WiFi. Using the same simplified network with just a WiFi-connected laptop and no other devices on the network, within a minute I could see the camera's IP address and connect to it using the IP address and Chrome. That's as far as I've gotten, but the many configuration options and image clarity look promising. I'll file a new report after more testing.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased a bunch (8) of these cameras. One died after 1 mo. The rest keep dropping offline requiring a constant reboot.I have a mesh router system that covers 7000sf. My needed coverage area is 1500sf. I also have gigabit Internet with 2.4 channel running 120 mbps on the slow side. Most of the time it's over 200.I had wired cameras that went bad after 10 years and decided to try wifi and spend less, big mistake. One of the cameras was replaced by the manufacturer about 5 months ago. It's now starting to mess up again. Won't connect I have to keep rebooting. And the preset position (after reboot) keeps failing.If you can afford to spend more on a cameras do it. Looks like I made a mistake.I just checked one of my other cameras and preset was on but not correct. I pressed the preset number and nothing, camera did not move back to programed point. I then tried the manual tilt buttons, nothing. Then I closed the camera view and opened it again and the position was now correct.So, it looks like the android app is not working correctly. Company needs to update and correct the app and add a windows app.It just gets worse.Update 2/24/24 another camera goes to the garbage can. Shows on line but keeps buffing. View opened once and camera won't move.",
