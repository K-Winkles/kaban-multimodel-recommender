I've had two fail due to corrosion on the RJ45 jack. The wires inside the cable sheath appear smaller than they should be (for cat5e) and also appear to be aluminum instead of copper. I happen to own a soldering iron and had cat5e splicers that i removed the wire knifes/punch downs from and then soldered the cameras wires on side and cat 6 on the other to restore the failed camera. This is probably beyond what most people are willing or able to do though.",
