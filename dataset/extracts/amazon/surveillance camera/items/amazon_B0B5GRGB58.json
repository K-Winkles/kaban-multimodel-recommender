                "reviewText": "This camera has very good video picture quality. I have not used it outside yet. I have it set up in the kitchen with a plan to find out which of my dogs counter surf for food. The speaker, if you want to send voice to the camera, is nice and loud, as well, in case you want to scold your furry friends. So far, it has just caught us wandering in and out of the kitchen. The motion detection is very good because I have over 100 video captures.The setup was very easy and I like the user interface. It's easy to review your captures and delete them on your phone. So far, the only nitpicky gripe I might have is that the button controls and charging port, which are protected on the underside by a nice weatherproof rubber cover, can be tough to access with the mount attached. It's much easier to remove the camera from the mount first, which you'd do if you have it mounted outside and need to bring it inside to charge. Again...so minor.Overall, this is a very capable web-connected camera with good quality video and audio that sends timely alerts to your phone.",

                "reviewText": "This camera is a great price and it works great. I'm always skeptical, but this is a great camera. It's easy to set up, but be aware that it will require drilling. The video is clear, even in night mode. If the camera detects motion, you can get notifications sent to your phone, which is really awesome. Personally, this is one of my favorite features. I didn't get to try the speaker function because I didn't have any visitors during the trial, but I have no reason to doubt it's functionality.I definitely recommend this camera, I've found nothing to write negatively about and it is doing its job flawlessly.",

                "reviewText": "Ok so I am new to the remote security camera world. I bought this to try out and learn about them. The pros- It is a usb-c rechargeable battery and it last a really long time between charges its been running almost a month and still has 38 percent battery charge left.. Battery level at a glance. Fairly easy to setup. Very clear even at night and it is very sensitive to motion.Cons- they dont tell you that after the 30 day free trial you have to subscribe to get motion alerts and really anything you bought it for. Also they dont tell you in the ad that if you use the sd card that it MUST be a name brand and you cannot use a off brand(inexpensive) card. I tried not knowing until after I purchased the camera and it wont fully format the sd card.So overall I am happy with it. I just wish the ads for these things told you everything up front and what to expect but I could have done more research so it is what it is. I would recommend it if it fits your needs.",

                "reviewText": "I have several cameras from a different brand but I decided to give this one a try. It was easy to setup and easy to use. Out of curiosity, I decided to just charge it and only use battery power instead of keeping it plug i in and I discovered it seems to have a really long battery life. At its current rate, I think it will hold a charge for about 5-6 weeks.It really does give a pretty good detailed live video feed and recordings. You can see everything you want to see including the night vision. The app is pretty easy to use and there are several options. What I liked about this camera over my other ones is the bracket is nicer for hanging it anywhere and then easily adjustable movement so you can have it in the exact position you want. Also, the automatic saving of recent recordings on the cloud is nice. My other service only keeps recordings up to a couple of weeks. This service seems to go by how much memory is stored and seems like it might give me a little more flexibility of time if I want.The one thing that is not quit to my liking is when you open the app, the live feed doesn\u2019t automatically come on until you touch a play button. Some people might like this because you wouldn\u2019t get a lag until you actually want to see the feed and so you could get to settings and options faster. But myself, if I open the app, I want to see the feed right away. I wish there was an option to change whether it came up instantly or to wait until you press the play button. They also did an app update that now constantly gives you suggestions when you start the live feed that I find annoying. I wish the suggestions could be turned off. But there are things on my other cameras I find annoying so I guess I am just picky.I would recommend this camera if you are looking for something easy to use with a good picture for a decent price.",
