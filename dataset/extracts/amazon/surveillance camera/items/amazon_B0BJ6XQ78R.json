In fact check the photo out in my review I just snapped that with the app and that's how crystal clear my front yard looks at night. I have several cameras around the house that all have a similar HD crisp clear quality. I have less issues and less lag time and buffering with these cameras than my expensive Vivint cameras. These are also easy to install. First out of the box don't do anything but charge it up for about 3 or 4 hours. Then have the app all set up open up the app and get to the section where you want to add a device. Hold the power on the camera down for a long press and you'll hear a beep and some other things while the camera connects up to the app. Do all that on your couch or while you're laying in your bed so you don't have to be stressed out outside trying to put the camera up while you're turning it on. The screws are sharp enough if you have a little bit of muscle you can take a Phillips and the screw and just muscle it into the wood of course I'm talking about the camera attachment receptacle not the camera itself. If you have to put the camera upside down no problem because on the app you have a thing that you can do to rotate it I believe it's a button that you just click and I will rotate the camera in the right direction for you. For the small amount of money these are it's amazing how long the battery lasts. My first camera battery seems to be better than the second one I charged it up last October and it still has 30% left battery. I don't know how I can last from October until February and still have 30% remaining but it does. I guess I got lucky. My second camera I put up at the beginning of January and it's already at 50% after 1 month so although that's still very good it's not as good as my original first camera.",

                "reviewText": "These cameras are great!!!! I bought two in March 2023 to be able to check in on an injured family member receiving PT, while I was away from the house. I was looking for a camera that i did not have to have a subscription for, had good battery life (2 mos. life) and didn\u2019t cost an arm and a leg. I think this one meets those requirements and more. The clarity is excellent as well as the audio and video. Being able to listen in, speak to and take stills are a nice extra. It has a pretty wide viewing range and setup (app/software/camera) is pretty darn easy too. Make sure you read compatibility requirements as it does NOT work with 5G wi-fi. Night vision works well also. I just bought another to put outside so I can\u2019t speak to how it will perform in the Mid-Atlantic weather. The camera is picking up Wi-if outside at about 35-40 ft from the router inside. With all that said here are the few things that I\u2019ve noticed that would improve the unit. The camera tips over when attached to the perch, if the perch is not attached to the surface. So1- the camera is a little top heavy when tilted. I did not want to put any holes in my surface to attach so I tried heavy duty two sided tape instead of screws, didn\u2019t work. So maybe a heavier or wider base would compensate for the the weight of the camera. The perch\u2019s are pretty solid and hold the tilt/position of the camera pretty well. I currently have one w/the perch sitting straight up on a table top and the other w/out the perch sitting on top of a candlestick.2- I have not explored this to see if there\u2019s a way to correct but the camera doesn\u2019t orient to right side up if you want to have it \u201changing\u201d from its perch so viewing is upside down if hanging the camera vs standing it.Other than those two functionality comments, I think it\u2019s a terrific camera and would recommend to anyone.",

Works amazing as an added extra layer of security. Gives you a subtle alarm, which can be adjusted, ever time it detects motion. Highly recommend if your looking for something inexpensive for security",

There is no viable customer care involved with this system.Please go to the Play Store, sort reviews by newest and read the failures of the system from actual buyers. Go elsewhere for your security camera. This is not a security camera as it is advertised to be. 20 second videos only. 1 minute reset. No way to add users. They press you to join their cloud services only to be able to tape a 20nsecond or 10 seconds video. This is really a mess for $70 worth of camera and no way to get support nor return them. After 3 months they are useless.Please be aware the only way to purchase a plan is via Google pay which is a non-starter. It should not have to be anything Google related to connect to this camera and it should be noted in the description so that a customer is informed before the purchase. 12/4/23-TRASH. The cameras have started to miss motion right in front of it less than 20ft away from home. Support is non-existent in app store. There is no way to add payment methods other than Google Pay. No developer responses in app store for assistance. The cameras have stopped picking up security events so now it's a camera ONLY. There is no security involved when I needed to report an event to police. My camera fired but the event had passed. This is a recurring thing since we haven't subscribed to their monitoring service via Google Pay. The only response we got was about the money portion. We do not find that these perform as advertised. I feel they are trying to force their plan in order for them to be fully effective security cameras but don't bite. The plan doesn't provide any more features just cloud storage ONLY. Thank you.",
