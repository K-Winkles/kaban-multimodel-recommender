                "reviewText": "worst purchase ever.focusing on the camera, they fit right in my light bulb socket. great, love it. cameras are on good full strength wifi and always disconnect. reconnecting or resetting the device on the cameras as well as in the app is unclear. the cameras are offline in the app more than they are online. I might as well not have cameras.You can't play more than a 6 second video without a monthly fee. The 360 rotation only works if you move it by hand in the app. It doesn't pick up movement until 2 minutes after movement occured.My biggest pet peeve would be that I can't access the cameras 90% of the time because they say they're offline. Another frustrating thing is there's no power button on the cameras. The only way they turn on is if they're screwed into a light socket. Cameras only have one reset button other than that it is unclear how to reboost the cameras to actually be able to see footage. Cameras came with very little instructions in English.If you read reviews before you buy it, I would not recommend this to my closest friend or my worst enemy. it's supposed to be easy but it's frustrating. Not to mention, th footage I need I can't get because their offline.",

                "reviewText": "I had to replace one of my home security cameras and instead of going with my normal brand, I decided to try this brand. Installation was no different than I am used to and was fairly smooth. When I fired it up and was doing my final adjustments, I was using my phone app to verify aiming and the picture seemed weird, but I assumed it was my app. I went inside to view it on my console and noticed that the camera had a \"fish-eye\" type display, so I assumed it was the mode I had the camera in. I changed modes and it did not change. It's not a huge deal, but being this camera is looking at my backyard which has a slight hill, it really distorts the view making it look really steep. It took some getting used to, but it works and is still going strong. Other than the view, it seems to be a decent-quality camera. Wouldn't necessarily recommend it to my friends or family.",
