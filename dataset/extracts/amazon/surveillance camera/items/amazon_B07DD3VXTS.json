It only works with 2G not 5G internet but I have both options on my iPhone so mine works just fine. The night vision is excellent and you can even talk to people in your home when your away and they can talk back to you (has very small speaker and is not very loud). You can use your phones storage or pay for a monthly cloud package (starts at around $5.95 per month & goes up). I have mine on 24 hour recording but for some reason you will get loud noise feedback/screeching if your phone volume is to loud. I have had mine for months and have no complaints. The only issue is getting used to turning on the camera through the app before you leave. You will need to download the free app before you can use it.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I ordered a different camera last week(cheap, mini spy cam) and got exactly what I paid for, cheap product. Spent almost three hours trying to get it to connect to the app on my phone(which had a less than 2 star rating) so I gave up and returned it and bought this camera! It was only $12 more expensive than the other one but man! I should have bought two cause I love this thing so much! I just needed something small to put outside my hermit crab tank so I could watch them when I wasn\u2019t home while they were out and about and this works just great!Set up took less than 10 minutes. Downloaded the app, connected the camera and got it positioned all in under ten minutes. The picture quality is good, the night vision is good.The only thing I\u2019ve noticed is that when you turn on the lights, if the camera is in any way tucked behind something or close to something else that blocks the infrared light, the night vision doesn\u2019t switch back to normal automatically. You almost have to show the camera to the light before it registers it. But all in all, it\u2019s a wonderful little device! I like that you don\u2019t have to pay for storage if you don\u2019t want it. This first one is just a tank monitoring camera for me so I don\u2019t really need any storage because it\u2019s not for security purposes and I like that I don\u2019t have to pay simply to view my camera. It does come with a memory card feature that seems to be viewable from the app as well.That being said, the options for the cloud service that it DOES give you are very reasonably priced. $20 for an entire year with a 14 day continuous recording time is almost unbeatable! Very happy with this purchase and I am going to be buying more from this company! For reference, I pay $50 a month for my Vivint service and it\u2019s not that great! Lol!",

                "reviewText": "Motion alert works like a charm. Noise detection doesn't work worth beans. Even though the mic works just fine. The image quality is fairly good. It's as good as 1080p gets with such low Bitrate. Fair trade for efficient memory size I suppose. The night vision is outstanding. Although I wish there were a way to use night vision without the red light coming on. Compromises the cameras location if your trying to keep hidden for recording evidence. I.e. I'm currently trying to catch whomever has been breaking into my pickup at night. I've attached the camera under the roof of my garage, facing towards the driveway. But that red light sticks out like a sore thumb in front of the garage. I'm afraid they'll see it before it sees them and I'll never get my evidence. You can use \"hey google, stream my camera onto my tv!\" and it'll cast live to your smart tv. But there is a 15-18 second delay. So whatever you see that's concerning... It's not happening now, it already happened and your half a minute late and 2 steps behind. So i recommend you stick to the geeni app for viewing the feed.I've hardly broken mine in so we'll see in a few months if i have to come back here and change this review. Otherwise assume this is a great product for its price and buy it.",

                "reviewText": "We were looking for an affordable security camera system that provides us with an easy to deploy, excellent picture and video quality. We found that and much more on the Geeni Look. The Geeni look 2 pack comes with two Wi-Fi capable cameras, this made the Geeni Look 2 pack a perfect match for us.The Geeni Look comes with an easy to follow setup instructions. Everything that will need to be done to configure the Cameras is done through the Geeni App. The only problem that we encountered during the setup process was that the App could not find the cameras via Wi-Fi, however the instruction provides an option to add the cameras to the App using QR barcode that the Geeni App generates and the camera that is been add will be able to read without any problem.The video quality is astonished. The camera can stream in SD (Standard Definition) or HD (High Definition). The camera is streaming all the time, however in order to record the video you will have to buy an micro-SD card so the video can be stored in it without having to pay extra by cloud storage. The Geeni Look cameras support up to 128GB micro-SD card. I would like to inform that the camera will start saving the video into the SD-card right after the micro-SD card is installed. Please keep in mind that the SD-Card memory information will not populate until after some time of the card been used by the camera.This camera only have a 120 degree view which makes them a challenge to cover a great area indoor. However, for our case the 120 degree view was more than sufficient.Our las point about this amazing cameras is that many people complained about the audio that the camera is able to capture, but we did not find any issue when it came to audio.Overall, we really recommend the Geeni Look as you will get a great value for your money, great night vision and great motion detection.",
