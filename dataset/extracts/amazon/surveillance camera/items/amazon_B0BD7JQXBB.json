I also have the solar panel plugged up so the battery is either that good or they work great together. This would be great for camping ect.. I would definitely recommend.

                "reviewText": "This is the 2nd one of these cameras I have purchased. I use them to monitor my property that doesn't have wifi or electricity and they work perfectly for that! The app is easy to use and getting them up and running is quick and painless. Motion detection works very good but not overly sensitive to small disturbances like leaves/bugs /rain(the smallest thing I've had set it off was a house cat). I like using the cloud bc you can see what triggered the camera to record. Otherwise you would have to pull the SD card every time to see the recorded videos. It's a small fee after the 30 day free trail but well worth it in my opinion. The microphone and audio work pretty good you can clearly hear what I'm saying on it from 30ft away or more. So if you need to talk to someone thru it( like a delivery driver) it's very easy to do. Picture quality is good especially on HD. The night vision is also very clear even on IR mode which is what I use bc I don't want the bright white light coming on giving away the cameras location. All these features are changed thru the app no need to physically be at the camera. The solar charging works good my one camera only gets about 3 hrs of direct sunlight a day and it has never gotten low. It charges even when light is dim or it's raining. These cameras have given me peace of mind that my property is safe and alert me when someone is there. Very glad I bought them!",

                "reviewText": "This is a honest review of the product. My first camera was defective as it would not charge with the provided solar panel. It took me a while to figure this out as the battery power consuption was very good so I couldn't easily tell whether it was not charging or perhaps it wasn't receiving enough sun light. The replacement camera came quickly, next day or two after reporting. The image quality was descent but felt a ted bit inferior in comparison to the defective unit i returned. There are a dozen or more competitor cameras whose feature set and software, all the way the way to the setup are the same. In fact, my prior competitor brand was Siliom which was priced much higher and didn't come with a memory card. I thought I would gives these guys a shot as they were priced at least 25% cheaper and came with a memory card. The pan and tilt on this camera was much more responsive than the siliom camera. However, the down fall on both these cameras are the motion detection. It seems to be detecting beyond it's range and even on the lowest settings I am picking up a lot of false alarms. Grass and tree movements are being picked up. I wish we could define the motion detection zones, I believe this would seriously reduce the false detection. I don't think those antennas are any good because my cell would pick up an extra bar than the cameras. I initially used a tmobile card and the signal was very poor in my area that caused my battery to drain fast when it has trouble connecting. Switching over the triple band card provided was better and didn't drain as much. So the down side of the elliot triple band card provided is that it is tied to a higher monthly fee and you get more data for the higher fee. The problem it is a lot more data than i need but you won't be able to get a cheaper plan even though there exists cheaper plans from Elliot club. You would have to buy a different card from Elliot here on amazon where you would be able to get plans for almost half the price. You can also get data plans for tmobile for $5.99 a month for 500MB of high speed after which they will trottle you. The only down side with the tmobile plan is that you are the $35 activation fee for the line. I have the camera for a short time now, so far it has served it's purpose, just wished the motion detection was more usable. Other than that, it is a great camera for the price point.",
