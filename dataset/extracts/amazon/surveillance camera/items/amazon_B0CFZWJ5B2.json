Happened to see this Wesecuu light bulb security camera for around twenty bucks (ok, thirty bucks, because I had to buy a SD card) on Amazon, thought I give it a try. This security camera looks like a light bulb, just had to screw it into an existing light fixture after easy setup, and that\u2019s it! So, great price, easy setup, super clear video (day & night), 360 degree of motion tracking, continuous recording with sd card, it\u2019s the best security camera I\u2019ve found for the price, so happy with it, I purchased another for the side yard!",

I\u2019ve tried every setting possible but it still takes us standing under it waving our arms for several seconds before the light and siren kicks on. Apart from that, it was easy to set up and everything else about it is acceptable for the price. The picture quality is clear enough, the light is bright enough, and the night vision works just fine.",

Very maneuverable and super easy to check the areas I have covered.I didn\u2019t rate them higher because they lose connectivity every time I\u2019m not actively using them, and it takes minutes to reconnect. Not sure if my internet is the problem, but it\u2019s not good.The other issue is the SD cards. I bought and installed them, and I can see past events, but only a single image for each. If I try to see a video, I get a message that no video is available.Maybe I\u2019m missing something?",

                "reviewText": "I'm so pleased with the WESECUU Light Bulb Security Camera! Setup was a snap! It operates off the power of my front porch light socket (How cool is that!), and the app is great! I can scan the entire street along my front yard and see my garbage cart and mailbox. No more wondering if trash has been emptied or mail delivered. I can easily point it down to my porch and front door to see packages, visitors, etc. If I lose my WiFi signal, it reconnects immediately once service is restored. I plan to replace my awful back deck camera (described below) with the WESECUU solar powered model so I can use the same app. I absolutely recommend this brand!I'm new to security cameras, and my first experience was very disappointing. I purchased (from a home improvement store) a stationary, solar powered camera for my back deck and driveway. There's no light socket or power outlet available, and I prefer solar power to battery packs that have to be removed to charge. It only works so-so, and if it disconnects from my WiFi it takes a LOT of work to reconnect. At one point, I almost threw it away! And, the app is AWFUL! It also cost me several times more than this one, and three times more than the WESECUU solar powered!",
