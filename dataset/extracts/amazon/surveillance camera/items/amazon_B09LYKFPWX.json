                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. After a full month of use, I'm very impressed with this camera and the app that goes with it. Dzees is a brand related to Zumimall, and I already own 3 outdoor cameras from Zumimall. The quality and price were outstanding so I thought I would try this new model. Out of the box, I could tell this has a quality build by appearance and weight. I made an unboxing video, but you can only upload 1 video per review and I thought the notification / app launch video provided more value. To summarize what I omitted, you get everything you need to charge and install the camera. No surprises.Installation was simple and provides plenty of versatility, see the photo of how I have mine positioned. The picture quality is very good, though mine is poised to capture events at 15+ ft.My favorite and least favorite thing here is the app. The Dzees app has more advanced functionality than the CloudEdge app that I use for my other wireless WiFi cameras. Both are easy to use, but the Dzees app allows you to set up Activity Zones, on par with other high-end motion cameras. This flexibility is great because at first, the camera kept thinking that my neighbor's mailbox was a person, so I was getting a lot of alerts :D I simply set up the Activity Zone around the mailbox and it's been smooth sailing. The app loads very quickly and the time from event, to notification, to viewing the event is about 10sec which is really pretty awesome. I attached a video of how quickly the event video loads once you tap the notification and my phone is 5 years old. This is the type of thing that user's care about, so I'm glad Dzees/Zumimall made this snappy.The only drawback is also the app. And this only applies if you've bought multiple cameras from Zumimall, like me. This is a separate app and it would be fantastic to have all my cameras from the same company in the same app. There is even an additional Zumimall app, making there 3 total app for outdoor cameras from the same company. All of them are really solid though, with intuitive UIs and great features.To utilize the AI Analysis available and the Activity Zones in the app you need a subscription. This also allows you to get longer cloud storage and it will identify people, vehicles and pets, which is pretty cool. I don't recall the price, but it was a few dollars / month and they have different tiers available.The battery lasted about a month on the initial charge, though I expect it to last twice as a long in the future given my current battery levels. I think this is related to all of the 'mailbox alerts' I was getting before fine-tuning my setup.Overall, I'm very happy with this camera and I would highly recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "I bought 3 of these cameras and so far, they have exceeded my expectations for a camera at this price range. The motion detection, audio quality, video quality, features such as spotlight and siren, and battery life have so far been great. I like the fact that these cameras can be standalone cameras without the need of another home base module, reducing the complexity of installation and operation. I've had two cameras for a good 3 months now, and they still operate and record smoothly.In addition, I got a 3rd camera about two weeks ago since I was happy with my 2 original ones. I charged this third one to 100% before installing it outdoors. For about 4-5 days, it recorded a lot of clips due to the location and the amount of movement in the area. I would say it recorded about 30-40 clips a day with an average duration of 30 seconds each. After about 5 days, battery dropped to 95%, which was very decent. I got a solar panel as pictured and installed it when the camera was 95%. In a matter of hours (camera was installed late night, and I checked battery life next day at 3pm), the camera was charged to 100%. I was really surprised that the solar panel charged so well in. spite of the camera usage. It's been almost one week, and with the same regular recording frequency and use, the camera is still at 100%. It's still fairly early to tell the longevity of the panel and how long it can perform this way, but I have to say that the panel and camera are working very well together. I think this is well worth it especially since I don't need to charge the camera as it's fine so far stand-alone with the solar panel. I've read it should decrease the frequency of having to charge, so I'm very surprised that I haven't had to charge it at all since it's at 100%.Having stated all the positives, the only one thing I wish could be improved is the motion detection. It seems that motion detection is very sensitive. When I first left it at \"High\" (default setting), it was recording constantly even when a tree branch moved slightly. I had to adjust it to Medium and it was still a little sensitive, but much better than before. It wasn't until the Activity Zone feature was enabled that I cropped out the tree and everything worked as I wanted. Now there aren't any \"false\" motion recordings.All in all, these are great cameras and I highly recommend them, especially with the solar panel to keep them charged up.",

                "reviewTitle": "Camera giving quality pictures and ensuring securities",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I installed this outdoor security camera in my backyard. On the second day after my installation of the camera a first suspicious motion that the camera caught in my backyard is a squirrel. As shown in the attached video clip the video taken was pretty clear under a dark raining weather condition. Among the security cameras (both battery and hardwired powered) that I have used this security camera had an impressive performance, which is elaborated as follows.1. Due to its purely wire-free specialty, installation of the camera is extremely easy (mainly fixing the bracket with a few screws) and the place where the camera is installed is very flexible. For instance, I installed the camera on a pillar of my backyard fence.2. In addition to an adjustable bracket, on which the camera needs to be screwed, in the original camera package, a magnetic bracket, for which the camera can be fixed with magnetic force, is also included. I found the magnetic bracket is more convenient than the screwed bracket for the camera to be put on/off the bracket (for instance when need to charge the camera inside). After a particular test of the magnetic bracket, you are assured that magnetic attachment with the bracket is strong enough to fasten the camera that can face upward, or downward, and left or right directions.3. With the Dzees home app on my phone, connection or re-connection of the camera with wi-fi was very easy by following the guide book in the camera box. As directed in the book, I can only connect the camera with 2.4GHz wi-fi, and 5GHz wi-fi connection is not supported by the camera.4. This camera has a new place where an external micro-sd card slot and re-set button are located. You can find them after the back plastic case is squeezed off. I found this place of external storage card and re-set button can be more secure and protective from water damage than an old Dzees camera.5. The camera makes 20-second video recording at a time, which seems long enough for me to see anything suspicious. In addition, it provides free 7-days on-cloud access to video clips provided by the company. I did not pay any subscription fees to buy additional days (15/30/60 days) of video access.6. In addition to common features like \u20182-way audio\u2019 and \u2018sharing camera\u2019, the camera app can set \u2018Audible Alarm\u2019 function in the audio setting menu and \u2018Flashlight Alarm\u2019 in the lighting setting menu. The camera can sound an alarm or keep flashing when detecting motions, and I found they are valuable features if you monitor your properties requiring highest security. Please note that some advanced features, like intelligent notifications and activity zone, were not included in the free \u2018no plan\u2019 service, you need pay subscription fees to buy these features.7. For night vision, the camera can use either infrared mode or white light mode. When the white light mode is used, the camera will turn on its spotlight at night, which drains its batter power faster. Therefore, from my personal use experience, the infrared mode of the night vision is recommended for the battery power to last longer. (BTW, the capacity of rechargeable battery is 5200mAh.)In view of my usage experience, this camera is a worth-to-have product giving high-quality pictures and ensuring securities with a good price.",
