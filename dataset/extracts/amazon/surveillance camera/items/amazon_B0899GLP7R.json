                "reviewText": "UPDATED REVIEW: To those of you that couldn't connect to WiFi or stay connected, as was previously the case with myself using the Orb Mini Camera. I believe the problem is the directions, as they don't go in the order that the different events occur with the camera or don't relate to this specific camera period is what I've found. For example, when troubleshooting to connect during the initial setup process it advises to use the provided pin to insert it into the small WiFi reset button located on top of the camera right next to where you insert a micro sd card and it instructs to continue holding the pin in until you hear continuous music. That never happened for me after trying multiple times. However, I noticed when I was interrupted by someone speaking to me as I pushed the pin in and ALMOST immediately released rather than continuing to hold the pin in, then I did actually hear continuous music. So in other words, don't do a long press when inserting the pin to reset the WiFi or troubleshoot it. Simply insert until you feel the reset button definitely pushed the entire way in for like 1-2 seconds and then release. So that was 1 thing the directions were wrong about (unless my orb mini camera is defective and I'll know soon because I'm getting ready to install the 2nd one that I purchased that I was also getting ready to return). Another thing I noticed was the CLICKING sound that's a normal part of the process didn't actually happen as or when it indicated it should have but at a different time in the setup process. To be honest, only a few things matched in the order that the directions instructed, such as entering your WiFi name and password and showing the countdown as the camera tried connecting to it! I was that frustrated with it trying repeatedly to get it connected in an area of my home that I had excellent WiFi signal and no trouble on any of my other WiFi connected devices, and I even renamed the device, refreshed it several times, & deleted the device from the Netvue app a few times, and nothing seemed to work so I eventually just gave up, letting it sit where I was original going to install it (1 room away from the room my fios router sits in that I have located on the outside of a very tall desk, sitting on top of it so WiFi signal can travel freely throughout my home). However, several hours later, I glance at my phone after receiving notifications and Low & behold, in addition to the motion detection notifications for my 2 full sized orb cameras it finally showed the orb mini camera online showing me video footage. So then I immediately checked the settings to see what results it was showing in \"WiFi Analysis\" menu and it was like 80% or better for good WiFi signal. So this next part is VERY IMPORTANT, it showed in the Netvue app there was an available FIRMWARE UPDATE that needed done for the Mini Orb camera, but because previously I couldn't get the mini orb to stay connected to WiFi I was unable to complete the update. However, now that it was showing online several hours, allowing me to use the controls in the app to move the position of the camera, pan & tilt, and hear thru it (which by the way, the sound on the mini orb is AMAZING, much better than the full sized ORB cameras that the sound is all distorted and crackles, both on the camera itself and in the app), I decided to immediately complete the firmware update while it was still online and working properly. Since then its worked perfect. Morale of the story people (my shared experience), is DON'T give up. If you can even get it to connect to WiFi 1x and got thru most of the setup process (other than the firmware update), then just let it sit powered on for a few hours and then come back and see if it's working or check the app to see if you can view video from that camera. As mentioned earlier, I don't feel the directions for setting up the mini orbs are completely accurate, you just have to fool with the camera & app a bit and then possibly let it sit for a short while and things then seem to synchronize in a sense, it starts to work. I hope this helps some of you having WiFi connection issues because it really is a MIGHTY LITTLE CAMERA with excellent clarity for the video resolution & quality, and superb sound! Lastly, don't know if this will heal anything to any of you, but I am not subscribed to any of the Netvue security, motion detection, or human alert subscriptions, because I have found both services/features to work wonderful with the use of a San Disk 128 GB ultra micro sd card all on it's own. It allows me to go back they the video footage by date & time it using this timeline type feature that you can just swipe thru all time periods of video footage, it keys me share it via text, email, etc. I LOVE THESE CAMERAS and the fact this company doesn't try forcing you into using their online storage & security services like many other products would require. I have Xfinity home security service because it gets me a nice discount on home owners insurance, with 1 of their indoor cameras that goes for $199.99 and I can't do nearly the stuff I can with these cameras, such as moving the position of the camera, pan & tilt, zoom, and no audio....ORIGINAL REVIEW: Such a shame, guess you get what you pay for. Got this as a lightening deal and I thought the price was too good to be true. Also thought maybe the device itself was defective because I have 2 of the larger indoor Orb cameras and they work great, even 1 being at opposite end of my home as the router and on a different floor and it works great... So I bought a 2nd Orb mini camera few days ago just to make sure the 1st wasn't defective, but it was the same exact problems. Even the set up process didn't go in the order as the instructions advised. I'm returning both orb mini cameras, they're junk!",

                "reviewText": "We have three of these cameras now! Initially just had one for our garage to watch our dog when we weren\u2019t home and then got another when we had daughter and got one to keep at our cabin as well. You have to have the app up to watch/hear but can turn on noise/movement notifications if you don\u2019t want it on all the time. Also can only watch one camera live at a time but that is all we have needed. Totally worth the $30 and gives us piece of mind when we are out of hearing distance from our daughter.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Great camera for the price",
                "reviewText": "This is a great value and perfectly adequate camera for casual use. At $30, it packs a lot of useful features.Setup: Really easy. Camera can be set upright on any surface, or mounted to a wall. There is a tiny template for drilling/attaching/installing the small mounting piece. The camera is entirely controlled via the NetVue app. You need to create a NetVue account -- you can login w/Google or FB, or create a NetVue login. Following the included instructions, connection to Wifi was a snap. The app finds the camera, prompts the wifi/setup info, and you're instantly monitoring. You must be connected to the same wifi network.Controls: Very easy. The app includes a virtual 'pad' to rotate the camera side to side, and horizon to horizon. You can view in portrait or landscape mode. You can only rotate on one axis at a time, but you can get an entire 360 view around the camera. The middle button of the virtual pad will take a snapshot of the scene and save to the app. There may be some lag depending on your connection. In a good spot around my home, the camera is very responsive -- there is always going to be a *slight* delay since you are controlling and monitoring via your wifi network, but it's negligible if you're just focusing on one general area. By contrast, in a weaker part of my home, there is a significant delay, and some choppiness to the feed -- this is not an issue with the camera nor the app, as my phone loses and reconnects frequently in this area. Please keep that in mind if you're experiencing significant lag/choppiness. There is also a built-in speaker in the camera which you can speak through via the app.Quality: I want to stress that for $30, you should not expect super high resolution and smooth motion like you're watching a professional live television feed. You get a good, clear picture, real-time motion monitoring, and good screen captures. You can change between Standard Definition (SD) and High Definition (HD) modes, though the HD may be limited by your wifi speed/connection. Same goes for audio clarity through the speaker. WIth a good connection, you can hear what was said clearly.App: The app includes a *lot* of features and functionality. You can add an SD card to the camera to save recordings and replay via the app. There is also an option to use NetVue's cloud storage, which requires purchasing one of their cloud storage plans. There are links to a helpful forum, an FAQ, and contact information for support. There is Alexa integration. You can share device feed/controls with another NetVue user, set up a sleep mode schedule, and toggle night vision on/off.Night Vision & Motion Detection: Night Vision works very well. I tried in a dark room with some ambient lighting coming from another room, and the camera still broadcast a very clear b/w picture. It will switch automatically when it detects very low light. Motion Detection works great. The app will take a short video/screenshot of any motion it detects and then send a notice to your phone. Make sure you allow \"Notifications\" in the app itself (iPhone) in order to receive Motion alerts. You can limit to people, pets, vehicles, and many other choices, or simply detect \"all\" motions.Overall: Great little device for the price. Would work perfect as an indoor security cam, a baby monitor, a pet monitor, etc. I personally bought it to watch and get alerts on when the squirrels that live outside our place come by for a visit -- but, I would not recommend mounting and leaving this outdoors. It is not weather proof, and it is not meant for outdoor wear & tear. But, if you have a safe spot where you can mount and leave it, it will function just fine. The rotational motion is ideal for what we need, give the squirrels tend to walk right up to our door, or wait out on the ledge out front.",

It\u2019s convenient to be able to spin the camera around so you can see the whole room in case the cats are out of view of the current position. Up and down as well, so I\u2019m also able to see my cats all the way up on their cat tree. Truly a reliable camera, easy to use, durable, convenient. Any time I have had to contact customer support (only for reasons to help guide me through a couple of things since I\u2019m horrible with technology) they have been so helpful! Patient and clear communication. 5 star camera, great price.",
