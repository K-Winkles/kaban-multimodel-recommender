                "reviewText": "I read through the negative reviews to see what I was getting myself in for first and decided it was worth it. So far this is a great little device, easy to set up, easy to use, good quality images, and all for a pretty cheap price. A couple of things I saw repeatedly in the negative reviews:1) It's annoying because it captures everything, even when you're home walking around. My response: If you leave it on, of course it does. But you can turn it off directly from the device or from the app when you're away. You can even unplug it and it won't keep watching you. It's amazing how turning something off... actually turns it off2) It makes you pay for the subscription. My response: No it doesn't. You can skip that step in the setup. Admittedly it took me a few seconds to figure out how to not have to sign up for their cloud if you don't have an SD card, but then I saw the \"skip this step\" option and guess what? I skipped this step. It means I can't save recorded files, but I can still live stream. I suppose if you're using this for security purposes and think you may need a recorded file in case something happens then it won't work for that purpose. But also, what do you expect from a $40 device? Get a real security camera. Use this one for watching your pets or your baby from the other room.3) It stopped working. My response: Ok I've only used it for a few days so maybe I'll update when I've had it longer. But for this price, if it breaks in a year or so, I won't mind. If it breaks next week... different story.Overall, if you want it to have fun spying on your pets, don't let the negative reviews steer you away. This little thing does the trick of proving to me that when I'm not home, my pets are pretty boring.",

                "reviewText": "I recently acquired the eufy indoor camera, and I must say it has exceeded my expectations in almost every aspect. The enhanced 2K resolution delivers crystal-clear detail, ensuring superior image clarity for effective home surveillance.The 360\u00b0 pan and 96\u00b0 tilt auto-tracking feature provide comprehensive coverage, making it an ideal choice for vigilant pet surveillance.One of the standout features for me is the effortless integration with Apple Homekit . The camera easily syncs with Apple HomeKit and seamlessly integrates into eufy's indoor camera ecosystem. Only thing I don\u2019t understand is why it needs a Micro-SD card when I\u2019m using iCloud storage.The built-in two-way audio allows for immediate conversation and providing an additional layer of security.In conclusion, the eufy indoor camera combines advanced features, intelligent AI, and seamless integration for a top-notch surveillance experience. Whether you're focused on home security or simply want to keep an eye on your pets, this camera is a reliable and effective choice. Taking one star due to requirement of needing storage card despite using iCloud for storage.Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "I bought it to put in front of my living room window, inside the house, to zoom in on the staircase of the front balcony. Since I didn't want to mount them of the wall/ceilings, I purchased an adjustable security cam stand on Amazon.The quality of the image is very very good, so is the motion detector (no lag so far for the live feed ; connected to the house wi-fi network ; doesn't support 5ghz bands). I bought a separate 128gb micro SD card to put inside the camera so the video can be locally stored there. As for now, no monthly fees (I used to to own ''B-link Mini'' and ''Ar-lo'' security cam in the past.The only 2 cons that I saw is that the camera doesn't do a good job detecting a human from it's AI software (it would sometime detect a car as a human). But since it is a motion, it will still record. The other thing was the Infra-Red mode during night time recording. Since outside has some street lights, the camera IR mode will just record the camera itself (his own window reflection ; pretty weird phenomenon) and you will see some red dots that is coming from the camera. If I switch the IR mode off, it will record normally just like during the daytime (my guess would be that you have to be in complete pitch black room so that the IR mode function properly). No problem so far.In my book, this is a 10/10 in term of affordability, ease of use and quality. Get this model since you can adjust with a 360 rotation from your phone if needed ; not the fixed small squared (C24 model).",
