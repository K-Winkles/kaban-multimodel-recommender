The camera has a built-in light source that can further enhance visibility during the night. Moreover, it automatically turns off the light when motion is detected. In theory, this should deter potential intruders since the light goes off as soon as they enter the camera's range, which, in my case, is approximately 30 feet from where the camera is installed.",
