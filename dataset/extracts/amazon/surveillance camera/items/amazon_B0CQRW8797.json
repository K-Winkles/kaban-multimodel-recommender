                "reviewText": "I bought two of these mini cameras to ensure safety for a parent with dementia. I liked the idea I could use an app on my phone to make sure my mom was safe. The size of the cameras were perfect and they had a decent amount of \u201cstars\u201d at 4+. After struggling to connect cameras to the app and then hiding them at my mom\u2019s, I returned to my house only to find they would not stay connected to the app. I ended up returning cameras. When I looked up app ratings it only had two stars. Make sure you look up app rating on any camera before you buy!",
