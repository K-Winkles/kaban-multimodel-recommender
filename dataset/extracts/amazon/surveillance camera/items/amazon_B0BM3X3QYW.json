                "reviewText": "The picture quality is great. There are some learning curves though. I use the cameras in my basement. So I had to make special sockets for them so they didn\u2019t get shut off when someone turned the lights off. Also I\u2019m still trying to figure out how to stop it from sending me a notification e every time it does a screen change. I actually don\u2019t even know what a screen change is or why it does them. The timing seems random. You do have to buy a subscription for each camera if you want everything stored Remotely. The pricing is reasonable if you only have a couple cameras. But even if you don\u2019t get one it will at least take a picture and save it at every \u201cevent\u201d. You can also buy memory cards and store everything that way. I guess my only two problems are that it lights me up with a spotlight every time I move while I\u2019m sleeping if I fall asleep in my basement living room at night. I haven\u2019t figured how to turn that off. And they don\u2019t provide instructions. Also the \u201cscreen change\u201d notifications are annoying. I haven\u2019t figured out how to disable those. I know this sounds like complaining but it\u2019s really not. If I just took the time to figure out all the settings I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be great. They seem secure from hacking. Have a sleek design. And provide much better picture and zoom quality than my ring cameras that cost about 15x more. For the price you absolutely cannot go wrong. Set up is pretty easy too. I highly recommend them.",

                "reviewText": "I have used several different security cameras over the years, and am currently using 3 brands. Out of the box, this camera has a solid, well-constructed build that should last long. Setting up the camera was about average with no particular obstacles. I must say the picture quality is outstanding! The colors are vivid, and the picture is sharp, even when zoom-in. The pan/tilt feature works well, allowing a very wide field of vision. The rotation speed is fast, smooth, and efficient. The night vision is at the top level of all the cameras I've used so far. In pitch darkness, I can see clearly for at least 100 ft. So far it works well through the Tuya app, the same app I'm using to control another camera in the front of my house. The true test will be longevity, and staying online.I use a waterproof exterior electrical box to house the camera\u2019s connections and to route the electrical connection and ethernet cable to the interior of my house via a hole I drilled through the wall. The installation kit does provide a waterproof connection for the ethernet attachment cable.Note if you're going crazy with security... If you have more than 7 cams in one property or so I recommend putting cam 8, 9, 10, etc. on ethernet. You can get network congestion with too many on wifi, this happens with all security cameras, not just this one.What I like:1. Small and solid built2. Better lens, wider viewing with 8x zoom (wide-angle lenses), and 360-degree view with pan/tilt.3. 3 megapixels ( Super HD 2304x1296 )4. Easy installation bracket and easy access to the SD card5. Dual antenna for better-extended range connection and antenna mount are relocated in a better location and well covered6. 8 IR LED lights for better crystal viewing at night7. Easy access to the SD Card8. The 2-way audio9. Human body filteringCONs:Not a dual-band camera, still connecting to 2.4ghzI love this camera and recommend this camera.",

                "reviewText": "First let me say the pairing process to my network was super easy. NOTE: pair the cameras inside before placing them outdoor. So I waited for 3months before giving a review. If your like me, my main question was...how do the hold up in extreme conditions. I have 4 cameras (at each corner of home exterior) all are exposed to the elements. I live in Colorado so that should give you some clue. I've had high winds, blowing snow, Temps below zero. AND THEY ALL performed well. I do have one note of exception. The tracking seems to get a bit off in extreme cold. At times I found at least one camera loosing it's home position and rotating off view. In that case I switched from trucking to fixed mode. OH! the SD Card feature work very well. All data accessible and can be download from the camera to your local storage on phone via the app. Cametas support loop recording so once SD is full, it will override and start all over. So paying for cloud not necessary.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars EXCELLENT VALUE!",
                "reviewText": "Well, I guess I've had this device long enough now that I can tell you it's well worth the modest price they ask for it. It does everything the label claims. It detects motion and recognizes human forms, and it provides bright, sharply focused, and vivid images, both day and night. It needs to be paired with the necessary phone app and your wi-fi, and after that you have full control of the device's audio speaker, attitude, built-in LED lights, and microphone from wherever you are. I have only one issue with the product, however: I don't seem to be able to pair it with more than one iPhone at a time. If it will do so, I haven't been able to figure out how. At any rate, I'm giving the product 5 stars for excellent value and consumer serviceability.",
