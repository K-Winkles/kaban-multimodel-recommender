                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this small camera and have been seriously impressed with its performance. Despite its really small size, which is even more compact than I initially expected from the phone, the camera delivers great picture quality. Not just great for the size, but overall great (unlike some other ones I tested). The setup process was straightforward, allowing me to use it without any issues. The instruction is written in a really simple language.The picture quality would be nothing without battery.... and battery life on it is great. It lasts significantly longer than other cameras I've tried, which is a huge advantage for continuous recording. The durability of the camera is another high point; it feels robust and well-built, capable of withstanding various conditions without any issues. IN the same time it's still compact and reasonably lightweight. I really like that....and with all that, it's also affordable! Overall, I'm extremely happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it.",

This unassuming little gadget is the silent sentinel you need, and it\u2019s so simple to set upIt\u2019s discreet. Place it anywhere, and it just looks like another trinket. But, oh, the wonders it does quietly! It records clear, sharp 1080P videos, making playback feel like you\u2019re witnessing events live. And the motion detection? A game-changer. It ensures not a moment gets missed, recording everything once it senses movement, saving you the hassle of reviewing endless empty footage.Don\u2019t fret over not having real-time viewing. Honestly, it\u2019s a stress you don\u2019t need. This cam records everything in your absence, and you can review the clips at your leisure, no risk of prying digital eyes. It\u2019s security without the paranoia.Yes, it\u2019s not flaunting ultra-smooth 60fps videos, but for security needs, the 30fps clarity is more than sufficient. You see every detail, every face, every action. And there\u2019s no Wi-Fi setup or app downloads; it\u2019s plug-and-play at its finest, keeping your digital footprint nil.The battery life deserves praise, too. Up to 6 hours of continuous recording means it's got your back most of the day (or night). And with support for storage expansion, what\u2019s not to love?It\u2019s an investment in peace of mind, a non-invasive way to ensure your sanctuary stays safe. A must-have for anyone considering a reliable, straightforward security solution. Five stars all the way!",

I am satisfied with this trial product and would recommend it for the price.My 2 cents are below:Pros:- Seems to be doing both the job pretty well. It is a functional product- Clear picture quality (1080P HD) with wide-angle capability- Has motion activation & saves the video clip to the SD card when detected- TF card slot has 128GB maximum support in these to store the recording locally. They bundle a 64GB card in the package- Inbuilt rechargeable battery that can provide backup for up to 6 hours- Good build quality- Simple but detailed instruction manual included for reference- Comes with many accessories including cable and card readerCons (Nothing I see for the charger functionality but a few for the camera):- Records at 30fps only and no option for smoother 60fps smoother video recording- It does not harm to have mobile app connectivity through WiFi. I wish it had that feature too so have a real-time live feed when needed",
