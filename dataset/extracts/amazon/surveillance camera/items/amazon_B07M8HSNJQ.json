I've done a lot of CCTV camera installs, so none of this really threw me for a loop, but for the \"first timer\" it might be hard to figure out how to go about installing this. Hint: Go slow and figure it out BEFORE you get near a ladder. After that, it's mostly just a matter of juggling things until you get it all up in the air and pointed the way you want it. And, once it's all set, it just MIGHT stay where you put it. Might... There's no way to tighten the base to hold the camera ball, and oh yeah, you'll have to drill a HUGE hole to tuck in the \"4 way\" tiny joystick that manages the camera settings. But, if you go slow and work carefully you'll get a little more than you paid for. Not a bad camera - just a lower quality situation in terms of mounting - and probably, longevity.",
