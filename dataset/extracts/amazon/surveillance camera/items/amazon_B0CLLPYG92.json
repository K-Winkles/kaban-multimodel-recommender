The picture quality great and what I like the most it is small and give you the same quality as most high end cameras. Now if you need sound this camera does not offer it but for me I am okay with that. It you need a small and powerful purchase this one.",

The camera allows me to check to see if she is crying/barking, if she has settled ok. I am really pleased with the camera it does exactly what I wanted and has given me peace of mind. I'm not a very techie. person but the camera was so easy to set up after installing the relevant app on my phone. I'm really pleased with my purchase & would highly recommend this product.",
