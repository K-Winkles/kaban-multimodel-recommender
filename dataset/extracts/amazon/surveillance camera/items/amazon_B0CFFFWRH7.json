The camera will not connect via the app. However, per the manual and the description on here/Amazon you are suppose to be able to record 24/7 by just having an SD card inserted into the camera. This camera is not worth the money. All I needed was something to record 24/7 using an SD card but this camera will not even do that. I have contacted customer service support via email because that is the only method available. I received a response asking what the problem was despite my original email giving a detailed information about my problem. I responded back with the same information and I have yet to receive any solution from the company. You might as well say there is NO customer support for this product.",
