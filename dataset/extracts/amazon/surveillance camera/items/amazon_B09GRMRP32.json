                "reviewText": "The setup isn\u2019t hard.Download the app.Create an accountAdd the camera and connect to wifi.The Manuel is easy to follow.I had a little hard time have the camera scan the barcode to connect to wifi. ( Make sure your phone\u2019s light is all the way on)Image on the camera is super clear with wide views. (See photo to understand)The camera does need to be plug it. If you unplug, you can plug it back and it will reconnect itself. It willmake noise when it does as if you were connecting it for the first time.The camera has the capability for you to manually move at 360 degrees. The camera itself doesn\u2019t move.Two ways to store data, TF Card & Cloud Storage (You have to purchase separately like most security camera)If you want alerts send to your phone, or text notification or cloud storage from smartlife, that\u2019s additionalI have included the pricing of the storage cloud, phone notification and text notification. (See photo to understand)Without any services or SIM card, it does take images of detect movement. It will not notify you when it happen, you must open the app and view the images.(See photos to understand)There is privacy mode.I found it a little difficult to find a place to hide it without people seeing the camera since it has to be plugged in.",

                "reviewText": "I have placed this camera facing out a front window to get a view towards my driveway as the majority of time is spent in the back rooms. This camera works fine enough to view what I need it to, but is not the fine HD view you get facing into the home of course. I was really interested in it as the ad had mentioned it was Alexa compatible which would have been great viewing thorough the Show 8. But as noted in an earlier review, they are working on the Amazon Alexa Agreement, per their customer service rep. I would have preferred that instead having to have the app opened on my phone.Please note when setting the camera up, no matter how strong your wi-fi seems where you are using the camera, it states in the manual to be by your router to set it up. And even though I have no problems setting up other items away from the router, I had to be next to the router to set up the camera. But after initial set up, it works just fine where I want it to.Update:, my camera stopped functioning as it runs though the app Smart Life, and it looks like you have to register and/or set up an account with them. As this is the only camera I have going thru that app, I did not register with them so the camera is useless. As I have a lot of Blink cameras, this is no longer needed.",
