                "reviewText": "Pros and Cons:Alexa and Google Assistant Integration- Live video works well on Alexa- Live video works well when casting or using commands on Google Assistant- Live video DOES NOT work from the Google Home App or when manually accessing the feed.App- Perfect app with all the necessary settings for free.- All major necessary features are free, making this absolutely perfect.Memory- SD Card up to 128 GB (using a 32 GB)- SD Card memory and selected videos cannot be deleted besides formatting. However, a great feature that uses looping deletes the oldest video and replenishes it with new footage.Price- Without a doubt, the price is perfect for the build quality and all features.Night VisionI have not tried it for indoor views since my camera is pointed outside, which has a horrible reflection when the night vision mode is on. I wish the app would have a feature that uses grayscale-like night vision when you have the camera on the inside but with a window in front of it.",

                "reviewText": "I bought two of these cameras because we got a new puppy and I wanted to be able to check in on her throughout the day. Overall, these are great, especially for how cheap they are! The picture is clear but not \"HD\" clear and gets just a little grainy when you zoom in but overall, not bad. I like how easy it is to adjust the cameras so that they're pointing where you want them to. One thing to note is that the angle of the camera can't be adjusted from the app like some indoor cameras, so if that's what you're looking for, I'd go with another model. The motion detection is really good and you can choose to shut off individual cameras from the app. I purchased a 3rd one so we can have the majority of the inside of our small house covered and it's just under $11/month to have motion detection footage saved for 3 cameras (they have pricing options for 1 camera, 2, 3, and so on), which is a lot cheaper than most other brands since most charge $10 per camera a month. You can have them standing on a surface or you can mount them (comes with the hardware), however, we didn't want to screw anything into our walls, so I bought heavy duty double sided tape and the cameras are light, so they hold up well!",

My cats trigger it all the time, which is why I got it. I can check in on them when I'm not home. And even at home, I can be up front and see what's going on in the back. It has sensor triggers for person and babies crying. You can talk through it. Haven't tried the two way talk, but have used the speaker, it is fine.",

                "reviewText": "We purchased this product in lieu of a baby monitor for my daughter who does not stay in her bed at night. Overall, we have been very impressed with the product.Pros:-Night vision is excellent. I can even see if her eyes are open if she is facing the camera.-I am able to talk through the camera, so if she starts getting out of bed I can come through and tell her to stay in bed.-Motion detection works fairly well. Sometimes it does not go off when it should, but most of the time I get notifications as I should-Relatively easy to install. We have ours hung in the top corner of the room and it was not difficult to install.-The app is pretty simple to figure out and use. I used the free trial of the subscription just to see if it was worth it but ultimately the free version works great for what we use it for. If you are using these as a type of security camera, I highly recommend the subscription, so you have clips saved to memory automatically.Cons-It is probably just me, but sometimes I accidentally hit the alarm button when I am trying to hit the microphone button. The alarm is loud and scares the daylights out of my daughter.-Motion detection can sometimes be way too sensitive and go off for no real reaon.-It would be nice if there was a way to secure the cord to the camera - sometimes it gets pulled on (accidentally or otherwise) and comes unplugged at the camera.Overall - I would recommend this product.",

But after it sat for 5 minutes it would disconnect from my wi-fi and only reconnect when motion (wave my hand) would be present. That won't work for me. I went through support to find out this is apparently how it's suppose to work.....but I need a live view even if nothing is moving in front of the camera.UPDATE: From my original review I would like to update and say I WAS WRONG!! The outlet that I initially plugged into was a switched outlet. (No wonder the camera didn\u2019t work whe I left and shut off the lights\u2026.and power to the camera!!). I have three different manufacturers of cameras like this one, and I will stay this one is the easiest to connect to and work!! My only criticism is you cannot rotate left/right. But knowing that up front I would definitely buy again!!",

The picture quality is pretty clear, and the sound quality is excellent. I have used the microphone feature to talk to the person in the house and it is very clear. The only thing that is a negative for me, is if you have the app up on your phone, it asks every few minutes if you want to continue watching. Yes, I do, that's why I have the App up. You have to keep tapping the screen to indicate you want to continue. I would purchase it again.",

                "reviewText": "The photo you see is from the Tapo app, taken at night, during a fairly heavy snowstorm in Quebec Canada ey! The camera is setup in the bedroom, so picture is seen through a window, not bad ey! I also own an Ezviz indoor camera(CN6060 I believe) setup through a window also, but the light on the camera reflects in the window so I can't see anything at night.Tapo says night vision extends to 30 ft, but as you can see, houses on the other side of the street are at least 75 feet away and you can still see them, although I am sure streetlights help a lot. Night detection is 30 feet, maybe more. I set up the camera to detect persons only, and it works fine as long as persons step on my property. It does detect some persons on the street, if they walk on my side of the street.Audio is decent too, have not really used it, but did hear my wife that was standing at least 15 feet away from the camera. She made me turn audio off, camera is in the bedroom after all! :- ISetup is very easy, done in 10-15 minutes on both iPad and iPhone. This thing is so light, I taped it to the top of the window, upside down, adjusted the angle, reversed the picture in the app and I was done.You can view the camera feed on a computer through VLC media player (VideoLan, it's free to download). You need to setup a separate, free Tapo account account for this, I have read somewhere in the Tapo help that you can do everything with one account, but it did not work for me. Doc should be made clearer about this. After 3 days, the feed does not show on VLC anymore (still works fine on iPhone and iPad), but I will reboot eventually and it will probably work again. I need to input username and password in VLC everytime I want to see the feed, maybe I will dive into the VLC help and automate this.I have bought a micro SD card (128Gb max for this model) and will install it soon. Doc says that if you put in a card, the feed to external device (VLC in this case) will not work. I hope this is not the case, will see.Best part is that no membership is required. You get a 30-day free trial, but external feed will not work with membership or free trial, so I cancelled it before trying it out, so I can`t comment on membership.There is a 2K and maybe even 4K model of this camera, but since I own over 20 smart devices, my Wifi is not as fast as it used to be, Full HD is enough for now.This is a great camera, even more so if you're new to smart devices. I will probably buy a few more soon, especially if it stays or goes on sale again. ''Alexa, show me camera two''!Update Jan 23rd: Viewing the camera stream through VLC Media player stopped working after 2-3 days, VLC cannot connect to the camera. I setup Agent DVR free software instead and it works OK, but the picture is a bit grainy, but it does record detected persons automatically.Update Jan 28 2024: I have seen a review that says you have to pay the subscription fee for motion detection to work, this is not true. Motion detection (I set it to person detection only) works fine, I get a notification on my phone (see photo in french cause my iPhone is set to french) when a person is detected.",
