                "reviewText": "These fit my Eastman M-550 without modification of either the tuners or the mandolin. The holes for the screws at the ends of each plate required re-drilling with a finger drill but that could have been omitted were I not OCD. I also used the original Eastman bushings. It took less than an hour to do the swap even though I am not a craftsman and need to think everything through several times before daring to touch a screwdriver. These Grover tuners are far superior to the original tuners which were binding and hard to turn. The 18:1 gear ratio permits much more precise tuning than the original tuners. Total Music Source picked and shipped promptly and the tuners were delivered on time.",
