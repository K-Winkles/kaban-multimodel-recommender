                "reviewText": "The Litokam security cameras are great. I bought them for watching my elderly parent, who has been falling. I can now easily walk away from him or do some work and watch him on my phone. The app is easy and straight forward. The only tricky thing was connecting the cameras for the first time. You only need to be a 3-5 inches away from the phone when linking it.Picture quality is great. You can zoom in and zoom out. Night vision is pretty good. Sound for hearing is amazing. Motion detection is good too. Sound to talk and communicate through the camera from phone is ok.Also, using in the bathroom was difficult at first. I could not see the angles I need to see, so using the wall/ceiling attachment was pretty easy. Drill 2 holes the right size, put in the anchor and screw in to the wall. Gave me a great angle. Since it is upside down, you have to go into the setting for the camera-basic function settings- flip screen.Highly recommend, I will be adding 2 more cameras to the system.Cheers!",

I was able to use the app with reasonable ease from home and away. That being said, I thought the motion following aspect was not as good as I would've liked. There was too much lag and it wouldn't follow or detect a fast moving object. Setting the cameras up for the patrol mode was a little touchy and I had to reset the \"site\" points a couple of times to get it where I liked. Overall I'm very satisfied so far (I've only had the system up and running for a couple days). I wasn't expecting much considering the price but this exceeded my expectations. If the cameras didn't have the lag time (a couple seconds) and followed motion detection a little better, I would definitely give this 5 stars.",

If you choose to purchase their cloud save, you can save and view videos at any time. This is very helpful for us because we\u2019ve had a couple incidents where our pets have gotten into trouble. The automatic night vision system is super helpful because we don\u2019t have to change it once we turn lights off. Highly recommend these cameras.",

You can also move the camera around while watching it live on your phone. You can manually adjust it to film all angles or you can do it via your phone.However, there is a small slot to place a micro sd card. If you choose to place the micro sd to save video recording you will not be able to move the camera 360 degrees due to the card sticking out. To avoid that you can pay for their service which I am not too sure how much it is a month but I believe it records 24/7.Overall it\u2019s a great camera, not super efficient with the as card slot. I still use it so I it was worth it to me.",

It did come with brief setup instructions.I had bought a similar pet camera a month ago from another seller ( to keep an eye out for the wild cat outside we are feeding ) but it was now much more expensive, so I decided to try this seller which had a better price point.I liked that the cameras I choose are black as they blend in better with our darker furniture. The camera picture is very clear both in colour during the daytime and black in white for night vision.It does have the option, and comes with a base to mount it on the ceiling or on the wall ( white colour is also available ) but we just have it on a side table and on the counter as our preference.The motion detector works well. It will take a picture and send it to you when there is any motion. You can set the sensitivities. It does let you know when there is movement.You also have the option to watch live feed.I did not get any extra subscriptions. It is just perfect for what we need. I do recommend this product to others. Good for keeping an eye on the pets, baby or house.",

These cameras only takes a few seconds to boot up and connect to your Wi-Fi. Will be adding more to my home. Ideal for keeping an eye anywhere.

                "reviewText": "I've had & been using these little Litokam indoor home security cameras for several months now & they have been great ! I downloaded the little elf security camera app to use them with & this has also worked great without any issues ! You can choose & use a good selection of features within the app for the cameras like, motion detection, motion detection alarm, so you receive messages alerts to your phone or tablet. You can also choose the sensitivity, low, medium or high. You can also turn on motion tracking so the camera will follow the subject & it's movement. You also have sound detection, where if it picks up unusual sounds, you will receive an alert. You can also choose human detection where it will only react to human forms & their movements, instead of picking up any & all other movements. You can also set schedules to. They also have night vision, which is a great feature to have when the lights are out. Plus it's great that you have the option of inserting a micro SD card to record your footage on. You can also choose to have & pay monthly or yearly subscription for a storage cloud within the app for the cameras if this is a better option for you as well. Also within the app, you are able to turn the cameras of your choice off using private mode if you don't want them on & recording continuously or you want some privacy. They are also really handy if like me you have any pets as well. It gives you peace of mind knowing if you have to pop out & about & go anywhere, that you are able to check on them & make sure they are all safe & sound. This Is one of the main reasons I decided to purchased them. They come with everything you need, so they are ready to set up & go straight out of the box & once connected to the little elf camera app. They are great little home security cameras & they've worked perfectly for me.",
