We use them when we go on vacation for a few days, to check on our house and our cats. I set up 4, they install easily, set up quickly and do a great job giving us peace of mind. I did have 3 of these before, for our trip last September, and our modem died in April so they were cut off from the Wifi. And no matter what I did when I got the new modem up and working, I could not reset these to get to connect again. So, I had to buy new ones. For the price, I really didn't mind, but it was annoying that I spent three days trying to connect the old ones and they just wouldn't do it. I'm hoping this won't happen again in similar situations.",

                "reviewText": "I have had IP cams before, and needed one. I chose this one because it was similar to my others. But the quality of the pictures is not very good. I rely on both day and night views. I have a thermometer in one room where I can point the camera to see how to adjust the room temp. My other camera got a nice clear picture day and night. This camera gives me such a fuzzy and blurred image, I can barely read the numbers on the thermometer. When scrolling around the room, the camera has jerky movements. The worst thing is when you open the app, the page is almost entirely one big ad every time, and you have to get out of that before you can view an image! I would not choose this camera next time.",

                "reviewText": "This seemed like a great find, because it was difficult to find a 5Ghz compatible wifi camera for under $50. It\u2019s easy to set up and easy to use. Installing the SD card took a few tries, but functions properly after successfully reformatting the SD card. I don\u2019t love the black & white view when it\u2019s dark, but it\u2019s not a deal breaker. It\u2019s a decent camera with a lot of good features, like motion detection, motion following, alerts, and recording. It also has a mounting kit to hang it and a usb plug, so usb extension cables can be used for a clean look. We will purchase more of these for other rooms!**UPDATE: I knocked off a star. The app has changed to disable video viewing (an ad for their cloud service covers the entire viewing area), and there seems to be some kind of malfunction with the SD card. At this point I cannot successfully reformat the SD card, view any prior videos, or even turn the camera off. The app keeps insisting I purchase their cloud service, and I guess they\u2019ll go as far as disabling features that were originally included with purchasing the camera. This is a big turn off for me. I had planned to buy more cameras for other areas of the house, but now I\u2019ll be going with something else. It\u2019s just obnoxious.***Update 2! Knocked off two more stars. I avoided updating the app, but then got a new phone. Now, not only are some originally included features disabled (like video playback with the SD card), but I get an ad EVERY time I look at the camera. This is beyond obnoxious, and I can\u2019t wait to replace this camera. My advice - keep looking.",
