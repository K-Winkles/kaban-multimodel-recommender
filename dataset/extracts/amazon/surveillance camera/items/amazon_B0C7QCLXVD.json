                "reviewText": "Over all, I kind of like them, but they are falsely advertised.To start, they to not have 'BNT' etched on the side as the picture shows. - I could care less about this, but I'm pointing it out, because it is not what is depicted.Also more importantly, the ad states that they rotate 360 degrees, and they absolutely do not. The base of shift itself is stationary, and does not pivot or rotate at all, and it only hinges at a 90 degree angle, either straight, or bent, on a solid axis.I was still able to make it work, but this aspect is important to some people, and needs to be advertised properly.I cannot say how long the light will last, or the battery life, but it does work well, and they do look legit from a few feet away.Over all, it's an alright item, that will possibly make an intruder or porch pirate think twice. - I wouldn't rely solely on them for security, but they're okay.",

If not, please contact us for free new ones right now'!
