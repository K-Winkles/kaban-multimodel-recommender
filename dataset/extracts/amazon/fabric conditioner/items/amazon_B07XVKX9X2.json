Unlike the detergent samples I used in the past, this left zero lingering scent on my sheets, and the lingering fragrance was my *entire reason* for purchasing. You would think that the combination of detergent, fabric softener, and a dryer sheet would leave the scent, but no. Nada. Nothing. And for fifty bucks, I can't justify keeping it.Also the pump dispenser on the fabric softener wouldn't pop up, so I had to guess what the appropriate amount was and pour it in.Overall - Super disappointed. I don't know if something changed since I got samples a few years ago? But beware if you're looking for a lingering warm scent on your laundry. This isn't the product for you.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased the triple combo.. came with detergent, liquid fabric softener, and dryer sheets all in Sandalwood Scent. Been trying to find if there are any laundry detergents out there that can compete with Tyler Candle Company (as for as how pleasant the scent is, strength of the scent, and how long lasting it is). Frey Sandalwood, as excited as I was to try it based on reviews, it is a 110% let down. The scent inside the containers is wonderful but that doesn't matter if it doesn't transfer to the clothing. I have washed and dried 3 loads of clothing using up to 10x pumps of Frey Sandalwood detergent and softener while also using up to 2x dryer sheets per load. You can easily smell the scent through that area of the house while washing and drying..... HOWEVER... directly after being dried, all 3 loads of laundry you can bury your face so hard into, almost to the point of suffocation and the only scent you can smell is the insides of your nostrils. I can't even fathom how that's possible honestly. What very little scent that does exists, is like dirty water. Tyler Candle Company's scents Diva and Kathina so much more worth your money. Their scents are unmatched and can last months on end with certain laundry items. Frey, why does the scent just vanish?!",

You get a great clean and the scent from the FREY overpowers the honey lavender. It smells great, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend paying extra for the dryer sheets! Best used as a scent booster!",
