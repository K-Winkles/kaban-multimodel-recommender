Bacteria can spread from one fabric to another in the laundry basket, from the washing-machine drum to the next load. Some these bacteria can survive a wash cycle and can cause potential infection risk with pathogenic bacteria. When it comes to certain laundry loads such as children's clothes or sportswear, you want your detergent to eliminate bacteria that can cause illnesses and create lingering bad smells. But detergents alone don't actually kill all bacteria. Introducing Lysol Laundry Sanitizer, an additive specially designed to kill 99.9% of bacteria left behind. Simply add Lysol Laundry Sanitizer to your rinse cycle. It does not contain any bleach and even works in cold water so is safe to use on most fabrics including whites, colors and darks.",

Sometimes the bath towels would still have a musty smell after washing and drying, but this has cured that. The only thing was they did leak a little during shipping, but not enough to lose any measurable amount of the product.",
