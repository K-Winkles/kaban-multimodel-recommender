I always wash my whites separately adding bleach, or bleach + regular oxiclean. Thought I\u2019d try this since I normally use cold water (which isn\u2019t really cold in Singapore, more like 20+deg C at min). My load with White Revive turned out as it did for regular Oxi with bleach. I\u2019ve yet to try using regular Oxi on its own.",
