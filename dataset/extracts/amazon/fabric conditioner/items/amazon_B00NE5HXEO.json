                "reviewText": "Sonett Organic Wool Care has been a wonderful product for my merino wool shirts and socks. It can seem like an expensive product, but as it turns out, just a very small amount is needed for a full tub of hand-washable woolen items. My only not so positive comment concerns the container. The plastic of this container is extra heavy duty, and very thick.-sided. I'm a strong handed person. I have no physical limitations, and this container gives me a hard time. If my hands are wet, which they are likely to be, from filling a basin with water, I can't manage this at all. The squeezer thing (the nozzle) is very resistant to pressure, so I find it necessary to dry both of my hands, before holding the container against the side of the basin, to release a bit of the product.I can recommend this product. It does restore softness and sheen to merino wool clothing items. Removes any itchiness that has been developing. Will purchase again.",

                "reviewText": "I used 1-2 Tablespoons because I looked at the wrong instructions, added hot water to dissolve, then look warm water to fill a small basin. Trying with sweaters that fit but are smaller from bring laundered carefully. (Love the washable wool sweaters, but back to the others\u2026). They appear to be softer, stretchier and fitting better. I think every sweater should be measured when first bought, so the size differential can be seen clearly. One very wide sweater, we hitch went in the reused water, lanolin mix, has sleeves that have not been made wearable! I may take the sleeves off. Just do a few per day. Who needs wet towels everywhere. I dried them on a hangar, which may have changed the outcome. I recommend this since I have nothing else. Buying lanolin and making your own would be interesting, because there is this dissolving part anyways.",

                "reviewText": "I bought nine of the Aran Island hand knit merino wool sweaters last year. The tag says dry cleaning recommended, or hand wash. I hate the chemicals left in dry cleaned items, and trying to hand wash these sweaters is almost impossible. They are so thick and heavy, it's like trying to hand wash a blanket. I have a washing machine with a super delicate cycle that has worked great on cashmere sweaters, so I decided to try it with these Aran sweaters. I used an oversized lingerie bag, cold water right out of the tap (about 45 degrees) and filled the machine about 3/4 full. It only agitates for seven seconds, and then stops for seven seconds. I did an extra rinse and then put them in the dryer on Air only for five minutes. Hung them on a sweater drying rack, and shaped it back to its original size. This product left them feeling better than new because of the lanolin, and it didn't fade or bleed the colors. I use the same method on my wool blankets. I will never be without it.",
