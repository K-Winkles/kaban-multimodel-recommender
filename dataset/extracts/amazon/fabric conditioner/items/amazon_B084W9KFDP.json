Im allergic to all the fabric softeners at my local stores, so I tried this instead. I\u2019m on my third bottle of this, and I can\u2019t complain. It works, I like the smell (it just has a clean smell, it\u2019s very light which is good because strong smells make me sick), you don\u2019t have to use much, etc. I just wish for the price it wasn\u2019t such a small bottle, but I guess for the ingredients it\u2019s worth it.It\u2019s definitely worth a try if you have sensitive skin that\u2019s easily irritated like mine.",
