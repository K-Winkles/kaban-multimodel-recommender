But Downy Fabric Softener smooths and strengthens fibers to protect clothes from the damage of the wash, helping them maintain their shape. By smoothing fibers, Downy reduces the friction between them that causes them to break and leads to pills and fuzz. And when fibers break, colors appear duller, so using Downy also helps keep your clothes from fading.",

I don\u2019t know that it does anything for static, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s designed for that. Also I feel they are intentionally vague on the amount to use so that you use far more than you need. And it\u2019s expensive for what it is. It also suds if you shake it, so clearly something is getting left behind.I have to use hypoallergenic everything these days, and I will say it doesn\u2019t seem to bother me in the free and gentle version.Overall, I think this is probably a waste of money. Instead of buying this, spend the money on really good laundry detergent and maybe some Borax for the tough loads.",
