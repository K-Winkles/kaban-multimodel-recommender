                "reviewText": "Appearance: They look so much better than the laundry detergent and softner containers. Labels are great added touch.Size: Decent size. Guessing I will likely only need to refill every 3 weeks and we do 1-2 loads per day.Spout Function: These containers are air tight most likely to prevent spilling if tipped over. Basic physics you need air flow for proper spout flow so I simply removed the rubber seal from around the lid and have no issues with spout flow now. Granted they are no longer spill proof but given the location of them in my home, I don\u2019t anticipate them tipping over. Also, the viscosity of my laundry detergent was a tad too thick for a fast flow so I filled the container about 2.5\u201d from top, added 1/2 cup of water and a 3/4 cup of clear liquid Dawn (I add Dawn to every load anyway so this is a more convenient way) and now have a nice fast spout flow.The lack of a hole for air flow is the only reason I didn\u2019t give it 5 stars. I imagine you could also drill a hole in the lid in lieu of removing the rubber seals.",
