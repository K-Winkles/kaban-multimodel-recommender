I have had compliments from our town's hospital, calling to ask what kind of laundry detergent & softeners that I used on my mom's clothing! I took that as a great compliment! I am so glad that this vendor is still offering these for sale, due to the fact that I can no longer find them in any retail stores I have visited recently!!! \ud83d\ude42",
