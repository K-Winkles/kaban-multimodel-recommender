You can definitely find regular softeners that give more softness, but for me the softness level with this one is enough. It works great with both cottons and more delicate fabrics.It's more pricey for the quantity and I do use more than the recommended dosage to get the results.I had the Blue Eucalyptus and Lavender one, and while I could feel the scent in the bottle, it does not stay on clothes. Which I personally like, I prefer my clothes not to smell like fabric softener.I have sensitive skin and this worked great for my skin. I try to use all biodegradable products in the house and this product is a good alternative for fabric softener.",

                "reviewText": "Works well but the natural oils/ingredients can go rancid in this product. Twice now due to the heat here in Singapore, the product has separated and developed a rancid oil odor - once in my house and once before I even received the product and the liquid was already super thick and smelling foul. The separation is discussed on the label as a consequence of cold temps, but I doubt the product testing involved equatorial import conditions.",
