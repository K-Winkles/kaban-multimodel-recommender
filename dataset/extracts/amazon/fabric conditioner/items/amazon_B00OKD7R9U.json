                "reviewText": "I really like the soft chamomile scent. It smells like baby soap or a baby\u2019s room. I\u2019m not fond of the Sweet Lullaby because it smells more commercial like a downy softener. After the dryer the scent is very mild, so it won\u2019t be overwhelming. This softens well and doesn\u2019t irritate my son\u2019s sensitive skin. The formula is very thin, which I like because it seems like it won\u2019t be sticky with a lot of build up, like other brands.I\u2019m updating this review. I tried a couple more scents and the sweet lullaby and unscented are thick as hell. After just a week my washer was completely clogged up. I poured boiling water into the lines to try to dissolve some of the softener, but it would not dissolve. It\u2019s thick and sticky like wax of some sort. I then used pipe cleaners to get some of the sticky residue out, which worked enough so I could use my detergent compartment again. I can\u2019t imagine what this is doing to my clothes if even boiling water will not dissolve this stuff. I didn\u2019t believe the other comments about it being this bad, but it is. The Chamomile does not have this issue, so I would fully recommend that scent.",

                "reviewText": "Softens beautifully in the final rinse, does not stain, LOVE that it is all natural with non-toxic, plant-based, totally safe ingredients (most fabric softeners are a hazardous waste abomination, Google it) which are also specifically non-carcinogenic. LOVE this environmental and humanely mindful and conscious company out of fabulous Canada and their whole MO and vision. Spectacular. What I do not like is this particular scent, as it just reminds me too much of Downey, etc. Smells just like it. I haven't tried any other versions, so I will, to find my preferred scent, but otherwise--THIS IS THE ONE. The cleanest fabric softener in existence. (Even on EWG.) And it WORKS! And that, my friends (if you knew what I knew about traditional fabric softeners; that they contain on average 6-8 out of 10 (carcinogenic!) ingredients found on the EPA's most hazardous waste list)--is no small feat. Way to go, Attitude! I love you people. Thank you for doing what you do and making these gorgeous, safe, effective products for mindful, health-conscious families. Your company is my new Gold Standard!",
