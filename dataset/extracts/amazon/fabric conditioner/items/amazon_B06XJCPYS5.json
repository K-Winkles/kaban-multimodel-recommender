                "reviewText": "As others have stated, this scent is heaven. I am disabled and unable to go into stores, so I had to trust reviews, NONE of which actually describe what the scent is..... So my attempt is say that the scent smells like orchids and mulberry with a hint of cedar and musk. I lived in Hawaii and it definitely has a similar smell to my orchid garden at night. It isn't overly floral, and has a sweetness to it, but there is a sort of sexy muskiness floating under the surface. That being said, it's a nice daytime scent because of the fruity notes. In other words, it's not like a sexy cologne. Rich natural scent, but a little smokey/powdery. Very hard to describe, which may be why others have not tried. I hope this helps someone else. I'm really glad I chose to try it. It beats out my previous CALM choice which was a Lavendar and Vanilla. Also, it really imparts a good scent onto the clothes. It doesn't just smell up the laundry room like some other brands that dont really stick to the clothes.",
