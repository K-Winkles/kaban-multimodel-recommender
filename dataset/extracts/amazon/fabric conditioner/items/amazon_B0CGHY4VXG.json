                "reviewText": "I really don't like lugging jugs of detergent let alone a jug of fabric softner to the laundry room and trying to juggle it all carrying my laundry basket. To be honest it's just me but I don't even like using liquid fabric softener don't ask me why maybe it's the additional step or never felt I needed to. I ran across the CLEARALIF laundry Fabric Softener Sheets, Lavender Scent and I already have changed to laundry detergent sheets as my preferred form of detergent. I find though that detergent sheets don't leave your clothes with any detectable scent no matter what brand I've tried. So after reading the fabric softener sheets reduce static, soften fabrics, AND leave clothes scented I decided to give them a whirl.I can't say I really expected very much being laundry detergent sheets leave no scent even if they clean my clothes extremely well. I used two sheets for a larger more soiled load of clothes. I tossed them in the dryer along with my wool dryer balls. Taking the clothes out later indeed the fabrics felt really soft. I even have a pair of normally scratchy ribbed texture boxer briefs and even THEY felt way better than I've ever seen. The sheets actually improved the texture so I guess I won't be so hesitant to wear them saving them as my last resort pair until laundry day.I notice the slight lavender scent but it is really light. For me I do wish it was a little more intense as I like lavender's smell. As for wrinkle free welllll for the most part in conjunction with using wool dryer balls yes my clothes were a little less wrinkled but not perfectly wrinkle free I won't make like there weren't areas on my shirts here and there. Overall even the condition of my clothes was a noticeable improvement.I'm very pleased now how my clothes feel and less static using these and ease of use in general. Makes my job a lot simpler and less hassle. I'd even order these again even if they don't necessarily give off as much scent as I'd like.",

                "reviewText": "We are super excited to have these for traveling. We do months on the road and this product will be amazing given our limited storage space. We tried the Clearalif Softener sheets at home and found them to work great on an average size load of clothes. We did not find the scent to be very close to lavender, just our opinion. It's more of a generic fresh scent which is soft and not offensive, just not super like lavender. This did not diminish the experience - we'd rather it work and be convenient and it checks those boxes for us. Given the convenient and effectiveness of this product we still consider it 5 star quality.",

                "reviewText": "Never used fabric softener in my laundry, but then again, I'm a guy. Good excuse, right?These were interesting to try. These are dissolving sheets that you throw into your laundry along with detergent. I used one sheet on a fairly large load.By the time my clothes were dry, I put my nose to my clothes and sure enough, they had a nice, fresh scent that was noticeable without being overpowering. And, I would also conclude that they did feel softer than usual.So, hats off to these fabric softener sheets for not only working as advertised but for being so easy to use. Just throw a sheet in your washing machine and you're set!",

My clothes didn't seem much softer than usual. I did not have any static issues with my laundry, but that is normal for me even without these softener sheets. Though there's not any huge noticable difference I hope the sheets are improving the quality of the laundry at a level I can't see and protecting the fibers and everyone like claimed. I really appreciate the eco friendly design and the convenience that these sheets have. No bulky bottle to store, less plastic usage, easy to use without pouring or measuring, small and light which is nice for taking on the go.",
