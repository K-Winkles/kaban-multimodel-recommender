It's versatile enough to be used on bedding, curtains, and other household fabrics as well.Rapid Touch Technology: The rapid touch technology really sets this product apart. It works quickly, which is essential for those last-minute touch-ups before heading out the door.Overall Experience: Bounce Anti Static Spray, 3 in 1, has consistently proven to be a reliable and high-performing product.

I hate to iron and I have some jeans that come out of the dryer with the hem rolled. I spray this and smooth it and do not have to haul out the ironing board just for the hem. Smooths wrinkles, removes static and freshens - all in one.",
