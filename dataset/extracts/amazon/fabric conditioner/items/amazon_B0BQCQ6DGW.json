Our beads use scent lock technology, which locks in freshness for up to 12 weeks. Keep your clothes and linen smelling fresh for up to 3 months. Can I use these beads with my front load machine? Yes. Our laundry beads are fine to use with your front loading washer. Simply place one bead in the soap receptacle with your regular powder or liquid and run the machine normally. Can I use these beads with my top loader? Yes. Our scented beads are also safe to use with a top loading washing machine. After adding the clothes, just toss a laundry bead into the machine and let it dissolve under the water filling the drum. Will these soften my clothes? The answer is \u201cyes, but just a little bit\u201d. Our scented beads are designed mainly for fresher smelling laundry. While they will help to boost the softness of fabrics, their main purpose is to make clothes and linen smell fresh. Are these really plant based? Yes. We\u2019ve used a completely plant based formula using starches and botanical extracts. Our scented laundry beads also use lemon extract for a zesty aroma and are safe for people with sensitive skin.",

The freshness they bring to the laundry is truly invigorating. The lemon aroma is both uplifting and refreshing, making the whole laundry process much more enjoyable.The eco-friendliness of these granules is something that resonates deeply with me. I appreciate that I can enhance the scent of my laundry without resorting to harsh chemicals or artificial fragrances. The fact that they're designed to be environmentally conscious makes them even more appealing.One of the standout features for me is how well the lemon scent lingers on the laundry. I love the way it adds a subtle, yet noticeable, freshness that lasts. It's reassuring to know that even after the drying process, the delightful lemon fragrance remains, making the entire home smell wonderful.In conclusion, I find these lemon-scented laundry scent booster granules to be a delightful addition to my laundry routine. Their ability to infuse a natural, long-lasting lemon scent into the fabric, combined with their eco-friendly design, makes them a product I'd gladly recommend to anyone looking to elevate the freshness of their laundry experience.",

                "reviewText": "I have been making my own non-toxic laundry detergent for years in an attempt to limit the amount of xenoestrogens that my family is exposed to. Once I started making my own laundry detergent and removed all of the synthetic scents from our laundry we noticed that when we were around those scents they seemed very potent! We had become \u201cnose blind\u201d to the scents when we were using them. But once we eliminated them they become noticeably over powering. Fast forward several years\u2026 we were missing that satisfactory \u201cclean\u201d smell you get with a fresh load of laundry\u2026 but wanting that without the toxic effects. I stumbled across these non-toxic scent boosters and thought I\u2019d give it a try. The smell is very soft but noticeable and we only use about 1/4 tsp per wash load. We are a family of 8 and one bottle of this product will last me about 2 months\u2026 and I do lots of laundry! I think if you have eliminated mainstream laundry detergent from your household and have grown accustomed to no scent\u2026 that these scent boosters will be great for you! You will be able to notice a mild clean sweet-lemon scent. If you, however, are used to regular Tide (or whatever your favorite brand is) you may be disappointed in this product because it will seem too faint.",

                "reviewText": "This stuff makes laundry smell great...a light citrus floral scent. It's light and natural, and that's how I want my laundry to smell...not perfumed or detergent-y. If you expect this is going to make your laundry smell heavily perfumed like the chemical-laden products you find at mainstream stores, you will be disappointed.I purchased this because I recently switched to natural laundry detergent strips which have almost no fragrance, and I do like a little bit of a fresh scent on my clean clothes. This product is perfect. I use 1 teaspoon for a small load, 2 teaspoons for an average load, and 3 to 3.5 teaspoons for a large load. I dump this directly into the washing machine and allow it to dissolve in the water for a couple minutes with the detergent sheets before I put the laundry in. It rinses clean and everything smells fresh.I follow up in the dryer with wool laundry balls that have a few drops of scented oil on each. When the laundry is dry, everything has a nice, light, fresh and natural scent.He price is a little high, but I am willing to pay because I am committed to natural laundry products.",

                "reviewText": "I really wanted to like this product, but right from the start everything about it was not good. When I opened it, the sticky cover holding back the scent beads was not attached to the package and about 1/3 of the beads, which are so very tiny, spilled out of the packaging and went everywhere. After cleaning up that mess, I figured let's try them out. I was surprised at how small the contrainer was..the amount of scent beads inside is close to the size of a can of soda. But I thought, well maybe you don't need to use alot of them. I was wrong. I ran a load of laundry and put way more than the recommended amount because I was washing bedding. They smelled good in the package, but the scent didn't really carry over very well to the fabrics. I could barely smell them after washing and drying. And after a day or two the scent was completely gone. Honestly, I think the beads are so tiny that they just fall through the holes in the washer machine. For how much this product cost, how little you get, and the fact that they don't even work well, I was very disappointed. Look elsewhere for good scent beads.",
