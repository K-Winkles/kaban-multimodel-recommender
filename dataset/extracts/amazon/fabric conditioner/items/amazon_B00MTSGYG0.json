                "reviewText": "My mom used Bounce when I was growing up and because of that, it has always been included in my laundry adventures. The smell is delicious, but not overpowering. As the price has slowly climbed over the years, I have tried generic brands. Every store brand I've tried has not come anywhere close to the predictable results of Bounce. When I got rid of my ancient washer and dryer a few years ago in favor of new HE machines (big mistake!), I changed over to a well-known, liquid, blue fabric softener based on the recommendation of the salesman. WHOOPS! I wound up throwing over half that bottle away - and returned to Bounce.Bounce makes my clothes soft and they smell good. I will admit to not fully knowing about static cling until I changed brands of fabric softener, but upon crawling back to Bounce, every single time I was quickly reminded how static cling doesn't have to play even the slightest role in your laundry, or life. The price I've found here on Amazon absolutely blows away the prices demanded by local stores - we're talking about paying a THIRD of local prices. If I can buy three of these on Amazon for the cost of one locally - including shipping - I'm sold! I truly don't know why anyone would waste their money on another fabric softener...Bounce is that good. I have a lifetime of experience being surrounded by fabrics dried with it...and that won't change anytime soon. When you find a great product, you stick with it. That's why I highly recommend Bounce!",

Recycle the bounce sheets! I have found that they are a great way to get bug marks off your car without damaging the paint (they work well when they are wet). I am horrible at marking my clothes with deodorant so I keep used sheets in my bathroom and rub the fabric with short, quick strokes. I also wipe my hairbrush as I found it helps significantly to reduce hair static. Soak a used dryer sheet with nail polish remover to remove glitter polish from your nails. I use the recycled sheets to wipe down the washer and dryer as they tend to be magnets for the lint. I also use the recycled sheets to remove the heavy pollen in the spring when washing the windows. In addition, the recycled sheets are used consistently in my household on baseboards, door frames, dashboard, etc.",
