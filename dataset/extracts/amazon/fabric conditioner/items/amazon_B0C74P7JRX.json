                "reviewText": "These arrived packaged in a non-descript white paper envelope measuring about 6\u00bd\u201d x 9\u00bd\u201d x \u00bc\u201d and weighing just over (5\u00bd) ounces (no need to struggle with oversized plastic bottles of detergent and softener). I opened the white envelope to find two (2) cardboard paper sleeves of similar size as the envelope, just thinner. The one (1) sleeve had Tru Earth\u2019s Laundry Detergent [white in color] Eco-Strips and the other their Fabric Softener [pink in color] Eco-Strips. Both noted they were Ultra Concentrated. Both cautioned they were eye irritant\u2019s and to wash hands, after use. Both contained 32 strips, representing a single load. The laundry sheets weighed in about 2\u00be ounces and the softener sheets were just under 2\u00bc ounces. There was no reference as to what constituted a \u201cload.\u201d Is it by weight or some sort of volume? Do I guess? Small loads are a half strip; normal is a strip and large is two (2) strips. The scent boosters were linen, and they had a strong aroma, but I did not such offensive. There is a reference for all machines and HE machines. However, nothing whether one (1) machine should have different amounts of strips. My understanding is that a medium load is 6 pounds of clothing, a large load is 11 pounds and an extra-large is 21 pounds. Each sheet is about 37 cents, as of August 2023.These are a good value, considering you the number of loads.The scent smells wonderful and leaves a light scent to the clothes, which is not that long-lasting. [There is no accounting for smell, so it\u2019s up to the individual beholder to decide about the fragrance. It\u2019s not annoying and is more typical than atypical of a strong linen scent.]I use a top-loading high efficiency [HE] wash machine, with an agitator. Our area has hard water, so a single to two sheets seems to lather-up nice for a large load. For a super-sized load, we may use as much as three (3) sheets to four (4) sheets. Our wash machine is big and deep. I simply drop-in the necessary sheets in, I do at the start, load laundry, allow the cycle to go through. Since we typically run larger loads, we use more laundry sheets. The sheets, to me, are delicate and can tear easily, on the other hand, they also dissolve fast. Liquid mess, of course is eliminated, but I wash my hands after touching these sheets or I wear gloves.There is a reference that these are hypoallergenic, which I believe, because no skin irritations were caused.These sheets are part of a category which focuses on an interest in sustainability, environment, and being biodegradable.No direct pre-soak option with sheetsTo test, I had clothes with various stains, a little, not a lot, such as blood, food stains, salad oil, chocolate, coffee, dirt, and grass. I know these stains are hard to remove. Now the problem with these sheets, is that I cannot put detergent directly on the stain, to soak in. I washed in cold water, normal cycle, cold water, maximum spin, and extra heavy cycle. I think the results fair. Again, normally, I pretreat. But I wanted to see what would happen. The stains were still there, just lighter. I think for a non-stained wash, these are competitive, but I am not tossing out the liquid detergent at this time.Country of origin?Made in CanadaThoughtsI like the idea of no plastic, no space hogging bottles, and the other mentioned factors, like value, these are less than other sheets, which saved this from a three (3) star rating. Cleaning is fair, not stellar. Aroma is nice.I hope my thoughts added helpful information.",

Washing became a nightmare because I found I was rewashing at least half my load. Then I found these sheets. I can't tell you how much I love them. Where have they been. No one talks about laundry detergent. These sheets do the job. One and done. Just like the good old days. Just throw the two sheets in the washer and that is it. No residue. Just clean laundry. Now I have to mention the smell. It truly is amazing. Fresh and clean. This makes me look forward to laundry days. Just remember it cleans but doesn't remove stains. So you still have to treat any stains. I love these sheets. Recommend to family and friends. Try them, you will love them.",
