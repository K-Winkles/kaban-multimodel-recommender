Recently noticed my kiddo and I are super sensitive to fabric softeners and even some detergents. I\u2019m not BIG on natural and plant based products - but I do like using them when I can. Especially in hygiene and health. This detergent is plant based AND smells great. I find the smell to be sort of fruity and floral and sweet. For a plant based product, the scent really lasts too! I usually like trying new things, but I think I\u2019ve found our new pereferred detergent.",

Same great detergent but in an ecologically friendly package which uses much less plastic and is very convenient to use. Highly recommended.",
