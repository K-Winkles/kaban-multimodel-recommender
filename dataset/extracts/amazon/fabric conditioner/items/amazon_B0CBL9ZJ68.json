                "reviewText": "I am a dog lover and even though I love them, the hair gets everywhere and it can be a chore to keep my clothes from looking as \"pet friendly\" as I am. I decided to give this a try since I hadn't tried it and I was thrilled at the results. A nice light scent that stays with your clothes but it isn't overpowering and most importantly, RESULTS! More hair came off the lint guard than with any other softener I have used. I do wish that this came in a larger bottle is my only suggestion. Very happy!",

As much as I have tried other scents and brands, this will always be my favorite esp for the babies clothes, it has that very smooth relaxing scent.I give it 4stars only because of the packaging. I subscribed for this for every two weeks delivery for \u201cconvenient purposes\u201d. I cancelled few deliveries for the past two months since I have only been receiving damaged, leaked(half open and half empty bottles) messy package. Just yesterday, the mail lady had to help me carry the package to my garage cos of the damages. And this isn't the first time. I have called and e-mailed numerous times but there isn't any improvement of the packaging at all. Suggestions were sent to maybe put something in between the bottles to prevent it from shifting during shipment or tape the caps. But, nothing. Everything turned into a complete inconvenient on my end. After I received my last package, I have fully decided to cancel my subscription for these items to save my time and energy.",
