I figured these were worth a try, and to my surprise I actually like them. My clothes are noticeably softer. I wash in exclusively cold water, and they desolve well in my front load h.e. washing machine. I like that they're unscented, because they don't mess with the scent of my detergent or laundry booster. The do say that they \"boost scent\" and I don't notice any change in that sense. They are a little crumbly, which makes them a little annoying to get out of the box sometimes, but they're still better than liquid.",

They are more eco friendly than traditional drier sheets since there is nothing left to throw away. They are easier to use (especially when traveling) than liquid fabric softeners. My clothes don\u2019t feel noticeably different than when I use traditional dryer sheets so I\u2019d say they perform similarly in that regard. There is no noticeable scent to me.

                "reviewText": "Update: After using this product regularly, I had a one-time (so far) faux pas with it. After the washing cycle ended and I began to put the clothes in the dryer, one of my items had a big white gelatinous glob of the fabric softener sheet stuck to the item. Not sure how this happened but it did require an extra scrubbing in the sink to remove it. Hopefully, this is just a one-time event.I learn something new every day. I was well aware of the laundry sheets but did not know about these fabric softener sheets. They work just as well as the laundry sheets and make life much easier. You just throw a laundry sheet (that cleans) and a fabric softener sheet (that softens) in with your laundry load and voila, all done! I love that these are zero waste, no plastic bottles or anything left over except for a box that can biodegrade in the compost easily. There's also no pouring of liquids which sometimes makes a mess. The only thing that could be improved is that they all stick to each other in the box and it's hard sometimes to just pull out one. Glad I found this product that works just as well as its liquid counterpart.",

I typically have big loads so I end up using one whole sheet each time and my clothes come out softer and fresher.Since these sheets are unscented, it does not add any scent to the clothes. These sheets are a wonderful addition to my laundry.",

They dissolve and add softness while the clothes are going through the wash cycle. I found them very easy to use and they did make my clothes feel nice. I would\u2019ve preferred a little more scent. The box says that there is a scent booster in there, but I find these to be very, very lightly scented. But they do work well, and I would likely buy them again.",

                "reviewText": "I'm so happy that fabric softener sheets that go in the washer are finally available! No more messing with carrying heavy plastic bottles home from the store, no measuring, no spilling, and no need for dryer sheets anymore either. These fabric softener sheets are unscented, but they still have a light fresh smell. I love being able to toss a sheet into the washer along with a laundry detergent sheet, and everything dissolves well and without leaving any residue behind. My clothes come out soft and less wrinkled when using these sheets and there's no waste to go to the landfill. These are like laundry sheets in that the number of uses you get will depend on the size of the wash loads you run since the directions call for 1/2 sheet for small loads, a full sheet for regular loads, and two sheets for an extra-large load. The next time I take a trip it will be easy to pack these along with some detergent sheets in a baggie for doing laundry in the hotel. Easy to use and work well!",
