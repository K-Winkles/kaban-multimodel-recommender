What it does is leave a great fragrance that lasts on the clothes for weeks. The color of the pod doesn\u2019t make a difference in the scent, it smells wonderful.

                "reviewText": "I've been using Snuggle fabric softener (liquid and sheets) for years and years and I'm a HUGE fan. I finally decided to try the scent boosters. I chose Lavender & Vanilla Orchid scent with 56 scent booster pacs. They come in a plastic box, convenient for storing. The directions couldn't be any easier-add a pod to the washing machine drum prior to adding the laundry, then add detergent like usual. That's all there is to it! The plastic wrapping on the pacs dissolve in the water as does the scent booster. Laundry is left smelling wonderful and not at all overpowering/gagging.I've experienced no issues whatsoever. Love these booster pacs and the way the laundry smells. The price is VERY reasonable. (I signed up for Amazon's 'subscribe and save' and got a nice discount on the booster pacs.) They can be used in any type of washing machine. Absolutely recommended!",
