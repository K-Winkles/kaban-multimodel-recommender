                "reviewText": "Great clean scent, but I would not describe it as lavender. To me, it's more like \"fresh\" (outdoors-y). But I like it a lot. I used this on a delicate load containing a couple of wool items, just as I would have used Woolite (cold water, delicate cycle). Results were fine . . . nice fresh smell, soiled collar came out clean, and no apparent damage to the clothing. I do have a criticism on the labeling: The label says to use \"one scoop\" of detergent per load. Huh? This is a liquid detergent with a flip up squirt type cap (I just guessed and squirted in about an ounce on my small load). There is no scoop. And no discussion whether this \"scoop\" was for a small delicate load (like mine), or an extra large one. And an additional comment: Be not mislead . . . despite the marketing claims of \"natural\", the ingredients list contains an extensive list of unpronounceable chemical-like words. But the bottle labeling does claim, \"hypo-allergenic\". I like that (I've had some skin reactions to Tide). So far, I like this detergent.",
