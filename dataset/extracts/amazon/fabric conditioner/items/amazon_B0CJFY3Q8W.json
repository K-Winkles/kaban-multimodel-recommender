                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Work very well, reduced storage space needs",
                "reviewText": "I have used this type of product for the past year or so. I actually switched to this type product for a combination of reasons: takes up less storage, and can be used in both regular washers as well as HE washers. For me these two reasons were significant factors as I have a vacation condo that is tiny and storage is at a premium, AND the on site washers require HE detergent. I love the reduced storage need at my main home as well, so all of these things lead me to try this type of product. But, the bottom line is \u2018does the product work\u2019??? And the answer is yes! One caveat: I wash for three older adults, so significant stains aren\u2019t typically a problem, although sweat and sweat stains are. The products are easy to use - just toss in however many sheets you need and go. There is a catch: I find the ads for this type of product a little misleading because they typically advertise some very large number of \u2018loads\u2019 you can get - which are accurate EXCEPT for the fact that they apply to very small loads. In generally you have to use 2 or more sheets (depending on load size and how dirty the load it). So, just know that you are likely to get roughly half of the advertised number of loads if you typically do large to extra large loads. Still, I find the price reasonable even under those conditions, and especially considering the much more convenience storage issue (as well as being much easier to pack for traveling needs). One tip I will give: if you have extra dirty clothes, or perhaps extra smelly/sweaty clothes, I have found that starting the washer and letting it agitate for a few minutes, and then letting it sit/pause for about 15 minutes, and then start it up again that it really improves the effectiveness. I attribute it to the way the plant enzymes work on the dirt/stains/smells which might be a little different than regular detergents. Finally, the smell is very nice out of the box\u2026 very little smell post-wash though. Overall, I am very pleased with the product!",

                "reviewText": "I like to travel but don't like to pay for laundry on the go, or check a bag. So these detergent sheets will come in handy for my adventures. I did a trial run at home with the washer so see how they performed and was pleasantly surprised.I had been told that detergent sheets tend to leave a soapy/white residue on the clothing but I experienced none of that (load of sheets, load of dark-colored clothes). For a front-loading machine, the manufacturer recommended tearing up the sheet (I used a whole sheet) and putting it in the detergent cup, which is what I did. There was a tiny amount of residue left in the cup after washing, which I imagine could create an issue if you were using this with a top loader (the directions for that option state that you should just lay the sheet on top of the clothes). The scent is a pleasant, but not overly strong lavender. My clothes smelled clean upon exit from the washer (still a slight scent remained).Overall, I would recommend and may even start using these for routine use. The price is in line with liquid detergent and there is very little waste. Taking off one star for the sheets not dissolving fully and the potential for residue....but if I could take off a half star, I would.",

                "reviewText": "This stuff is a marvel of modern technology. It looks like a slip of Styrofoam yet it dissolves in the washing machine and cleans your clothes just as well as any other laundry detergent. It also makes your clothes smells like \"fresh linen\", basically the same scent other detergents call fresh linen. It's a nice fresh smell.It's also nice that it comes with a travel sized package, making it easy to take to the laundromat or if you go on vacation. You can then just reuse the box by putting more from the large box into the travel box. A shame it's just another cardboard box instead of something more durable and reusable.The only complaint I have is them claiming this is 270 loads. While it's true that it is 270 SMALL loads, most people wash up a regular sized load, and that takes 2 sheet parts, so it's really 135 loads...And honestly, for that MSRP, 135 loads is a really good deal. Not sure why they feel the need to inflate the number of uses for the average person.",

                "reviewText": "I never thought I would like laundry detergent sheets like these, but I am newly converted! These detergent sheets are so clever with their small size and negligible environmental impact. I love how easily the sheets dissolve in the wash. I was skeptical that they would dissolve completely, but they have each time I\u2019ve used them. The scent is light and fresh which I really like. I can\u2019t stand overpowering scents at all, so the lightness of the scent works for me. The sheets are small but do a surprisingly good job cleaning. I have only washed smelly laundry so far as I haven\u2019t had anything that\u2019s been dirty or stained. I like that these are easy to travel with and, unlike with liquid and some powder detergents, there is no mess! I highly recommend this excellent laundry product to everyone!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this product because I like to take laundry sheets with me when I travel (when I'm doing laundry in a hotel). I like that they are small and portable and, because there's no liquid, they can easily make it through TSA security checks. If you were doing laundry in a laundromat, these would be very convenient. You can also use them for handwashing.I tried out these sheets on a batch of laundry at home; the instructions are clear to help you determine how many you will need and where to place the sheet for the type of machine you are using. The sheets can be used with a variety of water temperatures. The clothes came out clean, with no trace of the detergent sheet in sight. I really couldn't smell the detergent (it's not heavily scented), but the clothes smelled clean (didn't smell dirty) and that's what's important.I took off one star because I have used other travel laundry sheets that are a two-in-one (washing detergent and fabric softener/static reducer). You put the sheet in the wash and transfer it to the dryer. With these, I think you still need a separate dryer sheet, so now you're packing two things to do laundry when you travel instead of one.",
