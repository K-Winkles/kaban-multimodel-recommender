                "reviewText": "A family member gave me some vintage, high-end shawls and scarves, and I wasn't sure how I was going to clean and freshen them after they had been in storage for so many years, many are dry clean only. Even after spreading them out flat in my laundry room to breathe for a few days, they still had a bit of a \"dusty closet\" smell, so I tried this spray on them. Not only did it remove the dusty smell, it made the fabrics smell nice and fresh! The spray smells strong at first, but fades to a gentle fragrance of lavender and vanilla- one of my favorite combinations. The spray comes out in a very fine, even mist, and it has not left droplet or dark marks on the materials.I am very happy with the scent and effectiveness of this fabric refresher spray, and it's very useful to me for my vintage clothing collection.Outback Gold Wool, Linen, Fabric Refresher and Deodorizer Spray, Scented with Natural Lavender and Vanilla Essential Oils",

I'm chemically sensitive and there's a lot of products on the market that I just cannot tolerate in my home but so far I'm having no issues with this. I looked up all the ingredients and nothing looks concerning according to one of the leading environmental group websites. I believe the active ingredient is the zinc which is also sometimes in deodorants. It also contains some essential oils and even though it's very faint it does have a little bit of a fragrance to it. So I would say if you're sensitive to fragrances it's okay but if you're ultrasensitive then proceed with awareness.Ingredients as listed on the label:WaterPropylene GlycolZinc RicinoleatePolysorbate 20PhenoxyethanolLavender essential oilVanilla essential oilPeg 75 Lanolin",
