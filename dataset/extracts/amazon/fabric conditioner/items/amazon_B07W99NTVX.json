                "reviewText": "Downy sensitive scent free, dye free, is the only kind of fabric softener I will use. There is no scent which is great. Since using sensitive products I have tried everything. Some still has a scent or a dye that irritate, sometimes it takes a couple washings. If having no scent or dye isn't great enough, my towels feel softer than hotels, and fluffy. When I switch, if I can't find the Downy, it sometimes feels like the clothes were hung on a line outside, with no wind or shook out. If you have never been blessed to hang outside, sometimes the clothes can be stiff and rough. If you're wondering if you should get it, I would say absolutely. And the concentrate of anything I still use alot but I don't need to with the Downy sensitive and still soft, no static, and no scent. Great for hunting also",
