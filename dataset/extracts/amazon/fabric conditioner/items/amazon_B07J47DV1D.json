I am highly sensitive or allergic to most chemicals/fragrances (in what often feels like everything including 98% of the laundry products out there). My clothes were like cardboard and full of static for a few years since I couldn\u2019t find anything that didn\u2019t send my body into a tail spin. Then I found this softener and have been using it for about two years now. I scent it myself with a certified therapeutic grade essential oil. Usually 15-30ml depending on which one, so bottle will overflow if new. Better to add some to old bottle first or do a few loads and add oil directly in wash till there\u2019s enough room in bottle for the oil. Problem with my clothes cleaners is over and I get to choose my own scent with each new bottle :)",
