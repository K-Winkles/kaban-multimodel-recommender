                "reviewText": "I like the natural plant-based ingredients, but to be honest, if this product weren't better at removing detergent residue, wrinkles, and other biproducts of hard water, I probably wouldn't have continued buying it after trying it once.I had been using fabric softener dryer sheets instead of a liquid because my older washer didn't have an automatic dispenser. When I got the new washer, at first I tried a different liquid, one I'd used in the past. It sort of did ok, but my towels would lose some absorbancy or some items just didn't feel like all of the detergent was rinsed out, probably due to our hard water.From the first time I used this, I noticed the difference in the softness of everything I washed, not just the towels. The scent isn't overpowering and I don't get itchy skin when I've been perspiring after working in the yard.In addition to being plant-based, this is the best fabric softener I've used and everything smells lovely, so it would be foolish NOT to keep using it.",

I\u2019m not a big fabric softener person but I like to have all my products matched, lol. So when I want softener this is my choice. I\u2019ve researched pretty much all the other brands that offer lots of starter kits, tablets, pretty containers, and just about anything \u201cclean\u201d you can think of! After my eyes start crossing from so much info and so many choices, not to mention the overall cost, I always go back to my Myers Lavender- lol! Others \u201cmay\u201d be better for the environment and our health but I haven\u2019t seen any solid evidence of this yet. For the price I think Myers has a pretty solid track record and they\u2019ve been around a lot longer. Just my opinion! :-)",
