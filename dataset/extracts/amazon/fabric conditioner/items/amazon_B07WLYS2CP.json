But Downy Fabric Softener smooths and strengthens fibers to protect clothes from the damage of the wash, helping them maintain their shape. By smoothing fibers, Downy reduces the friction between them that causes them to break and leads to pills and fuzz. And when fibers break, colors appear duller, so using Downy also helps keep your clothes from fading.",

That\u2019s why you should use Downy Fabric Conditioner to protect the fibers from damage, keeping them intact longer, reducing pills and fuzz on your favorite clothes. How Downy protection works during the laundry process When Downy Fabric Softener is added to the rinse cycle, it conditions every fiber to help protect your clothes from stretching, fading, and fuzz. We put a GoPro in a washing machine What really happens to your favorite clothes during the laundry process? We put a camera into a washing machine to find out first-hand. Downy protects against stretching Your clothes go through a lot during the laundry process. The average top-loader washer thrashes your clothes 3000 times every wash. Protect your clothes from stretching out of shape with the fiber level protection of Downy Fabric Softener. Downy protects against fading The friction and heat from the laundry process can damage fibers, in fact some dryers on medium heat can reach temperatures hot enough to cook ribs. This fiber damage can dull the colors of your favorite clothes, so use Downy Fabric Conditioner to protect your fabrics from fading away too soon.",

I have found that most of the fabric softeners onto market today are a thinner \"viscosity\" and simply do not work as intended in my machine. The \"thinner\" fabric softening products will seep out of the reservoir before it is their \"show time\" thus diluting the detergent and not being there to mix with the rinse water. May be a fault of the machine design, I don't know. However, for my \"Duet, the Downy Concentrated Fabric Conditioner works. And it works well. It leaves a pleasant aroma and actually \"softens\" the clothes. The \"thinner\" products just simply do not seem to work. This is a reliable product which does not disappoint in the way it softens the fabric. Familiar scents, reliable performance. Having chased after a few \"glamour\" products I have come back to what is known to work. For the price, its a deal.",

I had to throw both of them away, but decided I would give it another chance. One was good, and the other one was too thick so had to throw that away too. I won't be ordering these again.",
