It lasts for quite a long time, and I have even found that my dirty clothes hamper smells great now just from the items I toss in there. Yes, it may be a touch expensive for what it is, but when you work out how much it costs per load of laundry, it really is not that much. I have only tried the original scent, but I will probably order another scent before this container is empty, just to have a change now and then. In any case, this has now become a regular part of my laundry routine. When I get around to trying a different scent, I will update accordingly.",
