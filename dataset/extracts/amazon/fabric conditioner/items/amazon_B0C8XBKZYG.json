But Downy Fabric Softener smooths and strengthens fibers to protect clothes from the damage of the wash, helping them maintain their shape. By smoothing fibers, Downy reduces the friction between them that causes them to break and leads to pills and fuzz. And when fibers break, colors appear duller, so using Downy also helps keep your clothes from fading.",

Puse aprueba un trapo lo deje afuera donde tenemos a las mascotas y no se le impregn\u00f3 ning\u00fan olor y segu\u00eda oliendo al suavizante!!! Es muy bueno lo remiendo mucho y ayuda a no batallar tanto con el planchado de las prendas.",
