                "reviewText": "There's not much to say about Laundry Fabric softener, but to me smell is the #1 priority so this fits my personal preference. Obviously scents are a very subjective topic, so what I might like may not be what you would enjoy. To describe the smell is something fresh yet calming and relaxing. It's not overpowering either and I would not describe it as \"girly\" or \"manly\" either, a right good in-between that should please the entire family.In terms of a more objective softening capacities, I can basically say this sort of product works by depositing a layer of electrically charged chemical compounds on the fabric which will prevent your clothes to shock you or cling together. On that front, this works perfectly as wellAs a \"softener\" to make the actually clothes or fabric feel softer to the touch, I have not seen any spectacular revelations here. It does what it's supposed to do, but don't expect miracles of fluffness.This is a solid product, it works, it smells good and does what it's meant to do.",

For anyone who's looking to perfume and perfectly soften their laundry: Purchase this item!
