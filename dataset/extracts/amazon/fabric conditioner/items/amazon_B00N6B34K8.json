                "reviewText": "We've been using this stain remover for the past 6 months on our baby's clothes. It indeed removes all kind of stains, from milk, food or poop.Instructions are pretty clear, soak the cloth in warm water and apply the stain remover. Wait 5 minutes and rinse applying soap in the area.I need to say that this is pretty gentle with the fabric as it removes the stain without damaging it, even if you leave the product in the fabric for couple of hours. We used other products before and most of them damaged the fabric if we forgot to rinse after the required time but this one doesn't do that.I would definitely recommend if you have a newborn or baby as it has been super helpful to us. Also, as the product we ordered had 2 bottles, we were able to have one on the bottom floor at our home for emergency stains.",

                "reviewText": "I never leave reviews but I had to so that anyone wondering if this is worth buying or not can know that it DEFINITELY IS. It is my favorite stain remover ever! It removes poop stains from my 2 month old's clothes effectively (he has blow outs pretty often, and anyone with a baby knows how hard poop stains can be to remove especially on white clothes or if the stain has been on there for awhile). I also use it for stains on adult clothes too. Just spray the stain, scrub it in, wash it, and it will come out looking good as new! I can't even tell where the stains were. They say it helps to let it sit for a couple minutes before washing and it's more effective if you treat the stain immediately but I don't always do either (busy mom life) and it still always works really well for me. I also sprayed it on my couch after coffee spilled all over it and there is no trace of the coffee stains (I didn't wash the cushion cover because it's not removable, I just sprayed it a lot and wiped it down and the stains still came out completely). Dreft is my favorite scent, and while it doesn't smell exactly the same as the detergent to me, it still smells amazing and the smell lasts too! I use their fabric refresher and scent booster beads as well. I'm obsessed as you can probably tell by now. My one and only complaint is the packaging of this product, it was leaking out a little in the plastic that it's wrapped in but I couldn't tell where it was actually leaking from and it doesn't seem like there is any less in the bottle...I just wiped down the bottles with a dry towel when removing it from the plastic.",

                "reviewText": "I recommend this stain spray to every new mom, however, I think this stain spray could benefit anyone! This spray has saved MANY white baby outfits, but I was most impressed by it getting a blood stain out of a cotton T-shirt that had been washed and DRIED before I saw it. I sprayed the Dreft spray on the dried blood stain and ran it through the wash again, and the stain was completely gone. This spray has saved me from ruining hundreds of outfits at this point (messy baby\ud83d\ude2c). It is certainly worth it\u2019s price. I keep a bottle on hand at all times now!",
