I adore the scent, and it is a nice way to add fragrance to a load when I use homemade laundry soap. Someone at work, out of the blue one day, said that I smelled like the beach. It took me a moment to realize it was from the laundry fragrance. It is a bit pricey, but 1/4 c. will fragrance a large load of laundry, and the house. I tried the grass scent and did not care for it. The grassy fragrance turned sweet and overbearing by the end of the cycle. I've found that the laundry fragrance has a mild softening effect on laundry that goes into the dryer, but I don't notice much difference in items that hang-dry, aside from the gorgeous scent. It is a small splurge that adds a lift to laundry day.",

I used fragrance free detergent so the fabric softener scent wouldn\u2019t compete with detergent. I\u2019ve used this twice with fluffy bright white towels. Both times they came out with yellowish splotches. First time I though I did something wrong, so paid extra close attention second time and same thing happened, it doesn\u2019t appear to mix well with water and the towel just absorbs the amount dispensed. It does come out when rewashed, so towels aren\u2019t ruined, but certainly a waste of time and money. Additionally the towels failed to hold the scent after dried. The liquid is a thin milky white - the stains don\u2019t appear until after they\u2019ve been dried. I do like the scent and wish I could purchase just the beach days detergent (currently you have to buy in a bundle with softener) I have the pure grass fragrance detergent because that can be purchased alone, that does not cause the staining like the softener does. I\u2019ll review the detergent under that product.",

                "reviewText": "(This is an excerpt from my review of the two-pack)... This stuff is amazing! What it really is is aromatherapy masquerading as a fabric softener! I save a ton of money by making my own laundry detergent (thank you Pinterest!) but I miss the wonderful scent my laundry used to have. I used to love doing laundry just because the scent made me feel so good but then without any scent it just became a chore, which is probably why my laundry was always piled high in the laundry room instead of neatly folded and hung up each week. So I searched for a laundry fragrance and since the Good Home products were all I could find I decided to give it a try. This Pure Grass scent, in my opinion, doesn't exactly smell like fresh cut grass (I think it smells better!) but it does smell incredibly fresh, clean and bright the way laundry should smell. When I get my last load finished I end up wishing I had more to wash! I've been able to stay caught up on my laundry for two weeks in a row now (a feat I would normally accomplish only a few times a year). It also made our front yard smell incredible when the dryer was going so I've decided that doing laundry just before guests arrive is not a bad idea. It's a scent that makes you think of summer breezes wafting in through the white-curtained windows of a charming English cottage with flowers planted all around and birds singing and bees humming. And the fragrance REALLY lasts on the clothes, too! In the morning when I woke up and lifted the covers off of me the scent on my pajamas hit me like they were fresh out of the dryer! Get this stuff and you'll be in heaven and you'll never put off doing your laundry ever again! I also will put about a tablespoon or two of this into a spray bottle of water and use it to freshen linens and even spray it on my carpets, curtains and furniture to freshen up the house and it's great as a spray to use when ironing. (You can save money by buying directly from the Good Home website, especially if you are a first time customer because you can save 15% -click the coupons link to get the code. They also give free shipping on orders over $150. I ordered two cases as a first time customer and ended up paying twenty-five dollars each instead of the 35-40 here on Amazon.)",
