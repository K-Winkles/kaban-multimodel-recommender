I decided to try more natural laundry materials after having an allergy test recently that led to me getting an epiPen and being given a long list of things I am mildly to severely allergic to.So far no reactions here, which is awesome! Before this I was using All Free + Clear which is the closest I\u2019ve come to a laundry product that doesn\u2019t make me itch. But I like that this option is not only better for me but better for the environment too.The smell is nice, not overpowering, although I\u2019d argue it\u2019s more of a flower smell and less citrus. It is very light (or thin), less thick than the Downy I\u2019m used to pouring. My package was wrapped tight when it arrived so no spillage there.The only thing I\u2019ve having issues with is this. The bottle suggests you shake it before pouring. When I do it\u2019s like a bunch of softener gets trapped in the cap area and overflows the moment I open the lid. This happens even when I choose not to shake the bottle, so I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s a design flaw.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this to compliment the wonderful laundry soap that doesn't leave all that much fragrance. I'm already using dryer balls which do a great job keeping static down, preventing wrinkles and making my clothes soft so I figured this might just do the truck to add more fragrance and soften everything a little more. Well, after more than half a bottle I can report that the clothes have no more fragrance than when using just detergent alone and the differences is exactly the same as if I didn't use it.",
