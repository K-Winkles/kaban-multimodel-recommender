I try very hard to keep my new fabric sofa covered and in shape. My golden retriever loves to get on the sofa and commence to licking her paws which has left some saliva stains on the sofa. I used this product right away and removed the stain. My other pup left a mud print on the sofa and again, I removed the stain. I did however left the mud to dry so I could brush off before I used the product. My worse case was shortly after we bought our sofa. After having a color war with chalk bombs, my granddaughter came in and laid on our sofa. I had bright pink chalk that covered it! I was mortified, but my son thought nothing of it. After they left I gently cleaned every inch with this cleaner. Some I left to dry for another pass the next day. I did get it all out and then scotch guarded the fabric again for protection. I was impressed and my husband wasn\u2019t throwing fits all day!",

I had a small sample bottle of this product and immediately used it according to the instructions on the packaging. The result was that it looks like it never happened! So I bought a full size bottle to have in case something like that happens again.",

It works to get daily dirt and smudges, but the best part is, it works to get ink, chocolate, and so much more out. 10/10 recommend this product.",

The most amazing part is it magically got ride of the water stains left from previous cleaning experiences that I had tried my best to remove with other cleaners. It also dissolved ink in moments after applying. Will buy again and have already recommended to anyone I know with children.",
