                "reviewText": "Wow! I am beyond amazed at these laundry products! I was hesitant to buy them because of the cost but I really love having my clothing / bedding / linens smell nice and never get a good scent with grocery store products.I bought the Australian Sandalwood scent in pods and scent booster. It is an AMAZING fragrance that is hard to explain but I could smell it all day and be in heaven. As soon as I got them, I immediately did a load of a sheet, two pillowcases and some clothing. You can smell the scent as soon as you open the packages. I added a pod and a bit of the scent booster to the load and washed them. When I took them out I was so happy that they totally smelled of the Australian Sandalwood scent. It was strong but not too strong. Do NOT believe others on here that say there is not much / any scent. I don't know what they are doing but that is not the case at all. Even after drying I could really smell the scent on all of my laundry.I put the sheet and pillowcase on my bed and immediately wanted to get into it and snuggle. It is just such a great smell and it lasts for a long time. I use it for all of my clothes, towels, bath rugs and bedding. I can't help it - I just want everything to smell like it.My clothes came out super clean and super soft, even without using any laundry sheets. I didn't want to ruin the scent so I skipped my usual dryer sheets. I actually ended up going to their website and buying the matching dryer sheets and softener. I wish Amazon offered the entire line of products as they are slightly cheaper on Amazon and the shipping is overnight compared to about 5 or 6 days from the company website.I also washed my 16 year old son's bedding and clothing in LS and even HE loves the scent. Now he asks me, as I am collecting his laundry, \"mom you are using that special stuff on it right?\".. I was so surprised that a teenager boy would care about this.I will never be able to use anything else now. This would make an amazing gift for that \"impossible to buy for\" person. I highly recommend. Try it, you won't be sorry!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Luxurious Laundry Sauce",
                "reviewText": "Wow! Well first off, the packaging and presentation is gorgeous and modern. Unlike you typical jug or plastic tub of pods, this looks fancy sitting on my laundry room shelf. The pods in the black box look like golden jewels of amber. And the scent even when I\u2019m not washing clothes makes my laundry room smell so good. Ok, on to the scent. I picked Australian Sandalwood. I was unsure what to expect, but to my surprise it smells amazing! It\u2019s a scent unlike any other. It is slightly more of a manly scent, but not overpowering and still has a bit of a clean soapy smell to it. You can definitely pick up every bit of the scent profile that is listed for Australian Sandalwood. Onto the wash. First load I did with the Laundry Sauce was some throw blankets. I used one pod, a small sprinkle of LS scent booster beads, and about 4-5 throw blankets in my top loader. As the wash began the aroma of Australian Sandalwood wafted thru the air. When the cycle was complete, I took the clothes from the wash and put in the dryer. Omg, they smelled good and looked very clean. Started up the dryer and the scent went thru my entire downstairs. And on my patio where the dryer vent is smelled amazing and I am sure that lovely smell drifted thru the neighborhood. When throw blanket were dry I took them out and you could totally smell the Laundry Sauce. So, don\u2019t believe the other reviews when they say there is no scent left after drying or very little. They must be those that dump all kinds of scented softener and half a jar of scent needs in a normal load and end up smelling like they took a bath in it. Ever have those people at work that walk by you smelling so strongly of scent booster? Yeah, nobody needs to be smelling that strong. Well LS still leaves a powerful scent on your laundry but yet not overwhelming to where it makes you smell like you used scent boosters as a body wash. 2 weeks after washing the throw blankets that are used almost daily I can still smell the LS on them. Even washed my dogs dirty stinky blankets and they still smell clean. This scent is unlike no other and definitely smells classy and rich. Yes it\u2019s expensive but if you want something different that works well at getting your clothes clean, this is it! I won\u2019t use it on my everyday loads of wash, but definitely on any blankets, bedding, bath towels, and some of my nicer clothing items. I have a son soon to go off to college and I plan on buying his the pods and booster to take with him so he can smell great everyday. Even if his clothes don\u2019t get washed very often like the typical college student. I was highly impressed by LS. I do wish they also made dryer sheets that would come with the bundle. I was worried about using my typical Bounce dryer sheet after washing a load with LS, never know if the scents might mix and smell bad,but it didn\u2019t effect it at all. The Australian Sandalwood was the scent that stuck to it. This bundle would make a great gift for someone who likes bougie things and is hard to buy for. Definitely recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I loved the packaging and how well it was packaged! It's beautiful and sustainable. It's like opening a treasure trust full of delightful smells. The scent is perfection. I ordered the rose scent and it was light and flowery with none of the synthetic smells that you get from cheaper products. It smelled like a bouquet of roses. I used one laundry pod per load of laundry and my clothes came out clean and delicately scented. The smell lingered for days but it was not an overpowering odor. I used the in wash scent booster on a load of small rugs and my house smelled beautiful for over a week. Again, the scent was not overwhelming. I am excited to try the other scents.",

                "reviewText": "I guess these work in terms of cleaning power. No real added scent using the pods only. I\u2019ve even tried to throw three pods in there just to see. I\u2019m allergic to Tide, so these pods have not made me break out. I love the scent booster. The Egyptian Rose scent is amazing. I\u2019ve only been using a little of the scent booster and I\u2019ve already ran out. Wish I could buy it separately. This is pretty pricey. Probably won\u2019t be purchasing again. Great scent booster beads though. Again, that joy was short-lived.",

But we found that we had to use two pods or else the scent was really minimal.It\u2019s definitely a luxury purchase. You\u2019re not buying this to save money. To make it last longer, we decided to just use the pods on sheets and towels from now on.I\u2019d like to try out some of the other scents, but I\u2019m scared I won\u2019t like one and be stuck with the entire box of pods and beads. I wish there was some sort of 5pack sample.",
