                "reviewText": "Finally!!! I was wondering when they would come out with fabric softener sheets for the washer. I've been using laundry detergent sheets for months, and I love that I no longer have to store those big plastic jugs. Now I can get rid of the liquid softener jugs. If you're limited on storage space like I am, this is a huge deal.No more measuring either. Just pop them in at the same time you put in the detergent sheets, and forget about it. These sheets are lightly scented, but it wasn't noticeable when taking the clothes out of the washer. The clothes were static free when they came out of the dryer, but I will note that I also use wool dryer balls to speed the drying process and they also help with static control.These sheets, just like the detergent sheets, are perfect for travel. If you live in a dorm or apartment, or if you take your laundry to a laundromat, you will lighten your load by not having to lug around those big jugs. I'm excited to have found these!",

                "reviewText": "I love using fabric softener sheets in the dryer because they leave a great smell once done, but I was surprised these were using alongside my laundry detergent! I don't know if they do much in terms of making my clothes softer, but it does make it smell great. I try to use these weekly or every two weeks because using them for too long may cause the clothes to not wash well",

I have tried multiple laundry detergent sheets, but this is the first softener sheets I've used but the seconds scent. I think this one has a more pronounced scent than the other that I've used. I like the these and the ease of using them.",
