All homes have their own smell - it\u2019s never a \u2018bad\u2019 smell - it\u2019s just your own. I alleviate that smell by mixing three parts fabric softener and one part water in a water bottle. I lightly spray my clothes just before leaving out and I\u2019ve gotten MANY complements abt how great I smell. I use it in my car and on furniture too. It\u2019s like Febreze but lighter. With the wigs - they\u2019re a fabric (those that aren\u2019t human hair), and to keep synthetic wigs fresh and detangled for weeks longer than they\u2019d normally last, the trick is to use fabric softener. This is my favorite one. I LOVE the smell!!! And I love how it keeps my wigs looking brand new!!!",

                "reviewText": "This is NOT the quality from Snuggle I expect.Have used for years INCLUDING this kind!It's a coagulated, clumpy mess like pouring clabbered milk in the fabric softener release in my washer.AND the SCENT is way off.Almost RANCID.Was such a good deal,got 2!And one more that I CANCELLED! Supposed to be here in 10 days but they don't guarantee a product I AM THROWING AWAY.Amazon, please pull the remaining ones.THIS NO SNUGGLE.Its like the product was added to.AND I tried calling twice the Manufacturer and going to the site PRIOR to this review without any answer except a message that they are all in a meeting???",

The only issue is don\u2019t buy in bulk because after a month or so it\u2019s clumps up and clogs the Dispensers of the washing machine fabric softener area. If you think you\u2019ll use frequently, it\u2019s worth the buy just don\u2019t buy two or three of them and keep on your shelf.",
