                "reviewText": "Howdy, y'all! I reckon I've got somethin' mighty special to share with ya today. This here's my review of the Gain Fabric Softener in the original scent. Now, let me tell ya, this ain't your run-of-the-mill fabric softener. It's like a pure liquid blessin' from the heavens above.First things first, let's talk about the scent. Mmm-mmm! It's like a whiff of that fresh spring air after a good rain. I gotta admit, I love the smell of Gain. 'Round these parts, we can't afford what them city slickers call cologne, so we rely on Gain to give us that extra bit of fancy freshness.Now, what's even better is how this softener treats your clothes. It's like a gentle hug from a long-lost friend. My overalls, shirts, and even them delicate unmentionables come out feelin' softer than a bunny's tail. It even helps with them pesky static cling problems. No more shocks and surprises when I'm out milkin' the cows!One thing I truly appreciate about this Gain Fabric Softener is that it works with all types of machines. Whether it's an old top-loader or one of them fancy high-efficiency contraptions, it gets the job done. And here's a little secret for ya: this formula is made usin' 100% renewable wind power electricity. Ain't that somethin'?But let me tell ya, the real magic happens when it comes to the long-lasting freshness. Thanks to the newfangled aroma boost technology, the scent sticks around for weeks. That means every time you open that dresser drawer, you'll be greeted with that delightful Gain smell. It's like a little slice of paradise right in your closet.And if you're like me, who likes to keep things matchin', you'll be pleased to know that Gain offers a whole range of products. They got the laundry detergent, scent booster beads, and dryer sheets, all in the same tantalizin' scent. It's like a symphony of freshness for your clothes.In a nutshell, Gain Fabric Softener is a little piece of heaven in a bottle. It's got the irresistible scent, the indulgent softness, and it plays nice with any type of machine. So go ahead, treat yourself and your laundry to a taste of the good life. Once you try it, I reckon you'll fall head over heels in love, just like I did.Yeehaw!",

It smells amazing (and I do not have any allergic reaction to this softener or fragrance) It does great job softening clothes, especially tee shirts, sheets, and towels, and prevents them from being filled with static and stuck to one another when removing the laundry from the dryer. Definitely less ironing needed when I remember to use this in the wash.I love the large bottle - I feel this will last me a very long time, and it's less plastic to put in my recycling bins. Items smell really fresh and clean when I use this (in combo with the gain laundry powder).Recommending, great economical size and prime shipping options a great bonus,",
