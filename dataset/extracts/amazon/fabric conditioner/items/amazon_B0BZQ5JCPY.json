It took a few washings to get used to the feeling of the cleaner clothes, and the fact the clothes had almost no scent. It really does work great though. Sometime I do have to do a spot treatment but it\u2019s not anymore often than I would have to do it with Tide. We tried Molly\u2019s first and it also worked pretty well, but had some issues dissolving. Pro tip: put the powder in the bottom of the washer and not on top of the clothes or it will sometimes leave a residue. Overall great product we\u2019ve been using for about 3 years now.",

Going back and forth I ended up putting it down as it seemed a little more than I wanted to spend to try something. Then a lady walked by and said, I know I don\u2019t know you but I wanted to say I saw you looking at that soap and I love it! So I decided to try it\u2026 she was right\u2026 it was amazing! This is the 3rd bag I have purchased now and by the biggest bag! It lasts FOREVER and does an amazing job! I added some essential oil for smell in the dryer with my dryer balls and absolutely and thrilled I did try it!!!",
