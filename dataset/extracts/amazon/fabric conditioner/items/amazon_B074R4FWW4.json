It\u2019s actually a staple in our home and removes even the mustard yellow breastfed baby poo!!!! Wow!!! I couldn\u2019t believe that it works better than Oxyclean and it\u2019s safer for baby\u2019s skin. This product is a must try and I highly recommend it. Never had any adverse effects or skin irritations ever nor has it damaged any clothing. I\u2019ve notice my skin not irritated or dry when I come into direct contact with the product while scrubbing garments. It actually leaves a soft residue on my skin. Win win",
