Do not overcrowd the washer with clothing because they do not rinse well and soap stays in the clothes, breaking down the fibers quickly and making clothes look dingy. Medium loads are better for heavier weight clothes or bedding than packing the washer full, especially for this product, it can leave a white chalky film on black clothing if not rinsed out well. I wouldn't pour it onto the clothes, be sure to put it into the water. GREAT softness no scent at all, It got a little thick after it was open a couple weeks, so I just added some water to the container.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE (Nov 2023):I\u2019m still using this product with virtually no issues. I did have one bottle that was overly thick (not even pourable), but it seemed to hopefully be a one off. I stock up when it\u2019s discounted because it is REALLLY overpriced. Other than that, my only complaint is the same one I have for nearly all Seventh Gen products. Why are there no larger, reduced-packaging refill options??? A supposedly lower environmental impact brand that uses excessive plastic packaging in EVERYTHING it sells? So weird. Dishonest and not economical. (I wish Puracy or Dopps had an unscented softener product.)If this one stops their nonsense greenwashing routine, and starts offering a 2 liter refill pouch, or concentrates for making our own refills at home, I\u2019ll upgrade the review to five stars.\u2014-I\u2019ve just started using this after years of struggle with Downy. So far, I very much like the more pourable consistency of this product. It definitely works much better in my washer\u2019s dispenser. I\u2019ll be interested to see whether, over time, it coagulates into the clumpy and barely usable mess that Downy always becomes. Ugh. Will report back if it does.Also seems to effectively control static and reduce wrinkles, which is really all I want from a softener.Some reviewers complained about the way it smells. If you stick your nose right up to the spout then, yes, it does have an odd, or possibly even unpleasant smell. But that\u2019s not what really matters. The fact is, this stuff has zero odor in the wash, and it certainly leaves no smell on your clean clothes, whatsoever. Just stop sticking your nose in the bottle. LolKnocked off a star for being relatively expensive, and for being a so-called environmentally friendly company that offers no refill options that I can find. So. Much. Plastic.Sigh.",
