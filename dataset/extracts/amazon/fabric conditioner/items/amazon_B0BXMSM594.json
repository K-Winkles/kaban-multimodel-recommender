I have used essential oils, putting a few drops onto these dryer balls to add some delicious, yet subtle scent to my laundry. (Lavender oil for linens, Lemon oil for stinky clothes, like workout pants and shirts and a refreshing Peppermint oil for\u2026 well why not!) I can add whatever scent I want and I know it all natural. My clothes come out of the dryer just as soft and fresh as they did when using the dryer sheets.I would recommend to anyone wanting to save money on their laundry bill. My only regret is that I didn\u2019t invest in these sooner.",

They seem very dense which makes me think they\u2019ll last a long while. I seriously feel they help with static cling. Doesn\u2019t eliminate it (does anything?) but sure helps.",

Appreciate that they are hypoallergenic. and fragrance free. Because of the location of my dryer, I can hear the ball bouncing around in the dryer. Definitely cost effective.",
