Plus, 240 loads in one box should last me a good while. Using them is just as easy as when I converted over to detergent sheets. Just toss a sheet in with your laundry, load and go. No measuring, no drips, no mess. They dissolve quickly in any water temperature, even cold, which is how I do most of my laundry. My clothes come out soft and smelling wonderfully of lavender. It's a light, calming scent, which is perfect. I'm not sure if they soften quite as much as my old liquid softener, but they're close enough. The convenience and ecofriendly factor definitely make up for any slight difference. The box they come in is less than half the size of my bulky plastic jug of softener. They're easy to use, smell great, and leave my clothes feeling soft. Plus, I can feel good about doing my part for the planet. Win, Win.",

I've done several of loads of laundry and I used as instructed- toss them in the washing machine drum at the start of your cycle. This is odd to me. You would think you would add it to your fabric softener dispenser so it goes into the rinse water instead of wash cycle. Maybe it's directions are incorrect but I'm using them as instructed and I don't have any complaints really. These sheets dissolve fully and my towels seem to fluff up nicely. I can't really detect a scent, just clean. Maybe adding these to the wash cycle helps to remove any unnecessary residues? I will continue to use these and check back occasionally to see if directions are changed or if in fact, this is exactly how you use them. These are much easier to store, much lighter, easier to measure and less waste than with plastic jugs. So far, I like these.",

Interestingly, these softener sheets are used during the washing cycle. Traditionally I am used to throwing them in the dryer. It seems to work fine as if it was in the dryer despite it getting mixed in with the detergent. It also doesn't resemble softener sheets as they seem to be very thick but it contains the softener that ends up getting dissolved in the washer. The pack of sheets come in a box that you don't have to remove from as it has a cutout to open and easily take them out as needed. It's a huge pack for 240 loads with a perforated center though I typically just throw one entire sheet in. There's no need to add more softener sheets in the dryer as this will do.",

                "reviewText": "I've been sold on detergent sheets for several months now, but was still using liquid fabric softener...until now!! These are a game-changer - so much less waste, so much easier to store, and work just as well, if not better, than the pricey liquid stuff. I have a front-load washer that has a separate compartment for fabric softener, so I just fold these up and place them in that compartment, and my washer automatically dissolves them into the load during the rinse cycle. They have a nice lavender scent that stays on my clothes after drying. I hope that the price comes down over time, as it has with the detergent sheets.SOULINK Fabric Softener Sheets for Washing Machine, No Plastic Jug Soap Strips, Alternative to Fabric Softener Liquid and Pods, Lavender Scent, Up to 240 Loads$19.99 (Prime), at the time of my review",

                "reviewText": "This is my first time trying out fabric softener sheets that go in the washing machine. I've always used the ones that go in the dryer, but now I can see how these are better. These cause less waste and there is nothing to throw away after the wash cycle as these disintegrate and go down the drain, compared to the ones that go in the dryer, you have to hunt them within your clothes and then throw them away. I have also been using laundry detergent sheets more and more so these go perfectly well with them. I simply have to throw them in the washing machine along with the clothes and that's it. As easy as 1-2-3.",

They are a little pricy when you compare them to the other well known brands. They are only used as a 1 time use, which is normal. My wife uses these in the closets to keep the linens smelling fresh. Bottom line, they work and smell great.",

I like the dry sheets. Very easy to store and use. Since I haven't used these before, I decided to first test on a wash of just towels. I will say, my towels came out a bit softer and better smelling than previously! I've moved on to using a half sheet in every wash now. This is a great value too, with 240 loads worth!",
