NOTHING ever gets the stench of dog urine out of anything ultimately. Until I found this. IT IS AMAZING \ud83d\udc4f!!! It is the ONLY thing I have found to make EVERYTHING not only smell AMAZING, but I can also throw in a few towels to make a full load of laundry and the smell is not transferred onto other fabrics! If you have a bed-wetter, SAME THING. Yes, I use a bit more than normal when washing, but it's because THE SMELL IS AMAZING and I want to smell it ERRRRRYwhere. Legit, do yourself a favor and just buy it. Cheap AF if you buy it on Amazon, too \ud83d\ude01. I'd give it 10 stars if I could.",

                "reviewText": "I love the design of the packaging. I love the smell of my clothes after they are dried and the smell of the softener going into my laundry as well!The spout on the bottle is different from all the others I have seen. This poured neatly and easily without a spill which seems impossible for me normally!The smell just wakes my senses up and is delightful!The smell stays for a good while in my clothes and I feel more confidence giving that hug or being in close quarters.",
