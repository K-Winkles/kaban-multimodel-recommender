I\u2019ve actually started making my own softener (conditioner, white vinegar, scent oil, water), which is my real favorite. But my favorite company-made fabric softener is this sage one. It\u2019s a clean, relaxing scent that\u2019s not floral, intrusive or overwhelming. Not sure that smells have genders but\u2026 for what it\u2019s worth\u2026 it\u2019s truly a gender-neutral fragrance. It stays in the background but when new people come in for a hug, or borrow clothes, I get the\u2026 \u201cyou smell so good!\u201d Or \u201cthis smells so good!\u201dMy one complaint is, I wish they sold it in concentrate form with a reusable pour bottle in which you mix concentrate and water. I don\u2019t need all that plastic to ship water that\u2019s diluting the active ingredients.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely LOVE the smell of this fabric softener and a little goes a long way. I used to be able to buy it at Target but they almost never have this particular scent at the stores. It seems to help with static and things are soft, but honestly, I'd use it even if it didn't just for the clean, fresh scent. When I launder the bedding and crawl in that first night it's like heaven!",
