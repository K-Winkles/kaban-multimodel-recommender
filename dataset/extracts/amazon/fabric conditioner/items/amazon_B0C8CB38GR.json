I use one for laundry detergent and one for mixing fertilizer to water houseplants. These look clean and are very helpful.My only complaint is the height. They\u2019re tall enough that they don\u2019t fit under a typical bathroom sink or close to the detergent area in the washing machine. In the washer I just pour from a bit higher up and it\u2019s fine. For filling when diluting houseplant fertilizer, I use the tub or kitchen sink, depending on what is closest, which works pretty well too. Overall I really like these.",
