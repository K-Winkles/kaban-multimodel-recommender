But Downy Fabric Softener smooths and strengthens fibers to protect clothes from the damage of the wash, helping them maintain their shape. By smoothing fibers, Downy reduces the friction between them that causes them to break and leads to pills and fuzz. And when fibers break, colors appear duller, so using Downy also helps keep your clothes from fading.",

                "reviewText": "I have used scent boosters for probably 7-8 years now, but only reviewing for the first time\u2026mainly because I\u2019ve religiously & adamantly used only natural laundry & cleaning products since my 6 months old daughter was diagnosed w eczema & quickly discovered harsh chemicals made a HUGE difference, but as our washing machine got older, things didn\u2019t always smell fresh, even after super hot water wash. So, w her in her teens & able to instantly identify new irritants, thought I\u2019d try some, & could leave off her items if necessary. If any other parents may be curious out of similar concerns\u2026.I\u2019ve now tried just about every brand of scented laundry additive made, & was a long time gain moonlight breeze fan\u2026.LOVED the scent\u2026sweet w/o being too much, perfumy, or inappropriate for my husband & teenage son, but ultimately found myself using way more than recommended in order for the scent to last. At some point, when my preferred gain was out in the store, I settled for Downy shimmer\u2026.which INSTANTLY became our favorite replacement. The scent lasted much longer & was a nicer pleasant gender neutral scent. Going through several periods of Shimmer being unavailable~w other\u2019s questioning if it was discontinued online, I settled on Spring\u2026it\u2019s quite similar but a little sweeter? Honestly, they\u2019re the only 2 scents I\u2019d found I would even consider!! I came across a small bottle of the Shea Blossom in a store I normally don\u2019t shop for that sort of thing, but it & another were new to me, so thought I\u2019d just take a whiff out of curiosity\u2026.I\u2019m the one smelling every candle on the aisle in Marshall\u2019s & Tj Maxx because ya NEVER KNOW what gem you may find amongst 95%, or more, scents I wouldn\u2019t burn if given to me free~I\u2019m obviously quite picky about fragrances & don\u2019t usually like anything \u2018created,\u2019 like fresh, rain, etc, but also don\u2019t care for fabulous scents that disappear instantly either. Shea Blossom was an incredibly unexpected surprise!!! I wouldn\u2019t say as strong or on the sweet side as Shimmer or Spring, I guess more floral, but an incredibly mild floral\u2026.almost a weak Gardenia. I mean, it is called \u201clight,\u201d but I wouldn\u2019t know if the bottle didn\u2019t say so because the performance isn\u2019t a bit lighter! To me, it\u2019s just a more natural, earthy scent\u2026.idk the right words exactly except, not as forced. Clothes smell exactly as you\u2019d expect coming out of the wash, & occasionally I use a little extra on items that won\u2019t be used soon. **an important note\u2026using a front loader, I often add a bit of vinegar to the softener compartment because it helps loosen dirt, strip odors & softens, while also helping the drum stay cleaner, but it doesn\u2019t affect the scent whatsoever! Smells equally great w or w/o vinegar** Fortunately, the Gain boosters didn\u2019t irritate her skin when using a little less than recommended, & the Downy boosters have not irritated her at all, yet Downy fabric softener has caused mild irritation while Tide sets her skin on fire!!!! Knowing it\u2019s definitely more chemicals than I\u2019ll allow at any other time, I feel reassured it\u2019s not bad enough to require caution, & I get to treat myself to a rare bonus of not worrying when I pull out long stored linens for guests that they may need a fresh wash first (I have actually added small plastic pouches w some beads & w holes punched throughout also in items stored in fabric bins long term to help due to a musty smell infiltrating the closet from the crawl space beneath) I have now solely converted to Shea Blossom permanently & even subscribed to monthly delivery. And, now that my daughter is grown & added her 2nd child recently, she has quite rolling her eyes at my use of natural products & converted herself, though she too has chosen to make an exception for Downy Scent Boosters, though opting for a different scent (I think the Light Ocean Mist), & using 1/2 the recommended amount, which she says is perfect as quickly as items are used/worn & therefore washed often. But she readily substitutes mine when she\u2019s out! Doesn\u2019t use on her 5 months old baby, but has been using for her 5 years old son since 1 or so when she also switched from the Gain brand. Newly tried natural detergents have come & gone due to reactions, but Downy has proven trustworthy & continued to be consistently gentle & non irritating to her highly sensitive skin, as well as her young children\u2019s (the baby sleeps on her sheets, & mine, & has extremely close contact w our clothes. Of course EVERYONE is different, but I would recommend at least trying if you have skin concerns because our experience has been great, & that\u2019s rarely true outside green products! And, if you\u2019re not a big fan of overwhelming or intensely permeating smells, I\u2019d also recommend Shea Blossom, & hopefully you too can finally enjoy a mild fragrance boost that\u2019s typically next to impossible to find",
