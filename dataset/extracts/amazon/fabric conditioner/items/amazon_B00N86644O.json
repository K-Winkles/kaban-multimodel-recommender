I picked up on this product from an internet recommendation for woolen items and much prefer this to Bronners/etc.To be clear, wool always has its own \u201csmell,\u201d probably close to a wet dog out of the bath. This product helps a bit, and does leave some of my scratchier wool items a little softer and more bearable.",

                "reviewText": "I think this detergent does its job cleaning, but maybe because it's supposed to be light and gentle that the fragrance is not so appealing. I thrifted a lot of wool, silk and cashmere for the winter season, and I didn't want to not wash thrifted clothes. I ran the load twice in the washing machine in the delicate setting because the first round had a smell wafting before I even opened the washer. After the second time, it was much better. I think the detergent released/cleaned years old \"dirt\" on some of these hence the smell.",

I thought they had changed the packaging (bottle) only but it turns out they dramatically changed the scent. It is so overpowering and so unpleasant to me that I would get nauseous after entering the bathroom after I had hand-washed my swim suits. The old product worked well but why they don't offer a fragrance-free version is a mystery to me. I will need to switch brands after all these years. If you have any sensitivity to strong artificial scents, avoid this product.",
