                "reviewText": "I really wanted to try this laundry soap when I saw it. What a great idea! No plastic jugs, no messy pouring, great for the environment. I wasn't sure if I trusted it to work well, so at first I used it occasionally for tough things and reserved the old standby for more delicate stuff. As time went on, I used it more and more for most things. But I still use the old standby here and there because this soap is expensive!The first package wasn't too successful as the soap squares became slimy sitting in the opened cardboard package in our laundry room. If your laundry setup is in a basement or damp area, as ours is, you may want to consider a plastic box to store the package in. We tried a ziplock bag, but that's a pain to open and close every time, so we got a shallow plastic container. I know, I know, this negates the purpose of these things, right? Well, at least one plastic box has less footprint than dozens of single-use detergent jugs. And it has to be practical. So that's my compromise. 5 stars for quality and innovation, 3 stars for impractical packaging for a laundry area, and 4 stars for added expense. 4 in all.Update 1/24: For the past 2 months, I bought 2 packs of these per month--and ran out. I will try ordering 3 packs next month. This is using the TruEarth for most of the loads we do, for just my husband and me, about a load a day in winter, when big loads (heavy clothing and lots of flannel) are washed. We are using 1 1/2 strips for these large loads, and only occasionally 1 strip for a medium.Not sure if this is sufficient soap because when they are in the dryer a short time, I can smell a dirty-dishtowel odor from the wet clothes. The clothes aren't extra dirty, so this is odd. I noticed one or two other reviewers noticed a smell, too.That's a lot of expense--about double--compared to the Arm & Hammer unscented we have always bought, and which does a great job. I think we will continue for one or two more months and decide if the extra expense is really worth it. If Arm & Hammer made unscented soap in sheets like Tru Earth instead of plastic jugs, I would buy that instead.",

And, they get the clothes clean, as the strips are ultra concentrated! The price is right and delivery was quick and the packaging was just right. I will by this Tru Earth product for now on- no exceptions. Also, the product is hypoallergenic, paraben-free and phosphate-free. Last but not least, this product is distributed by a company in Midland, MI ... USA!!!",

                "reviewText": "We have been using the TruEarth laundry sheets now for quite a while. When you buy jugs of detergent, you are truly paying for a lot of water in the product. You also need to dispose of all those jugs. Even if you buy the smallest jug of the most highly concentrated soap, it is still a lot that goes to the dump over the years. And not enough of plastic jugs and bottles get recycled.First time my wife heard of these detergent sheets, she was excited. I was skeptical. How is it that we are truly only using THAT MUCH actual SOAP to wash a WHOLE LOAD? Took a bit for me to get used to just one half sheet works for a whole load. We DO sometimes add the whole sheet if we have been working outside a lot.We tried two other brands - she reacted to the first one with skin rashes everywhere. I reacted to the second one with a horrible rash on my feet from my socks. So our next attempt was TruEarth - my wife has super sensitive skin and immune system, while i do not. TruEarth is the ONLY one that has not caused either of us to have a problem. When she realized how neither of us reacted to TruEarth, she rewashed literally ALL our laundry in the first package and ordered more!We chose the unscented, which she loves, and it dissolves easily in warm or cold water in our top loading washing machine. I will say that when our WINTER water comes in and it is SUPER cold, the TruEarth sheets don't dissolve as easily and once or twice they left tiny blobs on a couple of articles of clothing. That was easily remedied by rewashing the load on a short cycle. It was also remedied by ALWAYS making sure in winter we toss the sheet into warm water before starting a whole load. This can easily be done by adding a little hot water into the washer first, pausing the cycle, adding the soap sheet, and when dissolved, switch the load to cold or warm and continue as a regular load. OR you can have a small container of hot water handy (she uses an old quart size yogurt or cottage cheese tub), place a sheet in, load the washer as usual, then dump the dissolved laundry soap into your washer just like you would a liquid detergent.I will say, this is not an issue for just TruEarth. My wife and I had to dissolve all three brands in warm or hot water when it was cold outside. But we DO live over 3,000 feet in the Appalachians and our winter water is LIKE ICE some days.Removing stains: this product is great at removing grass stains, dirt stains from the gardens, spilled foods (grease or oil need extra treatments, but that is normal for us), and even baby spit up. We haven't had to pretreat anything since starting to use TruEarth except for oil or grease stains. Oh, it also removes stench, stink and smells easily, too. Definitely a product we regularly recommend to family and friends.",
