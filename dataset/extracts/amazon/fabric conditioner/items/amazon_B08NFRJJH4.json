We already had a dog and the fur from him alone was becoming a problem but with our kitty added to the mix, something had to be done. I saw these dryer sheets in my search for helpful items to reduce fur around our home and on our clothes. Truthfully I did not have very high expectations but I was quickly pleased by the effectiveness on our clothing. I knew tat the lint was reduced drastically and the fur was reduced & even non existent when removing from dryer but I do not think I realized just how much of a difference these dryer sheets made until I once ran out. I KEEP these in stick now because they have become essential in our household! These are one of my top favorite products ever and I will use them every dryer cycle, without pause.",
