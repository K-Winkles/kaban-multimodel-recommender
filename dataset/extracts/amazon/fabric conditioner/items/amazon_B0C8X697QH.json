But Downy Fabric Softener smooths and strengthens fibers to protect clothes from the damage of the wash, helping them maintain their shape. By smoothing fibers, Downy reduces the friction between them that causes them to break and leads to pills and fuzz. And when fibers break, colors appear duller, so using Downy also helps keep your clothes from fading.",

                "reviewText": "We've been using the CALM scent since way before it was called CALM. i just bought the BLISS because Amber/Rose sounds so wonderful! Well, it smells mostly like artificial Gardenia scent. I don't smell either Rose or Amber. I hate it. But the CALM smells GREAT! Our Grocery Store has been out of it and I will FREAK OUT if it's discontinued! Most Laundry Detergents these days STINK because many brands have been discontinued and now all of them are owned by 2 main companies. They all smell the same; Toxically Sweet/Sour. Ew... At least We still have some nice Fabric Softeners. I wish they would BRING BACK \"SUN\" brand Laundry Detergent!",

But, when I take my clothes out of the dryer, they have a very pleasant, subtle smell to them; unlike those strong perfumed dryer sheets that others sell, these don't stink and offend everyone around you!",

They help reduce static cling and make my clothes feel soft and comfortable to wear. I appreciate that I can use them with any type of fabric without worrying about damage or discoloration.What's more, these dryer sheets are affordable, and the quantity is generous. I don't have to worry about running out anytime soon, and the cost per sheet is quite reasonable.Overall, I would highly recommend these Fabric Softener Dryer Sheets to anyone who wants to add a fresh scent and softness to their laundry without breaking the bank. They're a great value, and the results are impressive.",
