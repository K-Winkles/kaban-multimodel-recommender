                "reviewText": "I purchased these compressed wool dryer balls mostly out of curiosity. As a devout user of fabric softener dryer sheets, I could not understand how these could possibly work. At my first use, I became a true believer. The dryer contained a full washer load of mixed general laundry: underwear, a few shirts, a heavy quilted pillow cover, and towels from the kitchen and two bathrooms. From some recommendation or other, I also reduced the normal medium dryer temperature to low. When I unloaded the dryer, I was delighted to see that the clothes were just warm, entirely dry, and all but one cotton blend shirt was wrinkle free or close to it. The one shirt would require a quick iron touchup. The great results have continued for several months, and I still have no idea how they happen, but they do. The balls themselves are good as new and should easily last for a year or longer. If you are looking to save a little money and do the environment a small favor, I recommend giving this simple solution a try.",

                "reviewText": "These work great. I have officially gone completely natural/toxin free with my laundry as I also make my own laundry soap. I generally wash bigger loads, so I usually put 5 or 6 balls in per load. Haven\u2019t noticed if it cuts down on overall drying time, but my clothes definitely feel softer. My favorite thing to do is put a good amount of essential oil drops right on the balls and throw them in the load as usual - the clothes come out smelling amazing! Sandalwood is the best! Smells way better than chemically dryer sheets for sure. I\u2019ve had the balls for a couple months now and they have held up well, maintaining their shape.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using these dryer balls for 6 months now, and they have replaced my liquid fabric softener. For most clothing, the dryer balls handle most of the wrinkles and static. Of course, as with any fabric softener, the things that need ironing are still going to need ironing, but these dryer balls perform at least as well as the liquid fabric softener I was previously using, but without leaving residue on the fabric. They have also measurably sped up the drying time, presumably because the balls bounce around among the items in the dryer, allowing more air circulation. The dryer seems to run a lot more efficiently with these, even just on the air-dry setting. Highly recommended.",

These 6 balls definitely speed up the drying process, I have much less lint every load and they leave the load with completely dry, a lot fewer wrinkles and no musty odours. Fast delivery, great price, and truly wonderful product! Anything that saves me money, in the long run, is worth buying! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",
