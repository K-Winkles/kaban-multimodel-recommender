The sheets are unscented (no added fragrance), but they do have a very slight smell from the other ingredients in them. This smell disappears in the wash. I used the sheets in the washing machine, just before the rinse cycle. I intentionally didn\u2019t put them in with the laundry detergent as I wanted to test the sheets on their own, without them interacting with the detergent. My laundry came out of the washing machines scent free and with no trace of the sheets left behind. Out of the dryers the laundry was noticeably soft, static free, and had slightly fewer wrinkles than usual. No residue on my clothes or sheets, no stains or discoloration, and no weakened fabrics (this happened once when I was testing detergent sheets). Definitely a better option than liquid fabric softeners, and a more affordable option than fabric dryer sheets!",

                "reviewText": "Soulink Fabric Softener Sheets for Washing Machine (Unscented)The box of fabric softener sheets arrived in a box with perforations that create an opening flap and allow for a tabbed closure. However, it\u2019s a bit awkward to remove a sheet since the sheets are larger than the opening; I had to bend and perforate each one to get them out. I\u2019m also wondering how easy it will be to remove a sheet once the ones above the part of the box connected to the closure tab are gone, since it seems like that might get in the way.The sheets look like laundry detergent sheets, but these are brittle and will break apart, unlike the soft and flexible detergent sheets. There\u2019s not much of a scent to them, so they seem unscented to me even though the vague \u201cNatural Fragrance\u201d is the last ingredient. It\u2019s also odd that \u201cScent Booster\u201d is listed on the box.It felt weird to toss fabric softener sheets (with detergent sheets!) on top of the wash at first, but this is our second brand of these (the other ones weren\u2019t brittle like these), so we\u2019ve gotten used to it. We have a top-loading HE machine, and these worked well and left no residue. I used these softener sheets in three loads of laundry, two loads in eco-warm and one in cold, and it all came out soft and unscented. I used a full sheet (two perforated half sheets) in each medium to large load, which is what almost all our laundry is; we\u2019ll rarely use just half a sheet.I like these sheets for the same reasons I like detergent sheets. These are lightweight, there\u2019s no heavy plastic jug, and they are easier to store. Once we got used to the concept and saw that they worked well, it was an easy switch to make. Made in China",

When using, the instructions are a little vague in regards to how many sheets you should be utilizing. It says that you should use two sheets for 5 lb of laundry, which can seem a little confusing. Overall, besides that little confusion, they seem to work okay. My clothes at the end still felt like they had a waxy residue. After taking out the dryer, I feel like there was more static than compared to when I use a dryer sheet. So, at the end of the day, if you're looking for an eco-friendly alternative, it's worth considering, but it isn't the best that I've seen.",

I would think that the effect would wash away in the rinse cycle. So I was pleasantly surprised that I could tell my towels were softened after the dryer. I can definitely tell what my towels feel like with no softener, so I feel very confident saying that these sheets worked. Super convenient to use and I love the no-plastic bottle aspect. I know that dryer sheets get a bad rap, so if you are worried about the ingredients in those, you might want to check these out, since the clothes get rinsed after being exposed to the product.",

I used these in my front loader, adding the soap sheet in the dispenser and tossing this on top of the clothes. The first run I did was only towels, and later tried clothes after my confidence went up. The towels were surprisingly soft and the scent was the faint scent of my soap, just as I had hoped. The only downfall was that the sheets did tear a little when removed. They\u2019re divided, so you can use half if needed. I would recommend these, and they\u2019re great for folks who don\u2019t like the extra scents.",

The sheets were perforated, so you choose how much you need, according to the size of you load. I had a very large load of laundry, so I used two full sheets, after reading the instructions. The sheets had a very light scent, very pleasant, not heavy with perfume, but light, almost indiscernible. My laundry came out soft and feeling great. There was no scent, but a freshness from the clothes. I really liked the way these performed.What a great product, and so easy to use. Fantastic!",

These sheets are an incredible value. I've used only 3 of 240 (seriously!) and they work beautifully. They dissolve with no residue inside the washer or on clothes and are truly scent-free. I split them up into smaller bundles in baggies to keep them fresh and not \"dry out\". I'm not sure that's necessary, but I did it anyway as it's 240 loads! I love them.",
