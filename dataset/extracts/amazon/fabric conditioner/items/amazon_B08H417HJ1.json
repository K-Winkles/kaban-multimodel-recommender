Though these are pricey compared to other dryer sheets on the market I love that they are made with essential oils, made in the USA, cruelty free, natural, I could go on and on! In fact my husband noticed how good the baby's laundry smelled that we stared to you use these on all of our laundry! Also tip don't throw away after one use! I have noticed the sheets retain their scent after several loads!",

I had to return them because I couldn't even stand to have them in my laundry room. That being said, clothes dried with them were not overly scented. A lot of it seemed to dissapate during the drying process. I think the unscented ones are likely great. I would be willing to try a different scent if they come out with another version.",
