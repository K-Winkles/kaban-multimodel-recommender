I mean this product doesn't come with measuring caps so it's always troublesome and I always end up using more than I need to bcoz it smells so great. But the price is $$$$.So the pump squirts. Like peeing squirt. Liquid also comes out just by tiling the jug, don't even need to pump, it just comes like like a trickle. The pump sticks up high, like a towering flagpole. If you need to close it, then you have to squirt out more. Come on, where's the convince for such a high end product?? I threw away the useless pump. But now I can't find the original cap it came with. So now I have an orange tape, so it's visible it doesn't have a cap, taping it over its mouth.Please? Great product deserves great delivery?",

                "reviewText": "We deal with some pretty hard water here in my area so I wanted to give this product a try. I'd read about some legal issues and recalls on this brand from 2022, but this product is not part of that recall so I am giving it an honest review based on its current status.The smell of the isle version of this fabric condition is nice, it is not too feminine in odor, I'd say its a bit more in the lighter-neutral realm of smells. It does not take much, 1 oz for a normal sized load and it does work really well at softening my clothes. That said, if you use this with each load, you will need to replace it about every 30 washes or so. I have been using it for a couple weeks now and I really enjoy it. I'll be buying another bottle but trying out a different fragrance like their classic series. Cheers!",

                "reviewText": "Really Laundress? I\u2019ve been buying your products for over 5 years and I do approximately 25 loads of laundry a week. 2 disabled kids,3 dogs and 4 cats. The only way I survive all this laundry is, by buying great laundry detergent with a great scent. Now I have no idea what to do. You watered the items down so much. They\u2019ll never go as far as they used to sadly. Which means I have to find another laundry line of products. Two stars, because it stills smells great and did an ok job on my laundry, but to get my laundry super clean. I\u2019ll have to add in other products (stain removers, etc) which will cost me more to do laundry. You raised the price as well. Quality down, price up. SMH. Bring back the original quality, please! I started working on my own line of quality plant based laundry line and it won\u2019t be long before I am able to put it up for sale online and I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s better than yours and it won\u2019t be hard to do now that you have lowered your quality. What a shame. I\u2019m sure you lose a lot of faithful customers that have been with you for years now and you\u2019ll gain some new, but eventually the price and quality will catch up to your products",
