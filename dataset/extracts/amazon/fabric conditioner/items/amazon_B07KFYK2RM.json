The product can be sprayed on the clothing and then washed however this particular dress was not dry clean or machine washable. It did reduce the smell but it took numerous attempts along with hanging it in front of an open window. There seemed to be some very faint remnants underarm odor which is a shame because the dress was very pretty and well made. Also, you have to be careful to not spray too heavily on the fabric or it made leave an outline of a stain. I would definitely use this product again if the clothing was machine washable.",

                "reviewText": "This fabric freshener spray is excellent, easy to use and the fragrance is awesome! It's not overpowering and dries so quickly! I have already found so many items it will be used for! Plus this purchase was a 2 bottle deal! How do you say no to that? Definitely recommend if you want something that dries quickly and just smells great and handles hidden germs too! I will be purchasing more when these bottles run out!",
