It has been several months since the last time I sanitized the unit but I live alone and do laundry once per week. That being said, it's easy to use but not sure exactly what it was supposed to do. Thankfully my washer is working the same, no odors, no residue from the product either so I'll leave it five stars. As always, I end up cleaning the agitator and bleach dispenser areas myself anyway. Don't expect any help with either one with this product.",

Most distressing, my clothes came out smelling like industrial cleaner for several washings afterwardsI was happy to find this fragrance free version, which comes in tablets and consequently as much easier to store less messy to use. Would highly recommend and purchase again",
