                "reviewText": "I bought this product after searching for something to revive my cashmere and woolens after long winters of intensive use here in Minnesota. I chose the lavender scent to keep any unseemly stinks from lurking in the corners of my sweaters, and it imparts a very pleasant and close-to-skin lavender scent that is not too overpowering. While the lavender is nice, I also ordered some cedar oil to add to the wash to keep clothes moths at bay. In fact, my only suggestion for this product would be to offer a cedar oil/scent version of this product because us natural fiber girlies know that clothes moths are no joke. Aside from that suggestion, I am very pleased with this product and chose to view the price as an investment in the long-term viability of my nice sweaters (although of course who wouldn't love to see it cost a little less?).I also threw this detergent straight into the deep end in order to *gasp* wash a leather jacket that I picked up secondhand in Spain that dearly needed a cleaning (the cost of this detergent is small compared to dry cleaning/leather professionals). It didn't ruin the leather and the lavender smell helped mask the dusty smell emanating from years of baking in the Spanish sun, no doubt. Actually, if anything, it was almost TOO gentle for the kind of clean this jacket needed. It is almost fully dry and I am about to foist an absolute army of leather products upon this jacket. I will include pictures for the curious if the jacket rehab does not turn out to be a complete disaster.",
