                "reviewText": "I've tried scent booster beads in the past and although I loved the way the laundry smelled afterwards, the scent didn't last long enough to make the continued purchase worth it in my opion. We went out to dinner with some friends recently and they both went on about these Downy Fresh Protect Beads. Weird topic of conversation maybe, but my friends husband thought they were the neatest thing. My friend sent me a pic of the one they use and I decided to give it another go.For some laundry reference, we have a lot of athletic clothing so I don't use fabric softener or fabric sheets, preferring dryer wool balls instead. I also use a laundry detergent that is fragrance free and helps with skin sensitivities. That may seem odd that I would purchase a product like this after saying that but my issue isn't with fragrance. I love a good laundry smell but a lot of sensitive products are fragrance free. My problem is that I have mild ezcema and some products can irritate or cause a flare up of that. I'm so happy that this one does not.I have been using these beads for a little over a week now and our laundry smells fabulous. The scent lingers much longer than the beads I used before. You can use a little or a lot depending on how fragrant you want your clothes. I go somewhere inbetween. It doesn't cause any staining and I'm not worried about it causing a negative effect on our sportwear. Best part, as stated above, no sensitivities to it! Yay! I now can understand why our friends raved about it. This stuff is fantastic and I will be making this a regular purchase.",
