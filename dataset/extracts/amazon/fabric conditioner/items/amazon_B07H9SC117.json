Using fabric softener in the wash can provide better softness, better freshness, reducing wrinkles, and reducing static cling to the fabrics in your clothes, towels, and sheets. For a top loader washing machine, add Snuggle brand liquid fabric softener during the final rinse cycle or use an automatic dispenser for added convenience. To avoid spotting, do not pour Snuggle directly onto clothes. For a front loader machine, add Snuggle brand liquid fabric softener to the built-in fabric softener tray that is often placed to the right or left of the detergent tray. Safe for standard and HE washing machines. Includes one 96 ounce bottle of liquid fabric softener.",
