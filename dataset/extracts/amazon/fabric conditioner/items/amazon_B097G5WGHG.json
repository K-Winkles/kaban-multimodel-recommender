The bottles took up most of the shelf.I saw these and had to try.They have worked wonderfully. Always dissolving no matter the size of my load. (Though I had seen some comments about these not dissolving.)The laundry room smell fresh from the dryer and laundry sheets. When placed into the wash or dryer the smell become soft barely noticable. I am gratefull because it lets the clothes smell air fresh clean and not chemical or overly perfumed.The dryer sheets provide a softness with oily feeling that many softners leave behind.It was an extra bonus to find 2 products that will not cause my skin to break out due to harsh chemicals.NO Plastic! Great for the enviroment. No mess! Takes up less room! Not heavy to pickup! Fresh laundry",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I\u2019ve tried many fabric softener products. I don\u2019t like dryer sheets and I don\u2019t use plastic bottles. I tried the wool balls, the pods you just throw in the dryer, and fabric softener in a box. The balls are cute but don\u2019t do anything for static. The pods don\u2019t work at all. The fabric softener in the box is great but the one I was using is no longer available on subscribe and save and is very expensive. I watched another video on this product and the woman mentioned the dryer sheets could be used over and over again. I don\u2019t like dryer sheets but decided to try these. First, they smell AMAZING. My laundry is in a small bathroom so the whole room smells so delicious now. Second, THEY ACTUALLY WORK. I put one sheet in a load. Everything came out smelling so good, feeling so soft, with NO STATIC. The sheets feel different than others. I could tell the one sheet I used could be used again. I used it a second time on a larger comforter and it worked great! Soft and NO STATIC. The packaging is recyclable, they\u2019re made with essential oils, they\u2019re vegan, and made in the U. S. The price is great, especially because they can be used more than once. This is a great product. I highly recommend it.",

All I know is that these do not stop static cling. They cling to my clothes and there is static when removing clothes from the dryer. They also have a somewhat unpleasant smell in the box. Coming out of the dryer, clothes smell fine though. Maybe the scented work better, I don\u2019t know, but I usually prefer unscented products. I\u2019m disappointed, because I did like their unscented detergent sheets and found those effective, but will not be buying their dryer sheets again.",
