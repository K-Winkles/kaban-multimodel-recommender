Since 1955, Otaci has been an accomplished brand in the natural skincare, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. We have significantly contributed to these industries through vigorous and innovative Research and Development with the core objective of utilizing nature to make lives better for the humankind. Otaci aims to protect human health through the healing power of nature. Our vision is to be a global brand that heals people with high-quality herbal products inspired by nature. Otaci is the reliable, premium, local and the most honest natural and herbal alternative to the daily ritual of all personal care & cosmetics.

The iconic 10 Herbs Shampoo and Conditioner that revitalizes your hair with its plant oils and extracts while cleansing it from root to tip, giving it a natural glow and a healthy appearance... Our Founder Ph. Niyazi Kurtsan's first formula, 10 Herbs Shampoo and Hair Conditioner, prepared with plants from Anatolia, contains juniper, sage, rosemary, laurel, thyme, lavender, lemon balm, myrtle, mint, and medicinal chamomile, in addition to the precious sweetgum tree, one of the endemic plants of our country.

Laurel frequently grows in the Mediterranean, Aegean, and Marmara regions of Anatolia. Since the oil obtained from bay leaves is a powerful oil, it is diluted in olive oil and used.

I think it's a good conditioner, it has a fairly strong herbal smell when being used, but it rinses out well and the scent is gone. It left my hair nice and soft and easy to comb out while wet. I have medium long, straight hair and finding a good conditioner that allows for easy combing is hard to find. The pump bottle works very well.",

Combed nicely through wet hair & once rinsed, it left hair feeling moisturized. Once dry it felt soft & healthy. It is a nice conditioner that isn\u2019t too heavy and left hair feeling improved. Seems like one that would work for most hair types. I would definitely recommend this conditioner. Reasonably priced too ($8.49 at time of review).",
