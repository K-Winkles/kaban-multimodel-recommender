Despite consistent orders, I've encountered occasional issues with product delivery, suggesting potential shipping challenges. However, if successfully received, this detergent proves effective and offers excellent value. It has become my go-to for washing delicate items on the gentle cycle. A bottle lasts me about 6 months when used about once a week.",

                "reviewText": "Used to hand wash my mother's satin wedding gown from 1952. It was in rough shape from being stored for 71 years! I gently washed and soaked with a scoop of oxyclean and a capfull of this woolite in my bathtub. I knew I couldn't ruin it because it was already in such poor condition (discolored all over and the tulle was stiff). I'm thrilled with the outcome. I've attached a before and after picture - you can see how shiny the satin got after carefully hand washing it. The tulle is now soft and clean again. It also smells clean and fresh. The gown still needs to be pressed or steamed - but now I'm excited to display it on my vintage dress form.",

This keeps them from bleaching, and loosing their color, and breaking down fiber. Won't mention the brand name 100% cotton sweaters and where I buy them, but they ain't cheap.",
