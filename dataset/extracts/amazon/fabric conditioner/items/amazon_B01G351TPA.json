I love the convenience of being able to just toss a pod into the washer with no measuring. I've been using these for years now, and will keep using them as long as they make them. One thing - if you have a front loader, toss the pod in first before the laundry or it may fall forward into the drain/seal area and not stay in the drum area. As long as it goes in first it stays in the drum where it belongs.",
