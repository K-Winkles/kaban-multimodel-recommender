                "reviewText": "For the first 4 months of cloth diapering, I used Country Save HE Laundry Detergent, Powder, 160-Load, 10-lb Boxes (Case of 4) . I have a front loading LG Tronn machine, and I would do a rinse/spin cycle with a smidge of Country Save, then a heavy soiled normal wash on hot with 1/4-1/2 the \"standard amount\" of detergent, followed by one or two rinse and spin cycles. This worked pretty well, until I moved.If there's one thing you'll learn about cloth diapers, it's that your laundry system will be completely different from everyone else's due to your child's body chemistry, your diaper brands, your water quality, and your washing machine. Though we kept the same machines, the water at our new location was incredibly different, and after a cycle or two of washing diapers in the new house, my son's rump was red and rashy! Needing some new laundry solutions, I decided to get Rockin' Green and I am so glad I did.The Smashing Watermelons variety smells wonderful, just like watermelon Bubble Yum gum! Too bad the smell does not stay on the diapers (though I can see how that would be bad for babies with sensitive skin). The Rockin' Green website is brilliant - they have a very informative FAQ, as well as suggested washing cycles broken down by type of machine. Plus the small looking bag claims to last up to 90 loads! One important thing to keep in mind is that when you use Rockin' Green for the first time, you have to be very careful. It will suck the chemical residue out of your diapers, so if you do not run a whole bunch of rinses, your child might get a worse diaper rash than she started off with. If you have particular stubborn residue, stains, or stinkies, do a soak in Rockin' Green. My son's butt is back to being happy, and my diapers look and smell cleaner than ever. My new washing cycle is - delicate cycle with water plus option to rinse the diapers, cotton cycle with water plus and 2 tablespoons of Rockin' Green to wash, followed by one or two delicate cycles with water plus to rinse.If you have hard water, you might need to use more than 2 tbsps, if you have very soft water, 1 tbsp might suffice. If your water is especially hard, use Rockin' Green Cloth Diaper & Laundry Detergent (Hard Rock, Bare Naked Babies) , and if your baby has very sensitive skin, try Rockin' Green Cloth Diaper & Laundry Detergent (Soft Rock, Bare Naked Babies) .",

                "reviewText": "I have been using rockin green for years to wash cloth diapers. It works great and I never have smells or stains in my cloth diapers. I soak my cloth diapers in a plastic bucket with water and vinegar (I throw them in there until I am ready to wash them). Then I use the rockin green detergent in the wash machine with the diapers. Then I hang dry them on my deck. It's the perfect system. I have prefolds that I have had for about 5 years that still are in perfect condition with no smells or stains and still absorb perfectly! I have seen other moms complain on social media mom groups about rockin green saying it isn't good for cloth diapers, but obviously when they have only been doing cloth diapers for a year or less, and I have been doing it for about 5 plus years... Its very possible they are not using it properly. You DO NOT need much detergent with rockin green. My last bag lasted a few months and I wash diapers two to three times a week. The only reason I am knocking a star off is because I do wish they came in larger bags so I could order less often. I have so far successfully cloth diapered 3 out of four children and am going to be cloth diapering my new baby who is due any day now too.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased both this and Funk Rock out of absolute desperation and need for something different and I am so glad I did. With a constant flux of bed wetting and sports clothes that just can't seem to shake their smell, I needed something different. I had tried all of the special off the shelf sport washes, oxy, borax, and vinegar to get out the smells... and they only seemed to be getting worse! I had a small pile of clothes sitting in my laundry room that seemed to be forever ruined. After receiving these, I did a soak cycle of funk rock and a wash cycle of funk rock and classic rock (just 1 Tablespoon each)and to my surprise the smells were gone! No pee smell, no body odor smell, no sour smell on ANYTHING. Everything that came out of my dryer smelled surprisingly and refreshingly neutral. ...and I honestly couldn't be happier. I purchased the lavender mint, which is very light and faint, and like I said, smells neutral/fresh once out of the dryer. No masking with something strong smelling or perfume-y. I tried to use up the remainder of my liquid detergent on my towels, but each time I do, they go back to smelling bad. So I guess I'm just going to have to trash or donate my old detergent. Thank you, these have proven themselves to be subscribe and save worthy!",

I used this first on some white sheets of ours with pretty heavy sweat stains that hang on no matter how often we wash them, and we can't use bleach since there is a pattern on them. After using this and letting it soak for an hour in the washer, the sheets came out clean, no stains what so ever! I've since used this on my clothes and they are cleaner than ever, with no greasy feeling",
