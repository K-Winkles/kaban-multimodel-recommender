They scent was very strong.A replacement was scent out, no leaks or issues, but the scent still seemed strong. I've tried it a few times now, using different amounts, and no matter the amount used the scent hasn't been strong on the clothes. Only noticable fresh from the dryer or later if you directly smell an item of clothing.The scent pink scent is lovely and not too overly feminine. It's a soft floral with a light musk to me. If I could buy it as a perfume I would.",
