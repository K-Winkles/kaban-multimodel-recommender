I have always used the smell test to see how clean my laundry is. If I just use 2-4 pods my clothes smell ok out of the washer but after being dried they still smell dirty. I have to use 5-6 pods in my old high efficiency front loader. The clean smell doesn't last very long. But at least what I wear smells ok at the end of the day, and, the towels are ok after one use. I have an 11 year old already very stinky boy and it gets rid of his funk. I was using scent boosters since the other brand also didn't have much of a scent (I used 2 sheets per load of the other brand and at least they didn't smell dirty) but this detergent wipes that out. I like that the container they come in is recyclable cardboard. The sheets came in a lined paper box and we don't have that type of recycling where I live. So I'm questioning the value but I still like it.Addendum: I noticed it works better in hot water. I generally wash in cold or warm, again, to be more environmentally conscious, but in cold this detergent is weak.",

We used the unscented for a while but I caved and tried the scented and I don't regret it. Just a soft clean smell. Does a great job getting out the normal stains but we do use a spot treatment for formula/ blowout stains",
