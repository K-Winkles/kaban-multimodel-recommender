Personally, for me this was a waste of money as this has almost no scent whatsoever. I even increased the amount per wash to see if that might help but it didn't. I will stick with my favorites: Capri Blue Volcano & Tyler Glamour Wash (Diva and High Maintenance scents).",

The worst part is they don\u2019t offer the very best products they used to make like their laundry Detergent No. 10. It was the absolute best. Now their scents are much more bland and nowhere near what the products used to be like. I wish the founder never sold to P&G, all they\u2019ve done is ruin a great, valuable brand.",
