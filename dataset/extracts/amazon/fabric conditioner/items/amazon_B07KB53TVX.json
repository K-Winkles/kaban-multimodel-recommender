Cleans well, and leaves wool soft. Some of the clothes from the same load still have a very light scent after drying, and others don't, which is odd, since they're all 85% wool and I swished the Knit IQ around in the water before adding clothes. Pure wool shirts smell like nothing after drying.Scents are hard to describe, but I'd call it a little spicy and almost woodsy. I don't like \"girly\" scents and I love it. I think most guys would like it too, unless they don't want any scent. As I mentioned, it is very light to non-existent after drying.I'm glad other reviewers warned about rust on the spring in the dispenser top. I would hate that, since this stuff isn't cheap. I put it into a different bottle as soon as I got it, to avoid that. The \"3 pumps per gallon of water\" would be convenient, though.",

                "reviewText": "I typically work with super bulky wool that sheds like crazy while I'm working with it- a few rows into anything and I have stray hairs ALL over my face. The final product is always soft, but a little scratchy and you'll see a little fuzz 'glow' on things like beanies.The first piece I used the soak on is a big bulky wool blanket that was knit fairly tight and was shedding like my Shiba all summer. I soaked it in KnitIQ for an hour or so and rinsed it a few times. OMG I had no idea wool could soak up SO much water! I almost fell in the tub trying to pull the blanket out. After rolling the blanket up in several towels and a few days of flat drying/loose blocking, the fibers of my blanket relaxed and became more sturdy- this is now the softest, most comfy blanket in the house (that definitely does not shed).At first (because the soak has lanolin and I used 100% wool) it definitely smelled like some funky sheep rolled in some lavender and mud. After the blanket dried, it's had a lavender citrus scent that seems to last forever. I think I washed it 2 months ago, we use it everyday, and it still smells freshly washed.I've also used to soak to wash a small bit of clothes to see how it works on fabrics like cotton. You don't get the 'funky sheep' smell and it does a really good job of cleaning. You just let it soak, and you don't need to agitate the water. The scent doesn't last as long- I assume the scent binds to the lanolin.Aside from being great for wool items and hand knits, I think this soak is a great option if you're traveling a lot or you're having washer problems. If I moved into an apartment that required me to use communal pay machines again, I would totally use this wash for smaller wash loads to save money, for sure.UPDATE: I\u2019ve used this wash on other difficult to wash items and it\u2019s proven to be an amazing stain lifter! I soaked my wrist braces (with metal supports in them) overnight. They had paint stains on them that were years old, so I didn\u2019t expect anything special. The paint was gone the next day! I\u2019ve also been using the soak for my white fabric face masks overnight- makeup comes right out without scrubbing or bleach :)",
