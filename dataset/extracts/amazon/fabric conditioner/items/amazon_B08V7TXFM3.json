                "reviewText": "Ya'll I live in the county and we have well water, which is known to have the hardest water in my state. The water is so hard that it causes our dishwasher and laundry machine to break down faster. Needing a laundry soap that is built to handle hard water is crucial, otherwise your clothes do not get clean and you can feel a residue on them. I bought the dish washing spray when it was on sale at my HEB and it worked great. I bought the dish soap to use outside to wash my chicken feeders-as it's eco friendly and we do have a well. It cleaned scum off those feeders fabulously to my surprise. Was not so eager to try it on my dishes, I thought green meant it does not clean as well. We ended up changing our lifestyle later on and introducing clean products and I found out this was one of the FEW clean laundry soaps out there and when I found out it was designed for hard water-I had to try it out. The price was right, much cheaper than tide and for having clean ingredients-this price is a score.I did not have to use as much cleaner, I noticed after the first load. I put it to the third line and it did not rinse, then I used less (1st line) and not only was there no residue, it was clean and my clothes smelled so clean, the scent was not overpowering. It smelled like how your clothes smell fresh from drying in the sun on a line. My clothes have not felt this clean in awhile. It got out stains and it was gentle on our clothes and bedding. I went and made another purchase three days after purchasing my first, incase the price go's up-it usually does when people find out how good something is.With all the crap in everything now days, it's terrible to walk around in clothes washed in toxic chemicals that cause everything from infertility, hormonal problems to cancer and people are none the wiser. Your body is against these chemicals all day and your skin is just soaking them up and people wonder why they are getting sick. It is wonderful that we now have options instead of using only what was once available at the time. I would highly recommend this product, not only for the cleaning power and how well it tackles hard water, but for the health of you and your family.",

                "reviewText": "I was using another readily available brand of BLUE dish cleaning spray because I liked the novel manner of dispersing a spray onto heavily soiled pots, pans, and baking dishes, thus softening/dissolving stubborn stuck-on foods. YES, the popular blue brand stuff worked great in that it provided easier cleaning, HOWEVER it also emitted a heavy, chemical scent that was negatively affecting my breathing (not to mention the high cost that negatively affected my budget).It was about then that I noticed that the water spots left behind by our well water were positively affected by the use of common household vinegar. The bad news is that vinegar, in an of itself has it's own profound, pungent, and lingering smell. Then, while perusing AMAZON's website, I happened to spy this 9 ELEMENTS VINEGAR LEMON DISH DETERGENT SPRAY. I purchased the 4 bottle/refill configuration and found myself thrilled with the results. The spray function worked well. It clung to and removed sticky foods from various forms of cookware - and did so WITHOUT ANY overwhelming chemical smell. In fact, with the addition of lemon to the cleanser, I couldn't detect ANY vinegar smell at all during use. Our experience showed it was not only effective in cleaning heavy soil from dishes, pots, and baking dishes, but it was also exceptionally effective in cleaning our glass cooktop, countertops, stainless steel appliances, vent hood, and just about ANY other mess I could throw at it. I was so impressed, I just purchased the 9 ELEMENTS LIQUID DISH SOAP. (I'll let you know HOW THAT'S working out as soon as I've tried it.)YES, YES, YES, I am happy to recommend this 9 ELEMENTS SPRAY DISH SOAP (available on auto ship with AMAZON as well as local availability at Harris Teeter markets.)",

                "reviewText": "After moving to an area with super hard water, tons of calcium, which builds up on your skin and your hair, and in your fabrics. After just one wash with this laundry detergent, I had soft \u2013 not scratchy \u2013 sheets and clothing again. It\u2019s really nothing fun about sleeping on scratchy sheets, or having cotton sweaters that itch and won\u2019t stretch. So this was really needed, and it really works. A small amount \u2013 about 3/4 of an inch in the big cup \u2013 is enough for one normal load, in a normal household size washing machine. So it will be pretty cost-effective, it solves the problem, and I always want to use ecology, friendly products, which this is.",

                "reviewText": "Love this product so much!However, the last time I ordered it one of the refill bottles busted open and soaked everything including the box it was shipped in. It created a huge mess and Amazon won\u2019t let me return it per its policy. Requesting a replacement required me contacting 9 Elements via phone call and I don\u2019t have the time to be on the phone for possible hours for one replacement bottle.As I said, love their product but I won\u2019t use Amazon anymore to order it (which is sad because they have good deals!).",
