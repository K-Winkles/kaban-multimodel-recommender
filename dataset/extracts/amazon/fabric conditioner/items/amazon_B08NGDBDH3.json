I started buying the concentrated bottles but found the scent started to bother me so I looked in store for the free and clear. Target does sell the eco box but only in the cotton smell which is awful. The store associate showed me how to check the nozzle to ensure its facing down, and said they just don't carry the free and clear. I got my shipment next day. It was well packaged no leaks. I made sure to pull out the nozzle carefully and even peeked at the bag inside.i washed two blankets for myself and my dog. No scent beyond tide ,and they are fluffy. The eco box takes up less space on my laundry shelf and it is not overly heavy. I am 100% a fan.",

                "reviewText": "I really like the less plastic packaging. Having corrugated cardboard is sooooo much better for the environment & recycles easily in most places.Those who complain about it's use being difficult need to stop for a moment, read the directions and go from there. Once and a while the spout will begin to clog. It is easy to clean, just turn the box upside down, use a small implement (toothpick, chopstick, whatever to scoop the thick bit out. Open the spout and visually ensure the drain area is now clear. CLOSE THE SPOUT or you will make a giant mess. Turn right side up and use as normal.If the spout as gotten gunked up, your machine may have too. If you have a tub clean cycle, you should use it at least as often as recommended by the manufacturer. ALL softeners (and the \"dissolvable\" pod casings for many detergents) can leave deposits and if not routinely cleaned they can end up ruining a machine - for most people. If you don't mind totally disassembling all the parts in which the fluids travel, then you can fix it yourself. Better to clean the tub and dispensers regularly to forgo having an issue at all.I do agree things get a bit fussy about 3/4 the way down. You may have to tilt the box or jiggle it. I've found it you pull one corner of the bag up through the hole made for the measuring cup & use a binder clip to secure it to the top it helps a ton!But seriously, how hard is it to move a little more, it give you a teensy bit more excercise with every load \ud83d\ude42The softener itself is wonderful. It doesn't annoy my skin, it is easy to use and generally works well.",

I save money, i dont have to go to the store, and it makes me feel really good about the fact my parents dont have to carry this stuff from the store to the car and then into the house, the box lakes up less room than the bottles that were accustomed to, it sits there on the shelf with a convenient 1/4 turn valve at the bottom of the box so that we don't ever have to pick it up. just twist measure and pour. that alone is good enough of a reason never to look back, i hope that you find this helpful, happy cleaning.",

I started using Downey Free about a year ago and am really thrilled with the result. I\u2019ve never been able to use fabric softener before this. I was intrigued by the packaging because plastics are going to ruin the oceans, seriously. So when this arrived it took a minute to figure out how to set up the box. Once I got it situated on top of my washing machine I noticed that there\u2019s no need to use the cup! I can just open the spout and fill the fabric softener receptacle on my washing machine - it\u2019s magical. Love the product, and will continue to purchase it in this packaging as long as it\u2019s still being made this way. Excellent!!!",

I love the packaging (well once you learn how to open it). My laundry products sit in a shelf above the W-D. This box has a spout with a nozzle that extends over the side of the shelf with a regulation knob. Never have to handle until empty.As I cautioned above this is only for someone that puts the product on a higher shelf and does not want to have to handle the plastic jug. Do not be surprised if you say a few words under your breath when opening for the first time but the end result is a well engineered container that costs less, is easier to handle with the same product.I have very sensitive skin and Downy free, clear and perfume free, is absolutely the only softener I use.

Not sure how you are supposed to fill the little cup straight from it without overfilling the cup?But for me it serves it's purpose perfectly.Easy to store and refills my bottle.This stuff is amazing! My partner failed to tell me for years that the perfume from normal fabric softener was causing a lot of skin irritation. . . But since we've started using this stuff soft clothes and noose skin irritation. It even works great on my babies clothes with no irritation tk her sensitive skin!",
