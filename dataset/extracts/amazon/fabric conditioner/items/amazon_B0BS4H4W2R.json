These work really well and smell like $30 fancy candles. I sprayed the ocean smell in my bathroom and I can smell it every time I step on the bath mat or move the shower curtain. I used the mountain scent in my bedroom, and it smells just delightful when I hop into bed. My teenager is partial to the mountain fragrance and keeps swiping it! I will definitely be buying again.

I sensed that getting into bed had a comparable response to a cat using the litterbox when scent was released from the litter when the cat stepped on it. Interesting concept and a pleasing one, but in the future I'll seek a more floral spray. The scent is mild and does last several days but was more stimulating than restful.
