        "description": "With Bounce Outdoor Fresh Dryer Sheets, static cling doesn't have to be a thing. Bounce Dryer Sheets help prevent static build up that occurs in the dryer so you can look and feel your best. America's #1 dryer sheet brand* is tough on wrinkles, too. Toss a sheet in the dryer to keep clothes looking their best and reduce wrinkles so your clothes will be ready to wear right away, making you look and feel confident. Bounce Outdoor Fresh Dryer Sheets don't stop there. From the moment you pull your laundry out of the dryer, Bounce Dryer Sheets give your clothes a fresh and lasting scent and a noticeably soft feel. Way less static, fewer wrinkles, softer fabrics, and an outdoor fresh scent is that easy. Toss in two Bounce Dryer Sheets for your average loads to iron less, fight more static, and add more softness and freshness. One will do for small loads, and if you're catching up on laundry and have an extra large load, toss in three! You can also use Bounce Dryer Sheets around the house. Tuck them in drawers or closets, put them in gym bags and suitcases, or stash them at the bottom of your trashcan to bring that Bounce Outdoor Fresh scent you know and love out of the dryer and into your home.*based on sales",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Bounce Dryer Sheets in the Outdoor Fresh Scent variant, and I must say that despite the initial skepticism, they have pleasantly surprised me. While they may not have met my expectations in terms of softening my sheets, reducing static, and fighting wrinkles, there are still several positive aspects worth mentioning.To begin with, the Outdoor Fresh Scent is delightful. It infuses a subtle and refreshing fragrance into my laundry, leaving a pleasant aroma that lingers long after the drying cycle. The gentle scent is not overpowering and adds a touch of freshness to my clothes, making them more enjoyable to wear throughout the day. While the softening effect may not be as intense as I had hoped, I have noticed a subtle improvement in the overall texture of my clothes. While not as pronounced as some other fabric softeners on the market, the Bounce Dryer Sheets do provide a gentle touch that adds a hint of comfort to my laundry.",
