I was so excited when I saw it on the shelf I started dancing around and I squeeled. LOL my husband was so embarrassed!! I love the smell of this especially with Tide with Bleach powder detergent and the Blue Purex Crystals softener. Those three smells together make for WONDERFUL smelling clothes and towels and sheets!!!",
