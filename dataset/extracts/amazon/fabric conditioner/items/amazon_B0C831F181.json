                "reviewText": "So this smells really good in the jug. I notice way more of the white tea scent compared to the fig (which is great, since I was worried the fig would be overpowering but it is a very light and refreshing scent). The recommended amount per load seems to be enough after using it a couple times on different fabric types...unlike many of the eco-friendly alternatives I have tried where I have to double or triple the amount to get the same results as the bigger name brand stuff.While it does smell great in the jug, I find that the scent is pretty mild by the time things come out of the dryer (not a huge deal to me, but it could be a pro or con depending on what you are looking for).",
