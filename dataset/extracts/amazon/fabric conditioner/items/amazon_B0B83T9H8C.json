                "reviewText": "Works great to remove smells from laundry and leaves clothes smelling fresh and soft, without the use of fabric softener. I love the scent as it is very light and not overpowering.The value, however, isn\u2019t really there. Without a coupon you\u2019re paying $13, which is fairly pricy for what it does. You could put 1/2 cup vinegar in the fabric softener tray and it does the same thing, just without the scent.Also, the cap is a bit annoying to use and seems like an afterthought. In the pictures on the label it shows a pouring spout, but the bottle is like a gatorade sized hole. Not the easiest to pour when it\u2019s full.Overall though the product works well, even if it is a bit pricey.",

                "reviewText": "This product is quite pricy but so worth it! It makes my clothes feel softer and better than a regular softener does. Also my clothes come out smelling so fresh, no scent boosters needed anymore. I\u2019m guess that basically evens out the pricing with buying softener and scent booster. This is basically that combined into one!",
