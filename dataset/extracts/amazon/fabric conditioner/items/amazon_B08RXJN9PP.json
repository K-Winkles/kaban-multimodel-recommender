These little sheets do not have a strong aroma which helps to avoid my allergy flair ups. When I do hand laundry in my small sink, I use one-half sheet. Another advantage is the clothes are very easy to rinse saving time and water. The only \u201ccon\u201d is it does not handle bad odors very well. I have kitties and I have to pre-treat the article before washing, or the kitty odor stays. All my laundry gets clean just as well as any of the liquid detergent that I have used.",

I will try the lavender dryer sheets next. We are very satisfied with these products and we will continue to buy them.",

Easy to pack, easy to use.",

                "reviewText": "I love this laundry detergent sheet and the complimentary dryer sheets. The detergent foams up really nicely, dissolves quickly and completely, and gets my clothes clean. Plus, they hardly take up any space and I feel much better not throwing away huge plastic jugs. Just be sure to store them in a manner they won get wet.I absolutely adore the dryer sheets. They don\u2019t smell chemically at all, they make my clothes super soft and smell good (I use two of the dryer sheets every time - I usually wash extra large loads), plus they\u2019re not awful for your health and the environment like regular dryer sheets! I\u2019m so happy I found these and will be purchasing more.",

                "reviewText": "I think this is a great concept. Love these and love that I don\u2019t have to go out and buy a huge container of detergent and lug it around. I went on vacation and we had a washer/dryer. I brought these washer sheets and they were great! I actually bought them for my daughter who is going off to college. Thought I\u2019d try them and see if they were worth shipping to her so she didn\u2019t have to worry about storing liquid detergent - since she\u2019s in a dorm and space is a premium. They work pretty good and love the dryer sheets. I only wish they gave you the same number of dryer sheets as washer sheets, or more. I also use dryer balls and love that my clothes don\u2019t have that liquid detergent smell - I used to like it but it\u2019s too much and you don\u2019t realize that you really don\u2019t need all that for the laundry to be clean. It\u2019s a much lighter scent and I like it. Highly recommend if you\u2019re looking to ditch the big bottles and want something that\u2019s better for the environment and your skin.",

                "reviewText": "When I received my package from Amazon, opened the bag and there was only 1 box. I thought someone had left something out and I sent an unhappy note to the seller. Nope. Once I got the box opened, you have to break the seal on the white label. Once the box was opened, I found 2 boxes inside, 1 for laundry sheets & 1 for dryer sheets. 3rd picture shows 1 laundry sheet ready to use.I did 2 loads of laundry. The one with clothing had a cloth hanky that had blood stains, now it doesn't. There were also cloth napkins that had food stains, now they don't. My clothing came out of the washer fresh smelling & clean. The dryer sheet made them soft, wrinkle free and smelling great! The 2nd load was a load of of towels & washcloths, clean & smelling fresh. I don't use dryer sheets when I dry my towels & sheets.Very pleased with the Sheets Laundry products. I live in senior housing and showed my neighbors the Sheets Laundry products, they were very interested. As for me, no more buy or having to lug laundry detergent in plastic upstairs!PS I contacted Sheets Laundry and let them know once I got the box opened I had both products and ignore my unhappy note ;).",
