I have asthma and a lot of allergies and spent a lot of time researching various household products that I could use that wouldn't aggravate these health conditions. Let me tell you, its no easy feat finding cleaning products that I can use. Even products that will use words like \" organic\" or \"natural\" arent always as wholesome as they might seem. Even in this brand, the other scents have additional ingredients that set off my asthma. But luckily this \"morning fresh\" scent is very user friendly when it comes to this user and her obnoxious allergies!As far as its functionality as a fabric softener, it does make my clothes soft and fluffy. I usually use one capful of the softener per load, or two if I want what ever I am washing to be super soft (I have a HE washer, so its possible you'd need a different amount in a standard washing machine).Also, I happen to like the scent itself. I find it very pleasant, so bonus!! :-PVery happy with my purchase",
