Bottle gets slippery (after spilling product) and I\u2019ve dropped BOTH bottles (resulting in cracked plastic and more spillage. Otherwise, THIS STUFF ROCKS NO KIDDING!Amazed at how well it works. Clothes are DEFINITELY cleaner and smell amazing. I have noticed not to use it on items two washes in-a-row. It makes the fabric unhappy. I can\u2019t think of another way to describe it. Use it every OTHER washing. Do use it though\u2026there is absolutely no denying this product\u2019s effectiveness! It\u2019s not a fabric softener\u2026it\u2019s a low ph rinse aid and it\u2019s a game changer.",

A little goes a long way. You don't need to use much at all.The only downside aside from the ridiculous price is that the bottle lacks a pour spout. It should really have one. I just pour it directly into drum during the rinse cycle, but I could imagine trying to pour it into a fabric softener dispenser or Downy ball would be annoying.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Great for some odors, not so much with others",
                "reviewText": "I have three different types of odors to contend with when I do laundry. The first is heavy tobacco smoke, acquired secondhand during several hours in small, poorly ventilated spaces with multiple heavy cigarette smokers. This product is fantastic for that- even when the cigarette smell is eye wateringly strong. Until I find a way to get my emo younger relations to stop smoking (maybe when they outgrow the emo thing?), I will continue to buy this product in bulk.The second odor is various laboratory chemicals like formalin, xylene, and glutaraldehyde. This fabric rinse struggles there, but manages to get rid of lower levels of all three. It doesn't do much against more than a small amount of xylene, but then again, very few things besides a blowtorch can completely banish xylene.The third odor is from bodily fluids. There are dozens of products on the market formulated specifically for urine, feces, or both. If that is what you are trying to get rid of in your laundry, I would recommend exploring those more specific products instead. This rinse will work reasonably well against a small spot or two, but if you are washing clothing and sheets for someone with incontinence issues, this just isn't up to the job.Two other positive points about this product: It has a scent, but it is minimal. It doesn't cover odors in fabrics with a layer of fake lavender or whatever, but actually removes them. Also, it is a pretty decent fabric softener, and I have found that I don't have to add one when I use this rinse.",

It doesn't leave a heavy coat on your laundry like fabric softener can but you do get such a great clean clean smell with your laundry. It helped get that ick smell out of clothes that were forgotten in the washer.",
