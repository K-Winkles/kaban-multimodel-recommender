                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Best smelling laundry EVER",
                "reviewText": "Who knew you could fall in love with laundry supplies? I don't remember how I came across this laundry kit on Amazon, but I was intrigued by the description of the scent. We try to use natural products in our home, but as anyone who uses natural products knows, they don't always work well at all. This is often the case with laundry soap and softener. They usually smell good, but what good is nice smelling clothing when the soap doesn't clean the clothing?I am very happy to report that not only does Frey soap and softener smell AMAZING, it gets your laundry CLEAN. You still need to use stain treatment for tougher stains like grease or oil, but others such as coffee, tomato sauce, sweat, and deodorant come out easily. Armpit stains and stink in fabric come out clean rather than the scent of the laundry soap or softener covering it up and the body odor smell coming back later when the fabric is warmed up by the wearer. This is a problem we've had with about half the natural laundry products we've tried over the years, but not with Frey. Everything from bed sheets to bath towels to baby clothes come out truly cleaned.When I got these bottles, my first thought was no way I would get 50 loads worth of laundry which is what is claimed on the bottles. The soap and softener are very concentrated, so you use a lot less than you would even with other concentrated products. A few pumps from each is all you need if you have an HE machine. The soap and softener both rinse out of fabric completely and cleanly, and the softener doesn't coat fabric with any kind of residue like many commercial versions. You can use this softener and/or the dryer sheets with your towels and wash clothes and not worry about build-up making the fabric non-absorbent. Frey's products are environmentally friendly, natural, biodegradable, and sensitive skin friendly even with the scent.As for the scent, I would describe it as pretty darn close to the Yankee Candle scent of \"Midsummer's Night\". A friend of mine describes it as \"the scent of a warm guy just out of the shower after using woodsy-scented soap and shampoo\". Compared to the usual floral or citrus scents of laundry products, my husband and son absolutely love the scent of Frey's products. It's a little heavy for summertime, but is absolutely incredible on cold winter nights when you are snuggling down into flannel bedsheets. All you need is a fireplace and a bear rug and you can pretend you're in a secluded cabin somewhere with your honey on vacation. Frey offers a scent booster as well as scented dryer sheets, but using all four pushes the scent from pleasant to very overwhelming. You don't need to use dryer sheets if you use the laundry softener, but if you choose to I recommend going with an unscented version. Your laundry will still come out smelling great. It just won't knock other people over with the scent. If you work somewhere that has rules about strongly scented products, then you will definitely NOT want to use all four products. Using just the scented softener or dryer sheets for work clothing would still allow you to experience the wonderful scent, but at a much more subtle/subdued level. Frey does actually offer a lighter version of this scent that you may wish to try instead. It smells just as amazing and is like going from an eau de parfum to an eau de toilette - not as powerful and doesn't linger as long on fabrics.Even if you use this only for your bed sheets, Frey laundry products are...wow...just wow...",

My husband has a very hard-working job and his clothes get very dirty and smelly and I'm always trying out new things to get out the dirt and the odors. And I couldn't believe after just putting a few squirts of this product in the washer with his clothes that not only did the dirt come off but they smelled the wonderfully! Even after a Hard Day's Work he came home and even though he was dirty his clothes still smelled really good! This product is a little pricey for me but if you're looking for something that makes your laundry smell really good plus gets out the dirt this is definitely a product for you.",

                "reviewText": "I had the original black bottle of the cedar Frey. It made my clothes smell amazing, like campfire. I was nearly out so I purchased a new bottle of detergent and softener. Out of the bottle the scent is noticeably different. I had several people compare the original to the new bottle and they agreed. Out of the dryer my clothes did not smell like the fragrance at all like they originally did. My wool that I line dry barely retained a fragrance. The original black bottles would make my clothes smell like the cedar for weeks before washing again. I contacted their customer support and they adamantly denied having changed the formula. If you loved the original black bottle, this is not the same formula and do not spend your money on it. I am returning it and am so disappointed in this product.",

                "reviewText": "Although I am a new customer, I can already tell that I will be returning to purchase more FREY products in the near future! After using the FREY detergent and conditioner for the first time, I was pleased with how fresh and clean my clothes felt, despite how little FREY detergent/conditioner I was instructed to use in comparison to regular detergent. And that\u2019s not to mention how incredible it made my clothes smell- even days after having been out of the dryer, my clothes are still as fragrant as though they had just been washed! I have used various other all-natural laundry detergents/conditioners in the past, however FREY is certainly the only 100% natural detergent/conditioner I have used that smells this good. I would highly recommend this product to any who may be considering it- the 100% natural, concentrated formula really does give you your money\u2019s worth!",
