This coating neutralizes the static charge that builds up on clothes during the drying process, preventing them from sticking together. Can I use dryer sheets in a heat pump dryer? Yes. You can use dryer sheets in a heat pump dryer. However there are a few things to keep in mind. The sheets work best in heat pump dryers that have a reverse tumble feature. If you don't have reverse tumble, use two or three sheets per load. Are these unscented? No. Our dryer sheets feature a light, natural smelling scent with botanical aromas that won\u2019t overpower you. Our dryer and fabric softener sheets have a long lasting perfume that\u2019s subtle and fresh. How do these help reduce wrinkles? Dryer sheets reduce wrinkles in a few ways. They coat the fibers of the clothes with a thin layer of softener. They help to keep the clothes moist during the drying cycle and they can help to relax wrinkles that have already formed. Will these dryer sheets clog my lint filter? Slowly over time, your lint filter needs regular cleaning to remove buildup that may accumulate. For best results, clean the lint filter after every use and inspect the lint filter regularly for signs of residue buildup.",

                "reviewText": "These dryer sheets from Raw Basics are a toughie to review properly. The listing cites that it contains both cationic and noninonic types of softening agents, that they claim is non-toxic. But, the most popular cationic ingredient is \u201cDialkylester dimethyl ammonium methosulfate\u201d it\u2019s essentially an ammonium salt that is used in many softeners for softening and anti-static. The problem is it\u2019s also associated with respiratory irritation and there\u2019s some other red flag health issues linked to it as well. Nowhere on the box is there a list of ingredients, and since it\u2019s got cationic softener in this, I\u2019m not convinced this is non-toxic. There needs to be ingredient transparency.This looks just like a bounce sheet, so I\u2019m not convinced that the fibers are eco-friendly. The scent is powdery/outdoor fresh, and performance is just like the commercial dryer sheets I\u2019ve used in the past. Not like the truly eco-friendly, non-toxic sheets that are out. Made in China.My take-a-way is that they\u2019re trying to package this as an eco-friendly, non-toxic dryer sheet, but I\u2019m not convinced that these are. Ingredient labeling and more discussion around their manufacturing practices are needed. HOW is their product non-toxic? What are they not adding?It looks like the one solid eco-friendly selling point is the packaging. It\u2019s plastic free, and the cardboard box it comes in is un-bleached.",
