                "reviewText": "This is the best fabric softener you can purchase. The clothes come out so soft and the smell is amazing, not overwhelmingly obnoxious like some of the other brands. I use it the most on my husband\u2019s clothes, as he seems to sweat a lot and this takes out all of the unpleasant odors. I like him to put on a clean shirt and smell how fresh and clean it is. It also doesn\u2019t smell like a baby product so you don\u2019t have to worry about that. I would use it with every load I do, but the cost prevents me from doing this. For laundry like towels, I just use the cheaper liquid fabric softener, like the Sam\u2019s brand, and my towels come out super soft with it, but the nice smell does not hold well like with these. I just wish that I could find a way to purchase them cheaper than they are, so I just limit using them for the stinky clothes. He also has many dry fit shirts from expensive brands like Land\u2019s End, L.L. Bean and Eddie Bauer. They advise not to use any fabric softener ever. Apparently with these type of shirts, the liquid fabric softener can cause a waxy buildup in the fibers, where they won\u2019t work with cooling that they are intended to provide. I don\u2019t feel like these cause any build up and there isn\u2019t a concern with these about staining your clothing since I have been using these consistently and I have not had any problems. I highly recommend these and hopefully the company will come down on the price at some point. The other brands tend to be too highly priced as well. The good thing is that it doesn\u2019t take a large amount for the desired results. I think if you purchase these that you will never buy any other brand of this type of product in the future. These spoil you.",

Use a few beads until you get the right amount is my suggestion. I didn\u2019t like in laundry but I\u2019m using in little mesh drawstring bags that I hang in an outside garbage can where I put used doggy pee pads. Works great. Too strong for my drawers in my bedroom also.",

At timesbl i find the smell can be overpowering so I adjust and use half cups on each each wash. It comes down to personal preference i guess.
