These days, with all the horrible products in our foods and cleaning agents, it's nice to find a good company that cares about what they sell their customers. Hopefully, they don't get bought out like all the others. Thanks for a great product. The drier sheets work very well, with no more harsh chemicals.",

                "reviewText": "I got this one in peppermint. When I opened the Amazon bag, I got excited at how potent the scent was. And this was before opening the dryer sheet box. I tested this with a load of laundry right away looking forward to my clothes smelling minty fresh, but I was disappointed. When I tell you this left ZERO fragrance. I was bummed. Not even a trace of it. I even waited hours later when the clothes cooled down to see if there was something, but nope! So when it comes to picking a fragrance, I would probably pick any since it won't leave a scent anyway. Like the detergent, I appreciate the reason behind this brand with is being as healthy as possible and also cruelty free. But I personally love having some fresh scent because not having any makes it feel like it's not clean and makes my laundry routine less enjoyable. The positive thing is that it does leave my clothes soft. So if you're all about unscented and natural laundry products, this is for you. I sadly won't buy it again until they find a way to make the fragrance stay on your clothes.",

Saw an ad for a different brand of this type of sheet, so came to Amazon to read and learn. I decided on this product and am very pleased. I chose peppermint scent, and no, my clothes didn't smell like gum, lol. And the clothes came from the dryer so nice and soft! I just got these, so have only done a few loads of laundry, but I believe I'm converted!",
