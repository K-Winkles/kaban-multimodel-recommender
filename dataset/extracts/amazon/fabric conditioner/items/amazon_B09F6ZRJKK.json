                "reviewText": "I bought a bottle of this and a few other clean eco friendly detergents to try back in Feb 13 2021. My fiance and I have only been using this since because I wanted to test each one out on its own until we\u2019ve used them all. When we do laundry we usually do large loads and since we have an older washing machine it\u2019s not energy efficient so we do two \u201cdoses\u201d which would be two squirts I guess with its easy dose cap. Even though it doesn\u2019t seem like it wouldn\u2019t be enough it works great and we\u2019ve both been really happy with this detergent. We each do a large load of clothes maybe every other week and clean towels and bedding just about as much so I thought we would have blown though such a tiny bottle by now. This is our first experience in a concentrated detergent so we were used to the big things of detergent and having to use a lot of it to get our laundry clean but this stuff has been doing great. We live in a pretty small apartment with not a lot of storage space so replacing a giant container of detergent for something more compact has been really nice. It also is a lot less of a hassle to dispense and we feel good about the ingredients in this too. We\u2019ve been trying to be more conscious about the ingredients in the products we use and this was an easy transition from what we used before. I think now if we had to use regular detergent it would just feel wrong lol. Even though we thought we\u2019d go though a whole bottle by now we still have a quarter left which exceeded our expectations. The one thing we noticed that was odd and weren\u2019t used to was the fact our clothes had NO scent at all but they were clean. Usually we had some kind of scent on our laundry that gave it that \u201cclean\u201d smell and I\u2019m sure it was clean but it was unnecessary and full of chemicals. I haven\u2019t noticed any weird buildups or damage to our laundry from this product so I really appreciate that too lol. Overall I would really recommend this product theres so many positives with it and I don\u2019t think I would ever want to go back to \u201ctraditional\u201d detergent again. I also think is worth the cost, much easier to use, less messy, and takes up less space, and because it\u2019s more concentrated you don\u2019t need to use as much and it cuts cost on transportation. I think more products should be like this. Traditional detergents are watered down so it makes it heavier which in turn costs more money to transport it and it requires more plastic waste too. It\u2019s just overall a great product in our opinion",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great product for anyone w/ sensitive skin or chemical sensitivities --- works well in most machines & environmentally conscious",
                "reviewText": "I bought this as an alternative to Tide's Free & Gentle because the price at the time was significantly lower. While this is marketed as a baby laundry detergent product, the only child in my house is Lilly and she's a rabbit (and given she is potty trained, has fur, and cleans herself, I do not need laundry detergent for her.) More or less my need was for something that cleaned reasonably well but did not irritate my skin as certain dyes and fragrances can. Overall, this does what I need it to do and I think it is a good product.*From my own usage, I have found that Seventh Generation...---Does NOT irritate sensitive skin---Does NOT irritate asthma (despite it having some scent to it)---Does NOT leave any residue on clothes (which can lead to skin irritation)---Does NOT actively brighten colors (nor does it fade colors, either)---Does an OK job at removing stains (like Tide's product, I think it works very well for this sort of product designed with sensitivities in mind, but with that said I sometimes need to use some sort of a pre-treatment stain-remover for tougher stains, which I do not mind but wanted to note for someone who wants a true all-in-one product, as this is not it)---Does a good job at removing sweat stains (again taking into account how this is made for sensitivities instead of being an aggressive cleaner)---Does an excellent job at removing sweat odors---Works equally-well in front loading and side loading machines---Works equally-well in both standard and HE machines---Has a top cup design that is not very durable and does not hold up well to handling seen with shipping (some of mine occasionally arrive with a cracked cup)I figured I would list my observations individually in the event that certain ones apply to you more than others. But overall, 7th Gen works really well. As an added bonus, this is a product that is mindful of the environment, which is always a good thing. So whether you use this for babies or for someone with sensitive skin or for someone who prefers to avoid certain chemicals found in most detergents, this is a great product and it can often be had for a great price***..((((***Note that I have observed this is one of those products in which the price varies substantially, and shifts on a frequent basis...if you add this to your cart and monitor it over a few days or weeks, you may be able to get a better deal on it than the current pricing! *Also note that this stuff is super-concentrated, so dosing correctly is important [when I first got it, I did not believe such a tiny cap-full was sufficient for a full-load, but it was and is.]))))",

                "reviewText": "Seventh Generation products are one of my favorite cleaners to buy. Unfortunately, they are also one of the most expensive cleaning products out there! So, I can't always support them and our eco-friendly economy. I really like the smell of this laundry soap. It comes in a few varieties. Both are clean and pleasant. It also comes in an unscented for sensitive skin. Keep in mind that it is an ULTRA concentrated detergent so you don't have to use so much. I wish I could enjoy using it full-time to keep my clothes clean as it does a great job, but I'm on a budget. So sorry.",
