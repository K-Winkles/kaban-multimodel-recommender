I've been using Tide for a long time, and I've been using the powder. This is so much easier to use. I dissolve 2 measuring tablespoons in 2 cups of water, pour it in my washer, dump the clothes in, and hit Start! Great laundry detergent!",

I'm tempted to get the unscented on my repurchase (because of my cat who stares in me in judgement for any scent), but I like the scent so much I am going scented again. Scent is delicate, light, fragrant, pleasant. I mostly go natural on scents, if any at all; this definitely doesn't smell like essential oil but it's delicate enough it works. I initially got this for lingerie only. Stuff didn't last nearly long enough, because I realized I liked using it on all my linens (bedding, sheets, linen napkins, cottons), and as well as undergarments. So here I am again, getting a new bottle for \"lingerie\".",

                "reviewText": "I adore this product! Since I only do laundry for one and have a lot of professional washable items, along with relatively sensitive skin, I use this product almost exclusively for all of my clothing laundry. I've even successfully washed Costco 100% cashmere sweaters in a lingerie bag with this stuff with wonderful results (though I don't recommend it, I just hate dry cleaning and chemicals and hand washing makes it difficult to rinse when you don't have a huge garage sink, only a small apartment with bathroom and kitchen sinks).I use this product to hand wash the outside of my washable pillow, too. I take a clean rag made from a hand towel, get it wet and put a bit of the Ovacion on it, then pad down the outside of my pillow and get it relatively wet. I then rinse the rag and get it fairly wet then go over the outside of the pillow to sort of rinse it. I throw the pillow in the dryer with a few tennis balls and it comes out extremely fresh, whereas washing my super thick pillow in the washer and drying it takes a full day.I also use this hand wash method, without always using the dryer, on the top part of my comforter that touches my face. My washer isn't big enough to put the comforter in without ripping it to shreds, so I wash the upper foot of it by hand and let it air dry (I do throw it in the dryer once in a while with the wet side facing the incoming hot air to freshen the whole thing ever month or so). This product is delicate enough to avoid irritating my skin even when not fully rinsed, but it breaks down dirt and oils well enough to freshen these items up.",
