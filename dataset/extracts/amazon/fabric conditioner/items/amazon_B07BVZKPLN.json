It\u2019s a relaxing, springtime smell that reminds me of a calm meadow. The scent is not too strong, but if I close my eyes, for a minutes I can escape the stress of my hectic day.A toasty towel or sweater smells so much more inviting when you add this to your wash. It\u2019s kind of my guilty pleasure, something I do for me, but funny thing, I ran out a few weeks ago, and my husband complained that his shirts didn\u2019t smell clean and asked I\u2019d had one of the girls do the laundry. So, it\u2019s not just me...and it\u2019s back in stock at our house (yay, Amazon Prime!). A laundry product that can make you smile from time to time throughout the week is a worthwhile investment I think.",
