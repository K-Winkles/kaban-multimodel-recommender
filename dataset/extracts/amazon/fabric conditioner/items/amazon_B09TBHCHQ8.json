The product is Vegan, and it is Cruelty-Free! The fragrance is really beautiful, though I can't begin to describe it. My clothes emerged nice and soft from the washer, which is important, since I don't have a dryer. I just love the fragrance of this fabric conditioner! Be sure to shake it really well before use.The product arrived in perfect condition, a 16.9 oz bottle (500 ml), with a small footprint, since it is very concentrated. The product is imported from Korea. The bottle is safety sealed also.It would be easier to use if the cap worked as a measure, which it does not. So, you'll need to find a measuring cup of some sort (maybe an old softener bottle cap) to measure 20-25 ml per load. You'll get 20-25 loads of softness, depending on the size of the laundry load.I really love the fragrance, softness, and the fact that this product is Vegan and Cruelty-Free. It's a little on the pricey side, but for the quality, it will be worth it to many of us. I recommend this product.",

The simple instructions - just shake the bottle and pour the desired amount into the washer - make it incredibly easy to use. As a Korean company, I appreciate the inclusion of English labeling on the bottle, even if it's just a sticker over the original Korean language.While the instructions could be more detailed regarding the amount to pour, I've found that using my own judgment works well. It would be convenient if a measurement cup were included, but eye-balling the amount hasn't been an issue for me.The fragrance of the fabric conditioner is delightful, and I've noticed that my clothes come out of the wash feeling soft and smelling fresh. Overall, despite some minor drawbacks in the instructions and packaging, the performance of this fabric conditioner has been impressive, making it a worthwhile addition to my laundry routine.",

I like that this conditioner has a different (in a good way) smell. I already love the smell of figs in everything else, so this is just right for me. It smells stronger right out of the bottle and less strong on clothes, but it is there. It does soften the laundry as well. The bottle comes sealed, which is a good first impression. The shape of the bottle is not ideal for pouring the conditioner out and you have to use your own measuring cup, but these are only minor things. The conditioner is a bit expensive, but it is used in small amounts and will last a while.",

It smells very strong when first opening the bottle, but using it at the recommended dose (1/3 of a regular conditioner) leaves the clothes with only a faint trace of scent.The scent is fantastic. We grow fig bushes/trees and this does have hints of fig, along with an forest smell background. It is like a perfect mix of feminine and masculine. Very nice. While it smells nice from the bottle, it does not stay very well on the clothes. I ended up using 2/3 of a regular fabric softener dose to get a decent amount of remaining scent. That makes this a rather pricey product.It does a decent job in making the clothing soft and static free. They are demonstrably fluffier after using this product, even at the recommended dosing.",

                "reviewText": "I love the LAVOIR fabric softener or conditioner. It is non-allergenic and my skin loves it.I use the baby liquid detergent due to sensitive skin. I do need sometimes to use fabric conditioner to soften denim pants, minimize wrinkles on delicate clothes, and prevent the generation of static. This LAVOIR provides all those plus the benefit of being all-natural using plant-derived ingredients.The bottle is pretty cute with a matte color. The liquid conditioner is protected by a safety seal foil around the bottle\u2019s mouth. The scent is fruity with a hint of fig and cedar, it has a pleasant smell and is non-irritating.Overall, I now switched to this brand, and will be the family fabric conditioner. Good stuff! Highly recommended!",

It leaves my blankets feeling softer. \ud83d\udc95 The smell did disappear in the wash though, I\u2019m guessing masked by the other products I use- detergents, etc. so I wish the smell did linger, bc it\u2019s super nice. The price point is high, in my opinion, but for the quality of the product- it can be justified by many.",

Indeed, I feel that the towel has become softer, but it's not particularly noticeable. It's possible that the water quality here is still good and not particularly hard. I think it might help more noticeably in places where the water is harder. There's also noticeably less static electricity now.",

                "reviewText": "This softener made my bedding so soft and it smells so grown. I was confused about how much to use, but just did a conversion from 20 ML to TBSP (around 1.5) and used that amount with a large load and they came out great. I am fond of the smell, which has hints of wood and fruit, but seems more complex. I typically only use scent/softener on my outer bedding due to sensitive skin allergies/irritation, but accidentally washed my fitted sheet and haven't had any problems that I tend to have with the usual supermarket brands, so this is a nice surprise to me.",
