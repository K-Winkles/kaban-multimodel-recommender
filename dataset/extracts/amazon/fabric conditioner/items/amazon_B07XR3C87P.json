Bacteria can spread from one fabric to another in the laundry basket, from the washing-machine drum to the next load. Some of these bacteria can survive following the wash cycle. When it comes to certain laundry loads such as children's clothes or sportswear, you want to eliminate bacteria that may cause illnesses and create lingering bad smells. But detergents alone don't actually kill all bacteria. Introducing Lysol Laundry Sanitizer free & Clear, an additive specially designed to kill 99.9% of bacteria in laundry when used as directed. Lysol Laundry Sanitizer free & Clear is free from fragrance and free from dye. Simply add Lysol Laundry Sanitizer to your rinse cycle. It does not contain any chlorine bleach and even works in cold water so is safe to use on most fabrics including whites, colors and darks.",
