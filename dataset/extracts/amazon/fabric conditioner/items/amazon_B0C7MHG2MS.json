However, the labels they added were useless to me. I was looking for a bleach label and a sanitizer label. Or a blank one, and I can add sanitizer. But there were 3 detergent labels and 3 softener labels. That was disappointing, but not enough to return the whole set. I will probably just use my label maker to put over it but that's a hassle, I may just go with the detergent and softener labels.",
