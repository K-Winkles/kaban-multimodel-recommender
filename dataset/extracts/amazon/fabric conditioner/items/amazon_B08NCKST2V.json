Using pods instead of measuring liquid leaves less mess and is easier for the kids to manage. The softener dispenser on their washing machine does not work so the kids were pouring the softener directly onto the clothes. If you have ever done that before, \u270b\ufe0f I have, you know it can ruin your clothes. So that's another plus for using these pods. The only needed improvement I notice is that they really don't put out the scent I was expecting. The scent is very faint so I use gain dryer sheets to get the clothes smelling good. However, this could just be my issue because I like a strong scent on my clothes. With that said, I most likely will purchase the softener pods again.",

They are fine, except i have a washer with automatic dispensing and it doesn\u2019t work very well in the softener dispenser. I have to cut open the outer wrap and pour contents into the dispenser, the wrapper does not disintegrate in the dispenser otherwise. It does have a nice, subtle scent, not obnoxious.",

I use cool water 80% of the time and have zero troubles dissolving. These are great. My clothes feel good(not filmy) soft, static free, smell neutral to a light scent. The reason for the switch was to stop adding plastic jugs to the landfill. These come in a small cardboard box 100% recyclable and I\u2019m extremely happy with all of it.",

                "reviewText": "I was hoping to find a fabric softener that didn't require huge jugs and without costing an arm and a leg. I had hoped this might be a viable answer. It was a total failure. The product came in a nice small cardboard box with little sachets of powdered softener in it. I was anxious to try it out and I am 100% disappointed. The outer pack dissolved well, but the powder in it only partially dissolved. Moreover it didn't soften or remove the static and it provided no scent whatsoever. This was supposed to have a fresh scent, and it does when you smell the actual sachet, but it did not smell while in use and the clothes have no scent after having been washed. I even tried dissolving one in a small bucket of hot water and it still failed to dissolve and the water didn't seem to feel like it should. 100% total failure on all counts. I will be returning it.",

I love that I don't have to lift a heavy plastic jug of liquid softener around, and these would be great for trips to the laundrymat. The pods completely dissolve in the wash, I've used half a box and have never found residue on my clothes. I got the clean & crisp scent, which is very light and subtle. If you are washing a smoker's clothes, you may want to get the lavender scent.",
