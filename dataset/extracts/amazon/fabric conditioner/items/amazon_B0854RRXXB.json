The cardboard covering the noosle was difficult but not impossible. Just need to be careful.From my perspective, The good definitely outweighs the bad.",

As many other review state, the box is smaller than you will expect ( 7x7 inch) and liquid flows VERY fast from a new box. Definitely is original downy product, same scent etc..... but ultra concentrated/VERY thick- I use much less to get the same level of softness. It's a good product, no complaints ~ box is wobbly on top of the machines during use (same place I keep the plastic jugs for ease of use with my front load machine)Although this is a quality liquid fabric softener , in the future, I will buy the downy pouches and reuse/refill a plastic jug . After trying the eco-box, i feel the jugs are easier to handle (less fear of them falling over and leaking)",

                "reviewText": "Same good downy, in practical packaging. Best part about this is the spout does not drip at all. Tide has the same version so it\u2019s perfect. The box is about the same size as the regular large downy container. Maybe an inch higher. But there\u2019s also a small spot on the top of the box that holds the measuring cup! So much more practical on my shelf and the cup has a designated spot which is less mess on my shelf. Genius practical design and will not be going back to the bottles. Love this so much.",

I believe it.Downy smells good and is an excellent fabric softener.",
