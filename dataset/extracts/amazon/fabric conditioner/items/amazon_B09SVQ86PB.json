                "reviewText": "I have VERY sensitive skin, am allergic to a variety of natural and chemical ingredients (e.g., formaldehyde) and this fabric softener does not cause me ANY irritation at all! It doesn't contain harsh or toxic ingredients in fabric softeners that cause allergic reactions for me. I'll be buying this brand from now on! This fabric softener smells so natural and fresh, with a soft lavender scent that is unlike the chemically scents in other brands. My clothes are left soft with a subtle, clean lavender fragrance. Another benefit is that even if I use a lot of the product on items that air dry which I want to feel very soft, such as a throw blanket or sweater, the liquid does not leave residue or marks on fabric and rinses out properly. The price is great for the amount you receive as well. Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I like using more natural fabric softeners but unfortunately one of my faves is no longer available, so I thought I would try Bleu Lavande. Before I took off the cap I could smell lavender and was afraid it might be too much scent, but the softener is concentrated and when towels were dry there was just the faintest scent.They were also quite soft with no waxy feeling like some of the non-natural softeners. I like that it's concentrated and I use less, so that is a plus too. So far I am happy with the performance so far.",

                "reviewText": "I am a fish monger and spend all day cutting and throwing fish at Pike Place Fish Market. I have a separate hamper for my laundry so my fish clothes don't make my regular clothes smell. My clothes smell like fresh fish, but ultimately they still smell like fish. I have tried SEVERAL sustainable and natural softeners and detergents and this is the first one that I really like that is at a price point that I can live with. This pairs really well with the lavender laundry detergent I used and my work clothes feel soft and smell great. If they work for my fish clothes, they will totally work for people with normal laundry! I recommend this and plan to use it over and over. Totally worth it!",

                "reviewText": "I love lavender. I use a laundry detergent called \"ZUM\" in a lavender scent (sold on Amazon, check it out, GOOD STUFF!). My washer is very efficient though and there isn't a lot of the scent left in the clothes or towels after. I wanted to build on Zum's lavender scent so I looked around at fabric softeners that were purely lavender scented. Reviews on this looked good so I bought 3 bottles. Smells good in the bottle. I added to my washer's softener area and expected more of the lavender infusion after the load of clothes was done. No, I couldn't tell any difference. And, to me, the clothes didn't have the usual softness I get just using over the counter Downey softeners. The next load was towels. I do like them SOFT. I decided to fill a \"Downey ball\" with this softener to give it more of a chance because of the sheer volume of liquid going in. My towels are NEVER hard! These felt UNTOUCHED by a softener product. I tried to convince myself to give it more of a try... but after doing more towels there's just no denying it... this product DOES NOT SOFTEN towels at all. And the lavender scent does not remain over what I get with just the ZUM detergent. I consider the product misrepresented and useless.",

I use wool dryer balls in the dryer and my clothes are just as soft and lint free as they were when using Downy or Gain fabric softeners.
