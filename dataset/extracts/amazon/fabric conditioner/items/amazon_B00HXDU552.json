The snuggle scent is really nice and these are so easy to just toss into the washer drum and everything smells great when done. I wash in cold water and often use a presoak which lets the wash sit in the water before the wash cycle and I've not had a problem with the sachets not dissolving. I find the quantity and price to be better than the beads. A good purchase.",

                "reviewText": "As any of you who have ever lived in an apartment without a washer and dryer can attest, laundry is hell.Since moving into a place with a washer and dryer, though, I have found that I love doing laundry! I experiment with different detergents, stain removers, scent boosters, and fabric softeners regularly.Before I purchased the Snuggle Laundry Boosters, I was using Downy Unstopables.These are considerably a better value than Downy Unstopables. Also, I can't tell you how many times I have accidentally spilled the Unstopables out of the lid and have had to clean little pink beads off my floor. With pods - no problem.More to the point, though, how do the smells compare?This is just my subjective evaluation, but I think Downy Unstopables (of any scent) smell slightly better than the Blue Iris scent of Snuggle. Both, however, smell very good.Downy Unstopables make clothes smell amazing right out of the washer, but drying on a high heat or for an extended period of time, in my experience, tends to diminish that smell. Snuggle Boosters, on the other hand, still smell good out of the dryer. The smell isn't as strong as right out of the washer, but I wasn't left wondering \"what happened to the smell?!\"So far I haven't had any problems with the pods melting on my clothes, nor have the pods left any stains. I have a front-loading stackable washer/dryer, if that makes a difference. This has happened to me before with other kinds of pods - I won't mention any brands - but I think what helps is not overloading the washer and running a longer wash cycle.When I do overload my washer, like with bedding, all pods tend to leave stains, so I'll wash and then do a short wash-rinse cycle without any more detergent or boosters. That almost always fixes it.I will be buying these again in other scents.",

You just grab a pod and throw it in there unlike the beads. Also, these seem to dissolve better than the beads. For whatever reason I had a few instances where the beads would dissolve completely and they\u2019d discolor my clothes.",
