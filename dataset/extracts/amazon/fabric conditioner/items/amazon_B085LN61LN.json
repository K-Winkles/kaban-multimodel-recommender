I always get compliments on things that I have washed with this product in it!",

They\u2019re definitely the most affordable option and I think the smell lasts longer than Downey and Gain. They don\u2019t even make it passed the dryer. This scent stays strong. It especially does if you hang dry. I will say the snuggle pods are better, but they\u2019re hard to find and super expensive! Overall these are good.",
