But, unfortunately, I have not really noticed any of my laundry having an extended smell past the dryer, I only use one per regular load of clothes and maybe that is why, most everyone I have known use at least 2 of the sheets to get a long lasting intensity in the load of laundry. So maybe it's just my box that I got. I don't know I haven't been one that added multiple sheets per regular load but that maybe the only thing to do to get the extended smell in the clothes I an searching for. \ud83e\udd14 Some people believe that you have to use the liquid fabric softner to get the best results.
