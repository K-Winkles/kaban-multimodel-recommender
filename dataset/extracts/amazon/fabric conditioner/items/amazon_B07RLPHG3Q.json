                "reviewText": "I absolutely love the smell of this and for the price and how much you get, you can't beat it. The smell definitely makes you feel like one of those commercials you see where you just want to sit and smell it. It's not overly strong but it's just such a fresh and pleasant smell. A little goes a long way too, you don't need to use a lot even for a larger load of laundry like your bath towels or bedsheets. I've used most brands; Downy, Gain, Tide, and NOTHING has even come close to the smell you get with this. In fact most other brands you barely smell anything even if you use the matching set of detergent and fabric softener. The only downside is that it doesn't get stuff quite as soft as other brands but overall I would purchase it again.",
