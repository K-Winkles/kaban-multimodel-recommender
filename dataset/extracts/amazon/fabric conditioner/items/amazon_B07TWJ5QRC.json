The smell is a soft clean smell that does not assault the senses but does smell clean. When the garments are placed on hangers or folded timely, except for certain 100% cotton linen and similar fabrics always requiring some ironing; the wrinkles will fall out with no ironing with proper hanging. It is the best quality fabric treatment I have tried.",
