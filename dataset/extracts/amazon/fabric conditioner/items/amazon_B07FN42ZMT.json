They can't clean your high performance fabrics. HEX was built to get deep into these tightly woven fabrics to clean out all the gunk and buildup other detergents leave behind. So, if your clothes, towels and gear still smell, it's not you, it's your detergent. Protection: The New Clean HEX removes odors and keeps them out. We don't cover them up with fragrance. Say goodbye to stains, odors, and static and hello to wickability, stretch, softness, and color curtesy of our protective barrier. HEX has redefined what it means to be clean. It's not enough to smell good right out of the laundry. Your clothes and gear need to keep smelling and feeling fresh and clean, even after your workout. In Addition too Clean, It's Green Most traditional detergents either compromise on cleaning power or on eco-friendliness. We don't think either is ok. That's why everything in HEX is carefully engineered to be sustainable. And it's in a 100% recyclable plastic bottle, with a concentrated formula that fits into a smaller bottle, to save on shipping.",

                "reviewText": "This product works so well that I am almost suspicious: are the underlying chemicals turning me into a mutant?! OK, I am a 230 lb fattie who exercises 2-3 hours/day, sometimes in 100F heat. In other words, I sweat like a pig (unfair to pigs actually since I inevitably SOAK my exercise clothes far beyond what any pig could sweat). I was stinking to the point of having to soak my clothes in detergent DURING my post-exercise shower...then using the most powerful wash setting in the washing machine with DOUBLE the amount of typical detergent...and sometimes even then I had to do a second round in the washing machine with another cup of detergent. In other words, I was pushing my old detergent to the limits, and it wasn't getting it done. I used about 5-6 tablespoons (i.e., a miniscule amount) of HEX with a WEEK's worth of the grossest, sweat-drenched exercise clothes on the planet on the LOWEST, cold-water wash setting, and, within 20-30 minutes, the clothes were the cleanest they've been since I bought them. Hence why I am now skeptical...it works too well. Is it dissolving my skin now?! Anyway, assuming it doesn't kill me, this is the most incredible detergent I've ever bought, and I don't think I will ever go back to \"regular\" laundry detergent. From the label, this is apparently SAFER for you and BETTER for the environment, and if that is indeed the case, this detergent will replace all others within 5-10 years.To emphasize its magic even further. Today, I went for a grueling jog, stunk like hell, came back, and, as I was about to take a shower, I noticed my bottle of Hex was open. As I went to close it, I splattered some on my hands. Not wanting to waste it, I rubbed it on the front of my gross, sweaty shirt. After a few hours (having forgotten this), I went to do laundry, and I noticed that the front of my jogging shirt (where I rubbed the Hex) smelled totally fine/clean/like new. The back (where I did NOT rub any Hex in) smelled atrocious. I have no idea how it works so well, and I almost don't want to know!",

This product amazingly seems to do the trick. I no longer smell the lingering scent of past sweat and it really seems to have neutralized it altogether. Expensive? Yes. But if you want to preserve and extend the life of your gear, this seems a small price to pay.",

                "reviewText": "I see there are so many people here that are upset at the change. I bought a 2 pack of this detergent a while ago and loved it. It has a light scent that is pleasant and not overpowering, and it cleans well. The small bottles are (or rather were!) easy for me to handle. I just got my next delivery via subscribe and save and they changed the design. Why?? It used to be a slim, easy to hold bottle with a measuring cap built in. Now it's a perfectly round bottle with no easy way to grasp it, and the measuring cup is a separate thing that's just included in the box. I do laundry in my building's laundry room, so how am I supposed to bring a used measuring cup that is dripping with detergent back to my apartment? What was wrong with the mainstream feature of having the cap be the measuring cup, and let the detergent that coats the sides flow back into the bottle? For now, I am going to transfer the new detergent into my one remaining bottle, but I will not buy this brand again. Which makes me sad.",

I live in Canada and the cost of Hex (from Amazon) works out to be $1.65 Cdn per pod or $3.30 Cdn per load.
