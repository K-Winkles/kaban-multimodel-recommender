The only negative is that the \u201cIntense\u201d line of Downy costs more than regular Downy softeners and is frequently sold-out on Amazon. However, the fragrance is awesome and it lasts. Using it on bedding and other laundry items that are stored away in a cupboard/closet makes it worth the extra cost as sheets smell fresh & clean weeks later.",
