Initially, I joked to my boyfriend that it smells like they watered down fabric softener and sold it in bottles on Amazon for $15 a piece! Lol But the thing is, the reason for docking a star, is that the scent lasts only 5-10 mins, and then it dissipates. You essentially have to spray it every 10 minutes to keep smelling it \u2014 kinda like those Glade Automatic sprayer things \u2014 and so that\u2019s what I propose: please manufacture this scent to be used in one of the automatic sprayers utilizing compressed liquid. The scent is incredible, refreshing and lovely. I\u2019ve used it in the car and at home. I just wish I could smell it more frequently without having to spray it manually. Highly recommend this product if you like your space to smell clean and fresh! Great mood booster!",
