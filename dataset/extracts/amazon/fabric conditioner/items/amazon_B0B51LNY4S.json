I LOVE That these are a fraction of the price of others.So far so good!***2 week update*** So, I LOVE these!!! they work so well, my washer has plenty of bubbles, my clothes look and smell clean. I also love that they take almost no space.I bought these just to try, (I'm such a sucker to try new things) but they will likely be replacing my normal detergent.",

Better than bargain detergent but you will use 2 to 4 per load. I found that if you add borax (1/4) cup per load this work REALLY GOOD by lowering the waters PH and allowing the soap to work better. Borax alone or these sheets alone work like bargain detergent but combine and with my water it works like a champ. Using 2-3 per load and adding 3 oz (1/4 cup) of borax. Buy the borax on line!",

                "reviewText": "So i love the fact that its not packaged in plastic, how ever im not so sure if its what im looking for. So far ive started out using just 1 sheet but after watching the load of laundry I didnt really see any suds, so i moved to 2 pads of the soap and it was a little better. Overall my clothes were clean and the smell was ok.So for 200 loads id say if you are washing maybe up to 5 items of clothing its good but after that you are using more sheets of the soap. Great concept though.",

                "reviewText": "First, I love the packaging. My \"mature\" fingers & joints can get into it easily & painlessly. The package is recyclable.Second, very easy to use, dissolves quickly, even in cold water. You may have to experiment with the number of sheets, because how much soap you need to clean your particular filth is highly subjective. For an office worker or an inside-oriented human, 1-2 will probably work fine. For really active, outdoorsy, or hard-working (in a physical sense) folks, you're gonna need more--up to 4 sheets. Also, your water type & washing machine type figures in as well. For soft water, less. For water approximating liquid stone (like ours), more.In other words, before bagging on this very good product, use the \"recommended\" number of sheets as a guideline, & experiment for your own situation. Where the heck else are you going to find this generous number of sheets for this reasonable price? Other brands are certainly full of themselves with their $35 for 56 loads price tag. This one does what it's supposed to do, & well when you figure out your ratios, for a considerably more reasonable price, especially for folks on fixed incomes or lower income situations who still have a heart for stewardess resources, both fiscal & environmental.However.... Why is there no ingredients list available for this product? I've looked everywhere & all I can find are general statements of \"eco-friendly\" \"no harsh chemicals\" \"95% plant-based active ingredients \" & the like. Even on the box it's disturbingly vague: \"washing auxiliary detergent\" & \"antibacterial factor\". I can find nothing that specifically says it is septic system safe, or whether just the container or the soap itself is biodegradable. I would really feel a LOT more comfortable with this product if the specific ingredients & specific items that are biodegradable were plainly & transparently listed.Overall, happy with the price, the effective cleaning, the quantity of sheets to allow flexibility in the number needed per level of crud on our clothing. Dissatisfied & suspicious of lack of specific listing of ingredients & vagueness of info on box & site.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these in late November. It's now late January, and I JUST ran out. I do laundry all the time, including laundry soiled by cat pee, and these were just as good as any bottled detergent I've used--which don't last nearly as long.For the heavily soiled ones, I use three of these, plus some vinegar or Oxiclean to make sure the smells and stains are out. Like I said, cat pee, which is the devil's substance. But for normal soil, these work great on their own.I think part of why this works so well is that the instructions about how many to use are so clear and less wasteful.I've only had one instance of them not totally dissolving. I fix this by tearing them up into four or so pieces, which I spread throughout the laundry. This works whether I'm using one or using three sheets.There isn't a smell, which is great. I'm also severely allergic to pretty much any detergent, and I've had no issues with this.",
