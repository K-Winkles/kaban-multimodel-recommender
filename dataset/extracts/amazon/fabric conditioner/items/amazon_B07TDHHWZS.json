These smell wonderful and I highly recommend them.",

                "reviewText": "The scent of this fabric softener completely disappears in the dryer. It serves no purpose other than to soften the clothes. I thought it would make my towels and pajamas smell like lavender but I had no such luck. Very softening, however, and the price is competitive and favorable indeed. I also noticed that the sheets were a little bit shorter and not as thick as some other popular brands. I adored the smell and only wish it lasted longer. This definitely wasn't due to the laundry itself because it wasn't very soiled or unclean to begin with. The flap to open and close the box isn't very tight and could be formulated to tuck the box more tightly together so that the sheets stay fresh and free of any dust or moisture in your laundry room or else from the laundromat you're visiting.",
