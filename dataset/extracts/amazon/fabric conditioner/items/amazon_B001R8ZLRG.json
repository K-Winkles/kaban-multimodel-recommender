It's a bit of old lady house smell to me. I was shocked to see the small size of the pouches for the amount paid. I would never re-order this product. I personally like the smell and it lasts a long time. I put one in my towel closet and each time I open it the smell comes out. I may bit the bullet and order the expensive clothes soap?",
