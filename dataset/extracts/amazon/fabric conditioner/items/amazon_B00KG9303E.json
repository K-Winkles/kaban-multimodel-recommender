                "reviewText": "First time trying this fabric softener and I love it! Water here is very hard and without a fabric softener (that is of a more organic nature, in keeping with our natural/organic lifestyle), my sensitive skin really suffers terrible itchiness when wearing any of my washed items. This softener has remedied that, while also being far less chemical than its counterparts like Downy and such, no synthetic scent either, and truly keeps my fabrics soft - my skin is thankful! The cost is a tad high, though we're accustomed to 'organic' or natural products costing more (unfortunately)...we'd prefer it were less, but overall don't mind the extra cost when considering our experience with the product. Thus far I've tried the Neroli/Sea Salt and like it a lot. Just ordered Ginger/Pomelo to see how I like its scent. Will continue using Caldrea, for sure!!",

The scent is delightful, and what\u2019s even better is that it lingers, keeping my laundry smelling fresh for a long time. The fact that it\u2019s organic is a big plus for me, knowing that it\u2019s a more natural choice.My only reservation is the price. It\u2019s a bit on the expensive side compared to other options on the market. However, for those who prioritize organic and long-lasting freshness, it might be worth the investment.Overall, it\u2019s a fantastic product that I genuinely enjoy using, but the cost does give me pause. \ud83c\udf3f\ud83c\udf38\ud83d\udc5a #FreshLaundry #OrganicChoice #ScentSensation",

Unless I stick my nose to my shirt I can't smell anything. If I do, yes, it smells pretty good (but faintly).My shirts are much software now. We'll see how it manages static once the temperatures start to drop but I imagine it'll do fine.Overall I like it.",
