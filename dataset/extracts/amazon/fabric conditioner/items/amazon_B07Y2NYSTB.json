I first tried the instructions, point by point. Nope. The instructions indicate it should open with a simple push and twist.... which led to breaking my natural nail off, but not opening the egg. Apparently, the company thinks this egg is from a golden goose, so is protected by the highest security.I alternately have tried using the back of a spoon, a blunt knife handle, and a chopstick to depress the latch button. I am still denied access.Imagining what it would be like for an older person, or physically challenged person, to attempt this simple task triggers sympathy and anxiety.Annnyywaaay.

                "reviewText": "Ho acquistato questo ecoegg un po' scettica, infatti ho scelto il formato da 70 lavaggi per spendere meno e provarlo. Dopo 2 mesi di utilizzo sono molto soddisfatta e sicuramente una volta esaurito comprer\u00f2 la ricarica. Il bucato con ecoegg risulta pulito e morbido senza l'utilizzo di alcun additivo, anche se personalmente utilizzo ancora un poco di detersivo in caso di carichi di lavatrice particolarmente abbondanti e/o sporchi. Il consumo di detersivo \u00e8 comunque ridotto drasticamente.Per chi \u00e8 abituato ad usare l'ammorbidente, probabilmente dovr\u00e0 continuare a farlo, perch\u00e9 comunque il bucato non esce cos\u00ec profumato e morbido. Essendo io attenta dal punto di vista ecologico e salutistico, non ho mai usato ammorbidente o profumatori, e li ho sostituiti solo con acido citrico diluito al 10% per avere comunque capi morbidi. Devo dire che da quando uso ecoegg il bucato esce ben pi\u00f9 \"ammorbidito\" rispetto a prima.Per riassumere, ecoegg funziona molto bene, ma per esserne davvero soddisfatti bisogna rinunciare a certa chimica dei detersivi e ammorbidenti per fare una scelta pi\u00f9 ecologica e salutare, solo cos\u00ec si apprezzer\u00e0 un bucato pulito e sicuro, e non profuatissimo morbidissimo e dannodissimo.",

I will try dirty cloths just to see how well it works and maybe give another review a little later but so far happy enough with product and I like the economy side of it and it's good for the environment so win win \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d",
