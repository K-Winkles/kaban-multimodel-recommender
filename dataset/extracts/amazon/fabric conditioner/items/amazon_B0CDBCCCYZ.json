It didn't look like anything came out of it though, the seal was still on it so I added seran wrap plastic ontop with a rubber band around, just so I can reuse this. I haven't tried it yet but I'm excited that they have this stain remover- their discontinued bleach alternative worked really well for removing menstrual stains for my reusable cotton pads, which is important so I can see how my flow is against the white. I just fill a small bucket with water and a bleach/stain remover that won't harm my bare hands so I can push my used pad in there to soak before each laundry load.",
