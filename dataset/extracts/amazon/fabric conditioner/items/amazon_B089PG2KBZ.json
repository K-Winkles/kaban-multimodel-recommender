I would have to rewash that garment multiple times b4 the softener spot would eventually come out. (Keep in mind this may be an issue with my softener dispenser, my washer isn\u2019t the newest lol) With that being said though, I love these beads because I don\u2019t have that issue when using them. They dissolve well in the wash and leave no residue. I still get silky soft, fresh smelling clothes without worrying about those pesky softener stains. If you\u2019re on the fence, don\u2019t be. Just try them and see for yourself.",

                "reviewText": "TL;DR If you're unsure about buying these beads like I was, give them a try.I'm not generally a fan of laundry additives. Until now, I've been happy washing with Tide Pods Ultra Oxi and drying with Bounce Pet Hair Mega Sheets. This stuff was on sale and the positive reviews seemed genuine so I took a shot and, boy, am I glad I did. I have a couple sets of Wamsutta Turkish cotton towels that are five years old, and I was thinking about replacing them since they weren't as soft as they were when I bought them. After one wash with the Downy Defy Damage beads they are absolutely, noticeably softer. The same goes for my two-year old DreamFit Egyptian cotton sheet sets; they feel softer than they ever have.I haven't noticed as much of a softness difference with my \"unmentionables\"; my boxers, socks and tees feel pretty much the same, but time will tell if additional washes with the beads make a difference. I can't attest to Downy's claims of reducing stretching and fading since I just started using the beads. But I plan on using them from now on, especially for my sheets and towels. Some reviews complained about the strong fresh scent but I find it pleasant and not at all overpowering. Some reviews also mentioned that the beads didn't fully dissolve; I have had no issue with that in my top-loading Whirlpool HE washer on both cool and warm wash settings. I always wash with two rinse cycles, so maybe that has something to do with it.",
