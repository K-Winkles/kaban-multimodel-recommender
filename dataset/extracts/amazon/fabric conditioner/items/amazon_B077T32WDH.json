                "reviewText": "I have a variety of triathlon wetsuits that I use during the year. They go in a variety of different bodies of water, and do not get regularly cleaned during the summer. However, I try and keep the neoprene in good shape so the wetsuits last. At the end of each season, I buy a wetsuit shampoo and fully clean all the wetsuits.This product seems to do a good job. I put all the wetsuits in the bathtub and fill it with lukewarm water. I soak the wetsuits in water, then add the shampoo. This shampoo is easy to add and mixes will with the water. It suds up easily and seems to really penetrate the neoprene. I leave the wetsuits to soak for a while, then rinse them out.My main concern with the shampoo is that it ca be very hard to get out of the fabric and neoprene. It typically takes many additional washes and soaks before the water stops bubbling. This is the bulk of the effort. However, this also shows that the shampoo is really cleaning the wetsuit, so it is a price worth paying.Once the wetsuits are cleaned and fried, I feel comfortable storing them for the winter, and they are always soft and ready for the next summer. I have also used this product on swim skins, and I had similar results.",

I used this in a tub of warm water and dang if it didn\u2019t turn the water brown from the nastiness of the covers. I\u2019ll be doing this yearly, and extend the life of the covers. I\u2019m also using the odor eliminator along with the shampoo.",

I filled a clear storage tote tub with warm water and put appx 1-2 tablespoons in it. I let my wetsuit marinade in it for 10-15 mins. I then rinsed it in the bathtub and hung dry. It looks and smells like a new wet suit!I also washed my NRS neoprene booties, socks and water gloves in it. Same result!Tip: After I washed my booties, water socks and gloves in the solution I put them in the washer on RINSE & SPIN cycle. Worked great!Overall I\u2019m impressed and it\u2019s a great value and super fast shipping.",

                "reviewText": "Got a used wetsuit online and after a few washes with this stuff the suit looked and felt brand new. I did let the suit soak for ~15mins and rinsed it (although directions says its not needed). I only needed a small amount of the shampoo and will be using the rest to clean my other wetsuits and to refresh them at the end of the season. Highly recommend if you have wetsuits, seems like it will help extend their life and get rid of the grime/crust after a season in the ocean.",
