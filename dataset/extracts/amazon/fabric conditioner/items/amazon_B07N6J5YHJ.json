                "reviewText": ".. In search for a good quality laundry product with epic scent, I took a shot in the dark and ordered my first Frey products last year. \"Try before you buy\" is kinda something I prefer... or smell before you buy in this case, however the ratings were great and I ordered through Amazon, so worst case, I could send it back. I was BLOWN away by how incredible the black label combo smelled! Wondering how it would stand up to a good wash and dry, I was even more impressed that the scent lingered for a few days on my sheets. I found myself actually squirting a small amount of the scent booster and using it as perfume! No shame here! Anyhow, fast forward to my most recent order... I was heavy hearted when I signed in to Amazon for a Re-UP, and my black label scent booster was not available!! I didn't like the sound of the scents in the white label one, however I took a leap of faith and ordered anyhow. I just received my package... and OMG... I have a new second love! The black label is still my #1, however this new beauty definitely has a place in my heart! Not only do these products SMELL amazing, they do their job in the wash... They also make you feel good. I ordered the shampoo, body wash, and deodorant this go-round as well, and I will leave honest feedback about them all when I try them. As a female, I have a hard time finding things within my scent pallet that resonate and 'do the trick'... you, my friends, have killed it in every department so far!",

                "reviewText": "I have been using this Fabric Softener for a little over a year now. At first I was hesitant to write a review because I could not tell exactly how effective the product was. I decided to try a little different approach by adding a few more pumps depending on what I was washing. For clothing, I use about 8-9 pumps on medium size loads and started to notice a big difference. I also use about 12-15 on blankets. Now, I personally think that the thicker the material you are washing, the more it will hold the scent. I originally ordered this product to be used on clothes, but instead became obsessed with using it to wash my blankets, sheets, etc. It provides a longer lasting effect on those type of material and you can even tell the difference on sweatshirts/sweaters. I highly recommend this product to friends because everyone tends to ask me how I was able to get my blankets to smell so good. If you are more focused/concerned with giving your clothes a fresher scent, I highly recommend trying FREY's Universal Freshener. I spray that on clothing a few times a week that are just hanging up in the closet or inside a bureau. It gives that little extra \"oomph\" to your clothes and prevents it from getting that musty odor!",

They listed all the scents this contained, that I love in higher end colognes. Bought for my husbands laundry. Have to add double the pumps to even smell it, and by that time, it\u2019s way too much. Smells nothing more than cheap men\u2019s cologne that you buy in box stores. Had no softening abilities either that I could tell. This review has nothing to do with Amazon, this is all on Frey. If you think you still want to try it, buy those small sample sized bottles first. I really wasted my money on These.",

                "reviewText": "I am all about scents, I do not like them in my face and over whelming, but in the back ground almost like you have to stop and smell again because you got a hint of it. That is what the Frey product does, when I first received this and smelled it I was like OHHHH way to strong I am not going to like it, but I used it and it is not like it at all, it is concentrated so go by directions, I did not want to put that little in but I did AND IT WORKED!!! With my first wash the scent was soft and very nice, my clothes , towels and sheets were very soft to the touch, I was amazed. Also things with scents seem to be harsh on the skin, this is not at all so now your clothes can smell wonderful without having to worry about breakouts (or that is the case with me and my very sensitive grand kids).",

While the scent in the bottle is spot on, i do not smell it, in the least, on the clothes. Plus, it says to use 10 pumps on extra large loads. At this rate, they'll be finished in no time. Way to expensive for what you get.",

                "reviewText": "This is easily the best softener I've ever used. I've been looking for a scented fabric softener that was targeted to males and I was excited and a little sceptical when I found this. However, after using it a few times I can honestly say that I found the holy grail of fabric softeners for men.The scent is perfect! It's not too weak and not too strong. I was a bit nervous that it was going to be overkill when I placed the order. At 35, I didn't want to smell like a high schooler that drenched myself in Axe body spray \ud83d\ude02. But I couldn't be happier with the scent and quality of the product.I would rate it a 98/\ud83d\udcaf. Simply because it was slightly less effective than my current softener (Downy wrinkle release - unscented) but smells 20 times better.",
