                "reviewText": "I purchased a few of these containers on sale a few months ago. Not sure why, but I hadn't tried it until this past weekend. I ended up using it on all 6 bedding and towel loads. I LOVE that is dissolves easily and rinses easily and creates no bubbles that require extra rinsing. There is not much of a scent to it, but everything smells clean and fresh when done. Best part is that I don't have to wait until the rinse cycle and then pause the machine like other products. Arm & Hammer got it right with this product! EASY. Add it in at the beginning of the cycle with your detergent and let it go do it's thing.About the container....I don't know why so many people have a problem with it. It is secure so nothing will come out from shipping. To open it, you squeeze the tabs toward each other and turn counter clockwise (left)",
