                "reviewText": "I dislike the cheap scents that are put in most laundry detergents and this product is totally unscented and hypoalergenic. The sheets conveniently fit into a drawer in the laundary room, are inexpensive compared to the big brand laundry detergents (whose price includes a pretty hefty advertising budget), and work well getting my laundry clean.Some of the very few negative reviews for this product complain about no \"suds\" and no \"clean\" scent.First, detergents help water dissolve oils and dirt so that they can be removed from fabrics. The \"suds\" of commercial laundary detergents come from added chemicals to imitate soap suds. Suds do not clean better and this product doesn't contain chemicals to make fake soap suds.Second, \"clean\" does not have a scent. It usually means the absence of odor. Commercial laundry detergents often add artificial scents that some people confuse with being clean.",

Smells good. No complaints. I mix it with oxyclean for washing clothes and sometimes some borax for items that have real bad stains on them. Plus side, it's compact. Wrapping is paper instead of unrecyclable plastic",

I tear the sheets into tiny pieces and add to the laundry machine and it gets everything nice and clean. Those complaining about the lack of scent making them feel like their clothes aren't clean should add some essential oils or get some scent boosters or something. These sheets get body odor, onion and garlic scents, and pet odors out leaving my clothes smelling clean with no odors. They are clean with no scent and that is great!",

Economical, and seems to clean better with the first three washings. getting used to putting in dry sheets; kinda wierd at first but I am a committed user now. No more hauling lquids!!I have since seen my first tv commercial for this type of product, so it is becoming more available.",
