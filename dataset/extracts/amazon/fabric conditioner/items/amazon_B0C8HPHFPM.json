When I saw this LAVOIR fabric conditioner that uses only plant-derived ingredients I ordered it to try.The bottle is cute and when I unscrew the top cover, there is a safety seal foil that protects the liquid inside from contamination or accidental spill.True to what it claimed my skin did not get any irritation when it came in contact with the underwear I was wearing. The fabric like my denim pants feels softer with minimal wrinkles, plus I love the floral but non-irritating scent that lingers and seems long-lasting.Overall am happy with this fabric conditioner. Highly recommended if you have sensitive skin but still want to wear fresh-smelling clothes.",

I used just a capful in a standard load of towels in my washer along with a detergent sheet and they came out smelling fresh and much lighter of a scent than the bottle sniff test would suggest. I never use dryer sheets with the towels and it didn't perform much differently than the major brands for towels - they are moderately fluffy from the softener, and a very light scent after drying on high. The next day, the towels had very little scent remaining, which is OK by me but if you're wanting something that continues to have that scent you may want to look elsewhere.",

This bottle is 16.9 fluid ounces, and the amount to use for a large load is 25ml, which is about 1.75 tablespoons. Please note there is no measuring device included. So this bottle will soften approximately 20 loads for the cost of $25/bottle.Now as I read the bottle there is a warning that I found very frightening. It is as follows: CHILDREN. [WARNING] Do not use this product. On Fluffier fabrics such as fleece or terry cloth as it may increase the flammability of these fabrics. On children's sleepwear or other garments labeled as flame resistant as it may reduce the flame resistance.I do not have children in my home, but still I found that warning to be unsettling. I did use the softener on my dish towels, some terry and some cotton. They all came out soft with little to no scent. I was not impressed at all.I do not recommend this fabric softener at all.",

                "reviewText": "I washed a set of king sized sheets to test this out- one flat sheet, one fitted sheet, and 4 pillowcases. I used about 25 mL of the product in the fabric softener compartment of my washing machine. I used a 2 hour white cycle with hot water and regular unscented laundry detergent.After washing and machine drying, the sheets came out soft but without any noticeable fragrance to them. I was a little disappointed since the scent was nice in the bottle but it didn't really transfer to the sheets. I did feel that the sheets were soft and smooth, though, which is nice.Overall, I think this fabric softener softens but there may not be much meaning to it being fragranced. The scent in the bottle is a nice, slightly feminine floral. It's more sweet than herbal, but again, may not matter much if it doesn't make it onto the laundry.",

                "reviewText": "Being picky about laundry products pays off! As my daughter used to have sensitivities to detergents, I'm meticulous in my choices. I first tested this detergent on my own clothes. While the bottle suggests 25ml for a regular load as it's a super concentrated fabric softener, there's no measuring cup provided. Resourceful me repurposed a small measuring cup from cough medicine (thankfully not discarded!). In both uses, the clothes came out beautifully soft, with no overpowering scent - perfect for sensitive individuals. I truly appreciate the company's dedication to environmental responsibility, leaving no residue and using 100% recycled post-consumer plastic for their containers.",

                "reviewText": "This fabric softener would be perfect for people who have sensitive skin or dislike strongly scented laundry products. It's got a very light floral scent when you smell it in the cute pink and white bottle. I used the amount suggested which was much less than my usual fabric softener. It would be great if the cap could be used for measuring. I had to bring a measuring cup down to the basement and kind of guesstimate on how much to use since the instructions are different in the USA. The fabric softener did a good job of making a load of bath towels soft and fluffy. The scent didn't stay in the towels. I used it with unscented laundry sheets. This is supposed to have less chemicals and I'm all for that.",

                "reviewText": "The pros are obvious - a great scent, somewhat conscientious ingredients, and relatively easy to use.The primary negative is use, specifically measuring the correct amount. Perhaps this is nitpicky, but it requires you measure the amount by using your pre-existing measuring spoons (20 ml or 1.35 tablespoons). Ideally, a product will make use of the cap to accomplish this step.Overall, it meets its purpose and smells great.",

                "reviewText": "The Fabric softener smells good in the bottle but after using the recommend amount with a small load of towels there was virtually no fragrance on the towels. The instructions say to use 20ml for a regular size load. 20ml is approximately two table spoons. Since they give you no way to dispense the fabric softener I used the cap for measuring which is about a table spoon. I used three cap full for a load that included two bath towels and three hand towels. The towels did feel soft but I was disappointed in the lack of fragrance especially since the product in the bottle smelled good. LAVOIR Perfumed Fabric Conditioner is currently on Amazon for $25 dollars. That is WAY overpriced.",
