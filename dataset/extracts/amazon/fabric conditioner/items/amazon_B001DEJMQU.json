With your first soak in Eucalan, you should likely see the water in the wash basin turn a bit brown. The soap releases dirt into the wash basin, & though the clothing absorbs a little of the soap, it is beneficial. Lanolin fortifies & conditions clothing fibres - particularly great for woolens & knits, but can be used on most anything. Scented with only pure essential oils, some of them contain long-term cleaning properties that are intended to remain in the clothing to further benefit from; Think swim suits & lingerie that lie close to the skin, or blankets & knitted sweaters that get packed away for the cold months. Eucalan\u2019s no-rinse formula is also convenient \u2013 great for travel when you\u2019re not likely to have a washing machine, or are seeking to conserve water. If you feel the urge to rinse, it is safe to do so. The soap has done its job of cleaning, though you will lose the lasting effects of the lanolin & essential oils.",

It's a much better value, and I intend to use it to wash my woolens. I particularly like that it's very gentle and doesn't need to be rinsed.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Comparison to The Laundress New York Wool and Cashmere Shampoo and Soak Wash!",
                "reviewText": "As a hand knitter, blocking is an important technique in getting your hand knitted items into a desired shape by redistributing the stitches, without stretching it out or damaging the fibers. Plain water can be used for this purpose but to keep the natural fibers soft and to preserve the natural lanolin oils found in theses fibers, a wool wash is more efficient.I have purchased and used this item, along with The Laundress Wool & Cashmere Shampoo, Cedar, 16 fl. oz. \u2013 32 loads and Soakwash Liquid Laundry Wash, 12-Ounce, Scentless . Here is my comparison of all three items:1. Eucalan Delicate Wash Wrapture \u2013 JasmineThis is a no rinse wash that contains a touch of lanolin to naturally condition fibers. I used this wash on several Lopapeysas that I hand knitted with scratchy Icelandic wool. I simply poured about 2 capfuls per gallon of cold water and let the sweater sit overnight. I squeezed it out and laid flat to dry (on a blocking mat) the next day (shaping if necessary).This wash was perfect in softening the wool and gave it a light jasmine scent. Grade A+2. The Laundress New York Wool and Cashmere Shampoo \u2013 CedarThis is a highly concentrated wool and cashmere shampoo that contains lanolin and cedar extracts. I also used this wash on hand knitted Lopapeysas and a fisherman\u2019s sweater for my husband. I did the same process using about 2 capfuls per gallon of cold water and let the sweater sit overnight, however, this shampoo (it\u2019s sudsy and soapy), requires rinsing. I rinsed with cold water until it ran clear then squeezed it out and laid flat to dry (on a blocking mat) the next day (shaping if necessary).I also recommend this shampoo for washing (cleaning) wool items that have been soiled or sweaty. It works wonderfully on my husband and children\u2019s ski wool items and base layers.This wash was perfect in softening the wool and giving it a lovely cedar \u201cwoodsy\u201d smell that is perfect for the \u201cmanly\u201d man yet still subtle and feminine for the \u201cgirly\u201d girl! Grade A+3. Soak Wash for Hand Knits \u2013 ScentlessThis is a gentle no rinse formula that\u2019s phosphate free and perfect for people with sensitive skin or sensitive noses! I use this for all my hand knitted baby and children\u2019s items (form socks and hats to sweaters and blankets) and hand knitted items I give as gifts. I think this one would be perfect for other delicate items such as lingerie.I follow the same method, as with the other washes (soak, squeeze and rinse, lay flat to dry).This wash was perfect in providing the softness without the fragrance! Grade A+NoteI cannot comment on how any of these washes/shampoos preform on machine washed items as I\u2019ve only done them by hand.None of my items have shrunk using any of the above washes/shampoos.I highly recommend any of the above three for your wool, cashmere, or natural fiber items!",

                "reviewText": "I recently bought this to use for my cresta wool leggings and after I washed them they were so soft and smelled so amazing. I decided to try it on my flannel shirts because washing them in regular detergent always makes them feel rough to the touch. I was absolutely thrilled at how super soft the shirts felt after washing them. I have also used it on cashmere and sherpa fleece. It works great on everything. I will never use regular laundry detergent for any of those items again.I use either the rinse cycle or the delicate cycle on my front load washer with a tsp or less of the product depending on how many and what type of items I'm washing, and it leaves everything feeling, looking and smelling amazing. I love it.",

                "reviewText": "I have a fine-tuned nose and the lavender scent IS very strong if you are the type of person (like me) who has cut any artificial fragrances or strong smells out of their home. Re: no perfume, air fresheners, fake scents in soap, detergent, etc etc. the only scents I use in products are essential oil based, which are usually pretty mild/not long lasting. If you're like me and don't use chemically-based scented products, the smell of this on your clothes may feel like a perfumey assault to the senses. I cannot imagine wearing a sweater that was washed in this. It would be way too much. I have a hard time believing the smell is ONLY lavender essential oil as they claim because it just smells well, different and more intense than lavender essential oil. And trust me, I use a lot of that stuff. I am using this cleaner for wool diaper covers and at first the smell is too much for me...I really hate that after putting a cover on my babe, my hands smell like this lavender perfume smell for a long time. And like I said, not like the fresh, simple natural lavender smell either. BUT after a week of use of the wool covers, the smell fades and I feel somewhat grateful that the wools don't stink and still smell lightly pleasant. So I do think it might masks the urine smell a bit more than unscented would...but I have only used this one so don't have a lot to compare to. My next bottle I'll probably get unscented to try it out...and maybe add my own scent. If anybody gets any info on if there truly is an additional scent added in here, I'd love to know.Update: after months of use, the smell (surprise) really doesn't bother me anymore...Not sure if I've grown accustomed to it or it's because I find I am able to use less soap than I was initially. Still liking this product, and happy that a little goes a long way with this bottle.",
