                "reviewText": "This product does everything it says it does! One time, I had left clothes in the washer for days, the smell was god awful. No matter how many times I washed my clothes with everything under the sun..vinigar, baking soda with and without vinegar, oxy clean, dawn dish soap, etc. if google or YouTube said it would work I tried it and none of them worked. I thought I was going to have to throw away $1,000 or more worth of clothes, bc of course it was as many clothes as I could fit in the dang washer!! Then a commercial came on for this stuff, I was like yeah right if baking soda and vinegar didn't work nothing would. So I start reading reviews and I thought \"what the heck, what's the worst that could happen\" ladies and gentlemen, not only did that nasty smell come out of those clothes but they were soft and had a light scent instead of a strong powerful one. I'm almost out and I bought it at the beginning of summer. They have a faithful customer for the rest of my life. I 100% recommend it for whatever funk you need to get out!",

                "reviewText": "The sent is very light yet fixes strong bo issues and removes mildew musty smell. The bottle design is horrible. It's hard to hold and pour. It says to use 1/4 cup but comes with nothing to measure it in. I took my previous downy softener lid and measured 1/4 cup in it, which is line 2 if you want to use it. Because the bottle is so fat with nowhere to grip, I have to use two hands to pour. I have knocked the cup in the washer twice trying to measure out the needed amount and I am only halfway through the bottle. P&G have a unique product but they need to send the packaging back to R&D. I had set this up for reorder because I loved the sample I got but I am likely to cancel it because of the struggles with the bottle.",

I have also set up a subscription for it to continuously use it in my laundry.You add this to each wash cycle in the softener area. It really does make your clothes smell significantly better especially sport clothing or the underarm area of shirts. It doesn\u2019t seem to mask the smell but instead it seems to work directly on breaking down the bad smell areas.This product does not irritate our skin and it is also not too fragrant that it would be irritating. It smells fresh but not flowery or anything like that. My husband likes the smell so that says a lot as he can be pretty opinionated about smells.You do not feel this product on your clothing. It does not leave any residue on the clothing.Very happy with this product!",
