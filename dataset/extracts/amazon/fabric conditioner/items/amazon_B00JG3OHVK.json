If it doesn't meet these criteria, then I will most definitely and descriptively tell the short comings of the products and you as a consumer will not have to go through the trouble of buying the product without some background knowledge. If the sell pulls that item and relists under another description, I will put the exact same review on the seller's feedback page.

                "reviewText": "I am using this to replace scotch guard to waterproof my fishing rain gear. The problem with scotch guard is that the propellant (if you will) is water and if there is any water repellency left in the garment the stuff won't soak in so the fabric ends up soaking up water in an extended rain. The 303 has a petrochemical propellant and so does soak into the fabric. So far the application is easy (due to the soaking in) and the durability is superior.9/10/14 I recently spent an extended period in the rain fishing with a newer raincoat treated with 303. With the newer raincoats the fabric breathes but is supposedly waterproof. This is not entirely true. In an extended rain the fabric does not leak but is does saturate or soak into the fabric but does not leak through the fabric. If you are wearing cotton base clothing under the raincoat that clothing gets damp and there goes your insulating factor and your comfort. Obviously you would rather not have the rain soaking in (maybe OK in and umbrella but not so in a coat). That's why having the 303 soak into the fabric is such a big deal. So to the performance, the raingear did not leak and for the most part did not exhibit and signs of water soaking into the fabric. The exception was in areas of high wear or abrasion such as knee area of pants where you might lean an elbow for support. It may be that I didn't do a good job of spraying those areas or it may be that the wear or abrasion caused the treatment to wear off. The breathability (an equally big deal in the comfort category) of the fabric did not seam affected. In any case I had no garment leakage and I was very pleased with the performance and will be buying more in the future.June 15,2015. I did purchase the blue label variety and it does not work as well as the green label. I came back for a gallon this time and am refilling the spray bottle. This stuff is fantastic and I am now spraying raingear for my fishing friends. If you want waterproof rain gear this is the product to buy. My son sprayed some chair seats with this product but so far not spills so no feedback.",

                "reviewText": "Brief summary: This stuff WORKS to keep outdoor sectional cushions dry. In a comparison of 303 Fabric Guard and Rust-Oleum 278146 NeverWet 11-Ounce Outdoor Fabric Spray, Clear , both are great but 303 is the winner on application, cost efficiency, drying time, look and feel.OVERALL WINNER: 303EASE OF APPLICATION: 303- Rustoleum feels less greasy when wet than 303. The 303 bottle leaked more my hands.- 303's compact spray setting wasted less product than the mist setting on either product. Compact spray still gave an even coating like the mist, and wasted less product.- Both products made cushions appear damp when treated, so it was easy to see where the product was applied.- 303 left less troublesome bubbles than Rustoleum.SCENT: Rustoleum- Both scents are very strong. Apply outdoors.- Rustoleum is pleasantly scented rather than unmasked chemical smell.COST EFFICIENCY: 303- Both products covered less area than they promised. 303 was farther off from its promise than Rustoleum, but still came out cheaper per square foot of coverage.- Rustoleum promised 20-60 square feet of coverage fabric per 11oz at $15. Expected cost: $0.25 to $0.75/square foot.-303 promised 80-200 square feet of coverage per 32oz at $22. Expected cost: $0.11 to $0.27/square foot.- My cushions have a textured heavy fabric. I applied according to instructions, dampening but not saturating the fabric with the product. My 4-piece outdoor sectional with seat and back cushions had 67 square feet of cushion.- One 11oz, $15 bottle of Rustoleum gave 11 square feet of coverage. $1.36 per square foot.- Two 32oz, $22 bottles of 303 covered 56 square feet. $0.78 per square foot.DRYING TIME: 303- 303 required 6-12 hours before use depending on temperature and sunlight.- Rustoleum required 24 hours before exposure to water.- I left both products to dry overnight outside, 70-75 degrees, on a dry night.- Within 3 hours, the 303 cushions started to look dry. After 5 hours, the Rustoleum cushions still looked wet. In the morning both looked totally dry.LOOK AND FEEL WHEN DRY: 303- Neither product changed the color or appearance of the cushions, or caused a change in feel noteworthy enough to outweigh the waterproofing benefits.- Smell: 303\u2019s was gone within 12 hours, and Rustoleum's was gone after 24 hours.- Feel: Both products make the upholstery feel slightly thicker and stiffer.- Texture: Rustoleum has a very slightly rubbery, almost tacky feel while the 303 cushions do not.- Cleaning: Because of the tackiness of the Rustoleum cushions, dirt and pollon stick slightly more, but are easily wiped off with a damp paper towel.WATERPROOFING: Rustoleum, but barely- Both treatments almost completely waterproofed the cushions.- Dew: Morning dew beads up on both 303 and Rustoleum cushions. It can be brushed off completely from the Rustoleum cushions, and can be brushed off with very few droplets soaking in on the 303 cushions. Both are totally dry within an hour of sunlight exposure.- Rain: At the end 2 hours of rain during the day, there was pooling and beading of water on both cushions. After shaking and brushing off the water from the cushions, both were left mildly damp, and were dry and ready to use within 2 hours.- Spills: a full cup of water spilled on either cushion pools, beads, and runs off the sides. After using a paper towel to soak up what remained and brushing off droplets, the cushions were totally dry with no soaking-in through either product. An accidental watermelon spill on a 303 cushion cleaned easily by blotting with a dry paper towel the wiping with a wet paper towel. No word yet on red wine or other spills, but I will update if/when they happen.- Too soon to tell how well it will last.",
