This had a good rating so I figure I\u2019d give it a shot. I love this detergent! It doesn\u2019t have a strong smell and I don\u2019t smell it on my clothes after they have been washed. This refill lasted me 8 months!!!! We probably do 3-5 loads of laundry a week (for a family of 4), ~2 pumps per wash. I\u2019m just so impressed and my clothes are clean without the harsh chemicals. I was probably buying 1 big container of store-brand laundry detergent prior to this for about $10-15 a jug\u2026.so I\u2019ve saved a ton of money! Also, I love that I\u2019m creating less plastic waste. We bought the original pump bottle and use the refill bag to top-up the pump bottle. Thank you Puracy for creating a product that is clean, actually works, and is environmentally friendly! Cheers!",

                "reviewText": "The product itself works amazing. I am so happy with the purchase for that reason alone. It smells wonderful and my clothes have been really clean and I've cleaned some dirty stuff!! The reason I am giving only four stars instead of five is because of the packaging. When I received the bottle, some of the product had managed to leak. Not enough that it would warrant a call to the company for loss of product, but enough to make a mess. The bottle was wrapped in plastic bag and all on the inside of the plastic bag there was detergent and I had to wash the bottle off. When I went to check the cap, it was barely screwed on and the aluminum seal was wrinkled and not sealed (obviously). The other issue I'm having is that the pump itself is leaking. After several uses of the detergent, it tends to drip. I have to keep a paper towel under it. I wasn't expecting that and when I went in to grab another cleaner out of my cabinet after several uses of the detergent there was a puddle of product under the container and the other cleaner. I couldn't figure where it was coming from at first and I thought there might be a crack in the bottle from shipping. I pulled it out of my cabinet, and again cleaned the bottle. I left it on my counter in my laundry room with a paper towel under it and after a few days saw there is an ever increasing ring in the paper towel from underneath the pump. So, for now, this is where it will stay.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent product, good science, could be less wasteful",
                "reviewText": "This worked very well for us (old top loading washer). I didn't put it through any scientific tests or need to deal with serious stains. It's easy to use, just pump once or twice, and it's fragrance-free (I think they sell scented versions as well).I like how committed to science and reality Puracy is, particularly how they stood up to the EWG and their binary neurotic approach to ingredients as mundane as borax, which is completely safe as a <1% ingredient in a laundry detergent. As long as you don't add Puracy to your cereal every morning for the rest of your life, you're good (and probably even if you do...)Seeing actual surfactants in Puracy's ingredients won me over compared to Molly's Laundry Powder, which has none. Molly's only has washing soda, baking soda, Epsom salt, and table salt. I don't know what dark magic Molly's has unlocked there, and it seemed fine when I tried it, but I had no stains to test it on, and I just couldn't get around the lack of surfactants/detergents, the potential long-term accrual of grease/skin oil on clothes due to Molly's not removing it, and any future stain drama where real detergent is needed. I also like that Puracy has enzymes, including lipase, which is less common. (Though I'm confused by stuff Puracy has said about the enzymes needing 15+ minutes to kick in \u2013 do they get that amount of time in a typical washing machine's wash cycle, before the rinsing starts? Seems like it's over by then, or almost.)My only complaint is that the pump bottle design wastes some of the product, since it will leave some on the bottom, un-pumpable. I like to flip bottles near their end-of-life to get all the product out. It's not a huge thing, and I guess it's less of a problem if you buy refill jugs and keep refilling \u2013 I assume they sell refills.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using this detergent for years. My family had very sensitive skin and it doesn\u2019t irritate anyone. I like that is concentrated so it takes up much less on my counter as well as it last a lot longer. It\u2019s also really nice to use the pump on the bottle versus having to pour out of a container or have the kind with the leaky spout. Added bonus is that\u2019s better fot the environment as there\u2019s less plastic waste :)",
