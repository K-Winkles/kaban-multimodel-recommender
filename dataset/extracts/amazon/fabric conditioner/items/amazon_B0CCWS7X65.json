While it isn\u2019t magic it can\u2019t hurt to have some help keeping your clothes and linens a little less, wrinkly. BETTER FOR YOUR DRYER Chemical build-up on your dryer can\u2019t be good for it, right? Right. Wool dryer balls are chemical-free and also help reduce your drying time. Both wins for laundry day. BETTER FOR EVERYONE While this one seems obvious I thought I\u2019d get on my horse and talk about it anyway. We all know the benefits of less consumption, dryer sheets are an obvious waste-product that is easily eliminated with the use of wool dryer balls. But let\u2019s go beyond that. Fewer chemicals on your clothes keep them brighter, fresher, and absorbant longer. Meaning those sweaters, bed linens and towels you LOVE won\u2019t end up as \u2018hot messes\u2019 before you get the best out of them. When we purchase with intention we\u2019d like to see that through the whole process, wouldn\u2019t we? So, extend the life of your most favorite linens by using wool. BETTER FOR YOUR LINENS Let\u2019s start with absorbency. You love a soft towel that helps you get dry after a warm shower. Chemicals from dryer sheets build up on your towels and linens and overtime decreases their absorbency, which leads to the replacement of the towels, landfills, you get the bigger picture. By using wool dryer balls you eliminate the chemicals and will extend the life of your towels and other linens.",

                "reviewText": "I have always heard that people have used wool dryer balls in their dryers for wrinkle free and zero static clothes. They have also mentioned that it cuts down on drying time. I had to try it with these organic wool dryer balls and was shocked! My clothes came out with less wrinkles and dried in 1/4 of the time that it usually takes. What I discovered is that it also fluffs up the pillows and the blankets without the need to use tennis balls that can leave plastic parts on the items.I was worried that the balls would leave little white lints on the clothes and I was pleasantly surprised that I was wrong (it happens once in a while). What I also learned is that I can add essential oils to the wall balls and it will add a pleasant smell to the clothes without the need to use fabric softener sheets.",

                "reviewText": "Great wool dryer balls! I added all of them into my dryer and they work just as intended. They help my dryer dry clothes and big blankets faster and more evenly. I already hang up most of my clothes so I mainly utilize these with the harder-to-dry items. I think everyone should move towards having items that make daily chores better for themselves and the environment. 10/10 would recommend.",
