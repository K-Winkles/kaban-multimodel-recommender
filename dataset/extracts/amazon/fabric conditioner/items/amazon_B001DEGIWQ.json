With your first soak in Eucalan, you should likely see the water in the wash basin turn a bit brown. The soap releases dirt into the wash basin, & though the clothing absorbs a little of the soap, it is beneficial. Lanolin fortifies & conditions clothing fibres - particularly great for woolens & knits, but can be used on most anything. Scented with only pure essential oils, some of them contain long-term cleaning properties that are intended to remain in the clothing to further benefit from; Think swim suits & lingerie that lie close to the skin, or blankets & knitted sweaters that get packed away for the cold months. Eucalan\u2019s no-rinse formula is also convenient \u2013 great for travel when you\u2019re not likely to have a washing machine, or are seeking to conserve water. If you still feel the urge to rinse, it is safe to do so. The soap has done its job of cleaning, though you will lose the lasting effects of the lanolin & essential oils.",

I\u2019m very sensitive to chemicals, so its extremely important that anything I use chemical free and unscented. This is perfect. It\u2019s great for wool, but is also great on cotton, as the lanolin softens the cotton. The only downside is it\u2019s a little on the expensive side, but you if you actually use the amount they suggest it does go a long way. I just seem to have trouble doing that!",

It doesn't require excessive agitation to cleanse the fabric, and rinsing the fabrics in fresh water is not necessary when you're ready to hang dry them (in fact, the instructions specifically say NOT to rinse the fabrics), so laundering with this formula is about as easy as handwashing gets. Definitely going to purchase again when my current bottle runs out.",

SDH. Wonderful sheets ... and guessing from the price of them here at Amazon I now understand why. OMG, $150 for one standard pillow case!Anyway, on the page with the sheets there was this Eucalan wash ... so I looked at it. Compared to the LeBlanc, it was a little less expensive ... and as I read the reviews I really got excited. You can use this in the washer, but you don't rinse it ... you go right to spin after you've let it soak for 1/2 hr or more. I ordered it and washed the expensive SDH sheets in it ... and they came out looking great and feeling wonderful.Decided to do all my laundry in it. Just spent the last weekend doing my clothing. OMG, does it make your clothing feel great! And the bonus for me, I just started full-timing in a RV morothome with my own laundry ... this means I use less water and don't have to full hookups when doing the laundry (so long as I don't go overboard ;-) )",

                "reviewText": "I've always been a fan of the Kokaburra lanolin wash that I used to buy at our local food co-op. After we moved to a different state I wasn't able to find it so I decided to buy this one based on the great reviews (it was cheaper online than the Kokaburra). I used it to wash a sheepskin that had gotten very dirty and dusty during our move. And it now looks so white and beautiful and soft! I'm very impressed! A little bit of product is enough. It lathers very well. The smell is almost non existent, which I'm happy about. I can't wait to use it to wash all my knitted sweaters & scarves this Winter.",

I feel like my sweater stretched a bit doesn't feel as bulky as it did when I first got it. I am a traveler living in an Airstream so something easy to use is key. I have to say, it was easy to wash, drying time was 2-3 days of air drying. Would try the scented next time. I would highly recommend this wash.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this originally for washing wool diaper covers but I have started using this on blankets because it makes them SO SOFT. I had the unfortunate experience of not reading the instructions on how to dry a very plush microfiber blanket and it came out of the dryer a little rough. Knowing what this does with wool, I tried it on the blanket and it was almost back to its normal fluffiness... gave it a second wash with a soak and fwala, super plush blanket is super soft again, just like new.Lanolin is amazing and this laundry soap is a game changer when it comes to having very soft fabric.The only negative thing I could even say is that it's incredibly unfortunate that lanolin is a common contact allergen, so if you have Eczema, you may want to avoid this one.",

At first, they looked sad, but once they dried after a couple days, I brushed them out with my dog's clean wire brush... and they look just as good as new! I also washed an alpaca skin rug that I got in Ecuador a decade ago. It was filthy and matted. I washed it in the tub and gently squeezed out the suds (didn't rinse). It hung to dry for several days, and looked very sad, to the point where I thought I'd ruined it. But then once I brushed it out and put some leather conditioner on the back, it was gorgeous once again! Also, I love that there is an unscented version! Highly, highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I rarely write reviews but I had to write this one. I've recently started buying cashmere and merino wool sweaters at consignment shops. Not entirely trusting that the sweaters had been cleaned I decided to clean them before adding them to my wardrobe. But dry cleaning more than a dozen sweaters is prohibitively expensive.I used to use the famous W-------- to clean my sweaters and other delucates. Nothing wrong with that product but it uses a tremendous amount of water to wash one sweater (soak, rinse at least once, fabric softener, if used) and I live in a state where water is in short supply. Somewhere I stumbled across a mention of this product and decided to try it.I've now washed a dozen or so sweaters and love this product. One short soak and you are done. I purchase the unscented version and it is unscented. It is pricy but a little goes a long way.Color may bleed when you wash things so, if you wash multiple items at a time, make sure they are similar shades! I wash my sweaters individually but noticed some discoloration in the water as I emptied the basin.",

                "reviewText": "Das Waschmittel ist als unparf\u00fcmierte Variante erh\u00e4ltlich, man muss die W\u00e4sche nicht sp\u00fclen und es beinhaltet Lanolin (r\u00fcckfettend f\u00fcr Wolle). Diese Kombination macht das Eucalan gegenw\u00e4rtig im Jahr 2022 zu meinem Lieblings Waschmittel f\u00fcr Wolle. Aber auch f\u00fcr andere Stoffe.Und einzigartig auf dem Weltmarkt (unparf\u00fcmiert, Lanolin, kein Sp\u00fclen n\u00f6tig).Chlormethylisothiazolinon wird hier in einer Rezension negativ bewertet.Ich habe Eucalan direkt angeschrieben und mir wurde von Lisa Ward mitgeteilt, dass in den vergangenen 30 Jahren, so lange gibt es das Eucalan Waschmittel schon, es keine Vorf\u00e4lle durch Chlormethylisothiazolinon gab.Zitat der Antwort von Lisa Ward:For over 30 years we have not heard of any issues with Methylchloroisothiazolinone. I feel it just depends on the individual themselves. We do have customers that prefer to rinse Eucalan and that is okay. We suggest that as you are rinsing it that you add just a little Eucalan to the rinse water to help continue the fibres with the lanolin.Auf der Homepage von Eucalan gibt es vielf\u00e4ltige Anwendungsbeispiele f\u00fcr Eucalan, nicht nur f\u00fcr Wolle.(Fleckenbehandlung f\u00fcr Sofa, Haustiere werden damit gewaschen, Sportkleidung -> allerdings w\u00fcrde ich bei Sportkleidung auf das Sp\u00fclen nicht verzichten)Ich habe damit meine Levis Jeans mit Flecken gewaschen. Die Flecken waren schon lange auf der Hose, ich wasche meine Jeans ganz selten.Die Flecken habe ich vor dem Waschen mit Wasser benetzt, das Eucalan unverd\u00fcnnt einmassiert und nach 10 Minuten in eine Schale mit Wasser und Eucalan gelegt. Die Hose wurde hin und wieder innerhalb der zwei Stunden, wo sie sich in der Schale befand gewendet und bewegt. Danach zum Trocknen \u00fcber Nacht nach drau\u00dfen auf die W\u00e4scheleine geh\u00e4ngt. Und war schlie\u00dflich sauber geworden.Bei Anwendung f\u00fcr Wolle habe ich mit Eucalan beste Ergebnisse erzielt, im Vergleich zu anderen Waschmitteln f\u00fcr Wolle. Das Lanolin macht die Wolle weicher als Wollwaschmittel ohne Lanolin.Die M\u00f6glichkeit nicht Sp\u00fclen zu m\u00fcssen ist gerade in der heutigen Zeit, wo bedacht auf die Umwelt geachtet wird fantastisch!Ich kann allerdings hier auf Amazon seit 2019 das unparf\u00fcmierte Eucalan nicht kaufen ... Es ist immer ausverkauft. Ich kaufe es \u00fcber einen Onlineshop.Nachtrag13. Oktober 2023:Habe auf der Eucalan Seite bei FAQ folgende Information zu Methylchloroisothiazolinone gefunden:Methylchloroisothiazolinone (CMIT) is a widely used preservative and antibacterial found in liquid cosmetics, household cleaners, and personal care products.The use of Methylchloroisothiazolinone (Chlormethylisothiazolinon) is regulated in most countries to ensure safe concentrations.As most preservatives are, Methylchloroisothiazolinone can cause skin irritation in high concentrations. However, Eucalan uses the minuscule amount of <10 parts per million (ppm).Methylchloroisothiazolinone is not listed by The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a known, probable, or possible human carcinogen.Das hei\u00dft, dass das Chlormethylisothiazolinon der Inhaltsstoff in Eucalan, der hier in einer Rezension negativ bewertet wird in der angewendeten Konzentration harmlos ist.Ich habe so ziemlich alle bekannten Wollwaschmittel in den vergangenen vier Jahren ausprobiert.Ich kann f\u00fcr meine Zwecke sagen, dass Eucalan die Nummer Eins ist.Der Vorteil nicht sp\u00fclen zu m\u00fcssen ist unschlagbar und die Wollkleidung durch den Lanolin Anteil f\u00fchlbar weich. Der Weichheitseffekt h\u00e4lt etwa f\u00fcnf Tage an, bei Wollkleidung, die als erste Kleidungsschicht getragen wird. Aber nach f\u00fcnf Tagen ist auch das Kleidungsst\u00fcck, welches als erste Kleidungsschicht getragen wird, reif f\u00fcr eine neue W\u00e4sche.",
