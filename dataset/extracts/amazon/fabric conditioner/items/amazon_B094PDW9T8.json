Hopefully this is just a bad batch I received.I\u2019m so glad I enjoy this scent and take a deep satisfying whiff of this product Each and every time I put this in a load of laundry.I immediately noticed it was off. The smell gave me a headache. It Smells like chemicals and has a yellow tint and seems more moist than usual.See picture of comparison.(Left- bad smelling new order)(Right- good smelling previous order)",
