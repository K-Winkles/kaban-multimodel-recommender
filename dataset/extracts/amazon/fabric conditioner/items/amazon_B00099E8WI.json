                "reviewText": "For the price, they may not be the big bottles but as I was saying for the price it is well worth it. I have always used downy but after I hit my early 20s I'm 31 now for some reason any scented fabric softener or detergent would make me itch so bad and make my skin feel raw and benadrayl would not help nor taking a shower thinking if I took the clothes that had the scent it would stop it didn't, it got so bad it had me in tears and that's when my Dr. Told me I was allergic to whatever dyes and scents used in detergents and softeners that had a scent and dyed.For years I stopped using fabric softener, and just used dryer sheets on clothes I needed I could throw in the dryer but again they had the same but the reaction was not as severe.When Downy came out with Downy free and Gentle for sensitive skin I was so happy because I always liked downy, and I found it works great in keeping your clothes, blankets, or animal beds very soft (which my dog loves lol).But yes they are the smaller bottles but you get six, and a little goes a long way. Especially if you follow the directions on amount to use on the bottle. The cap has fill lines so you know. So it really last you sometime. It's also great cause my nephew has eczema he is super sensitive to dyes and perfumes and it does not irritate his skin either. I have tried other softners in the past but downy has always been at least I found to be the best brand. It works super well, it does get your things very soft, and keeping your colors a bit more vibrant or blacks from fading so fast. A added bonus of that it is dye and perfume or scented free.",

                "reviewText": "The product is as Downy always is for those of us with allergies especially to cleaning materials. The best of the major manufactures. Excellent product. My experience and my skin has been do not waste your money on something you never heard of other than online comments that may or may not be sound. My only advice for purchase would be sure to compare price per oz in quantity purchases. It will surprise you (at least it did me). One item will be listed as cost per load. The next will be price per oz. Well that is like comparing apples to oranges. Throw out your normal assumptions that the larger the container the less the cost. Take a second and do a simple math equation once you decide your product and find out the comparative cost per oz. Frankly it surprised the heck out of me.",
