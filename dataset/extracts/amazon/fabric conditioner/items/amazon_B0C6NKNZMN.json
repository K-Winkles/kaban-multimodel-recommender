It\u2019s a slow process but im working on it.The amount of unnecessary plastic packaging (non recyclable type in my area) was astounding. I couldn\u2019t think of any reason to have used that much plastic on an eco friendly product when the same could have been accomplished with cardboard.So, the wool balls work great, the packaging is my only complaint.",

                "reviewText": "I really have no major complaints about these. I have used multiple brands of dryer balls varying in prices, and these are on par in terms of quality to more expensive brands that I have used. The packaging is pretty and ensures that the dryer balls maintain their shape during shipment. I have had some shedding during the first couple of uses with other brands, but this is not an issue that I have had with these at all. I anticipate that they will last a long time, and I am happy with theseThe inclusion of oils is nice, even though I prefer not to add those. Another reviewer has gone in-depth regarding the use of these oils, and I highly recommend giving their review a read if you plan to use them for anything outside of on the dryer balls themselves (as it appears that important safety information has been excluded regarding using the oils on your skin or oral use. It is my understanding that essential oils should never be ingested, so I wouldn't recommend using them in any way that could result in you potentially swallowing the oils, such as in the oral rinse mentioned. Essential oil safety is important and, like that reviewer, I would recommend reading up on essential oil safety if you intend to use these for any purpose other than with the dryer balls. I also second their mention that essential oils should never be used directly on the skin without proper dilution. I encourage you to do your own research, though, as I am not an expert on this).",

The dryer balls are made of soft felt in a natural off-white color, are slightly larger than a tennis ball, and have no odor as received. They work to reduce drying time and soften clothes without fabric softeners. The essential oils can be used to scent the balls and therefore scent the clothes in a dryer load. The essential oils are 0.34 oz (10 mL) each; lavender source in France and peppermint source in USA. This is a high quality bundle that reduces the need for commercial fabric softeners that often contain artificial scents and chemicals. You can use the natural essential oils in tailored amounts of your choosing or just omit the oils for unscented drying. The oils can also be used separately for a multitude of essential oil uses, so the bundle is a good value. This set would make a good gift.",

                "reviewText": "True to description, nicely packaged. I've wanted to try these for years to replace fabric softener and they really do work! My issue was static electricity than needing additional fragrance (I like the smell of my \"manly\" laundry detergent, lol). They worked great alone and did seem to dry the clothes a little faster. I especially like the sustainability aspect as well as not having to clean the fabric softener residue out of the washer and dryer anymore- it leaves a waxy coating- liquid in the washer compartment that builds up and the sheets leave it on the sensor and lint screen.Both of the included essential oils smelled as stated. Tried the lavender on a load of towels and it did impart a slight fragrance that remained after drying but smelled heavy coming out of the dryer exhaust outside. Tip: rub the oil drops in. If its just sitting on top, the oil will transfer as oil blotches to the laundry.",
