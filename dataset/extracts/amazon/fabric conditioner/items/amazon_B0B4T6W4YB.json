So, naturally, being a massive fan of anything that smells good, I jumped on Amazon and perused all the different brands and scents and prices available. These were the ones I decided on (Clorox linen) and they DO smell nice but the scent just doesn't linger long enough for what I would prefer. Price was definitely good compared to many other brands, the amount I received in the 2 pack was even better, but I will try another brand next time. Just smelling from the bottle, heavenly. I did catch a whiff after washing on a sweater I didn't dry at all, but once everything else went into the dryer, there was barely any scent left unfortunately.",

My hope was our sheets and towels would have that luscious smell-good to them, but they don\u2019t. It\u2019s very faint if at all.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these as a less expensive alternative to the Downy unstoppables. 2 came in the pack and these are a finer granular texture versus a larger bead. I do feel you get more product for the money. Fragrance was good, not amazing like the unstoppables, but to be honest you use less and you still have fresher fragranced clothes. I got the linen fragrance because I was hesitating to go with TOO much scent.",
