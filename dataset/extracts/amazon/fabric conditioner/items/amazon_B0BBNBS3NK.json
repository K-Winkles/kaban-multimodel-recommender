                "reviewText": "I was nervous ordering this because of all the reviews saying it came in all beat up and the lids broken. But thankfully it came in perfect condition! They also put a long piece of sturdy tape over the lid to protect it during shipping so that gave me peace of mind seeing that! I haven't used it yet although I'm sure it works great on stains. It does smell amazing! Edit: Had to come back and say that washing my laundry now makes my whole house smell amazing!! Not only that but this stuff is no joke on stains! I got pizza oil/grease all over my new hoodie. It removed it! I had a towel that was stained for over a year. Now it's gone! This stuff really blows my mind!",

This not only leaves a good clean smell on the clothing but it actually cleans them too!! My boyfriend works with concrete everyday, it gets his clothes clean, where as gain didn't really clean them. I recommend it. Along with the clean burst dryer sheets!! delivery was within a week, even tho I pay for prime free 2 day shipping, I never get anything in less than a week. Ever. I figured they would just sent the jug of detergent, but they put it in a Amazon box. Lol I felt that was honestly a waste of a box and the bubble wrap. But never the less, packaging was great! Useless and wasteful... but great.. Lol (also,no leaks!)",

                "reviewText": "This is the best laundry detergent that I have used thus far!! I have gone through several different brands. It\u2019s gets the clothes very clean, and the smell is amazing. With last detergents, I always found myself using a lot of detergent bc the clothes would still be coming out with stains and odor. Then I started issuing multiple things in my laundry just to make it smell better. The scent booster beads, fabrics softener, etc. With Arm&Hammer I don\u2019t have to use any of that. Just the detergent and a small amount of at that and the clothes come out exceptionally clean every time.",

                "reviewText": "After 45+ years of faithfully using what I thought was the best laundry detergent (Tide) I have switched to this one. It really works that well, and it costs less. I bought it the first time on a whim because of the lower price on Amazon, satisfaction with other Arm & Hammer products and plain old curiosity. So glad I did that! I've been using this Arm & Hammer detergent for 4 months now, and it has consistently eliminated stains and odors even from my teenage grand son's dirty socks. I quickly recommended it to my daughter and daughter-in-law, and they love it too.",
