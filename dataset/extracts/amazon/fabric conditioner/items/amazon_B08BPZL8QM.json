                "reviewText": "Of all my daily chores, ironing is the one I dislike doing the most. So much so that I have most of my shirts either non-ironed or wrinkle-free. I also avoid ironing my bed sheets. I used to avoid ironing so much, but there are some things I still have to do. I use wrinkle-free fabric softener when washing and put them in a laundry net bag, but even that wasn't enough. When I found this product, I was skeptical. I actually tried it and was amazed. My husband prefers linen shirts. That bothers me because linen shirts always get wrinkled. I sprayed it on and the wrinkles were gone. It is different from ironing, can you imagine? It has the unique softness of linen, not pressed with an iron. It was very wet right after spraying, but it dried quickly. I also sprayed another cotton shirt. It even kept the sleeves smooth and wrinkle-free. I feel that this is a lifesaver for ironing-averse folks like myself. I have decided to subscribe.",

                "reviewText": "I first bought this 2-pack in December 2020 (for $14) and though I found that it did not help with my laundering needs, it did smell nice! It arrived on time and in new condition but I found that even fully stretched-out 100% cotton T-shirts would barely unfurl with heavy spraying. I soon found a better use for it--an air freshener for when a certain someone in the house would use the toilet and/or shower without deodorizing the bathroom. Eventually I switched to (Moso Natural) charcoal bags due to their price, longevity and eco-friendliness and opened the windows even in freezing temperatures. Nonetheless the \u201codor eliminator\u201d aspect is still fairly accurate and these bottles were sold at a great price! For all this I give the \u201cDowny Wrinkle Release Spray Plus, Static Remover, Odor Eliminator, Steamer for Clothes Accessory, Fabric Refresher and Ironing Aid, Light Fresh Scent, 33.8 Fluid Ounce (Pack of 2)\u201d a serviceable 3/5 stars!",
