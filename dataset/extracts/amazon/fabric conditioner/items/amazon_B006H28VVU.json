                "reviewText": "I really like this product but it is hard to find at my local store, even at the \"natural\" stores. There are some eczema issues in my family and we have to use all fragrance free products with gentle ingredients and this is on of the softeners that meets that qualification. No eczema issues are triggered when we use this softener and towels come out nice and fluffy. I do double rinse all our clothes though.The only downside is that the price here on Amazon is twice what I could find someplace else. I usually can find it around $6 per bottle, but here two bottles are twice as much. However, since it is difficult to find, this is one of the few places where I can order it and be conveniently delivered to my house. But if I find it someplace else at a more reasonable price I stock up. :-)",
