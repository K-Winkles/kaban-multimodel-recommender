Leaves you clothes smelling outstanding for a while. I like to also throw the used ones in hidden spaces or trash cans to keep the smell going around my place. Definitely recommend",

                "reviewText": "Nice alternative to Lenor dryer sheets if you fancy a change. A little dearer, but still only work out at 10p per sheet, so hardly breaking the bank. These have a decently strong fragrance, kind of soapy/woody, which I could see being popular with men in particular. They do soften well (the effect is particularly good on jeans I find), and prevent static cling on synthetic fabrics. It's a good size box as well, which should last me the year.Like any other dryer sheet, these won't work particularly well in a heat pump tumble dryer, due to the lower temperatures involved. Fine in a regular vented or condenser dryer, however.",

                "reviewText": "Like some of the previews; the smell is very INTENSE. When I received my package and finally opened it; the smell was very strong! My entire family room and kitchen smelled like Dryer Sheets. The smell will subside, BELIEVE ME; you just probably would need to air it out, which might seem odd.On a price point; these are definitely cheaper than purchasing these from a Big Box Store. Just as a comparison; a Twin Pack of Bounce Dryer Sheets sells for $25.00 at Costco! They have almost the same amount of Dryer Sheets; however if you do the math; you could technically buy 3 of these and pay more than $25.00 however getting an extra box as well as another 240 Sheets! So definitely a great buyThese Dryer Sheets are fantastic and my clothes smell amazing and again no intense lingering smell. I didn't find these to agitate my skin afterwards, and I have relatively sensitive skin as well as some my family members. No issues no complaints or awkward scratching! \ud83e\udd23Good buy for both the quantity and savings in the end! Make sure to pick up a box or few!If you found my Review helpful, please make sure to click the Helpful Link button on your way out. Happy Shopping.",
