                "reviewText": "This is the 2nd bottle I have ordered on Amazon. The first came quickly, packaged well, and undamaged. This package was delivered intact, not a dent in the box. Inside this bottle of OxiClean was inside a sealed plastic bag, the cap was taped, and there was a half cap of purple liquid OxiClean floating around inside the plastic bag. It was all fully encased, nothing leaked outside of that plastic bag. I put it inside the washing machine, cut the top of the bag, removed the bottle, turned the bag inside out and used it for the load of laundry. So I did not lose any. I do not know what the supplier could have done differently to prevent the leakage as it all appeared to have been packaged well. So, no complaints, accidents happen. I will order the product again as it works, I will just hope it does not leak!",

Fabulous!I couldn't wait to try this in my portable washing machine. Towels, socks, rags and such just never seemed to smell clean. I noticed after the first load that everything smells fantastic!This is an ADDITIVE to be used together with your usual laundry soap, just in case you've not completely read through the description.Amazing scent! Amazing product!",

Yesterday I was reading some reviews up here and I got a little scared because some people said that the product stinks. No it doesn't! It smells wonderful! I just ordered two more bottles. It's just my son and myself and it's very rare that our dirty clothes stink. I originally purchased this product because I need a laundry booster mainly for my sons shirts that are blue red and white to keep the white bright. But I also love my laundered clothes to smell fresh. This will do both. I'm going to continue to add this product to my laundering process.",
