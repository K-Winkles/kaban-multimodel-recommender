                "reviewText": "I would like to begin by establishing the fact that I am not a professional photographer. I would also like to establish the fact that, this is my first time owning a professional tripod. I am however, an amateur photographer who enjoys photography as a hobby. I couldn't afford a full size DSLR with expensive lenses, so I have a Canon SX 620HS pocket camera. But don't let that fool you, Canon's new pocket camera's in the SX class come with a lot of features found in a DSLR's, and if you know what you are doing, you can take pictures that would make someone swear, that you took them with a DSLR.I notice that a lot of people choose tripods based on weight capacity. Do enough reading, and you start to pickup on this fact that people make weight, as the deciding factor. I've used those cheapo 20 dollar tripods you can buy just about anywhere, and I can tell you right now, they might be able to hold a camera that weighs no more then 2 pounds, but they are absolute crap in just about every way. Sure the cheapo tripods are quick to setup, but if the wind knocks them over cause they are lighter then my hand, then what good are they? Plus they don't have fluid heads, so you can forget about making smoothing pans with them too.I don't care how ridiculous it looks having a small camera, on such a huge tripod, I don't care what other's think. What matters is, this is an awesome tripod that works great. The bag is about as long as the tripod fully collapsed. (35-inches) Its truly a nice bag, made of quality materials, comes with a carry strap, and everything you need to get setup. Apparently, some people thought the tripod pan handle was missing, its not missing, its detachable, and is located in a micro zippered pocket, within the bag itself, which also includes the manual and some wrench keys.This tripod weighs at least 10-pounds, and you will notice it right away, when you get it out of the bag. Unfolding it is similar to a cheapo tripod, just takes a few seconds longer, cause of the heft of this thing. Now, unlike a cheapo tripod that uses those locking latches to lock/unlock the legs, the Coman uses wing nut tighteners. Because of this design, it takes a little longer to set the tripod up, but its a very secure system. To get to the 2nd level of extension, you do the same thing, unscrew the top knobs on the legs, and then tighten them when your done.Fully extended, this puppy gets to 74-inches tall, which is taller then most humans! This means that if you were taking pics or video within a crowd of people, you can easily get a clear shot, because your camera is above everybodies heads lol. The pan handle uses a multiple position teeth locking system with threaded bolt. This means you can position the handle exactly how you want it before tightening it down. Additionally, this allows you to orient it the length of the tripod when fully collapsed, that way you don't have to remove the handle for storing the tripod in the bag.This tripod has a ton of adjustments! You can lock/unlock the pan and or the tilt. You can adjust the tripod level using the center bottom knob, and using the bubble level at the base of the tripod. You can lock/unlock the mounting plate, as well as adjust mounting plate position. There is even an 3/8 accessory port to attach a professional tripod accessory. And then there is the wonderful fluid head! Oh my gosh, I've never used a tripod that was so smooth in the panning and tilting before! This is exactly what you want if your a professional photographer.The mounting plate is removable, so it makes it easy to thread the 1/4 -20 bolt, into many small camera's. So there you have it folks, if your an amateur, or a professional, this is a tripod that anybody can use. And with this price tag, this is something many can afford. If there are anybody like me out there who are looking for a better quality tripod to use with their cheap camera, at least now you know this Coman KX3636 tripod is an option for you. Its super sturdy on its legs and won't easily fall over, even in some wind!Highly recommended 5 out of 5 stars!",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a solid tripod for my DSLR and other cameras. The cheap ones are not very steady, make it difficult to move the camera ONLY A SMALL BIT, and are a pain to level. My old tripod had little spikes coming out the bottom which is great on concrete, but will scratch nice flooring.I'm currently using the tripod to do interior photography. A single extension puts the camera at the perfect height. I found the level and leveling ball very nice when I'm stuck putting one leg on a carpet and the others on the floor. The fluid head is easy to adjust and I'm found I can use the DSLR just fine without attaching the adjustment arm. And my DSLR is pretty heavy. It has some heavy glass on it as well as a strobe and reflector on top. I'm doing multiple HDR-like exposures so NO CAMERA MOVEMENT between shots is really important. An added plus is that the included carrying bag is really nice.But this is not a tripod you'll want to take backpacking. It's built with light-weight materials, but there is a lot to this tripod. I envision that someone using this will also have a significant amount of camera equipment they're hauling along with them. I was a bit surprised by how long it is when collapsed. Somehow reading the specs and holding the item are two very different things. But I did want a tripod that where I could put the camera at head height and still have a nice, stable platform. Also the extension locks are real easy and fast to use. You could use this tripod for a small telescope!On the negative side, an allen wrench is needed to attach and remove a camera from the easily-removable platform. I expect the designers intended each camera to have one of these platforms permanently attached, but that's not how I expect to use it.Another reason I chose this tripod, is that Coman seems to seriously be in the tripod business. I like buying from a company that has a tight focus on the product I'm purchasing.",

                "reviewText": "I know my headline looks like I could be the company owner's nephew, but I'm not.I'm a free-lance video producer outside New York City, and I needed a very tall tripod that was durable, had a good fluid head and could handle some pretty rough settings - construction sites, outdoors at container shipping terminals, you name it.For $149, this tripod is an outstanding value. There are other \"name\" brands that are in the thousands, and maybe for some folks it's worth the larger investment. In my case, this tripod totally satisfied my requirements at a fraction of the cost. The fluid head is smooth as silk, completely adjustable with bubble level, and the legs extend as advertised - over six feet. Without a rotating viewfinder, I'd have to stand on an apple box to get as high as the camera - prefect for shooting over standing crowds, interviewing very tall subjects, etc.The quick-mount plate is professional grade, not like the cheap things you might find on other tripods in this price range. The carrying case is custom-sized, with a zipper pocket for the plate and other accessories.But what I was most impressed with was Coman's customer support. I had an issue with the ball head, and emailed Coman in Hong Kong. Their team immediately took a genuine interest in my concern, and not only worked to address it, but they stood by their product and EXCHANGED the head for a new one. It arrived in two days, pre-paid via DHL from their facility in Hong Kong. Their interest, follow up and support were as good as it gets!That's what every Amazon member hopes for - a great product at a good value, and a manufacturer/seller who will be there for you if you have an issue. Thank You, Coman!",
