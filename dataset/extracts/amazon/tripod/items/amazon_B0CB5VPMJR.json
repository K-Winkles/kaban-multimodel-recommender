                "reviewText": "This SmallRig tripod is great ! I do multiple camera video shoots and recently purchased an additional camera that I needed a tripod for. Did a lot of searching of many manufacturers and decided on the Small rig. It's well built and very light weight and sturdy. Leg extension is smooth and easy to extend and retract. The lever action latches on the legs are easy to operate and provide a positive grip. The storage zipper case also well made with room for the pan head . I own two other brand tripods I have had for a few years now Seeing how nice this one is I'm considering selling them and replacing with 2 more of these these Small Rig tripods. If you are in the market for a great tripod, I would recommend this SmallRig AD-80 FreeBlaze tripod.Very impressive....",

Ideally it would be nice to have a view free of any shaking but such a setup would not likely be portable. This tripod, despite being made in China, is well built with high friction adjustments allowing for much flexibility in setting it up. When I upgraded my binoculars, I needed a tripod that could handle the extra weight along with 14 pounds of counter weights. This would never have worked with my older \"heavy duty\" camera tripod.",

                "reviewText": "The tripod is great and was a big value for the price at $159. However, I had a bad experience with the shipping. I ordered it on a Thursday because it stated I would receive it by Saturday (in time for a photoshoot on Monday). On Saturday when it did not arrive I checked the status and it now said it would not arrive until the following Saturday. I checked the product listing to make sure I didnt misread it when I placed my order and noticed 2 alarming things:1. The price was not $2502. If I ordered it again it would deliver by Tuesday.So in summary: I ordered on Thursday for $150 and it would take 9 days to deliver, but if I was willing to order it again for $250 it would deliver in 3 days.It smells to me like someone made a mistake in the pricing and changed my delivery time in the hopes I would cancel my order because based on the quality of the tripod I can tell you that it is worth the $250.In conclusion, the tripod is a steal at $150 and a good deal at $250. But keep a close eye on the shipping time.",

However, my experience with it has been nothing short of disappointing. The materials used in its construction are of cheap quality, and it became evident from day one.Unlike my previous tripod (a Manfrotto), which served me well for nearly a decade without any issues, this one began falling apart almost immediately. The build quality is subpar, and after just a month of use, the tripod is now completely non-functional, as clearly demonstrated in the attached video.What frustrates me even more is the complete absence of customer service. When I tried to reach out for assistance, I encountered roadblocks and found no resolution to the issues I faced with the product.In conclusion, I would strongly advise against purchasing this tripod. It may seem like a budget-friendly option, but the long-term durability and customer service are sorely lacking.",
