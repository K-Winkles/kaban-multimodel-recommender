I wanted one that would hold my phone right in front of my face (I'm 5'3\"). I've traveled a bunch with this tripod and it's never been an issue (I was worried about the shape of it at first). It's really easy to setup and move, and versatile for many different locations. The part that holds the phone can move around into a many different positions. Overall, it's perfect for my needs :)The remote is a nice addition, but I don't personally use it. The only thing I don't love is that it's not always stable when it's open most of the way, and can sometimes wobble. This hasn't been a big enough issue for me to seek out other tripods though.",
