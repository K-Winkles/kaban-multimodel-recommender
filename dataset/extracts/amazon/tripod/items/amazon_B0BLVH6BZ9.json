Also, if you need to take stills in-between making a video or make a phone call you can just pull your phone off. Magsafe / magnets are amazing for this purpose.Super easy to mount to any tripod because the base is the standard 1/4-20 female threads.CONS: while it can be mounted on a selfie stick and will stay in place unless you make a rapid movement or if you hit branches, or strong wind outside of a car while driving, etc.",

                "reviewText": "I'm surprised by the terrible market for what should be an extremely cheap and easy to make product. i think a decent one should cost about $5, but this is about double the cost. but I'll leave that aside for this review since it's still among the cheapest options.the big problem is that the magnet is too weak. it holds ok if nothing bumps it, but as soon as there's a small jostle my phone falls off. I'm disappointed. this is one product where you want to err on the too strong side, not too weak.i also don't like the ball rotation. you'd think it sounds helpful. but if you rotate it too much and then zoom all the way out, the stand itself gets into the picture! modern day equivalent of a thumb in the picture \ud83e\udd23. i didn't even rotate it much, just a little off center.",

It only works on the top shaft section of all 5 sections. It does not appear to have been designed for the size of tubes the light uses - because even on the smallest diameter tube it's hard to get the connector to fasten as it's really dimensioned for 1/4\" to 3/8\" max. The smallest diameter shaft is >1/2\". If they'd used the same rubber size they used on the light stand itself it would work but it's clumsy to use the way it came. However it's usable enough not to be worth sending back. Clearly not a product designed by someone that cares about important details - but one that will ALWAYS remind me that it was kludged together by someone rather careless about customer satisfaction.",
