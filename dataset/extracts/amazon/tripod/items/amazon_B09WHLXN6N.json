I've been looking for a replacement for months, and when I opened this up it was the perfect size and the build quality is great... I have no concerns about the phone mount as it can easily fit larger phones than my Samsung S22 Ultra. Would buy again, got priority shipping and it arrived so quickly... Very happy with my purchase.",
