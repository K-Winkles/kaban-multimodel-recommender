It\u2019s sturdy. Great the size is perfect. it rotates well I trust it with my phone.",

                "reviewText": "Today what I have for everyone is my full written review of the USTINE Selfie Stick Tripod, with Bluetooth Remote. What I've decided to do for this review is break it down into the positives and negatives of the selfie stick tripod with integrated remote and then we're going to talk about the overall pricing and availability and I'm going to give everyone my final thoughts and a recommendation. That being said let's begin.Positives-the selfie stick with integrated tripod is Really versatile and portable with its 30 to 90\u00b0 tilting head and 360\u00b0 rotatable smartphone mount also it has the ability to fit any size smartphone from 3.5 in up to about 6.5 it will also work on your device with or without a case. And you can also change out the smartphone mount for a regular 1/4 thread so you can mount things like GoPros or any other mountable camera so the versatility and portability of the selfie stick / tripod is top notch. The overall build quality is top notch as well everything fits nice and neatly in place and the smartphone clamps click into place and lock firmly it feels extremely solid so that is really good as well. Another positive would be the overall balance of the selfie stick / tripod it's extremely balanced even while having devices that are a little bit heavy and it doesn't get top or back heavy making it lean it stays very firm and nice in place.and the last positive would probably be the price that it's available for but we're going to talk about the pricing a little bit later on period okay that about does it for the positives now let's move on.Negatives-in terms of the negatives of the selfie stick / tripod they're really only two that I came across one being the tilt head does not tilt far enough in my opinion it's usable but I would like it to be able to tilt and pan a little further they advertise 225\u00b0 but in terms of actual usage it only pans and tilts about 30 to 90\u00b0. So that definitely needs some improvement in my opinion and the last negative would have to be the balance although it's a lot better balance than some of the other selfie sticks / tripods that I've taken to look at the balance still does need a little bit of work if you do put a device on it that's too heavy for it it does have a tendency to droop and once the selfie stick lowers past a certain point the tripod legs don't hold it up so they really need to figure out the balance and maybe incorporate a locking mechanism to lock the selfie stick and tripod into the open position. All right that about does it for the positives and the negatives in my opinion the positives of this selfie stick/tripod greatly outweigh the negatives. That being said let's move on.Price & Final Thoughts-okay so in terms of pricing I actually picked this bad boy up via Amazon and it's available in prices ranging from $6 to $10 and at that price you're probably wondering can I recommend that you pick this up? Well I would have to say yes as long as you can deal with the two negatives that I pointed out in this review I feel like this is definitely worth picking up so once again can I recommend that everyone go out there and pick this up I would have to say yes. Especially if you're in the market for a product like this one I think it should serve you well. Okay that pretty much does it for this review I hope everyone found it helpful and I hope you have a good day evening and or night depending on the time and your location you are when you read this review.",

                "reviewText": "The price on this is great, especially for someone starting out taking selfies. Oh, how I don't like having my picture taken! But I have found it's very useful for product photography. There was no instruction booklet with it, so I had to figure out what the little pull-out piece was. Bluetooth remote. And when looking at the videos on how to operate it, I found it is the best stick for the money. I've already used it taking a video.The product review videos, all but one, don't show how to fit the camera into portrait mode; most of the videos show the landscape mode for a camera. But when I stumbled upon that one video, the lights went on in my head.I love the tripod feature, and the extendable pole. The ad shows taking it to the beach, but if you're okay with the pole extending to just two feet and no more, then you are good taking group photos.Keep in mind that things become a little unsteady the higher up you go extending the pole.",

                "reviewText": "I carried this little selfie-stick through most of Europe and I loved it. The way it reached out and took pictures, with the little remove control was phenomenal. I got some of the most amazing pictures and angles I ever dreamed possible. I had that thing dangling over castle walls in Scottland five hundred feet in the air, zooming in on the baseboards in the Louvre, speedboating along Italian coastlines, and surreptitiously shuttering pics at the Tower of London, and more. Yes, I loved it!However, it eventually broke on me. I have one of those new fangled, fancy type phones, because Samsungs outrank iPhones in everyway possible, so yeah, it has some weight to it. And yes, after several weeks of this little selfie-stick doing what I consider God's work for me, it eventually gave up the ghost. But believe me when I say I'll buy it again. The outreach is just the arm's length I need, and I can't brag enough about the clicking control I had with the little remote button.Because I was in the middle of an English countryside when it broke (Thank the old gods and the new it didn't break when I had it extended out past the Wallace Monument in Stirling, Scotland), I had to pop into a local shop to buy a new one, or different one rather), so I wasn't able to check investigate whether or not I could get a replacement, and by the time I got back to America, I just didn't care anymore. That's not the point. I really loved this selfie-stick and would definitely recommend.",
