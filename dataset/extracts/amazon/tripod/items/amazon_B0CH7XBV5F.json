                "reviewText": "This is a surprisingly sturdy tripod for the money. It is very stable with lots of head adjustments. The feet are flexible so that they are always sitting flat. The tripod has a good weight to it which would make it ideal for outside with wind. In addition it has a hook for an additional weight to increase stability. Although given the weight I wouldn't recommend for a travel tripod where you have to walk great distances. The head has a large number of adjustment knobs to obtain any angle you need. I really like that it allows you to go from portrait to landscape orientation with the turn of a knob. Also the head will unscrew and it easily becomes a monopod. It also comes with an extra quick release plate which is very nice in case you loose one or want one for more than one camera. It comes with a cell phone holder and carry bag as well. Everything fits in the bag. The cell phone holder is adjustable and will hold at least a Samsung S9+ size (see photo). The tripod has a handle that makes it easy to carry. I included a picture of the box with the specs for the tripod. It does come with directions although using it was easy to figure out if you have used tripods before. Finally, I have to add that I bought the blue one and love the color.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This thing is quite nice if you're looking for a tripod that can do a lot more than you expect. Sure you can use part of it as a trekking pole but the point of this is to have something that is sturdy yet light and adaptable to various environments and uses. This tripod does just that.My old tripod was much more simple with only telescoping legs at 1 level and it was time consuming to do. For this one you just flip the cover up and telescope up or down and lock it back into place.If you want to be more mobile and hands on, you can release the monopod and take a single pole with you. It's great for resting the pole on a nearby surface or fully telescope to account for standing. To see it in action, please see my video demonstration.It comes with a nice compact travel bag with shoulder strap. See picture.",

                "reviewText": "Since I don't use a tripod all that often, I didn't want to spend a ton of money on one. Truth be told, I originally was looking at a monopod to use to help stabilize things when using a telephoto for a long time. This does the trick....the mono unit fits right in the middle and can easily be separated from the base unit...just enough support to help....we all know how things can get heavy if holding them for a long time. The only problem I have with the mono unit is getting the leg to lock via the twist... I'm getting better at it, but my hands aren't all that strong any more. The tripod is easy to use! Legs and their adjustment are easy and secure with the flip logs. Everything folds down nicely and fits into a great zippered bag. It comes with a 2nd easy mount / quick release attachment...great if you want to use two different cameras..... I've only had this for less than 2 weeks, but I am pleased thus far...all in all, this tripod is a winner for me.",
