                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I got this to replace an Aureday tripod that I loved. Unfortunately, as great at the Aureday was, the plastic head snapped off. A buddy of mine had previously let me borrow his Victiv tripod, so I had a sense for what I was getting into.There is a lot to love about this. First, it is all aluminum. Second, it comes with an extra quick release plus attachment for a phone. It is super flexible, including being taken apart as a monopod, the rubber feet come off if you are filming on turf, and the knobs really do release the head to allow you to adjust angle as finely as you want. And it gets pretty tall -- around 7 ft.There is no handle to facilitate panning. That's a bit unfortunate for me, but again, I knew what I was getting into.My one long-term concern with this is the mechanism for locking the legs in place. Because it is spring loaded, it seems like this is the kind of thing that could get loose in the future with no real recourse to fix it. It is also a bit awkward to release the locks to get it back into the storage position. Moreover, this locking mechanism is also part of the reason why you really need to make sure that your legs are all fully extended away from each other to make it as level and stable as possible. Unlike the Aureday, for example, there is not a stabilizing set of connectors between the legs to ensure that they are all equidistant. I gather the Victiv chose not to go this route because they wanted to be able to hang a camera from underneath the tripod top to support macro photography.The bubble levels are VERY slow and very small. But they seem to work",

The horizontal adjustment is almost perfect, its just not quite smooth enough for video, a few little hicups in the mechanism that render shaking. For still frame or vlogging its definitely good enough. Its looks cool, so thats something. Its not a tripod I'm exactly proud of but I wouldn't throw it away either... unless it broke, which it hasn't... yet.",

                "reviewText": "I got this Tripod to switch off of the EOS rebel T6's bundled plastic tripod that comes with any kinda \"kit\" version you can buy. (specifically, mine was provided alongside the camera by my college, BUT you can buy various kits with the T6 that includes the cheap and easily broken tripod.) This thing is a league ahead the stock tripod and super luxurious. I thought the orange looked nice in product pics and it -does not- disappoint. My only complaints is the lack of a locking feature so the legs don't just crumple in on themselves if bumped (and in the small space I take product images, it get's bumped a fair bit) it does lock, but only keeps itself from opening further, not closing inward.additionally, one of the side bubble levers doesn't work. it just sticks to the top of the alignment tube. Not a big deal since I don't have any reason to be shooting on perfectly level ground in my use case, something to be aware of if you want like, very fine and accurate leveling.The ball joint style pivot for the camera itself is really good. the twist knobs work great and don't require much force to keep it dialed in, and you can keep it a little loose and move the camera around, let go, and it still hold it's place while you move to lock it in further in case it gets bumped. I love this so much, the stock tripods come with a little fold-out flap you can only tilt forward for angled shots and the locking mechanism broke like day 5 so it had two technical positions, forward or straight down towards the floor.You can take angled shots, straight up or down or sideways, and it has a notch on the neck for tilting it straight down if you wanna use it for recording something on your table or taking macro pics while stabilized and it's wonderful. comes with a holder for your phone which is a nice touch and can be partially disassembled to switch the camera to the underside of the tripod for some seriously close-to-subject shots. the rubberized feet grips come off and have spikes for outdoor shoots. I think it's got excellent stability all things considered in either scenario. Was able to get some amazing pics with a step ladder for near top-down photography on large subjects so, can attest to the full height not affecting stability too much (not sure about outdoor photography in high wind, that's a ballgame I'm not pitching in.) Definitely can hold some higher weight than starter, cheaper plastic tripods.It's got so many premium feeling features and a nice metal, sturdy build to make it a serious photographers leap from stock to something nicer with the looks to match.-if you for some reason like the stock, cheaper ones, Victiv also has one in the same orange color and look and feel for a fair bit less $ wise and some similar features.",
