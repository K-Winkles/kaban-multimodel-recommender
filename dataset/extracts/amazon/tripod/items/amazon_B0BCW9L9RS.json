It also seems well made.We also love the small size. It easily fits in my wife's sling bag. That makes it easy to carry when traveling.The flash style connectors are helpful as well. I found a small rechargeable light that fits that socket.The only downside is the small legs make it easy to tip over in the wind, but that true of all these selfie stick style \"tripods\". If it is a bit windy, we will try to toss a bag on the legs for stability. (we also sometimes carry an amazing small carbon-fiber travel tripod, but that requires a backpack or someone carrying it separately).We bought two more and gave one to a friend.",

Also, had to watch a video of a reviewer to figure out how to open the tripod part. Here are the tricks. The phone holder, you pull from one side of it and it has a spring attached to hold it together. Pay attention on how it comes out so you can put it back. The tripod handle, turn the ring half a turn and pull apart the habdle at the vottom. It may take some effort at first but seperate from the bottom of the handle. Now for the kicker. This thing will fend off someone if need be. Fully extend and swing away Meryl! Whack an attacker and break this thing on them. It is cheap enough to replace. You aren't! Probably won't work against a zombie or werewolf or even a sparkly vampire but it'll work on a person.",
