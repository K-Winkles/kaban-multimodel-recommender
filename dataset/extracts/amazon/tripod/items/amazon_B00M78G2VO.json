                "reviewText": "I use an Anker PowerConf C200 webcam for work and based on my monitor setup and their height, resting it along the top edge of either screen was not ideal. However, I have some space between the monitors and place the camera there. The problem is the camera itself does not have a solid base and it's highly prone to movement.This tripod solves that problem. It offers stability, protects the base of the camera from scuffs/scratching, is easy to use, and overall is a cheap upgrade. I've very happy with it and just ordered another one for a Logitech webcam that I also use.",

                "reviewText": "I use small tripods for video-conversations on my phone and I need them to be portable (small and light) and stable (to use on various surfaces). I got tired of all those plastic ones breaking, so I decided to try this metal one. While it seems like it will be much more durable (I've only had it for a week), it has other shortcomings:* The legs open at a very small angle, thus making it very unstable once the phone is attached to the top, especially in portrait orientation. Even when they are extended (which makes it even taller and inconvenient), it takes a lot of adjustment just to keep is standing on hard, flat surface.* The ball-head tightening mechanism can keep it in place but it is not progressive in effort and, thus, makes it hard to control the tightness. Also, the head of the wingnut is very small, exacerbating this problem. As a result, I often end up not tightening it enough and it tends to tilt and fall upon the slightest touch.Time will tell whether it is as robust as it appears, but it is hard to use and I may just have to keep looking.",

                "reviewText": "This Lightweight Mini Tripod from Amazon Basics was a life saver, I had bought this product back in November of 2017 and I am now in 2023, and I honestly think it's worth the money, or at least in my personal opinion. I have used this small yet durable tripod for years and it has not failed me at all. I did eventually buy a (SMARTPHONE HOLDING MECHANISM) (NOT INCLUDED) to screw onto the tripod, which you can buy separately. I have used this tripod to take pictures, either for social media or to promote my art on YouTube. I believe this tripod can be used in many ways, I have used it to record side views of my art process and also to use it on a daily basis to take still photos of nature and trips I've been on in the past. I also provided some photos included in this review to showcase the tripod in itself. Remember to pull on the rubber bumpers at the bottom of the tripod, trust me I thought it was a one height only mini tripod, but I was fooled, and I did not realize it had extending legs, so watch out for the unexpected height scare. Overall, I think this product is worth it, it is easy to use for timed photography or for social media projects/businesses. This is not a tall tripod, but it's a great alternative for anyone wanting to take pictures/videos for vlogging by setting the tripod on a table. Thank you all for reading. Happy Shopping! I hope I'll help you all with this honest review! ;)",

Disgusting delivery service.The lightweight mini tripod for the price seems to have good build quality, the legs extend but do not lock, they is enough resistance to support my TG-6 camera. The legs when collapse make it pocket sized (to match my TG-6), unfortunately the legs do not adjust out to give a lower platform. I am happy with it. Good price.",
