                "reviewText": "You need a tripod. The tripod needs to be able to handle your camera. This can handle a lot of weight. The tilt adjustment adds a fair amount of friction and feels great. Pan adjustment is either locked or free movement with no friction, so it\u2019ll be wild and takes a bit finesse and a light touch.I have used it for two gigs now with my c300mkii and it handles it well. It goes plenty tall and is nearly weightless in comparison to my old beast of a manfrotto tripod. A breath of fresh air really.So all in all it\u2019s a great tripod at an insanely low price that is built well enough to live in my kit for decades.If you\u2019re the type of filmmaker who thrashes gear to death then you may want something a bit more robust. But also you should sit down and meditate on why you treat your gear like it\u2019s rented and you have a vendetta against the producers to the point where you are insistent on leaving them with a massive L&D bill at the end of the show. Why are you like this??? And then\u2026 buy this tripod and treat it like it deserves to be respected, as do all the pieces of gear in your kit.So in closing: great tripod, great price, treat it well and it will return the favor.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars It's cheap and it's OK",
                "reviewText": "This is a cheap tripod, don't think it's more than that. There are hundreds of better performing tripods out there, but they will be more expensive. It is fine for the price. It will hold your camera in place and do it safe enough. Are there better fluid heads? Absolutely. Are there better legs? Absolutely. Is there anything out there that does what this tripod does for cheaper? I don't think so.Pros:1. The price. I got this on sale for $140. I've used a lot of tripods and a lot of different brands. You get a lot for that price point.2. The mounting plate seems nice, although finicky. If you use a DJI gimbal, it's nice to be able to use the gimbal plate. I'm all about plates becoming more universal even if I never use this feature.3. The quick release legs are easy to adjust on the fly. The head is overall easy to level with a clear level bubble.4. It's really light weight for it's size and how sturdy it is. And it is really sturdy.5. It has a lot of features you only see on higher end tripods like a bowled head, fluid head (although its not a true fluid head), adjustable pan and tilt, comes with a nice bag, includes tools, etc.6. It gives you a taste of what a real professional tripod might be like, even if it falls short in almost every category compared to real professional tripods.The cons:1. Cheap materials. One of the leg hooks was broken out of the box. My spreader screws were so loose they came undone in shipping and the hardware was flying around in the box. Lots of the plastics seem cheap and brittle throughout the tripod. I cannot imagine how this plastic would stand up in the cold. Typically really nice tripods are mostly metal, this has an overwhelmingly amount of plastic on it.2. Questionable longevity. I probably wouldn't trust this tripod to last long under daily shooting gigs. I bought this tripod knowing it would stay in a studio 70% of the time with light movement. I can't imagine the plastic on this thing will take years of beating like my manfrotto tripods.3. The fluid head adjustments are not very adjustable. They're just friction adjustments and are pretty finicky at best. If you need a high quality pan and tilt movement, just skip this tripod. It will get the job done, but after using a legitimate fluid head you'll notice the differences immediately.4. This kinda goes back to my first point, but the knobs and levers seems like the cheapest of the materials. I'm already concerned about catching them on something and snapping them.Even with my complaints, this is a fantastic CHEAP tripod. If you think you're getting E-image, Manfrotto, Sachtler, bogen quality, you are kidding yourself and need to double check the price and brand on this thing. Don't get me wrong, smallrig has some great accessories and their quality always seems to be good for the price, just remember the price on this is cheap and the tripod reflects that price in many ways, but it also out performs it's asking price in other ways. Just know what you're paying for.",
