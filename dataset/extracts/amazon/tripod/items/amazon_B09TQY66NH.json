                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the SENSYNE 62\" Phone Tripod & Selfie Stick, and I love it!!. As a new and upcoming photographer. I was on the lookout for an affordable yet reliable selfie stick that I could take with me anywhere that was not too heavy, and this tripod/selfie stick combo has proven to be an excellent choice. I am very short and could never hold the phone and take pics at the same time. This extendable feature of the tripod allows me to capture shots from various angles and heights, providing versatility to my photography. The 62-inch height is particularly advantageous for group photos or capturing stunning landscapes. The ability to transform it into a selfie stick adds an extra layer of functionality, making it an all-in-one solution for my photography needs. I don't have to stretch to get the perfect picture anymoreOne of the standout features, that I like is the wireless remote, which adds convenience to my photo sessions. Being able to control the shutter remotely ensures that I can be a part of the frame without any hassle. The setup is incredibly user-friendly, making it perfect for someone like me who is just starting in the world of photography. I love the price and the look of this stick. Highly recommend it!Not only is the SENSYNE 62\" Phone Tripod & Selfie Stick cost-effective, but it also delivers on performance. It's an ideal companion for any aspiring photographer, offering a seamless blend of affordability, ease of use, and functionality. I highly recommend this product to fellow beginners or anyone in search of a reliable and budget-friendly tripod/selfie stick solution.",

It was a cold, windy day and it held the phone steady and having the remote so someone didn\u2019t have to set a timer and rush back to get into the photo was nice. It is light weight, easy to set up, sturdy enough to hold the phone and withstand some wind, and the remote was easy to use as well. Would recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been wanting a tripod for a while. This was the most highly recommended one on Amazon so I took the plunge. It\u2019s amazing. It has locking levers on each level so you can really position the camera to any height you want. I haven\u2019t found a way to adjust the ANGLE of the camera down, only up. So iow I can\u2019t get a tall height and then tilt the camera at a downward angle. But maybe I just haven\u2019t figured out that part yet, idk. Also it\u2019s study-ish, but when it\u2019s fully extended, it\u2019s lightweight enough that I feel a brisk wind would knock it over. But I absolutely recommend it and give it full stars as it\u2019s perfect for us amateurs, though I can see where a professional might want to invest in something more top-notch. For $25 it really is almost perfect and well worth the money.",

This tripod is great. Very sturdy, light enough to carry around easy to take the phone off and on. High adjustment is great and the bonus is definite the Bluetooth remote. She can start her video or take a picture using the remote instead of having to walk up and away to start/stop her videos. Would definitely recommend.",
