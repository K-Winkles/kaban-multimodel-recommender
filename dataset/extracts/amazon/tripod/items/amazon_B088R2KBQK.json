                "reviewText": "Am actually a professional photographer and I\u2019ve worked with and owned a LOT of tripods. I\u2019ve used very cheap tripods and I\u2019ve also used very expensive tripods. But when I saw that this tripod cost $27.99, I needed to see how this could work with and for me.It\u2019s important to note that this is NOT a $200 tripod like a Manfrotto, etc. This cost $27.99 so in a way, you get what you pay for. But for that cost, it is 100% worth it. It is impressively light, it folds into a very small size and it is very easy to carry around. It holds a phone or a DSLR with ease, but you should be very careful if you happen to mount a DSLR to this. My DSLR cameras are expensive so I was a bit nervous when I used it, but it held up. Once you expand all the legs properly, you\u2019re good. For phones, this was perfect. I own a Pixel 4XL and as you can see in the pictures, this held it pretty well and actually had some more room (and it had the case on it!).The other impressive thing was that the locks on the tripod also seemed very carefully built for the price point (again, this is not an expensive tripod). When expanding the legs or adjusting the tilt handle, I didn\u2019t feel like it was still loose in any way. The quick release plate (the little part that attaches to your camera) is the standard 38mm that fits in almost every camera equipment, making this suitable for both phones and DSLRs. The height extends to about 55 inches but remember that the more you extend it, the more \u201ctop-heavy\u201d it becomes, making it more prone to tipping over. However, this is normal for a lot of tripods.Lastly, the remote shutter. At first, I was skeptical and didn\u2019t seem interested in using feature. As a blogger I take A LOT of pictures myself and usually, if am using my phone, I would setup the self-timer on it to do the job. The problem with that is, you\u2019re limited to 3, 5, or 7 shots. With this, you can shoot until you\u2019re satisfied. This thing works! The setup is very easy. Turn it on, go to your Bluetooth setting, wait for it to appear, tap it, and that\u2019s it. It pairs to your phone via Bluetooth as an input device, so you don\u2019t have to disconnect your Bluetooth headphones/speakers for this to pair. Once that is done, open up your camera and tap the remote shutter button to take a picture. Straight forward and easy.I really like this tripod. For the price point, it definitely exceeds its expectation.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I was recently asked to review the PHOPIK Phone Tripod and I gotta say I was pretty impressed.I'll start with the Pros.1. The tripod itself is actually pretty sturdy. The build quality feels pretty solid and it definitely does exactly what its intended for.2. The fact that its so light means you can strap it to your camera bag w virtually no extra weight added. Thats a big plus because sometimes I want a tripod and don't want to carry a big one with me all day.3. The inclusion of a Bluetooth remote was an extra added bonus. It's a nice touch that I accidentally overlooked at first. The ability to remotely shoot stills and video without touching your phone to avoid and shake is great or get selfies or yourself in group shots is smart.4. They're aren't any crazy bells and whistles here (which is good) its simple and intuitive to use. It's not overly complex.5. The price. $25.99 is actually great deal for this tripod. Remember it's a phone tripod after all. Dont break your bank.The Cons:1. It didn't come with instructions, which honestly isn't that big deal but some people will want that. Most people know how to pair a bluetooth trigger but maybe some don't and I could see someone getting frazzled with that. Again, personally, for me it's neither here nor there but it's worth mentioning.2. I mentioned that the build quality is solid and I stand by that but there's one piece I'd like to mention. The leg bracing. Its plastic and works perfectly fine but its thin. I know a lot of people tend to hang a shot bag or on bigger tripods hang a traditional sandbag from it but I don't recommend doing so. Like I said it's plastic which is understandable. If you want to add some weight for stability, hand a shot bag or a water bottle off of one of the pins.Conclusion:This piece of gear works really well, is a solid build and at the price I'd definitely recommend it. Again, the bluetooth is a nice add on and you cant beat the price. I've included some shots of the gear itself so you can see what it looks like in RL as well as time-lapse I did the other night. I'll part-two this when I take it on a portrait run.",

Very easy to setup and easy to put away. Perfect if you wanna record a day at the beach or at the park. The only issue is it's lightweight materials that can be bent if it gets hit with something. Other than that, it's a pretty simple and cost efficient product. I generally don't use bluetooth controllers since it's mainly for phones, but it pairs normally with any bluetooth device and can take pictures and whatnot like any other controller.",
