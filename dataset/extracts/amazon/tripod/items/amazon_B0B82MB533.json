This selfie sticks collapses to a portable size that I was able to easily fit into my backpack and carry on the plane with no issues. It expands to a great height that makes photos and video almost at eye level. When extended fully. The included Bluetooth remote was easy to pair with the phone. The mount grips my phone securely and is able to turn either vertically or horizontally. I don\u2019t think you can take off or change the phone mount. I wish there was an adapter to mount other tripod heads. While the tripod base is made of plastic, it appears solid. For the price, I would definitely recommend this selfie stick as it makes it easy to take solo or group pictures. it works great for me to take pictures and videos of my child and me. It\u2019s easy compact and very useful.",

I can take full body pictures or video standing, thanks to 60\" extension capability and little Bluetooth remote. It is like your own personal assistant which is extremely useful.Work well as regular selfie stick too, in a handheld option. When fully extended could be heavy for female hands, though.I love this tripod/stick. It works great, good quality. Easy to set up with Bluetooth, easy to use.",

                "reviewText": "This tripod is one of my favorites because it's not only sleek but also very practical. A lot of other tripods feature a very poke-y and rugged exterior making them difficult to bring around but this tripod is very smooth and small which makes it very portable!The first time I used it I will admit I struggled trying to get the \"legs\" to come off but turns out I wasn't applying enough pull force to get the legs to detach from the main body. Don't be afraid to use some force when using it the first few times. The product is quite sturdy and I'm guessing it's intentionally built this way so that it doesn't open while you're traveling about with them.The only thing that's stopping me from giving this product a full 5 stars is the remote control holder. The remote itself is great but the spot to store the remote control is very unreliable. The remote doesn't snap in very well into the holder spot and as a result the remote control often falls out when I'm traveling with the tripod. As such, I no longer bring the remote around with me anymore because I'm afraid it'll fall out and I'll lose it.Overall great product!",
