Expandable to various sizes from about 2-1/2\u201d to 10\u201d, locking button will make small 1/8\u201d increments while a spring loaded action accommodates larger devices. Has rubber grip pads on both angled ends won\u2019t slip out and avoids any scratches on a device. It opens enough to fit an iPad with a case on It. Standard screw mount 1/4-20 fits any common camera tripod. This is not a remote control type adapter, only an extension to allow using a tripod to hold devices.",

The closed (folded) phone got a smidge too thick. I also love that the push button at the back makes it easy to adjust the width of the holder. Try not to get rough with it, though. I don't think it would withstand a sportive action movement.",

This will fit my phones with a case!Because this is designed for a tablet, when using it with a phone, you actually have a grip to hold it with one hand while you access the touch screen or buttons with your other. I like it when shooting a simple video in the horizontal position.With the tripod thread, I've used it with several tripod devices and have had no issues.While it might be designed for tablets, I think this is a great holder for the bigger phones and especially for those with cases.",
