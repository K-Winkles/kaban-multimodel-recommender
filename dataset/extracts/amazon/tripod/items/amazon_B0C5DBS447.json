                "reviewText": "I can only echo what so many of the other positive reviews have already identified. Sturdy but light! *Articulated* rubber feet that help to keep the tripod stable and level. Speaking of\u2026 there is an incorporated bubble level near the mounting platform to assist in making the tripod level. There is a carry handle incorporated into the central tube that flexes flat and out of the way when not used. A hook at the bottom to hang a bag or add more weight for added stability. Two mounting plates for quick switching of devices. Bluetooth remote! Device holder is versatile by allowing both sides to be used for different sized devices. The list is almost interminable. I will say that contrary to another reviewer I had no problem leaving the head joint and adjustment handle attached and just folding it out of the way to make it fit in the included carry bag.This tripod is an amazing value for less than $30 and well worthy of it! Very highly recommend to anyone that is not in need of the highest professional requirements.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. As a social media content creator, I've gone through two tripods that simply didn't meet my needs. This tripod, my third ever tripod, is the best one I've ever owned! It is such a game-changer! It came with quite a few parts and bonus accessories, which were an unexpected surprise for me. What's even more outstanding is that it only cost me $25. Here are some of the things I love about it:-It is durable and sturdy. Its legs are made of good quality aluminum, and not plastic! It feels very substantial, and will definitely be able to hold heavier cameras without tipping over. But just in case your camera is on the bulkier side, it has a hook on the bottom, that allows you to anchor it down with something heavy. The tripod also came with additional rubber feet, that can be easily screwed on for better grip and stability.-I love that I can easily switch between devices! So it came with 2 quick-release plates. You basically attach your device to the quick plate. So it makes it very easy to switch between 2 devices without having to screw on said device every time you want to switch.-I love the remote bluetooth clicker. It is very responsive and works like a charm. Perfect for when you are taking solo shots.-I purchased this tripod with an upcoming overseas trip in mind. The head with the lever screwed on, cannot fit the carrying bag (you'd have to unscrew the parts first), so I plan on leaving that home, and just screwing on my DJI gimbal directly onto the tripod, as demonstrated in my video. This little change significantly enhances its portability.This might be on the heavier side, if you are planning to take it for travelling, but that's okay with me... A trade-off I'm willing to take for its sturdiness and reliability. As of now, I haven't discovered any flaws with this tripod. It's a high-quality, budget-friendly option that I recommend to anyone who enjoys filming content.",

                "reviewText": "1. Very nice tripod, but I was disappointed in the actual product when compared to online video reviews and photos.2. This does support my Canon EOS camera and lens that weighs about 5 lbs. and is far less than the 15 pound weight limit for this tripod.3. I was under the impression this was more heavy duty than it actually is.4. The handle feels very cheap but works.5. The leg extension locks are very secure6. Of course the 3 leg extensions get thinner and thinner as you extend them, but they are much thinner than I expected.7. The features are excellent which include:A. 360 degree rotation. Loosen the large round thumb wheel. Tighten in place when in position.B. The platform plate can be tilted up to 90 degrees. Loosen the \"Wing Nut\". Tighten to secure position.C. Vertical Rotation/Tilt Up & Down- up to 90 degree angle. Turn the handle counter clockwise. Tighten handle to secure position.D. Quick release mounting plate. You get 2.E. Center column height extension. Loosen large thumb wheel on the top of tripod legs. Raise center post. Tighten to secure position.F. Spring loaded phone/tablet mount.G. A Bluetooth remote shutter control for your phone camera.H. Bubble level window (Very Small)I. Travel /storage bag- Feels like flimsy nylon but is handy and will accommodate the tripod with the handle attached if the mounting head is tilted/ folded in the right position. It will also hold a few accessories.J. You get a 2 year warrantyBOTTOM LINE:For the price of less than $30.00 at the time of this review this is a good bargain and an excellent low cost entry level tripod for beginners or those on a budget. Great for cell phones, tablets, camcorders, SLR cameras and even microphones (with the right adaptor). Weight limit is 15 pounds. I would avoid this for very high end equipment. It still rates 5 stars.",

While this product does have metal legs everything else is strong plastic which is why is weighs so little. I like it if I just want carry a light tripod for travel. In my studio I usually go with an all metal tripod instead, just so you know, but those costs a lot more. For the price they ask though, this tripod is definitely worth it and I can recommend it, perfect for travellers with light gear or beginners. Super light to carry. You could mount small mirrorless cameras on it or iphones to vlog yourself. For heavier cameras I recommend an all metal tripod. (or both as I did).",
