                "reviewText": "When the tripod that I bought in 1965 lost a key element of one leg's locking mechanism while I was in the woods I went shopping for a new one. This product is the one I decided on based on the feature description, it's weight, and what seemed to be it's ability to adapt to any surface and terrain. I wasn't disappointed. I've taken it into the field twice now without problems. I haven't used the unipod feature since I have a good unipod I use when I need one. That said, I have disassembled the unit to extract the unipod. It comes apart smoothly and goes back together the same way. I would buy this product again if I needed a second tripod.",

                "reviewText": "I think the first thing I noticed about this was that it has such a solid feel - like an expensive Manfrotto tripod. It came packaged well in a durable case with attachments for SLRs or Phones. The legs are sturdy with locking mechanisms and adaptable to a tripod, monopod, or even an upside down tripod that lets the camera \u201chang\u201d from the middle of the legs.Definitely impressed with the durability on this - I\u2019ve even used it to hold an 18\u201d ring light. This was a great find!",
