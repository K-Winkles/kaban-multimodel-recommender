                "reviewText": "Before I say anything else I want to disclose that at the time of this review I am a sponsored GoPro Gold Athlete BUT I purchased this tripod outside of my sponsorship program at full price here on Amazon.Overall, this is a great little tripod but as some others have stated I was a bit surprised about the somewhat \"plasticky\" feel of the item. That being said, I USE my GoPro products heavily and in some quite spicy conditions and this tripod has worked beautifully. With no leg adjustments it can be a bit unstable especially when fully extended but that is to be expected really. It works great for its intended uses (as a handle/impromptu tripod), literally slips in my pocket, and the quality has held up over the few months I've used the tripod. I do wish the handle was rubberized however as it would make gripping the handle much more secure. The only reason I'm not giving this five stars is because again, as others have said, it just doesn't have that robust GoPro feel I've come to expect. Still, I think you'll be satisfied with the performance.",

                "reviewText": "This grip feels very stable and easy to hold. Its a bit smooth but the girth of the handle makes it comfortable regardless of hand size. I have large hands and my wife has small ones and we both liked the feel of it.The extension pole has a pleasant amount of resistance that gives confidence that it will always remain at the desired length although as the picture shows, it isn't very long but enough for selfies and small enough to fit in your pocket.The tripod keeps stable although I haven't tested on rough terain or in the wind. Overall this checks all the boxes and feels like a quality accessory",
