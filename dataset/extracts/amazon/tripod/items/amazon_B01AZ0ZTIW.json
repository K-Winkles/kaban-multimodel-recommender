                "reviewText": "I was looking for a new tripod to travel with and searched the internet, comparing dozens of models and styles, and stumbled upon this one. I bought it here on Amazon and have been using it now for a few months. Here's my review of it:PROS:The height. This measures in a lot higher than most other portable tripods (it's definitely tall enough to use as a main tripod).The cost. It's not much more than a cheap tripod, but less than half the price of a similar travel tripod from another company.The build. It feels solid, and is made of metal. It doesn't feel like it's going to break.The weight. It's nice and light-weight, but that doesn't mean it'll fall over. It has a hook you can attach weights on to give it some extra weight. I usually hang my backpack with some gear in it to hold it down, and it feels very sturdy. I could imagine carrying this tripod around all day and not worrying about its weight.Its support. It can hold my DSLR without a problem, and I'd feel comfortable putting more weight on it.Portability. It folds up quite small. Not as small as other models, but not too long. I can put it in the side of my backpack, or just sling it over my shoulder. If it were a few inches smaller, it would likely cost twice as much or more, so I can live with that.The ball head. I know this might be a con for some people, but I actually like the small ball head. It's not easy to use compared to a standard larger fluid head, but it's nice to have something included so I don't have to bring my own.Monopod. I never even use a monopod 99% of the time, but it's really nice that it can also become one without too much work. The main leg twists off easily, and you can attach the head directly to it to become a monopod. This would allow you to film from higher up as well. Personally I probably won't use the monopod except for a few specific times when filming B roll but it's a plus.Spikes. It actually has retractable leg spikes. This is kind of rare among inexpensive, light-weight, portable tripods. Granted I don't film outside much so I haven't needed spikes, but they could come in handy.CONS:Twist joints. I wish the leg joints snapped instead of twisted. The twisting isn't bad or anything and they feel snug, but snaps really are a bit nicer.The length. I think it's nice and short when folded up, but I wish it were physically possible to be smaller when folded completely up. Anyway, not a problem, just an observation. I needed the tripod's height so I guess I can live without it being able to fit into my pocket or something. I'm asking too much.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Compact, good for travel, and well-designed",
                "reviewText": "The tripod comes in a carrying case with a velvet bag around the ball head, fully assembled in the tripod configuration. Inside the carrying bag is a hex key (which fits into the screws on the legs and ball head), instructions for converting the tripod to a monopod, and an adapter screw for turning the tripod into a monopod.The tripod is very well-designed and folds up wonderfully for travel. Even with the included carrying case, it can fit comfortably in a carry-on sized suitcase or backpack. It is light enough to carry comfortably, but not so light that I would be worried about vibration problems, especially since there is a convenient and easily accessible hook for hanging weights. The legs feel very sturdy and can independently lock in different positions, which is great for uneven surfaces. It is also possible to shoot straight down with the ball head. The black carbon fiber finish is very professional-looking, and doesn't get too hot or cold easily the way aluminum and other metals would, which is good for when you're shooting in very hot or cold environments.As a side note though, the bubble level is part of the attachment point for the camera. This means that it only tells you if the camera itself is level, not if the entire tripod is level. While this is fine for my own purposes, some of you might find this problematic because it means that (side to side) panning might not be on a horizontal level if the entire tripod is tilted.Also, there are *not* any spiked feet included or built into this tripod. That's okay with me, but if that is a must-have for you, you might want to either buy spiked feet separately to screw in, or look at a different tripod. The feet are removable though, so I'd say just buy the spikes separately.The monopod feature was a little confusing at first, especially since the instructions aren't the greatest, but I figured it out. For those of you having trouble with the monopod:- The leg with the logo on it unscrews from the tripod.- To remove the main shaft (the one with the ball head on it), unscrew the hook from the shaft, loosen the main shaft height adjustment until the shaft slides freely, and then slide out the main shaft.- There is a small adapter screw included with the kit. You might have to dig around in the bag to find it. (This is where I got confused - I didn't know the adapter existed at first, and couldn't figure out how to join the main shaft and leg.)- Screw the adapter into the main shaft first. Only one end of the screw will fit, so you'll know which side is right. Screw it all the way in.- Now screw the shaft + adapter piece into the leg you unscrewed earlier.- Celebrate by taking some awesome photos!I have included pictures of everything I mentioned in this review so you can see what I'm talking about. (They were taken with my phone, not my nice camera. Sorry!)Overall, this is an excellent tripod which serves my needs well. I would definitely recommend this if you're looking for a semi-professional, but still travel-friendly and easily portable tripod. I feel comfortable trusting this tripod with my expensive equipment at any angle or configuration, as it is solidly constructed and very stable.I hope this review was helpful to you.",

I mean it does everything this will kinda but this makes you want to make excuses up just to use it. Don't be a me an spend another 70 to end up buying this anyways. If your reading this like I read others cuz it's a lot of cash for what it does then read no more buy it once you have it you'll forget the cost an just live with happy thoughts it's the Ferrari of tripods",
