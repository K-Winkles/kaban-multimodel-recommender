                "reviewText": "This selfie stick/tripod combo appears well made of quality materials. In the tripod mode, it is quite sturdy, even when extended to full height. I used the tripod to record my very first Amazon video product review and it worked great. The tripod was tall enough for the feet to be on the floor and extend high enough to look over the top of a counter. It could also be short enough to sit on a counter and capture a good look at the work surface. Figuring out how to extend the tripod feet was a challenge, as was how to fold it back up. The phone clamp fit my iPhone mini very well. It could be stretched maybe 3/4 of an inch (2 cm) more, so I think it would accommodate most smart phones.As a selfie stick, it seems a little heavy in the hand. That is, no doubt, due to the tripod feature so it is an acceptable compromise for what you get. When extending the telescoping selfie stick, it is pretty stiff and requires some effort. The shutter, remote, control works easily and reliably.All in all, it seems like a good product.",

                "reviewText": "The various ways that things can be held by this tripod are the strengths of this tripod. I needed a solution for holding a shotgun microphone as well as a iphone last night during my children's orchestra concert last night. The plan I had to use an action camera for it's low light visibility didn't work out because we were too far from the stage. I had to revert to using an iphone to record but didn't really have a good way to hold both things on a single tripod.This tripod allowed me to hold the shotgun microphone on the 1/4\" adapter on the top of the tripod and hold my phone on the phone holder at the same time with the two connected via cord.The tripod is light and it was stable. It was also pretty easy to set up. Some of the parts seemed a little fragile though since they were made of plastic. I don't plan on using this tripod a lot but I might be a little concerned with the parts as they go through the rigors of attaching things on/off and screwing things in/out.This is recommended for the value it offers.",

                "reviewText": "This combination tripod/selfie stick is very simple and easy to use. It is very compact and lightweight since it is made from both plastic and metal. To set up the stand you pull up and outward on the legs. Then, lock the legs in place with the screw-on cap. Gently but firmly pull up on the mount to extend the metal telescoping post. The phone can be mounted in either the horizontal or vertical postion and tilted forward or backward. To make it into a selfie stick simply loosen the screw-on cap and close the stand portion back up into the original postion. Then, tighten the screw cap back on. The remote works well but is very small. (I attached a string to it so I won't lose it.) There is a tiny on/off switch on the side of the remote. Once you turn it to the on postion you can connect to your phone by pressing the main button on the remote. After connecting to my phone I went into my settings and renamed the remote to \"tripod\" to make it easier to find the each time I use it. Overall, this tripod/selfie stick is a very good product that is easy to use. I recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "My teenage son asked me for a selfie stick, assuming he wants to make videos. He figured out how to use this quicker than I did, and I still have to ask him to help me with the tripod. The tripod, when extended to it's full length, does not seem very sturdy and I don't think we'll be using that much. For it's lower (desktop) length, it's fine. It took me a moment to figure out the remote (I didn't see the on/off switch at first), and once I figured out what device it was on my Bluetooth settings, I was good to go. How easy it is to take pictures (and video).One thing I am pleased about is that I can fit my phone on without having to remove my case (same with my son's phone of course). That would be an absolute dealbreaker for me if I had to take the case off every single time I wanted to use it. I do think that it (especially the tripod) needs to be more sturdy though before I would absolutely recommend this.",
