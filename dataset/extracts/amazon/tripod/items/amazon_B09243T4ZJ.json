                "reviewText": "Super sturdy. This thing feels really expensive and looks really expensive. If you are in need of a tripod/monopod that can reach ground level macro all the way up to about 7 feet tall this is for you. Great for those downward angle portraits. The one leg comes off easily to use as a monopod/hiking stick for quick sturdy photos on hikes or even just around town. The tripod also has many many different heights/angles. The legs can be set wide for outdoors landscape shots or narrow for crowded museum shots. Very easy to use as well. All fits in a nice little zip up travel bag. Pretty light but still has that expensive kinda weight to it. The color is really striking too. It has a level built in for even photos. Get this! Don\u2019t bother with more expensive versions because the quality is the same as the ones that are hundreds of dollars. I use it with my Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR and multiple lenses including a very large 420mm-800mm telescopic lens. I friggin live this thing.",

The legs are pretty sturdy, and you can move around it a lot - the clips for the legs are well made.Do not expect the top of the line quality, its not it.

                "reviewText": "I purchased this recently since my older tripod has seen better days. I purchased this one specifically based on, what seemed like a good balance between features, price and apparent quality. It's a bit heavier than I anticipated; I wouldn't want to have to carry it backpacking, but it's fine for normal transporting. The quality seems to be fairly good, and I expect it will hold up well. I'm not sure the The legs are easy to adjust, and it collapses down surprisingly small for such a tall tripod. There only seem to be two \"gotchas\". The legs don't quite seem to be the same length when fully extended; the tripod sits at a slight angle, but they are easy to adjust. The only other issue is the levers that latch and secure the folding portion of the legs into place are a bit awkward to use. It seems as if they don't have a fixed pivot, requiring one to place a little bit of side pressure, in addition to the downward pressure to be able to open the latching mechanism and fold the legs. It just a little more effort to close up than I would have expected. The pivot and ball head seem to be pretty good and both have smooth action. It came with an extra quick release plate, which is nice, and it came with a phone mount bracket which seems okay. Additionally, it came with some small Allen wrenches, which I suppose are handy in the field if something begins to loosen. I'm not sure how I would feel trusting it to support a 30+ pound DSLR camera and lens at full height, or even close to full height, but then again if I had a camera +lens combo that weighed that much, I would probably NOT be buying a $59 tripod.",

                "reviewText": "Das Stativ dient mir als Halterung f\u00fcr meine Surround Mikrofon-Systeme. Diese bringen schon mal 8 kg (inkl. Kabel) auf die Waage. Daher brauchte ich ein Stativ, das diese Last ohne Probleme tr\u00e4gt.Zun\u00e4chst habe ich nur eins gekauft und ausgiebig getestet. So habe ich einen Eimer (10 l) mit Wasser gef\u00fcllt und mit einem Brett darunter auf den Kopf des Stativs bei maximaler H\u00f6he (205 cm!) gestellt.Selbst bei b\u00f6igem Wind hat das Stativ alles souver\u00e4n \"gestanden\".Das man es mit ein paar Griffen in ein One-Pole Stativ verwandeln kann, findet ich wirklich super!Denn h\u00e4ufig sind sog. \"Drehgenehmigungen\" f\u00e4llig, wenn \"das Stativ den Boden ber\u00fchrt!\" (O-Ton). Nun, mit einem One-Pole auf den Fu\u00df gestellt, ber\u00fchrt das Stativ definitiv nicht den Boden => keine Drehgenehmigung f\u00e4llig. ;-)Sch\u00f6n finde ich, da\u00df man das Stativ sehr schnell auf- und abbauen kann, die Arretierungen sicher einrasten und halten. Zusammengeklappt ist es wirklich sehr kompakt und mit rund 1,8 kg zwar kein Leichtgewicht, aber wenn etwas das 5,5-fache seines Eigengewichtes tragen kann, muss es halt etwas stabiler gebaut sein.Sehr hilfreich ist auch der kleine Haken unten an der Mittelstange der ausfahrbaren Stange. Hier kann man eine Tasche oder Rucksack anh\u00e4ngen und den Schwerpunkt des Stativs noch ein St\u00fcck weiter nach unten verlagern, was zus\u00e4tzliche Stabilit\u00e4t bedeutet.Wenn ich an meine Mikrofon-Systeme noch die f\u00fcr Au\u00dfenaufnahmen erforderlichen Windschutze anbringe, wird die Angriffsfl\u00e4che f\u00fcr den Wind noch gr\u00f6\u00dfer. Sobald das System dann hin und her wackelt, ergeben sich Phasing Effekte auf den Aufnahmen, die sie ruinieren.Mit diesem Stativ bewegt sich nichts mehr im Wind und als sich dann doch etwas zu bewegen begann, habe ich aus Sorge, da\u00df mir dicke \u00c4ste aus den B\u00e4umen auf den Kopf fallen abgebrochen. Andere Leute nennen das Starkwind oder fast schon Sturm.Ich finde das Stativ so gut, da\u00df ich mir schon ein zweites gekauft habe.Ein Detail m\u00f6chte ich noch besonders herausheben: Die Universal-Schnellwechselplatte! Sehr solide und die Arretierung ist schnell zu l\u00f6sen und h\u00e4lt alles sicher am Platz. Das mitgelieferte Werkzeug-Set ist hilfreich, besonders wenn man wie ich die beiden kleinen Sicherungsschrauben an den schmalen Ende der Universal-Schnellwechselplatte nicht ben\u00f6tigt.Alles in Allem: Klare Kaufempfehlung f\u00fcr Leute, die schwerere Lasten (10+ kg) sicher am Platz halten wollen!",

Le fait de pouvoir en extraire un monopode est vraiment un plus qui peut se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler pratique et \u00e9vite d'avoir les deux s\u00e9par\u00e9s \u00e0 promener ou d'avoir \u00e0 choisir lequel prendre. Cela prend un peu de temps et d'habitude pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer le monopode mais on s'y fait. Je ne suis pas un fan des bagues pour bloquer les pieds mais je sais par exp\u00e9rience qu'elles r\u00e9sistent mieux au temps que l'autre syst\u00e8me (dont j'ignore le nom)",
