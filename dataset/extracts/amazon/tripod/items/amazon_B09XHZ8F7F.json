Messaging back and forth with the seller, they kindly replaced this item - 5 of 5 customer service stars! As previously noted, the stem fractured at the base of any connection after falling over rendering it unuseable. I was honest the cause of use and truly appreciate the vendor replacing so that I can start a new season livestreaming. This is a great travel size and really was not looking forward to a larger option. FYI - This past week I livestreamed with another recording by cell with a much larger stand. I truly appreciate how quickly I can set this up and though I needed to position on a sloped incline, the adjustability of the phone holder and angles still provided a great view. Thank you! I purchased this to livestream using my iphone volleyball games. Our club had another tripod that was more complex and more complex to set up and was always having issues. With travel, this is compact and easy to set up. (I never used the bluetooth remote or other connectors). With volleyball, I need to stay next to stand to protect both my phone and tripod. The phone connector was simple and easy to adjust both locations and angles and stayed sturdy. One challenge was the volume control - I livestream with my phone sideways. The compression to best balance hits near the volume controls. so it's offcenter/balance to not have those interfere. We had one tournament that was a 2nd level above view and the height adjustability as well as the variety of locking angles (up/down) was so simple and easy and secure. Unfortunately a ricochet ball bounced into the tripod (no phone) and knocked it down. The tripod broke at the base stem, rendering it unuseable. We taped the backside of the phone holder to the top few inches of the stem to be able to live stream those last games, but all functionality except holding the phone at at now shorter height is gone. I am evaluating purchasing this again or another option as we may switch from my phone to a tablet with app scoring overlay for the next season. In all - I gave it a rating of 2 for sturdiness of 1 because with tipping over (which again, I did my best to avoid) it snapped and basically shattered. Again, my fault, but not a completely unexpected possibility of happening. More positive features are the simplicity of set up and it was super compact and lightweight for travel. It was a good little tripod for what we needed.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for making videos for my instagram, and is AWESOME. Very sturdy, durable, easy to carry around anywhere. The pouch that came with it is great, I love that it's on a drawstring. You can carry it over your arm, place on a suitcase, in/on a backpack, really nice for on the go.It holds my phone in place very sturdy, even my kids have trouble trying to twist the screws to adjust it (they're very young, so they think it's a game, haha) I like that it also has a separate holder attachment for a GoPro, I don't own one, but someday maybe I will? That makes this versatile for all Creators!And can we talk about the Bluetooth remote? It's very convenient (it works with zero lag, have not had any issues) I used it for a little photoshoot with my husband even, i hid the little remote well so you could not see me holding it in the photos.Overall, the value of this is FANTASTIC. I love this so much and it was one of the tripods I've EVER HAD. I've owned a Ring light Tripod, and numerous ones for actual digital cameras..this takes the cake.Oh, and it dropped real hard and you can't even tell! Nothing broke, Thank GOD!This is a great investment for taking photos hands free or if you're a creator and take videos!!",

The telescoping extension main tube was quite stiff to pull out but stayed put firmly. My Samsung Galaxy S22Ultra phone attached easily to the holder. The remote control was easy to pair on the smartphone with simple instructions in the included paper manual. The battery was a standard CR2032 and was included in the package. I took these three shots as I approached the tripod in sequence to check the autofocussing in low light which turned out well. I don't expect to use this much but it folds up into a small package that fits the enclosed case for stowing or carrying. While it held the smartphone firmly, I don't think it is sturdy enough to hold a DSLR camera and lens securely but then this tripod is not intended for that purpose. Good product. Seems well made.",
