                "reviewText": "In short I am happy with and recommend this tripod.Now a little more detail. I am an amateur or enthusiast/hobbiest that just wanted a decent tripod to hold a light camera. I\u2019m not a professional and this was the most expensive tripod I have bought. That being said for my use case I am more than satisfied with what I got for my money.Pro\u2019s:It\u2019s a versatile sturdy tripod that can go very tall, I\u2019m 6 feet tall and it can go above my head so more height than I will probably ever use.It can convert into a monopod easily, need to unscrew a leg and reattach it to the ball head so I don\u2019t think I would do it much on the fly but if I want to be more mobile/compact and take some photos at a school event I think it would be perfect to convert before I go.Ball head seems to be very well made and works great for what I want to use it for.The quick detach plate is easy to use and it\u2019s really nice that they include 2 with the tripodI was very surprised at how nice the carry bag was, felt durable and had a little padding in it. Also, surprisingly compact for its max height.Con\u2019s:The weight hook seems a little flimsy to me, plastic screw in piece with a metal hook. Has a light spring on it. Seems like it would be fine for a small camera bag 8lbs or less. But not ideal for a heavy backpack. That being said, I don\u2019t plan on using the hook much as it\u2019s sturdy without a counterweightThe leg lock tabs seem loose when I use them to adjust the legs, they slop around quite a bit as I move between the different lock points. Once they are engaged its sturdy so I\u2019m fine with it considering the price of the whole thing.",

                "reviewText": "I shopped quite some time before deciding on this tripod. It is probably the nicest, heavy duty tripod I've ever owned complete with an adjustable ball and socket head as well as quick release adapters for your cameras, cell phone adapter bracket or even telescopes. It is definitely a solid, well-built and sturdy tripod as I tested it in some pretty strong winds (40+ mph) in Utah and New Mexico. The price was very good too for a tripod of this caliber. The connections were solid and the quick adjust lock levers for the legs made setup very quick and easy. It even came with additional quick mount plates, extension tube and removable rubber feet. Removing the rubber feet exposes stainless steel spiked feet which are great to plant the tripod legs firmly into the ground. I also really like the flexibility of being able to reverse the center tube and head to allow macro photography of objects close to the ground without having to lay on the ground for great close-up shots. Solid footing/mounting makes lengthy, timed exposures and hyperlapse mode possible for incredible night photography (as shown from our recent trip to Utah). I highly recommend this tripod to anyone for photography with cameras, cellphones or even telescopes!",

                "reviewText": "Overall, I am very pleased with the Jolican 81\u201d tripod. It is a great value for the price and offers a lot of features that you would expect from a more expensive tripod. The compact size and light weight make it easy to carry around, while the sturdy construction and smooth ball head make it a pleasure to use. The only downside is the weakness of the clips on the adjustable legs they seem to weak and allows the legs to slip to a shorter length.If you are looking for a reliable and affordable tripod, the Jolican 81\u201d is definitely worth considering.",

Very well built, excellent workmanship, and it even came with a cellphone attachment, even though the owners manual said it wasn\u2019t included. If you\u2019re looking for a fantastic, on-the-go addition to your camera equipment, look no further. I even love it more than my big, bulky, $300+ \u201cprofessional\u201d tripod. Enough good things can\u2019t be said about this product.",
