In its lowest position I measure it at 18 inches tall so it goes pretty low to the floor. In its tallest safe position it measures 60 inches, that\u2019s with legs in widest position.It\u2019s always best to use a ballast weight like a small sand bag to prevent tipping over. I would not advise using this with any large or heavy light. It\u2019s made well enough for light duty and the price is fair.",

It folds up quickly and small. All parts work smoothly and appear to be made from quality materials.I compared it to several other similar light stands and there is no comparison in the quality of the materials or portability.Probably the most important feature (since I will be recording sound) is that it is completely silent.

                "reviewText": "This Ulazi light stand is well made with good quality aluminum and plastic materials. It folds to less than 17 inches making it portable to bring on locations. Ulanzi is a new company that makes well designed and good quality products. Ulazi products reminds me of the company Smallrig who has been around for years making well designed good quality products. This light stand is basically a tripod. It mimics a tripod's ability to adjust the angle of each of the three legs from almost parallel to the ground to 180\u00b0 upright towards the mounting spigot making the overall size much more compact for travel. Tripods have done this for years so I am surprised this is only one of the first lightstands to copy this feature. This is a great lightstand for lower required heights. At a little over 6 feet tall it is a little short for portrait use unless you use this for seated portraits and baby portraits. I prefer my lightstands to be at least 8 feet tall for adult portraits. Using my Godox AD200 strobe is the heaviest I would feel comfortable putting on this at full height. At lower light heights I would flatten out each leg and place a sandbag weight on the legs to allow for more stability with much bigger and heavier strobes and softbox. I have also used this lightstand with my gimbal and smartphone conected to record video. My gimbal has person tracking that will track the person vertically and horizontally. In this setup this lightstands works brilliantly.

                "reviewText": "For half the cost of the Chinese-made Italian standard otherwise known as the Nano - this light stand hoists up higher; holds more weight; folds down shorter; and is arguably more stable! Don't get me wrong - I've got several Nanos and I like them a lot... but this stand has some clear advantages.The first thing I really like is that the legs function like a good tripod. They are independent and lock in three different angles - and each has a telescoping section. As a result you can negotiate uneven terrain like a pro. Since they fold up against the mast - no space is wasted and the the folded length is only ~17 inches!Also since each leg has a telescoping section - the legs can spread very wide offering a big stance and more stability. Need even more stability? If you aren't overloading the stand - hang a weight like a backpack from the hook beneath the mast and let that low center of gravity work in your favor. Excellent when working with light modifiers like umbrellas and softboxes.I also really like the satin black anodized aluminum with matching hardware. It looks great and professional. My only nitpick is I wish the clamping hardware was adjustable so that in the future should they get a little loose I would have a way to tighten them back up.All things considered - I'm pleased with this light stand and plan to order a few more.",

                "reviewText": "Ulanzi never disappoints me. This is a great light stand. It is made of aluminum and is light weight yet sturdy. The bars extend easily and tighten nicely. I did not notice any slipping of the bars once extended. The top has a \u00bc\u201d threaded mount which fits most everything I have. It only extends to about 6 feet which is fine for many situations. It would be nice if it was a little higher, though. When fully collapsed, it is a great size for carrying. The bottom legs also have extensions. All the bars are slightly crimped which in my opinion adds to the sturdiness and ensures the stand will not bend. The hinging mechanisms are sturdy as well. Overall it\u2019s a five star stand.",
