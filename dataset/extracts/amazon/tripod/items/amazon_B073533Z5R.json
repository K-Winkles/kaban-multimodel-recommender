(As long as you have a clamp style head on your tripod!)I purchased this to use on my 3 Legged Thing tripod and it fits the head perfectly. The clamp itself is lage enough to facilitate very large phones, and the fact that it folds down so compact is great if you're on the go. 10/10 would buy again!",

                "reviewText": "First, it looks great. I got the red one, and it's pretty great-looking. I like its sturdy aluminum build, its form factor is efficient, and well-built. I have a Google Pixel 7 with a fairly slim Moment case, and this fits sideways with no problem. Seems secure, though I don't really walk around with it. It sits on a small tripod on a table. I like the \"hidden\" cold shoe for accessories on top, because I do attach a mic and light to it. It only has one shoe, I attach the mic to the light's shoe. My cons are minor. My Pixel 7 does not fit vertically in the holder, and there is no swivel to flip the phone 90 degrees. It's a minor con, because I don't usually record vertically. But the option would be nice. This one isn't solely on the holder, but, the arms the hold the phone take up a bit of room, causing the phone to have to sit off-center because of the power and volume buttons. Not a big deal, but thought I'd note it. Overall it's a pretty great phone holder, and depending on your phone, I'd recommend it.",

Even that, I still love it and use it all the time because it gives me a peace of mind knowing my phone won't fall off the bracket \ud83d\ude00",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for an inexpensive device that would allow me to use my Arca-Swiss-style ball head with an iPhone. This one seemed worth a try for the price, but I didn't expect it to be nearly as good was what I received.It's very nicely designed and well-made, the moving parts fit tightly and line up very nicely, so the phone fits snugly when I close the clamp down.The screw mechanism works fine, the pieces are a bit loose in that there's quite a bit of play in this part of the item, but it doesn't appear to be a concern. Using the screw to move the clamp up or down initially was very squeaky and not smooth, but a bit of 3-1 oil sorted that right out and now the movement is quiet.The one other element that isn't just right (besides the looseness of the screw and guide rods) is that the bottom plate doesn't fit as smoothly into the ball head as my other Arca-Swiss plates. I have several plates for mounting DSLR bodies and various lenses, and each of these (albeit more expensive) plates has a slightly narrower base which allows the plates to fit more easily into the ball head. The Ulanzi base plate is wider than my other plates and too wide to place into the ball head's clamp from the top as I'm accustomed to doing. I have to slide the Ulanzi into the ball head's clamp, and then because the Ulanzi fits the space so tightly there is not much room to snug the ball head's clamp down. This is not much of an issue because a phone is very light and you don't need a lot of torque on the clamping screw. But it still feels a bit weird compared to using the other plates which, being slightly narrower, allow me to crank down on the clamping screw for a very tight fit.Overall I'm very pleased with the item and recommend it if you want to use a phone on your Arca-Swiss ball head.",

One good thing is once you expand the clamp to accomodate your phone, the top portion of the camp is tight and doesn't fall back if the phone is not there.Along with the arc-swiss mount, it has a thread at the base to attach in non-arca style tripod/monopods too. Very nice touch. Only thing is price could've been little less.Overall v nice product.",
