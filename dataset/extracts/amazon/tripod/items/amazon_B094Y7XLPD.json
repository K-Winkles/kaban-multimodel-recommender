                "reviewText": "I purchased this product, in part because I hoped it, in fact, had the phone attachment as pictured in the last image of the promotional sequence this page. It does not. I believe they should change out that last image just to make it clear the tripod is ready for other cameras, but not phone cameras. The neck also does not raise, in case you wondered. Otherwise it seems fine. Product is made in China and has instructions and specs. printed on the box in English, German, and Chinese. The ball can pivot and tilt the head to about a 30 degree angle, give or take, on each of three sides. The fourth side has a slot where the ball can pivot the head to a 90 degree angle. The ball is very tight, out of the box. Lubricating it a little should allow easier movement without compromising one's ability to \"stick\" the position of the camera. The tripod is light weight, seems sturdy, and easy to grip.",
