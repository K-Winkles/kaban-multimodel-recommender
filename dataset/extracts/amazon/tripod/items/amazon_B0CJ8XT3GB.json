Nice protective case that holds all the accessories so you're sure to get everything with you in your adventures.Decent length extendable mounting stick which is the main reason for this purchase. I mainly bought it because the price difference at the time was a couple of bucks between the selfie stick tripod and the \"many accessories\"Now the bad... You get so many accessories, yet so little use for all of them. 60 accessories that could probably be reduced to 30 easily. Reason being is many of them are duplicates. I understand each \"accessory\" is for \"head mount, wrist mount,... Etc\" many of them could be re-purposed for all the accessories.Now the verdict. If you bought bought the camera (which is why you're buying the accessories) it'll come with a few accessories that in my opinion could spare you from purchasing those accessories. Only thing doesn't come with the camera is the tripod\\stick that I'll recommend buying.",
