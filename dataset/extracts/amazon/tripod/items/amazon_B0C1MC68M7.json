                "reviewText": "Wow, this tripod is a game-changer! I've used a few tripods in my time, but this one takes the cake. First off, the stability is top-notch. The aluminum alloy and rubber pads on the legs make it super sturdy, even when I'm out and about. I've used it for selfies, vlogging, and even some dance practice videos, and it's never let me down.The height adjustability is a lifesaver. It goes from about 17 inches to a whopping 64 inches, making it perfect for all kinds of shots. Plus, the built-in bubble levels are a nice touch for getting that perfect alignment.The universal phone and tablet holder is another win. It securely holds my iPhone 13 Pro Max and even my iPad Air. No wobbling or slipping, just a firm grip.And let's talk about the Bluetooth remote. It's so convenient for group shots or when I need to step away from the camera. It works like a charm up to 33 feet away and connects effortlessly.In short, if you're in the market for a versatile, reliable tripod, look no further. This one's a keeper!",

                "reviewText": "Found an app that turns a phone into a remote web camera. Got this tripod to set up to watch the birds at my feeder. The thing is amazing. It has 4 leg clips per leg to allow many different heights and it also has a center tube that you can further adjust height. And to top it off it has a bubble level. This thing is very versatile. As for sturdiness, it's holding a phone, not a box camera, so it is plenty sturdy for that purpose.",

                "reviewText": "This is the third tripod Ive ordered because the other two were not flexible enough. I wanted to take video of something lying on a table and the others would not let the phone bend at a 90 degree angle toward the floor, they only went to the left and right.This one is adaptable for almost any angle you can imagine. Additionally, you can set this one up so that the tripod legs do not interfere with the photo area - which is a problem I had with previous ones.The remote is ok, but not the best Ive seen. It has a button for Andriod and a button for iPhone, but both buttons work with my Android.The legs and stem lock into place so there is no unexpected collapsing. You can use it as a selfie stick, but it is optimized for use as a tripod.",
