                "reviewText": "I have a couple of small desktop tripods that were O.K., but didn't like that I always had to use one of those plastic mounts that you had to pull out the arms to attach your phone. Some of them barely opened far enough to accommodate my iPhone with its case on (it makes me a little nervous not having my case on my phone when it's on a mount like that).That's exactly why I got this Magnetic Mini Tripod Mount for Magsafe iPhone. My iPhone attaches via a MagSafe mount and boy does it do that great. The magnetic is strong AND I get to keep my case on. For those that don't have a MagSafe case, they include the magnetic rings which is a nice add. It also comes with a regular tripod mount to for DSLR camera of video cameras.The ball joint is great and allows for 360 degree rotation and is super light. The flexible legs are a lifesaver and know I'm going to be able to get those shots I was never able to get with my other non-fleixible tripods.Compact and very portable, this tripod is a win all the way!",

Great when trying to get the right angle and height when setting on top of another hard surface like a table or countertop. The legs are a Gumby-type moldable material so you can pretty much bend them wherever needed to get the exact height and angle needed. While the tripod has a standard camera screw mount, it also includes a magnetic mount for iPhones and others when using a compatible case or by attaching one of the included metal rings to any device that will be mounted. Overall, the flexibility makes this a really valuable piece to have handy.",

I have the new iPhone, and a MagSafe case, which works great with us.The package also comes with metal rings you can put on your phone if your phone does not have the MagSafe metal magnet ring. This thing holds my phone upright and could be tightened and loosened to create the perfect scene. I have no issues with this and will be using it for mini live stream going forward.",
