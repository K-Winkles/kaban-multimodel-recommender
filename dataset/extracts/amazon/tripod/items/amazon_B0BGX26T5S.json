Compared it with three other tripods and this one won:Compact, lightweight to fit in a mini backpack.Dont need super long reach. Just enough for a selfie stick, and to not be a low shot for full body tripod photos.Phone adapter easy to remove without much fuss.Complete 360 rotationAble to tilt forward 90 degrees for down shots, AND able to fully rotate the phone holder to tilt 90 degrees backwards. (For front and back camera)Holds phone closer to center point instead of bottom.Has a bottom support for under your phoneAble to tighten phone holder for security and peace of mind.Holds phone on vertical and landscape in CENTER of the stick for max stability.Stable, doesn't wobble.Small tripod circumference.Comes with a Bluetooth remote that has a keychain loop!! (I haven't tested it yet.)Honestly it's almost perfect. I think the only issue is you have to pull pretty hard to open the tripod legs. But that also means that because there's resistance, you won't accidentally catch your fingers when you close them. So I'll take it.As long as nothing breaks I think this is fantastic. I can't wait to use this on my trip, and all future trips!",

Which I can switch between that & my iPhone.So Durable and versatile usage!My only issue was that it didnt come w instructions. And it took a sec or 1000 secs to realize you have to unscrew the orange cap to release the handle into full stand. Yea someone w no patience like me would've broke it eventually. But the common sense of noticing that it loosened from twisting it resolved that sooner than later. TG! Lol. The remote included sometimes connects to pictures on 3rd party apps and sometimes it doesn\u2019t. Ig it was meant for main usage on phones camera. Idk. The app seems outdated for the remote. But It was an extra that im not too concerned about.Other than that small idiotic moment. Decent purchase!",

                "reviewText": "Love it overall out of the package. Have not had real world use yet, but quality of construction gives me confidence. I absolutely love the sleek design of the phone holder that folds down. Looking at the previous reviews I'm a little disappointed that they transitioned over to solid legs versus the flexible ones. I can see it being very useful on unleveled ground. The remote is super easy to use and pairs very quickly to Bluetooth. There are no directions and I wish they would have at least had the pictures that were on here for directions. The phone holder is super sleek and awesome but not exactly intuitive without some directions.I bought the eucos at the same time to compare. It has the exact same feet and telescopic construction. In fact it feels like the exact same product aside from the attachment to hold the phone. Eucos has a screw on phone holder attachment. Secure, but inconvenient to use. The spring that this one has is definitely the way to go. The eucos goes to 62 in instead of this one that goes to 52. Makes me feel like this one could have been that tall as well. It also has a built-in holder for the remote. However when it comes down to it, the slick phone holder, level, ball adjustment wins out.If this was just minor improvements like being a little taller, flexible legs, and remote holder it would be a 6 star product. I like it a lot and will update my review as I use it more and have a better feel for it. At this price, it's worth a shot to try",

I like it very much. Everything I bought it for: lightweight, collapses small enough to fit in my laptop bag. Except I did not get the GoPro adapter as stated on the product page. The description does say it is \"for GoPro Max Hero,\" which sort of implies that I have to have my own, but scroll down and it states that the adapter is included. I don't want to return for an exchange afraid I will just get another without the adapter. For the life of me, I cannot figure out how to contact the seller to tell them it did not come with the part. If it is not supposed to come with the adapter, then the product page is wrong. Love the product though. Wish I knew how to contact the seller.",

                "reviewText": "Ordered this for an upcoming trip as I will be taking photos and videos with both my cell phone and GoPro. Though it\u2019s made of plastic, it feels very solid and the light weight makes it easy to handle. The ball-head makes it very adjustable and the built-in cell phone clamp with cold-shoe on the top and extra cold-shoe on the side provides extra mounting points for accessories such as microphones and lights. There is a bubble-level built-in but it\u2019s placement along the bottom edge of the clamp makes it difficult to see. The spread of the tripod legs is adjustable which is handy for smaller surfaces. Overall, this is a very versatile portable tripod that I am looking forward to try out during my travels.",
