                "reviewText": "A friend recommended this to me and I was a little hesitant but I am so glad that I went through with this purchase. Unlike other stands that I've owned this one isn't at all wobbly.I really love how sturdy it is as it allows me to take videos without worrying about whether the phone is going to make the tripod fall because it's too heavy.Also love that it can be used as a selfie stick eliminating the need for me to have both a selfie stick and a regular tripod stand.This really is the cream of the crop where tripod stands are concerned and I'd 100% recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "This selfie stick/tripod is surprisingly nice. the ability to adjust it up and down without having to unsnap or twist clamps to adjust it is a welcoming surprise. It holds my SAMSUNG A53 inside of a case without any issue. The handle helps keep the camera stable as you are walking. Having four legs vs. three has made a big difference in stability when used as a tripod.Drawbacks/concerns:It's mostly made of ABS plastic. I question the durability if dropped, knocked over or rough handled by users. The hinge on the handle is a weak point so be gentle when using it. I've used it for a week so far and have been pleased with my ability to move it about, retract and expand at will. But durability is one of my biggest concerns. The phone cradle holds my phone more secure than nearly every phone cradle I used except for those with locking mechanisms, although my phone still moves around a little, I don't see it popping or just falling out randomly. Drawback is that is also made of ABS plastic but appears to be well made. The screws that allow the cradle to expand, like every other cradle I've owned, they will likely come loose over time. Hopefully ULANZI used Loctite on the screw threads so this doesn't happen but as soon as it does, I'll be back to update because it doesn't make sense that these factories don't think of this simply fix, or they're hoping it stays secure until after the return period expires and sell you another one. \ud83e\udd14I'm a big fan of and I own a number of products from this manufacturer and all seem to be of great quality. The overall design of this product is very impressive except for the choice of using ABS plastic rather than carbon fiber is questionable, but then again the cost would likely be triple.When collapsed, it is larger than other selfie sticks I've owned, but seems to be more solid and higher quality. I recommend this product for users who are not rough on their gear. Knowing that the weakest parts are made of ABS plastic (handle, tripod legs, phone cradle). Treat this one with love and it will quickly become your favorite. YMMV",

                "reviewText": "This item is *not* your normal selfie stick. It's definitely a bit heavier (and sturdier) while still being somewhat light, and roughly 2 feet longer than the normal one that I also have. I got this one because it gives me more flexibility when using my phone to capture photos and video, as not only does the phone holder section rotate for wide or vertical usage, it also has a built-in cold shoe mount for add-ons like a selfie mirror or external microphone. The remote control easily paired with my phone (Android) for taking photos. You can also switch out the mounting heads, as it comes with a smaller screw base for attaching cameras that need that type of base.I've already taken this stick out on a little hike in my local park, and it worked great. My hands are too unsteady for taking nature photos, so having a good stick with a sturdy tripod to place my phone or regular camera on is necessary, and having the remote control to take photos is a good thing. I will be using this stick a lot in the future.",
