                "reviewText": "Just got off a solo cruise and this was amazing to have. It folds up small and easily fits into my small bag. I could head off the beaten path to find the best spots for some panoramic shots without having to worry about anyone being around to take my photo for me. In the past I\u2019d have to find something to prop my camera against, but with this, I can go anywhere and get any shot I want. I\u2019m going on an international trip soon, and am already excited to take it with me. The remote worked flawlessly. It held charge really well.",

It\u2019s very stable as a tripod, lightweight but rigid when extended as a selfie stick and holds my iPhone 12 tightly. It collapses down easily, is less than a foot long collapsed and looks great. The rechargeable camera remote works well, I couldn\u2019t be happier!",

Excellent value for the price, compact size tripod and sturdy Selfie Stick!This is an excellent product for anyone looking for a compact selfie stick that is sturdier, extends to a 60inch length, and comfortable grip. There is an extremely convenient and detachable Bluetooth remote control that is rechargeable and USB to micro-USB cable provided as part of the contents. The tripod itself is extremely useful for use as a selfie or a phone tripod enthusiast to use a steady, yet light in weight tripod. The holder for placing the phone has quite a lot of tension, so provides a very secure grip to hold a phone, with some padding to not scratch the phone and avoid any slip/slide of phone once secured. A great product and I'm extremely satisfied with the purchase, delivered on time by Amazon as always.",
