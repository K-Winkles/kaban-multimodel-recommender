The tripod is best suited for phone, go-pro, and indoor shoots. This is not meant for DSLRs or any other purpose such as plein air setup, projector mount stand, etc. The remote setup was easy, and it works as desired. Love the on-off switch on the side, the blue light on remote for pairing and the use is pretty straightforward and simple. The tripod setup is very easy and does not require an instruction manual. Just screw the phone mount and you are good to go. It has a pan head to shoot either in portrait or landscape mode. It comes with screw down clamp for the phone mount instead of the clasp, which I absolutely love. I regularly record cooking videos, and have tried various other phone mounts in the past including clasp and retractable styled and they have mostly been annoying or unreliable. This one provides incredible stability. At it's full length the tripod may seem slightly unstable, but as long as you stick to using this for phone and indoor shooting, it will work as intended. Pleased with the purchase. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "For the price, it's a good tripod. Holds the phone firmly, has adjustable legs , and many ways to adjust the angles. It's not very tall though, and it easily tips over if slightly imbalanced, due to it's very light weight nature. For standard photography or gym setups surely good enough, but for anything more professional you'll need something more sturdy and firm.",

                "reviewText": "This tripod is amazingly sturdy for a phone and I love the screw based phone mount rather than those janky spring loaded ones. This one allows you to really tighten down on your device, even has silicone pads to protect the sides of the phone. Quick release to remove the whole mount. and the tube metal is a lot heavier than some of the other ones. So far this is the best investment for a tripod to use for your phone. And the remote (only tested on iphone so far) can snap a pic, or start/stop video. and the bluetooth connect to the phone is fast and simple.",
