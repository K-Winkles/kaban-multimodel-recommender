                "reviewText": "The first thing I noticed about this tripod is its weight. It is travel size and compact; it weights about 13.8oz. This tripod is simple to setup. You push the \"Push\" button at the bottom/base of the tripod and it unlocks or releases the three legs. You then hold the body with one hand and pull upward with the other hand to extend the body. It extends to 52.5 inches. There is a wireless remote attached to the body that you pair with your phone. It also comes with a micro USB cable to charge the remote. For the price, it's not a bad product. Do note, I haven't taken this outdoor, but I suspect on a very windy day that it can get knocked over as it's not heavy and sturdy enough to uphold itself.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this on a whim before our trip to Hawaii to do some vlogging and live streaming out there. I was adamant at first because of the old saying \"you get what you pay for\" . However, when I got there and did some live streaming from the beach on TikTok, these mics sounded nice (my audience confirmed the sound when asked)! I used the wind proof attachment of course and it lessened wind background sound which helped a lot while talking.These mics are compact and easy to use. Simply plug in the remote on the bottom of your phone and pair. That's it. My wife and I used each mic while streaming and could not be any more happier! The mic was also good for recording ASMR things like a waterfall, creeks and beach waves. Usually I use the built in mic on my iPhone but I ended up placing one of the mics on a piece of driftwood with my camera mounted a few feet away and it picked things up nicely.Pleasantly surprised with the quality considering the price. I recommend this if you blog on the go and need a cheap yet quality option!",

I was filling outside and I didn\u2019t have to worry about tipping over as long as I placed it on a moderately flat surface. But, one of the coolest things is how compact you can fold it for transporting, Because of this I was able to just threw it in my bag. It didn\u2019t add much additional weight either. I would highly recommend this stand.",
