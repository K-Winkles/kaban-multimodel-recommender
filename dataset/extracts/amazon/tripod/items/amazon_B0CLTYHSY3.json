                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I recently ordered the Jkoailiwi 51\" Magnetic Selfie Stick Tripod that promises all-in-one convenience for capturing stellar shots and videos. But does this magnetic marvel live up to the hype, or is it just another clunky contraption that will end up gathering dust in your gadget graveyard? I tossed it in my go bag and ventured out to put it through its paces.Armed with my Jkoailiwi stick, I conquered solo selfies with magnetic ease. The remote control added a touch of hands-free freedom, ensuring my poses were always on point. Transforming it into a tripod was a breeze, letting me capture group shots and scenic vistas without relying on shaky friends or precarious balancing acts. Its portability made it a constant companion on hikes and city explorations, always ready to immortalize the moment.Some of the pros and cons of this Jkoailiwi 51\" Magnetic Selfie Stick Tripod are:Pros:Magnetic MojoUnleash the TripodBluetooth BeatsExtendable ReachPortable & PackableCons:Magsafe MusingsPrice Point PonderingLimited Bluetooth RangeThe built-in magnets for Magsafe phones are a game-changer. No more fiddling with clamps or screws; your phone snaps on firmly and detaches with a satisfying click. There are clamps for phones that aren\u2019t Magsafe compatible or for cases that are non-magnetic. Extend the legs and you've got a sturdy tripod for group shots, time-lapses, or hands-free video calls. The included Bluetooth remote lets you trigger shutter releases from afar, eliminating the need for shaky self-timer snaps. Capture wider angles or get closer to the action with the adjustable pole extending up to 51 inches. Travel-friendly convenience, with it being collapsible and lightweight, this stick tucks easily into your bag or backpack, ready to join you on any adventure.While the magnets work wonders with Magsafe phones, non-Magsafe phones require an additional metal ring attachment (included in the box). A minor inconvenience, but worth noting. Compared to basic selfie sticks, the Jkoailiwi comes at a slightly higher cost. The Bluetooth remote's range is decent, but it is not going to reach across vast stadiums or mountain peaks. If you are hoping for something like this, you should adjust your expectations for long-distance triggering.Overall, if you're a smartphone photography enthusiast who craves convenience, versatility, and a touch of magnetic magic, the Jkoailiwi 51\" Magnetic Selfie Stick Tripod is a fantastic choice. The strong magnets, sturdy tripod function, and Bluetooth remote unlock a world of creative possibilities. Just be aware of the need for an additional ring for non-Magsafe phones, the slightly higher price tag, and the limited Bluetooth range. Also be sure to charge up the remote before going out to ensure that you don\u2019t run out of battery when you are trying to get that perfect shot.",

                "reviewText": "I have some of the shakiest hands ever. I got the 40' one and it's a game changer. I love the little remote it comes with which can be removed for tripod use. Folds up smaller than a small umbrella, very convenient!Remote synced so easily. Very stable, even when it's pulled out full height. Seems to be made of good quality materials. I used it a lot over Christmas!I wish there was a way to adjust the angles, when clipped on it only adjusts up/down, doesn't have left/right rotation, when using as a tripod, without moving whole setupAlso, if you have an older bulky case (without magsafe) on your phone and using the pressure clips (about half inch grip on 40\" stick), may have to remove your case. Mine has a very slim Otterbox case w/popsocket on it and it barely holds.The magsafe part works awesomely, if you have that kind of case or built into phone! It does come with everything you need to attach your phone magnetically if you so choose to.Overall a great product & reasonable priced. The 50 inch wasn't available when I got mine, or, tbh, I would have gotten that one.",

This selfie stick is made of a durable plastic and can be used as a mini tripod which come in handy to avoid the \u201cselfie\u201d look in the pics.

                "reviewText": "Ah, the Jkoailiwi 40'' Magnetic Selfie Stick Tripod - the Jack of alle selfie sticks, if Jack was partially made of magnets and mild frustration.**Pros:**Magnet Magic: This stick boasts a magnet strong enough to hold your phone - unless, of course, your phone is going through its non-MagSafe phase. In that case, there's a backup magnet that you can glue on the back of your phone like a technological band-aid.Versatility: It's like a yoga master for phones, bending and twisting into three different positions. Whether you're a portrait, landscape, or 'funky angle' photo enthusiast, this stick's got you covered.Sturdy Extender: The 40\" extension is no joke, and the remote pairs with an iPhone like it was love at first Bluetooth. It's stable and solid, making you feel like a professional photographer, minus the fancy camera and the paycheck.iPhone's Best Friend: If you have a MagSafe iPhone, prepare to be amazed. It's like they were made for each other \u2013 a true technological romance. Unless your phone is wearing a case.**Cons:**Flimsy Attachments: The adjustable clips seem to have taken inspiration from a house of cards. They're about as durable as my patience on a Monday morning.Magnet Woes: The magnet, while a brilliant idea, apparently didn't get the memo about cases. If your phone's dressed in any type of case, you might find yourself resorting to those flimsy clips \u2013 which, spoiler alert, might already be broken off.Battery Blues: The remote runs on a button cell watch battery \u2013 not rechargeable. It's like stepping back into the 90s, but without the cool music and questionable fashion.Design Quirks: You need to extend the arm to access the remote, which feels like solving a puzzle every time. Also, if it's windy, the fully extended arm turns into a weather vane, so you might need to anchor it down like a ship in a storm.**Verdict:**This selfie stick is a neat little gadget with a price tag that makes you think it's made of gold. It's sturdy but has its moments of flimsiness, especially when fully extended. It's like a rollercoaster of emotions \u2013 mostly good, with a hint of \"please don't break.\"If this review helped you in your selfie stick quest or made you chuckle, hit that 'helpful' button. Remember, life's too short for bad selfies. Make it a great day!",
