                "reviewText": "Awesome tripod\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc. I love that it came with a remote, which has worked really with my android phone. A little blue light turns on when u turn it on, but once its connected to your bluetooth, the light turns off. Wish it would stay on just so I can make sure if I do have remote on or off, but it's not that big of a deal. U can easily just turn remote on and off to make sure. When you click to take a picture or click start and stop for video, the blue light does turn on (when you click only. It doesnt stay on). I love that the height is easily adjustable. Also, that phone can easily be placed vertically and horizontally. It's cool also that it came with a Go Pro adapter. I haven't used it cause I don't have a Go pro or anything like that, but it's cool its included\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude01. I like that it can also be used as a selfie stick. U can easily use the remote to take a selfie. I dont think the tripod is flimsy. I think it's pretty sturdy\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc. The price is great too. Plus, I was able to use a $4 coupon on it so it came out even cheaper! My only suggestions to make this item even better are the following: 1) wish backpack bag was just a little taller cause with phone mount it's a little harder to close bag (you can close it but u just have to move the phone mount part to the side). 2) If lanyard or string would come with remote, that would be even more awesome. This is easily solved by putting your own on it (there is a space on remote to insert string/lanyard. I put a string in it), but just saying. 3) it would have been nice if it came with a pouch or if backpack bag came with a pouch to put the remote and other things tripod came with. Again, you can easily get your own pouch and problem is fixed. I used a pouch I already had, but again just saying. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase and the price I paid for it as well\ud83d\ude01.",

                "reviewText": "I am quite the Instagram addict if I say so myself. I love taking pictures of others and it\u2019s great to have someone return the favor. The only problem is that I usually never like the pictures others take of me. It\u2019s always either too much ground or too much sky or they catch me right when I am about to switch my pose. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the phone, my face, or the person\u2019s inability to find good angles. We\u2019ll never know. Anywho\u2026I eventually decided to just start taking pictures for myself. So I invested a few hard earned dollars into this tripod.This is the first tripod that I have owned. I think for the price it is great quality. You can adjust the height considerably. The remote control connects to my phone in a matter of seconds. You literally just turn it on and BOOM! Start clicking away. I love that I don\u2019t have to run back and forth to set a timer for each picture. This allows me to focus on the picture itself to make them more natural. I don\u2019t have to start the timer and then think of a pose. I guess you could say it\u2019s a lot less manual. The one downside is that if you are someone like me that takes at least 300 pictures before picking the 2 good ones, you have to remember to not go crazy with the clicks. Give it time so the pictures are clear. Otherwise they\u2019ll turn out all blurry. Take your time with the shoots. Also, because the remote is very small, it can get lost easily. Try to keep in the same place so it doesn\u2019t get lost.The tripod is relatively compact. I carry it in a tote bag and it fits well. It\u2019s super light weight. When it\u2019s get\u2019s windy, it can get flimsy, swaying back and forth and even fall. Always set it on a flat surface to prevent phone damage.Overall, a great product for recording videos, taking group pictures or taking solos when you see an aesthetic location and decide to pull over. Allows you to enjoy the moment without focusing too much on capturing it :)",

                "reviewText": "This fits really well onto my iPhone 12 with a case and doesn\u2019t fidget while its clasped, making it stay in place. The base has rubber feet that allows it to be non slip and I love the fact that I can adjust the size of how wide the base should be with a simple twist of the screw clasp. This is a great feature as I can literally place it on any surface big or small and it will sit neatly on it.The stick has a neat clasp system where I can adjust the height of the stick upto my eye level almost (I\u2019m 5,11), by clasping and unclasping the 4 levers. The phone can either be held vertically or horizontally and it can even move 360 degrees while clasped on which is a great feature. The stick itself feels nice and sturdy and the materials used seem good quality - doesn't feel like those cheap ones that might break if you handle them too rough. It also comes with a bluetooth remote to take pictures from a distance. Great product at a great price.",

But wouldn't buy it ever again the water spills all around so be prepared to have a wet night stand if you put it there ... Not well fabricated at all. It needs improving, but to be honest it doesn't surprise me with the price of it.",
