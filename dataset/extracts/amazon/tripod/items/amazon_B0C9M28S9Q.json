I wasn't able to give it all five stars because the clamp fingers aren't long enough to hold the phone stable if there is a pop-socket or deep case. My S22 has a case for credit cards as well as a finger catch and it is right on the verge of being too deep for the spring loaded clamp. It stills works good as I primarily use it for filming sports and I keep it fairly protected.The clasps that hold the pole extended are fantastic. No thumb turn screws, a simple pull and push clip. They hold great and are easy enough for young kids to use.The base is fantastic. It can be wide or narrow, warning, it does have a twist lock. It doesn't take much to hold it in place, and has wide ergonomic flares for grip.I've never used a selfie stick, so I can't wait for the next road trip.This collapses so small and can be packed almost anywhere.",

Slender, not difficult to use.The phone holder is a bit clunky and imprecise, I was frustrated with it after a few uses but got accustomed to it. The bottom legs seem to have trouble staying in place, even when tightened, but I generally only have this in a single spot so it is not too much of a problem.So again, it is a great tripod for the value.",
