                "reviewText": "The tripod is compact, lightweight and will do the job I purchased it for. My only mark-down to the rating would be for stability. Once the head is extended to it's extreme height, the tube it rests on wobbles in it's base. The solution for me is to not extend the tube and just try and use the legs to get the height I want. The included bluetooth shutter works without fault. It was easy to pair with the phone camera. Overall, this purchase was beneficial.",

                "reviewText": "Perfect package for the money.Very light weight, but is satisfactory for mobile phones. My S22 Ultra fits the spring loaded holder and pivots perfectly. Instructions for the remote do not tell you to slide (on) the little square button on the side. A blue LED will start to blink once per second and you will find the remote ID in your bluetooth scan list as AB Shutter3 (or similar). Once paired, sliding the button back turns off the remote. Turning it back on keeps the phone pairing. Open camera app on phone, push the remote button, and it takes a picture. Very cool.",
