Has a lot of adjustments at both the base as well as the angle of your camera. Just a couple of turns and you\u2019re set to go. That being said there is a good amount of weight to it so if you want something plastic that weighs nearly nothing this is not the oneI mounted my camera and let it run overnight to capture a Timelapse in the middle of some high wind gusts and it held up perfectly.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this tripod for recording videos, and I have been extremely impressed with its performance. Neewer is a brand I had heard about before and trust.The design of the tripod is both sturdy and lightweight, making it easy to move around and set up. 77 inches is as much as you will need for basically any situation, since you want it to be at least as tall as the person you are filming.One of the standout features of this tripod is the fluid head with adjustable resistance. This allows me to make smooth, precise movements while filming, and the adjustable resistance allows me to customize the amount of resistance to my liking.Another great feature of this tripod is the ability to hang a counterweight from the center column. This provides additional stability and ensures that the tripod doesn't tip over, even when using heavy cameras on an incline.In addition to its impressive features, the tripod also comes with an excellent carrying case.One of the things that surprised me the most about this tripod is its ability to easily convert into a monopod. This is a great feature to have, as it allows me to switch between using the tripod and monopod quickly and easily.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of this tripod. It has way more features than I expected for the price, and it has proven to be a valuable tool for recording videos. I highly recommend this tripod to anyone in need of a sturdy, reliable, and versatile tripod for their filming needs.",

                "reviewText": "This is my 3rd tripod of this brand but this time I was presented with a great price on the Aluminum one. I have had the carbon fiber ones and worn them out with near daily use. I actually bought this one to swap out some parts to keep to old carbon fiber tripods in action and it worked but with some improvements. I like the center tube extension. I like the leg levers instead of the old twist locks. Also the little red leavers at the top of the legs are hooked over making them less jagged. Now the aluminum one is a still light but not as light as the carbon fiber one. Carbon fiber also dampens vibrations which is a bonus for a camera tripod which makes the aluminum one boat as great... but it is still a solid tripod. The ball head is not perfect but it locks in enough to handle modest sized jobs. I think if you expect more than what this tripod offers go to the carbon fiber one. Then the next step up would be no less than a tripod costing more than 2 times The amount of this one.",

It also spins nicely and smoothly with everything tightened and not moving the tripod - with the 360 swivel.
