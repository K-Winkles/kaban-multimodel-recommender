                "reviewText": "The article although it fulfills the function of holding the phone, it has no stability when placing the phone and no matter how much adjustments so that it is a little inclined, it still falls. I had to bend the legs because being the way it came and opening the legs also lost stability and the phone was moving forward. On the other hand, he had a small problem perhaps from the factory, which is as if he wanted to break on the back of the product but so far it has not broken. I'm writing this review after I've used it for about two weeks. I repeat, I could get better. If you are looking for something better, in fact you will have to invest a little more. And I almost forgot the stand where the phone goes usually stays open, that is, it does not return to its normal position (maybe the internal springs were not good)",
