It's great in nearly every aspect.Unfortunately, for my use of holding my phone... It's not perfect. To have your phone in portrait for scrolling and what not you have to use the notch in the part holding the ball. No problem really, but in that orientation the tripod is unstable, because the phone part flipps outward. You can bend the legs to counteract this. My next issue is that the part that flipps out, to hold the cell phone isn't very secure. My phone has come out multiple times while taking photos on hikes. I absolutely do not trust it to hold my phone if were moving around a lot. Like on a bike or out a moving car window. You also can't change out the part that holds your phone for something more secure.I do not have a proper camera so I can't say how secure that aspect is.",

                "reviewText": "With a desktop Mac, such as the Mac Mini, or Mac Studio, it is great to be able to use your iPhone as a camera for web meetings. Apple calls this \"Continuity Camera\", and there are various holders made for using your iPhone in the manner. The problem is that they clip on top of your monitor.I was looking for a holder, or stand, that allows my iPhone to sit on my desk, at a height equal to my face, rather than perched on top of a large monitor and looking down from above. The UBeesize flexible tripod fit the bill, and works perfectly for that purpose. The flexible legs, and adjustable ball-joint, allow for positioning the phone in any manner desired. Fits my need perfectly, and I can easily recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "What a pleasant surprise to receive this Ubeesize tripod. I do not know where to begin - so many features that are CLEARLY superior to the better-known \u201cJxxx\u201d brand!!I ordered a Joby - direct from them - and it was junk compared to this item.When dealing with that other outfit - I ended up dealing with FIVE different companies - to return it - marketing, product support, fulfilment, warranty, return - ALL different companies!! (Still waiting for my credit for the one I tried - and returned.)I should have known - when I saw the weight - of the competitive model... I find this Ubeesize to be the right weight - for ME. It is almost double what a similar sized name-brand model weighs - but THIS ONE IS ROBUST!! If featherweight is your main goal - this may not be for you. But if you want something that looks like it will last years in everyday abuse - - this might be for you.I ordered this quickly - did not read the features properly - thought it might be foolish - since I was so unhappy with a known-competitors similar costing MUCH MORE! I was pleasantly surprised to see that this, is the way I want to go! - The legs are firmly attached to the mounting point - not feeling like they are about to fall off! (COMMON on most competitors) - The mounting assembly - which holds my phone - while in it\u2019s case - AND is also suitable for 1/4\u201d mount cameras - is simply ingenious - VERY clever. (I initially thought I had ordered the wrong SKU - - seeing the 1/4\u201d mount only. Men don\u2019t read instructions so I fiddled with it and it flipped open to reveal a robust and SMART design that allows it to be used for all sorts of devices.) - the optional mounting accessories are handy - for use with GoPro and such. Neat! - 3 year warranty?? - - BONUS!My ONLY gripe - is the Bluetooth remote... I love it but it won\u2019t work.That too - is vastly superior to the one that came with the Joby model. Again - this one is robust and I would put it on my keychain, (competitors has a piece of thread to attach to your key ring...)It does indicate that the remote may NOT work with some models of phones... I have a Pixel P3 and the remote will connect to the camera - but activates the ZOOM feature instead of activating the shutter. Close - but no cigar. (And I did also try the recommended app - with the same result).Does anyone have a fix for that? I would really like to be able to control my P3 when mounted on this fine tripod remotely.But I am STILL giving this device a 5 star rating.SO VASTLY SUPERIOR TO THE NAME-BRAND, in every way - in My Opinion.Oh yeah - - and at just more than HALF THE PRICE OF THE NAME-BRAND... Sort of a no-brainer!",
