                "reviewText": "I recently ordered the Geekoto 81\u201d Monopod Aluminum Travel Tripod prior to going on a hiking trip up to the Rockies. I am new to shooting landscapes, but I really loved this tripod.The price was fantastic for the weight. I was able to attach this to my camera backpack without too much difficulty and could take it out quickly to setup for beautiful pictures.Opening the Amazon box, there was a smaller, black and orange Victiv box that had a bag inside with an adjustable strap. The tripod was folded up very compactly and even had a small, soft, reusable \"velvet\" bag along with some components. The tripod was very self-explanatory and was easily unfolded and extended to full height. The rubber leg caps were easy to lose, thus I would suggest in the future using a strap to connect these to the feet of the tripod.The bright orange mount is made entirely of metal and is just hefty enough to provide solid support. Easy to adjust angles with full 360-degree rotation. and had a bubble level to help. I would absolutely recommend this tripod to anyone seeking an affordable, compact camera tripod. The customer service was also excellent, as I had broken off a piece of the clip when trying to move quickly, they immediately sent me a replacement product without a question. I look forward to taking this on many future trips!",

                "reviewText": "Update: 5/5 Without me ever reaching out, the seller sent a message within 24 hours of my review posting explaining a bit more about the product, including the fact that the plastic leg clamps are covered by a 10 year warranty. This type of customer support is amazing. The seller initiated a full refund and said I could keep the item, encouraging me to provide more feedback in the future as I continue to use the product.Original: 3/5 Stars. I got this tripod so that I could take better photos while traveling and hiking. Overall, I love this tripod!Pros:Versatile - This tripod is like a spider, I was able to use it on steep hills and at very awkward angles to get the photo I wanted.Sturdy - The product is made out of a durable metal that I wasn't worried about breaking.Cons:The leg- locking mechanisms are plastic and seem like the most likely thing to break.The product is not lightweight.As I opened the product, the level from the top knob of the ball head fell off. Seems like it was just missing glue but was definitely worrying.My biggest concern is the mounting mechanism that joins the ball head to the tripod itself. The smaller knob intended for horizontal rotation does not seem to loosen anything up, so I have to turn the entire orange piece if I need it to be pointed in the right direction. This often ends up loosening it's attachment to the tripod. I wish that there was a way to lock the orange piece onto the tripod in addition to the screw mechanism.Inside of my package was a piece of paper saying that in exchange for a review they will send a $30 Amazon gift card. With this in mind, the tripod enters a low to mid range price point and excells within that category.",

                "reviewText": "I haven't taken this tripod out in the field yet, but the parts all seem to be well machined and it's the most versatile tripod I've ever owned. It's pretty easy to convert it to a monopod or turn the center column upside down without tools. The ball head is well constructed and the quick release plate seems sturdy compared to other QR tripods I've used. Removing it requires lifting it straight up off the base. It came with 3 hex wrenches to tighten up the legs if they get loose.The instructions were very rudimentary, and I ended up taking off the wrong part of the center column when I first started playing with it. If you do that too, there are 2 plastic guide pieces that go on the column and fit only 1 way around a guide groove inside the tube, so it can be a little tricky to reassemble. In monopod mode, the padded handle is lower on the monopod than I'd like, but it's probably good if you use the monopod to shoot over a crowd. Besides the 3 hex wrenches (it would be nice if 1 wrench could fit all of the screws) included, there is a short center pole and a double ended screw for using it instead of the large center pole that comes preinstalled. There are no instructions at all about how to use those parts, and the case doesn't really have a secure place to keep them. I reinforced the bottom of the ziploc bag that came with the parts with duct tape (it was already torn in transit, but I'd recommend reinforcing it anyway if you plan to use it for storing the parts) and fit the bag with the wrenches, center pole, screw, and instructions in the bottom of the case and was still able to squeeze the tripod in. It also comes with a drawstring protective bag for the ball head, which is a nice touch.Overall this seems like a nice quality tripod for the price. I took off 1 star for the poor instructions and lack of storage for the loose parts. It's also fairly heavy as tripods go, but that weight goes towards making it more sturdy and stable that it otherwise might be.",

                "reviewText": "This is such a great and high-quality tripod! It is exceptionally well-made, has dual-level bubbles, becomes a monopod, and even has foam grips on the legs for different shooting methods. I bought one for home and three for work. The case is well-made and stands up to the abuse. I also appreciate the second mounting bracket and the accessories, including a phone holder. The phone holder is big enough to accommodate my case and even can slide a light in on the top. I highly recommend this tripod!",
