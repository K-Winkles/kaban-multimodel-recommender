                "reviewText": "I was looking to upgrade my tripod for quite some time now and planned to order this one and use. I must admit I am happy with my decision. Below are the details:1. The snap locking mechanism in this tripod is really useful and you can adjust the height comfortably based on the available surface. Also, there are 3 different levels to lock the angle of the legs of this tripod (See attached photo). Just that these angle snappers are of okay quality but should work as long as used with care.2. Build quality is good and this one sturdy. Can be used in winds and has a hook below the central pipe to add some weight to keep the tripod steady.3. Height - The height of this tripod is really good, specially when compared with my old tripod which was a 3.5 ft portable one. This one is tall and can be adjusted at different levels yet is not very heavy to carry around.4. The panoramic ball head is very useful if you like to click timelapses or panorama shots.5. This tripod comes with a good quality bag and a separate cover for the head mount to avoid any scratches on the tripod legs when folded. There is also a tool to tighten the screws if any become loose.6. The color scheme is subtle and it\u2019s a good-looking, portable product.Overall I\u2019d say the build quality is not like that of the carbon fibre tripods but really good given the price it comes at and the accessories it comes with. I\u2019ve used it for about a month now and will update the review if I find something new over time.",

                "reviewText": "First of all, the product seems to be a decent entry level tripod. It's sufficiently sturdy and adjustable. Calling this a professional tripod however is a stretch. But once again, I am baffled that it seems to be so difficult to write usable instructions for a product. To be fair, my Chinese is pretty bad, but I wouldn't make an attempt to write product instructions for use in China. I would hire someone who speaks and writes Chinese to do so. K&F should take heed and do the same for instructions written in English.Some of the instructions are downright incorrect. For example, when it comes to locking the legs is says, \"the locking knob clockwise rotate 1/4 to 1/2 circle...\" the problem is, this tripod uses levers to lock the legs not knobs. So this \"Feet pipe extension\" step is completely wrong for this model.Then there is this sentence which I still have no idea what it means. \"Do not away form the people when use in the public area.\" And the ever important \"Please operate carefully in the dangerous places.\"Finally, they have invented a new term \"anti-folded\". I thought this meant the same as \"unfolded\" but I now think it means to fold the legs up rather than down. Not exactly sure though as this is not a term you normally see associated with a tripod.When you manufacture and sell tens of thousands of tripods it seems like a very small effort to come up with a readable instruction sheet in the language where your product is marketed.",

                "reviewText": "At this price point I was unsure of the quality of the tripod but I can say that the K&H concept is an amazing tripod for photography.Here are my pros and cons for this piece of equipment:Pros:- Snap locking legs are the way to go; don't waste your time with twist-to-lock legs. I have been able to set up and take a full panorama picture with my K&F Concept before some friends with twist locking leg tripods have been able to set up and pull off a single shot. It's easy and fast to make any minor adjustments and never slips once tightened.- Rock solid even in winds. Although weight may seem like an initial con, the fact is that this tripod is light enough to carry with you yet heavy enough to sustain moderate to somewhat heavy winds for long exposures. If in extreme heavy winds the tripod includes a mounting hook for sandbags or any weight (including hanging your camera bag).- Fits perfectly with my (also purchased) Peak Design Everyday Messenger Bag. https://www.peakdesign.com/everyday-messenger The padded leg of the tripod acts as extra protection for my gear when I slide the tripod into my camera bag. This extra detail has led me to bring this tripod with me more than any other tripod.- The amazing ball head. With the built-in level the K&F Concept ball head is worth the price of admission. It is light yet extremely durable and can handle some pretty intense weight (Nikon d500 with battery pack and 18-35mm in portrait mode)Cons:- Unless mounted with the leveling head facing away from the lens the ball head has some trouble reaching full portrait orientation without changing the heights of the legs. However, the snap locking legs make those adjustments easy to make.Customer Service:Immediate and thorough.Conclusion:At this price point the K&F Concept is the tripod to go for. It\u2019s value is amazing and the support team is fast and reliable. I can\u2019t recommend this enough for newcomers or professionals looking to add a versatile yet affordable piece of kit to their collection. Well done K&H!",

La testa a sfera \u00e8 di ottima fattura: ha tre manopole per regolare panning, rotazione della sfera e per stringere la quick-release plate, da avvitare al corpo macchina.\u00c8 dotato di livella a bolla, gancio per appendere un peso (lo zaino ad esempio) e aumentare la stabilit\u00e0, parte centrale invertibile (per poter scattare foto ad altezza suolo).La presenza di tutte queste caratteristiche (molto utili, soprattutto il gancio) e la buona qualit\u00e0 costruttiva (utilizzato a 0 gradi e con vento molto forte, si \u00e8 comportato molto bene, anche se ho dovuto estendere solo due sezioni su tre per aumentare la stabilit\u00e0) lo rendono un treppiede molto appetibile.Ora i difetti:Il panning, pur essendo fluido, \u00e8 \"duro\" e si rischia di svitare l'intera testa anzich\u00e9 ruotarla come dovrebbe. Consiglio di stringere la testa il pi\u00f9 possibile.Al prezzo a cui viene venduto \u00e8 difficile chiedere di pi\u00f9. Sono molto soddisfatto dell'acquisto anche se bisogna accettare il fatto che non si tratta di un oggetto professionale.

Cambio il voto da 4 a 5 stelle, questo treppiede \u00e8 un ottimo acquisto.",

                "reviewText": "Petit tr\u00e9pied de la marque K&F Concept.Premi\u00e8rement, on re\u00e7oit le tr\u00e9pied dans sa sacoche de rangement. Le sac mesure 50cm de long. A priori, il a l\u2019air de bonne qualit\u00e9 et en plus le fond est renforc\u00e9, assez \u00e9pais pour pr\u00e9venir des chocs. On peut le porter avec les petites poign\u00e9es ou alors on peut l\u2019\u00e9quiper de la bandouli\u00e8re. Il y a \u00e9galement un petit sac en velours qui est fourni.Au niveau des dimensions, quand il est repli\u00e9, t\u00eate vers le bas, il fait 47cm. Sinon quand il est pli\u00e9 mais cette fois-ci t\u00eate vers le haut, il fait 60cm.C\u00f4t\u00e9 poids, il p\u00e8se, 1kg 280g sur ma balance.Les tubes, les branches sont en alliage d\u2019alluminium avec du magn\u00e9sium, ce qui est cens\u00e9 rendre la mati\u00e8re r\u00e9sistante \u00e0 la corrosion et \u00e0 l\u2019abrasion.Sur une des branches, on a une petite \u00e9ponge antid\u00e9rapante, ce qui est plut\u00f4t confortable \u00e0 manipuler et c\u2019est vrai, en ext\u00e9rieur, le m\u00e9tal peut \u00eatre tr\u00e8s froid, et l\u00e0, du coup, on va pouvoir le porter \u00e0 cet endroit.Au niveau de l'utilisation, c'est assez simple. En haut de chaque branche, on a l\u2019ajustement de l\u2019angle. Donc il y a trois positions.Vous pouvez \u00e9galement retourner la colonne pour faire une prise de vue au ras du sol, de la macro. Il faut juste d\u00e9visser le petit crochet avec le caoutchouc. On sort la colonne, et on la remonte \u00e0 l\u2019envers.Il y a \u00e9galement un petit crochet de support pour lester le tr\u00e9pied.Au niveau de la hauteur maximum, quand les 3 sections sont \u00e9tendues et qu\u2019il est r\u00e9gl\u00e9 sur la premiere position, avec l\u2019angle le plus r\u00e9duit, le tr\u00e9pied s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve, du sol au sommet de la t\u00eate fluide, \u00e0 159cm.C\u00f4t\u00e9 rotule, il y a deux serrages de direction. Le premier concerne la rotation panoramique. D\u2019ailleurs il y a une \u00e9chelle de valeur. Donc \u00e7a peut \u00eatre des rep\u00e8res, pour faire par exemple une photo panoramique.Egalement quand il est desser\u00e9, on a un effet de friction de r\u00e9sistance. Donc \u00e7a peut permettre \u00e9galement en vid\u00e9o de faire des mouvements panoramiques assez fluides.Ensuite, le deuxi\u00e8me serrage au dessus, contr\u00f4le la rotule et on a \u00e9galement la petite encoche pour le mode portrait \u00e0 90\u00b0; \u00e7a fait toujours plaisir.Et puis au-dessus, classique, on a le plateau rapide. Il faut d\u00e9visser pour le lib\u00e9rer. Egalement il y a la petite aide de serrage, c'est bien pratique. Ca \u00e9vite d\u2019utiliser une pi\u00e8ce ou d\u2019abimer son pouce.Et puis, il y aussi le petit niveau \u00e0 bulle.Si la rotule ne vous plait pas, vous pouvez la remplacer. On peut la d\u00e9visser. On a ensuite une vis 3/8\u2019\u2019, et puis l\u00e0, on peut y monter une nouvelle rotule.Ca fait maintenant quelques mois que je l'utilise pour la photo et la vid\u00e9o. Pour l'instant aucun souci en particulier. Un bon petit tr\u00e9pied, pour un premier achat. Je recommande.Je tiendrai ce commentaire \u00e0 jour, si des probl\u00e8mes viennent \u00e0 apparaitre.Si vous avez jug\u00e9 ce commentaire utile, merci de cliquer sur oui, vous me ferez plaisir :)",

                "reviewText": "Bought this as a travel tripod to take anywhere in the car, as my old one was a big heavy beast... thought for the money, you cant really go wrong. The price point is very good.So when it arrived I thought Id give it a test. On opening the box, I saw a lovely, strong carry bag with sturdy zip. It felt a nice weight. not too heavy to carry places. Inside was a nice looking tripod with some nice detailing to make it look modern and more expensive than it was. The head even had another bag over to protect it, which I thought was a nice touch. It had 4 section clip-lock legs and rubber feet, with a height adjustable centre column with a weight hook underneath for added stability.To test it I used my heaviest camera and lens combo on it, and it held them pretty strong, after giving the tightener on the head a good twist. It needed doing up pretty tight but it held a 5d mk 3, with battery grip and 70-200 with no problem. I tried it from the camera body just to see, but it felt much sturdier mounting it to the lens collar, but thats what its there for.I did a couple of tests in low light with exposures of 5 seconds, and they seemed pretty sharp so the tripod was doing its job well. I did have a bit of weight hanging from the hook under the centre column, purely because my camera and lens were so heavy, but id always recommend doing that anyway.Fully extended I found this tripod to be a great size. Im 5'10 and I couldnt reach my eye to the viewfinder at full height so it would easily suit the taller photographer. As with any tripod, it operate best slightly under full height. The centre column and lower part of the legs can introduce shake, so I would only extend those if necessary, but they arent weak by any means.My overall impressions are that this is a great entry level tripod for those looking for something light, strong, and good value for money. Id definitely recommend it. I tried it with a 6d mk 2 and 24-105 too, and with that combo it was a dream, but I like to test things to the extreme before reviewing.",
