The quality on this tripod is actually way better than what I expected and comes in handy when i most need it! The stand at max height isn't all wobbly like other tripods and the selfie stick itself isn't wonky when at max length either. I've had other tripods as I like to film content and this tripod by far has proven itself at the price point. If you're skeptical about trying this tripod out then don't be. Take it from someone who's gone through like five other tripods I've gotten from Amazon. I'd rate this at maybe a solid 9.5/10. Only reason it isn't a 10/10 is because I didn't find this tripod any sooner lol!",

I would like it to be and I was wishing that it's the leg was not that's wide because I'd like to travel with it and I don't want it to be too cumbersome.
