                "reviewText": "It's really not the most stable tripod in the world when the legs are extended fully, but it's really not bad for what you pay for. The legs extend quite a ways giving you a lot of height range to play with. Plus it has a handy bubble level at the top of the tripod to help you get everything level in your shot. It folds down and fits in a nice (included) bag that won't take up much room in your pack. This is just what I was looking for. It may struggle with a really heavy camera mounted to it, but for holding a phone it's perfect. I was able to pair the remote easily. Push a button on the remote and it will take a picture, or use the button to start/stop video recording. Really not a bad product for the price.",

                "reviewText": "It seems like it's hard to find a good place to prop up a smart phone for a group pic. You simply need a stand/tri-pod to do it right! This is a great Tri-Pod system for a smart phone. Actually the tri-pod will work with any point-shoot camera, or others if the camera is not too large/heavy. Included are tripod, smart phone mount, Bluetooth shutter control button, and carry case. Using the control button with camera set on 3 sec delay it works great for group pics as the 3 secs give you time to hide the button/hand. The shutter button can of course be used without the tripod on any camera with a Bluetooth feature. I like this tri-pod \u2018cause it\u2019s small and will easily fit in my Harley saddle bag. very good quality and a very reasonable price!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent quality for the price - great starter tripod!",
                "reviewText": "Bought this tripod as a simple stand for recording videos and taking group photos. Other reviews had positive things to say, but once I actually got my hands on it I was very impressed. It's not the mot sophisticated tripod, but I'm really pleased and surprised with how great the quality is for the price.PROS: Easy to assemble the tripod itself and to get it prepared for photos. I only have a smartphone so I can't weigh in on how it does with digital cameras. As far as smartphones go, it was a breeze to set it up to hold my phone. I have an iPhone 7 Plus and the clamp fit it very well without a case on it. The legs are also easy to extend up and down and they twist into place so you don't have to worry about a leg collapsing and damaging any equipment it's holding. Also, the Bluetooth shutter button that comes with it was one of the easiest Bluetooth syncs I've ever experienced. If you follow the included instructions for syncing, it only takes a moment to get it set up. The shutter button works for not only photos, but also to start and stop video recording.CONS: My only complaint is that I have a protective case on my phone that i had to remove because it was too tight with it on. It makes me a little nervous to set my phone on a tripod without the case, but from what I understand that's pretty common for smartphone tripods. I'll also note that the legs are sturdy when holding a phone and would probably support a simple digital camera, but it's possible they might be a bit unstable for a very heavy camera, though it's hard to say for sure.",

When it was delivered, I found that it was actually too large for that. shame, because it is more sturdy than the ones that actually work. Then I found that I can mount my video projector on it. No more looking for something about the right height. Set it up, turn on the video, and enjoy.At night, I can set it up outside, pointed at the building across the yard, and I have a 20 foot wide television for far less money than a 50 inch screen.",

                "reviewText": "It's cheap, and using it you understand why. It works fine, but I can tell after having it fully extended for a while, the legs want to bow slightly. Nothing terrible, but throwing that out there. The legs lock in place by having those little metal nodes pop out and hold the leg in place, and I can imagine after some use, that may become less dependable. But for now, it's fine. The contraption to hold your phone is handy. It holds on tight, and more so the bigger your phone is since it has a spring to hold it together. I have it hold the lower part of my Pixel 2. I know it has a squeeze function to it, but it doesn't seem to cause it any trouble. (Internally I scream though because I hate it holding on so tight.) I should've measured how it would be. It sits around waist height for me, so to not having it looking up at me at probably the worst angle, I'll need to set it on something. Otherwise, I like it. The bluetooth control is real handy as well.",

                "reviewText": "I've had my Fotopro Phone Tripod Stand for over 2 years now. I use it extensively to workout with my trainer (virtually) 2-3 times a week, and record videos outdoor sometimes. It's light, can be extended to provide a great viewing angle, and support large phones.The tripod is light enough that I can carry around in string/gym bag and golf bag. The 3 legs provide great stability indoor and also on the grass outdoor. Soccer fields and golf courses are where I've taken mine to before. On the golf course, it has no issue withstanding low-mid wind.The height can be adjusted so that you could film from the ground level (around a foot from the ground) and all the way to the body level. My personal trainer also mentioned that it got tall enough to provide a full body angle when extended fully, and can see my whole body when placing it 4-5 ft away. It's great when there's little space in your gym.It can also hold large phones. I have an iPhone 11 Max, and have no issue with it. But you might have to take your case out (depending on how thick your case is). The lock that prevents your phone from rotating is probably the only unintuitive feature of this tripod, but it didn't take me long to figure it out. Once in a while it might become loose, and you'll have to tighten it up. Just play with it when you open the box, and you'll be fine.Overall, spending less than $30 for a tripod that I use multiple times a week for over 2 years is definitely money well spent!",
