Using it as a tripod and not having to ask strangers to take a picture of us alone was worth the cost. My iPhone 12 Mini and my daughter's iPhone 14 snap onto it very securely. As a result of such a secure connection, I did things with this selfie stick that I would have never imagined doing. Any force that would remove the phone under normal use would likely be enough to break the selfie stick itself. The Magsafe connection is really solid. For people like myself with neurological issues (hand strength and control) it can be a little hard getting the phone off of the mount but I would rather wrestle with it a little than risk losing an expensive phone. It is very quick to adjust the phone mount angle and stick length but deploying the legs of the tripod takes a little getting used to, for me at least with my hand strength/control issues. We took some amazing pictures and were able to get angles that would be impossible without it. The remote snaps on and off fairly easily and quickly and works well out to about 30' away from my phone when there is nothing between the remote and the phone. At closer distances it worked fine even when the remote was hidden behind me but not near the maximum range. Greater range for the remote would be great but at this price point I am not sure that is a realistic expectation. I used it in tripod configuration in fairly high winds and it was surprisingly stable. The entire unit is small enough to fit in a flight tote and fairly lightweight. I think when taken care of it would last a really long time. It pairs by Bluetooth easily (it shows up as 'O-Mag') and uses 1632 batteries. I used the remote for hundreds of pictures and the original battery still has some life in it. It would be a god idea to have a spare around though, just in case. At this price point I do not think you could do better than this selfie stick. It was worth every penny and I would certainly recommend it for anyone on a budget who wants to elevate their phone photography game.",

However, it was easy to attach the ring to the cover of my Android phone the stick could hold it.The suction cup seems like it can hold a phone well enough on its own, but the magnetic ensures that your device isn't going anywhere. This stick is very sturdy, and you would have to put some effort into it if you wanted to break it.It gets tall enough to take group pictures, and the Bluetooth remote works well without any problems, although it does take a few seconds to connect.This is the best selfie stick/tripod I've ever used or seen, and I really like it.",

Let me tell you, this stand holds up my phone perfectly with no movement whatsoever. To test it out even more, I tried putting my iPad Pro and I got the same result; no movement. I love this stand so much I bought more for my family. If you're looking for a sign: just buy it.",
