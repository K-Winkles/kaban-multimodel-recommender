I have a Sony a 7C, which isn\u2019t too heavy when I use my tiny prime lens I have, but when I shoot vertical videos which involves flipping the camera over the tripod struggles to stay balanced, and I have to have something weighing down one of the legs down. This is especially the case when I have a light and microphone attached to the camera. I like though that you can have full control to move the camera at any angle you may need. I think that the Sony brand mini tripod doesn\u2019t have full flexibility and for the price it just didn\u2019t seem worth it to me which is why I ended up buying this one.This is pretty easy to open up and close the legs. I can easily hold the tripod to film when the legs are closed together.",
