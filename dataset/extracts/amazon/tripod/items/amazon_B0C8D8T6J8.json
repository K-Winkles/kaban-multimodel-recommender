So you can turn your phone so that the higher resolution cameras are on your face. Just put a mirror behind so you can make sure that the picture is good because it\u2019s the little camera on the device that\u2019s tracking your face.That was like the most important thing to know for me because I thought like a gimbal was going to connect through the phone and it does it. It uses that one device camera not the one on your phone.The device camera is not recording you it is tracking your face. And if you have a longer face, if you raise your eyebrow, it will actually move to where you moved your eyebrow.If you have an Apple Watch, you could use your Apple Watch to make sure the picture is good otherwise it is gonna take a little bit of finagling to make sure the picture is good. If you use your rear cameras, that\u2019s what I would say the biggest downfall of this device is.",

                "reviewText": "I had my doubts about this device. They say it tracks your face and it does actually track very well. It only tracks in the horizontal plane so you do need to align it vertically.Once you set it up though, it follows you really well with just a slight delay when you change directions. You could use this for a video chat and not be locked to one spot or you could use it for content creation like Youtube to track you as you move around in your home/kitchen, whatever you're doing. The tracking is a bit \"notchy\". It's not a continuous flow track, you move, it moves and stops. Then if you move again, it starts moving. It doesn't speed up or slow down or track continuously like the \"eagle eye\" in expensive gimbals.There is a remote to turn the unit on/off and to start/stop the tracking and also recording function if you pair to your phone with bluetooth.The base has a slightly larger footprint than the body though it could be a little wider, it was a bit tippy if the phone wasn't mounted in the center.Battery life seemed good, a single charge gave me at least 30 minutes of tracking and still it had more battery time.",
