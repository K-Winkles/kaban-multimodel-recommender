                "reviewText": "I just love this little tripod. I have several that I use with my GoPro cameras. Most are cheaply made of plastic and don't feel very sturdy in the hand. This one is well made, with sturdy materials, feels solid in the hand and looks like it will last for years with heavy use. Folded up it works great as a hand mount. Then it's very easy to deploy and set on the ground or a nearby table or rock to capture video. I shoot a lot of content in the outdoors on 4X4 trips. I will typically hike up the trail as vehicles are working their way through technical terrain. I keep my Nikon mirrorless camera on my strap to shoot stills while also filming with a GoPro to get video at the same time. This little tripod makes it quick and easy to set the GoPro up so it can keep rolling while I step away to shoot from a different angle. It's a handy thing to have in your kit.",

The adjustable height is a handy feature, with two levels to choose from. Plus, it's a universal fit for both iPhones and Androids, along with compact cameras.One cool perk is the Bluetooth remote that comes with it, making it a breeze to capture those group shots or solo adventures. It's even got your back if you're rocking a DSLR or micro four-thirds camera, handling up to 44 pounds like a pro.Now, let's talk downsides\u2014the leg angles aren't adjustable, which might limit your angles a bit. Also, due to its small size, it's not as rock-steady as those big tripods out there.But here's the verdict: If you're all about portability and versatility, the K&F Concept MS05 Mini Metal Tripod is a solid choice. It pulls double duty as a mini tabletop tripod and a trusty handheld stabilizer. For the price, it's a smart investment for your camera gear. Whether you're a vlogger or just love getting up close and personal with your shots, this little guy has your back. \ud83d\udcf8\ud83d\udc4d",

                "reviewText": "I picked up the 13CM version of this stand to use with the K&F Selfie Stick (MS07) primarily as a mini-monopod with an OSMO Pocket 3. I was so impressed with the quality and height adjustability of the 13CM version that I purchased the 20CM version as well. The 20cm version came with the bonus of a phone mount and Bluetooth remote in the package which makes it a better value IMO. K&F was not a brand I was familiar with just a couple of years ago, but I have to say everything that I have acquired filters, accessories, and batteries have been of high quality and fit the application I was applying them to perfectly. Not only will these work with the Pocket 3 as intended, but the stands are sturdy enough to support a table-mounted mirrorless camera with a cage. It's rare that I receive something as a Vine reviewer and go out and purchase other complementary products from the same manufacturer. This decision was a \"no brainer\".",

                "reviewText": "Weight of the item is 169g, just as specified. All metal construction, save for the rubber leg ends, which are not too grippy, but will prevent scratching of surfaces. If you want to take a picture on a flat surface, this should handle a pretty large rig, the specs say up to 44 pounds. Balancing 44 lbs on this small tripod would be quite a feat.Could make for good use as a grip under a camera; as the legs fit together quite well when collapsed. I can see this working best for off camera flash / lighting, in my use cases. I suppose you could put a ball mount / other additional mount on top to give it more flexibility.For the price, it's a good buy.",
