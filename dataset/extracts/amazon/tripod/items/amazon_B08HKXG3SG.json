                "reviewText": "I tested this out with my phone and it\u2019s great. It\u2019s easy to use and understand. It\u2019s so lightweight that I was actually skeptical Lol but after I put my phone in it and adjusted all the dynamics, it was as sturdy as any other stand. It even has hook up for cameras and a remote that connects to your phone. Once it\u2019s collapsed down, it small enough to carry with you anywhere. It comes with a black pouch with strings so that you can carry it. Definitely worth the purchase!",

Like others said it is nice that the phone holds the phone by screwing the holding parts together rather than the clamps that many other companies use. Somebody mentioned that you couldn't swivel the phone downwards to made a cooking video, but as you can see in the picture this worked just fine for me.",
