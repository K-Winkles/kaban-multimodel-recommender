If you have additional requirements, you can choose according to the actual situation. 2. What is the difference between carbon fiber tripod and aluminum tripod? For the same size tripod,carbon fiber will weigh about 30% less than aluminum alloy, and its strength will be higher, and it will not rust. But the value is also higher. 3. How to choose the tripod loading capacity? You can choose according to the weight of camera and lens, for example your equipment is 2kg, it is suggested to choose the tripod bearing above 4kg. 4.What is the difference between the twist lock and the lever lock? The structure of the twist lock is simple, easy to replace parts, disassemble, clean and maintain. The lever lock opens faster and is easy to operate with one hand. 5. Can other gimbal be installed? Yes, any gimbal with a 3/8-inch port on the bottom is compatible.",

So I only look for a tripod at a reasonable price that doesn't fall apart within a few touches.Then I saw this first from Laura BC, digged a little bit and decide to purchase it.First impression is it might be a bit heavy-ish, but feels solid, sturdy, like I can fight with this tripod. I kinda like the orange accent though I often prefer all-black gears. It is more compact than I though, which is nice. Came in a shoulder bag and assemble was straightforward. Everything else is already shown by the seller or other reviewers.One thing that is just slightly inconvenient is that it takes 5 locks to fully extend instead of 3, though I still prefer the twist lock over the snap lock. Just slightly slower, but not a deal breaker for me. Still love it.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Not a better sub $100 tripod out there. Period.",
                "reviewText": "A tri-pod in it's simplest form is a three-legged stand for supporting a camera or other apparatus. I've used several tripods throughout the years, and each one excels at one thing or another. Some are light, some are super sturdy, and some are miniature making them easy to pack away or carry on a day trip.For my general photography use (product photography, long exposures) I've found that finding the right set of compromises leads to the best tripod for my needs. That's where I've found the K&F to excel at meeting my specific set of needs. Here's what I like:The tripod is light. It's not feather weight, or forget it's there light, but it's light enough to be able to carry around all day strapped to a comfortable camera bag. Weighing in at just 3.3 lbs, it's about as light of a travel tripod built of aluminum I could expect.Completely folded, this tripod is about 17 inches long. Plenty of \"collapsability\" to be able to pack it on the side of your bag without it sticking up in the air.This tripod feels really well built for being a sub $100 travel tripod. When you hold it, it feels and looks substantial. Not heavy, just very tight tolerances, and generally aesthetically pleasing. The anodizing on the aluminum lock-outs and ball head are a really nice touch. It is rated to hold 22lbs/10kg. I'm certain it will hold that easily, if not more. The rubber grips are all implemented nicely with zero movement between the rubber grip and the lock out it turns.So, the absolute most important factor for me in a tripod, is obviously the stability. While this tripod will extend to almost 69 inches/175 cm, it's most stable when the center support is at the mid to low setting, and only the top three leg extensions are out. It's absolutely rock solid at it's med high, to mid level settings. When everything is extended to full height, a strong wind would absolutely introduce some movement.Leg lock outs are as expected. They lock out firmly and confidently when unfolding. When extending the legs, the rubber twist locks are easily tightened and I have zero doubt about their ability to stay put.The 28mm ball head is surrounded by what looks like a teflon sleeve offering smooth camera movements. The head also pans buttery smooth like a geared or fluid head would. The Arca-Swiss mount is a great option and seems to be the new standard in quick mounts. The Arca base also has a spirit level which is handy if your camera doesn't have in-camera level indication.One leg is designed to be used as a monopod. I don't use that feature, but it's nice to have and easy to transition. Under center post is a bag or weight hook. This can be removed revealing a 3/8 female mount. Great for mounting a second ball head for quick camera position swaps. My only gripe would be that the feet are not replaceable. They are shallow spiked rubber feet that are not interchangeable. They work fine for light duty use.All in all, I am very happy with this tripod purchase. At $90, I'm not sure you could get a better photo tri-pod for general use photography. It's lightweight, stable, and looks great. Just buy this tripod already, you won't be disappointed.",

Very nice accompanying bag and versatile assembly.Converting it to a monopod was not difficult but I did temporarily lose the small screw/hook at the bottom of the center rod. I later found it and will be more careful next time.One big disadvantage is the weight and size. This thing is not small or light by any standards. I took it for a long hike once and probably won\u2019t do it again. I might buy a smaller and lighter tripod for hiking occasions.Having said this, in my experience, this tripod is of excellent quality and has worked exceptionally well for its intended purpose. I do recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I used this for the first time last week on a video shoot. That's my primary function.Used it with a GH5.I needed something I could throw in a carryon. It was great for that. It folds up nice and small.And it is surprising how tall this tripod can get. If you extend both risers in the middle it is plenty tall for most people I will interview. At that height, it is important to always be next to the tripod as it is not a beefy tripod and I would worry about it falling with a wind gust. That said, it supported the weight fine.The downside of shooting video with the tripod is trying to do any pans or tilts. You are limited to very small pans and tilts just aren't a thing.It is great that there is a leveling bubble. It is easily visible and that was a lifesaver.If it had more video functionality I'd give it 5 stars, but for the size this is a solid 4 and a great little tripod.",

                "reviewText": "Upgraded my old tripod to this new design and I'm pretty pleased with it. I bought a K&C Concept tripod two years ago, it was more of a traditional design, which worked really well for me past two years. However, that was a little bulky, even when folded and in its bag, so it was harder to bring it during travelling. I checked for newer tripod design and saw this so I gave it a try, and it was much better design than its predecessor. When this tripod is folded, and stores in its carrying bag, it's only about 20 inches long. The carrying case is also well padded, so it's easier to wear on my shoulders. The tripod itself also weight much lighter, provides much better portability. I like the new ball head design, it's easier and faster to securely attach/remove my Canon DSLR onto it and easier to rotate it 360 degrees during photoshoot. It can also be changed into a monopod quickly by pulling up the center stick. The three legs looks smaller, but they are sturdier and can be locked/unlocked faster. The orange metal pieces on the tripod also make it looks much nicer and more attractive than those standard one color tripod out there. Overall, it was a really upgrade for me.",
