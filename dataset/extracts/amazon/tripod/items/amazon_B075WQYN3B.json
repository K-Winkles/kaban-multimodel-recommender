                "reviewText": "Impression: I wasn't expecting this to be a professional tool that would last me for several years (it isn't LOL), but it's surprised me how durable it is. It's it's horribly cheap or flimsy like I half expected. Been about 1.5 years now and it still works perfect. It hasn't broken yet at least LOLQuality: Decent. Material isn't super great quality but it isn't terrible flimsy plastic. Parts are reasonably thick enough to provide adequate support for my phone. Don't try a DSLR, it'll probably collapse it. Digital cameras may be iffy depending on the weight. Legs are thick enough to provide stability when placing the phone on it.Stability: Indoors, it's great. Doesn't move until you move it, very portable and light weight but still works as intended. Outdoors, I can see potentially how it can fail if a very strong wind blows and it may collapse. Especially if you expand it to its full height. More resistance to the wind, and not enough resistance at the base. Recommended to put something to hold down the base if you're going to do any outdoor photography and use this as a tripod.Portability: Very light, easy to expand and retract. I put it away after very use, and it's very easy to pull it back out and set it up againHeight: It was actually taller than I expected. Description does say it goes to 4ft, but I wasn't actually expecting it to be capable of doing it. When I first purchased online, I thought beyond 3ft, the stick would be too thin and the whole thing would break or collapse if I tried to max it out. BUT IT WORKED. I've been usually using it at max height for all my shoots and it works fine.Things I liked: I actually really liked the snap buttons that locked the height increases. Easy to use, no hassle with trying to turn buttons or knobs.Price: Decent for the quality I gotWord of advice: Don't buy if you're expecting professional industry quality tripod. Go to a camera store for that, seriously. For the average user, this works fine.",

                "reviewText": "An excellent value for what you pay, but not really sturdy enough for using at multiple locations or alot of travel.I use these daily to mount my cell phones for use as webcams and to take product shots. They're relatively easy to get a phone as large as an s22 ultra with a thick protective case on it in and out of the mount. It extends easily and you can get it to hold position fairly well.I didn't find the remote particularly useful, but I don't have much use for it, so I'm neutral on it's capability. They're not overlly sturdy, so I wouldn't recommend them for a heavier camera, or for lots of travel with set up and break down, but they're great for simple use and an excellent value when you don't want to spend the money, or have a need, for the far more expensive options on the market.",

It also has a remote to start and stop videos and do picture capture. The only thing is you have to connect your Bluetooth everytime you use the remote. You get a carry bag so that it's easy to carry you tripod selfie stick. Very good value for the product.",

The versatility of transitioning it into a selfie stick is incredibly convenient.
