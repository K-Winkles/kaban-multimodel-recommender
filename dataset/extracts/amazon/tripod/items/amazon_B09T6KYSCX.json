My only complaint is they sent a really nice storage bag, that won't hold the stand. The storage bag is long and narrow, so the top tray couldn't fit in it at all. The base will fit, only if you unscrew all the sections and pull them apart from each other. For most people, that may not be a big deal but, I have a hand disability, so that is a major inconvenience for me. I was hoping I could just collapse the stand and stick it in a storage bag. Oh well! Now to look for a bag I can buy that will fit the bill. \ud83e\udd37 All in all, though, it is a great product.",

Luckily, I was able to have it all up and built in about 10 minutes from the time I opened it.Stability of the stand when holding my projector wasn't too bad either. It can be a little wobbly at times. Fortunately, there are a few adjustable knobs that can help alleviate this issue. The platform is also pretty large and features straps that to hold down your projector.Overall, this is a pretty affordable solution to those who need a fairly quality stand for their projector.",
