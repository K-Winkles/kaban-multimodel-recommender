Small enough not to take up to much room. But strong and height enought for our lights. We can fit 3 of these stand where our normal tripod would go. Not to mention the units telescope staff is strong enough to hold the light (around 3 lbs) at a 70 degree angle for the more hard to reach lighting spots and still remain out of the camera range.",

Made taking my photos while traveling alone were much easier and faster.The only downsizes are that the remote has to be activated every time you use it and I will probably recommend bring an additional battery for it since the one from factory didn't really last long) and it's heavier than many other tripods out there. Still, it was worth it: perfect height (I'm 6'2\") and the angle and stability are great!",
