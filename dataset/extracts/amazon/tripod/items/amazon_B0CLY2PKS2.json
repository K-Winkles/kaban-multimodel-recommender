                "reviewText": "This is a great small tripod. It works with mobile phones, devices that take a standard tripod mount and GoPro cameras. The designer(s) put considerable thought into the needs of modern digital users (though I wish they had thought about users who need robust phone cases - more on that below). The feet are rubber-like spheres so you can place it on most any surface and it will remain stable without scratching the surface as I show it resting on the roof of my car (admittedly an old junker but even if it were a nice car or a nice wood table I would not hesitate). At the same time, the tripod legs are flexible so they can be wrapped around objects to mount the tripod in a variety of ways that would be impossible were the legs simply ordinary plastic or metal. You can see how I attached it on a small tree while large binoculars are mounted on it. It held firmly without the binoculars needed to rest against the tree at all. My ONLY complaint about this system (and the reason for 4 rather than 5 stars) is that the mount for mobile phones doesn't do as well as it should with even slightly thick phone cases. (I don't show this because I was too lazy to use my laptop to take pics and my iPad was stolen). If the edges on the phone holder were only 1/4 inch higher this would not be an issue. I STRONGLY recommend this be rectified in future versions of this otherwise fine product. The mobile phone holder grips phones tightly but the edges that come over the top of the phone won't reach over the edge of a phone like my iPhone 13 ProMax with an even slightly thick case so if I'm not careful when turning it at certain angles the phone can start to slip out. I pressed it in place as hard as possible to be sure it seated as well as it could. I don't have a thick case like a military grade box-like case. In fact it's a MagSafe compatible case but it's a thick phone and the case adds just enough extra to keep the edges from properly gripping. It didn't need to be this way. It's easy to remove the phone holder to use with cameras and binoculars etc that take a standard tripod mount and it has and attachment for GoPro cameras (I don't have a GoPro but I read how to attach it and it's very straightforward). The included wireless remote is nice but I now have at least 5 wireless mobile phone remotes because they are included with so many products. My Apple Watch also has this function. You can also buy these everywhere for just a few dollars so nice inclusion if you don't have one already, but nothing special. All in all, this is still an excellent tripod but if you have a mobile phone with a thick case you might want to keep looking unless you also have a GoPro or really need some other feature of this tripod that you can't find elsewhere.",

                "reviewText": "Form and finish of the Lamicall flexible leg tripod are high quality with no manufacturing flaws found during inspection and testing. The tripod supports many different devices including the Motorola Android phone I tested it with. As seen in the images it had no trouble mounting both my phone and DSLR camera with a fill light mounted simultaneously as accessory using the standard 1/4\" X 20 threaded insert on the side of the mount (pictured). Note, the fill light and double ball arm pictured do not come with this tripod, I just mounted them to demonstrate the tripod's accessory capability. This fill light setup is going to be very useful for taking review photos, among other projects.While the listing seems to suggest this tripod is designed for iPhones my Android phone worked perfectly with the included phone mount and bluetooth remote shutter release which paired with the phone without difficulty and functioned flawlessly. My phone, including thin case, is a slightly under 3/8\" thick and the tripod's phone mount clamp secured it perfectly. However the clamp jaws are 1/2 inch deep (pictured) so thicker phones or phones with thick cases may not mount as securely. The phone mount jaws open to a maximum of 3.8\" (minimum 2\") hence phones substantially wider will not fit (you could angle a slightly larger phone in). The 4\" to 7\" dimension mentioned in the listing must be phone length, which really isn't a relevant dimension with respect to phone mounting. The phone mount includes two threaded inserts to accommodate vertical or horizontal mounting.To mount any device that has a standard 1/4\" X 20 threaded insert (such as the DSLR and fill light pictured) you simply fold the phone mount jaws down, unscrew the phone mount and then screw the mount onto the threaded tripod stud from the opposite side, which leaves the 1/4\" X 20 tripod stud protruding beyond the mount surface. A rubber pad on the mount provides friction needed for secure mounting. You can also screw the included Go Pro mount onto the stud to support any device with a Go Pro style mount. The tripod folds compactly so it will be is easy to carry and store (see picture relative to pen).The tripod legs do in fact bend dramatically, as pictured in the listing, which will not only be useful for mounting on a poles or similar structures but also comes in handy when you need to move them out of frame for close shots or angle the entire tripod for surface shots. That plus the wide range of adjustment offered by the tripod's ball mount should accommodate just about any setup you can think of.This is a cleverly designed, tremendously versatile and well built tripod mount. I suspect it is going to become a go to mount for many types of projects.",
