And the clamping range is 2.2inch-3.38inch, which is suitable for most mobile phones. Q2: What is the difference between ULANZI FT-01 and ULANZI MT-11? The flexible tripod legs of the new FT-01 use 3 layers of aluminum core, while the MT-11 uses 1 layer of aluminum core, so the tripod legs of the FT-01 will be more durable.
