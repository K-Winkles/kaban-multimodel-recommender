To prove that he did a workout he has to submit a video of his activity. We bought this tripod to show him playing basketball, football tennis, squat thrusts etc.. Your get the idea. It is nice because we needed a tripod that is light, easy to unfold and fold up again, that keeps a good grip on our cell phone and yet is easy to attach and detach the phone. This tripod fit all of these requirements. It's like having our own personal videographer on call. We are not happy with all of the fearmongering and changes due to Covid-19 but have no fear.

                "reviewText": "Wow this is such a cool product! I haven\u2019t tried the remote yet so can\u2019t comment on that but I love the product so much. You can attach your DSLR camera or phone and everything is completely adjustable. It comes pretty small and I thought it would only go up a short length but it was adjustable up to almost my ceiling! It allows you to tilt up down & around which is awesome. Someone else said that you can only do landscape holding of the cellphone but you can actually rotate it (so many different adjustable things so I get not being able to figure it out). The ring light does need to be plugged in which means it can\u2019t go suuuuper tall when using the ring light (the only thing I would change so far would be to make that cord longer). The tripod light gets super bright and has levels of brightness you can adjust. It\u2019s lightweight, obviously not going to last for decades or anything but it\u2019s affordable & has so much adjustability & many features.For $19 I was honestly expecting a piece of crap but I\u2019m very impressed so far!!",

It did not take much before one of the legs snapped off. While I appreciate the price, the quality just wasn't there. I feel like there are better products in a similar price range.",
