                "reviewText": "I love this tripod! It arrived promptly and I put it together in about 5 minutes. It is so easy to expand and contract. I love the fact that it is lightweight so I can take it with me on hikes (about 1.6lbs). It can be used as both a tripod or a selfie stick.A phone or small camera can be in a vertical or horizontal position as you can see in the photos. It can be set as very tall or very short. It comes with a remote that you will need to pair through BlueTooth with your phone.I really like that you can move the phone in any various directions and angles to position it they way you want. I am excited to be able to take photos now with the back camera on my phone (in addition to the front). As you know the back camera is a much better camera.Also the phone mount expands and contracts according to the phone size so when/if I upgrade to a different phone, I don't have to worry about its size. This tripod will work with it as well. It seems sturdy even though it is lightweight. It can hold a small camera, I put one I have on it and it had no problems but mine is not blue tooth enabled so I did not try the remote with it. I did use the remote with my iphone I7+ and it connected readily.When finished it can be compacted and stored in my backpack. I would likely hook the remote to my key chain so I won't loose it. It has a small hook.I am looking forward to taking this tripod with me on my next hiking adventure!",

                "reviewText": "PACKAGING was beyond expectations, and it comes with a carrying bag.QUALITY is amazing, it's lightweight and assembles with perfection; there is no shortage of clamps and adjustable parts that work with precision.PERFORMANCE is fantastic. The tripod feet are adjustable along with three lengths of extension rod; the phone holder is secure and has many adjustments besides being quick to set up. Even the remote is of good quality (compared to others I have purchased), and they even include an additional CR2032 battery besides the one that is already installed in the remote.PRICE - worth ever penny! I'm going to buy more for adult Christmas gifts because I'm THAT impressed.Get yours before they're sold out.Disclaimer: I have not been solicited nor have I received merch from this seller; and I rarely leave reviews but felt SO happy with the tripod that I had to share my review.",

                "reviewText": "The tripod portion is sturdier than others of similar build. I tried 5 other similar tripods. This tripod stopped shaking the fastest after receiving a slight bump. Regardless, all tripods of this style (short legs, long neck) are fighting against physics because it is an inherently unstable design. You sacrifice stability and gain portability, but it is stable enough for light duty work on level ground away from wind. This style of tripod is for cell phones and/or light accessories. If you need more stability at a height of 5 feet, then you should go with a tripod with longer legs for the wider base, but you will have less portability. But if the tripod is too clunky, you are not going to travel with it. The best tripod is the one you have with you.Regarding the ball joint and spring-loaded holder, I quickly replaced that portion with other devices I have. If you look at the reviews, the ball joint and holder are the source of almost all complaints.",

                "reviewText": "I wasn't expecting much from a tripod at this price, but I'm extremely impressed with it. The design is fantastic and it's very easy to configure. Out of the box, it took me less than a minute to set up.It's very lightweight but incredibly sturdy. It extends to over 6 feet tall but can also fit into its keyboard sized bag. I'm really amazed by this tripod. You can use it as a selfie stick if you want, and it's very very easy to take off the tripod. It comes with a controller that's easy to set up with your phone, and they even included an extra battery.My favorite part about this tripod is that it actually holds my brick of a phone. Pictured is the samsung s20 in a love mei case. The case is extremely thick and heavy, but the phone holder has no problem clamping it. It's a very strong phone holder, and it's the main reason I bought this vicseed product (I bought their phone mount for my car and it's also great). This product comes with a 12 month warranty, but once you register it online you get an extra 18 month warranty (30 month warranty total). I'm very impressed by this tripod and it's construction/functionality. Would definitely recommend",

I'm using it for camera videos and phone photos. Two heads for camera and phone are very easy to switch as needed. The knob is very sensitive to connect and excellent to control without delay. It came with two batteries for knob, so I don\u2019t need to worry about if I use it outside photo shooting.I tried use the tripod on different floor situations, it always be very stable as it comes the additional support at the bottom. And also, the top head can adjust camera or phone\u2019s angle. My experience so far is this is a tremendous value for most users with very-good equipment. I'm very happy with these tripods so far. I also love the fact that it comes with its own bag. Great value for the price. Definitely would recommend this to my friends!!!",
