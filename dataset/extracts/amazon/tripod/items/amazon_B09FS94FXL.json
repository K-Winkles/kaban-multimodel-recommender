                "reviewText": "The Auto Face Tracking Tripod is a budget-friendly option for those looking for a phone camera mount that can rotate 360 degrees. I purchased this tripod in 2021 and have been using it for a few years now.Pros:-Inexpensive-No app required-360\u00b0 rotation for versatile shooting options-Rechargeable batteryCons:-Auto face tracking is not always accurateOverall, this tripod is a good option for those on a budget. It is easy to set up and use, and the rechargeable battery is a convenient feature. However, I did find that the auto face tracking feature is not always accurate.In terms of value for money, this tripod is a good choice. It is relatively inexpensive compared to other options on the market and offers a range of features. However, if you are looking for a tripod with more advanced or accurate face tracking capabilities, it may be worth spending a bit more on a higher-end product.In conclusion, the Auto Face Tracking Tripod is a good budget-friendly option for those looking for a phone camera mount for vlogging or live streaming. It is not suitable for professional or high-quality video production, but for the price it is good.",
