The unit feels cheap, but is sturdy and versatile. It already has quite a bit of use, and just get collapsed and thrown in my tool bag or box at the end of the day.I have used the phone clamp to take some photos of the project, just because i could. Convenient, and also sturdy.It does not have a fine tune height adjustment, but I have found the sliding bar/set screw to be just fine and able to get the spot i need without much fuss (actually quicker than the Bosch unit with fine tune, due to the wide \"clicks\" or the rack/gear on the bosch)",

                "reviewText": "This is my second Joilcan tripod. I researched really hard the first time, and was looking for the best 70+\" tripod, as I am relatively tall and wanted it to be close to my own point of view. It was tough because I noticed a surprisingly big price jump around the 60-70\" level (I guess hard to stabilize right around there?). Joilcan had amongst the highest reviews of those with reasonable prices (I didn't want the stratospheric $100 or even $75 ones). I also liked the beautiful colors, as I got mine in an exciting blue instead of boring black. I clocked that one in around $40. Been using it for over a year and pretty pleased.I came back to AMZN for a second one this BF thinking I could use a portable one to throw in the stroller. I had recently used a cheapie selfie stick/tripod in the park and the wind blew it over and scratched up my phone, not to mention many pictures were slightly slanted because of the wind. So stability was high on my list. I saw a really good deal for $8 on a lightweight (1.1lb?) tripod, but some reviews said it blew in the wind as well. So I kept going. OMG! There was my great friend Joilcan, which I already loved. Actually, I had searched for Joilcan first, knowing I already trusted the brand, but for some reason AMZN only brought up the very tall 70+\" expensive ones again, and this time I wanted a cheaper one as it was just for temporary usage. I couldn't believe it, not only did I find the 65\" I was looking for at a much cheaper price than my 72\", but in fact it was another half off (remember, it was BF). Most importantly, it still weighs in at 2.8lbs, much more stable than the other 1 and change tripods I saw. Like my first one, I got it in my color (blue), but unlike my first one (or the cheaper model I saw before), it also included a clicker -- which I wanted, since my last one wasn't working well. I jumped on the deal, and the rest is history. The product is as good as the original one, just a few inches shorter. My only small beef is that it's hard to fold it correctly to fit back in the carrying case. But, I only tried once so far, I'm sure I'll get it next time...",

                "reviewText": "So far it's very sturdy! All the legs come out smoothly and are very easy to put up in a hot second. You can adjust the head swivel or tilt it have your camera in any orientation you want and lock it in. You can even have the lock at halfway so that the swivel go smoothly yet firmly, or have it completely unlocked and it will go very smoothly. There's a hook at the bottom to put weight on it, but I don't think you need weight in a breeze. This is heavy enough to stand on its own in wind, but is very light to carry around without wearing you out. There's a gauge on the side that tells you if you are level or not, but you won't need it because the head is so adjustable and can lock in the camera at whatever orientation YOU see is levelled. This is my first tripod, and I need it for long exposures, like sunsets, waterfalls, astrophotography. This is a quality sturdy product that will last thru wind and be quick to set up in the heat of the moment. I like that it's sturdy and can tighten the camera so it wont fall over on the stand which was the problem with my hand me down",

Also it is light weight so taking it on a hiking trip is fine. Folds up into a small light package. I would buy it again.",
