Yes, it is a little wobbly at the tallest setting, but not so much that you can't take a good picture with it. The grip for the phone is also pretty strong so I'm not worried about the phone falling out. The remote works perfectly with my android phone and all I had to do was connect to it via Bluetooth. It's compact and small once collapsed. Overall very happy with it and would recommend for anyone looking for a cheap holder.",

                "reviewText": "Just got it today, the price was great but I'm not sure this is will work. 1st, it's really tricky to open the tripod. You have to pull really hard on the bottom to seperate the 3 \"legs\". Once you get them open a tad, the rod will pop out the top making it easier to fully extend.A lot of people said theirs didn't come with the remote. Unlikely. More likely they didn't notice it. See my photos. You need to extend the rod up before sliding the remote out.If you have an android, you may need to change your camera settings in your camera app to get the remote to work. At 1st all it was doing was increasing the phone volume. Once I changed the settings, it took the photo with the remote. See my photos. I'm worried about the stability of this. I bought it to record myself playing disc golf. It's good to be able to see your form. But that means I'll be outside in wind & the 3 legs on the tripod are so short & flimsy & the whole contraption is so light I'm afraid a 5 mph wind will knock it over. My screen is cracked so a fall from 50\" up may ruin my phone. I'm not sure about this. I feel like I'm asking for trouble with this one. I may end up returning it. I'll update this review after I've had a chance to use it outside. I guess if you're using it as a selfie stick that won't matter. But I wanted it for its tripod abilities. I hope I didn't make a big mistake \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c",
