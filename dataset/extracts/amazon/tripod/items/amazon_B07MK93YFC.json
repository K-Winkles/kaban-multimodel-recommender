This stick is so great for family and friend get-togethers, nature scenes, and getting great shots in difficult/blocked settings. A+",

They tried to send me a new one but with the covid and the situation going on there was a little bit of a problem. So they gave me a different option and that's to refund me which I was okay with that too. Great customer service and customer care. I understand things happen and I'm just glad they provided solutions to this situation. Thank you customer service for your time and help.Old review : I only used it once and I wasn't even handling it hard and it broke.It arrived nicely packaged and on time. Unfortunately, it didn't work.It's lightweight and very easy to use, remote control works fine and it disconnect when you're not using for long period of time but click on the button couple times then it will reconnect itself.It's not sturdy I give it zero stars. Easy to use 3 stars because it broke as I was trying to extend it. Remote 5stars it was easy and worked with my note 9.They reply to me and willing to give me a new one if I submit pictures to proof it, so here it is.",

I wish the holder could be rotated and locked but it works ok as is... and also wish the tripod had some kind of lock and grip set up. It can be a little awkword to hold at times. Like I said, for the money it's my first selfie stick and I think I'll get some use out of it when fishing and kayaking come back around.",

                "reviewText": "Do not use this as a selfie stick. My phone keeps falling off and it does NOT secure your phone from falling off. It does have a fixture that secures your phone to the selfie stick BUT it sucks and doesn't work. I guess you can use it as a tripod at least but your phone will either be tilted a little downwards or upwards a bit if you don't mind that but if there is to many movements going around you your phone will fall off easy. I give it 1 star because I bought for taking selfies and making small videos for my family and I want to properly record myself in different angles and this selfie stick doesn't do that.Update: tried to return it but forgot about it after 2 months later so I couldn't return it or do anything with it so I threw it away.",
