                "reviewText": "As a novice photographer this provides a way to control lighting via a led ring light which attaches to a coupler and then to the tripod stand, allowing for tilt and 360 degree adjustment. It has a variety of attachments for a mobile phone camera. These have springs inside which recoil the clamp after being fitted with a mobile phone camera. These attachments vary in an effort to provide flexibility in camera positioning. The stand itself is extendable and each telescoping section locks with a simple 1/8 (or so) twist. The collapsible tripod is about 13\" vertically. The telescoping part screws into the base tripod.left side uses light box lighting. Right side uses the ring light (notice it is not in the picture).",

                "reviewText": "I got this light ring because of its cost--it's a very inexpensive option for me, as I tend to do one to two Zoom calls a week. It's easy to use, right out of the box. Within minutes of getting it, I had the tripod set up. It's user-friendly: a twist at the joint and the stand extends to the height you need.The light ring easily screwed on to the tripod. You will need an adapter if you're plugging it into a wall outlet that doesn't have a USB port, but once it was plugged it, it worked perfectly. The attached picture shows the ring on its brightest setting. The light is brilliant, and sufficient to bring out facial features while on a call.Once my daughters saw it was set up, they borrowed it for a school Teams meeting. Their call lasted two solid hours, with no issue. The tripod stayed extended the whole time with no issue, and the light stayed at its full intensity with no problem. GREAT!We haven't tried the accessories yet, and look forward to it. There are several holders for cell phones to plug right into the center of the light ring. We haven't tried putting a heavy camera on the tripod (the light ring is very light weight). It's a good product, and you can't beat the price!",

                "reviewText": "I have a Pixel 7 pro. This device struggles to hold the weight of my phone.I had everything tightened as much as possible and it was still struggling to hold my phone up and maintain a position. The light kept tipping forward and moving the camera angle.The brackets that hold your phone are flimsy and not strong enough, nor wide enough to hold a phone with a protective case around it.In order to try to get my phone to stay in the bracket, I took the protective case off. Bad choice. The tripod has a very poor locking mechanism (you have to twist it to prevent it from going up and down and it easily untwists while you're trying to adjust your camera angle).Long story short, I was trying to manipulate the light and camera and ended up accidentally twisting the center pole which made the tripod collapse in on itself. It dropped my phone and now my brand new Pixel 7 pro screen is destroyed.I like all the features that come with this, but it's not high quality. I create cooking videos and it's not great for a direct down angle on something you're working on. Better for filming something face to face or cross the room because of the angles. The feet on the tripod make it difficult to position the camera if you're using it up against a counter.I could not get the Bluetooth remote to work with my phone at all. I tried everything.",
