                "reviewText": "I have to say it took a lot of thought and studying the reviews of these before pulling the trigger on my need for two of them, but I did and they seem really a decent bargain for how much they will be used. I have some Manfrottos that are a similar form factor, but they were quite a bit more money (double? triple?) and have held up OK and I have hopes for these as well. These get taller than my Manfrottos, too.I didn't see any of the problems that other reviewers have reported.A huge bonus to me is that they came in what seem to be decent quality carrying bags, and each on had two quick-release plates with them. The hugeness of the bonus is that the plates also fit my Manfrotto stands/heads, so it won't matter which camera has which plate. I very much appreciate that.The one weak-seeming part to me is the way the handle attaches to the head does not seem to tighten very tight on the handle, making it easy to rotate when it should be solid. I think I'll be able to figure something out for that, and these will mostly be for assistants to use, so I'll only be vicariously aggravated if they do rotate. Some applications won't need to use the handles.I like them so far.",

                "reviewText": "It's not Manfrotto but it doesn't have to be at 1/5th the cost.I'd take 5 of these over 1 Manfrotto any day... oh wait, I have.Had one arrive over-tight and the Pan-head jumped a bit every 10th of a rotation but this was easily fixed by loosening the screw a bit.I do a lot of multi-cam broadcast and my gear tends to get beat up by operators of variable experience levels. With a bit of maintenance from time to time even my oldest Avella 501 is still working fine. The cross brace is a bit flimsy and you have to watch for lost screws there... that's my only real complaint.",

The tilt and pan has an easy lockup/tightening mechanism when you need to \"set your shot\". For the price it's a great tripod, but it has it's limits. I still use a remote to fire the shutter on my camera to avoid any movement.",

                "reviewText": "***Mind the tension settings on the leg locks, esp the lower legs that you don't use in most situations. A Torx 15 wrench fits them and they are not adjusted when you get them, so the locks can be slip if you haven't set them up properly. It's easy to do, just be aware it of this.***I got this to use with a Lumix DSLR and it is the right size and weight for that camera. It extends to about 72\" in two leg sections and is sturdy and with its flip locks on the legs set up is quick. Leveling ball head (with bubble level) is nice and the pan and tilt work but are not up to the grade of a mid-range tripod as far as smoothness. Drag is not adjustable, there's just a lock off on both pan and tilt, which makes precision moves tricky to say the least.",

I now have four of them and they are awesome. These are not ultra light but I want a tripod to be a solid base and a little bit of extra weight is actually a plus.",
