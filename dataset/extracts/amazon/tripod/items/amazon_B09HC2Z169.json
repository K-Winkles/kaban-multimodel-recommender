                "reviewText": "This tripod is terrific to carry around just about anywhere. It is extremely lightweight and quick to setup. My only complaint is that it does not feel very sturdy with heavier items, such as DSLR cameras, but it does state a weight limit of 6.6lbs. Additionally, it feels like it is made of plastic, and I believe the reason for this is to maintain being very lightweight. I do admit to having been able to use my DSLR on it plenty of times, so I can confirm that it works. However, I am always making sure to have the camera strap on me in case the tripod does break or topple over. DSLRs aside, this is a TERRIFIC overall tripod. It is great for a wide variety of things such as holding an extra set of lights, holding a phone, holding reflectors, and holding action cameras. I have used it plenty of times and even purchased another one because I like it so much!",

I wanted one that had long legs all the way up for more stability (we always have lots of kids running around and I was worried with the three legged ones only at the bottom they would tip it over) this one definitely delivers! It comes with a phone holder that comes off as well and the remote works great for my little to take selfies with!",
