                "reviewText": "The product pics show you just about everything you can do with this selfie stick. It extends pretty far but it's a bit stiff to open and close, which is good for sturdiness. It comes with a metal ring to stick onto the back of your phone in order to utilize the magnet on the stick. Of course if you have one of those pop-up do-dads on the back of your phone that enables you to hold it more securely, this selfie stick is not for you. I have a metal ring on the back of my phone and I have a magnet kick stand loop thingy that allows me to hold the phone in my hand more securely. I can also just take it off whenever I want. That's why I chose this selfie stick, because I already have the metal ring and I can pull off the kick stand to attach my phone to the stick.The material this is buil;t out of is said to be some aluminum alloy but it feels like plastic. It has a remote button which is probably one of the best features and it's rechargeable. The remote really free one up to be able to start and stop recording at will without loosing one's position. Depending on how you edit or don't edit, the remote is great.There are little arms that widen to hold your phone securely. They barely fit my phone. If phones get bigger again, this selfie stick will be obsolete unless you're comfortable with just the magnet. If your doing physical action types of recording the magnet alone may be enough but I have not tested it. I don't trust a magnet all that much but that's just me.",

My granddaughter likes the rod and as you can see in the second picture, she props it up on a chair to use it similar to a tripod. It grips the phone well and holds it tight. We are simply disappointed the entire item as pictured did not arrive.",
