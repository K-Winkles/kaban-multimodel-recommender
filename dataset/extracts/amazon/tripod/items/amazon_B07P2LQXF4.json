                "reviewText": "This tripod is great for a beginner on a budget or the casual photographer. The tripod is sturdy, made of mostly metal components, and has many of the features of a higher end tripod. Weight is not an issue and it's compact size makes it easy to carry around. I keep mine in the tripod holder on the side of my backpack, in the provided case, and it fits nicely, it's inconspicuous, and it doesn't get in the way.Extended fully, the tripod lacks the rigidity to stand up to slight wind, impacting image quality. Extending only half of the top section resolves this issue. The ball head is solid and holds my 70-400mm (a heavy lens) nicely. There are a couple of set screws on the ball head which allow slight movements and locking it in. The rotation is fairly smooth, but not enough for video pans.The flexibility of the tripod height is great. You can use this thing with the camera on the ground, by flipping the upper section, or all the way to a comfortable height for a 6' person. It is easy to adjust the height with the flip lock tabs and is quick to setup.Overall, I would say this tripod is a great buy. While the premium features aren't on par with other high end tripods, they are much better that you can get for the same price, or even those priced at moderately higher prices. The flexibility of this tripod would cover the the use of most camera users and at a great price. It has allowed me to capture some great/crisp landscape shots, portraits (indoor and out), and festive deco shots.",

                "reviewText": "I actually tried several tripods that I was NOT happy with, and returned, en route to finding this gem.So for anyone else comparing to comparably priced/sized tripods, I ordered and tested the Mactrem 80, Joilcan 82, and the ESDDI as well. The Joilcan was eliminated because the \"normal\" stance of the tripod was too narrow, and therefore tippy (and the wider stance, on all, too wide I think for my average use). The Mactrem was a disappointment because it said it was rated for 16 kilos / 35 pounds but it turned out in the fine print, it was actually just 16 pounds, not kilos. And it showed. It wouldn't hold up my Nikon D750 and VR 70-200 2.8 (maybe 12 pounds, total) without the ball head slipping, which is unacceptable for me. The ESDDI I tried 3rd, and it was mostly OK, but SIGNIFICANTLY larger and heavier than the others (which were all larger and heavier than what I had been using for years) and it still was a little slippy.Starting to think I simply wasn't going to find a \"flawless\" tripod in a reasonable price range, I stumbled upon this YoTilon, and having tried the other 3 first, it made it that much more obvious that this is a great product! Compact and light enough for travel, the plate fit super securely on my camera or lens mount (zero slippage, a problem with a couple of the others as well) and the ball head locked into place perfectly, no give whatsoever.The tripod iss steady on its feet, feels sturdy all around, despite being relatively more compact and lighter. Attention to detail seems excellent. I was so happy to take a chance on this YoTilon before totally giving up, as it really ended up being perfect for me.To top it all off, I had noticed that one of the 3 I had ordered before came with an extra mounting plate, and another had offered one, and I can't recall if YoTillon had as well (maybe in the questions somewhere?), but I contacted the company through Amazon and they replied and sent me the extra plate very quickly for free. This is super helpful, as I can leave one permanently on my camera body, and another on my 70-200 2.8 lens (long and heavy enough that it needs to be mounted separately, for balance) and don't have to mess around with constantly swapping it back and forth depending on which lens I'm using.I highly recommend giving the YoTilon tripod a chance, especially if you are comparing it to the Mactrem, Joilcan, or ESDDI.Hope this was helpful!",

Can't give 5 stars because the description says there are three adjustment knobs to fine tune positioning, and they go so far as to brag that there's 3 knobs and not 2, like the competition. There's 2. Learn your product.Now for the best part, the instructions. This product is worth every penny for the 8 rules of tripod use. I'll leave it at that. Enjoy.",

                "reviewText": "This tripod is freakin AMAZING! You would think it costs over 150.00 by the quality and sturdiness. It really is amazing. I use it for both my automotive YouTube channel and also for my Home theater installation side business with my self leveling laser level and this unit is super sturdy even on creaky wood floors when you\u2019re walking around it tends to stay really stable. For what you\u2019re going to pay for this unit, it\u2019s DEFINITELY the best one at this price point. I tried 3 others and returned them all. Came across this one, it had glowing reviews, and I pulled the trigger. Don\u2019t regret it one bit.The unit comes with a nice carrying case and folds up rather easily for storage or on the go. Look no further, this is the one.P.S. it\u2019s also SUPER tall.",

                "reviewText": "I've gone to brick and mortar stores for years, going through 4 or 5 $20-30 tripods thinking that quality ones were only in the $3-400 range.THIS TRIPOD MAKES ME LOOK STUPID FOR THINKING THATMost other tripods at this price point use plastic ball joints and aim for lightweight instead of sturdy. This one takes no shortcuts in aiming to be as sturdy as possible, including a built in weight hook. This does mean that it sacrifices a little bit in weight, but as long as you aren't hiking 10-20 miles with a full kit and camping gear, you will not mind the increase in weight, especially with the peace of mind that your camera will be safe.The head that came with this tripod is meh, but it is completely replaceable with multiple screw types to allow you to even just ditch the head entirely if you felt like it, or in my use case, attaching a gimbal directly to the base.",
