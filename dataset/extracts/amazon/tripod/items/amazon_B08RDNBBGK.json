                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Mini Tripod",
                "reviewText": "An excellent mini tripod. It is light, strong and very functional. The ball head is smooth and holds well. The legs extend easily and stay in position until the release tabs are squeezed. The legs lock in two different angles from under the ball head allowing for a low profile stance or a taller higher clearance position. The locks only engage in one direction, allowing for the tripod to be quickly collapsed back to a single handle configuration without any manipulation of the lock mechanism, yet maintains strength and stability when set up as a tripod. Extending the legs gives even more stability and makes it nearly impossible to tip even with a camera with a long and heavy lens. When collapsed to a handle, it has a very solid and comfortable feel and the extended legs give just enough added length to make it useful as a vlogging stick (I angle mine a bit and it helps to keep my hand out of the video while giving me the few extra inches I need to frame myself in reasonable proportion. I use zoom lenses with a 16mm or 18mm minimum focal length on a crop sensor camera, the effective full frame equivalents are 24mm or 27mm. The result is still a bit tight, but with the extra extension this gives, it is usable for vlogging. I plan to get a zoom lens with a 10mm to 16mm range (15mm to 24 mm equivalent) in the future, this will work even better. There are vlogging sticks that are longer, but for a mirrorless camera, lens and cage any more length would magnify any hand shake, decrease stability and increase the pressure on the hand to painful levels when holding it out for any lengthy period of time. The ball head has cutouts on both sides allowing the handle to be used up to 90 degrees and I have found this useful when I don't have my top handle on my rig. I just set it at a right angle, flip the camera upside down, use it as a top handle for getting smooth low shots and flip the video vertically in post. Another nice feature of this is the very small Swiss Arca clamp, it securely fastens directly to the base of my cage so I don't need a plate mounted. One more plus, is that it has a cold shoe mount on the side that can be smoothly rotated or tightened down (using an allan wrench) to give a convenient mounting point for a microphone, light or other accessory. This mini tripod is perfect for my needs, it allows me to set my camera down without danger of it falling over, provides lock down stablization, allows me to pan more smoothly with the support of a table or wall and works a a vlogging stick. This is the most versatile mini tripod that I have found and has by far the best build quality. Worth every penny.",

                "reviewText": "The tripod is surprisingly good. I was expecting plastic legs, but other than the q/r catches on the leg extensions which are not structural, it's all aluminium/steel.There are 2 allen keys provided. One fits the (not really big enough, but will just about do the job) arca swiss plate to the u/side of the camera if you can't tighten the slotted head screw enough, and the other can be used to tighten the side accessory shoe although it is fairly stiff anyway.They are just loose. It's a shame there is no obvious way to clip these onto the tripod, so will very soon get lost. But they are not essential.Would I buy it again? Yes.",

                "reviewText": "Review of Portable Desktop Mini Tripod PICTRON MT-24 Compact Camera TripodI bought this desktop tripod to mount my phone for stable viewing using the magnifying function on my phone. It's the perfect height and the ball swivel allows for an infinite amount of fine adjustment. The stand is stable and does not move when adjusting the views on my phone.The stand is made from aluminum and there are many ways to use the stand. You can fold all the legs together and use it as a selfie stick or unfold the legs and lay it flat on a table. There are extensions on each leg (about 3 inches) to give more height or when laying flat, more stability.It comes with a detachable foot for easy removal of a camera and there is a cold shoe on the side of the mount for attaching other items like a light.I highly recommend this versatile stand for table top use of a camera or anything that can mount using 1/4 in threads.",

                "reviewText": "Perfect for low to the ground macro shots. This is the best I could find considering size, weight, and ball head. Most tabletop tripods don't have a real ball head, but this one does. It costs more than many of the others, but I can use this on my travel tripod as well since the load rating accommodates my mirror-less setup just fine.",

Wish I could spread the legs out at more different angles, but this is still perfectly fine.I basically use this for those cases when I know I do not need a big tripod as Im not doing photography. But, for those moments when Im like damn, I wish I had it for that one shot I didn't expect, I have this. And it usually works as I can just put it up on a rock or something and it severs me well",
