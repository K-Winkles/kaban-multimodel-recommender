                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. If you often do products review on Amazon like I do, you may know how important it is to correctly showcase the product you\u2019re reviewing. A good tripod is always something to have around, but difficult to use when it comes to overhead shots.This device is exactly what I was looking for. It\u2019s fold-able, so easy to carry and store when not in use. But then, it unfolds into a telescopic phone holder, which will allow you to have your phone records your products at the desired height. I have a Samsung S22+ phone and this holder works perfectly at holding the phone without even the need to remove its case.This holder also has two integrated lights, which you can turn ON & OFF, control lights temperature and brightness, which can be controlled either by buttons on the unit itself, or using the included small remote control. The same remote could be linked to your phone, so that you could control it, without the need to actually need to press anything on your phone to take pictures or video.It\u2019s very well balanced, and so far, I didn\u2019t have any tripping over accident. It can also be used as a tripod if needed which is great and gives me the possibility of another tripod I could use for different view angles.Now for some negative that are minimal and don\u2019t affect my five-star rating, but still good to keep in mind though:- Device needs to hold up a big phone without tripping over, and thus is a bit on the heavy side, at almost 2.9lbs.- Unfolding and setting up the device could be a bit tricky to understand at first.- This holder only come with a charging cable. No power block included.",

T his little stand is very functional for being able to film myself and take steady product shots. I have a few complaints but none are major, and I\u2019d absolutely recommend it to others who need something affordable.A pleasant surprise was that it\u2019s also particularly nice for photographing pictures/documents straight down flat on a table/surface.My list of (minor) complaints:-it\u2019s QUITE heavy, heavier than my laptop! This is great for keeping it steady but carrying it around in my bag\u2026OOF.-you have to charge the remote and the base separately, with the same charger.-I have managed to pair the remote with my phone for the shutter, but haven\u2019t figured out how to pair it with the base to control the lights.-if I leave it in my bag folded up the buttons for the lights are still exposed so the light sometimes gets turned on in my bag.-if it\u2019s extended quite far, it does have a bit of sway/wobble noticeable in close up shots.-because the phone is ABOVE the light instead of in the middle like a ring light, the lighting doesn\u2019t work as a primary light source on a face without causing raccoon-eye shadows-the phone holder is great with a thick case but not if you have a pop socket; you\u2019llhave to remove the pop-the phone holder only adjusts (in all three dimensions) in 45 degree increments so it\u2019s sometimes tricky to achieve precise angles on some shotsOverall a great value and I\u2019m pleased with it!",

I made sure to fully charge the device and the remote before using. The device held a charge just fine, but it appears the remote control does not charge (the device itself will charge and the port will light up blue, but the remote does not charge or emit a blue light).There seems to be something very wrong with the buttons for the lights located directly on the device. On this device, the buttons cannot be pressed in, they appear to be jammed. I can sometimes get them to turn on, but it\u2019s very hit or miss. It takes a lot of finagling to get the lights to turn on and when they finally turn on, the lights will just randomly scroll through all six options over and over again like a strobe light and then turn off. Once they turn off, it\u2019s nearly impossible to get them to turn back on.",
