I seen this and bought it from Black Friday sale so it was also 30% off when I got it. I use it daily, I\u2019ve used it to film family gathering. I set it up in a corner, adjust my camera zoom and let it sit there. The small remote is a little scary at first because it so small and has the ability to get lost in the mix of things, but it also comes in handy, I can start recording and taking photos all with the remote and I can be a good amount away from my phone too.. it helped me take big group photos so no one was trying to run into the shot last minute, everything was set and ready to go. I love that it can open up to be taller and then sit nicely on my desk. It folds perfectly and it has a LED light that\u2019s comes in handy for the extra needed lighting on photos or video. It\u2019s a great buy overall!!",

Long enough, sustainable enough, not heavy, but durable indeed! You can do selfies, also there are two lights at the top. The most important thing is the batteries are chargeable for both the lights and the remote control !!!! You don't need extra button batteries, so environmental-friendly!! This is just what I want! Though it's not the cheapest, it's indeed worth the money!!! A great design! Great product!",

There are a lot of super expensive selfie stick tripods, so this is worth the price because the remote pairs easily and it's an extra long stand if you want to do stand up shots on your phone. The only thing is that it doesn't feel super sturdy since the stand is thin so that he selfie stick is light. I have not tried to extend the stick all the way while outdoors and maybe with some wind. Indoors it seems find and will not fall over. It's easy to fold and carry around. I would recommend it for travelers.",

The stick itself was great too so I just charged it (You have to charge the remote & the lights) Which I did both. After charging, I put it back into the box & waited til my birthday trip.Birthday trip comes.. Took it out of orig packaging & was just excited AF to use it! Turned on lights, started recording, taking pics w a bunch of my friends - Having a fabulous time!About 7 min in, one of the lights died out! WTF!!!! Spent nearly 10 min tryna fix it in the Lyft. Realized it wasn't gonna work when we finally got to our destination. At this point, I just tossed the damn thing! Honestly! I WANT A REPLACMENT! That was NOT cool! PERIOD!ESP on such an important day! I was really looking fwd to so many good memories but yall let me down, hard! Yeah, I'm pissed",

The first thing I look for is the weight, it has to be lightweight to carry around on my travels & this selfie stick is very light weight, then the length , it has to be long inorder to cover a broad area at the background of the scene of the photo you are taking. , & this selfie stick is 70 inch long , it has fill lights to improve lighting in dark areas & has a remote control, no need to use self timer of cellphone camera. I have tried & used many selfie sticks before ,& this one stands out. The best !!!!So grateful for having found this selfie stick at Amazon.",
