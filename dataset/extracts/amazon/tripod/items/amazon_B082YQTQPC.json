I figured it out in minutes and it connected to my bluetooth super easy. The design on this is amazing! The tripod folds tight to become a handle for selfies The remote is very very small but attaches very easy to the handle as well. The grip on the end to hold the phone folds in and makes everything compact. I would recommend this to anyone in the future.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Extendable Selfie Stick Tripod with Wireless Remote and Tripod Stand, and overall I am pleased with the product. The selfie stick is easy to deploy and can attach to virtually any size phone, making it a versatile and convenient tool for taking selfies and group photos.However, I did have some issues with the remote control. While it worked well at times, there were other instances where it seemed to have trouble pairing with my iPhone via Bluetooth. This was frustrating, as I had to resort to using the self-timer function on my phone instead.As for the tripod feature, I can see how it could be useful in certain situations, but I personally have not found much use for it. That being said, I did try it out and found it to be easy to set up and stable.Overall, while the Extendable Selfie Stick Tripod with Wireless Remote and Tripod Stand is a useful tool for taking photos on the go, it does have its limitations. The remote control can be hit or miss, and the tripod feature may not be useful for everyone. However, the selfie stick itself is sturdy and easy to use, making it a solid choice for anyone in the market for a portable selfie stick",

                "reviewText": "Not exactly as advertised. The description states that it can be rotated for horizontal or vertical photos, which is untrue. The phone mount only tilts towards you or away from you. It sucks because most Snapchat filters only work vertically. The only way to take a vertical photo is to hold the selfie stick away from you horizontally. That works as long as you do not have the stick fully extended. The top section of the pole is a little thin and kind of flimsy. It does slightly wobble if you have it fully extended and hold the stick horizontally. I had no issues pairing the stick to my phone and also had no issues taking photos. My other complaint is that the phone mount is not very deep so if you have a popsocket on the back of your phone, it will not fit the mount. Your phone can only be held at the very bottom where there are no buttons or items attached to the back of the phone. My last complaint is how hard it is to pull the phone mount open to get your phone in between the grips. It's almost a three-handed job. If you don't take selfies all the time, it's probably okay to use. If you take a lot of selfies, this thing might be a pain to use every time.",

                "reviewText": "I just received this tripod/selfie stick with remote today - didn't actually realize it came with a remote but it makes sense. It was on sale for 6.99 or 8.99 (down from about 26). I just got a new phone, the Sony Xperia 1IV and I wanted a cheap, stable, portable tripod for hikes. Since I just got it today, I haven't been able to test it in the field but I do have a couple quick first impressions.For the price of under $10, it's not bad. For $20+ it is terrible.The tripod feet are a bit short, and so if the tripod is fully extended it's not totally stable. Not ideal for long exposure shots, but considering the price I got it for I'm happy enough. If you have a heavy phone, this will be an issue. If you are in a windy environment, this will be an issue.The length of the tripod extension is really nice, a bit stiff though I imagine it will loosen over time, hopefully not too much. No portrait mode, but no one should really be using that for most cases anyway. If you're a vlogger I guess, but no one really wants to see you do that anyway so.. :PFinally, the remote. This was the reason I wrote the review, and was going to leave a lower star rating. But I decided to read the other reviews first and see.So, the remote on Android phones, at least on mine on Android 13 seems to have a bug where once paired to the phone, the remote will blank out and go into a \"connecting\" status. However, I tried restarting my phone and upon reboot the remote was actually connected right away. I opened up a photo app and tried to take a selfie, was met with a \"Front facing cam does not support zoom\" and after setting the Volume Button to \"Shutter\" the photo took.I did not test distance, nor have I tested whether this will stay long term. So, hopefully this isn't a recurring issue and is simply a first time pairing bug.With all of these cons in mind, for under $10 on sale this actually is a decent buy. As with anything, be sure to set it up at home first before expecting it to work right away in the field. Because of the remote this would have been a big hassle, but because I tested it I was able to figure out its quirks.Hopefully this review helps someone. I would not spend $20 on this product, but if your remote doesn't work try restarting your phone.",
