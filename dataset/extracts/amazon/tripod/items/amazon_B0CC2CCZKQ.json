                "reviewText": "I purchased this selfie stick to take on our anniversary trip. I wanted to get photos of us together and not just right in your face photos, I wanted photos where you could see the background behind us. This stick turned out to be perfect for that. I have a Galaxy S 20 ultra with a case and I was able to use it without removing the case. We used this both as a selfie stick and the tripod (quadpod) and it worked great! The little remote that comes with it, makes it easy to snap a picture. I didn't plan to use the lights that came with it, I mainly purchased this model for the quadpod and how compact it was when folded. However, one night we were sitting in front of a fountain with lights behind us. I took a picture and our faces had shadows on them. Then I put the lights on and took the picture again and the shadows were gone. In my opinion this selfie stick was sturdy, easy to use and not too heavy to carry around every day. I looked at a lot of selfie sticks and read a lot of reviews before deciding on this one. If you're on the fence, for the price, this is a great selfie stick. I plan to purchase a couple more as Christmas gifts!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The quality and functionality of the selfie stick/tripod is top notch. It was easy to set up, paired effortlessly to my iPhone, and delivers as promised. The tiny remote is removable from the handle/base so that it can be used for group photos without need to set a timer and hope everyone is ready! This way you can use the tripod and use either front or rear camera and capture your subject faster easier without frustration. The tripod is great for stabilization of the camera so your images come out sharp and crystal clear. The handy selfie lights have multiple options for warm or cool lights or a mixture of both. I wasn\u2019t expecting so much when I paid under $10 for this item. I recently spent over $40 on a similar product fro a competitor, and I was sadly disappointed. This selfie stick under promises and over delivers! I\u2019m ordering a few more for my family and friends to use as well. Thanks for making a quality product at an amazingly low price!!!",

                "reviewText": "Really nice selfie stick. It is light weight and easy to use. Easy to connect to the Bluetooth clicker. The lights are really nice and it has alot of different options for color and intensity. Even dim they give off a good amount of light. Easy to hold even when fully extended. The only consequence I find is the fact that it is only for a phone and can not be switched with different attachments to hold other somewhat cameras. I'm not feeling the comfort of secure to fit my camera to the selfie stick. The tension on the clips are difficult to open if you have a phone case on your phone. It's not so easily done especially to turn or adjust. The tripod base is not as wide as I had hope for either.",
