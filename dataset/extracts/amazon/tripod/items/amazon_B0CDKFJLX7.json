                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars This is the tripod for everyone, including but not limited to Bigfoot and Mini-Me.",
                "reviewText": "TLDR: High quality, sturdy, extremely modular and transformable. Great price. Buy now. There's literally no reason you should keep reading, just cough it up already.LONG VERSION:Discovery- I found this tripod on YouTube, searching for the right one to use with my phone and an external mic. I came across this one, looked at the reviews/pictures, and decided to purchase it. I couldn't have made a better decision when it comes to choosing the right tripod for my needs, which, for you good Christian mothers out there, involves nature shots, camping videos, and nothing of the adult variety. Call me.Packaging- The tripod and accessories came in their own bag, covered in plastic, within a \"show box\" (standard advertising box for items with labels, etc.),, looking very sexy, which was within an Amazon box filled with plastic air packing pads. The item arrived safely and shipping only took 2-3 days, despite it being the holidays.The Bag- High quality, durable, simple as your Alabamian cousin. Zipper works perfectly. It's a bag.What's in the Bag?- Well, I'm glad you asked! The tripod itself, along with a camera attachment/accessory, a phone attachment/accessory, and a small plastic bag containing small wrenches for the legs. There was also air in the bag. Smells pretty good honestly. Like a new tripod bag. Not like your finger, which you need to keep to yourself.The Tripod- Relatively lightweight. Not indestructible (otherwise it wouldn't be light as adamantium is very heavy), but very durable, strong and steady. Very modular and multipurpose. The leg with the soft grip and brand name on it can be unscrewed and, with the center pole that it attaches to (or the camera attachment itself) can be screwed back together to form a selfie stick, which you can stick yourself with, separate from the legs and joint. The branded pole with the grip has a 3/8\" male thread, which would also fit any other attachments purchased and meant for that size, which gives you even more options. Ladies. ;) This tripod is a MONSTER when it comes to its ability to transform, which is one of biggest reasons I bought it. Frankly, it's nuts. I'm nuts. You're nuts. Your nuts. Let's talk about those later. As stated above, it can go from a tripod to a sole selfie stick. It can also EXTEEEEENNNDDD, all the way from a small, portable table top tripod, to the advertised height of 80\", which is crazy. It's like you took a regular tripod and gave it those pills you bought from your Gmail spam folder. You can get some great shots from that view. Good luck seeing through your viewfinder though, unless you're Yao Ming or a gymnast who does couples geometry . This could also be helpful in a situation where your body is at a higher elevation, say on a hill or a rock, where there's no room for the tripod, only in front of you, at a lower elevation. The opposite is also possible if you retract the legs while your body is at a lower elevation, say... Looking through your window at the undressing grandmother across the street while projectile vomiting onto the tenant below you in your apartment complex. The legs can be individually adjusted at three extension points, and one angle point, which features a spring-loaded clip that is very easy to use, and is capable of clipping at three notch points, or moving up and over all of them to fold the legs up towards the top of the tripod for storage. The legs are metal and durable, but I wouldn't slam them over my knee and spank them anytime soon, as they're obviously hollow metal, and will bend severely. As long as you don't do that, you shouldn't have to be too careful. That's a good tripod. The extension grips are solid, smooth, and easy to loosen or tighten. They have rubber grips, which prevent your hands from slipping. Some of you may be able to compare that with a kink of yours. The feet of the legs are soft yet durable rubber, which pop off to reveal smaller metal feet, which can be pierced into the ground in order to plant the tripod in a natural environment, or used to fend off a wild, feral human. I will also note that the rubber feet enable you to save your poor hardwood floor from unwanted abuse, unlike your second wife. The clips on the leg extensions are very strong and tight, like a man's dominant hand grip. The camera mount has a 3/8\" female thread on its bottom, unlike the second asshole the government has torn you. This accessory has a circular level for finding a straight shot according to gravity. Just keep a fair distance from your mom when measuring. The attachment also has a ball at the top, so you can turn and angle the camera in almost any direction, much like your sexuality in college. Don't worry, we all go through experimental phases of some sort. The ball can be tightened and locked in place (guys, I'm sorry) with one of the plastic screws on the side. The top of this attachment also (obviously) has a camera mount with another screw for tightening. The phone attachment is solid plastic but durable and basic. The part that grips onto your phone has rubber contact feet to keep your baby nice and new, along with a foam backplate to protect it's perfect, smooth, oily backside. There is a screw on the back to lock the rotation. This attachment features a 1/4\" thread hole on the bottom AND top, leaving you with the option of mounting an external mic or light. Now, you may be asking, \"how do I fit the phone attachment with a 1/4\" thread hole onto the tripod's 3/8 thread?\", \"how did I get this disease?\", \"what're my treatment options?\", \"how will this affect my loved ones?\"... Well, we here at the Amazon Friendship and Review Coalition are here to help. You see that male thread protruding from the top of the tripod after taking the camera attachment off? Well, that grippy circular thingymabobber under it is what you have to use to unscrew the thread itself. That's right; it's threaded on both ends, and guess what's on the other side? A 1/4\" thread! Ho-ly! Now, you flip that over, screw it back in with that grippy circular thing with a hex fitting that the thread drops into, and BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE! You have a 1/4\" thread! I assure you that that is not below average my friend. Trust me. Because I said so. Now, you screw the phone attachment on, and you're all set to shoot a bedroom escapade.This concludes our review and we return you to our regularly scheduled program; Debby Does Dallas.",

                "reviewText": "This was the perfect purchase by someone who had no clue what to look for in a tripod. I am not a professional photographer and had never been close to a tripod in my life. It has exceeded expectations I didn't know I had until I began to use it. My husband and I are getting on in years and sometimes taking pictures is a challenge on shaky hands days. We've purchased several Olympus Stylus digital cameras (point and shoot and let the camera figure out how to give us a good picture). We needed the zoom feature to take our wildlife photos from our home and deck. A little tremble with a big zoom equates to a major shake...hence the desire for a stable holder for the camera. The tripod was very easy to assemble and I confess I did not use the instructions which looked a little intimidating. I used no tools, not even the allen wrench that was included. Someday I'll look and see what it is supposed to do but I have everything working that I need. I simply unfolded the legs and used the little turn knobs on each of the three legs to get the height I wanted. Love the range for height! I'm 5'5\" and husband is nearly 6'. It is ideal for us both. Twisted the camera onto the little screw on the removable platform, tightened the platform on top of the tripod and was ready to use it. There are two easy adjustments that allow the platform holding the camera to move in a steady and controlled fashion if your target isn't inclined to sit still and smile. We've caught eagles, deer and other animals moving at a clip and at a distance. Shots we missed before we now get most of the time. The platform holding the camera can be quickly removed if you need to grab the camera and run without the tripod. The tripod is attractive enough to leave set up all the time and is a great conversation piece. Everyone who sees it wants to take a picture. Other nice features are that it is lightweight but very, very sturdy. It has a nice travel case. It has another attachment with a larger screw that may be meant for something that needs a larger screw to attach than our Stylus' need. All in all it looks more expensive than it is.",

                "reviewText": "I was a retired short file maker using this tripod for making home movie and documenting my work around the house. In stead of large pro video cameras I am now only using DSLR and iPhone for this hobby. This tripod works with these cameras very well. It is very easy to carry around, in and out of the car, up and down my desert alleyway, with the added benefit of the monopod feature. However, because the whole setup is very light, you want to make sure extra weights, such as rocks or bag of stuff, are added to the tripod center so it is not easily blown away or tipped over by gusty wind. For those who have heavy cameras or oversize lenses, this will not fit. For everyone else, this is a great value for what it is capable of.",

Super smooth motion, locks in tight, legs are sturdy, and adjusts to every height that I've ever needed it for. It's the only tripod (of the 5 that I own) that is 80\" tall, and sometimes wish my other ones were that tall also. Occasionally I have to switch what I'm doing to use this one cuz it's the tallest. I don't have a heavy camera, only my cell phones, but this suits my needs. I bought and have used 5 different brands to compare, and I would definitely recommend this or any Mactrem. (Get the extra tall, you won't be disappointed.)",
