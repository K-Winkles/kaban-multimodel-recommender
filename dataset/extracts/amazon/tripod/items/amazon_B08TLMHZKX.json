                "reviewText": "Ok this actually is very nice and well put together, the only thing and the reason why my over all rating is a 4 and not a 5 star is that there is no swivel head or any way of turning one of the support arms.You have to turn the hole stand to get your camera in position and if the wind is blowing in a direction that you don't have an actual leg to give proper resistance on this stand to prevent it from being blown over you have no choice but to choose a different spot to take pictures or to record video.I am glad I have a different stand for my actual camera for outdoor conditions that might have wind as I wouldn't trust my $800.00 Canon camera on this stand if there was any wind outside, but other then that I really do like this stand.The holder for the phone is great, it actually has a very firm grip on my phone, and it is very light weight so great for doing selfies and even doing videos while you are walking and holding onto this stand as a selfie wand. I would suggest this for anyone and even would buy it again if ever I needed another one.",

I own an Olmpus Stylus camera which is no longer made so I was concerned that it might not fit onto the tripod screw. It fit perfectly and I love the product.,However I am confused about 1 thing.It is advertised as an iphone tripod and I intended to use both my camera and my iphone but there was no where on the tripod to secure my phone. I had to go back onto Amazon and order a separate Iphone holder accessory that screws into the top of the tripod. Perhaps if I had known that to be the case I might have chosen a tripod that met all of my needs",

My only complaint is the feet don\u2019t spread very far apart therefore it\u2019s not very stable when a phone is attached and is telescoped to its tallest. We had it set up to take a photo of my wife and I and a gust of wind blew it over cracking my phone (thankfully it was only the screen saver).Should only be used on a flat surface in very calm conditions.",
