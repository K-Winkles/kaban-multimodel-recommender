It also comes with a Bluetooth remote, so you can snap photos from further away and not have to actually touch your phone to do so. iPhone holder expands from 2.3\u201d to 5.3 inches so it allows for phones that have extra wide or thick covers. The 15 inch gooseneck allows for getting the perfect angle and the 180\u00b0 rotation head allows for easy up-and-down motion. It also has nonslip rubber feet to keep the tripod in place, and it fits into a standard screw for cameras and ring lights as well. If you would like to add additional features, it has a quick flip lock that adjust the height easily, and a base backing knob to secure the footing, it also comes in a very nice caring bag to keep all of your pieces together .",
