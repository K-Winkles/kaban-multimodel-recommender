The spindle coming off the ball joint is 1/8 to 1/4 inch injection molded plastic. I will now be looking for something more robust.I wanted to take video of my golf swing. This thing is so light and small I can just keep it in my bag. Time for a little self diagnosis. Just snap the phone in and wrap the flexible legs of the tripod around the handle of the bag, aim and shoot. You can\u2019t snap the phone into portrait mode but you can swivel it 90 degrees on the ball joint of the tripod head. For me, a very cost effective and portable way to stabilize a camera phone.",

We'll see how long they hold up.-From legs to ball joint, there is no rotation and only one horizontal gap to lower phone bracket into. Basically, if you use the phone perpendicular to the legs, there is only one orientation for the legs to be (2 in front, 1 in back). Not a huge deal, but lowers versatility a bit when clamping to monitor or other post besides desktop sitting.Overall, feels light and cheap, but is an extremely versatile phone stand for $7 that gets the job done.",

                "reviewText": "I thought these were going to be great and versatile. The legs seem to be. They could be longer, to wrap around larger posts, tree trunks/branches, etc\u2026and still get any low angle. What\u2019s the point if the materials are so inferior as to make the tripod unusable in a short time. Wish I had read the reviews. I usually do. I think I confused these with another brand in a rush purchase. I bought two.First, before a month was out, with just simple phone use at home, the very cheap, soft plastic stem of the ball head snapped off, rendering the phone holder useless. iPhone 13 Pro Max with Defender case. It was not holding it tight enough. Too many accidental tilt downs, and the stem would loosen frequently, so I tried to tighten both the head and attachment disc. Once I did, and I tried to swivel from landscape to portrait, it was finally tight enough, and simply snapped as I turned. Then I had an extra pair of legs.The second tripod suffered the ball head tightening itself. The metal bolt stripped the nut embedded in the plastic, so it won\u2019t tighten anymore, just a few weeks after the other break. I switched everything around to try to make one good tripod again, vowing to be careful with tightening and swiveling. The other nut stripped immediately. You can see in the pictures how far it will tighten, and how far the bolt is Not sticking out of the nut. Now they are both essentially useless\u2026 Garbage.Would be really nice to get my money back.I\u2019d give more stars for the legs, but why bother?They\u2019re there to hold something. If they can\u2019t\u2026DON\u2019T BUY THIS PRODUCT!",
