I have mostly been using stuff for mobile photography and this is the first thing I have picked up for my full size camera. This is an extremely nice tripod and very sturdy. The carbon fiber makes it so much lighter than my already light aluminum tripods. Its built very well and works great.",

                "reviewText": "This tripod is a great option if you're looking for something versatile and lightweight. This is an excellent product for traveling, outdoors usage, or to keep in your car for spontaneous shoots. I'm 5'10 and the fully extended height on this tripod is a little bit short for me if I intend to look through the viewfinder but works out great if I'm shooting tethered or using the rotating LCD screen on my camera to compose. Obviously I can also just bend down a bit but if it's a longer shoot, I don't prefer that as it's taxing on my spine. As I said though, it's a great option for on the go as it's super lightweight. This thing feels about half the weight of a similarly sized non-carbon fiber tripod I often carry. I love that the center column can be reversed for low angle shooting and one of the legs can be removed to be used as a monopod. The versatility of this design alone is well worth the money. The folded size of this tripod makes it a great addition to a backpack or tucked into a rolling case but I prefer to keep mine under the seat in my car so that I have it when I need it. It's not going to replace the heavy duty, tall and rock solid monsters I like to use in my studio but I think this SmallRig tripod is destined to be my go-to when I'm on the go.",

                "reviewText": "This is my second SmallRig tripod because their carbon fiber smaller travel tripods are excellent, no-fail pieces of kit. This tripod is no exception as it is a well-thought out set-up for still photographers. The ballhead, while small, is perfectly matched for lighter setups. I use this one when I have about a 6-7 pound camera and lens and can't be using the car to carry my heavy Gitzo. This is one is great for hiking out to a site and then setting it up. The legs locks are ver secure although I prefer twist to lever locks. Nonetheless they do not slip or slide. It folds up nicely so that it can be carried strapped to a camera backpack or messenger bag. The QR system is ARCA-Swiss compatible so I can use all my cages for SMallRig and other companies, no need going to a Manfrotto system. The ball head doesn't seize on lockdown and I can crank it to be super solid. I have great faith in it as well, using it to carry my rig and throwing the tripod over my shoulder as I walk to a new location. SmallRig makes great, well-engineered stuff. In a choice between SmallRig and other video gear companies, I always go SmallRig.",

                "reviewText": "I think that the most interesting thing about this tripod is that they went with the detachable monopod, but also decided to use lever latches for the leg extensions. I almost always see twist locks for this mechanism just because you don't have to worry about the levers lining up on the outside after you spin the monopod leg on. I still don't know how it works so well, but the leg always stops right with the locks lined up facing outward. It's a great design.The levers are also don't stick out very far, so I don't have to worry about my cords getting snagged on them. The legs slide up and down about as well as I've come to expect out of carbon fiber. It's not as smooth as aluminum, but it's much lighter, and very strong.The weight hook is spring loaded, so it can be pulled out to hold a sandbag, or left up to also reduce the possibility of snagging wires. I also find this to be handy to use as a way of clamping wires if I want to hold them in place.The whole thing is very light, and even the bag has fairly thick cord so it doesn't bite into your hand if you want to carry it around for a long period of time.The feet are removable in the event I want to swap them with metal spikes, and the ball head has full articulation with a slight drag to help get smooth feeling moving shots.Overall a great tripod.Highly recommended.",
