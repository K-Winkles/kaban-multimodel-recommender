                "reviewText": "My last iPad stand had plastic on collars that tightened around the shaft to keep the sections of the stand in place. These broke very quickly. I purchased this one because it had the snap closure to hold the stand section. I was concerned that it didn\u2019t hold my iPad like the previous stand but the rubber no slip portions of the stand really hold my iPad securely unless it is knocked completely over",
