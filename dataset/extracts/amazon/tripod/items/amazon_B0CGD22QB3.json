                "reviewText": "I have been using this a lot lately for my Holiday season social media recording. It has serious range for height and device positioning. It even has a hook for counterweights. The remote helps for controlling your device once in position, and I absolutely love that it comes with a carrying case with shoulder strap for easier transport. The legs adjust individually, so if you need one shorter or longer for an uneven surface prop, you can do that. It has multiple position tightening spots so you can angle your camera or ipad or phone in any number of configurations. I haven't tried the upside down for overhead recording but it may be able to do so, but not sure. The mounts fit with a thick case without problems, however I do run into problems with my popsocket holder in the way. That is not this equipment's fault but it would be nice if the holder grips were a little longer to make up for so many people who use those.",

It is stable and has a lot of adjust ability. There are a good amount of attachments in the carrying bag. Its a decent stand for a light camera.I received this via the Amazon vine program.My opinions are my own and weren't influenced by anyone.",

                "reviewText": "This is a decent camera tripod for the price. It has lots of great features to support cell phone camera users which I really like. It is fairly easy to set up out of the bag but I do have some complaints with this (discuss later.) The tripod is very sturdy and secure once the locks are engaged and the clamps tightened. Thread the head onto the tripod and we are largely ready to go. The quick-release plate comes off to make installing our phone onto it or adjusting placement easier. Just stretch the clamp and slide the phone in. There are levels both on the head and tripod which make it very simple to align properly. I like how we can adjust the head to many different angles which makes getting great shots a breeze. The bag is a disappointment and I shall purchase a replacement soon. Why have a bag made that does not fit the assembled product? We cannot leave the feet or head installed on the tripod and insert it in the bag. This greatly increases the likelihood we will lose the parts removed. On the tripod, the Center column lift rocker feels somewhat flimsy but it gets the job done. One of my bigger frustrations is the rotary handle fastening nut falls out easily (the rotary handle threads into it.) There is a notch the nut sits in but for some reason, it is not secured in place. I leave the handle installed to prevent it from falling out. This product does work well once put together and I would recommend it for cell phone photographers to get experience with.",
