It does do that well \u2014 see accompanying pictures. Not sure what angle it is though.Again, great purchase. I *highly* recommend it for quick video calls at your desk, vlogging, etc.",

Sturdiness - the legs are thin and take work to get the stand set up, especially with the weight of the phone and case. I worry if I touch the phone once it\u2019s propped, it will fall.- But that sleek design is what makes it more compact and it folds up very fast. Easy to store in a purse or even wristlet.2. It doesn\u2019t extend at all. Which is find for my needs. But, due to the sturdiness issue it would be hard to prop it up on things as well. The surface has to be leveled.- On a positive note, it swivels and the clamp holds the phone tightly.It\u2019s a good tripod and well made, but if you\u2019re needing something more sturdy or for lots of repositioning, this wouldn\u2019t be the one.",

                "reviewText": "I needed just a simple tripod to go on my desk on the counter to hold my phone upright and this checked all the boxes. You can have it landscape vertical it goes up and down and the folds up super small and compact. It's perfect for filming videos, watching videos on my phone, having facetime calls. It's easy to throw in my purse and car to take on the go. I have used it actually a lot more than I thought and have really liked just having a stand for my phone! I have used this product for a few weeks now and really like it! Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I use this for web meetings on my phone and it's just the right tool for that. I can't speak to using it as a selfie stick, though by inspection, I'll wager it would be okay. Really, I think this is best as a tripod.I have a thicker and heavier phone that most because I use an extended battery pack (Motorola moto Z4 with the Turbo Power battery pack) and a bumper guard. The grip wings hold the phone well and the tilt doesn't slip.Some others have remarked that the unit breaks when it is extended. As with anything you get, it you are rough with it, it will break. Extending the stand easily, but firmly, is the best way to set it up for use.I don't think it is a solution for everything, but as a desk stand for a phone or a small tripod for a camera, it's a fine tool.",

                "reviewText": "At first, this tripod made me angry because it came folded up and for some reason, mine was incredibly stiff and difficult to unfold. I actually broke my nail from opening the phone holder part.I also don\u2019t like that it doesn\u2019t angle. So you have to adjust yourself and the height of the phone on this device to get yourself in view.This tripod does not like phone cases. Especially not if you have a larger iPhone version. Super pain that I have to take my case off every time to use this.For such a small and simple tripod, this should not have made me as frustrated as it did.Now the upside is, I like the adjustable height and once my phone case is off, this thing works great and fairly sturdy.I do still have a bit of an issue when it\u2019s folded up. Maybe I got one that\u2019s difficult to open or something. I can\u2019t imagine every reviewer had this same experience.",

                "reviewText": "This is a handy little tripod to keep with you for some on the spot picture taking selfies. It folds up to a short little tube and it is easy to open and set up. I have an iPhone 12 Pro and it fits ok in this, although it really is better built for the smaller phone. It isn't heavy to carry with you and quick to use. I use my watch as a remote shutter and its a breeze! Worth it!",
