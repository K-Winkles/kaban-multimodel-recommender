                "reviewText": "Purchased my first one in Jan 2019 and loved it so much that I bought a second one that September for my other GoPro. These are lightweight, easy to carry/pack and feels sturdy. One of my favorite pieces of gear for recording car events and my GoPro's live on these mounts. Convenient and easy to use as a handheld monopod for recording as I walk, but can easily convert to a low mount tripod on the ground, wrap around the roof rack of my car, tree's, posts, wherever for higher vantage points. This provides so much versatility to allow me to get the camera at just the right place for shots. This does not replace the need for a regular height tripod, but I definitely use this more often than my standard tripod and it takes up so much less space.I suspect this wouldn't be great for full body cameras(dslr's for example) because the weight may be more than you would want on the mount, but for small, lightweight action cameras, this is a miracle device. Personally, I would not trust my Canon DSLR on this tripod, but to be fair I've never tested it(and I won't).If you are looking for an easy to use mount for your phone, action camera or other small/lightweight camera, this is a great product that I would definitely recommend. Comes with a mount adapter for a GoPro as well as your standard screw mount and an inexpensive squeeze mount for a phone. If you have a large phone the included phone mount may be a close fit, and it is a pretty cheap phone mount, but it would do the job in a pinch. All in all, great product for the price that I will continually replace them with the same item for as long as it's available, if they ever break.",

Needless to say, I had to learn to trust it's strength and go with the flow.-the tripod seems almost alien like something off a sci-fi movie, it's cool.Just buy it, you will not regret it.",

I needed something I could mount (temporarily) to my mailbox that would keep the camera steady while I recorded. This worked perfectly for that purpose and was able to wrap around the top of the mailbox post and conform to the shape easily. I also own a Nikon DSLR with a fairly large/heavy lens. While I wouldn't use this in a fully upright position with that camera rig, I did test it with the legs pretty well \"splayed out\" and it kept the camera and lens upright and steady enough that I'd be comfortable using this in certain situations that called for a tripod but where I didn't have my full-sized one handy. The additional gear it came with to allow use of a smartphone was a nice bonus and might also come in handy.",

                "reviewText": "After doing a lot of research and watching many video reviews on YouTube I chose to purchase this tripod over the most popular flexible ball-jointed tripod and many other tripods. This is a very well constructed tripod made with silicone and is very grippy --including the feet! Due to the fact that it does not have ball joints it grips closely and tightly to railings, tree branches, backs of chairs, and countless number of other things! Because of the aluminum support bars inside it gives this tripod strength to hold any SLR camera. It has a 360 degree adjustable ball head and holds my Sony A6000 with no trouble at all! The above picture is how I set up my Patekfly tripod and my Sony A6000 in order to capture snowflakes as they gently settle on my windowsill, or float in and land on my black scarf.I also bought this tripod as a gift for my daughter, and as soon as my niece (who also loves photography) saw this tripod she immediately went online and quickly ordered it on Amazon! You won't regret purchasing this tripod! I would love it if Patekfly came out with other versions of this tripod...one with a level attached to it, as well as a much taller version that you could use in order to stand in streams of water to take photos of waterfalls, etc. (Hint, hint). It also comes with a free 18 month warranty! What are you waiting for! Purchase yours today! You won't be disappointed!",

                "reviewText": "Tripod is very flexible (quite literally) and incredibly versatile. I used it to take time lapse of driving from my passenger seat. I used it to take photos with my DSLR.Two negatives I noticed:1. The twist on mechanism for DSLR or phone unwinds more often than I would like reducing stability. Perhaps it's related to the weight of my phone and DSLR.2. Sometimes I find myself photographing from awkward angles due to the short length of the tripod.Despite the negatives, it was a very worthwhile purchase and I don't regret the purchase at all.",

                "reviewText": "This little tripod is great! I have only had it for a week, but It seems like it will be very durable. I am using a Canon EOS Rebel with it, with a closeup lens. It holds the weight just fine. I have tried using it wrapped around a tree branch just to see if it worked the way the product information indicated, and it did. The material this tripod is made of feels like a kind of rubber, and it clung to the branch very well. I now have it in a window so that I can photograph birds, and it practically sticks to the window sill, and can be made narrow enough to fit there. The legs of the tripod are very flexible so that it can be made shorter or taller by bending them. Well worth the price I paid for it.",

                "reviewText": "I was hesitating on whether to buy Patekfly or Gorillapod, but decided to give this one a try because of the good reviews. I was a little disappointed with the mechanical design of this tripod (the tilt and the fastening functions felt not very sturdy), but as long as I triple checked the camera was safely attached to the tripod, I was okay with it... until the legs became wobbly and not standing at all after 10 days of purchase. #ripSo I requested a return, and got a \"pre-paid label\" that was actually not even pre-paid (lol) and it seems like I can't even get a tracking number for that package #double_rip. In a nutshell, just buy the gorilla pod - seems like it's the best standard option for mini tripods for now. Peace",
