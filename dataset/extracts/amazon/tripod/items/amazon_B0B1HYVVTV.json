If you have additional requirements, you can choose according to the actual situation. 2.What is the difference between carbon fiber tripod and aluminum tripod? For the same size tripod,carbon fiber will weigh about 30% less than aluminum alloy, and its strength will be higher, and it will not rust. But the value is also higher. 3.How to choose the tripod loading capacity? You can choose according to the weight of camera and lens, for example your equipment is 2kg, it is suggested to choose the tripod bearing above 4kg. 4.What is the difference between the twist lock and the lever lock? The structure of the twist lock is simple, easy to replace parts, disassemble, clean and maintain. The lever lock opens faster and is easy to operate with one hand. Can other gimbal be installed? Yes, any gimbal with a 3/8-inch port on the bottom is compatible.",

                "reviewText": "Overall very pleased with this tripod. Pretty easy to use once you get the hang of what all the knobs and levers do. Minor gripes which knock it down to 4 stars for me:1) In the product I received, the hex/allen head bolts which secure the legs to the center of the tripod had a bunch of tiny extremely sharp burrs on them. I kept getting little slices cut into my hands the first couple times I used the tripod, and it took me a while to figure out the source. I used a Dremel tool to clean up the surface of those bolt heads, and all is good now. But buyers should be aware of this hazard.2) The bubble level on the tripod head is fairly useless. It is heavily biased toward the center. So as long as you're within 5-10\u00ba or so of horizontal, it reads as if you are actually level. I was hoping I'd be able to use the level to quickly get set up on uneven terrain, but it really isn't helpful.Aside from those two issues, I've found the tripod to be quite secure and useful so far!",

                "reviewText": "I don't use a tripod very often, so can't justify investing in an expensive one, but I did already have a good quality ball head. I found that tripods that don't already come with ball-heads are high-end and cost more than I was looking to spend and most of the inexpensive tripods come with heads that either aren't removable or used non-standard connections. The head on this tripod is removable and uses a standard 3/8\" threaded head mount, so I was able to easily swap heads. There is also a fairly flimsy feeling plastic weight clip on the bottom of the tripod, but it turns out that also uses a standard 3/8\" thread that is easy to swap with a sturdier spring-loaded metal option (plenty of choices available on Amazon). I think the out-of-the box components will meet most people's needs just fine, but hopefully it's helpful to know that you are able to swap parts out if you find you want to make some upgrades in the future.",

                "reviewText": "It took me a bit to get oriented to how to use this tripod as it works a little differently to the usual \"standard\" tripods I've had in the past, especially in regard to unfolding the legs. The design allows it to fold up really compact for how tall of a tripod it is and it feels solid. My only complaint is that there is no quick release function to snap the camera into the tripod, you have to manually screw and unscrew the quick attach bracket on the bottom of the camera in and out of the tripod to take it on and off. I wish it just had the usual lever to lock it in and out of the tripod, but otherwise it's a great tripod.",
