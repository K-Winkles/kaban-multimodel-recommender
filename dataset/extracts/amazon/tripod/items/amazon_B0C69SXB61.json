It's evident that great care and detail went into making this product.The bendable legs are a standout feature. They not only offer unparalleled flexibility but also serve as a perfect grip for a wide array of objects, from strollers and cribs to numerous other surfaces. Additionally, these legs can be adjusted to function as a handy grip, providing an easy and comfortable handheld option for my on-the-go shooting needs.Most importantly, it accommodates my iPhone 13 Mini flawlessly. The secure fitment ensured that I never once feared my phone would fall out. The secure hold puts any worries about device safety at ease, allowing me to focus solely on capturing the best shots.Overall, I highly recommend the UBeesize Flexible Tripod. Whether you're a casual user or a photography enthusiast, you'll appreciate the quality, flexibility, and reliability that this tripod offers. It's not just a tripod; it's a game-changer in mobile photography.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this as a convenient way to position my iPhone when shooting cute little videos for my friends and family. Set it on a desktop, tabletop, dresser, or any flat surface, and it serves that purpose perfectly. Combining that with the fact it is the most economically priced unit of its kind and what else is there to say? Unless you NEED something fancier or bigger (if you don't that you do, you don't) buy it.When I make a purchase on Amazon, I always check the lowest reviews first. If 75% of people give it five stars and 1% gives it one star, I read the one star reviews first.Many of the low reviews I saw on this product bemoaned the fact that it doesn't come with assembly instructions.People, there are FOUR pieces.So allow me to offer a quick tutorial since it does not in fact come with assembly instructions in much the same way chewing gum doesn't come with an insert that says, \"1. Remove wrapper 2. Chew gum.\"The first part is the tripod, it is the largest part, it has legs. You want the legs to point down. At the non-leg end is the mounting platform. It is flat, platform shaped, and has a small threaded bolt sticking up from the center of it, hinting that in the near future you will be screwing something on to it. On the side of the unit is a big, friendly, easy-to-turn knob. Loosen it (turn to the left) and the mounting platform moves in many exciting directions. Tighten it (turn to the right) and platform is locked in place. Experiment, until you find the direction that works for you.The next part is the remote control. It looks like a remote control with buttons and everything. It is for controlling things, remotely. Set it aside for now.The next part is a mounting bracket for a GoPro style camera. If you've never seen one, this might be confusing (and you probably don't need it.) A simple rule of thumb, \"Is there any conceivable way this attaches to my phone?\" If the answer is no, set it aside. For the curious, it has a base with a threaded hole in it, and three black plastic tabs, evenly spaced, with a single long screw running through the center of all three. The case for your GoPro style camera will have TWO tabs on the bottom, usually clear, and these are meant to interlock with the plastic tabs on the base, at which point the long screw is inserted through ALL the tabs and tightened down (remember, to the right) to hold your camera firmly in place.The final piece is the spring-loaded camera bracket. Find the threaded hole in the base of it. Screw it on to the threaded bolt sticking up from the top of your tripod mounting platform until it is snug (righty-tighty.) Congratulations, your tripod is assembled.The bracket has two \"jaws\" that fold down flat for easy storage. Flip them into the \"ready for grabbin\" position, so that they are at a 90 degree angle (or perpendicular as I like to say) to the piece you just flipped them up from. If you apply pressure to these \"jaws\" as though you were trying to move them away from each other, you will find that the unit is spring loaded, the jaws move apart, wide enough to accommodate vary sizes of phone. Stick your phone in there. Well done.There ARE instructions included for pairing the remote to your phone. This is very handy as it allows you to remotely activate either the video or photo function on your phone.Personally, I assume my instructions are unnecessary. I believe that you, dear potential purchaser, can (as I did) look at it for 10 seconds and figure it out. If not, I hope my instructions prove useful. If not, there is a clearly visible tab on your \"order page\" for the product labeled \"GET CUSTOMER SUPPORT.\" They have a support button for a product that any 8 year old who hasn't been eating paint chips for a few years could assemble.So really, dinging a product like this for \"not including instructions\" is just...well, I probably can't use the word I'd like to so let's just say it's unnecessary and more than a little petty.And if you ARE one of those people who felt you needed to lower your rating because it didn't come with an 8.5x11 glossy manual with supplemental color photos and a support animal please remember, take the wrapper off FIRST, THEN chew the gum, not the other way around.For everyone else, it doesn't cost much, it works just fine, it's probably EXACTLY what you're looking for. I'm certainly satisfied with it.Thank you, and good night.",

                "reviewText": "It definitely has a delicate cheap feeling to it. So I handled it very carefully when testing it out. Installing of the phone holder was easy. Connecting with the remote was easy. Remote feels even cheaper. So delicate hands when pushing the buttons! I wanted this kind of tripod because of its bendable legs. Planning to use it out in the woods and we'll see how it holds up and distance wise for the remote. What I noticed about the remote is that, you have to click it once to wake it up. Then click again to take a picture. If you want to take a video, simply hold down the button. Letting go will end the recording. Very simple to figure out. I didn't even need to read the instructions. The phone holder itself, I accidentally pulled it apart, but it didn't break. Easy to put it back in place. Again, delicate hands needed! Force is very unnecessary. Will update after testing it in the woods.Update: works perfect fine for me! Love it so much! It was exactly what I was looking for",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Flexible Tripod with Quick-Release Plate for Camera and Cellphone, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for my vlogging and video recording needs. This mini tripod stand is not only compatible with smartphones, GoPros, and webcams, but it also comes with a remote and clip, making it incredibly versatile. The quick-release plate is a handy feature that allows for easy and secure attachment of my camera or cellphone. The flexible legs are sturdy and can be adjusted to various angles, allowing for creative shots and stable footage. Overall, I highly recommend this tripod for anyone looking to up their video recording game. It's compact, reliable, and offers great value for the price.",
