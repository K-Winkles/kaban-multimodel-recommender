The price was only five bucks it's hard to beat something like this. it's not real heavy duty but I think it will work for what most people want. I'm going to do some family photos and maybe a little outdoor work and I actually bought a second one for my children. When a price on something is reduced you become a little suspicious. And it might be that it is a fairly lightweight item but if you're carrying it in a backpack and you want something that will extend about five feet up and stand on its own tripod it's just right. Everything worked is it I hoped it would. The Bluetooth Link initially said I needed an app but I did not. After a couple of minutest it linked. the video worked great and snapshots were very good. I set it about 30 ft from me and it still took a video and good photos. so the distance wasn't a problem. it might even go further than that. I'll find out when I go outside",

My only complaint is that the remote control is not connected to the selfie stick so unfortunately it fell out of its slider and got lost. So it was only good for part of one trip.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m just gonna start this review with disclosing that I bought this tripod for when I\u2019m doing unholy things that my grandpa wouldn\u2019t approve of and recording them to share with other people like my mom taught me not to do.Now that that\u2019s out of the way.The pros:- it\u2019s cheap!- the button works.- the light is bright.- the light is rechargeable.- it\u2019s strong enough to hold my phone with a case on it (which has been a struggle with phone mounts in the past).- it\u2019s strong enough that I can put the bottom inch of my phone in the clamp and it doesn\u2019t tip or fall.- it\u2019s LONG.Cons:- i wish the remote snapped into the handle or something. I already know it\u2019s gonna get lost if I take it somewhere lol- I didn\u2019t take points off for this but I wish the legs of the tripod were longer. *it\u2019s my own fault because I had it sitting on the squishy couch but* it it\u2019s not sturdy on soft surfaces and ends up falling over.- I didn\u2019t take points off for this either but I wish the light had more settings than just bright & brighter. Some lights have the warm/cool light options which would be nice.- it\u2019s HARD to get it to telescope. I\u2019m scared I\u2019m gonna break it. It\u2019s also really difficult to rotate the pole.- idk how long the battery on the remote works?Overall, I would recommend this. It seems like a great product for its value.",
