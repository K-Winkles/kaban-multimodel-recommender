                "reviewText": "I ordered this in May 2020 and all this time later I still use it daily for astrophotography. It's compact and lightweight but will get surprisingly tall when you extend it to its full length. I've brought it with me hiking up hills/mountains and when I'm not using it as a hiking stick it's less cumbersome than my camera (which isn't even heavy). It's variable leg lengths are great for awkward terrain and its grippy feet keep it planted. Now for the negatives, it's not very heavy so it will get shaken by the wind easily, though I've never had it tip over even with top heavy cameras. On the topic of heavy cameras, my Canon 2000D is front heavy so if you loosen the ball head the camera will fall forward. Also when I'm zoomed in at 42X, like I am when I take pictures of Venus, the ball head can be grippy. Like when I try to move my framing over it will jump further than I wanted it too. One time the ball head got stuck in place a while ago and I had a tough time loosening it, but I've never had a problem since. All in all it's a perfect travel tripod. Works great for DSLRs, works even better for phones. You would have a tough time using something as big as a telescope on it, so in that case you would want a heavier tripod.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for an inexpensive tripod and at $68 I'm overall satisfied with this tripod two years after purchase.Issues after two years of heavy use:- two of the legs not having strong latch at the top of the leg/near the central body. When new it was very stable but now I have to angle the legs juuust right to feel tight against the body.-The locking rings on one of the legs isn't very strong anymore and the leg will slide if I rock the tripod too much in the direction of the leg.-Ball head will not hold my Panasonic S5+100-400mm lens stable without drooping after setting position. This is when using a tripod collar on the lens.I think using the tripod at the beach and getting sand in the joints probably caused the issues I have but as mentioned I'm still pretty pleased. For someone not shooting around sand/dirt and not using a tripod very often this is a good purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this accessories kit for my GoPro HERO 3+ Silver Edition. It arrived on time and without a scratch. All of the various mounts are compatible with my GoPro HERO 3+ Silver Edition model. The accessories are of a very high quality and this kit is a very affordable option for GoPro users. I was skeptical because I had never heard of the brand \"EEEKit\" prior to my purchase of this accessories kit. However, I am very impressed with the product overall.The small gray bag is large enough to store a GoPro camera inside of the protective housing and is made of a \"felt-like\" material. I use the bag to store my GoPro when I am not using it to prevent scratching the protective housing. The Head Belt Strap Mount is large enough to be used with a helmet when expanded. I have used it while skiing, I put it on my helmet and it worked very well. The Chest Belt Mount works very well. It fits various body types due to the flexibility of the material it is made out of. The Extendable Handle Monopod is probably my favorite mount. It is expandable and is a good product for the price. I have not had the chance to use the Car Suction Cup Mount Holder, the Floating Handle Grip, 2 Piece Tripod Mount Adapter, 2 Piece Gopro Surface J-Hook. However, I intend to use them in the future as they seem to of a high quality.I would recommend this Accessories Kit to anyone that is looking to save some money and purchase a high quality Accessories Kit. Thank you for your time, and enjoy your GoPro.Be a HERO.",

Even the selfie stick works well - as long as you use the protective case. Taking the camera out of the case and sticking it on the selfie doesn't work, it just spins around. Maybe using a washer would help out because it just won't snug tight. Worth every penny I paid for it. I actually got lucky and the price went up by 31\u00a2 to get above $25 and free shipping. Highly recommend this kit - can't wait to go on holiday!",
