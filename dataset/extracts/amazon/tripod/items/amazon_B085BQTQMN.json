                "reviewText": "This is my second Peak Design Travel Tripod. The first one was apparently so nice that an unnamed TSA agent decided it would be better off in his possession than mine. That said, it was such a well designed tripod that I was willing to purchase a replacement immediately, which says a lot considering the price of this thing. It's not cheap, but its worth the cost to me.First, it's important to understand what this thing really is. It's not the most stable tripod in the work. There are much heavier sturdier tripods that are great for studio work, or if you don't mind lugging something four times heavier around with you. However, I have yet to find anything even close to as sturdy as this item is that is as easy to carry with you, or that is so well designed. This extends all the way down to the travel case for the tripod, which is a little padded fabric sleeve that keeps the tripod protected without adding an ounce more weight than necessary, and has handy attachment points for clipping to whatever other gear you have.Collapsed, the tripod is small and maybe more importantly well balanced. Its not overly top heavy or awkward to carry. It fits in water bottle pockets on backpacks (top will extend out, of course, good to have a strap too). Personally I usually clip it to the bottom of whatever pack I'm using using the reinforced loops on the travel pouch.In use the tripod is great. Its sturdy and very adjustable. Stability is greatly enhanced by hanging your backpack or other item from the hook on the center post, but even without that I had no issues and I use some pretty big lenses. Again, there are sturdier tripods, but this is meant for travel and easy carry, and considering how light it is I'm very impressed with the stability.The swivel mount is also well designed, but be aware it's different from a typical ball-mount tripod head. It has a lot of adjustability, and I really like using it once I got comfortable with it. But I'm not sure it's quite as adjustable as my Sirui. It's possible to mount a third party head on this tripod, but that requires the Universal Head Adapter from Peak Design, an additional purchase.Finally, there are a few additional nice touches with this tripod. It has a built-in mobile phone adapter. Yes, I'm guessing most people buying this tripod have \"real\" cameras to use with it, but it's a nice touch, and there are some uses for being able to easily mount your phone at times. It also has built in storage for the only tool you need for adjustments, a little allen wrench. The head is reversable, so you can actually mount your camera between the legs to get a really low shot.All in all, it's the best portable tripod I've found, and I've looked around a lot.",

                "reviewText": "So out of the box it's impressive. It's really a sight to behold, and when you have it in your hands you will feel the weight of it and wonder how it feels so well built while having the weight of cheap plastic. It's bold, it's strong, its stable. The cherry on top is how easy it is to use. Setting and resetting your position is so easy. It takes minimal movement. I can go from fully loose, to tightened down without ruining my shot. There's zero sag. When you set it, it stays. I also love how compact it is. Aside from it being as light as a croissant, it's so tiny that it makes storage a breeze. I've tried inside my bag and out. I settled on outside, and thanks to a durable case strap, I can feel confident in the way I mounted it. I couldn't be happier. This is well worth the money.",

                "reviewText": "So much neato stuff built into this travel tripod!I travel by motorcycle on camping/photography trips. Have another brand of travel tripod that I've used for several years. But when I saw this tripod and saw how small it is, I just had to pull the trigger and buy it for my next motorcycle camping photography trip. I just returned from the trip.I gotta tell you, this is the epitome of travel tripods. It really is only about 3-1/2\" diameter and maybe 15\" long. It packs in my saddlebag instead of having to be strapped to the motorcycle. And it's so easy to deploy! I can have it up with camera or spotting scope attached in just a minute. The lever-type binders for the legs make it so easy and quick. I deployed it several times where I might have hesitated or not deployed at all with my other tripod.The tripod is stable enough that I was able to train my 40X spotting scope on Saturn one evening, clearly seeing the rings and the space between the planet and rings. Of course, Saturn moved across the field of view with Earth rotation and without a little cross-hair spotting scope for the big one, it wasn't easy to keep Saturn centered. But that isn't because of the tripod. For wildlife viewing and photography, it was wonderfulWho'd have thought about putting an iPhone mount in the center stem? It's there! Didn't need to buy one!The little tool kit kept falling out until I learned that it has a detent if I turn it the right direction before stowing. Then, it's firmly attached.I may buy some of the accessories that Peak Design offers. Gotta sell my other carbon fiber travel tripod first.",

                "reviewText": "Mein altes Stativ ist ein wenig in die Jahre gekommen und ich habe mich auf die Suche nach einem neuen gemacht. Da ich viel reise sollte es nat\u00fcrlich leicht und kompakt sein, schnell auf- und auch wieder abgebauten und das ganze vielleicht auch mehrfach an einem Abend. Ich habe mir so ziemlich alle Stative angeschaut, die es f\u00fcr diesen Zweck gibt, irgendwas hat mir \u00fcberall nicht gefallen und auch beim Peak Design Travel Tripod finde ich nicht alles perfekt, meinen Anspr\u00fcchen wird es aber in den meisten Punkten gerecht.Die Klemmverschl\u00fcsse erm\u00f6glichen einen schnellen Auf- und Abbau, das Gewicht ist gro\u00dfartig, das Packma\u00df auch, ebenso wie die mitgelieferte Tasche, mit der man das Stativ in jeden Rucksack stecken kann, es bleibt gesch\u00fctzt, alles andere aber auch.Der Kugelkopf ist neu gedacht, dass man die Mittels\u00e4ule nun ein wenig (!) ausfahren muss, schadet der Stabilit\u00e4t nicht, beeinflusst aber das Packma\u00df \u00e4u\u00dferst positiv. Zugegeben f\u00fcr Freunde des gepflegten Panoramas wird es schwierig, L\u00f6sungen bzw. Kompromisse finden sich aber auch hier.Dass die Beine nicht rund sondern eher eckig sind, ist beim packen ein Vorteil, alles greift sch\u00f6n ineinander. Einen negativen Aspekt bei der Stabilit\u00e4t konnte ich bisher nicht entdecken.Spikes muss man ggf. separat erwerben - zugegebenerma\u00dfen h\u00e4tte man die bei dem Preis auch beilegen k\u00f6nnen. Trotzdem ist es gerade auf Reisen an der Sicherheitskontrolle ein Vorteil. Das Stativ kann im Fotorucksack ins Handgep\u00e4ck, die Spikes in den Koffer.F\u00fcr Fotografen, die viel unterwegs sind, ist das PD Stativ perfekt und ich habe mir die Entscheidung nicht leicht gemacht, der Preis ist abschreckend, mag sein, es gibt noch teurere Stative, aber am Ende ist ein Stativ, ein Stativ, ein Stativ... Daf\u00fcr bekommt man hier ein sehr durchdachtes Ger\u00e4t, dass all denen, die es leicht und praktisch m\u00f6gen viel Freude bereiten wird. Alle Einzelteile sind ersetzbar und eine lebenslange Garantie gibt es auch dazu. Was die dann bringt, wird man wohl erst im Garantiefalle sehen.Nach einigem Abw\u00e4gen habe ich mich trotz des Preises bewusst f\u00fcr das Ger\u00e4t entschieden, da es mir von allen m\u00f6glichen Kandidaten als am besten durchdacht erscheint und meinen Bed\u00fcrfnissen am n\u00e4chsten kommt.",
