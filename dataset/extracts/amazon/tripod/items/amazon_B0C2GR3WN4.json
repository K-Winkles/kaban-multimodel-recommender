It\u2019s a pain to take my iPhone cover off my iPhone before placing it on a tripod for videos and group picture taking. I was so ecstatic to find this adapter that actually fits a thick iPhone cover. It\u2019s also sturdy and well made. I am purchasing a second one for a friend who was admiring mine as a gift. Thanks!",

                "reviewText": "I used this on my s23 ultra (in a case) and there are no problems holding the phone. I am not sure how much it weighs, but you can tell its there on a selfie stick.---Revised---I am adding this to several items I have ordered because they work so well together and this might help you do something similar.While planning for a trip to the Denali National Park, I decided for a number of reasons, that I wanted to shot video and photos from the same monopod using two different devices at the same time. My normal monopod was too heavy to lug around with two things on it while fully extended, so I opted for a higher end selfie stick.I like to have 20 to 40 feet of cord when hiking in the event of an emergency, so I wrapped the handle of the selfie stick. This added some color and improved the grip.Next I ordered a reliable phone mount for the top of the selfie stick. That covered the cell phone on the selfie.Below that, I wanted a boom/cycle mount for an action camera. For this I ordered some action camera mounts, a cycle camera mount/aluminum boom.After assembly, it came out really nice and has been working very well. In case you want to build a similar setup, here are the parts:- https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C3BWV836- https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C18SP4T2- https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYHNQWSPI have had several strangers comment on the setup and ask me a bunch of questions.",

                "reviewText": "Great quality phone mount! Very sturdy all aluminum body. Seems like it will last a very long time.I can solve the mystery about the red \"locking konb\" for the landscape/portrait pivot point. The red you see is a cap that is super glued into place. I ripped mine off with pliers, but you could potentially get some acetone or other solvent in there and get it off without marring it. Underneath is a bolt that takes a 5mm allen wrench. It is an M6x16mm. There are two steel and two keyed plastic washers. The bolt is secured into the body of the mount with blue thread locker. So this is, in fact, adjustable. You will probably need to clean off, then add more thread locker if you want to adjust the pivot resistance. I just wanted to remove the arm.I used an existing dashboard bolt, and fabricated an aluminum bracket to bolt the phone mount to. The result is the most solid car phone mount I have ever seen.",
