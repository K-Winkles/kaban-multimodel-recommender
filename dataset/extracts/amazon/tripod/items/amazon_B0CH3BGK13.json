I don't always need to carry a backpack, so a nylon case that slings over my shoulder would have been ideal.But that is a small 'wish' that does not affect my thoughts on the selfie stick itself.The wireless remote allows you to take the photo in your own time, not reliant on a phone timer.The adjustability makes taking photos from any and all angles a breeze.This is my first selfie stick. The old-school in your hand models just never appealed to me. The tripod model is a great idea, and I wish I would have thought of it!",

                "reviewText": "This tripod does it's job 'okay' at best. I don't know that it's worth the price tag.The material feels very cheap in the hand, and it won't stand up to much abuse. It's very light weight, but the folding tripod base seems far too thick to be used for a selfie stick. Then the swivel mount on top is very loose, and the weight of my phone is enough to make it move on it's own, even in the \"locked\" position. The same mount also allows my phone to tilt to the side under its own weight, which can only be momentarily adjusted before it starts to sink back again.I do like how compact it can get, given the max height, but with so little weight on the base, even a small phone makes it so top heavy when fully extended that it becomes pretty unstable.I don't know that I'd recommend this; maybe if it were on sale or if they lowered the price. There are far high quality options in this price range.",

                "reviewText": "What I discovered: You don't want to force it open, especially if you haven\u2019t read the instructions. It seems like it is too tight or stuck at first but it is not. In reality this is put together to be compact which takes some design considerations and precision manufacturing. I like how compact and lightweight the stick is and found that it can fit in a men\u2019s pants pocket or coat inner pocket without sticking out too far. Nothing is sharp or unfinished and it fits together well.To get started, gently separate the 3 legs and you'll notice that while you are doing so there is a sliding ring portion above the legs that needs to slide down on the center telescoping pole. Once the tripod is open, it's just a matter of extending the telescoping pole, which by the way reminds me of the radio antenna on my first car (67 Renault, what a dud), and of a heavy duty version of the old G-I Joe toy walkie-talkies of the day. Occasionally wipe the antenna clean and you're good to go. The phone clamps into place intuitively and securely.The little remote control sort-of looks like it might be an opening/closing lock button so it is easy to miss the first time you use the stick. It is about 1\u201d x 2\u201d x 3/8\u201d with grey buttons and can be seen in a couple of the manufacturer\u2019s provided photos. The remote is only removable when the legs are in place AND the adjustable phone clamp is tilted up (note the thumb screw), or when the pole is extended. Bluetooth pairing with my phone was super easy using the instructions and pushing the switch made my phone take a photo.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:- Makes a great tripod - at full extension it will stand over 5 feet tall. It uses a telescoping extension mechanism which gives you a ton of flexibility on choosing heights to record from.- Has a removable Bluetooth shutter button for snapping pics at a distance.- Has a locking mechanism for angling your phone frontwards/backwards.- Folds up to be pretty compact. It fits well in my disc golf bag beside my telescoping disc grabber.- The legs make this incredibly sturdy on solid / relatively level ground.Cons:- The grip for holding your phone really only works to hold it horizontally (which is the best way to record, anyway). This wouldn't be a problem normally, but phone designers like to put buttons for the phone on the sides, and it's almost impossible to attach your phone to this so that it doesn't hit the volume rocker/power button. If you attach the grip on the end of your phone away from the buttons, the grip will tilt to the side, as there is no locking mechanism for side-to-side. I wish they had used a magnetic attachment point for MagSafe phones instead, but it is what it is.4 stars because the phone grip is annoying. The rest of the tripod is awesome, though.",
