Our coach has us doing some pretty cool drills and this allows us to hold the phone up and record her swings and the vr blast vision allows us to track her swings and get estimates on where the balls went with velocity and visuals. very cool stuff. The remote works great as well for traditional photo taking. the stand is sturdy and stood up to some nice winds. Its compact and travels well. a little pricey but looks and works great.",

Very packable, transportable. Easy to deploy. MINUSES (one star off): Only note these minor negatives: Like most selfie tripods, this is lightweight and may tip over (although this one has wider than average legs). Also, I would like to see a better designed remote that is easier to take in and out of slot on tripod legs, and somehow attached to minimize falling out and loosing. Other that those, highly recommend.",

The legs broke almost immediately and honestly, it was junk. But I liked the idea of the mechanism. So I jumped online, and after comparison shopping, I bought this. Honestly, I feel like I hit the jackpot. This is an incredibly sturdy, solid yet relatively lightweight tripod and selfie-stick. It's in a completely different league than my friend's tripod/selfie-stick, when now seems like a toy. I've only had good experiences using the Gahenwo tripod thus far.",
