                "reviewText": "This tripod is awesome! It\u2019s super tall (about 12\u201d taller than my old one) and the handles allow it to adjust your camera in any direction and tighten down once it\u2019s where you want it. It also has a leveling bubble so you can tell if the tripod is level or needs the feet adjusted. Came with a cellphone mount, which is what I primarily use, and a Bluetooth remote that pairs easily with my iPhone to take pictures easily. Travel bag is nice, but you have to take the camera mount off the tripod and remove the handles in order to get everything to fit in the bag. Not ideal, but it will definitely keep everything all together in one place for travel. The whole unit is very lightweight but solidly made.",

It's strong standing legs makes it more durable and does not lose balance.Phone attachment and remove are added advantage. I am wild photography freek and this works so well on unevenly surface. This is my 3rd stand and atlast I got real good one. I can stop looking for any more.Strongly recommended and real value for money \ud83d\udcb0",
