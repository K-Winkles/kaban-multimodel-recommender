                "reviewText": "Taking pictures is a hobby to me, so my needs out of a tripod were pretty simple. I originally bought this tripod for the purpose of setting up a \"photobooth\" at a Christmas party with friends with a Sony A5100, which was a very light camera so I didn't require much of the tripod other than just keeping it up. I am happy to report that it has been almost 5 years since and I still use this tripod! I use it to take our own family photos, recording family videos, to take pictures of the sky or any scenes where I need the camera to be superrrr still, etc.I have a heavier camera now (Sony A7II) in comparison to the one I had then, and even so I have not had any issues with stability. I will point out, however, that I don't use very heavy lenses (between 24mm and 55mm) so I cannot speak to how it would if you used longer, heavier telephoto lenses. I also have only used it mostly on flat land, so I also cannot speak to its stability in very uneven surfaces where you'd have to adjust the height of each leg differently.I find that it is extremely easy to set up and put away, and it is very light. You are able to adjust the height of the tripod as well as the angle of the camera very easily. I love the versatility of the mounting plate since I am able to screw in my DJI Osmo with my phone, as well as my insta360 and GoPro cameras.I have seen other tripods out there that are much more expensive so I'd imagine (or at least hope) that it would be much better quality, but not once have I found myself considering purchasing another yet. I think this tripod is quite a bang for your buck!",

It\u2019s very good with staying put especially with the little hook on the bottom for a weight or sand bag. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Great quality. Durable. Fantastic Value.Now I'm new to the DSLR game. Got the camera and then realized I would need so many more accompanying accessories. SD cards, bags, lenses, etc. Not a cheap hobby. When I went to search for Tripods, I was surprised by how expensive some of them were. It's basically metal and plastic, why's it so bloody expensive?! Upset, I went to see what the cheaper options were. Now this part is IMPORTANT. If you're a noob like me this is crucial. The cheaper tripods, basically the 50 inch ones at the tier lower than this, are utter garbage. Read the reviews. They're slightly cheaper but basically guaranteed to break after a few uses. Those tend to be built using mainly weak plastic. Even Amazon's 50inch seems to just be a rebranded Chinese version that everyone makes. They all have basically identical product listings and terrible reviews for the most part. You've got a fairly expensive camera, you don't want that to break to pieces just to save a few bucks.This is a worthy upgrade from those cheaper models. If you want an entry Tripod that's durable, well made, and has some cool features. This is the one for you. The color looks very sleek and feels like a much more expensive product. The protective bag is handy and doubles as a weight holder as well. Ideally, I wish I could get this build quality and price in a smaller 50 inch model (that way it can fit in my bag).I've enjoyed using this product and would recommend it to those looking for a great value tripod and don't want to spend a fortune to enjoy their hobby.Pros:-Weight - Light weight yet durable.-Quality - All components feel well put together. Doesn't feel like anything will easily break.-Price - Nearly the lowest option out there.-Value - For this price range, probably your best and safest option.-Features - Doesn't skimp out.Cons:-Could be smaller when fully compacted. I ideally wanted this to fit in my backpack so that I can easily carry it.-The rotation could be a little smoother. - A bit jerky for video and panoramas. Can't expect everything at this price. I probably just need to loosen something up.- Color. Meh, its ok. I wish it came in that gold option of Amazon's cheaper option. That looks a little nicer. Also, some of the color has faded from use and contracting and tightening over some parts (I've only used it a few times. What gives?).",

                "reviewText": "This tripod is cheaply made, and it shows. It's sturdiness is questionable, and often times a strong gust of wind can jostle it quite easily. The grips, and other components are made out of plastic and feel like it may not last in time, and it comes in a cheap-feeling canvas carrying bag that looks poorly designed.Now with all that said, you might think I despise or even loathe this tripod as it sounds like a bad product. But in truth, I actually like it a lot. ESPECIALLY for the price, and that's the key word.Price.I don't think there's a tripod on Amazon for the price of this one, that can be matched. While it has it's flaws in construction, for the price it makes sense. I wouldn't be expecting high grade construction, and stability with a price that's just under a 100. That'd be insane. And for the price it's darn good, no smooth-swivel head, but it does everything a tripod can do, AND it's lighter, can be adjusted to multiple lengths, surprisingly stable, and has an easy slip on mount that makes swapping between stuff extremely easy and fast.If you're not sure about getting into photography/videography of any kind, and don't want to spend too much on a functional/decent tripod. Then this is a good option, at the end of the day, if it doesn't work out, you don't have to worry about having spent too much.",

It's lightweight, sturdy and stable and works well for him to make YouTube videos (doesn't everyone?). There's nothing bad to say about it - it's extremely good value in my view. The only downside is that there is no adapter to take a camera underneath the tripod but you'd have to pay a lot more to find one that has this feature.",
