A lot of tripods I've bought in the past are rigid and I have to finagle with the settings to get just the right angle. Now with the flexibility of this tripod stand, it's shaved a few minutes off of my initial setup, allowing me to get to my video recording faster. I also appreciate that this came with a remote, which is handy whenever I need to quickly pause or don't like how a certain section of the video came out. Lastly, the adjustability of this stand allows me to record either standing, sitting, or hunched over a table. This tripod stand solved a lot of problems I wasn't even aware that I had. Great product and very happy I bought.",

It's one of the lightest and packs down smallest but has the highest reach, and the flexible top attachment is so great. I use it for filming but also to hold my phone while I watch shows on the couch, and in either case I can get it exactly where I want it to stay. It has been about a month of use now and I'm very pleased with my purchase.",
