I contacted the company for a replacement or refund and have not received a response in a week.

                "reviewText": "I had this same unit in red which my wife \"borrowed\" from me and so I ordered another one in white to replace it. The red one is several years old and still works like new. The positional legs allow you to easily aim your phone up, down, or stand it on non-level surfaces. Small enough to throw in a backpack and sturdy enough to use just about anywhere. Works with my big iPhone 11 just fine.",

You cannot tighten the phone vice enough to keep the phone from rotating no matter which way you position it. I\u2019ve had other tripods before and this one is pretty bad. I do not recommend.",
