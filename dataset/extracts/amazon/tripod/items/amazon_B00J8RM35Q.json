These are not sturdy and will not take a lot of abuse, but I\u2019m careful with tripods and equipment and expect it will last. Great price and well worth it.",

The \"aluminum\" is more like plastic, but it does the job without breaking given the fact you don't man handle it like a beast. It comes with a carrying case. The handle is made out of plastic but functions to move the camera whichever may you want to turn it. It's lightweight and folds up quickly enough with the strap on mechanism in place.It might break down the road or the handle might fall off, but it's okay for $10. Just buy another one I guess.",

The legs are very stable but lightweight so they will flex if you press. Adjusting to that lightness was easy. The results I got in my photos were terrific. I would buy this again if I needed to. Very happy to have this ... it extends well, is easy to carry with with and does what you'll want. Just figure out the adjustments (head angle) before you need it. If I could change one thing, I might spray paint the silvery metal legs a dull green to camo myself a little.",
