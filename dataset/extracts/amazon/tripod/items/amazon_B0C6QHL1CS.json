                "reviewText": "The Tarion TLS-01 is a compact stand with a 1/4\" male thread at the top. It's not a heavy duty stand but can work well for lightweight applications. For example, I added a phone mount to this stand, and it worked well as a mini desktop tripod. I found that by using this stand at a low height and on a desk or table worked best for me. Setting this stand high will require adding some weight at the bottom to prevent it from falling over.I think there are a few areas this stand could have been improved upon. For example, I think the 1/4\" mount could have had a rubber pad instead of being all plastic. The legs on this stand have plastic end caps, so there is no grip when placed on a smooth surface. When I first unboxed this stand, it already had some scratches on it. Also, I don\u2019t think this is a true light stand because it doesn't have a typical 5/8\" stud with a 1/4\" or 3/8\u201d thread.For mounting lightweight items or devices, I think this can be a practical stand, but due to the small base it\u2019s not the most stable when set high.",

                "reviewText": "This tripod is not at all flimsy and can mount up to 7 pounds! It is *sturdy!* Once extended, it is rock-solid on a flat surface, and I can mount anything from a smartphone to a long-lens DSLR camera with accessories on it. Fill lights, ring lights and even a remote video projector mount easily using the standard \u00bc-20 threaded mounting screw. I had thought that the plastic clamps would slip under load, or possibly crack, but everything is robustly made, and I can use the tripod as a workhorse for whatever I need at the moment. It is even sufficiently steady that I can attach a camera gimbal and operate it through remote control. Depending upon the load, yes, a moderate wind can cause a little bit of sway, but there is less movement using this tripod than I have with my expensive, carbon-fiber unit. Three cheers for the inexpensive, built-like-a-tank tripod!",
