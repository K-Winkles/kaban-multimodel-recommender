It can support a Sony ZV-E10 and I have full confidence that it can handle the weight, the tripod is sturdy/stable, and when folded into a handle for extension/selfie stick mode the tripod legs become a nice and grippy handle. I really love this thing!",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice, small tripod with a perfect, small extension for carrying a DJI pocket camera. It's ideal if you're filming In crowds, or as you're walking among people who might not want their faces visible in your vlog.As a tripod, the legs might not be as sturdy as you'd like, but for us, they're fine. The extension is a little stiff at first, but becomes easier to use after a few times of extending it fully, then collapsing it, and so on.For the under $25 price, this is a very good value, easy to tuck into a pocket or small bag, and a generally sturdy design if you just need a small tripod or extension.",

The Akaso, similar to a GoPro, fits on it perfectly and I'm never worried about it coming off. The clip it comes with to secure your phone is not perfect, my often pops out, but for taking photos or just leaving it in one place while you record something, it does a pretty good job. And the tripod is definitely durable. It doesn't extend terrible high. But for the price, I don't know if there is a tripod that is much better than this one. Highly recommended.",

I attempted making the camera vertical and it didn\u2019t stand that way either. I also attach a light to my camera which doesn\u2019t help. It\u2019s good for walking and vlogging but it\u2019s not sturdy enough for what I want to do. I\u2019m going to keep it because of the phone attachment and the height adjustment though.",
