I have not yet tried the cell phone holder other than just to see if my cell phone fit (I-phone 13 pro in a case) and it did. The carrying case is great to protect it while not in use. I definitely would recommend this tripod.",

                "reviewText": "My son and I were making a music video for our family's stamp free holiday card, and we needed a tripod to shoot the actual video portion. Given that we recorded the audio using a microphone we bought from Goodwill for $3, we weren't exactly working with a Hollywood budget. This tripod met our needs perfectly, showed up overnight, and only had one unidentified washer floating around in the packaging. It was easy to set up, our video came out great. Long term, I'm not convinced this is going to be super durable, but it's getting the job done so far, and if it breaks, like I said, it was cheap enough. Recommended, with the caveat that we've used it exactly once.",

I haven't used this one out yet but the build quality and weight seems good for carrying around, the height seems good seeing how I'm only 5'3\". My only gripe is the area where the camera sits seems a bit stiff, maybe with more use it will turn more freely or maybe some wd-40. All in all I'm happy and would buy again.",

If you turn the mount left, it will loosen the screw rather than pivot like other tripods. When the screw is loosened, your camera/device becomes vey flimsy and is noticeable both visually and on recording.",
