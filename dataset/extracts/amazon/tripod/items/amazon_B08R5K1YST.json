I can carry this on my motorcycle and have a height adjustable tripod wherever I am. It slips easily into my backpack when traveling on a plane. I mean, it is PERFECT. When used in the shortest position it is very stable. However, the farther you extend the single post the less stable it becomes. It is not really usable with a DSLR or anything heavier than a smartphone or action camera. This is one of my all-time favorite pieces of camera gear. The one thing they could add to improve this would be a 1/4 20 tripod mount (female) to the side of the base (where the Insta360 logo is). This would allow it to be used as an extendable horizontal arm when attached to another tripod. Nevertheless, it is amazing and I plan to order a second one to leave in my motorcycle trunk at all times so I always have it with me. This one will remain in my studio.",

However, what is missing is the wrist strap attachment as with the other sticks with third parties. If this stick had the wrist strap attachment, this would have been the perfect stick. I can only give this review 4 stars. For the price I paid, I would think it would include a wrist strap feature. I need this for when I snowboard. Also, I have confirmed with the snow resort, no sticks unless it has a wrist strap so I will have to return this.",

It can be extended easily and retract easily (one non original brand stick I bought, it cut my finger once while trying to retract it.... causing my finger bleed miserable... as it literally chop off a portion of my finger while forcibly retract it... yes, it saved my a few bucks compared to the manufacturer made; but trust me, after that bleeding finger instance, I trashed it and bought the original manufacturer one). And this new version of 360 selfie stick won't have this issue, easy to extend and retract easily and Safely.... Moreover, it's now have a built in tripod which is quite sturdy, which can be used as a standard tripod for other phone cameras. The quality is very good. I'd been using it for a couple months now and have no issue whatsoever. While its more expensive than other no brand ones, I will recommend this Original Manufacturer one.",
