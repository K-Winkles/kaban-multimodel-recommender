I was thrilled to see that it was inside, along with the remote.The tripod is adjustable in every way someone should want. It opens out to over 33\" (85cm) tall then mounting pad extends up to make it about 40.5\" (105cm). Closing the legs in to use this as a monopod brings the height of the camera pad to 42.5\" (108cm). The only way I can see this being as long as advertised it by rotating the handle to point up, but this would point the camera at the ground.Anyway, I do not need a tall tripod. This one is tall and sturdy enough for me.The cross supports are plastic but they do their job. I imagine this keeps the weight low too.",

I bought many and returned them because they were bad quality and were so expensive. Now, what I really like about this product is its value. It's so cheap and the quality is amazing. It works really well and I can my videos so much more easily. Very portable because is so light. I strongly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "This thing is as advertised with a lot of add-ons and so on. The wireless remote works perfectly when connected to my Samsung Galaxy and Motorola Stylus G. I have no iPhone and so can't say how well it works on that platform. The remote has only one button, unlike others that have one for Apple and one for Android, making it easier to use. The biggest problem with this thing is that it is FLIMSY! OMG! I have no doubt that it will be able to support my devices, but I have no idea how long this thing will last, after being taken around and no doubt falling over a few times. This is not a quality piece at all. I kinda regret buying it, but I don't envision using it a lot and will probably get what I pay for in the end. I can't recommend it, to be honest, because it is just a really bad design.",

It held my tiny SE perfectly as well as a friend's 14 equally well. I did not try the remote, so I cannot speak for how well it works. But I think it's great value for the money. I did return it, but only because I needed and overhead mount and failed to realize this was the wrong tool for that. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase again, however if I was looking for a traditional tripod for my phone.",
