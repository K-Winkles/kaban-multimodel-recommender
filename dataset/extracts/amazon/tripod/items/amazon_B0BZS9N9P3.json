Sometimes I have to take the phone out of the case to get it to fit into cheap spring adjusting holders.This holder is very sturdy, my phone fits, and it's attractive.I Vlog a lot and use my phone for measuring landscapes with various digital devices. This mount leveled me up and I sincerely appreciate everything about it.I know it sounds silly to gush about a product, but this one really solved some serious problems for me.",
