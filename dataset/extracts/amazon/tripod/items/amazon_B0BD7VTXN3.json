                "reviewText": "This is for me the perfect tool. I absolutely love it.I am not a selfie-stick guy but I have wanted a good portable tripod for a long time. This offers so much flexibility it's really impressive. The length is short enough that I can fit it into my travel sling but long enough that it is able to stand up securely. The legs flip out with a pull-apart action at the bottom of it. The top pulls up off the end and has forward and back tilting options which work great both in the selfie-stick and tripod configuration.The remote is quick and responsive and bluetooth-pairing it was quick and easy. I have used it many times and have yet to recharge it.if you're someone who has large family gatherings where everyone says let's take a picture together at the end and it takes you an hour to get everyone situated, YOU NEED THIS THING!! It gave everyone a focal point, made it easy to take the pics and adjust without folks getting up and down.I actually made this a little easier because I have a pixel watch that has an app on it to view what my phone is seeing. I am therefore able to zoom in/out and adjust it after sitting down to make sure I can see everyone and then take the picture either from the remote or my watch. I used both because I don't want to look at my watch in the picture and can quickly snap a bunch of pics by pressing the trigger instead. If you don't need time to go sit down you really don't need a delay timer so it makes everything that much faster.Going outdoors as long as your ground is fairly flat I think it should be fine. I have not tried it in rocky terrain yet but will next month and update this if it changes. So far this is the best of these i have tried and far cheaper than some of its competitors which frankly don't do all the things this one does.",

Tripod is sturdy enough, but I wouldn't trust being on pavement on a windy day.Very compact, portable and easy to set up. Best of all, we don't have to take turns taking group photos!I will report with android phones, if you have the volume button set for zoom or volume control, the remote will not work correctly. Simply go into your settings, then shooting methods and make sure the volume buttons are set to take a picture.To be honest, I didn't know that I needed a tripod/selfie stick until I bought this one. Now, we take it on every excursion.Overall, I'm very happy.",

The tripod is lightweight, good quality and easy to travel with, it folds with in itself so it makes storage and travel easy and you don\u2019t have to mess around with the leg clips like other tripods have. It is tall in height, I am almost 5\u20198\u201d and it comes up to my face. It has a bluetooth remote so it makes filming and taking photos so easy, especially if you\u2019re by yourself and the remote already comes installed with a watch battery so you\u2019ll need to replace it when the time comes.

                "reviewText": "I read the reviews here before purchasing this tripod and they were mostly positive. Since we're all using phone cameras these days, I wanted a tripod that is specifically made for holding phones as versus cameras. We used it to get group pictures on both Christmas and later on a holiday visit with additional family. It was so easy to set up with a sturdy tripod and firmly held iPhone. Love, love the remote - what a treat not to set a timer and have someone run to their position for the shot. I'm planning on taking this on my next vacation. It's light, but sturdy, and will be easy to pack and carry. Great product!",

Lo \u00fanico no me agrad\u00f3 es que no gira 360\u00b0 d\u00f3nde va empotrado el tel\u00e9fono, al igual que la pinza d\u00f3nde se sujeta siento le falta presi\u00f3n para sujetar, pero acomodando bien el celular no se mueve ni corre riesgo de ca\u00edda, ya lo puse a prueba, siento que si mejorar\u00e1n este punto ser\u00eda el tripi\u00e9 perfecto. El mini control trae para tomar fotos a distancia enlaza r\u00e1pido a bluetooth, lo malo es que este usa pila de boton, igual ser\u00eda perfecto si fuese de carga USB.
