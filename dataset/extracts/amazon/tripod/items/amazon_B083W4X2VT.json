                "reviewText": "I bought this to use with my Sony rx100 for a 2 week trip to Europe. At first I couldn\u2019t get it to connect to my camera until I realized after days of trying that you need to select \u201cRmt Control\u201d in addition to just the Bluetooth connection. Once I did that it worked perfectly with zero connection issues from then forward.It is very comfortable and fit my hand well. Controls were all easy to use. For a smaller camera it was so much easier to hold onto with the grip than holding the camera itself. The grip made it much more secure of a grip so I was able to take different angles, hold it out windows, and other positions I couldn\u2019t do with just the camera. Also the grip made holding the camera while carrying it more secure and less likely to drop it.The tripod was great for pictures, especially low ones where I just set it on the ground. Also good for just setting the camera on a table or wherever without laying the camera down. My only wish is that there was a tether point for a strap or something to secure it to my hand. I generally had a strap around my neck for security but some shots required me to take it off. I could use a tether point on the camera but the it conflicts with the jacket.I am addicted and almost hate to shoot without it. Highly recommend it, particularly for smaller or medium cameras.",

I tossed them all in the washer and pushed go. Guess what went thru the full wash cycle? He opened it up and little or no water was inside. Spent the night in a warm (80F) oven to dry it out. Attached it the next day and it works just like it should. I don\u2019t suggest washing it to test how water proof it is but don\u2019t be afraid of a little rain! I was so impressed that I dug up the old order just so I could write a review.",
