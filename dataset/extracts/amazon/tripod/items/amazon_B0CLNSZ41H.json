                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I needed a tripod as my hand isn't steady enough on long exposures and the K&F Concept Selfie Stick Tripod, 360 Degree Rotation Mini Phone Stand with Ball Head and Cold Shoe Mount, Cellphone Holder with Wireless Remote for Smartphone (Black) seemed worth a try. I find it is a good, easily carried tripod to bring along on a hike. The included Bluetooth remote shutter button helps make for clean, sharp photos with my older Galaxy A class smartphone very consistent and I am no longer deleting half of my photos right off the bat because they were blurry. I don't do selfies but the stick and shutter button really helps getting shots of the underside of the car, inside the mower deck on the tractor, the trailer suspension, behind the furnace, washer/dryer or just about any place you need to see but is hard to get to. However the most unsual use I have found is getting a face to face video of our local grouse (see video). Grouse are quite territorial so while it looks like it's friendly, curious and almost tame, it's really just looking for an opportunity to peck at my heels. We find it's quite adorable but my neighbor finds it just annoying \ud83d\ude04.The spring-loaded phone holder is big enough to hold my phone with the aftermarket case I put on it which was not the result I have had with most holders I have tried in the past. The extending wand is a little stiff and takes a reasonable pull to get open intially.Definitely Recommended!\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

                "reviewText": "I have a bunch of selfie sticks, tripods, ball heads and so evaluating it in light of that. This is the smallest tripod that I have and I knew that this was going to be small when I purchased it. It was still a bit of shock to see how tiny it is. You cannot take use this as a selfie stick unless you are planning to use your face to a majority of the shot. The phone holder on this is not high quality but then that's not what I got it for. I just wanted a very small tripod for use on my table to hold random gear such as small LED lights/microphones etc and for that it works well. The included remote is an afterthought. There is no place to stow it on the tripod and it is the generic remote you can find on any selfie tripod.The key value for me is the tabletop nature and stow ability. Overall, a decent product. Don't go into it thinking you are getting a real selfie stick, rather a supporting tripod for your tabletop studio and it will work fine.Ok value for money but if you truly want a selfie stick, carry on your search cause this ain't it",

                "reviewText": "First off, the size is a winner. When collapsed, it's small enough to literally fit into my pocket, making it incredibly convenient for when I travel or keeping in my gym bag for those post workout pump photos. The lightweight design doesn't sacrifice stability, though \u2013 once extended, it stands solid, providing a steady base for my smartphone.Setting it up is a breeze. The adjustable legs and flexible ball head make positioning my phone a snap. Whether I'm shooting a time-lapse, capturing a group photo, or filming a video, the Compact Marvel ensures my phone stays securely in place.Durability is another standout feature. The build quality is impressive for such a compact device. The sturdy materials give me confidence that it can handle the occasional bumps and knocks that come with travel and outdoor shooting.Versatility is where this tripod truly shines. The adjustable ball head allows for easy adjustment in a range of tilt angles, giving me the freedom to frame my shots exactly how I want. The phone mount is set ideally for landscape orientation, however you can set it for portait, though that limits the angles you use the ball head with.Included in the box is a bluetooth remote that can start and stop video recording and act as a remote shutter for taking photos at a distance, think posed photos or group photos.Overall, the Compact Marvel phone tripod is a must-have accessory for anyone serious about smartphone photography. Its portability, stability, durability, and versatility make it a standout in the crowded tripod market. Whether you're a vlogger, photographer, or just someone who wants better stability for their smartphone shots, this tripod is a worthy investment that will undoubtedly elevate your mobile photography game.",

                "reviewText": "This is a good value small tripod. It has a holder for phone with two 1/4\" threads on the phone holder, and a cold shoe.It took me a little extra effort get it to extend the first time, but after that I feel like it's going to extend well and hold weight without sliding down.The adjustment knob feels nice, and across from it is another 1/4\" attachment point for something like a light or microphone.The shutter button is a Bluetooth button, those are cheap and easy to find, but it's nice that they included it. The color of the shutter matches the rest of the tripod nicely, but again, If you have a nicer one, just stick with that.This is a great value tripod, and I recommend it!",
