                "reviewText": "I am giving it 5 stars because it is solidly built selfie stick that is very useful and versatile. It feels secure to put on an action camera, phone or digital camera on it. For the phone you will need to buy a phone holder as well. It has a tripod that opens wide and I have no concern that it will hold a small camera stable for any kind of selfie/group shots or vlogging by yourself.My only issue with this was that it is quite big, more than 12 inches long, and it won't fit in any kind of pants or jacket pocket. You will need to either carry it in your hand or put it in a backpack/suitcase. Just keep that size in mind and if that's okay for you then this is a really good selfie-stick/tripod which can be a very useful around the house or on travel.",
