                "reviewText": "Easy to put together and adjust height-wise. Gooseneck adjusts smoothly and the base is stable enough to keep unit upright even with phone adjusted well over the side. Quick to fold up and put away. The section that holds the phone fits my large phone with a case and a large ring/stand on the back. I had to install an app to use the remote, and that is the reason for four stars instead of five. The app contains ads so you have to wait to get to the screen to take pictures. If you have a compatible phone you can just use your phone's camera app with the remote and I would highly recommend that instead. I like the adjustability of this and it is very convenient and far more comfortable to have your phone positioned on this instead of having to hold it.",

The legs are strong and stable. They cellphone holder is adjustable to fit most phones and the remote is a great addition. Good tripods are hard to find and this one is functional and comes in at a good price. I am pleased.",

I had a tiny bit of trouble getting my iPhone 12 Pro Max to not make the tripod fall over, as it also has a pretty heavy duty case on it, but I just had to tighten the phone holder to it's limit. Overall, I love this tripod, and I'll definitely be using it for my future vlogging/IRL streaming ventures!",
