It has some weight, but not too heavy for those long hiking trips. At full extension, this tripod is massive, great for the high angle shots and has the option to take a leg off and turn it into a monopod. Such an awesome design, and very sturdy for the low price tag.I wanted to test this tripod out with my heaviest lens to see if it was sturdy enough to hold up my 600mm when out in the field and it\u2019s definitely held up to the test. I attached photos with it set up for reference.I have used this in different terrain in the field and I have to say that it\u2019s well made and really holds up to the test. Sand, rocks, water, it really did a great job of holding up against the wind and water flow. This tripod is a great deal for the price and I can\u2019t wait to travel with it more. It has quickly become my go to tripod.",

                "reviewText": "I was a little skeptical considering the price point of this tripod but i chose to give it a test drive. I own a few tripods, travel tripod, heavy duty tripod for astrophotogrpahy and some general use ones, all from various prominent brands. This Tripod was a pleasant surprise, It's made of aluminum and very easily folds into a moderately small package (however, its large than a travel tripod). It also looks amazing in the glad and gold trim. It is sturdy and was able to hold my Pro DSLR with a 70-200mm lens mounted on it. My only quibble are the twistlocks, but that is a personal preference thing, mostly because when shooting in the cold outdoors for extended periods of time, a lever is easier to operate than twistlocks. This thing is tall!!!! but is can also be used for low shots to the ground by flipping the center column, oh and the center column also has a hook for weights. one of the legs is detachable and it becomes a monopod when used with the center column. The tripod came with tools to tighten the allen nuts and also a nice carry bag and a spare screw mount as seen in the photos, great tripod of the price. Also as you can see in the photos, it works in extreme temperatures",

                "reviewText": "This is a high quality, lightweight alloy tripod. Its excellent quality and straight comes from its precise CNC technology.It features a 360\u00b0panoramic scale that it is great for panoramic shoots. Its level calibrator helps get the tripod to get a straight set up. Setting it up is a breeze with its quick-release flip locks. It extends to a maximum of 77\u201d or as low as 23 1/2 inches. The center column can be flipped upside down to capture low angle perspectives.Let\u2019s not forget the quick release plate with standard 1/4 inch mounting screw compatible with almost all DSLR , video cameras, GoPro, etc out there. Going from a full tripod to a monopod is just a few seconds for times when a monopod is needed.Another feature to mention is its center column hook that can hang objects increasing stability. The non-slip rubber feet design stabilize the tripod to different ground conditions.It is light weight but rigid and strong, very portable and easy to carry with its included carrying case-shoulder bag anywhere photography takes place. A ball head cover is even included.This is a must professional tripod for serious professionals.",

                "reviewText": "(Full Disclaimer): This tripod was provided to me to review for other photographers.I have been working as a portrait photographer for the past few years, and as a portrait photographer, I don\u2019t use a tripod too extensively (compared to someone who does real estate photography, product photography, landscape photography, etc).What I liked about this tripod is it\u2019s beautiful looks and height adjustment option. The black and gold finish looks really good in studio. It is a low profile yet bold statement for style. Also, this tripod is really tall. I think all photographers often wish for a taller tripod on occasion, and this tripod provides that extra height. That\u2019s really valuable, and also makes it really versatile because you can basically adjust it to whatever height you need.What I didn\u2019t like about this tripod is that I cannot seem to tighten each joint securely, especially when I mount a heavier DSLR (the plate that goes onto the camera seems to be the toughest one to tighten for me). All those sections are intended to be adjustable, but I would love to see improvement on this part in future products so the tripod can be lock tight when it needs to be and can loosen up easily when I need to re-adjust.Overall, this tripod is perfect for beginners who are just getting into photography. Its low price and versatility in height adjustment (from very low to high) makes it a great option for most photo needs. And it just looks awesome!",

                "reviewText": "I love this tripod! I recently purchased it to take on a trip to Austin Texas. I have a vanguard and it\u2019s very nice but a little heavier than I want when hiking. This tripod is perfect. It has the height needed, 77 inches and collapsed is less than 23\u201d. It has a 360 ball head to allow fine adjustments. I was really curious to see how it would hold my Nikon Coolpix P1000. That camera is a beast and it performed like a champ. I was so impressed. There was no drift when I had it in portrait mode or when I extended the zoom. It held the weight beautifully. I primarily shoot with a sony mirrorless and it did great with that too. I had it in the water, used the center hook to weight it down and had no motion from the waves. It even performed well in the wind. I stored it in the side pocket of my backpack while hiking which made taking it along so easy. This tripod really is great. It\u2019s my go to tripod now. It even works with my peak design quick release system. I\u2019m so happy with this purchase and the price point is exceptional considering the features and functionality of this tripod. The locking mechanism of the feet are nice too. I have no complaints and highly recommend this tripod.",

                "reviewText": "Este tripi\u00e9 mide m\u00e1s de dos metros de altura (203 cm) totalmente extendido. Plegado mide un poco m\u00e1s de 50 cm. Viene con un estuche con correa ajustable para transportarlo colgado del hombro, una bolsita de tela con jareta para proteger la cabeza, una llave allen y un tornillo y una tuerca extras para juntar una pata con la columna central y armar el monopi\u00e9. La caja lleg\u00f3 algo maltratada, pero con el producto en buen estado, en una bolsa de pl\u00e1stico, adentro del estuche y oliendo a nuevo. El aluminio parece de buena calidad, aunque las partes de pl\u00e1stico me parecieron algo fr\u00e1giles, pero el conjunto parece bien construido, es estable y se ve bonito. Buena estabilidad; lo prob\u00e9 con una Nikon D3500 con un lente Sigma 18-50 f2.8. Ojo: si vas a usar el tripi\u00e9 donde no haya piso firme, en tierra, lodo o suelo pedregoso debes saber que las patas no tienen en la punta rosca para tornillos ni picos met\u00e1licos, s\u00f3lo unos regatones de pl\u00e1stico unidos con pegamento al tubo; apuesto que los regatones pronto se desgastar\u00e1n con el uso y tendr\u00e9 que comprar otros nuevos. La perilla grande de la cabeza, que sirve para trabar la bola, estaba muy dura y cre\u00ed que no funcionaba; tuve que ponerme un guante de carnaza para darle vuelta y aflojarla, y ya funcion\u00f3 bien. Por esos detalles no le pongo 5 estrellas, pero creo que s\u00ed se merece 4.5, aunque Amazon no permite medios puntos en las evaluaciones. Pero, por el precio ($ 2581.46 MX), el tama\u00f1o, la calidad aparente y las funciones que tiene este producto no me puedo quejar mucho y, como fot\u00f3grafo aficionado, s\u00ed recomiendo su compra.Despu\u00e9s de unos meses de uso actualizar\u00e9 esta rese\u00f1a.",
