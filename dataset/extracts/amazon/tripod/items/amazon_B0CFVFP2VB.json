                "reviewText": "This tripod is built pretty solid. From the weight and feel of the overall assembly, to the adjustable legs and pivoting feet. Everything feels like a quality build with the only item I found that could have had a small upgrade was the camera head assembly itself. The head is a pivoting and adjustable quick release but feels like it doesn\u2019t match with the rest of the tripod in relationship to high quality feel. That said I\u2019m very happy with the tripod and all the extras packed into this setup.I\u2019m not a professional photographer but do enjoy the hobby and just learning about different photoshoot methods. I have a tripod that I purchased years ago when camcorders were still a thing and it\u2019s aged well so I welcome this new item to my camera gear.The tripod is huge with regards to the adjustable height. I\u2019m 6\u20194\u201d and this tripod can set my camera at eye level all well keeping my expensive DSLR camera stable. The screw in feet that come with the tripod are adjustable with varying angles that flatten out the base. You get (4) adjustable extensions on each side giving you some pretty precise adjustability for where you need to setup. The upper sections have padding that when collapsed and folded up, keeps this great stand feeling good in your hands or protected in the case bag that comes with it. The bottom of the tripod has a convenience hook that can be used to hold a sandbag for stability or even use the tripod bag filled with rocks and hooked over this hook, keeping everything in its place.The Pan, Tilt Head has fluid controls that keep your camera smooth when making video transitions or just plain angle adjustments. Everything comes first time needing some assembly but it\u2019s quick work and you\u2019ll be up and snapping photos quickly.The extras are nice with this tripod. From the bag already mentioned to some cellphone accessories making your camera phone sessions much easier and professional looking. They included a tensioned camera tripod mount that lets you grab your phone in portrait or landscape mode and will even accept some larger tablets. The threaded insert connects easier to your tripod and then you get a key fob camera snap that works with both iOS on iPhone and Android models. I was able to connect effortlessly to my iPhone by simply turning on the fob by sliding the switch on the side and finding the AB Shutter3 in my available Bluetooth device connections. Once connected I just opened my camera app and began snapping photos. It also works for taking live photos (at least on iPhone tested) just by holding the snap button in to activate live footage.I\u2019ve used this tripod several times so far for photo shoots and also took it to the field and set up an Amateur radio Yagi Antenna that I made from scratch and added a threaded insert for mounting to a tripod. The angles and adjustability of this tripod allowed me to position my Yagi antenna in the highest direction of gain. I\u2019m very happy with my new tripod and hope this lasts me as many years as my first one bought in the nineties.",

                "reviewText": "I recently had the pleasure of upgrading my camera gear with a new tripod, and the difference it has made in my photography journey is nothing short of remarkable. One of the first things that struck me about this tripod was its exceptional build quality. As an amateur photographer who had previously used a more affordable model, I can genuinely say that this upgrade has been a game-changer. The difference in stability and sturdiness is immediately noticeable. It's a significant leap from my old, flimsy tripod, which often left me frustrated with shaky shots.The sturdiness and durability of this tripod are particularly impressive. It provides the perfect support for my Canon T7i, ensuring that my shots are sharp and blur-free. Its robust construction gives me the confidence to take long exposure shots or shoot in challenging conditions without the worry of camera shake. I've even used it in windy outdoor settings, and it remains rock solid.But, what truly sets this tripod apart is its user-friendly features. The inclusion of a cell phone mount and a Bluetooth shutter release has made my photography experience even more enjoyable. I can easily set up my smartphone for time-lapses, group shots, or as a remote monitor for my Canon T7i. The Bluetooth shutter release is also very nice, allowing me to take photos and start videos without having to touch my camera, which is perfect for capturing wildlife or those magical sunsets. Setting up the tripod is a breeze. The quick-release plate makes it easy to attach and detach the camera swiftly. The adjustable height and angle make it versatile for different shooting situations. It's lightweight and easy to carry around, and the carrying bag that comes with it is an added bonus.This premium camera tripod has completely transformed my photography experience. Its quality, sturdiness, and user-friendly features have taken my Canon T7i's capabilities to a new level. It's a substantial upgrade from the cheaper tripod I used to own, and I couldn't be happier with the results I've achieved using it. Whether you're a beginner or a more experienced photographer, this tripod is a must-have tool for capturing those perfect shots.",

                "reviewText": "The quality of this tripod isn\u2019t great but it\u2019s at least as good as you could reasonably expect for the cost. The clamps when you extend the legs are strong but everything is plastic so it does get a bit wobbly with the weight of a camera. This would be good for a beginner or someone with a tight budget.",

                "reviewText": "I have a multi-camera podcast studio and have tried a number of tripods.This tripod is almost double the price and probably twice as much better as some basic $20 tripods I have. It is worth the cost. This tripod has everything a basic tripod has but it's easier to adjust and sturdier. It is easier to adjust the camera. I use all still shots so I don't pan while filming. I've found this to feel really nice and secure. It's been bumped as people walk by and it hasn't tipped yet. It feels sturdy both in construction and on the floor. There are a lot of nice extra touches that usually more expensive tripods have. There is an easy to grab handle for carrying. There is a tiny spirit level to know when the tripod is level. There is a small hook underneath for holding my stuff (in my case, power and HDMI coils). I'm very happy with this and find it to be very good value for what you get.",
