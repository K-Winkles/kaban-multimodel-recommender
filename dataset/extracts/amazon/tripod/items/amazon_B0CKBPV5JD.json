Overall, I really recommend this gimbal for any mobile video creators!!!!",

                "reviewText": "So I'm not really a content creator or vlogger, but I've seen them out in the wild filming video with their smartphones using gimbals and I always wondered what the benefit would be, and I get it now after using this gimbal to film a little video here and there with my Google Pixel 6 - the added stability that using the gimbal provides when filming video just makes for a better less shaky, more professional looking video.It took me a little bit to figure out the setup, along with the included software, to use it well, but once I was able to complete that somewhat major hurdle, it was fairly easy to use, and the video I filmed just looks way better than when I was just holding the phone in my hands. It's definitely not a simple plug-and-play type of situation, and the instructions were a little unclear at first, but I think most people should be able to figure it out eventually. This is probably a starter/beginner level hardware with an intermediate level of knowledge required to use the app and it's functions.As hardware, this feels sturdy and pretty well made. It definitely doesn't feel like a cheap selfie stick or something like that, it has a semi-professional grade of quality. Lastly, trying to use this as a smartphone stand/tripod isn't great - it works fine but because the legs are so short, it's definitely a little precarious for more than short uses. But it works in a pinch and I imagine if I was travelling it could work vs carrying an extra stand. The included fill-light I think is for filming these type of close-up selfie/vlogging videos, which is a nice little addition, but limited use.",

                "reviewText": "I am not a content creator, but I am a mom with kids in sports and now I can embarrass the heck out of them by being on the sidelines with my gimbal! Woohoo!In all seriousness, this is actually super useful at sporting events. I'm really impressed with the stabilization, as well as the ability to follow a face without creating a dizzying effect. I am definitely going to take it with me on vacation to record more memories.There is a learning curve here, especially if\u2014like me\u2014you're new to gimbals. There is an instruction booklet included but I still had to go online and watch videos to figure out what I was doing.One thing to be aware of: this is clearly NOT designed to work with any sort of remotely bulky iPhone case. (SHARPIE FOR SCALE so you can see how high up the grips go\u2014I couldn't take a picture of my phone in it because...well...I needed my phone to take the picture. Lol.)I have a case on my iPhone 15 that I never thought of as excessively thick (though you can store 2-3 cards in it) and there is no way it would safely fit in the phone grip of this gimbal. I hate using my phone without a case because I'm worried about damage, so I wish I would have considered that before making this purchase.Still, I think this is an excellent starter gimbal and I am willing to use my phone caseless if it means getting to annoy my children. Ahh, memories.",

                "reviewTitle": "Fairly decent 3-axis gimbal, case dependent, auto-tracking, gesture control, focus/zoom, app req'ed",
                "reviewText": "This is a fairly decent 3-axis gimbal that's reasonably well-constructed although it's mostly made of plastic typical of gimbals at this price point. It comes with a detachable tripod which I do appreciate and a magnetically attached RGB light that I don't really see the use case simply because it's not nearly and adequately bright for it to be useful unless the object is REALLY close to it; nonetheless, it's there should you have the need for it.The overall physical build quality is decent albeit typical of most others with similar design and style at this price range although it doesn't necessarily feel cheap but it's nothing to write home about either. It's made of mostly hard plastic and the look and feel in general is above average; the buttons and knob work reasonably well and smoothly without issues.Unfortunately, the phone clamp is its weakest point because it's NOT designed in such way that it could accommodate thicker cases or even phones additional 'accessories' at the back such as an expanding phone mount (aka PopSocket) or other types of phone holders/grips, foldable or not. This has drastically and negatively impacted the true usefulness of this gimbal because nobody (well, maybe somebody somewhere but I'm certainly not one of 'em) would care to remove the phone case repeatedly just to use this gimbal.I should also mention that the ONE reason why it wouldn't work, at least with the case of PopSockets is that the clamp MUST grip onto the phone in the middle in order for it to work properly and the reason for that is simply the motor isn't powerful enough to move the phone if the phone is attached to the clamp at one of the ends (i.e. not balanced). With that being said, this is not unique to this particular gimbal because most of these budget gimbals simply aren't equipped to hold a phone unless it's situated right in the center.It has a simple and yet typical design of controlling the various features and functions of the gimbal and no detail discussion is necessary since they are for the most part self-explanatory; however, I'll very briefly describe them but know that most features such as auto tracking, gesture control are only available with the help of the app (Aochuan) because it doesn't have a dedicated camera/sensor, and I'm not a big fan of the app for privacy and data mining reasons (but I digress).It has a joystick for pan and tilt as well as a button (left) for change the mode between portrait and landscape. At the left you have the focus knob and a zoom slide button below it. I should also mention that to my surprise the focus knob works pretty well and it's a neat way to manually bring objects into focus progressively.\u2261 ValueAll things considered, this is a fairly decent 3-axis gimbal for smart phones that's reasonably well-made and for the most part works as expected although the overall design of the clamp (and the motor in question) leaves something to be desired even at this price point. It's somewhat reasonably priced at $85 for what it provides, its overall build quality, usability, versatility, and performance. Your mileage might vary.",

                "reviewTitle": "If you are new to gimbals watch AOCHUAN videos first!",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Firstly I am new to gimbals so please take this review with that in mind. I got this hoping it would improve my video taking game. I was surprised by how many features there are with this! I also can't believe this is considered an \"entry\" model. It's really got a lot of features going for it! One misconception I had was thinking the gimbal will stabilize the video from shakes. This one doesn't really do that but because of gimbal designs it does allow you the capability to take smoother videos. Hopefully that makes sense \ud83d\ude42. Anyhow, I look forward having fun using this to make better videos!As a few other reviews mentioned, the instructions (or lack thereof) makes the gimbal a bit of challenge to use out of the box if you are a beginner. I highly recommend to watch AOCHUAN's YouTube channel. They provide a QR code in the instruction book. After watching the video I was able to install the app and connect my phone to the gimbal without any issues. It connects everytime, but may need a manual reconnect from the app should your phone go to sleep or you power off then on the gimbal. It's pretty easy.Another thing that may cause some \"confusion\", is the gimbal only has a few buttons but they perform multiple functions in some cases. For example pressing on the joystick selects different modes, double press power shows battery level, single click record changes starts/stops recording, and double click switches between portrait/landscape. AOCHUAN tried to make it easier by providing a cheat sheet on the gimbal itself.The gimbal uses a clamp to hold the phone. It's a nice design that tries it's best not to interfere with any side buttons of your phone. However, if you have a phone with a thicker case the clamp fingers may not be able to hold the phone tight enough. Your phone may pop out! You may have to take your phone out of the case, as an FYI.The gimbal is very compact. It can fold and secures closed magnetically. The gimbal also comes with a small tripod that can screw to the bottom of the gimbal handle. The tripod legs can also fold up to become a handle. This extends the existing handle if you want to use both hands to hold the gimbal. Additionally a small light is also included that can magnetically attach above or below the phone, facing either forward or backward. The light is really cool. For something so small it has a decent amount of light. It even does different color temperatures, and different colors! Oh, it's also rechargeable!!The gimbal motion is very smooth and silent. The joystick, depending on mode, can rotate the phone left/right, up/down or rotate it portrait/landscape. The speed of motion can be adjusted if you use the AOCHUAN app. There are lots of such adjustments in the app. The gimbal also has a knob to set focus (so you can fade in/out of focus) and a lever type switch to zoom in/out. Both these functions will only work with the AOCHUAN app. The app can also do face, body or object tracking! It works quite well! There is also gesture control so you can turn tracking on/off, etc. The app is really a requirement for using the gimbal to take advantage of all the features. Please be aware that AOCHUAN does collect some information if you are concerned about privacy, etc. I read most of the terms and they do collect more than what is shown in there Google Play store. This was a bit of a concern to me.I took some video moving the gimbal around. I found that when you sway back and forth there is a nice dampening effect. However I noticed it was a bit slow to rotate the phone around. There is also greater motion downward than upward as an FYI.You can use the gimbal with either left or right hand. I find it was harder to use my right hand as I could not comfortably reach the zoom lever. With right hand you can control the focus wheel with your index finger. If you hold the gimbal with your left hand both the focus wheel and zoom lever is accessible with your left thumb. But honestly I find it's just easier using two hands, one to hold and the other to turn the focus wheel, etc. The joystick, record button and power buttons can be easily used by one hand, either left or right.Battery life has been very good so far. After playing with this for a few hours the battery still shows 4 out of 4. The light unfortunately doesn't have a battery level indicator. It only has one LED showing power and as a charge indicator. Both the gimbal and light uses USB-C charging.Honestly I was very impressed with this gimbal. It is very well made with a good heft to it. Folded it is quite compact to easily take on vacation, etc. The magnetic light and tripod is very nice too. The AOCHUAN app is very full featured with face tracking, gesture control and many settings to adjust the gimbal. I just had a couple issues, the slower than expected rebound, depending how you hold it's easy to accidently hit the zoom, and lastly AOCHUAN app collects some more info than listed on Google Play (at least at time of this review). Over a very good entry gimbal.",
