This offers so much flexibility it's really impressive. The length is short enough that I can fit it into my travel sling but long enough that it is able to stand up securely. The legs flip out with a pull-apart action at the bottom of it. The top pulls up off the end and has forward and back tilting options which work great both in the selfie-stick and tripod configuration.The remote is quick and responsive and Bluetooth-pairing it was quick and easy. I have used it many times and have yet to recharge it.",

This extendable/selfie stick fits my needs perfectly. I absolutely love that it extends to 72 inches and that you can use your phone in either vertical or horizontal positions. The grip is quite comfortable and it comes with a remote and wrist strap which give added benefits. This is a great value for the price and I am very happy with this purchase!",
