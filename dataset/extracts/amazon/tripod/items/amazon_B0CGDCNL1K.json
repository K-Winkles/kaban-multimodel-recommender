                "reviewText": "Rock solid construction and great for my astronomy tripod setups. NO slop, NO super flexy, non-confidence inspiring hold, and I love the detents in the pivots! Makes it much easier in the dark to know if you've made much adjustment without turning lights on, which is a great way to mess with your night adapted eyes. The cold shoe mount and adapters really offer lots of versatility for mounting options. One thing to note is this mount is quite heavy for being constructed of full aluminum and took a bit of getting used to, making sure all my mounts and extension were up to task to keep things stable. The plastic stuff still can be handy in a pinch or as a spare in my kit bag, but the Atumtek has offered the best in mount security and robustness.",

                "reviewText": "As the quality and capabilities of mobile phone photography and videography have, in my opinion, now made possible professional caliber results, it becomes that much more important that the accessories used in production, enable the quality of images of which some phones are capable. You don\u2019t put a $15 needle on a $500 turntable.The Atumtek Phone Mount is just such a quality accessory; it is solidly built, versatile and can be used to mount a phone on a tripod, gimbal, camera hotshoe, or on an extension pole or table top tripod for hand held panning, blogging, etc.All contact surfaces are rubberized to protect the phone and there are coldshoe mounts on each end of the clamp itself that can be used to hold further accessories, for example a microphone or lighting. The clamp itself has plenty of depth and easily holds an iPhone 15 Pro Max while it is enclosed in a case.The side knob is used for tilting forward and backward and has definite detents that can be felt when tilting the clamp; I found that in order to tighten the tilt axis securely it is important to position it at a detent. The rear knob is loosened from its locked position so the clamped phone can be rotated in a 360-degree circle and there are eight definite detents within. Once locked down at a detent, both knobs hold the clamp securely and without play.The Atumtek has a variety of mounting options. The knurled knob at the bottom is used to lower and retract a hot/coldshoe mounting plate. When in its retracted position, the phone mount fits an Arca quick release clamp, or there is a standard \u00bc\u201d hole at the very bottom, typically used to mount a tripod. As well there are \u00bc\u201d holes on the back of the Atumtek that can be used to hold an external battery or SSD memory.It\u2019s nice to finally see a pro quality phone mounting option enter the marketplace, rather than all the plastic variations that seem to treat mobile phone image making as an afterthought. Stunning work is now being produced using mobile phones and the Atumtek Phone Tripod Mount is a perfect accessory to that end.",
