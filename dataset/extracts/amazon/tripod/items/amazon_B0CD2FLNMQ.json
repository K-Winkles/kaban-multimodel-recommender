I ended up not choosing this one solely because it would not get small enough to fit in my fanny pack.It is easy to open and set up, get your phone on and off and like I said before the white color is gorgeous. I tested it out with my iPhone 15 pro max and it seemed sturdy and good quality while still being light weight.",

Used it for family selfies and also as a tripod. The tripod feature is awesome. It is sturdy and was able to handle the weight of the 15 Pro Max. The phone holder has good grip. It was able to hold my phone all the time while walking about. The detachable USB-C rechargeable remote worked flawlessly. It was also easy to pair with my phone. It has a very stylish & expensive aesthetic. The only caveat of it being sturdy is that it is massive! It's a little over a foot when folded and 5\" in diameter. You have to carry it in a bag (it does NOT come with a carrier bag) - it will not fit in your pocket.",

La mini t\u00e9l\u00e9commande clips\u00e9e sur le manche est tr\u00e8s pratique et discr\u00e8te pour d\u00e9clencher le smartphone \u00e0 distance. Semble assez r\u00e9sistant et possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019orienter la t\u00eate en portrait ou paysage.",
