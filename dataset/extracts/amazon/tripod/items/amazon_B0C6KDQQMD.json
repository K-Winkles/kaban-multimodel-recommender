                "reviewText": "Overall this does what it aims to which is be a tripod or be a selfie stick and it does both very well!The only issue I have is that it is not very sturdy and good and staying still despite how hefty it looks and feels. The base is fine, it is the pole itself that wobbles slightly. For example, if you want to record a timelapse or video of some scenery, you press record on the phone and it wobbles back and forth a bit from the push before settling down. This affects what you record.It has a wireless Bluetooth remote that lets you take photos or videos from afar. It comes with the battery for the remote. Be warned though that it achieves this by simply being a volume button presser, so if you are taking photos or videos within an app that does not recognize the volume button as a valid capture button, it won't work for that, not a big deal though just capture on phone and upload to app.Overall a decent purchase and gets the job done.",
