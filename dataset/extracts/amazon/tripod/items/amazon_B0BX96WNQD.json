I ordered at a quick glance for the pricing & color.. it stretches out like 1-2ft above me (im 5\u20194) and is super compact, fits in my purse. It is SO worth the purchase. You can tilt your phone when it\u2019s set up, which I didn\u2019t think it would do! Also has a sturdy tripod bottom. I\u2019ll definitely repurchase in the future or gift to my friends who are content creators as well, or just enjoy taking pics/videos! 10/10 recommend!",
