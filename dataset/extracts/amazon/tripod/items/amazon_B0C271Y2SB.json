                "reviewText": "Someone previously said that the bag is to small for the tripod to fit in it, \"not true\" it is not to small when you disassemble the tripod like you're suppose to they must of forgot the fact that when you open the box that it comes in everything is in the bag, so I guess that would mean it fits in the bag.:)It works like it's suppose to, but is cheaply made of plastic of course what do you expect for 27 dollars come on people you will just need to be very careful with it it's that simple. It does work as it was intended to work, but I would have paid a little more to have a better product. Either way I need it for what it does, so if it breaks I will buy another one until someone comes out with something like this that is made better for a reasonable price. If you need it buy it that's my honest opinion, just don't expect to get something that will last for years to come.",
