This allows you to angle your phone up or down based on the shot you're aiming for. Whether it's a group selfie or a close-up of a flower, the tilt feature simplifies the process of achieving the perfect shot. Despite its numerous features, the iPhone holder for the tripod is surprisingly compact and lightweight. Its mini size ensures easy portability, allowing you to carry it wherever you go so that you never miss a photo opportunity. Despite its small size, the mount is remarkably durable, providing a secure and safe hold for your phone.",

I decided to look on Amazon and IMy ring light had an attachable phone stand that originally came with it, and the original phone mount I had ended up breaking over time. I decided to look on Amazon, and I found this to be compatible with my ring light. I was very pleased with the cost and how stable/sturdy it feels. My only critique is that it doesn\u2019t have full 360 free motion. It stops at every 90\u00b0 angle, but that doesn\u2019t affect much for me. My phone does not sit perfectly straight, but I can bend my ring, light to accommodate, so I can\u2019t complain. I just wanted to make that note.",
