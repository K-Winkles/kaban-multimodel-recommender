                "reviewText": "I keep this at my parents' house, as we like to get pictures of everyone - especially the children - over the years. The pictures then go into the electronic picture frame and they really appreciate it.This tripod works well with any phone we've had, and it is so much better than trying to balance the phone on a chair or swapping someone out over multiple pictures.The unit is actually small enough that I just put it in the corner behind the TV so it's always handy. I just grab it, put the phone in the spring-loaded jaws, and put it on a stool or the counter to frame the picture. Using the timer on the phone I can then get in the picture as well. Family pictures are important!",

                "reviewText": "At first I thought this was fine for what I needed. Sometime later, I noticed the pins that hold the legs in, have nothing that keep the pins in. So eventually the pins will slide out. I noticed this when one of the legs fell out, and another leg was close to falling out because its pin was also missing. The 3rd leg would be next as the last pin left was on its way out. This is a really stupid design that means its not meant for long time use.",

How is that?The answer: I don\u2019t have to hold the phone, and I can take it and wrap it around something to hold the camera. wrapping around some thing in order to stabilize. The camera hasn\u2019t been an issue. I haven\u2019t had to use that little handy feature but if I ever do, it\u2019s there. But as a typical tripod, it works perfectly and it\u2019s small enough so I can use it and just prop it on my bed and talk away!.",
