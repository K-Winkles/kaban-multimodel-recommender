Lugging around SLR cameras, lenses, and various other equipment has been a part of my life for decades. What's really changed everything for a photography lover is the evolution of smartphones into really good cameras. And, unlike SLRs, you literally always have it with you when a great shot presents itself.This combination selfie stick/tripod is a great addition for those of us who take photography seriously. Having a small, lightweight, yet sturdy tripod that you take with you everywhere adds a welcome dimension to phone photography. When this product is compacted, and the phone holder is removed, it's quite small and relatively lightweight. It comes with a carry sack with a long cord that you can sling over your shoulder for easy carrying. I have a small rucksack that I carry when I take my 2 dogs for hikes in the local woods, and it fits easily into that.Once I did it a couple of times, I found the product easy and quick to assemble and expand to full size. It telescopes to just over 5 feet, but you can adjust it to any height that you need for a particular task. The base is made out of plastic, which keeps the weight down, but it's still quite sturdy. I've used aluminum tripods for years with my photography hobby. They're sturdier than this one, but their weight makes them challenging to lug around. This tripod is remarkably sturdy for being made of plastic, and the reduction in weight makes it much easier to carry. It's a worthwhile compromise giving up a bit of sturdiness for lighter weight. The phone attachment adjusts, turns, and tilts to whatever angle you need for the shot, and holds that expensive smartphone securely.I don't take many selfies with just me, but I do like to take them in group settings, as when out with friends and family. The included remote shutter release is perfect for that task. It pairs via Bluetooth to your phone, and worked immediately with my Android phone's camera with no further adjustments. No longer is there a need to approach a stranger to ask them to shoot your group, only to discover that your volunteer doesn't understand the first thing about taking a shot. I can set up my own shots and include myself in them without the need to dislocate my shoulder trying to hold my phone out far enough to shoot my whole group.This product is excellent. The entire included kit is well thought out and nicely made. It's extremely functional and reasonably priced. It's up there at the top of my favorite products I had the opportunity to try out this year.",

                "reviewText": "Ordered this tripod main for traveling. I don't want to carry too many accessories these day when traveling. Just want to have something like this. It is a selfish stick and tripod combo. It is extremely convenient when I want to do hyperlapse with my insta360. I use it with a quick release adapter so I can swap different devices in seconds.The overall quality is fairly good. The tripod was made out of plastic. Seems sturdy. I wish it was aluminum/ metal. Because it feels better in hand. It is around 60in when fully extended. When fully extended, it will become wobbly so make sure you put asome weights on the bottom otherwise it will fall.Pros:- 62 inches when fully extended- comes with a remote- remote can be mount directly on the base of the tripod- sturdy construction- ballhead design for max flexibility- metal extension rod- comes with phone holderCons:- tripod base is made out of plastic, feels sturdy- the on/ off button on the remote is difficult to reach when mounted on the tripod. Wish the make the opening wider.- phone holder is screw tightening. Very slow to mount the phone.",

                "reviewText": "I am definitely a fan of this tripod/selfie stick. The base of this device is a thick round handle that opens up into a tripod. The three legs are thick and sturdy, and provides a remarkable sturdy base. There is a knurled ring that I you must loosen completely to spread the legs (the easiest way I have found to do this is from the ends/tips of the legs). Then tighten the ring down again to secure the legs. The main pole is telescopic, and does extend up 60+ inches, which I found remarkable. The pole is sturdy and held my iPhone 15 MaxPro\u2019s weight without any issues, and I wasn\u2019t worrying about it tipping over. The phone holder was easy to secure around my fairly large phone as well. (It also comes with a GoPro attachment but I don\u2019t have that kind of camera so I can\u2019t speak to its effectiveness.)I was afraid that the size of the handle would preclude it from working well as a selfie stick, but it works quite well. The entire thing is remarkably lightweight, so I found that if I held near the top of the main handle, it served as a pretty decent counterbalance to the weight of the phone on the other end. Since the main pole extends even with the legs folded, it works really well as a selfie stick.It also comes with a detachable remote, which was easy to pair to my phone and worked flawlessly. There is a tiny on/off switch to preserve the battery, which I did have trouble noticing it at first, but I\u2019m glad it is there! There is also a holder on the side of the legs, which puts in in the perfect spot when using as a selfie stick.The carry bag is a pretty flimsy plastic, but I did appreciate that it was long enough for the stick even with the phone holder attached to the tripod. Overall, I am thrilled with this product!",
