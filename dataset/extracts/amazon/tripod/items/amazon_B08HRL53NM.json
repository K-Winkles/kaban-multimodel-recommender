                "reviewText": "My first impression of this selfie stick tripod is that it is a very sleek, thoughtfully engineered design. The remote is stored flush in the handle. The legs of the tripod unfold easily at the push of a button. The tripod extends just by pulling it out of the top. The phone mount turns and locks in essentially in every position you need it to, and the grip holds my iPhone securely. It\u2019s very easy and intuitive to use, and used as a selfie stick tripod I would definitely purchase it again having seen it in person. Quite lovely!Instead of using it as intended, however, I\u2019m using it to hold my Infant Optics DXR-8 baby monitor camera. Engineer mama needed a solution that didn\u2019t mount directly to the crib, rely on 3M sticky anything, or require drilling of any holes in my wall. I had the idea of using a regular tripod since there is a hole in the camera base for a screw mount. While searching for a suitable tripod, I stumbled on this model and figured I\u2019d give it a try. Happy to say it works for my needs perfectly!It holds the camera sitting on the base when it\u2019s perpendicular and flipped up (1st photo). It would be better if the flat support was perhaps half an inch wider just for peace of mind, but it\u2019s used while stationary and it\u2019s not wiggling around or otherwise unstable. I opted to attach the crib mount I was using on the crib previously and secure it to the tripod\u2019s phone mount (2nd photo), which allows me to angle the camera down without worrying about gravity. I also secured the cable to the pole arm with white Velcro cable ties so it looks much tidier (3rd photo).I can now see inside my baby\u2019s crib and he can\u2019t reach the cable or camera anymore, so that\u2019s a total win in my book! Best of all, I can use it for its intended purpose as a selfie stick/tripod AND it\u2019s supremely portable as the baby camera mount, since it folds so small. My only wish is that it was a few inches taller, as I have to have the tripod further than baby arms length away, but it\u2019s a minor issue that could be remedied by elevating it with a box or something. It works as is.Very happy!!!",

The Bluetooth remote is conveniently attached to the tripod and works very well. The only other thing is that I wish it were a bit more sturdy where you put your iPhone for when i want to use an iPhone light. It gets too heavy and tips down so you can\u2019t get the right angle.

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Fulfills a real need for the casual mobile phone photographer!",
                "reviewText": "Mobile phone camera technology has now come so far that, unless you\u2019re a photography buff, it\u2019s hard to justify the time, effort, and expense of a dedicated camera for the average family. That\u2019s not a knock on those who are passionate about high-quality photography equipment. I\u2019m just saying that millions of us get by on our cell phone cameras exclusively. We\u2019re one demographic where this product makes total sense and fulfills a legitimate need.One thing my family does every Christmas is dress up in matching pajamas (even the dog) and take some pictures sitting in front of the Christmas tree. I can still picture myself last Christmas stacking boxes and books to get my phone precarious perched at just the right height. I\u2019d then set the time for 10 seconds, run over to my spot, and try to compose myself enough to look normal in the shot. When I saw this baby, I knew those days were over! The tripod is just what I needed for these moments and the Bluetooth remote means I can control the shutter and don\u2019t have to dash to my spot! This is a nice solution for the casual mobile phone photographer who needs a tripod every now and then.Another demographic to whom this product makes a lot of sense is travelers. Once again many of us will exclusively use our mobile phones to capture memories when traveling. Products like this mobile tripod enable us to do this well. This unit is lightweight and no problem to carry through cities or to drop in a backpack as we hit the trails. We\u2019re then ready to take great shots during our travels. I never mind when someone asks me to take a photo of them. However, I\u2019m a bit hesitant to ask for the same assist. Armed with this tripod and Bluetooth remote, I never have to. The tripod is ideal for many types of shots too. On a recent family camping trip, I thought it would be cool to have a timelapse of the entire setup. The correct settings on my phone, sitting atop this tripod delivered great results. The selfie stick/mobile tripod can definitely accommodate large cell phones as I\u2019ve been using the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra with mine.Yet another demographic that would find this product incredibly useful is content creators & and influencers. My wife\u2019s side hustle is being a pampered chef associate. This means that she often films products & and cooking demos. The flexibility of this tripod (adjustable height, phone position, phone angle, portrait/landscape, etc) means she can get just the right angle she needs. The fact that it\u2019s so quick to adjust has helped her up her content game by getting multiple angles during a given session. She mentioned that she may even buy another tripod and always capture two angles (one with her phone and one with mine). The portability of this unit means content creators can capture the moment almost anytime and anywhere.In summary, this selfie stick/mobile tripod is an excellent tool for the millions of us who use our smartphones as our primary tool for capturing videos and photos both at home and whilst traveling. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "I've gone through my fair share of selfie sticks of various brands, weights, features, sizes, etc.This is by far the largest and longest one. But it's also the most sturdy. It's not going to blow over at the slightest breeze. It's pretty long and a little bulky but still easily fits in my Pacsafe Slingpack.The only minor issue I have with this selfie stick is that the mount swivels in 45-degree increments. It's a minor issue in landscape mode because you can rotate the entire tripod. However, if you need to go into portrait mode (i.e. tilt the mount 90 degrees), the 45-degree incremental rotations can be a pain. That said, this product still does the job and mostly does it well.WARNING!: Be careful when using this in public, as this can easily and often be mistaken for an adult toy! lolIt's not obvious in the pictures, but it will probably be your first thought when you open the box ;-)As other reviewers have mentioned, the best thing about this product is its customer support/service.My mount had somehow broken and after providing proof of purchase and pictures of the damage, they were quick to send a replacement. If anyone has ever broken a selfie stick (I'm pretty sure we all have), this should give you peace of mind - at least during the warranty period.PROS:- long, very long- sturdy- aesthetic design- awesome customer service and warrantyCONS:- a little bulky- a little long when completely closed- looks like an adult toy (maybe PRO for some? :-)",
