I set it up today with my fairly heavy picture taker, and I was blown away by how smooth and secure everything feels. I didn't think much of it for the price, but this is a well designed and crafted instrument. Slight adjustments are easy. I recycled my last tripod because the frustration of jerky movement and lack of finesse ruined my whole thing. This thing is lovely. It was made with care by good people who love to make others happy. It is a light weight thing, mind you, so don't go thinking you can use it for your 40 foot telescope, but I was impressed with how stable it held my D810. The ball joint tightened easily with zero sag. All the joints in the legs can be placed so nicely. The shoulders gave me a bit of a fight, but once it made me see things its way, I completely agree that it should be like that. Anyway, I'm just on my way to buy the more expensive one, because I am super curious what they think is more valuable than this gem.",

                "reviewText": "Im actually surprised at the quality of the head I can get at this price range!I needed something small and compact for quick shoots in my studioI have a Lumix G85 m4/3 camera mounted on this stand and did some simple panning shot, it was really easy with the handle.Here are the pluses and minuses:+ pluses:. light weight and smaller when folded up than some of my bigger tripods but still opens to standard height (cant get very tall though). decent ball head with very fluidic panning. the handle can be taken off and put on the otherside so you can change it around so that the knobs for adjustments arent blocking battery door... this is one of the biggest plus of this tripod. quick release locking plate locks in fairly tight, no wobbles, very secure. legs can be folded quickly. has weight hook and bubble level on both ball head adjustment knob (so you know you are leveled when doing portraits) and on the tripod body. decent quality bag, not much cushioning but good durable fabric- minuses:. most things are cost down to bare minimum but they still work well so not much of a complaint for the price (including height adjustment knob but they even included a replacement!). the bag has a very simple string strap, not that great for wearing on shoulders but to be expected at this price rangeat the end of the day, this is a great tripod for the price, especially that beautiful looking ball head actually functions like a $80-100 ball headso getting the whole tripod for under $40, i consider it a great dealand guess what, if you dont like the tripod, just take the ball head off and mount it on another tripodor not, just it as is. I find it absolutely fine for indoor use.one of the best budget purchase i have done for my camera",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m pleasantly surprised by this little tripod. It\u2019s small and lightweight but it seems well-made and sturdy.When I first took it out of case and set it up I experienced that same \u201cwobble\u201d that another buyer noted in a video. My first thought was to send it back but I decided to check out all the features first, and I\u2019m glad I did.I fixed the wobble simply by tightening the ball head lock and turning the ball head as far as it would go then tightening the knob again. No wobble, steady as a rock.I\u2019m impressed by the neat features in this little tripod, especially for the price. The legs spread out for low shooting and the center column comes out and flips upside down for macro shooting.There\u2019s even a retractable \u201cstabilization\u201d hook on the center column for adding weight to steady the tripod when it\u2019s windy, etc.The legs have easy flip locks and the locks that flatten the legs are simple to use as well.My first impression of the quick release plate was that I didn\u2019t think it was sturdy and I wouldn\u2019t trust my DSLR and lens on it. No worries. It\u2019s solid as a rock and simple to use.Since this is right out of the box obviously I haven\u2019t used in the real world yet. However, I don\u2019t see any issue with it at all, and I look forward to having a lightweight, functional tripod with me always. I\u2019ve missed some great opportunities because I didn\u2019t have a tripod with me but no more. Even though I have a very nice smaller Manfrotto with legs that also drop for low angle shooting, it\u2019s still weighty enough that I usually don\u2019t take it with me unless I need it for fireworks and other shoots like that.This little gem will be either in my bag, in my trunk, or over my shoulder all the time.With all the features for the money I doubt you can beat it. Buy it.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for an entry level tripod for my sister in law who has just started a side business for maternity shots. I knew she was on a strict budget but did not want to compromise on the quality. This particular tripod fit the budget and we were excited to test it out to see the quality. The material is quite sturdy and was able to withhold the weight of the canon T3i canon rebel camera. Having some experience with higher end tripod I still wanted to look for a quick release plate and a compact tripod. This becomes easily portable and this was very important as this will be needed and used in different locations. In total it is about 2 pounds which is comparably lighter than other tripods I have used in the past. A travel bag is also included so you do not have to go and purchase more items to make this tripod portable. The height is also adjustable up to 49 inches so that is a good thing to keep in mind depends on the nature of photography/videography. I will definitely recommend this tripod for entry-level especially students who are on a budget but want to get into purchasing equipment.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. WHAT I LIKE:\u27a0 Reasonable build quality, given the price.\u27a0 Packs up pretty small, and is quite lightweight.\u27a0 Comes with a decent carrying pouch.\u27a0 The included ballhead has a quick release plate, which is super handy when you need to remove the camera from the tripod often.\u27a0 Given how small it packs down, it has a good height range, and extends to a decent maximum height. It certainly won\u2019t go close to eye level (unless you\u2019re really short), but that would be tough to expect from such a compact tripod. And going to 49\u201d is still way better than those mini tripods that only go a foot off the ground.\u27a0 I love how versatile it is - for example, the feature that allows you to mount it upside down and get it super close to the ground can come in super useful for interesting perspectives and for macro photography.\u27a0 The included ballhead moves smoothly for the price (I have ones that move more smoothly, but they are way more expensive).\u27a0 The 360 degree rotation feature on the base of the ballhead is great for making small rotation adjustments without having to reposition the whole head. It\u2019s also useful for panoramic photos.\u27a0 The ballhead is removable, so you can use any ballhead that you\u2019d like.\u27a0 The control arm is removable, so you can take it off if you don\u2019t like / need it.\u27a0 The leg lock clips are plasticky, but work smoothly and seem to be secure.WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED:\u27a0 Although the suggested load capacity for this tripod is 7 lbs, I\u2019m not sure how well it would do with that much weight on it. I\u2019ve put my Nikon D810 with 24-70mm f2.8 lens on there - which only weighs about 4.5 lbs - and already at that point, it\u2019s getting pretty close to its limit. It doesn\u2019t feel rock solid with that much weight on it. For example, I suspect it wouldn\u2019t give super sharp images when doing long exposures - especially with a telephoto lens, where vibrations are magnified - as I think even a slight breeze would cause small vibrations. Also, I doubt the ballhead could support a heavy, front-balanced lens, such as a medium sized telephoto, without creeping. The absolute maximum load that is indicated for this tripod is 11 lbs - but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d put that much weight on it.\u27a0 The legs tend to close by themselves quite easily. It would be great if there was more tension on the leg angle adjustments to reduce this.OVERALL IMPRESSION: For those looking for a compact tripod for their phone, point and shoot, mirrorless camera, or small dSLR (with small to medium sized lens), that goes to about chest height and has lots of useful features, this tripod offers great value. But if you\u2019re using a heavier rig, and are looking for a high level of stability to do things like long exposures, it may not be sturdy enough. I intend to use this as a dedicated tripod for my phone, and think it\u2019s great for that purpose.",
