                "reviewText": "This feels like a real upgrade from the flexible tripod I had before without even costing that much more money.One problem with my old tripod is that it didn't have a plate to stabilize my webcam. You just screwed the webcam into the part connected to the ball mechanism and it didn't feel very stable. Plus you couldn't get it tight because once it's screwed on all the way the ball just spins.This one gets around that problem where the mounting bolt is attached to a plate that has its own dial to tighten it. Much more stable. And I love that the plate can be popped open to convert into a cellphone holder.Overall very impressed with this product. Tremendous value for the money.",

                "reviewText": "For the price this tripod is great quality and a nice design. I think the head is clever and versatile. The only issue is that the head can come loose from the legs fairly easily, a bit of rubber padding between the two would help it stay tight (it is just metal against metal).I think the legs are better than a Gorrilapod for long term durability (no troublsome joints that can become loose), although they cannot bend and grip quite like a Gorillapod. At first I was a bit disappointed that it didn't seems capable of grabbing onto posts/railings/branches very strongly, but then I learned that you can use a lot of force when wrapping it around things and then it can grab quite well. I just wouldn't say that it can support an SLR camera on a round horizontal bar, it will flop over under such weight without anything else to stabilize the legs. A possible improvement to the design (for those who want to use it for grabbing onto things) would be to cover the legs in big rubber rings, similar to a Gorillapod's legs.",
