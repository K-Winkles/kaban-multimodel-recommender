                "reviewText": "This (AM-223) is a very short tripod, not a full sized tripod, not something you will use to take family pictures, not something you will use to sit on the ground and take pictures of fireworks, or pics of the sunset. Well ... unless you want to bend over a lot.However, I'm SOOOOOO glad someone finally made a ROCK SOLID small tripod!!! I like to hike, backpack, and shoot nature - flowers, animals, waterfalls, etc.. My full sized tripods (Benro, Manfrotto, etc) have great stability ... total pain to heft those guys some of the places I go. So I don't. I've got a several Al and carbon travel tripods from similar level manufacturers. They are good, but still a bit bulky/long and really, I never extend the legs beyond maybe one segment as extending more they cross that line of adequate stability IMHO. And I have to rework them and/or remove the center column so they can go low. Then there are those table-top versions that are compact and light but are flimsy even from decent brands. And the heads on those ... can we even call those \"heads\"...?? Makes me want to cry. That's where this guy comes in. Even though it's far more compact than my travel tripods, it's more stable d/t larger leg diameter and overall beefier construction. Finally, a short/small/compact tripod that is rock solid.It holds a FF DSLR (ie Nikon D750) with a decent sized lens (ie 70-200F2.8 using the collar mount of course, 105F2.8 micro, even my 135mmF2DF... etc.) without any problem. For mirrorless, I shoot SONY and use MFT when I'm going light; for those it's more than solid, no problem with anything I've got for those including fast telephotos.Works with my dozens of different brands (some cheap-o no-names) Arca plates - locks them all down tight. Ball head is solid and smooth (not RRS or Kirk, or such, but on par with similar brands/price). No creep, even with heavier setup and in vertical. Legs flatten out so goes as low as any other tripod I have, and is very stable with legs 'flat.'I've used it for 4-5 months (I typically wait to write reviews until I've really put an item through it's paces...) and it's holding up and functioning great. No concerns about quality, durability, or function.Fantastic compact tripod. If you need elevation to sitting/standing position, then go with the typical carbon or Al travel tripod - there are lots of those, including larger models in this line. If you don't need much elevation AND you want compact BUY THIS ONE! I've been looking for/ waiting for this guy for 30 years!!",

                "reviewText": "So, I had to do some heavy analyzing as to which tripod would be best suited for my needs. I shoot on my desk for talking head, the gym, parking lot, and mostly close to mid range shots. Now, I like to carry/travel light weight and with minimal gear. Additionally, I make sure to purchase equipment that performs optimally and offer flexibility/versatility.The AM 225 and ST 125 are by far the best affordable carbon fiber tripods out there and well suited for my needs. I go over the details on my video but for this section, all I can say is that I opted for the ST 125 and the AM 223 (for talking head/table footage).The ST 125 is slightly taller (folded; ~1.5\"), thicker (~1\"), and heavier (~100g) than the AM 225 as well. However, its not by much. The ST 125 may be a bit pricer (~$70 more) but it offers a triangular center column for that added height and security, thicker legs for stability, and is waterproof. One con is that it does not include a ball head (BK 00). I use that one and love it, by the way. Super smooth.But all of theses features are one unit whereas the AM 225 only reaches about 50\". To get that extra height, you got to buy SIRUI's center column (100). This was not ideal for me as it would add unnecessary steps and more equipment to carry.Both are great. It does depend on you and purpose. Even if I had it as a gift, I just wouldn't see why I should keep it when the ST 125 does it all so well. I hope this was helpful. Thanks for reading my review.",

                "reviewText": "This is my third tripod made by Sirui. I wanted this one specifically for backpacking. I need a lightweight tripod that can support a full frame camera. The legs are great and what you expect because they are sturdy and lightweight. They work.But the little feet fell off. First one got randomly lost. Then a second one I found halfway unscrewed. So I just gave up and took off all three little feet. It's annoying that there is this extra part (the feet) which don't offer much and then came off on their own.The ball head is not light. It's not great. I switched it out. Everybody tries to make a sturdy metal ball head because they think we all want that. Well I already have several like that and they are heavy. I want one that is plastic and lightweight because I'm only using it on special trips where weight is critical.So.... mixed review. I still use this because the legs are excellent.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this version of the Sirui am2 series tripods. The 284 is the same as the 254 except it has the thicker studier legs.I was carrying an excellent aluminium tripod for most birding shots, and a tiny carbon one for low down (because the metal one had a centre column) - this setup worked well, but the longer you walk the more you feel the weight. I have replaced both with this tripod.Plus points:- No central column so can be lowered super low- Really sturdy legs so even works with my heavy 450mm lens- Lovely leg release and locks, large and grippy and easy to use- Two sizes of screw included for mounting a head- Comes with the keys and spiked feetDownside:- Only 120cm at highest, but as I am a short a*r$e not an issue for me, i use mostly from sitting postion, and even so once the gimbal is on then a large lens mounted to it, it is more like 145cm to the viewfinder. You can buy a centre column extender which effectively removes this as an issue- Leg hinges are a little stiff to open, but they supply a key to relax them - I prefer stiff so I can carry by the legs",
