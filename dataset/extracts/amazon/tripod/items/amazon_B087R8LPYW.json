I read a lot of reviews on various stands with flexible goosenecks, this one stood above the rest.There are *always* negative reviews of anything, so you have to discount some of them. Or at least pay attention to which product has the least number of negative reviews.A big feature for me with this stand is it comes with a Bluetooth remote to trigger a shot. Any good photographer knows if you want truly sharp pictures, you want your camera to be perfectly still. The remote allows me to keep my fingers off the camera so it shoots while being absolutely motionless.The grip for the phone is a bit tight. But that's a good thing as you don't have to worry about your phone falling out it, no matter what orientation it's at.",
