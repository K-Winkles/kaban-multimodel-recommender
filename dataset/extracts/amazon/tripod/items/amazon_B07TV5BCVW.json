                "reviewText": "This is a pretty dissent selfie stick. It holds up firmly against the weight of my Galaxy 21S+ with no issues. It is light enough to not exhaust the hand, but hardy enough to not crumble under the weight of the phone. On several occasions, I've used it to take photos and videos for hours at a time and surprised videographers using heavy tripods. I like the fact that it can be used as a stand, so you can use the timer on the phone camera and be part of a group photo. The stick is also comfortable to carry by hand. I've held it in my hands on international flights and never had any issues with customs.The only thing to watch is the remote, particularly when dislodged from the stick. It is very small and light, and chances are that you could lose it easily. Other than that, if you aren't careless and misplace the remote, you will have a stick to enjoy for a long time. In fact, I've found the remote to hold the charge longer than the phone while I am actively taking pictures.",

                "reviewText": "I recently underwent cataract surgery on both eyes, and my new lenses both have a focal range between 8 and 18 inches, so I an unable to watch TV until my eyes are fully healed and I can get new prescription glasses for distance, which is about six weeks out. I purchased this item so that I can watch videos on my smart phone, and it is ideal for this purpose. It comes with a small \"Bluetooth\" switch, that when paired with a smartphone, will allow you to remotely activate the shutter when using the stick to take selfies. A couple of things to know about this unit: It has three legs built into the base to allow it to be used as a tripod, and the way to extend those feet is to telescope the stick to it's maximum length. It is important to note that if you try to pull the tripod legs out of the base without extending the telescoping sections all the way first, the folding tripod leg mechamisms can be damaged. The jaws on the end of the stick have a very strong sping to clamp the phone securely. There is no chance that the phone can come loose while attached to the stick, but one downside is that the spring is so strong it can be difficult to remove the phone without putting excessive force on the tiny tilt. The telescoping sections are very tight/snug to each other too, but that ensures that once the desired extension length is set, the distance placement won't slip or vary. Overall, a great deal of thought went into the engineering of this fine tool, and the quality of the fabrication craftsmanship is excellent, but in normal use, whilst pulling on the sections or clamp springs, one must constantly be aware that the tiny hinge at the tip is somewhat fragile and should not be overly twisted or torqued. But if you are careful, and treat it like a wristwatch or fishing pole, this can be a useful instrument for many years.",

                "reviewText": "I already have two selfie sticks, both a couple years old. The newer features on more recent models such as this one make the old sticks obsolete.For example, my old selfie sticks did not have bluetooth remote control built in, requiring a third party little remote. The watch battery in this was shot and a replacement battery is more than $5. By contract, this unit has bluetooth remote built in and it is USB RECHARGEABLE. No more battery replacements. Worth the cost right there.In addition, the bluetooth remote is incorporated into the handle so I no longer have to fumble with both the selfie stick and a remote while trying to get the perfect selfie. Again, worth the cost right there.The BT remote also can be removed from the handle so that if instead you set this selfie stick up as a tripod and step away from it, you can still hold the remote in your hand.Perhaps best of all, this unit collapses into a very tight and tidy package that can fit in a pocket or a small purse, so it can always be with you and at the ready while not being bulky and inconvenient to keep on hand.Fit and finish are terrific, it feels like a high quality aluminum. Everything feels a little too stiff and resistive when expanding and contracting, to the point I am afraid I am pulling or pushing so hard I might break something, but I imagine that will loosen up a bit with use. If it loosens up a little it will be great and if it loosens up too much it may become a bit sloppy and clumsy. It is built and designed so well, however, that I am optimistic they designed it well and it will loosen it's joints just a bit with time and use.Excellent product, even more so given the very reasonable price.",

Es compacto, ligero y cuenta con un pr\u00e1ctico mando a distancia integrado, ideal para no usar el temporizador. Adem\u00e1s, es resistente y estable, tanto como palo selfie como tr\u00edpode. La extensi\u00f3n podr\u00eda ser un pel\u00edn m\u00e1s larga. Su tama\u00f1o lo hace perfecto para guardar en cualquier bolso. Cumple todas las expectativas y es ideal para viajes por su tama\u00f1o. Regal\u00e9 dos y quedaron encantados. Despu\u00e9s de tres a\u00f1os, siguen funcionando perfectamente y sin mostrar marcas de uso.",
