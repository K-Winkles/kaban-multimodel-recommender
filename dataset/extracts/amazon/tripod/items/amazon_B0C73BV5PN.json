This seems like a very happy middle ground between lighter weight or entry level tripods, and the too-expensive true professional units.The overall sturdiness is excellent. My previous tripod, I was happy to use my phone or a gopro on top, but this here is also stable and reliable enough to go with a real camera or camcorder as well. The overall feel of it is confidence-inspiring. The adjustments are straightforward and lock in well. Smooth action. Versatile angling.The included phone mount is simple but nice. It has more padding than the one included with my previous tripod, and offers more protection for the phone. I don't have to worry about scuffs and scratches. Highly appreciated.VERDICT:Very nice overall. It will not compete with 100 USD+ tripods, but as an entry point into \"real, good\" photography gear, it's a good value recommendation.",

                "reviewText": "I have to admit that I was expecting to be disappointed. This tripod is over 80% plastic; however, I was pleasantly surprised regarding the engineering of the plastic parts. The leg clamps work great, the swivel and pivot lock positively and the locking collar for the footprint spread works really good. The trapezoid shaped legs are constructed of four segments of aluminum. This is very unusual as most tripods consist of three segmented legs. The end of the tripod legs can be fitted with (supplied) rubber pivoting feet. The rubber feet seem to be adjustable for making micro adjustments for a solid, level, camera platform. The tripod has a built in 360 degree level to help achieve a true horizontal perspective without tilt. With the legs fully extended and the platform to the full height, this tripod can be adjusted unusually high. The set up is so high that this tripod could be used for a white refraction umbrella. The tripod can be adjusted to have a very wide footprint to help stabilize it when heavy equipment is attached to it. There is even an inverted hook for hanging a small sandbag for further support in windy conditions. Although I'm not a big fan of plastic, this tripod has obviously been designed by someone in the professional photography industry. There are almost infinite adjustment options, and those adjustments stay put when you tighten them down. I almost forgot to mention that this also comes with an adapter to hold your cell phone as if it was a SLR Camera.",

                "reviewText": "I use this tripod as a replacement for one I had a FLIR camera on for my home golf simulator. This tripod works great, it feels well built and honestly feels the same as some 80$+ Tripods I have bought in the past. The tripod is pretty light weight, around 3 lbs, has 4 levels of adjustment on each leg (usually I feel like tripods only have 3) the feet at the bottom are anti-slip with a rubber material, and the areas where you would grab the tripod to move it around have a nice soft foam padding on them. There are some touch points like the handle for articulation that are just plastic and could feel a bit better, but for the price I completely am fine with it and will continue using this as long as it holds up.",

                "reviewText": "Das Stativ macht einen stabilen Eindruck. Man kann es beschweren mit einem Gewicht. F\u00fcr das wof\u00fcr ich es brauche, ist das aber nicht notwendig.Das schnell einspannen. Der handyhalterung funktioniert tadellos und die Feder ist stark genug. Ich benutze sie mit einem Google Pixel 6 pro.Das Stativ steht stabil. Jedoch die M\u00f6glichkeit mit der Kurbel noch mal ein St\u00fcck hochzufahren, w\u00fcrde ich sein lassen, denn dieses St\u00fcck ist etwas gargellig.Beim zusammenbauen( die F\u00fcsse einschrauben) sollten sie eine wasserpumpenzange oder \u00e4hnliches zur Hand haben, denn ab einem gewissen Grad wird es sehr schwer und das ist nicht mehr mit den Fingern zu schaffen.Nach dem ersten praxistest werde ich eventuell die Rezession ver\u00e4ndern oder noch mal best\u00e4tigen.",
