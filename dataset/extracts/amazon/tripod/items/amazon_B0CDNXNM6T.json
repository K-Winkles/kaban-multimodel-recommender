                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Got this for my home video making needs. Overall, I loved this phone tripod for its quality. Superior built and comes as a complete combo. Functions very well too and is highly recommended to anyone. Looks wise also it is nice with a graphite carbon matt finish.My 2 cents below:Pros:- Height extends from 18.8 to 67 inches & is very helpful to adjust as per your photography needs - The phone clamp can extend between 2.8\" to 4.8\" width-wise, so it should fit any small/medium/large phone device even when a case is on- Clamp has a strong grip & easy to operate overall- Tripod is very sturdy & stable overall on the floor while using - Has dedicated iOS & Android buttons in the Bluetooth remote. I have iPhone so the iOS button works - Rugged material and a nice finish that gives a great look overall- Well built product & feels durable- Comes already assembled and nothing to be done other than putting the phone mount- When folded, it is a small form factor product and hence great for portability reasons too- Very reasonably priced (Got for ~$17 including taxes & with the available coupon) for the quality & the feature Cons:- None that I see for this price & the quality",

                "reviewText": "This is an awesome phone tripod, especially for what you are getting for the price. Very small and portable when collapsed with a nice little carrying bag that is included, but extends further than most other tripods I've seen on the market, making it super versatile. The legs can be locked in different stages of opening and closing so that you can fit it in tight diameter spots. They are not individually height adjustable, but you can make up for a weird angle with the flexible neck mount that is included. The extending clamp for the phone stretches pretty far and holds securely without worry of it dropping my phone, and it's got a rubber grip that is padded so it feels like my phone is protected. The remote worked perfectly after pairing without any additional steps needed. Hit the button once for a photo or to start/stop video if you are in video mode, and if you hold the button down it will take short clips until you depress it. The angles for the phone are also adjustable if you are using the the top knob without the flexible extension as well, so you still have a lot of use out of this without having to install that piece if you don't want to. The adjustable height isn't notched or anything either, so you can get it to the exact height you are looking for as well. All in all, this thing is fantastic, absolutely love it, and highly recommended!",
