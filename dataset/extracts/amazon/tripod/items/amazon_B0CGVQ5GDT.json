                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought this because my daughter is always on video calls with her friends and setting her phone down. I thought this would be a fun little tool for her to allow them to track her while she's constantly moving around. I didn't think how nifty this little device could be just for funIt does come with a little photo-taking remote which I didn't exactly use but would come in handy for capturing pictures from afar (Bluetooth linked)The base pad had rubber feet, unlike many other tripods I've used that slide around in some places. At least this will hold in place pretty well.Pros:- Can hold devices as small as GoPro and as big as my S23 Ultra with a big case- Adjustable to be portrait or landscape, also can flip over if you were capturing a video of someone else and wanted to watch as they were moving around without getting in the way- The base unscrews and allows you to put it on a camera tripod (I didn't have one to reference)- Has visual hand controls (can hold a hand out and will stop tracking, or OK sign to start tracking again)- For the price, this does more than some high-dollar items- Best for areas without little background movements- Rechargeable with provided USB-C cable (need power block or plug)- Compact enough to fit in most handbags or otherwise- No syncing or Setup required (minus remote)Cons:- Is glitchy at times for movement- Standing too close can throw off tracking- Tends to track any movement causing it to move (don't toss your arms/hands around)Overall: This isn't one of those few hundred-dollar trackers, but for the cost and capability, I am really impressed. Easy to move around and can be used for many things. Is it perfect? No, but for simple things like my daughter using it for calls, ya it may work great. It may even be useful for capturing video while out in the yard, where you are moving around a lot and want to catch it. It's a bit jumpy on movements and may not track very fast movements up close, but it did rather well, and wish I could put more than one video up at a time to show.",

Once that was done, I was immediately able to start creating iPhone videos with the tripod properly swiveling to follow me. Has been working great for me since I started using it.",

I don't use the auto tracking feature very often at all but ive tried it a few times at home and it seems to work just find.",

                "reviewText": "As someone who regularly produces content for platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Vlogs, this smart shooting holder has significantly upped my video production game. This definitely isnt the products Ive used the are worth hundreds but does the job well enough.The 360\u00b0 rotation capability of this tripod is its standout feature. It tracks movement, keeping the subject (in this case, me) centered in the frame without any manual adjustment. This feature alone has saved me countless hours that I would have otherwise spent adjusting the camera position.What impressed me further was the no-app requirement. This tripod operates independently, freeing me from the hassle of downloading and navigating through another app. The gesture control and remote are intuitive and responsive, making it incredibly user-friendly, even for those who aren't tech-savvy.The rechargeable aspect of this tripod adds to its convenience. I've used it for extended periods without worrying about battery life, which is a significant plus for outdoor shoots or longer recording sessions.However, it's worth noting that while the auto-tracking is generally smooth, there can be occasional hiccups in extremely fast-paced movements. It's not a dealbreaker, but something to be mindful of if your content involves high-speed action.",
