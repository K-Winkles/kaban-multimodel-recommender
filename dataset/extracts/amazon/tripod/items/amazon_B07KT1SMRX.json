I wanted to take family Christmas photos in front of the tree and didn't have anyone to take them for us. I ordered this selfie stick and figured I would give it a shot. We used the tripod the whole Christmas season to take photos. The remote made taking pictures so easy because you did not have to set a timer on your phone and then run back to get in place to take the picture, you could discreetly press the button on the remote while holding my smile.",

                "reviewText": "I probably shouldn't be complaining for a price tag of $13 after coupon. The selfie stick works as expected. Bluetooth is easy to setup, connectivity is quick and stable. The tripod base is sufficiently wide to place it on a flat surface. The telescopic stick when fully extended is not sturdy at the top, the telescopic section one before the top most section rotates by about 10 degree making the phone tilt. May be my unit is defective, and hope the manufacturer reads this and offers a replacement.The remote control clicks in place, but it feels like it may fall off. Be careful to make sure it is properly put in place. Because of poor sturdiness, I have rated versatility as below average.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this selfie stick with high hopes. Being an avid traveler and someone who enjoys capturing moments, I thought this would be an ideal addition to my photography gear. But alas, this product is far from what I had envisioned.Firstly, the stick's construction is incredibly flimsy. It's an uncomfortable blend of cheap plastic and subpar metal components. The moment I took it out of the box, I knew it wouldn't last, and I was right. After only a week of light use, it began to wobble, making it impossible to capture steady photos or videos.The telescoping mechanism was another disappointment. Instead of smoothly extending, it jerked and resisted, and I felt like I was in a tug-of-war match with it. Not to mention, it would often jam halfway, leaving me with a selfie stick that was much shorter than promised.And then there's the phone holder. It's practically a phone destroyer. The clamping mechanism is overly tight and scratched the sides of my phone. Plus, it did not provide a secure hold. My phone, which isn't even a particularly large model, nearly fell out multiple times. The risk of damaging an expensive smartphone far outweighs the benefits of this shoddy product.The bluetooth remote, the supposed 'high point' of this product, was nothing more than a cruel joke. It refused to connect to my phone half of the time, and when it did, the lag between the button press and the actual photo being taken was exorbitantly long. I was left with a gallery full of poorly timed shots.Lastly, the customer service was terrible. When I contacted them about the issues I was experiencing, I was met with dismissive responses and a clear lack of understanding about their own product.Overall, I would not recommend this selfie stick to anyone. It's not just a waste of money, but also a risk to your valuable smartphone. A perfect example of 'you get what you pay for' \u2013 in this case, a heap of disappointment. It's clear that this product was designed with low costs in mind, not user experience or quality. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this disastrous selfie stick.",
