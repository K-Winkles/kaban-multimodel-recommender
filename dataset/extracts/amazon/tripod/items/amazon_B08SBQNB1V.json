                "reviewText": "I have a Sony a7 IV and I took this on a trip with me to film, I was doing a lot of vlogs and when I placed the camera down on the tripod it fell and no matter how I put the legs of the tripod it seemed like it couldn\u2019t hold the weight of my camera. At first I thought it was cause of my light I had attached but nothing was attached to the camera and it just fell, other then that I think this product is very useful and not bad to use at all, even while I was vlogging the videos would come out not shaky and my arms wouldn\u2019t get as tired as I\u2019d normally get with other tripods.",

                "reviewText": "The Joby GorillaPod, a.k.a. \"bendy tripod,\" looks retro-robot cool with its sectioned ball and socket legs. Yet, it's that ball and socket construction that is its undoing. While looking for some kind of bendy tripod, I was almost sold on the Joby until I read review after review about how it loses its strength after a while, and that makes perfect sense; anything with that number of friction fit pieces is doomed to wear out, such is the nature of friction.Enter the ULANZI MT-33 \"octopus\" tripod. It does away with the ball/socket sections in favor of high elastic rubber legs, meaning (like the Joby) it can be formed to fit around posts, branches, uneven surfaces, etc. to hold your phone or smaller DSLR or mirrorless exactly where you want.Add in the excellent ball head, side-mounted cold shoe, capability to mount a camera or phone - with another cold shoe above the phone, 1/4\" screw mount on the other side, and built-in level, and you have the most complete package for vlogging you could want. That its price is half that of a Joby makes buying the ULANZI MT-33 a no-brainer.It's built far better than one would expect for the price, and is made from quality materials. This will be part of my kit wherever I go.Well done, ULANZI! I have one of your little lights for vlogging, too. It came with a magnetic diffuser and a number of gels, along with color temperature and brightness adjustments. It's a great light and is a perfect compliment to the MT-33.When it's time to shop for more vlogging gear or bits and pieces, ULANZI will be my first (and likely, last) place to start.",
