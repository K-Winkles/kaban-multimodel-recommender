                "reviewText": "I wanted a lightweight tripod - ideally carbon fiber, but aluminum would be OK - with a removable ball head, Arca-Swiss type release plate, a handle, and capable of reaching over 6' (I'm tall).This tripod not only has all of that - it also has a detachable monopod, and allows you to mount a camera BELOW the tripod for macro photography, and it does all of that while looking really good - the orange/copper accents are pretty cool. And it's inexpensive when compared to others that have similar features.It's not a hard handle, it's a strap, but it's better than not having something to carry it by. I took one star off of the Weight rating because it's aluminum, not carbon fiber, but seriously, you won't find a carbon fiber tripod for this price.I've got four tripods, two of which are more expensive than this one by 50% or more. This is by far my favorite for versatility, features, and looks.",

It had enough weight to feel substantial without being a burden to carry.The tripod is equipped with a very nice ball-head. It is easy to adjust and is very sturdy. The panning motion of the head is extremely smooth. The quick release plate seems to be a standard arca-swiss plate.The center column is easy to adjust and obtain that extra height when you need it. It also disassembles to combine with one of the legs to create monopod. This is great to have, and you don\u2019t need to carry two pieces of equipment. The bottom of the center column is equipped with a hook for mounting extra weight, should you need the extra stability.The legs are locked into place with a metal spring-loaded lever that make folding the legs up and down very easy. The entire tripod is equipped with twist locks that are very smooth and simple to operate.",

                "reviewText": "The Joilcan tripod is very sturdy and not so lightweight that a little bit of wind could knock it down. I really like that it came with the travel bag and it has an extra height tube for low angle shooting.The camera mount is metal and not plastic which is one of the main reasons why I chose this tripod. I really like the extra angular photo shoots that I can do with this tripod along with the different degrees you can set when creating a video. The ball head has a very smooth movement and the twist knobs make it easy to function with.The only downfall is the placement of the leveler because once you place your camera on top the leveler is covered, so that makes it difficult to determine whether it's levelled or not, which makes you do some guess work, but overall I really like this tripod and would recommend it to a friend.",

                "reviewText": "This is easily the best tripod I've ever owned. The construction is so solid that I don't worry about the lifespan of the product. I love the fact that the ball head rotates in all directions, allowing landscape and portrait orientations with minimal trouble. Some have complained that the mechanism for loosening and telescoping the legs isn't convenient, but I always find the \"snap\" style ends up pinching my fingers when I'm opening and closing them, so I love this.Positives:- Sturdy workmanship. All screws and- Independent ball-head mechanism for complete flexibility- Legs fold 180 degrees, allowing the tripod to be as short as possible for travel and transport- Quick-release plate works well- Center column reversible for macro photography, if your subject is near the groundNegatives- Weight. If you're looking for carbon fiber, this isn't it. But you'll spend $300 to get that, so I'm ok with it. Might not be for a smaller or weaker person if weight is an issueUnknown- I haven't used it as a monopod, and probably won't. I haven't really explored that, and have a dedicated monopod, should I want one.I can say that I recommend this completely, and look forward to many years using it.*Update 10/28/2021*While visiting Niagra Falls, I laid the tripod (folded up) against a fence while I took some pictures nearby, and it grew legs. Well, it already had legs, but you know what I mean. I was crestfallen. When I got home, I went to Amazon thinking I might upgrade to a more expensive tripod, but when push came to shove, this guy was too good to pass up. I bought it again, and look forward to (if I can take good care of it) using it for many years to come.",
