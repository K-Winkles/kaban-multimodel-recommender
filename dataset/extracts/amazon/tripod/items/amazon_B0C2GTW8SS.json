I tried other phone holders but they were either to small to hold my S23 Ultra or they were made of cheap plastic. This Phone Tripod Mount is all Aluminum and built like a tank, yet it is small enough to put in a pocket. It adjusts very fast with the turn knob which is great. Nice quality rubber on the phone gripping edges and where your phone back will sit against. Has several places that accessories could be mounted and a Bubble level on top. You are not gonna break this thing even if your tripod crashes to the ground. Absolutely recommend this!",

A little bit on the heavy side, but also, you can throw into your bag loose and probably not worry about it breaking under an any normal circumstances.",

                "reviewText": "1. SOLID - If you're tired of \"machined plastic\" items that break, get ready to smile! This *GEM* looks, feels & works perfectly. It's made with precision, & is *ALL METAL*, aside from a knob & rubber affixed to the phone mount surface. Wait until you adjust the thumbscrew to fit your phone! You won't believe the precise feel of the mechanism's three sliding rods. It's apparent that this was designed & built by talented people who care.2. STURDY - Granted, much depends on the tripod, but if you've been stuck using spring-loaded, plastic, selfy-stick adapters previously, you'll be very pleased with the *ROCK SOLID* attachment to your tripod of this adapter.3. FEATURES ->Standard, \u00bc\" x 20 tpi mounting holes, top, bottom & two on it's back.>Cold shoe slide mount.>Rail mount.>Bubble level.4. VALUE - Can I give it a six?5. OVERALL - This little, but important, accessory is so nicely made, & such a great pleasure to use, it actually made me smile - I had to show my wife that not everything today is made like c*ap. This will be around longer than I will. I happily put it on my all-metal tripod I've owned for 55 years - Perfect for each other, (and for me).",

I would expect to pay much more to get close to this exceptional quality and apparent dedication to maximizing utility. I very very rarely write reviews but I'm inspired to when I handle this.
