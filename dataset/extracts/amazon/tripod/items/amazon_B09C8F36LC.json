                "reviewText": "I've used a few tripods in my life. I'm far from a professional, and nothing in the thousand dollar range or anything... But for under $100 this thing is pretty incredible.It FEELS sturdy. Like you can just feel that this thing is ready to work.The adjustments are easy and quick. And the arca plate is a nice change from what I've used in the past.The fact that this came with a cell phone mount too... It should have been the tripod I bought years ago.I added the Small rig fluid video head too, and I'm ready to go!",

                "reviewText": "I love this tripod. It's lightweight and easy to use. I have a lot of tripods and this one is my go-to. I do want to tell you though, that if you take it, take the allen wrench with you. Sometimes the legs and other items work their way loose. Keeping the allen wrench on hand to tighten them is important. It's not a deal breaker by any stretch but it does annoy me personally. For the price, it's a great product and comes with a lot of accessories.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the SmallRig tripod with expectations of quality and reliability, as I have owned several SmallRig products in the past. Unfortunately, this tripod has been a letdown. Despite minimal usage over the past year and a half, it has failed to meet basic standards of sturdiness and functionality.One positive aspect is its height, which I found to be ideal for my needs. However, this is overshadowed by the significant stability issues. Every time I use it, I encounter problems; it doesn\u2019t stand up properly and feels fragile. For a product that is not frequently used, I expected far better durability and performance.Based on my experience, I would advise potential buyers to consider other options. While it might look good on paper, the tripod fails to deliver in practical usage. It\u2019s disheartening to see a reputable brand like SmallRig miss the mark on such a crucial aspect of their product.In conclusion, this tripod is not a wise investment. There are better options available that offer reliable stability and build quality.",
