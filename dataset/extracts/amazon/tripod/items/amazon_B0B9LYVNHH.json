                "reviewText": "This isn\u2019t my first \u201ccheap\u201d tripod I\u2019ve bought on Amazon, so I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be anything exceptional because of the lower price. I was pleasantly surprised by how solid this tripod is for the price. The quick release mount is sturdy and solid holding both my phone\u2019s weight and my camera\u2019s weight. The remote shutter for the cellphone was a great addition, especially for the price of this tripod/shutter bundle. To hook it up to my phone (iPhone 15 Pro Max), I simply switched it on and went to my Bluetooth settings and hit the name of the device to connect it. It took me maybe a minute, tops. It\u2019s a great addition for me because I\u2019m a content creator so no more timer pictures, remote shutter works great and it\u2019s small enough to conceal in my hands in photos. I actually used it yesterday along with my new tripod to take holiday photos of my boyfriend and I and it was great. I also like that the remote shutter has a spot so you can put it on a lanyard or keychain so you don\u2019t have to worry about losing it in a pocket or bag. I will note that the tripod has a bit of weight to it compared to other cheap \u201clightweight\u201d models so if you\u2019re like me where you take it out on hikes, be prepared for it to add a bit of weight to your pack. For me it\u2019s worth the extra weight to have a solidly made tripod that\u2019s not going to break. I\u2019d absolutely recommend this tripod.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not a great photographer, but I enjoy photography, want to take good pictures and want to get better at it. I can't attest to whether or not this tripod will meet the high demands of people that know what they're doing to a greater degree than myself, but I think my observations may be helpful to folks like myself.Most of us should have noticed that yhis tripod is just over 3lbs. Like myself, I suspect that some of you will not be able to picture this. But note... this is a pretty light weight tripod. Its intended to not be a burden to folks that will tote rhis around for half a day and it's successful in this regard. The manufacturer said that this had legs of greater thickness than usual, I'm skeptical of this, but I'm reassured by the square shape of the legs which typically add strength to any hollow tube of metal.I gave full marks for \"sturdy\", it is, but only 4 stars for stable, because extended all the way, it does creep me out a bit, as any 3lb tripod would. If I keep the bottom portion of the legs unexpected, I find it stable.I consider it well made for this price point, but I'm sure that a more expensive tripod would feel more premium and robust. The metals feel good and plastics seem premium to me and those \"sponge\" parts on the top extensions are appreciated, feels less cold and now round, good feel while carrying in the hands. \"Sponge\" seems premium and doesn't seem like it will degrade quickly.The swivel of the head feels \"certain\" albeit maybe a bit stiff, but this will likely normalize over time. Design is intuitive enough for even a novice to tripods like me to discover quickly.I do find that when I put the camera on, it skews ever so slightly to clockwise, but this seems to be a by-product of its new condition, I just pinch down the \"base\" it's sitting on while I snap the shutter and it's level every time.BUT this particular tripod has a brilliant feature that few models I've seen have. That hook under the main stem is perfect for hanging a heavy camera bag, making it REALLY stable in the process. My camera bag isnt heavy, but I keep a supermarket bag with me, place 3 rocks from the surroundings inside, hang it and feel brilliant as the wind blows, it makes that much of a difference! I could have gotten a much better tripod for $80 or $120 for sure, but I didn't want to spend that and I'm satisfied with what i got.",

                "reviewText": "This tripod turned out to be better quality than I expected. None of the plastic parts feel cheaply made or fragile. It has simple conveniences like foam grips near the tops of the legs, a leveling bubble guide, and a handle that make moving and setting up the tripod easier. If you need a tripod that can elevate your camera above 6 ft this will do it. In my opinion, it was well worth the extra few dollars compared to other similarly priced, but cheaper, options.",

I am not sure if it is use for that purpose just like the screw interface using the vertical mount. It easily got loosen once it was clipped to the phone mount.Update: I messaged the seller regarding the phone mount issue and responded quickly. A replacement has been received and it fits perfectly to the very nice Tripod kit. Changed my rating from 4 to 5 stars.",

However, it is a bit light and flimsy so you need to be careful, especially if using heavier equipment. A heavy camera can also make the height adjuster slowly descend. If you're looking for a solid professional tripod, this isn't it, but those will run you hundreds of dollars. This is perfect for occasional use, and especially if you want to use it with a phone, but works well with a full camera.",
