We had minimal color options, so I chose the baby blue over the pink.After reading the reviews briefly, I did not know what to expect because I had just ordered another tripod from Amazon for around the same price point, and it was highly disappointing because the bottom part was plastic and the top part was metal. It was nowhere near the quality I thought it was going to be.So when I first got this in the mail to pick it up, I was shocked at how big the package wasn't how long it was.Tripods tend to shrink down their small footprint.So when you first get it in your hand, you have to stop and think how this thing unfolds, and that's in a good way because it's a tiny footprint that you can pretty much throw in any bag whether that's traveling or put it somewhere in the corner, but this is a great trip.I am disappointed by my lack of reading correctly, but I thought the tripod legs would be aluminum due to the product description.After figuring out how to open the tripod up, I was shocked by the build quality of the pole, which is lovely aluminum and has a solid feel.I am at McDonald's, grabbing a coffee, and this is where I first took it apart.Once I got the tripod legs down, I was surprised by how big the footprint of the tripod legs was and how long they were.I would compare this base to a lighting setup for an LED light versus a selfie with an iPhone or GoPro.Once you put the base down, it's solid.It can be uneven.Just make sure that you are on a flat surface.What you could also do, which I have done with other tripods, is you can throw like a weight down there and potentially a tiny sandbag to wait for it down a little bit more if you're using this grass or potentially on the sand somewhere.The aluminum base is strong, and it has a great build to it.Again, I've seen tripods from five dollars to $5000One of the first things I did when I opened the package up I didn't realize that this was going to be a 55-inch telescopic brush, aluminum monopod, and that was a good way.After putting it on the ground in front of me, I decided to try my iPhone on there, and then when I went back, I tried a couple of LED lights because they fit in there, depending on how big they were.I did not have a chance to use Bluetooth; however, with the phones now, if you have an Apple watch like I do, you can make a Bluetooth connection to your Apple Watch and take a picture from there, but it is an excellent option that it is a Bluetooth connection.Overall, I give us a 9.5 out of 10 regarding the quality.The only reason why I'm sharing a 9.5 is because I thought the legs were going to be aluminum.The legs were aluminum.I expect a slightly bigger price point, between 30 and $40. Again, I've had multiple tripods across my life.What are the downsides?Going to reach out to the company to see if there are any options to have not just a spring-loaded bracket for an iPhone but also the ability to plug in a 1/4 screw so you could use this potentially with a small camera, perhaps some lights and if it's lower than 55 inches this would be a great light stand that you can use or if you want to have a more miniature DSLR camera that doesn't weigh that much I think it would be a good idea too.Regarding the color, I was on the fence about getting the blue or the pink, but honestly, it doesn't matter to me. I'm so impressed by the tripod that I'm going to be using it on my next photo shoot for a temporary light stand because I'm so used to taking light stands, and this is due to the footprint.I looked at the website, and they have various price points for different types of tripods that range from $42. 99, which is almost a 70-inch selfie stickThose that come with bags which is nice.Also, some of the brackets they have for various types of phone setups. TI have a carbon bracket and a metal phone tripod mount, which looks very high-end.These brackets typically cost between $50 to $200, depending on the CNC manufacturing and looking at it. It is of excellent quality.You have a self-lock on the back &those fourth screws in a cold shoe mount, as I mentioned.If you have any questions, let me know. Still, if you're going to be traveling a lot, doing many product videos, or just doing videos of yourself speaking into a camera, maybe it's going to take you one to two minutes to set up and 1 2 minutes to break down your can't go wrong, and the colors are cute too.YOUTUBE STATEMENT ABOUT REVIEWS AND PHOTOSI'm in the process of setting up my YouTube studio to create product reviews. I plan to post a video review of this product on Amazon shortly.Once the studio is ready, I will upload those videos on YouTube and share them here.I use a Canon R3 camera with various RF lenses to capture professional product shots for my clients. My experience includes commercial photography at conferences, conventions, product shoots, podcasts, motorsports, PGA, MMA, and various events in Experiential Marketing across the USA and Canada.The purpose of creating these video reviews is to help people understand the practical use of the product and how it compares to other products.This will be beneficial for both Amazon and YouTube reviews.TM",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Getting this open was a bit of a puzzle, but if you look at both ends, you'll see one is flat, and one has three triangles. Hold the edges of the flat cap, and pull gently. You'll feel the spring, but keep pulling gently until you see the pink plastic phone grip. Pull this a bit more firmly, and you'll see the silver telescoping rod. Grasp the silver part and pull to extend. Before you get too far, pop open the three triangles on the bottom, those are the legs. Then continue to pull the rod, when you get it fully extended, the legs will open. You can then adjust the height of the stand to suit your needs. The head, where the phone goes, is spring loaded so will expand to fit many sizes of phone. I tried an iPhone SE2 and an iPhone 15, and both fit fine, and stayed in place with no slipping or sagging. The stand is stable, even with two dogs racing around it, it didn't jiggle too much, or topple over. The plastic legs are probably the weakest point on this stand. If you tripped over one, or someone backed into it and stepped on it, I suspect they would break pretty easily. That's one of only two things I don't like about this. The supplied bluetooth remote shutter button paired easily (literally took just seconds), and worked perfectly. It's rechargeable using the supplied USB-A to USB-C cable. I'm not too sure about the way it attaches to the stick, however. It snaps into and out of it's little compartment very easily. That's the second thing I'm not thrilled with; the remote does *snap* into it's little compartment, but I think without the tape holding it in place it might pop out and get lost pretty easily. On the whole, it seems well designed and sturdy, and I really like that it collapses into a small tube which can easily go in a large purse, a tote, or a suitcase. I think it's a good addition to my collection of iPhone accessories.",

                "reviewText": "For one, the pink color is very cute and stylish. It also comes with a remote which is very useful. It is also easy to connect to the phone. You just have to turn it on by holding the button and connect it your phone Bluetooth. The remote also has a compartment on the stick that it goes in. You just pop it out when you are ready to use it. I used it for Christmas to take cute holiday pics with boyfriend. I also traveled with it on vacation and it fit well in the suitcase with no issues. As a selfie stick it has great length and you can angle your phone any way you'd like to get the best photos. I also like that this stick doubles up as a tripod for your phone if you are looking to make different videos or create content. If you are an influencer, content creator, or just someone looking for a selfie stick, this is a great choice. The only thing is that I tried to place an external selfie light on the stick/tripod and the weight was causing the tripod to not be as stable and it eventually fell off. SO if you do plan to use a light to add to it, make sure it isn't too heavy in weight.",

                "reviewText": "In the world of photography, versatility is key, and this tripod/selfie stick hybrid stands out as a game-changer. Measuring just over 12 inches when collapsed, it's the epitome of portability, easily fitting into a bag for on-the-go use. Fully extended, it reaches an impressive height of 135cm (53 inches) as a selfie stick and 137cm as a tripod, catering to a wide range of photography needs.Constructed from sturdy aluminum, this device demonstrates exceptional durability, confidently supporting an iPhone 14 Pro without any signs of flexing. The plastic components, including the phone holder and tripod legs, are surprisingly robust, offering a stable base with no wobble during use.A standout feature is the Bluetooth camera shutter activator, which pairs seamlessly with smartphones, ensuring reliable connection for effortless shooting. The stick's carbon fiber effect finish adds a touch of elegance, enhancing its overall aesthetic appeal.However, this product isn't without its quirks. The unique extension mechanism may initially confuse users, and its considerable weight might deter those seeking ultra-lightweight options. Despite these minor drawbacks, the tripod's solid construction and reliable Bluetooth connectivity make it a valuable tool for photographers and content creators alike.Its limitations in landscape mode and the slightly restrictive height may not suit all users, but for those prioritizing portrait photography and stability, this tripod/selfie stick offers a compelling combination of functionality and design. Whether you're capturing selfies, group shots, or engaging content, this multifunctional device is well worth considering.",

Urlaubs-Hintergrund.Da aus Aluminium gefertigt ist es zum Einen sehr leicht und zum Anderen trotzdem nicht so zerbrechlich wie ein Plastikstativ oder Plastik-Selfiestick.Der eigentliche Clou ist das Dreibein-Stativ, das sich am Fu\u00df des Selfie.Sticks befindet.Damit hat man ein sehr stabiles wackelfreies Smartphone-Stativ.Ich habe an Silvester das Stativ aufgebaut, das Smartphone in die Haltebacken geklemmt, dann die Neigungsverstellung der Halterung so eingestellt, dass das Smartphone auf den Horizont und den Nachthimmel ausgerichtet war und hab dann die Smartphone Kamera bequem in 2 Meter Entfernung auf den Gartensessel sitzend mit der integrierten und herausnehmbaren Bluetooth-Kamera gestartet und 20 Minuten Silvester-Feuerwerk aufgenommen und dabei mit den G\u00e4sten angesto\u00dfen.Klasse Sache.Dann habe ich es einfach gedreht - man kann es um 360 Grad drehen - und uns noch eine halbe Stunde beim Bechern gefilmt.In die neigungsverstellbare Halterung kann man jedes g\u00e4ngige Smartphone und Iphone bombenfest einspannen.Der Atumtek Selfiestick und Stativ ist hervorragend verarbeitet, leicht und vielseitig einsetzbar.Wir k\u00f6nnen es nur w\u00e4rmstens empfehlen.",

                "reviewText": "I really enjoy using this selfie stick and phone tripod. My Samsung A50 sits in it well and snug. The clamp can be swivelled into a vertical orientation with the selfie extending pole will be off to the side. The clamp can be adjusted into different angles (tilting it forward or downward).The plastic casing is of decent quality. Probably not for heavy duty use. But for a daily selfie stick/ tripod. Although it does get quite cold in the winter.. not as cold if it was all metal though.The remote charges quite quickly and can be used multiple times. It's easy to turn on and to find and connect on bluetooth. I do wish it was a bit more secure then just little slide on clips, as the remote has fallen a few times when using. Although it hasn't fallen out when in my bag.The telescopic pole is easy to slide out and it stays at the extension (no sliding down from the weight of the phone). The tripod legs are also sturdy and balance the pole well. There are some rubber grips on the feet of the tripod legs for a simple grip. I used the tripod function while doing a timelapse video in a very busy place and it held well.For a dual purpose selfie stick/ phone tripod I do wish it had a few extra features like a wristlet loop or even just a hole to attach your own wristlet strap. It would make it soo much easier to carry around. And perhaps a screw top hole to screw on an external led light. Not that it's required but it would be helpful.Overall I'm quite happy using it and usually have it packed in my purse or backpack (if it's big enough to put it in).",
