                "reviewText": "I read the reviews on this light and was excited to try it out after reading pretty good reviews for the price. The piece that holds the phone is not sturdy and does a poor job of holding upright without flopping down or to the side. After the first use, the light will not turn on. It only does a quick flash (like a camera flash) and turns off, even after being plugged in and attempting to charge it. I was not successful in getting the light to work again since. The lock on the tripod is also not very sturdy and allows the extension rod to slide down while using, despite fastening as tightly as I could get it. I found it to be incredibly frustrating to use, and due to the light not working anymore, I will not be able to use this item at all.I guess it was a shot in the dark given the price, but I would recommend getting something of better quality, if you are on the fence. I see this item as waste of money. I would personally invest in a light without a cord next time also, as the cord was pretty short and it was a pain to find a plug close enough to reach my workspace without extension cords, as well as trying to maneuver around it while filming.",
