                "reviewText": "I have the older model of this tripod, which has been discontinued. Since 2018, I have subjected it to way more use and abuse than it was designed for. I had to replace the bolts which were worn thin last year, which the hardware is easy to find at a local hardware store. In 2022, right before a trip to Montana the inner leg brace on my tripod broke. Customer service handled my claim quickly and sent me a replacement part which arrived just in time. Despite buying my tripod four years prior, they gave me the part free of charge and paid for the shipping. Couldn't be happier.The only cons to this tripod system that I have found, is that if not leveled perfectly the system can be somewhat shaky in windy conditions. By this I mean, you can notice some swaying in the video but its no where to the point where the tripod could tip over. The other issue I have found is that under lots of use, the bolts can loosen and need to be tightened regularly. Luckily if a piece of hardware does fall off, its a standard size and replacements can be found at any hardware store.",

I get many complaints on the quality of the video that I shoot, and none of it would be possible without the sturdiness and smooth operation of this tripod for video purposes. I even used it for recording a night rocket launch. Outside the it is so sturdy, that the wind does not move it at all, rock solid.Recently when cleaning it, the pin on one of the foot pads broke off.

                "reviewText": "I like the robust, stout frame of this tripod. It is really stable and it has ability to anchor with either steel pointed tips or plastic foot pads. It is mostly made of aluminum, although the connections from one part to another are either bakelite or plastic. I also very much liked their customer service. I was able to e-mail Regetek and ask numerous questions before I bought this tripod. The product is rated for use between -20 Celsius to +70 Celsius.Do not recommend it being used below 40 degrees Fahrenheit, because some of the plastic connections become brittle when colder. I understand this is a new product, and Regetek customer service was most gracious in providing answers to my questions.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this tripod for creating YouTube videos but ended up using it for my (other hobby) indoor studio portraits as well. The tripod arrived in a timely manner via Amazon. It was professionally packaged to prevent damage. The tripod is heavy and comes with a cover bag which is nice for photoshoots on-location. It can handle my DSLR, Zoom lens, Mic, Panel lights and Ronin S. I've been using it for a couple of months now before leaving a review. It's reliable, sturdy and well-made. The tripod is easily adjustable. I would highly recommend it for professional videographers. Overall, I love this tripod and would highly recommend it. I would definitely buy it again.",

This tripod can be placed in the professional category.Solid and come fully assembled in its travel bag.Make no mistake it's a heavy tripod, so if you are backpacking it will weigh you down. But for me who plan to do a lot of long exposure photography as a hobby this is perfect for my planned road trip journeys.If I have to travel lite I have a small lite tripod for that.Completely blown away by this tripod. Just to add, i received exactly what was advertised. I saw a comment from one buyer who said they received a different design, thankfully not in my case.Totally recommend it \ud83d\udc4c",
