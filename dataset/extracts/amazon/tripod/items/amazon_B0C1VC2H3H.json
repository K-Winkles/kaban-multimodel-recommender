                "reviewText": "I liked everything about this selfie stick except one thing which I already knew when I bought it. I do wish it was a little taller. But other than that it\u2019s a very good selfie stick and works exactly as it should the four legs on the tripod make it very sturdy and steady And the lights work perfectly",

No more trying to prop my phone on odds and ends to get a good picture of me with my family! No more self-timer! I'm super excited to keep using this product.",

Everything was great except that the wand when extended didn\u2019t have much stability. My iPhone is an 11 MaxPro. It\u2019s a bit heavy. The extended wand didn\u2019t hold it well. It kept rotating either to the left or to the right. And it was hard to control. Maybe it would be great for a smaller phone.",

When I travel for work without my partner and my dog, I like to video call them every night and have dinner together over video chat. We both use these during our video calls and I get to see my partner and my dog during dinner and before bed whenever I'm away from home! Great quality product. I love the light it comes with too so I don't really have to worry about the hotel room lighting being too low.",
