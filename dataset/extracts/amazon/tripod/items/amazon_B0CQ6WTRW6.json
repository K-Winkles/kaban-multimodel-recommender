                "reviewText": "This tripod is portable and offers good versatility on desks, on counters, and on other platforms and surfaces.It is very practical and easy to use!The compact size allows you to hold it comfortably with one hand while using your device, and the legs are both extendable and adjustable enough for varying heights as displayed in the pictures.It has overall a very easy to use position shifting.The mounting plate is smooth to remove, and it has a surprisingly useful bubble-balance level check ( in the green cap on the knob). The swivel-ball is fit in place and can be angled all around the base, or adjusted to a 45 degree angle. The ball-pan lock knob and base are also very comfortable to use.In addition, the tripod is very stable.Each leg is reinforced by a robust rubber cap surrounding each foot. The legs can be extended securely (see max. height in pictures) , with each leg having its own angle adjustment lock.They also allow for an easy grip when fully closed together, making it easy to carry around.The center column (in the middle of the tripod's legs) is also adjustable for varying heights with its own lock knob, and it can be removed to further lower the tripod.I never expected how useful a smaller tripod would be until recently.This is incredibly helpful, portable, and easy to use. Highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I like to travel, and now that Covid vaccinations look like opening the world up again, I'm always on the lookout for well made photographic products that are light, easy to pack, and get the job done. This tripod is well made, and extremely versatile, fitting the needs of those who need a tripod for their phone, compact camera, or even in the right circumstances, a DSLR or full frame camera with a standard, or light zoom attached. It comes well packaged, and is made of carefully milled aluminum and quality plastics. It has a ball head, is fully adjustable, and weighs in at about a pound and a half. It extends to a total height of more than 20 inches. It's sturdy enough for light use. You wouldn't use long telephoto lenses on it, even though it's rated for 15 pounds, but I'd have no problem attaching a DSLR with a kit lens, and for what it's designed to do, it works very well. It comes with an attachment to use a phone, and it holds my Pixel 3A securely. Great for Zoom, or for stable video shots. As you can see from the pictures, the central element is removable for use as a hand held vlogging tool. Great small tripod. Glad I bought it.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This small desktop tripod is surprisingly sturdy. It has more weight to it then you would think. It easily holds a S21 Ultra phone in the landscape or portrait orientation. It comes with the cell phone holder. It also can easily hold a GoPro camera. I had no concerns about its stability with these items. I also tried by Canon T5i DSLR on it. I had a big lens and it started to tip forward so watch for that but it had no problem with the weight. A DSLR with a small lens would work. I think the description said it would hold 15 pounds which the best I can tell is true. The legs extend out to give it some more height but it folds down pretty small for ease to carry. It even comes with a little carry bag. It has a standard tripod attachment on a ball head. The ball head held everything in place once tightened down but you still get the wide variety of angles. The ends of the legs have rubber tips so it won't mess up a wood desk/table. Overall, definitely worth he money.",

I took it out for some night photography and it's small size was just so much more convenient for carrying especially since I didn't really need to have a full size tripod with me. It's very stable and held up my Sony A7 just as well as it held up my phone. I have the full size tripod with ball head as well and I didn't think I'd use it as much as I do but it's really nifty and I use it quite a bit. I didn't really like the absence of a bubble level to let me know when I'm level when I have the ball joint straight up. There is a bubble level on the dial that is nice, but can only be used when the ball joint is sideways. Also the holder for the phone could've been better if they used a holder that clicks into place because I had to fumble with getting the holder open and getting my phone in there. Otherwise, this is an excellent product that will serve as far more a desktop tripod.",

The tripod has the same fluid and sturdy ballhead joint and comes with an arca style quick-mount plate. The three legs easily extend from 9 to 17 inches. Notice the overall size is comparable to a 20 oz water bottle - this is an easily packable and portable tripod. Best for use indoors for close up work when the full sized 81-inch tripod would be ridiculously over sized. This tripod also includes a cell phone mount, but it would be overkill for just a cellphone camera. It is perfect for a full size camera when a tabletop is all you need. Wonderful product.",

Da war ich anfangs skeptisch\u2026aber es funktioniert tipptoppEinzig, dass am Kugelkopf nur eine Schraube f\u00fcr Drehung und Neigung vorhanden ist, k\u00f6nnte man bem\u00e4ngeln. Ein sauberes Panorama ist so nicht m\u00f6glich. Und die Libelle ist wohl auch zu rein dekorativen Zwecken vorhanden.Der Rest ist f\u00fcr diesen Preis richtig gut, stabil und wertig. Es ist so schnell zur Hand und einfach zu bedienen, dass ich indoor mittlerweile die teuren, gro\u00dfen Stative meist weder nutze noch brauche.Und f\u00fcr den Rucksack ist es genial und ben\u00f6tigt nicht mal eine Stativhalterung. Im Lieferumfang ist eine Arca Platte und eine Handyhalterung inbegriffen. Und das f\u00fcr unter 50\u20ac.Klare Empfehlung \u2705",

                "reviewText": "This looks and feels sturdy. Well built, and works well in a range of operation. You have to turn the legs to enable the extension, and turn the other way to lock it. My concern is that doing the turning and clicking many times over something will give way, so time will tell.Some thought has gone it so that the various parts work well together as a whole and not cause friction or such, e.g. there is a bit of foam on the legs to prevent the middle pole cutting into it. Again, over time, this might wear out. The screw to clamp or unclamp the camera holder is a far better idea than a twist and clip found in other tripods.The middle pole being made in two parts is ingenious, that you can reassemble it \"upside down\" which enables the camera to be clamped much lower down. I don't quite like the middle knob that controls the height of the middle pole and the tilt, but I can see this makes some sense that doing two tasks in one is probably a good thing, and also it saves another knob, which saves space.Its weight is not too light nor heavy; too light it will topple easily, too heavy, well it defeats purpose of being small. It comes with a holder for smartphone, as many tripods do. Overall, very impressed with it.",
