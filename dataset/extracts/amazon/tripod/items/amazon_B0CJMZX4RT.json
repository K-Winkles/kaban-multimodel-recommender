                "reviewText": "I don't really need a portable \"tripod\" for taking pictures, since I don't really use my phone for pictures at all. What I did need was a portable stand to be able to have my phone sit up on my desk so I can see notifications. I mostly work from home these days, and on the rare occasions I go into the office I don't have a stand for my phone. My office has switched over entirely to a \"hotelling\" situation, so I can't just leave a stand at the office and expect it to still be there the next time I went in. To further complicate matters, when I do go in I have a half-mile or so walk to my building from where I park, and I'm already carrying my laptop, my bag, and my lunch, so I wanted a stand to be as minimal in weight as possible. This really fit that bill, seeing as though it's about the weight of two of my credit cards, or possibly even lighter since my Visa is one of the metal-core ones that weighs more.It has a satisfying \"click\" when you fold it out, and it's a very sturdy little base when it's set up.One complaint I would have is that I have an iPhone 11, and even though they provide a good number of customizable slots for different-width phones, none of them fit the 11 perfectly. Very odd to me, seeing as though it was a top-selling phone when I bought it roughly 4 years ago. I'm guessing whenever I do bother to upgrade, whatever I buy will probably have a slot that fits (unless it's exactly the same thickness as an iPhone 11). It still works fine, it's just a little more wobbly than I expected.The other complaint I have is the price. It was $35, which is pretty pricy for a thin piece of plastic and a half dozen adjustment slots (none of which fit perfectly). I'm not going to return it, since it fills a need that I do have, but I am going to move it down a notch to 4 stars to reflect that I'm not really sure it's worth the money.",

The plastic construction means it won't attach to my Magbak case, which is how I intended to carry it. The included assortment of adaptors are a really nice touch, and the packaging is nice.Works well, but overpriced for a piece of plastic.",

It has the thickness and size of maybe 2 or 3 credit cards and fits inside a minimalist wallet (Aviator).The only thing is that it feels fragile. It is made of plastic (mainly) and carbon fiber. I wish it were more sturdy, with a different material.Be careful and read the instructions and watch the videos on YouTube teaching how to assemble properly.",
