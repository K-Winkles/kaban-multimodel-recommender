All the rest of this cool stuff was a bonus. I can't imagine how all this can sell so cheaply. Get it while you can, I say.",

It works great. The legs are super flexible and work for many different surfaces and applications. The phone clip is a bit on the lightweight side and I did replace it with my more expensive, machined (fancy) phone clip that I use with my full size tripod. I wish it came with a case to slip it into. That is my only complaint. If they had an additional purchase, pouch or case, I would purchase it in a flash. This is a keeper. One note: Check the weight. It's fine for me but it is a bit on the heavy side. Good for me, so I can mount a camera on it if I want to. Might not be what you are looking for though.",

Other than that I like the ease of setting setting it up and adjusting the angle and rotation. Fits and holds my iPhone 15 very well. It is pretty stable on flat surface collapsed or extended. However on a windy day or uneven surface it could easily fall over as would be expected. For my use it's perfect. I especially like the compact size when collapsed. Great for traveling.",
