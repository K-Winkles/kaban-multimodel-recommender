The telescoping mechanism is firm and strong and won\u2019t collapse. The bluetooth button is easy to manage and stays in place with a magnet. It seems a bit weak though, so I fear it might slip out if something bumps it.Best of all is the customer service (through Amazon.) my bluetooth button stopped working so I submitted a replacement and they sent one right out, and trusted me to return the old one (which I did, of course) with their pre-paid shipping label.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this 40-inch Extendable Selfie Stick Tripod to use with my iPhone and I am extremely impressed with its functionality and versatility. I was tired of having to ask strangers to take pictures for me and my wife, and this selfie stick tripod has been quite a rescue. The extendable pole allows for a wide range of shooting angles, making it perfect for capturing group shots, couple photos, panoramic views, and even action shots.The tripod is also very stable, ensuring that my shots come out clear and shake-free. I have used it on a number of different kinds of surface including grass, sand and carpet. It does stay stable. Recently, I was on a beach in Florida with my wife, and this tripod came in really handy for taking our pictures without having to ask the strangers all the time. It was also very useful to take time lapse video of the beautiful sunset. If you do not extend it all the way, the tripod can stay highly stable even if the surface is a little uneven. The wireless remote shutter is really helpful, making it easy to take photos without having to fumble with my phone's camera controls. The battery on the remote lasts for a long time. I have only charged it once so far for my 3 trips to Florida.I noticed two main issues with this tripod though. The first issue is that the phone holder is not retractable, which makes it really inconvenient to always rotate the knob for attaching the camera. Having said that, I think having to rotate the knob to hold the phone makes the phone more secure in the tripod than if it were retractable. Another issue is, like others have suggested, that you cannot really switch between the front and back cameras with the remote. It would have been really great if that functionality was available.Overall, I highly recommend this Selfie Stick Tripod to anyone looking for a versatile and high-quality tripod that's compatible with iPhone.",

                "reviewText": "WOW! What an accessory for your phone this is! It's remarkable how good photographs and video are when you put your phone on a selfie stick but wow this stick goes above and beyond! Push in at the bottom and legs flip out and it's a stable tripod that you can even adjust to eye level! I have noticed it's a bit of a quandry to deploy these legs, it's not easy to deploy them, in fact rather difficult, but once you do, it's awesome! Instead of the thin flexible portable radio antenna like sections, this has nice thick and stout pipes that extend out to the length you desire. The REALLY NICE things about this stick are: It has a BLIETOOTH REMOTE shutter release that is attached magnetically and comes off so you can stand at a distance and completely control the camera, including start/stop doing video! THIS IS WAY COOL! It doesn't have a spring clamp on the camera holder but you can screw it down tight and it's not popping out ever. It handles up to a 7\" tablet, so a big screened phone in a thick protective case fits right in! If you're a photographer like me and find your phone does some things your DSLR doesn't or does poorly, YOU GOTTA HAVE THIS!!! Oh and the phone mount assembly can come off and be screwed into a standard photograpic tripod as well...how cool is that? A must have guys & gals!",

The remote control is pretty nice and has a smart design. It just inputs the volume up on your phone through Bluetooth which takes a picture/video on apple. Overall for the price it's pretty good but not the best.",

I chose this stick because of the tripod option built into the bottom of the selfie stick that works well and was stable while using. Remote was easy to pair to my iPhone and worked well. Thin aluminum stick but it is painted black and looks good. Overall great value and I am happy with it.",

The difference are tripod, quality much better than Chinese one. That is all",
