                "reviewText": "I have a iPhone 13 mini with a thin case on it and it works for my phone. It holds your phone tightly and it doesn\u2019t fall or slip at all! It\u2019s a little on the heavy side but it\u2019s very sturdy. The remote it comes with does feel very cheap like it could break if it was pressed too hard so be careful of that. It doesn\u2019t come with instructions on how to put it together either and as someone who\u2019s never had a tripod or anything it was something I had wished was included in the package. However it\u2019s pretty simple to figure out once you start messing around with the tripod. Overall I am loving this tripod and will be recommending it to anyone that is wanting one!",

When I hit contact manufacture I was directed to a site of a business with the same name that had a clear warning at the top of the page stating they are not the company on Amazon and their name and contact information were being used without permission. Ended up with no resolution and had to return",
