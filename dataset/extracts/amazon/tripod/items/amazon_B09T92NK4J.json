                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I was watching a YouTube video and someone said to buy this and I said \"OK!\"Glad I did as it's a great addition to my Osmo Pocket 3 set up. I have a \"high end\" tripod that I've been using but it just looks ridiculous to carry that around with the Osmo.Before I get to pros and cons: This tripod is deceiving in terms of its size. So much in fact that when I received it I thought it was missing a piece. In my brain there was no way it was going to extend to 5 feet given how compact it is when closed. I was wrong. It's great.Pros:-Very compact. Can fit in a bag easily-Extends up to 59\"-Sturdy for items like and iPhone or DJI Osmo Pocket-Price, you can't beat it.-Easy to set up, close and adjustCons:-Makes for a clunky selfie stick. In a pinch it can work but the handle size and weight are not what I'm used to in a selfie stick. Not that it's heavy but selfie sticks usually have thinner handles and weight next to nothing.-Opening the base isn't as smooth as I would like for it to be. It's not hard it's just not a seamless as the rest of the functions.Overall this is well worth the money and gives me the ability to trust that my device won't fall over all while ditching my massive tripod that makes me looks ridiculous when I carry it out in public.",

                "reviewText": "This is my favorite tripod stand. It is versatile, switching from being able to hold a mobile phone then over to holding a point and shoot camera that you can screw in. And all without having to take off and replace any parts. The downside from every other rig and selfie stick and tripod is that there are just too many parts. So many get lost and then having to replace simple pieces becomes a hassle. This allows you to just have a simple all in one pocket tripod. ***SOMETHING TO NOTE: this tripod does not come with a wireless Bluetooth remote control/shutter button attached. You will have to use self timer or have a blue tooth shutter button if you plan on taking far away selfies or what have you.***I have so many blue tooth remotes so the absence of one with this tripod is okay with me.Another small favorite thing about this tripod is that it has a ball joint. Others will have latches or things that click and turn. The ball joint allows you to get angles without too much movement or displacement of where you had the tripod standing initially. It\u2019s easy to useThis pocket tripod is worth buying. If you have a heavy camera/DSLR or video cam. It may not be able to hold the weight of how expensive your equipment was. It will slowly sink. This is for casual use with a phone and or point and shoot or a webcam.If you want a steel sturdy tripod. Look for one that meets the weight requirements of your gear combined.I will probably get myself another one",

                "reviewText": "I have had a few tripods now and this is by far the best for day to day and portable. It can fit in most of my medium sized purses, any tote back, slips into the side pockets of backpacks, can be handheld on the go and no one even noticed or questions, but then it pulls out to above eye level. Extremely sturdy for how long it extends. Holds my phone snug without fail and holds my canon g7x mark ii when there is no wind. Quick to adjust to get right for that perfect shot. I guess you can also use it as a selfie stick. Love the white + pink too. Great quality, versatile, impressive design, effortlessly convenient",

                "reviewText": "Love this little extension pod! I bought two of them for small LED lights where mounting the lights on regular light stands would be difficult or cumbersome due to space considerations. They're exactly as described online, but the one weakness I've found are the plastic legs. I suspected them to be plastic based on the video. I can confirm they are plastic and may not hold up to reckless usage so if you do buy these just keep in mind that in order to help them last just don't overload or stress them and they'll be fine. They hold up great for small LEDs and very light cameras, phones or action cams. They nicely double as a selfie stick and the built in 1/4\" and phone holder is brilliant by design. I will keep both of them and would by again if I more.",
