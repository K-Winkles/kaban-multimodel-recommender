Its ability to be filly tilted back or forwards 90\u00b0.With all that maneuverability its use is almost endless for cell phone vidoeography and vlogging.It can also be used for directly downward shots and video.One observation and his isn't a dislike, is that with its lightweight plastic construction you will notice vibrations since it doesnt have the sturdiness of a metal cell phone holder.",

Though I am being picky since I feel like it\u2019s gonna hold my expensive ass phone so it got to be. Also the way it hold the phone is weird. It\u2019s not like spring it just u push it down and the lock it. So it\u2019s a bit scuffed I think. But at the end of the day it works so.",
