                "reviewText": "At first it seemed sturdy to use and record with. However, as I tried to use it to record a video, it kept on falling down midway of me recording. I didn't know if it was because of my phone's weight; so, I took off my phone case to adjust the balance problem. However, it still kept on knocking over. At the end, I managed to adjust the problem by placing it somewhere else and surrounding it with random objects, trying not to knock the entire thing down. Anyhow, this product did do it's job; although we had some complications.",

It does tend to fall forward once in a while from the weight of the phone but it\u2019s still fine to see. Also the price is right!!",
