                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I wanted a face tracker for Facetime and Zoom calls, and I have to admit I was skeptical - but wow this thing actually works.First, I will note it's very sturdy - it sits firmly on the desk while it moves my iPhone moves around. Basically, the camera within the unit is what it uses to ensure that your face is constantly in the middle of the picture.The magnet is *VERY* STRONG - my iPhone 15 Pro was very, very secure on it, even with the case. The unit itself charges via USB-C and seems to have great battery life.Attached a video, where you can see me moving left and right and it tracking, but for privacy reasons I've shifted to the rear camera. You'll get the point though - it works! Color me impressed.",
