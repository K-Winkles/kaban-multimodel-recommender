                "reviewText": "This product has been so helpful for me as a Photographer: it is lightweight, easy to carry, and very sturdy. The tripod was delivered in a neat packaging and also comes with a bonus bag! This makes it easy to carry it outside, and it can also be reduced to a small size for storing it. The clamps can be used to increase the size of the tripod for shooting cityscapes or a scenery. The head of the tripod can revolve 360 degrees, which makes it awesome for shooting different angles! Even more, the tripod can be used for a DSLR and a phone camera, and it even comes with a bluetooth connected remote that can be used to take photos even when you're away from the camera.All in all, this tripod is an absolutely amazing product for a photographer or videographer! A must buy indeed!",

                "reviewText": "Such a cool fun phone tripod! First of all, the packaging is great so no need to worry that something will get damaged in the way. You also get a bag to store it.Second, and more importantly, this is lightweight so you can easily move it around.The tripod can be opened or closed so it's also great if you want to store it out of the bag or use it in a narrow space since it's very sturdy and won't budge if you place it on an ottoman.I love doing video chats with it! I use it instead of holding the phone all the time or of course, do selfies using the remote Bluetooth clicker.Tip- If you want to use your phone vertically, and your phone is larger than the capacity of the holder, just tilt the hand knob and you're good to go. Also using the remote is very easy, turn your Bluetooth on your phone and connect, and don't forget to turn the remote \"on\", that's it. There isn't much to assemble, just the phone holder and a few minutes to get to learn the different hand knobs. I highly recommend trying it.",
