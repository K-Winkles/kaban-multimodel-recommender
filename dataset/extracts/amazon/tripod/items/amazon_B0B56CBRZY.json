It comes with attachments and in a small sinch bag so it\u2019s perfect for travel. Absolutely great quality and it has spots for everything like a swivel stick and a phone holder. I don\u2019t use the phone for photography but if I did I could because they included it.Works amazing easy and simple the only small complaint I have it that moving the camera up and down is a bit confusing and hard and the camera doesn\u2019t really fit tight on the tripod. It fits for sure just not at tight as I\u2019d like but other than that it\u2019s perfect",

                "reviewText": "Needed a sturdy tripod for 20x80 binoculars and this worked well. Ended up really liking it\u2019s design and features. It\u2019s easy to set up and take down and maneuver around with side handle. The four leg flip locks offer good height options and the extra height using the crank is perfect. The rubber feet help make it more sturdy and there\u2019s a tiny leveling tool attached to the side which is handy. The release plate works well, it comes with a extra one, and the lock knobs are easy to use for horz/vert rotation tilts. The extra option that is handy is the hook to be able to weigh it down. It also came with a cell phone attachment and travel bag. So overall good quality purchase for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I have used other more expensive and more metal component (heavier) tripods similar to this one. I had gotten out of my hobby for awhile and have just gotten back into it, so I thought I would try this tripod.First off, for those that have never used a panhead on a tripod, the knobs and levers do certain things.I have seen reviews where people have complained that the \"elastic knob\" doesn't hold the camera up, it will droop. It's not supposed to. That's not the \"tightening screw/lever\" for up and down, it's for panning side to side. You will want to pan at different tensions to control the speed of panning without jerkiness, hence the \"elastic knob\". Also, you might want to set the tripod legs at a certain position that may not be a good direction for the lens. This is where you can loosen the elastic knob, turn the panhead side to side to aim your camera where you want to, then tighten it down to hold it from moving side to side. The legs stay where they were, on uneven ground where you might have uneven leg extensions so that the tripod is level for panning this is very helpful to not have to move the whole tripod itself and just move the panhead on top.The long thin handle that comes uninstalled screws into the panhead and is what controls the up and down of the camera/lens, that will tighten more than enough to hold any dSLR and lens combo without drooping. The handle is long and thin so you have something to grab and position the up/down of the camera/lens and then just twist to tighten to hold your position. Very useful design.I advise people that have never used a panhead on a tripod to do a quick google search to know exactly how they work, I'm sure you will be pleased with this tripod after having learned how to use it properly.The tripod itself. Lightweight, good. Height, good. Sturdiness, ok. But, it does have a hook under the panhead that you can hang your camera bag or anything else on, and that WILL add a bunch of stability to it. So, definitely not a drawback.Maybe a bit too much plastic (lightweight), so be careful over tightening things, not necessary to do that, either. Also, I wouldn't advise being too rough with it. That doesn't mean it's not a good tripod, I think it is. But, it is a lightweight one with a bit more plastic than a high end professional one would have, and it is at a very attractive price point. So be aware that plastic breaks easier than metal (duh, right?).The quick release plates are a nice add-on, I have used them before. They make it easy to remove the camera for various reasons while using the tripod, but I don't leave them on the camera when I am not using the tripod, I take them off. You'll understand why after using it a few times.All in all, after having used high end tripods with panheads in the past and this one now, I think it is a very good tripod at this price point, hard to beat. I do like the compact and lightweight aspect of it. I have only just received it, so if anything changes with repeated use I will update this review.EDIT: I should mention, as to the stability, I never extend the smallest, bottom legs on any tripod, regardless of how heavy duty it is unless I have to, which I almost never need to do. I'll extend the post the panhead sits on before I extend those bottom legs.The reason for this becomes obvious once you put regular use on a tripod with any height to it. It is the biggest contributor to instability on any tripod, keep 'em closed up unless you absolutely need to use them, then just be aware of how much more unstable those legs are going to make the tripod, any tripod.",

Anyways, it's light enough to fit and strap to my hunting pack and the pan is smooth. It did it's job and we were able to spot some white tail and javelina from over 1600 yards. Solid.For those wondering if it will fit INSIDE your hunting bag, probably not. I strapped mine to the outside and had no issues. The height adjustability was perfect for where I was on the mountain. I really did put it to good use. Would definitely recommend.",

It is so easy to level, easy to use, compact, lightweight and comes with an extra quick release base so I don't have to switch them out on my cameras. This one even came with a cell phone holder! So, when I'm not using it, my guests are! I would highly recommend this tripod to anyone. If you do have a favorite, this makes an exceptional back-up!",

Turns out I was right. This tripod is great for the super basic stuff and is fairly lightweight for traveling which is nice, however unfortunately it is largely plastic and even with everything as tight as can be, it is not sturdy enough to any kind of timelapse or long exposure photography without getting image shifts and out-of-focus shots due to small vibrations or movement, especially if there's any kind of breeze out.Overall a decent tripod for the average user for holding their phones for social media content and general stuff like that, but not worth getting if you are looking for something stable for professional work IMO.",

Rotating the camera using the arm will cause the entire upper assembly to come loose, so you really need to tighten that down. Unfortunately there is no easy way to do that. The Pan head lock works well enough, just don't expect to use this as a movie making tripod unless you have super power dexterity. For stills, it works great. The price is great for what you get, and I wanted something I could drag around out in the bush, and muck. The addition of a bag is nice, and it's pretty light.",
