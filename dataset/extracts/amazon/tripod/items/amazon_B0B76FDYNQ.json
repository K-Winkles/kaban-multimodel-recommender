                "reviewText": "I use this stand in two ways. The first way is to hold my tablet while I play exercise videos. I'm able to clearly see how the exercises are demonstrated at a comfortable height. It also allows me to keep the news on while I'm exercising.Legs are easy to collapse and it comes with a handy bag for storage.I also use the remote feature that comes with the fob. It easily integrates with my tablet over wi-fi. We use the stand and the remote to take pictures during Christmas and my son's wedding reception. It was great to be able to set it up and then be in the picture and click the remote.This is a great tool.",
