                "reviewText": "While the tripod's maximum height, partial plastic assembly, and lack of a crank or space for a cold shoe light betray its humble goals as a budget-level product, this is actually a pretty solid and reliable little tripod. It's portable enough to stash in a larger backpack or the trunk of a small car. It's strong enough to support a modern mirrorless camera with a reasonably moderately heavy lens attached to it. (If you still use a dedicated palmcorder, it will work fine with it as well). It does not have a smooth swivel head intended for cinematography, but no budget tripod does and its ridiculous to complain about it. Yes, it will be a little shaky if you extend it to its full height - but all tripods tend to.This is a fine tripod for home use with a desktop home studio. It is fine as a smaller, lighter tripod for travel photos. It works well for taking self-portraits or for keeping a camera steady for long exposures. I've used it every day since I bought it and I expect to be using this for a while, unless it happens to get run over by a truck.If you're a pro, you'll want to pursue other options. For an enthusiastic amateur like me, it's just what I wanted to replace an older mini tripod I got as a gift years ago.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this is a gap filler but ended up loving it. It holds a D300s and D700 with D lenses no problems. No good for macro tho as its light enough the shutter kick shakes it but for anything else it's an excellent value.It's very compact when folded, the bag is nice and has a shoulder strap. Aesthetically pleasing, the color and design are nice I think. Three section legs, pretty short at first and not as tall as most would like but acceptable. The quick release isn't the best but it doesn't suck. It's small and I've already managed to break the alignment peg off but once the camera is locked in you're good. Orientation is odd with the shape of it but it works all the same.Adjustments are easy and confident, it uses threaded collars to squeeze and bite down on the axis which usually I dont like because they slip and strip, and this may after a year or so but for now when I tighten down these heavy heavy cameras and lenses it holds like a champ at all angles. Havent tried vertical yet but have had it on a roof pitch among other things and it stood strong.One big thing to know, the spread of the legs, the base area is not big, meaning high center of gravity. It is basic yet very nice for the money, surprisingly nice. It is sturdy, I carry mine every day on the side of my bag. But dont buy this and expect it to be a work horse. It is light, it is tubing, it will bend and break if you abuse it.This is an excellent value for anyone needing a stand to start out or more stands to setup their shoot properly. For the price and convenience I'll end up getting a few so I can spread out lights, mic's, and cameras using multi point adapters. 3 of these is better than one good one in my opinion. Remote flashes, video lights, reflectors, little things that add up and pile up are where this guy shines. For 16 bucks its worth a shot right? At least until you can get that carbon fiber, collapsible, tripod/monopod with the fluid head for over 100!",

                "reviewText": "The Amazon Basics 50-inch Lightweight Camera Mount Tripod Stand with Bag is a budget-friendly and portable solution that offers convenience for amateur photographers and hobbyists. While it excels in affordability and ease of transport, it comes with some considerations, especially regarding stability when used with heavier camera equipment. That being said, it's proven to be good quality as it has lasted me 4+ years with no damage. I especially recommend this tripod to be used with phones, not so much for professional cameras but more on that in a little bit.Affordability and Portability:The standout feature of this tripod is its affordability, making it an attractive choice for those on a budget. The lightweight design adds to its appeal, providing portability that makes it easy to carry around for on-the-go photography sessions. The inclusion of a carry bag further enhances its convenience during transportation. Furthermore, this tripod is very compact making it easy to put in backpacks if you choose not to use the carrying back like I did.Height Range and Flexibility:The tripod's ability to expand to a height of 50 inches offers a decent range for various shooting scenarios. This flexibility is advantageous for capturing different perspectives and compositions, making it suitable for a variety of photography styles.Lightweight Nature and Stability Concerns:While the lightweight nature of the tripod is advantageous for portability, it introduces some stability concerns. The tripod, at times, can be a bit unstable, especially when extended to its maximum height. This makes it less suitable for use with heavier camera equipment, as it may wobble or tip over. Due to its lightweight construction and potential stability issues, it's essential to exercise caution when considering this tripod for use with expensive or heavier camera setups. For those with high-end equipment, investing in a more robust tripod may be a better choice to ensure the safety of your equipment.",

I try to keep my pack as light as possible and I have tested in the field and it works fine. My pochade is only 1.5 lbs and the tripod information stated it will bear the weight of 4.5 pounds. It's very lightweight but that is what I needed.",

Never used it for a camera so can't say anything about that but it's great to record with a phone. Simply buy a phone mount (which I have also reviewed on my profile) and it's good to go! This tripod is unbeatable for the price. The build quality is not that great. However, it's still sturdy. Once it fell off my hands and one of it's legs broke. I was disheartened and thought it's done. To my surprise, it's still fine and strong. I just had to fix it with a wire and that's it. You can definitely buy it. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
