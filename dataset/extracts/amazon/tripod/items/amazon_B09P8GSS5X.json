For sure the pictures don't show how big and good this piece is, I've studied a bit the listing before ordering, but this one is just something else!So this is a really big and long one, I got the 160cm version and it's one of the biggest I've ever had to try.It's folding pretty well, vreu compact comparing to how it looks unexpanded. The handle is thick and quite big, not very comfortable for a girl's small hand, instead with a bit of strength while using, this one can produce really good pictures or video.The Tri leg stand is big and pretty stable for those 160cm it is while in a vertical position. Because of the strong base it god that big and thick handle which is actually dividing into 3 parts.The stick itself is strong and may bend a bit if with a phone on the other end and held from the handle, fully expanded.The phone holder is big and good with the inside area padded with some foam to hold the phone better. The holder can be removed and instead a 1/4in socket to mount any kind of camera there.I am really impressed, had a big fun using it from drone-like videos as it's really long.For sure I do recommend it, it's a very good piece for a fair price.",

                "reviewText": "The first thing that caught my attention was the length - at 160cm, it's much longer than any other selfie stick I've used before. The 160cm length is perfect for getting groups of people in the frame and the extra length comes in handy when using the integrated tripod stand. It can film me seated when placed on the floor and also works when I am standing at full height. The stick is very comfortable to hold in normal use and the Bluetooth remote control that clips into the handle of the unit is a great addition. It pairs easily with my phone via Bluetooth and makes taking pictures and videos a breeze. The button can be removed and used as a remote control when I am using the tripod mode, or I can leave it attached to the handle for selfies. It's cleverly designed and very user-friendly.The unit comes with a universal phone holder, making it compatible with most smartphones, including my iPhone 13 Pro Max, which is held very securely in place\uff0c and the ability to rotate it into landscape or portrait mode is a nice touch. the handle has a matte texture which increases friction and prevents slipping, making it easy to hold onto. However, the handle of the stick may be too thick for some people, especially women. Additionally, when using it outdoors, the length of the stick can cause it to sway in the wind, slightly reducing stability.With a discount coupon, the actual price of 24.99\uff0c That's a pretty reasonable price for this product",
