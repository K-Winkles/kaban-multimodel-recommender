                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars The perfect travel tripod, surprisingly well built.",
                "reviewText": "For background, I do videography and still photography with a Lumix GH5, Canon T3i, DJI Phantom 4 Pro and DJI Osmo+. I own a set of Slik Pro 700DX tripod legs which are huge, but create an incredibly stable platform for just about anything. I also have a Zomei Z888C Carbon Fiber tripod which I consider my \"standard\" tripod. It's light and compact enough to bring along most places, but very stable and a max height of 68\". I bring it when I'm doing a planned shoot. However, it's still big enough that I tend to leave it behind in many situations when I'm traveling light.So for me, this Bonfoto B690A fills the role of a travel tripod, and a \"just in case\" tripod. If I'm grabbing a small set of gear to throw in a gear pack for a casual shoot or impromptu event, and I don't really think I'll need a tripod, this is small enough that I can bring it along \"just in case\". Considerably smaller and lighter than my other tripods, but is still substantial enough, and stable enough, to be useful in many situations. It also takes up a lot less room in a suitcase for traveling or backpacking.I'm actually quite surprised at how stable it is for such a small and inexpensive piece of gear. Even when both the legs and center column are fully extended, it's very usable. Of course it isn't as stable as the others I own, but plenty enough to do the job especially given that if I didn't have this tripod, I wouldn't bring one along at all for some situations.I like the flip-lock legs, although the locks are plastic and I'm concerned that they may not hold up long term. There are a few other small places where plastic is used instead of metal, such as in the quick release plate, but that's all good because it helps reduce the weight, which is one of the reasons I got this. I weighed it at 2 pounds 7 ounces, a real lightweight to me!Everything works smoothly and has the feel of a quality tripod. In fact, many of its features look identical to the Zomei tripod I own, and I'd guess that they're both manufactured by the same company. The red accents make for an attractive, modern look. The ball head seems well made and works fine. You can loosen a small knob on the side which releases the head to rotate in the pan axis, without unlocking the ball. This makes it more useful for videography and still panoramas. The rotation of the pan axis has a very smooth feel to it, but also has a resistance to motion that gives it a kind of viscous feel. It rotates with low to moderate force when moved slowly, but requires more force to rotate more quickly. This imparts a steadiness to video panning, and pretty much eliminates the uneven pan speed you usually get from hand panning on cheap tripods. By the way, this feature is also on my Zomei tripod ball head, which looks very similar to this one.Bottom line, this tripod will get a lot of use from me. It's the perfect size and weight to allow me to bring it on shoots where I might otherwise decide to just leave the tripod at home. And at $65, it's cheap enough that I don't have to worry much about mishandling it or having it get damaged in transit. Definitely an excellent travel tripod. I highly recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "This is a terrific tripod, very easy to set up, lightweight, sturdy and stable. The fit and finish make the tripod look like it costs a lot more than it did. This tripod is a tremendous value. The inclusion of the carrying case is another excellent feature as well as the easy to use ball head with protective cover. The size of the tripod when folded is about 14 inches and when placed in its case is easy to carry over the shoulder. I have loved using it for the brief period that I have had it. Anyone looking for a quality, extremely affordable, well-made and compact tripod should definitely take a look at the Bonfoto 690A lightweight aluminum alloy tripod with a 360 degree ball head, 1/4 inch quick release plate, bubble level and carry bag. You will be very happy you did. I am using mine with a Canon SL2 lightweight, compact DSLR. I works perfectly when attached. A nice, unexpected feature is that when my camera is attached to the mounting plate, I still have access to my battery and sd card compartment located on the bottom of the camera. I am able to take both out and put them back without having to remove the plate. This is very useful and saves time. Bravo! Bonfoto.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Durable, reliable, and great features for the price. Only one complaint...",
                "reviewText": "I never feel compelled to write reviews, but this little tripod deserves it.I just needed something lightweight, but durable enough to withstand travel and some hiking in to remote areas for time-lapse photography and the occasional video with a FujiFilm XT2 and various lenses.I was really surprised at the quality of the build and the attention to detail on things like the felt bag cover for the head and quality carrying tote. The tripod is well made with durable materials. The aluminum legs have a nice coat and finish and the Delrin (or whatever the plastic is) on the leg latches are solid. Even in the dark, I have had no problem handling the various parts. There is one foam pad on an upper leg which seems like durable/quality material that will last. I like that they only chose one leg for the pad, rather than the standard two pads on most tripods. Again, in the dark shooting astrophotography, it's nice to use the single pad as a directional reference. The pointed, rubber feet work well, although it would've been a nice touch to make them removable to reveal spikes underneath to mount on the ground in rough terrain/uneven surfaces. It is a great feature to be able to unscrew the ball head from the base so I can connect things like a small slider or equatorial tracking mount. It's thoughtful of the manufacturer that they included a worm screw for the ball head attachment that is a standard 3/8 thread (or could be 5/8, not sure) with one end stepping down to a standard 1/4-20 thread. I can reverse that screw and have the option of attaching most any accessory to the platform base while having the ball head available to use elsewhere. The ball head action is very smooth and locks in place nicely. All of the knobs and action of the swivel feature are very fluid and lock down well. The adjustment on the neck/center post is done by twisting the metal+rubberized collars to extend and contract the height, and these collars have a very nice, fluid action to them. This works well in conjunction with the red aluminum latches that click the legs in to place at various angles to obtain maximum/minimum height of the unit. It was another nice touch to add the spring hook to the end of the center post so that you can hang a sandbag or weight for added stability. I have a 5lbs. and 10lbs. bag. I was a little worried with the 10 that I was overdoing it, but it worked fine. The 5 has been the go to and it works for added stability.The red accents and branding are classic and add a nice polish to the system, especially if you need to have gear on the job that needs to present well to your client.My only complaint is the camera plate and female receiver portion. They decided to make that entire camera platform out of a hard Delrin/resin/plastic, instead of continuing the metal from the base housing, knobs, and ball head. It is much more solid/harder/durable than the latch plastic, but I don't think they should've skimped out here. It would have been a nicer touch to maintain the solid metal throughout the camera platform. Not sure why that decision was made. I would've gladly paid a bit more if it was a cost thing. It's not a deal breaker, by any means, but I'll just have to be aware of it when loading/unloading gear from a vehicle/location and when setting up/tearing down. I don't see this happening, but would hate for the plastic to crack or break by striking something hard or being crushed by a case, especially at the female receiver side. This is a drop-in/side loading plate, which is nice and should save from any shaving of the plastic had it been a slide-in type of mount. There is an Allen screw that sits flush inside the top of the female receiver side and attaches the platform to the ball head. I'm assuming you can remove this and replace the entire camera platform with one of your choosing, but I haven't tried this yet. Lastly on this complaint, there is a spherical spirit level at the top of the camera platform, right next to where the camera plate loads. It's basically useless as your camera will cover it as soon as it's loaded and a level above the ball head is useless as you will be adjusting the ball head for the frame anyway and if necessary using the camera level. I would've liked to have seen the level at the base below the ball head so I could level the legs from the ground.All in all, this is a great product for the price and one I'm sure I'll get plenty of years of use and enjoyment out of. With a few modifications, it will be a trusted companion on a lot of shoots.Purchase with confidence!",

There's a handy hand strap that I don't think was mentioned in the listing.The head it came with seems fairly well built too, but I swapped my Manfrotto ball head over to it... it's a no brainer...it's a Manfrotto head. My old one which is still a great tripod will now be my secondary/backup tripod, or for lights, studio setting, etc. I bought this because my old one is too long and clumbsy to fit on the camera backpack, I need to keep things as light as possible. The black and red looks pretty nice too.One answer I never got answered is the spikes do retract by turning the rubber, it wasn't a deal-breaker it they weren't.Also I was surprised the bag seems pretty good quality, it's padded, seams seem sturdy. The only downside is it is only big enough when the tripod is invert flipped to its shortest possible length, but I may not even need it when it's on my camera backpack.",
