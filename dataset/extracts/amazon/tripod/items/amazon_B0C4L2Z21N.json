                "reviewText": "So my old 20 year tripod failed on Christmas, so I bougt this. Tripod technology hasn't changed much since then, but there are two things that set this apart from other tripods. Frist off, the tripod can extend much taller than any of the other tripods I have seen. This is useful for shots that you want to be higher than and look downward. This also helps clear crowds at graduation and what not. The other great thing about this tripod is that it came with an attachment for a phone. This is great in itsself since most of the time the phone works as good as or better than a typical camera. This tripod is solid and overall would recommend to anyone looking to updgrade from an older tripod or need additional height.Forgot to mention that this tripod also came with extra rubber feet which is nice since they tend to fall off over the years. It also came with its own carrying case.",

                "reviewText": "The stand is light yet sturdy. It can go upto approx 4.5 - 4.8 feet and still be stable, and it is easy to adjust and operate the stand. I cam keep my Ipad and Iphone at any angle and orientation and it can take the weight easily. My friend tried to use the camera which is 1/2 kg and it still was pretty stable. make sure to not use it on a slopy surface though.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking to purchase a tripod that would work with both my phone and Sony camera and when I found this one, it was great for my needs. The tripod has a nice smooth finish and looks really nice in my opinion. It comes with a nice carrying bag as well as a remote to control a phone that you connect to it to take pictures or videos, which is handy when you're in a park or a gathering. This is my first ever tripod that I bought, before I would use my phone or camera freely which would be a burden at times if I wanted to take pics with myself and the whole family. The tripod seems sturdy enough for me and my use cases, for example I took it with me to a picnic on the lake with my family and had it set up on sand and I did not feel like it would have a problem staying upright. In my opinion the price of the whole kit is great and inexpensive.",

                "reviewText": "It has exceeded all my expectations and proved to be an essential tool for my leveler, telescope, and camera needs. Its construction provides the stability required for my telescope. I used it for my leveler and its a game changer when hanging pictures. I also use it for my telescope and does it make a difference. I can literally put the telescope anywhere for the optimal view! Despite its sturdy construction, this tripod remains surprisingly portable. The collapsible design and lightweight materials make it convenient to carry along. It fits in my backpack, allowing me to take it anywhere. Kudos to the manufacturers for creating a product that can handle all my tripod needs. My mom even uses the phone attachment for those family photos",
