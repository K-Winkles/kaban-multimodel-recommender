I weighed it and it was 4.17. Having said that the height, functionality, engineering, and controls were awesome. For a tall photographer that doesn\u2019t have to move a bunch in my opinion this is the tripod for you. If you\u2019re a hunter who\u2019d rather have strength over weight then this too is for you. For being an aluminum tripod it actually it quite lite. I elected to get the 64\u201d version to save a pound or so because I liked it that much.",

Unfortunately, I didn't do any dry runs before heading out to WY, so I didn't realize it needed some maintenance. The tripod besides being old was pretty inexpensive when I bought it, and this led to some of its adjustments being difficult to make fine changes to.So, with the 2024 eclipse being 10 weeks away, I bought a new tripod. Knowing I'd probably only use it 2-3x per year, I didn't want to spend too much but I wanted something better than my old one.I am really happy with this unit. I've done several sessions of shooting the sun to work out exposures and ISO in preparation for April and the ease and smoothness of making fine adjustments as the sun moved across the sky was apparent in the first few minutes. I am particularly happy with the ball and socket for the camera platform. So in April, this tripod will hold my camera and the old one will hold my 8x56 Skymaster binos.",

                "reviewText": "Let me first state that this tripod in hand is heavier than I had expected or hoped, but this is entirely my fault for not paying attention to the item description and reading the unit's weight. While it does weigh more than my other older one, it is as a result more sturdy. More important for me is the functionality I get. Positioning the tripod, extending the legs, and working with the ballhead gives me zero problems. While I do not necessarily need it, I do like the fact it came with a bag as well. Turning this into a mono-pod was easier than I expected. Ultimately I am more than satisfied. The quality of the tripod & ballhead are enough to really make me question why people spend $$$ on certain brand (other than the ego of owning said brand). For amateur to semi-pro this unit will be more than enough. Glad I purchased.",

The K&F ball head on the other hand is not usable for me.Any component like this is only as good as the weakest link, and in this case it is the attachment plate that screws to your camera body. In my case, when I tighten that screw completely in where it can turn no further (for the threads on both my Nikon Z5 and FTZ adapter), the plate is still loose. Basically the unthreaded portion of the screw is too long. So now the only way I can ever make it work is to engineer a solution; either by grinding the screw down a bit (though there aren't a lot of extra threads) or by fashioning a friction gasket between the plate and camera body. I'm leaning toward the latter because the rubberized \"K&F\" symbol on the plate looks woefully inadequate to begin with. Whoever designed this should be embarrassed. Whoever approved mass production and sale should be fired.",
