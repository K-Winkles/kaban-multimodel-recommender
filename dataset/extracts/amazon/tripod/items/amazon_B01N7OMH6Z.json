                "reviewText": "In my opinion, the biggest thing here is the screw that attaches to your camera is made of metal. Before this tripod, I bought two others which both had a plastic screw that was made of a shiny chromed plastic that looks like metal in pictures. Needless to say I was more than a bit annoyed at those purchases. Those plastic screws were flimsy and prone to breaking(one did break but I returned the other before it got a chance) This metal screw on a sturdy base however, doesn't appear to be going anywhere.The base itself feels solid and the connecting joints, all tight. I'm not planning on using anything heavier than a GoPro but I could easily see this tripod supporting the weight of a much larger DSLR camera. On that note, as many other reviews have pointed out, there is a metal cap on the default screw that converts this into a DSLR compatible tripod. Though personally, were I to use a DSLR camera, I'd probably buy something a bit bigger.Back to the GoPro, if you're looking for a little extra height, I find that screwing my GoPole into this tripod does the trick and holds the camera up higher. It will be a little less stable so you'll need to spread the legs out a bit but the female lanyard attachment point is a perfect fit for the male screw that would normally hold the camera.I did purchase the extra swivel mount but after messing around with it a bit, it feels quite unnecessary. These legs bend and fold enough to give you most angles.Overall, I rate this tripod a good buy. My only complaint is that the color scheme I got is black and grey. I would have preferred black and white like what is shown in the pictures but I'm not going to make a fuss over something like that.",

I haven't tried wrapping the tripod legs around something to see how strong that is, but for pointing the camera at different angles and locking the head down, it held. I like these style of legs for certain things, but w/o a head they're not near as useful, which is why I ended up going with this one.",
