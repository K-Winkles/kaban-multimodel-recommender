                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this tripod phone mount and I'm extremely impressed with its quality and functionality. It securely accommodates my iPhone 14 Max, thanks to its robust spring grips. The design includes two cold shoe mounts - ideal for attaching a flash or mic - and a pair of 1/4\"-20 screw mounts on the back, useful for wireless mic receivers or similar accessories. This versatile mount fits any tripod with a standard 1/4\"-20 thread screw attachment. Concerns about the inability to lock the vertical-horizontal rotation are misplaced; the functionality is there, suggesting that those experiencing issues may have defective units or a misunderstanding of the instructions. Additionally, some users have mentioned difficulties in rotating the mount to a vertical position when the phone is centered. The solution is simple: just offset the phone in the clamp.Overall, this mount is a remarkable blend of durability, thoughtful design, and lightweight construction. Don't let a few negative reviews deter you; this product is truly top-notch and exceeds expectations.",

                "reviewText": "Great quality. Metal and durable. Good for cameras however I used with Ulanzi MT 34 and the phone holder did not screw into tripod securely. The trios does come with its own phone holder built into MT 34- good quality but for me prefer the function of this phone holder as u can twist and rotate with having to unscrew and tighten every time u want to take a selfie MT 34. Need phone adjustments quickly and this phone holder is perfect but does not tighten securely (my opinion) into MT34Both high quality good fit for XLR and GoPro but not when I used the ST 22 or 27it comes with a built in phone holder but I want to use one with more options of 360\u2019 and boots for microphoneVery lightweight and comfortable compared to the round plastic sticks. Great if I had a camera but not for my hiking",

                "reviewText": "Bought this smartphone tripod mount to replace a cheap plastic part that broke on my ring light. This is extremely well made of aluminum and finely machined. A bit heavy but OK on my ring light. The only issue is a WAY too strong phone mount. The spring to hold the phone cannot be opened without 2 hands - exerting a lot of pressure. I have an iPhone Max which is pretty wide and it is a challenge to mount the phone. Works great and easy to adjust when phone is mounted. Recommended!",

The black knurled ring on the back locks the swivel into position.The springs in the clamp section are strong, but not overbearing and there is a lock mechanism (red dial in the pictures) that you can use to lock the clamp in position to prevent it from being bumped open and dropping the phone.The threads for the tripod screw (3 sets on this mount) are well-machined and thread on easily.There are 3 cold-shoe mounts as well on various parts of the mount. Machining is very clean on these as well.Well-made rubber grips in the jaws of the clamp help grip and protect the phone.Overall, one of the best accessories I've purchased. Definitely 5 stars.",
