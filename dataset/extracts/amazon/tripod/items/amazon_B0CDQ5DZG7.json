As a passionate photographer, I\u2019ve always been fascinated by making videos and capturing photos. Simple to put together, it can be used as an overhead view scope by simply tilting it 90 degrees or as an unreflective spotting scope. This tripod is sturdy, can be carried around easily, has a standard height, is easy to operate, and captures all the close-ups. When not in use, it is simple to store in a closet due to its small size. The remote button is superb for taking distant photos. I heartily recommend this fantastic purchase to anyone in need of a dependable and reasonably priced tripod, as it's uncommon to find such quality at this price range.",

Others had it for a week or two and the legs just started dropping off or the plastic parts disintegrated in their hands. Now if all of THAT is going on, then YES - THAT'S A MAJOR PROBLEM!! I might suggest MAKING SURE that you're not accidentally buying other people's \"Used crap for a discount\" - I only buy things like this NEW - never used. I DID buy something used before by accident - a water pitcher! OMG... imagine opening your water pitcher and the lid is cracked and somebody else's water is dripping from the filter LOL.. \ud83d\ude02 Yeah! What YOU just said - is what I said!So on this tripod - I had ZERO PROBLEMS with it (so far) falling apart out of the box. I've actually been impressed so far with all of it's many features & how versatile it is. People said the \"plastic locks broke after a week or 2\" - I just got this yesterday, but I can see where that could happen. The plastic DOES feel like something might snap or pop off if I was REALLY using this thing and readjusting it on a daily basis.It's CLEARLY not designed for that. Please keep in mind - IT ONLY COST $35, but it has all the features of the big PROFESSIONAL stands... so OF COURSE there's SOMETHING that got it's corners cut. Now out of curiosity, I scoured around on Amazon to look at the higher-end tripods and guess what.... ALL OF THEM WERE GETTING SHREDDED IN REVIEWS - ALL OF THEM are said to fall apart, or to be made with cheap plastic parts - even the ones costing over $140!! They ALL got 3 or 4 out of 5 stars... all the 1 & 2 star reviews said those tripods fell apart on sight.So I decided to take it a step further and went to the BIG BOYS SHOP - (B&H PHOTO)!! Guess what... The $100 - $200 tripods all had the SAME reviews and were said to have the SAME problems. BUT.... They DID have some $300 - $400 tripods that got RAVE REVIEWS, and that price range is the ONLY place I saw them. So I'd say, if you need a tripod that you can stand-up and break-down QUICKLY while you're filming RARE GOLDEN RAMS IN THE ALPS, or maybe you're doing a FILM SHOOT for National Geographic in the Sahara and need a tripod for your $10,000 video camera, that you can breakdown - throw in the back of the jeep and take off!! Yeah, you're gonna wanna go hit up that $400+ B&H gear. ((((THIS TRIPOD IS NOT FOR PROFESSIONAL OR HEAVY USERS!!! ))))It lists a 15lb. weight limit, but I wouldn't put 15lbs on it with the legs fully extended. MAYBE with them fully retracted and the tripod is just sitting on a table - and the camera doesn't need to be tilted. It would probably be able to handle even 20lbs in that situation. I detected no wobble and the mounting-head is rock solid as far as I can tell. But again - I'm not putting any real weight on it. My little cameras/phones are the size of my hand, and that's EXACTLY what it was designed for.Overall... this tripod is for people like ME!!\u2728\ud83e\udd17\u2728 It's for people who want to set it up - maybe for their Youtube recordings - and really don't need to mess with it after it's in place. If that's all you're using it for, it should last for a very long time - maybe decades!! But I'm SURE some plastic would easily break if you tried to readjust it after sitting still for over 10 years! lol... It even comes with a remote control that allows you to make your phone record vis bluetooth - or stop recording just by pressing the button. (I haven't tried it yet, but hopefully it works). I actually bought a separate remote because I didn't know it came WITH one - but it does!I DID knock off a star because I DO feel that if I had to start readjusting it repeatedly - that something would snap off. But I just need something to hold my camera FOR NOW; I'll get one of the big boys from B&H maybe next year - if I feel I just NEED it. But for right now, this is PERFECT - a MUST HAVE for $35 if you're doing ANY kind of camera work. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d",
