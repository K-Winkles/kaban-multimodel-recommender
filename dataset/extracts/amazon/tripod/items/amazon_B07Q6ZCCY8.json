The material is mostly aluminum which makes it light but strong. It comes with a bag of options that let you use it with your GoPro and smart phone. I now use it as a selfie-stick with a remote trigger for the camera.It is not strong enough to hold a full size DSLR on full extension but it will support it in mono-pod setting and when you do not extend it beyond a meter.For the price this is unbeatable.",

                "reviewText": "Well, well, well. Look who's here, a monopod without any directions. How am I supposed to know what to do with this stick? It's not like it's a rocket science project or anything, but come on, a little guidance wouldn't hurt, right?And don't even get me started on how to extend this bad boy. It's like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube. You twist one way, then another way, and before you know it, you've twisted yourself into a pretzel. I mean, I'm no contortionist, but this is ridiculous.But hey, once you figure out the secret code to extending it, it's pretty sturdy. You could probably use it to fend off a pack of wild animals or even a zombie apocalypse. And now that I've cracked the code, I can finally enjoy using it without feeling like a clueless fool.In conclusion, if you're looking for a monopod that will make you feel like a secret agent trying to defuse a bomb, this is the one for you. It's sturdy, reliable, and will definitely make you work for it. 10/10 would recommend (once you figure out how to use it).",

                "reviewText": "This is a clever product with multiple uses and an inexpensive (yet surprisingly good quality) addition to your camera equipment. Two concerns:First, note that it's shorter than a conventional monopod, which is typically 72\"-80\" in length; ie can hold the camera at eye level when standing. It's advertised (both online and in the packaging) as being 55\" -- however, this is only when fully extended AND with a couple of attachment added (mini-tripod legs and ball mount). It wouldn't really matter because it still wouldn't be at standing eye level unless you're a child or an extra from \"The Wizard of Oz,\" but it's still useful if seated and if you're taking a group picture. It wouldn't work if you're working a sporting event (ie the sidelines of a football game and constantly moving.Second, it can hold most consumer-grade cameras, but I'd be cautious using equipment that was too heavy. The stand should be able to support a reasonable weight, but it's not built to be as sturdy as a tripod. It's the type of stand you could take to your kid's Christmas play so you could record while sitting down without needing the floor space of a tripod. It doesn't replace (nor does it purport to replace) an actual tripod.One other slight concern is that the base unit extends with some difficulty, and I'm not sure how long the materials will hold up, especially since those moving parts appear to be plastic. However, the price likely reflects this. If it's not overused and if the equipment isn't too heavy, it should be fine for a number of years.",

                "reviewText": "A number of parts that can't be combined in different configs to give you a tripod or a monopod for your cellphone, GpPro or DSLR. I've used it with my GoPro, test fitted my phone and currently have my Canon T7i mounted on the short tripod. Very light weight, everything fits in a nice bag and fits easily in my camera bag. The only thing I would be careful with is putting the DLSR on the full pole length. I did it but it's not very sturdy for that size camera. It works nicely with the short version. The tripod converts to a handheld pole for shooting youtube videos with any camera. Very satisfied with the purchaser and surprised at all the extra stuff like a adjustable ball head and a footer for when you want to make it a monopod.",

                "reviewText": "Things I like: It's tall. It can be used as a mono-pod with a nice rubber foot. It can hold a phone, GoPro, or a small DSLR. It's lightweight. Comes with a nice bag. The tripod base is FANTASTIC. It's compact design makes it perfect to place anywhere I need it. I can use it easily for a three camera setup and move around my room to wherever I need to be working. Extremely versatile. Feels sturdy. Feels rugged.Things I hate: The ball joint you attach the monopod to cannot be tightened sufficiently to use at an angle when under load...Even an iPhone is too heavy for more than a 10 degree angle. Otherwise it just sags. The tripod also does not have a wide enough footprint to hold anything at an angle unless you've got it lashed to something. Monopod's expansion mechanism is too tight....So difficult to pull to length that I fear I'm going to break it each time. Same with collapsing it...It's just so snug that I know it'll be worthless after just a few uses......unless it naturally loosens up after a few weeks of use.It's seriously an evenly mixed bag of good vs. bad. The good is SO GOOD I don't want to return it, but the bad is just bad enough that I feel like I should. I'm still going to use it, of course. It's a nice design with some kinda serious flaws....but I'll find a workaround.",

It even handles uneven terrain fairly well.I've found myself using my cameras a lot more after getting this since I have a stable platform to shoot from.It also takes a ton less floor space than a regular tripod.My biggest criticism is that the last 2 segments(smallest) are basically unusable in any but the most ideal conditions. They are flimsy and wobble a lot.I'd definitely buy this again if anything ever happened to it.",
