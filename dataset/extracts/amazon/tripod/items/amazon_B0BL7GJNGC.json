Firstly, the light is perfect and has three different color options. The light will enhance your video quality tremendously. It is not heavy duty so, I would not recommend using it outdoors on a windy day but if there is no wind, you will love this product. The product is simple to use and easy to set up. BEFORE PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT: You should know that it comes with a USB plug, but it does not have a wall piece. With that being said, make sure you have an extra wall piece with a USB connection so that you can use this light without interruption. GREAT PRODUCT. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE.",

Its perfect for day and night filming. It's great for both cameras and phones. Extention cord probably needed but Definitely worth it.",

Once I opened it I discovered that it not only was the complete wrong size ring light but was also missing ALL of the other peices it was supposed to include. So that was dissappointing.",
