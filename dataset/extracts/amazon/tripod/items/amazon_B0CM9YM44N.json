                "reviewText": "This fits my huge samsung s22 ultra WITH hardshell case AND pop fit holder with ease! I can get a lot of great angles for filming craft work at my desk for my socials. The multiple light options help a lot to make up for the poor lighting in my living room. The stand on the floor is not as sturdy as I would like, but I have a different tripod for that. It IS better than that octopus one I tried. My only suggestion for improvement to this unit is that it would be great if the angled head extended a little further so the legs don't show in the shot and to provide a wider filming space. I like that they designed a holding space on one of the legs for the remote, but the legs can be tricky to open from the bottom. You can have to pry them apart to extend.",

This is a no for me. I\u2019m debating on whether I\u2019m even going to keep it.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this because during family gatherings over the holidays, it got ridiculous with stacking books and clipping phones to sheet pans with clothes pins, etc. trying to get just the right set up for group photos before something would topple over and we'd all have to start all over again. We didn't really need a selfie stick, we needed a tripod. This is exactly what was needed. Also I have a lot of meetings by video and I can never get the lighting right on my laptop so it's nice being able to avoid the struggle and use this tripod with the surround lighting. My only criticism is that it is a bit wobbly on carpet. I found that by adding some weight on the legs, it's more stable. Recommended",
