The bendable legs allow the tripod to be put into pretty much any position, so we can make sure the projector doesn\u2019t tip over. It\u2019s compact, durable, and lightweight. Overall, very pleased with this little guy.",

                "reviewText": "Needed a mini flexible tripod for mounting on things at odd angles as well as tabletop use. This is it! The flexible arms aren't difficult to bend, yet they stay in the place. I also specifically wanted something that would grip a cell phone securely and didn't depend on a little mini screw--too easy to lose. There's rubber on both mini-prongs of the mount for a cell phone. The spring based mount works to securely grip both iPhone X and 12 ProMax. The mini level built into the base of the mount is a great bonus.Phone mount is a little tricky to open the first time. The flap doesn't just flip open like the pictures suggest. The trick is to pull the edge towards you horizontally to clear the slot THEN extend the flap and flip to open it. Everything else is pretty intuitive to operate.The screw and wheel for mounting a DSLR camera fell right out upon opening the phone mount. A little spot of glue fixed that in a jiffy. Other than that, you get a good feel from handling the tripod, high quality and well made.Just bought another one since my folks want to use it as a stand for video conferencing. This is exactly what I was looking for.",
