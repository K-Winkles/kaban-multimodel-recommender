                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had this tripod for a couple of weeks and I\u2019ve now used it on more than a few occasions, including Thanksgiving. The tripod is very compact and lightweight. It folds up to a pretty small size and you can carry it with you. It only stands at a little over a foot tall when expanded. I found it best to put it on a raised surface (i.e., table, chair, countertop, etc.) in order to get a good straight-on picture.The tripod comes with a threaded end for a professional or semi-professional camera such as a Canon or Nikon would work well for this stand. Additionally, the tripod comes with a phone cradle (soft foam padding and plastic outside). This works well to hold most smartphones, by the way.The tripod has a swivel that can turn 365 degrees. This works decently for setting the camera up in a centralized location and then adjusting the swivel to line up the picture. I\u2019ve used it using this method a couple of times and it really works well. I put my tripod in a small case I have and it goes with us when we\u2019re on family outings. Overall I\u2019d say this tripod is simple, but durable and easy to carry and use. I highly recommend this tripod.",

She doesn't need high-end equipment, just equipment that does the job so she can maximize profit. The attachments etc., give her the choice of using a camera or using her phone.

                "reviewText": "For being inexpensive and working the way it's supposed to, I give this little tripod three stars. Not more stars because it's all plastic, it's in four pieces (and you have to break it down to make it small enough to carry easily), and there are no instructions at all. I've dealt with tripods for decades, so I readily figured it out, but I suspect many phone users will be baffled. It's OK if you think you'll want something only temporarily, such as on an upcoming vacation, but long-term there are much more convenient (and more costly) alternatives, some of which are also selfie sticks and many of which are better built.",

                "reviewText": "So everything mentioned was included: * tripod * extension piece * mobile phone connectorThe pieces as they were shipped were partially assembled, but wrongly so I wasn't able to use it at first.I thought I had maybe received the wrong item.I ended up having to look at the picture, which is what made me realize that it had been pre-assembled wrongly and that's why it couldn't stand up on it's own.Once I fixed that, it mostly worked.The tripod extension is pretty flimsy, it doesn't want to stay in place unless you sort of turn it and latch it at the top. However this does not feel secure, could easily imagine this part ceasing to work someday soon. Also it seems very flimsy and a heavy enough object might prevent the extendable piece from staying extended. This I think makes it inappropriate for professional use (or if you're going to use it a lot and need the stand, probably i'd recommend something else)With the tripod extension it's about 1.5 feet. Without it the tripod is about a foot.To the manufacturer: please either pack each piece individually (rather than wrongly attaching pieces to save space) OR include a little piece of paper showing how to assemble it.",

It doesn't have bells and whistles, it has a function. The ball joint is as flashy as it gets. When folded up, this tripod can fit in to your back pocket.The spring loaded phone holder works great. You don't have to worry about knocking it out of the holder or the wind dislodging it. The grip on this holder is crazy tight. Use this tripod on a table , car hood, etc as its' 3 legs keep it stable and upright. This is a down an dirty functional item and everyone who shoots iphoneography should have one in their bag of accessories.",
