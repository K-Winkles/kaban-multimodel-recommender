                "reviewText": "This MagSafe mount is delivered quickly and work great with my tripod. I bought this mount to make it easier when using my tripod to take pictures. I hate the struggle when using a phone holder and want a faster way to attach my phone to my tripod. This mount is the perfect solution. Now I can just put my iphone on the mount, take pictures and then just grab it and go. The magnet is pretty strong (my phone has a Magsafe case on) and I can move my phone to any direction I like, which makes taking pictures a lot easier. I need to reach out to customer service and they get back to me very quickly. Very happy with their customer service. Will recommend to everyone who wants to replace their annoying regular phone holder to this convenient mount.",

                "reviewText": "Used on a very recent trip in conjunction with a tripod extension and clamp. It was the perfect setup for family photos on a recent trip. The clamp was attached to the handle of the stroller and with the extension raised the phone more than high enough to get a natural angle for the photo. This mount was more than secure enough to hold the phone but was super quick to mount/unmount the phone. Was able to compose the photo exactly how I wanted it and did not need to hope that some random stranger captured the photo the way I envisioned, which on average something I wanted is cut out of the photo. The only caveat is I accidentally dropped the mount attached to the solid tripod extension and the combined weight broke the MagSafe mount at the neck. Unfortunately did it twice and broke at the same spot, but luckily nothing a little bit of super glue couldn't fix and saved the rest of the vacation.",
