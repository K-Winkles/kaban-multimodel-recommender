                "reviewText": "The Neewer Photography Professional Heavy Duty Tripod Dolly with 2\" Rubber Wheels is an excellent product and an excellent value. We have tested the 2\" wheels version only in an interior studio with a smooth hard wood floor. The set-up is with with a professional Bogen 3040 tripod base and a 3063 Bogen head with a weight of 20lbs; and a Blackmagic Ursa Mini, plus rig, battery, and 200mm lens weighing 15 lbs, for a total of 35lbs. This Neewer Heavy Duty Tripod remains extremely stable and sturdy with very smooth rolling action for maintaining required composition following action laterally as well as for rolling push-ins and pull-outs. The brakes on the wheels are strong and tight.We were pleased to find that the minimal leg extension of the dolly at 10.8 inches is the approximate tripod leg extension we normally use for this camera-tripod set-up. Also, for our indoor studio use, the 2 inch wheels are more than sufficient. Regarding the minimal leg extension distance, the dolly is even sturdier since there is approximately double the leg strength without the telescoping out of the leg that extends the dolly out to 15.7 inches. We did not test the dolly at its maximum extension, since the minimum extension is perfect and super-strong for our use. At its maximum extension, there is certainly a slight flex to the legs when applying top to bottom hand pressure, though the flexing was not serious. We will update this review for rating when testing at max extension. For us, the important fact is that at the minimal extension, with one tube inside the other, there is absolutely no flexing, or bowing even with maximum hand pressure. So for our use and our conditions this Neewer dolly is a 5-star product. We will be ordering additional dollies for a second camera, and lights.",

                "reviewText": "Does exactly what it is suppossed to do, you do not have to buy a $500 dolly. The build quality is secure and runs excellently smooth. My sister and I used this dolly in conjunction with the Amazon 67-inch video camera tripod to make a video to advertise my sister's salon. The shots came out beautifully stable and the moving shots came out excellent on the hardwood floors. Sure, There were a few spots where we had to run the dolly over a wooden panel to achieve better smoothness but I would never consider this an issue with the dolly itself. If the floor has gouges in it no money can buy something that can change the fact that gravity will pull a wheel down (unless of course you are using a hover board as a dolly). The wheels are quiet, in fact I don't remember once hearing them, although we didn't need the audio that was recorded, as a long term thinker, I know this will be excellent for future productions. The wheels are bigger than I expected, roughly the size of grapefruit, (I find fruit to be an excellent form of measurement, thank you much) which helps for stability and the rubber lining is what makes them silent and the perfect balance between movement and static. Plus, the locks on the wheels make it so easy to make static shots.Don't expect shopping cart wheels on these. true I have not had them long but as long as I take good care of them I don't expect these wheels to veer in a direction they are possessed to desire or make unpleasant squeaking noises. again, definitely NOT like shopping cart wheelsI consider myself an amateur videographer with long term aspirations. I was looking for something that would be great for my introductory filmography and future filmography as I progress I don't expect to replace this with anything else within the next 5 years at least.",

                "reviewText": "For the price (2\" wheels version), this tripod dolly functions well as a light to medium weight capable, mobile solution for a small to medium video camera mounted to a video tripod. Using lighter weight tripods, you can get away with mounting a larger video camera. I'm using a heavy duty, Davis & Sanford video tripod with a Manfrotto 504 HD fluid head on top. I'm using Sony NX CAM's, external monitors and XLR mic's, adding more weight on top of the tripod and head. The dolly is strong enough to easily handle the load. While the dolly legs are constructed of strong aluminum; the center hub is only made from a fairly thin plastic. I expected a slightly stronger center hub. An aluminum hub would be nice, but the Neewer dolly handles my loads fine. The dolly does not extend far enough when the tripod is fully extended, but when the wheels are locked, the overall stability of the complete unit is still very stable and the dolly is still usable. The Manfrotto dolly is over $300 so this Neewer unit is an incredible bargain and serves my purposes. I purchased two of them so I can easily move a pair of in studio video cameras during shoots (mostly interviews with two or more subjects). I may have preferred the Neewer dolly with the 3\" wheels; it may have a stronger center hub, but I went with the 2\" wheels because they're priced $20 lower at the time. Overall, the adjustability and locking features make this dolly an incredible value for the budget producer keeping the load bearing under 40 pounds per dolly.",

I bought this last year but we didn't use it because it's huge when I widen my tripod our to the height we require - but a few weeks ago I was thinking, this can hold the tripod up no problem, with it's locking connectors for each foot. So I extended the legs of my tripod all the way, then we put it in this device on it's smallest setting. Sure, the middle of the tripod doesn't lock, but this is sturdy and fits in our kitchen. The wheels are a little small, but they roll well enough for us. My camera is a Canon professional camcorder and it's not top heavy.",

I had already tried individual castors that really were not up to the task for easy wheeling and the tripod tips were removed to allow a better fit but without success. Why I had not found the Neewer Dolly before I don't know but it took me under 3 minutes to fit it and it works perfectly. And what a price! Built with very strong, lightweight aluminium with steel components where the clever design needs them - all I can say is FANTASTIC!
