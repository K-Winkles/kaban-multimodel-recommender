        "description": "Money Tree features clusters of large, bright green leaves that look great and adds life to a brightly lit room at home, a lightly shaded porch, or in the office. It grows best near a sunny window. Provide the plant with as much light as possible, without placing it directly in sunlight. Water when the top couple inches of the soil are dry (about once a week) and be sure all excess water drains away. If the container does not have holes, use approximately one cup of water, adjust as needed for your environment. The height at dispatch is approximately 16 inches tall, measured from the bottom of the pot to the top of the plant. Money Tree is potted in a 6-inch diameter planter pot. Money Tree is a moderate grower depending on its environment and is hardy in USDA Zone 10. Give it a boost during the warm months of Spring and Summer with a general-purpose fertilizer that is formulated for house plants. Follow the instructions on the fertilizer package for the best use. When the plant out grows the current container, it is time to repot. To repot Pachira, gently remove it from its current container and place it into a slightly larger container. Fill in any empty spaces with new and fresh soil and water thoroughly. Be aware of third-party sellers; other companies try to imitate our quality. There are no other authorized Costa Farms sellers. Plants are living things; each one is slightly different, so the plant you receive may vary from the photo. Our growers hand-pick the healthiest and highest-quality plants.

                "reviewText": "I tried canceling the order when I realized it would not be coming on the expected date since I would be working all day and didn't want it sitting on the front porch in a box for 8 hours. I wasn't able to cancel, it did sit on the front porch for 8 hours, and when I opened it, it was so nicely packaged and looked absolutely amazing coming out of the box.There were some bugs on it but I'm assuming it's from sitting outside all day. There were two large handle holes, also used for air, on the sides, which had me relieved. I've never ordered a plant online until recently and wasn't sure what to expect. I did do my due diligence on researching what plant to order from Amazon from all the reviews and found this one to be the best and I wasn't disappointed.There are some brown spots and white spots on the tree but I'm hoping they'll go away over time. As long as it doesn't die. It's my first plant in many, many years for a reason. I simply couldn't make them last. I'm hoping to turn that around with this one as I'm a strong advocate for the environment and want to do my part in helping it. I'm also hoping this is a start to large garden one day.Regardless, point being, it's an incredible plant as you can tell from the pictures. The packaging was extremely well done and the plant arrived in great condition. The only complaint I have is the pot that it came in. Sure it's nice looking but it has no drainage holes. The pot itself also is much smaller than what I feel is described. I bought another pot online, an 8\" self-watering pot for $14, and it looks great in it. I wanted to buy a slightly larger pot anyway to put the plant in to give it more room to grow. From what I've read these plants can grow pretty large, given the space to, and the time, many years for sure.Also, while I was repotting the plant, first time doing that also, they were all connected at the bottoms by a rubberband that I decided to cut off to better get the old soil off to replace with the new one and also I just feel like that would potentially hold it's growth back.It definitely looks healthier than it's first few days. Now that it's been out of its box a bit longer and given fresh air and sunlight. However, today's the first day that I repotted it and I'm hoping I didn't mess anything up. I have a small room, with some roommates, and I'm going to make sure my room has enough air circulation by keeping a window fan in the windowsill blowing all throughout the day with my door open. Room can get a bit stuffy at times. When winter hits I may need to get a humidifier for my room also.For $32, I can't say that it's not worth it, especially for someone who doesn't own a car (all about that environment-friendly life, to the best that I can). The packaging is surprisingly exceptional, the plant itself is beautiful, it arrived a day or two later but that's not a big deal for a really nice plant. I would just like to see them ship plants in a pot with drainage holes, especially self-watering ones. It may cost a bit more, or a bit less, who knows, it would just be really nice, or at least being given the option to.5/5. Great plant, great company, and again, I really cannot say enough how great the packaging and delivery were, along with how beautiful the plant is. If it dies, it'll definitely be from my end but I'm definitely going to do everything that I can to make sure that doesn't happen. It's also actually five of them intertwined, which seems pretty obvious when you think about it but I didn't, and didn't notice it until I was repotting it. Love this plant. Buy it. Just buy it now and support this company.",
