I placed them the way the picture was advertised. My walls are a light blue-ish color and idk how but these little stickers didn\u2019t disappoint with the colors. KEY TO GETTING THEM TO STICK AND NOT BUBBLE\u2026.CLEAN THE WALL! It looks great! No bubbling. Only been up for 15 min but looks great!",

                "reviewText": "They are NOT what is pictured at all. These are my top 3 bones to pick with this product, and yes there are more\u2026 but these are what irked me the most.1) if you have any type of humidity in your home, or where ever you decide to stick these, they WILL start to peel off the wall. I\u2019ve had these a few days, and by the evening of when I stuck them up the day I got them they were already coming off, even though I followed the instructions. And they won\u2019t stop peeling\u2026 no matter what I do\u20262) they have this awful pinkish tint to the \u201cbackground\u201d and boarder on them, so if you have any other color wall that\u2019s different than the background and boarder on them, even the most basic white paint color, you WILL see the left over boarder AND background on these, which really bugs me\u2026 a lot. It looks like a dirty ring behind and around the baskets.3) they are SUPER glossy!!!! So they of course do not even for a second pass off as real baskets\u2026 they would have been a lot more realistic in a matte vinyl.",
