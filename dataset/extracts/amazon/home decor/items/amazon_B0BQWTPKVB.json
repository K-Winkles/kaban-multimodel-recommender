                "reviewText": "Bought two of these for our kitchen. One is as pictured in mint green, the other almost appears grey. I thought maybe the lighting, but even switched positions and the color just isn't there on the second mat. Very disappointed in the colors not matching as expected, otherwise the mat itself is good quality.Update: Rating drop from 3 to 1...these mats are easy to trip over and stain easily. Very regrettable purchase!",

                "reviewText": "I needed new mats in the kitchen since I was moving in with my now husband. My old ones were damaged and not fitting the vibes. Anyways I love the thickness and cushioning it has. It\u2019s very supportive. Especially since we don\u2019t have a dish washer. My back always hurts regardless but this makes standing over the sink and stove better. Plus the color is accurate and I love the texture as compared to the rubbery ones. If you have a cat just FYI They like to scratch it and I will damage a smidge.",

It's also not easily washable. We have somewhat hard water which probably makes drips more noticeable but this mat looks pretty gross after a while. And unfortunately, it's not as easy as wiping up drips because it absorbs the water instantly.",
