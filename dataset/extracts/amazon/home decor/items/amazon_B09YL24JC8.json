It's a very good size for the price and the leaves are pretty good replicas of a live Bird of Paradise plant. The leaves have some wire in the stem so you can position them. The basket it comes in is nice as well although small, but size is as advertised. One issue we had, the cement they put around the base to weight it down cracked in shipping. I was able to put it back in place but it's not enough to weight the plant, and I don't think it would be even unbroken. I'll buy some gravel and fill the basket and see how it goes, for now I place it resting on the tub and wall to stay upright.",
