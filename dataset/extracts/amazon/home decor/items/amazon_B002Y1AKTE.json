                "reviewText": "Came securely packed, which I appreciated, since cast iron is brittle (see pictures). They arrived undamaged; the protective cardboard stuck to the surface in places, but it's easy to wash off. I love the look and heft of these; the surfaces are not machine-smooth, but that adds to their charm; there are no slubs or spiky bits. Be aware that the prong reaches well past the balls in the vertical plane, so if your intent is to use it as a bookend, the prong alone will touch the books.",
