It is much smaller than expected but I suppose you could see that in their photos but also not exactly shown next to a hand for scale. Mine has very sharp corners, edges and corner joints making little spikes. If you reach for a remote at night you\u2019re going to hit them and get poked or scratched. Also there are no rubber or flyer feet so I\u2019ll add those. And also mine had one end with a greenish tint and one side that is split and 2 pieces of wood glued together with different colors so it looks bad. And you can\u2019t in my case turn it to the back as mine needs to go end back on the table. A good start but not as refined as it could be.",
