These look nice and are the perfect size to hold floss.Other than floss - things that would fit perfectly in these containers would be q-tips, hair ties, chapsticks, cotton balls or rounds, or bobby pins.

They are plastic and that was ok to me since I have little kids if they where to fall they wouldn\u2019t shatter. The top is made from bamboo with it\u2019s really nice. I do have to add that I was a little surprised they where a little smaller then expected. I should have paid more attention to details in description.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the 4-pack Qtip Holder Dispenser with Bamboo Lids and have been quite pleased with the product. While they are on the smaller side, I found that their size is still sufficient for everyday use. Their compact nature actually works well for my space, ensuring they don't dominate the area they're placed in.The bamboo lids are a standout feature, adding a touch of class and a natural aesthetic that blends seamlessly with various decor styles. The holders themselves are well-crafted and durable, holding up well with regular use.One of the aspects I appreciate most about these holders is their classy look. They manage to elevate the mundane act of reaching for a Q-tip into a more refined experience. The clear containers combined with the bamboo lids create a look that is both modern and timeless, making them a versatile choice for any bathroom.In terms of functionality, these holders do the job perfectly. They keep Q-tips clean and easily accessible, and the lid fits snugly, ensuring that the contents stay dry and hygienic.Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase and would definitely consider buying it again, either for myself or as a thoughtful gift for a friend. If you're looking for a stylish, functional, and space-saving solution for your bathroom essentials, this set is definitely worth considering.",
