It comes with a remote which is not mentioned in the product description. I love that the whole clock has an RGB coloring effect, not just certain dials. There are a good number of RGB color options as well. It looks good at night, especially the RGB coloring effect. The accent light can be useful depending on where you install it, but it is not bright. I wish the accent light was on all sides, not just the bottom. It would have been perfect if it had 360 RGB accent light. Otherwise, it is a very good product. The price is reasonable. I like all controls are via the remote which is super convenient. I like the stopwatch option which I can initiate via remote. It's super helpful for me.",

A remote control (with battery) is included that has separate buttons for different settings so it's easy to set and change. The settings are also changeable by buttons on the right-side of the clock itself. The color options are good. I chose the solid red color as it's easy to read (and not blinding bright) whether the room lights are on or off. And I turned off the underside lighting as it's only white light without ability to change color.I bought from seller 'TooTa Shop' and am happy.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I was in the market for a room clock that can also double as a desk clock. Preferred a green font design and built-in calendar. There are so many on Amazon but glad that I landed on this particular model.At first glance, I was impressed by the Auto-Daylight Saving Time feature. Then realized it had other features including customizable countdown timer and temperature read-out.Added bonuses include an actually comfortable soft touch remote, which usually doesn't get included with clocks. The ones I've seen elsewhere are just pure plastic, but this remote has actual rubber buttons that give a satisfying click to them.Then, there's the flat sides design that allows the clock to sit on a countertop or desktop with very minimal bezels for a modern vibe. It also has notches that hang flush on a wall (and this vendor even includes a kit for you to do a wall mount at no charge)! Was very pleased with this thought.Further, a USB adapter and a very generous cable is included with the clock. I'd estimate the length to be 8 feet which makes this clock easy to install anywhere in a room.Another surprise that impressed me was in the back of the clock, there a built-in knob that you can wrap any unused length around the knob to neatly hide the white cable. Never seen an intelligent thought-out refinement like this on a clock.Note that the cable and USB adapter are both white so what you will see in the open, all matches cleanly like an iPhone. Very classy look, not some cheapo cable and adapter thrown into a box like other products!Speaking of the box, I've taken a photo of the packaging as my first impression was that this, in fact, is a quality item. There was a sense of polish to everything in the unboxing process. And all items were wrapped in fine plastic wrappings (more like film than bag). Again, not some cheapo plastic like you would expect for \"just a clock purchased online\".Finally, the centerpiece of this clock was the various color schemes of the display and the built-in dimmer (4 levels). One mode was particularly well adapted to a Gamer's setup with alternating continuous color change, that showcased all the LED capabilities built-in. Video of that has been attached to this review.There is also one mode that isn't noted anywhere in the reviews by other customers, which is a white with light blue-grey tint mixed together. Never seen a color like that on a room/desk clock and added to the sophistication of the product.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is a very nicely designed product and I attached a video of the many features. I also itemized a few things below that I really like:1. The wall attachment hardware is included and leaves extremely small pin-holes in the wall but are very stable. The holes in the wall with the included hardware are super small - amazing. It also comes with a template for easy positioning on the wall. No additional hardware is needed.2. The cord wrap is recessed and holds the entire length of the cable that may be wound around the spool without protruding out from the recessed compartment. This is great if you want to position the clock directly above an outlet. Also the cord is super thin and uses a standard USB-A connection to a modular wall plug. The plug is 5v output and 2000mAmps.3. There is a nice white frame option. Not many clocks have a white frame option. The frame is also very low-profile.4. The remote is small but well-labeled and the interface is super intuitive. In the attached video, I was pretty sure there was a way to turn off the Timer feature once set (but I didn't read the instructions prior to doing the video) and there is: You simply hold down the timer button again for 2 seconds. Also the instruction booklet is very nice and easy to read.5. The clock has buttons on the side that enable time / alarm setting functionality.6. There is a nice night light feature that is cool white in temperature.7. There are several brightness settings and an \"Auto-Dim\" function that dims the display one level when the lights go out.8. There is a lifetime warranty upon registration at the company website with your Amazon order number.No regret purchase! The only thing I would have liked would be a 9v or button battery-backup feature.",

                "reviewText": "This was a gift for both my grandmother and my brother for the holidays. They both loved it! It appeals to various ages, which is unique for an item. For my grandmother, it is big enough for her to read and see the time, weather, and date; it even has a night light she can use. My brother likes it because it looks cool on the wall, you can change the display's color, and it can also be used to play music. If you are thinking about a useful and awesome gift for anyone in your life, this is a must-buy. We liked it so much we got one for our own house.",
