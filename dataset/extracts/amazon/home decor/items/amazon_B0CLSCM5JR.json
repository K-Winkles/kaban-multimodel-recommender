                "reviewText": "I hope to find similar vases. The undulating form reminds me of marine life. I am not sure if these are handmade, but they appear to be and then made into a mold. As a ceramicist, who is not in the business of mass producing, this would be a difficult design to reproduce by hand alone. The thin edging lends to how delicate this piece is. The panel pieces remind me of flagellates propelling themselves though fluid. Despite the fragile appearance, it has a solid structure. Just be careful and pretend it is glass. I can see how easy it would be to knock a ridge off with carelessness.The color of the clay is a beautiful off-white, eggshell color. I'm not the best at distinguishing different names for cream or white. However, it is nautral enough to match the organic nature of the shape. There are small flecks of natural material that I find complementary. You can not see them from a distance. It reminds me a bit of bread or pasta made of different grains.This has to be my favorite piece. The color and display matter have endless options. It will certainly be a conversation piece as well. How could you not take notice of this vase?! I would love to have the black one as well. Though the price is a tad steep for me at $28, I have to keep in mind that this is hopefully a vase I will have for decades to come. In this light, it is worth every penny. I wish I were still working in the studio because I feel inspired to make a floor vase that would compliment. I recommend 10/5 stars.",

It can definitely stand alone without adornment because of its excellent sculptural quality. It's just ... nice ... and interesting ... to look at, even all by itself.I noticed the interior of the vase appeared to me to be only partly glazed, although the listing clearly says that you can put fresh flowers (with water?) into this vase. You may want to test it out over the sink first.This vase can definitely be used with dried flowers and if it will hold liquid, a reed diffuser with essential oil would be lovely.",
