                "reviewText": "The good:The leaves look real enough. I say that because my grandmother (a gardener) thought they might be real, when she saw them (there were desks in front of the bottom half, so there could have been pots under the vines). The veins are visible on both sides, and they're decent quality, and most were not wrinkled, so if you're just sitting in a room next to them, and they're arranged like a real plant, they can easily pass for a real plant. If you examine it closely, or just drape one vine on a wall, however, it will be identified as fake.The not so good:There was (very little) shedding, initially, and none at all since arranging them the first time.As expected, I did have to hang the vines outside for a day or two, to get rid of the smell.Though the description makes it sound like there are a lot of vines in this offer, it didn't actually cover a lot of space. (see the pic). The area covered is about 3 feet wide, and 5 feet long, but as you can see, it is sparse.Overall I do recommend these, and have already purchased a second set.",

They look lovely together.make sure to air them out , they have a sickly sweet smell to them at first, and give them a rather vigorous shaking as well, there\u2019s a TON of manufacturing plastic pieces that will fall off of them like a Christmas tree.they come in long separate strands of like 8 feet each, which totally makes it easier to detangle and work with, i\u2019ve used about half of the vines so far, but plan to add more as I work my way around my room.",

                "reviewText": "I'd give this product a better review if it wasn't for the funny smell and the crazy amount of shedding and dust that came with the product. Overall, it looks very nice. It's a lovely color, and I feel like you get your bang for your buck. There is a good amount of it for the cost. When you open the package though, you get hit with this pretty obnoxious chemical smell though. It isn't overpowering or anything, but it's kind of unpleasant. They also shed these tiny little micro fibers and mine had a lot of dust inside too. I had to take them outside and give them a little shake. It still didn't stop me from sneezing all over the place though, lol. Worth the buy, for sure. But, if you're going to get them, I strongly suggest opening it up outside and maybe letting the fresh air get some of that funny smell out. I sprayed mine with some peppermint oil and that helped.",

                "reviewText": "Ich habe dieses Produkt 2x gekauft, weil mich das Foto zu diesem Angebot sowie die positive deutsche Kundenrezension \u00fcberzeugten und bin von beiden Verpackungsinhalten mega entt\u00e4uscht.Beim \u00d6ffnen der Verpackungen kam mir beide Male sehr \u00fcbler Geruch und eine gro\u00dfe Wolke Plastikstaub und entgegen, dessen Einatmen ich leider nicht ganz verhindern konnte.Nun brennen meine Schleimh\u00e4ute und ich werde den Geruch nach angeschmortem Plastik seit Stunden nicht mehr aus der Nase los. Igitt! Gesund ist das garantiert nicht!Nach n\u00e4herem Betrachten der Efeustr\u00e4nge kann ich nun sagen, die Qualit\u00e4t dieses k\u00fcnstlichen Efeus ist miserabel. Die Plastik-Str\u00e4nge sind unsauber geformt und haben \u00fcberall \"noppelige Plastik-Nasen\", die Bl\u00e4tter sind v\u00f6llig platt, sehr d\u00fcnn bis durchsichtig und zum Teil schief bedruckt.Echtem Efeu kommt dieses optisch nicht mal ann\u00e4hernd nahe. Das gelieferte Produkt hat mit dem im Angebot abgebildeten nicht viel gemeinsam.Ich rate von dem Kauf dieses Produktes daher ganz klar ab und werde es selbst definitiv retournieren.Leider kann ich den Verk\u00e4ufer einer fr\u00fcheren Efeugirlanden-Bestellung von vor etwa einem Jahr bei amazon nicht mehr finden. Dieser hatte qualitativ wirklich hochwertige, ziemlich echt aussehende Kunstpflanzen zu einem \u00e4hnlichen Kaufpreis.",
