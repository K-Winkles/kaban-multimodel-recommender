                "reviewText": "I am an electrical contractor, and we hang hundreds of fixtures a year; this is the best fixture ever! Words cannot adequately express how pleased we were with not only the quality of the fixture, but the clever packaging as well. When we received the fixture we thought the box was rather small and assumed there would be endless assembly required, we were fooled! The fixture was folded flat in a cardboard housing and held stable for shipment. This enabled the fixture to come out of the box and simply unfold with zero assembly required! The quality of the fixture surpasses the expectations of this price point. The center stem is glass and adds sparkle to the fixture, the arcrylic \"gems\" or crystals remind me of a Z Gallerie fixture we purchased (and cost 5 times what this fixtures did!). The chain and cord is about 5' long, more than adequate for most installations. The canopy kit is a standard style with lock ring, which makes for easy installation. Additionally, it comes with all new hardware in case your putting it in a new home. We installed these in a customers bathroom; they had the old style arcrylic plastic lenses with a fluorescent fixture behind them. They were on a budget and did not want to rip the ceilings out; rather than go with the old style and add new arcrylic, we recommended handing a small chandelier and creating a tray type ceiling. As you can see in the photos, both the hall and master bathrooms came out splendid! The price point and the quality combine to make for a fixture that I will definitely recommend time and again; I am excited about using this fixture and hope I can find a place for the multicolor, it seems so festive and lively! I will also put one in my youngest daughters bedroom, stay tuned for that review and pictures! Thank you Gyspy Color for an amazing quality product!",

Having an outdoor wedding and we still wanted it to be as elegant as possible and needed a plug in style, since there will be no place to directly wire from the ceiling. To rent from the tent company was the same price per chandelier as to purchase! I assembled the lights to be sure they worked, as well as be sure all the parts were there since the wedding is months away. They were easy to assemble and will for sure give us the elegant look we want and additional lighting at night. Can't wait to see it all come together. We plan on selling them later to another bride & groom with an outdoor venue.",
