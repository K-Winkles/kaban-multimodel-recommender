I found these and decided to give them a try and I'm so glad I did! They look amazing. (I chose the pack with 3 different colors since I have dark brown furniture.)When they arrived, they were very well packed and easy to open. (I ordered 2 packs) They did shed a little, but nothing too drastic and I didn't notice much of a smell. I added paper about halfway up in my vase since it was so deep and then placed the pampas grass in and arranged them. I would definitely recommend.",

They are full and bushy, very realistic, a perfect colour with nice variation and so far don't shed (other than initially when I was stuffing them in the container). They come in small tubes and you wonder if they'll ever fluff out. The recommendation is to put them out in the sunshine for a few hours. I didn't think they looked that bad (see the third picture) but I went for it an put them outside. Wow! What a difference (pictures 1 and 2). They add a great boho look to a room. Highly recommend!",
