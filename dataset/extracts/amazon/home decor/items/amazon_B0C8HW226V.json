The product instructions say they can be removed and re-applied, but I'd question that. The adhesion is solid and very strong. These were easy to apply and are clearly marked as to which side is to be applied to the rug and to the floor. The only issue I had was the rug side paper was a bit difficult to peel away. The floor side paper removed easily. Excellent product.",

That\u2019s the only reason for the four star rating. I highly recommend this product.",

Adhesion was excellent for about 4 wks, then the gripper patches completely released the runner but remained adhered to the floor. Low-traffic area, so I doubt there was excessive pulling/pushing pressure against the patches. I\u2019ve tried many other types of grippers in the past, with LESS success, so this was the best so far, but still unsuccessful.",
