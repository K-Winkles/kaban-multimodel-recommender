I purchased these mostly for the aesthetics -for how they look- and not necessarily for the 'scent.' When I removed them from their box, I immediately noticed they were dry, cracking, flat, and had little scent. I let them sit out for a day and they remained the same, so I came here to review the item as being OK, but for whatever reason, I decided to wet the stems (since they are advertised as being used in the shower). This really made them flourish in how they look, feel, and smell! Super happy with my purchase!All I did was run them under some warm water and immediately the scent filled the room. They were not dry anymore and I was able to run my fingers up and down the stem to straighten out the leaf's and fluff them out. I placed them all over my home, mixing them in with other real and imitation plants. ^_^",

I thought it would be better and more fragrant than buying from a chain store where inventory might sit in a warehouse for months before hitting the shelves. I was wrong. When I opened the box there was very little scent and just about all of the leaves were flattened. I can only assume by looking at them that they\u2019ve been processed for the essential oils already and what I bought was the leftover product after the branches were pressed and processed. Fantastic business move for the big business who extracts the eucalyptus oil but a crappy move on their part to sell their trash to unsuspecting consumers and advertise it as fresh and aromatic. I read reviews from others some good some not so good. One person suggested running them under water to hydrate the leaves. She thought it brought out the fragrance more and made the leaves appear fresh so I tried that. It did work to help bring life back to the leaves but didn\u2019t do a thing as far as the scent. I\u2019m pretty disappointed to have wasted money buying processed trash. Big business\u2026.. Do better for consumers",

I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t last long, but I love the way they look so I\u2019m ok with that.I did soak them for a few minutes and then pulled them apart.

When I opened the box, the eucalyptus smelled off but this was my first time ordering and even attempting to use eucalyptus in my shower. I place it on my shower head and there was no scent. I read in a couple reviews that I needed to soak it in cold water and that made the color run. Green coloring was coming out as I sprayed the eucalyptus with my shower head. I then tried using it while in the shower again and still no scent. I went really close to try and smell it but all I smelled was a weird chemical plastic smell. Sadly, I will be throwing all 3 bundles of eucalyptus away. The smell gave me a head ache.I gave it 2 stars because the eucalyptus is vey pretty and can be used for display purposes only.",
