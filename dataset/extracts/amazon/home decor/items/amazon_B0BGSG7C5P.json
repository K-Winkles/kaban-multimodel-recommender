                "reviewText": "I love this .. it\u2019s so simple yet adds just the right touch. The only thing I\u2019d change is the greenery. What I received was pretty short/small and looked as if it were just leftovers from others that had been put together. I will purchase some greenery elsewhere to get the fuller look instead of left overs. Otherwise I love it. The lights will be easy to replace if I should ever need to. They just lay loosely inside the jar. This could also be done a little nicer with something for it the lights to rest on but it\u2019s still a great purchase and I\u2019d buy it again.",
