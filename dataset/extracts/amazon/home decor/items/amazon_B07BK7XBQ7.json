I still receive the print version but I want the kindle version also when it first appeared. This magazine never disappoints. If you love country, farmhouse, cottage style in your home, you will love this magazine, too. It is a delicious treat every time it arrives with its beautiful photography and well written articles as well as other helpful information. I give it five stars easily and I jump for joy that it has returned.",
