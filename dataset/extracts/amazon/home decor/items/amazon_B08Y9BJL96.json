The whole family loves it!Item came nicely packaged, shipped and delivered within a few days as promised, and is weary well made and easy to use.Takes just a few moments to place nails in wall to hang and was a relatively quick and easy install on the wall.So easy to display artwork, pictures, notes, etc. just open the front display door, insert item into holding bands, and shut door. Love that you can easily change the displayed item as needed.Photo box holds a good amount of pages and holding bands keep items in place.Photo display box is very well made, sturdy, and looks very nice. Purchased item with white frame and it compliments my home perfectly. Highly recommend and would purchase again.",

                "reviewText": "Americanflat Front Loading Kids Art Frame Is simply fantastic!! We\u2019ve used it so much, that as we\u2019ve had more kids, we\u2019ve bought one for each one! It\u2019s easy to hang and it has two elastic straps inside it to help keep the kids\u2019 art in place. I highly recommend the Americanflat Front Loading Kids Art Frame, because it helps to display each child\u2019s artwork without cluttering the walls or fridge. We\u2019ve bought each one in black, to help keep the room decor\u2019s simple, and it helps keep the children\u2019s drawing to really stand out. My kids love seeing their artwork displayed!The Americanflat Front Loading Kids Art Frame has also helped us rotate artwork regularly. The case is deep, so it can hold numerous pictures at a time. This has been an incredible feature. I get to display new works of art, but upon requests we can display something they drew a while back, because it all fits inside neatly inside the frame! I absolutely recommended Americanflat Front Loading Kids Art Frame!!! It\u2019s elegant, simple, and priced right!!",

It gives their masterpieces the attention they deserve without overwhelming your wall space.Mat Included: The included mat adds a professional touch to your child's artwork.
