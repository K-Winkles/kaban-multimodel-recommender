The little vases are an ideal size and very clear; no bubbles, etc. in the glass.Want to root a heavier or taller cutting that makes the vase tip? Simply move the rubber washers on each side so they're snug against the vase and\u2014viola!\u2014no more tipping.While the vase neck is too narrow for my usual glass washing brush, it's easy to clean with a folded sponge or a bottle brush. I like the foam ones; they're like a bristle bottle brush and a sponge had a baby.Lastly... Terrarium? Not even close, XXXFLOWER Store. ;)",

I chose to assemble it for her as a gift, but it would be very hard to try to wrap!It is a bit delicate, but with a little care this could be a nice addition to her kitchen counter for many years. Assembly was a piece of cake!",

I bought it as a project for my son to put together and he loved it, finished it in about 10 minutes and then we found the correct plants to put inside the bulbs. It looks so pretty on the bookshelf and just add another touch of life to our home. I am so glad we purchased this.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the FLOWER Plant Terrarium with Wooden Stand, Air Planter Bulb Glass Vase Metal Swivel Hold, and while its appearance is undeniably beautiful, I have some concerns about its durability and packaging.On the positive side, this terrarium adds an elegant touch to my living room. The combination of the wooden stand, air planter bulb glass vase, and metal swivel hold creates a visually appealing display that catches the eye. It brings a sense of sophistication to any space and has received compliments from visitors.However, I was disappointed to find that the glass vase arrived cracked. It seems that the packaging was insufficient to protect the delicate glass during shipping. This was a letdown, as I expected better attention to detail when it comes to packaging fragile items.Moreover, the overall sturdiness of the terrarium is questionable. It feels fragile and delicate, raising concerns about its long-term durability. It's important to handle it with utmost care to avoid any accidental damage.In conclusion, while the FLOWER Plant Terrarium with Wooden Stand, Air Planter Bulb Glass Vase Metal Swivel Hold has an appealing design, its fragility and poor packaging leave much to be desired. I would recommend the manufacturer to improve the packaging to ensure safe delivery and consider reinforcing the product's structure. If you decide to purchase it, be prepared to handle it delicately.",
