The mopping pads can be thrown in the washing machine. Best of all it doesn\u2019t leave streaks on the floor, so the floor actually looks clean when you\u2019re done. I don\u2019t usually get excited about things like mops, but this one makes my life easier. Best mop ever.",

                "reviewText": "Have you ever dreamed of being a Jedi, wielding a mop instead of a lightsaber, fighting off the dark forces of grime on your laminate and hardwood floors? Well, Rubbermaid's Reveal Spray Microfiber Floor Cleaning Kit makes that dream a reality!Upon unboxing this bad boy, I felt a surge of cleaning power as if I was holding Excalibur. The assembly was as easy as pie \u2013 even easier than pie, actually, more like making a sandwich. *Click*, *snap*, and ta-da! I was armed and ready to vanquish dust and stains.The reusable washable pads are the unsung heroes of this mop saga. They're like loyal sidekicks that never let you down. Pop one on, fill the spray bottle with your preferred cleaning solution (mine was a homemade concoction that smelled suspiciously like lemons), and you're on your way to a cleaner kingdom.The spray action is where the magic happens. A gentle squeeze of the trigger releases just the right amount of cleaning solution, not too much to flood the kingdom, nor too little to leave spots untouched. The microfiber pad eagerly absorbs the mess like a thirsty sponge in a desert.Now, let's talk about the maneuverability. This mop glides across the floor with the grace of a figure skater. I even threw in a few spins and twirls \u2013 okay, maybe I got carried away, but it was fun! The handle is comfortable and sturdy, unlike some flimsy mops that feel like they might snap mid-battle.But wait, there's more! It's not just a mop; it's a multitasking warrior. Want to reach under furniture? Simply bend it like Beckham, and this mop gets low without breaking a sweat. It's a limbo champion in the cleaning world!However, every hero has its kryptonite. The refillable bottle sometimes decides it's fun to play hide-and-seek with the trigger, making me wish for a GPS tracker. Also, I had to channel my inner Houdini to remove the pad for washing \u2013 a bit more effort than anticipated.In conclusion, Rubbermaid's Spray Mop is a force to be reckoned with in the battle against grime and dirt. It's a cleaning sidekick that turns mundane chores into an epic quest. So, if you're looking to turn cleaning into a heroic adventure, grab this mop and unleash your inner Jedi \u2013 just watch out for the refillable bottle's vanishing act!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ll start by saying that I really don\u2019t like cleaning. I look for any ways to cut down on the amount of time it takes, so a spray mop is a must-have. The problem is spray mops are notorious for breaking but so far the reveal mop\u2019s been solid as they come.Here\u2019s my breakdown of the mop based on my experience with it so far.Overall Build Quality - Although the mop is mostly plastic (except the pole), it still feels like high quality. It\u2019s lightweight with no setup required and the pivoting head makes it easy to reach anywhere.Sprayer/Bottle - The spray has some serious range! If you have the handle tilted back it will spray about 6 feet ahead. The spraying range can be decreased simply by tilting the handle into a more vertical position. The bottle also seems to work very well. I haven\u2019t noticed any leaking when removing/reinstalling it and it\u2019s easy to refill.Pads - Now the pads are the one aspect of this mop I think could be improved. After all, the pads are the part of the mop that\u2019s picking up all the dirt. The Rubbermaid pads are not terrible, pretty much your standard microfiber mop pad. But they\u2019re a bit on the thin side and I can tell they aren\u2019t going to hold their form very well after washing - they were already a bit wrinkly when they were fresh out of the box. The small scrubber pad is a nice touch but I\u2019m hesitant to use it on my wood floors since it\u2019s fairly abrasive.That said the pads are the easiest part of the mop to fix. I saw some other reviews that mentioned different pads called turbo pads ( these ones ) so I grabbed a pack of those as well. These are noticeably thicker (see pictures) and appear to use two types of fabric. I\u2019ve only used them a couple times so far but they pick up dirt and cat hair really well. Basically fixing the main issue I had with the mop.So overall I\u2019m very happy with this mop. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I still don\u2019t like cleaning, but the reveal mop makes it a bit better - even my cat approves.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this mop when I decided it was time to rethink my lifelong method of washing floors on hands and knees with a bucket and a rag. I\u2019ve owned other mops but found them not worth the trouble. So far, I like this one pretty well. The upsides are: any brand of cleaning fluid can be used in the container; the container is easy to remove and fill; the container can site upright on a flat surface (such as a countertop) when being filled; the mop is lightweight and easy to maneuver; the cleaning pad is easy to remove and clean in the washer; the mop head is large enough to clean a floor rather quickly; the spray nozzle works well. The downsides: because the mop head is large, it\u2019s hard to get it into small spaces; the spray sometimes goes onto the baseboards or other areas adjacent to the floor. Overall, a good product.",

We are only buying a new one because we shifted countries. The other important fact is that the mopping surface is always level and covers the full area of the pad, unlike other mops which can lift at the edges. The pads are durable and work well. The entire product is well constructed.The only disappointment was not related to the mop itself but to the shipping company used by Amazon to send the product to Spain. Two shipments were lost, and the company used has a bad reputation which does not reflect well on Amazon. Of course this experience probably won\u2019t apply in Germany or other EU states.",
