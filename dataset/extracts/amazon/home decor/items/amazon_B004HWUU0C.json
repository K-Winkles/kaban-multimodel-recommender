I'm glad I didn't - this fixture looks much, much better when installed than it does straight out of the box. I use soft white frosted bulbs with a linen chandelier shades (link below) - the combination puts off a very pleasing warm light that plays well with the brown metal of this fixture. The combination of the metal leaves and the crystals results in a really unique style that is both somewhat rustic and elegant. I have it above a 84'' x 42'' table, and the size is perfect. I have a lot of plants in my dining room and the metal leaves look really great against the leaves of the plants. Urbanest Linen Chandelier Lamp Shades, 6-inch, Hardback Clip On, Oatmeal(set of 6)",

                "reviewText": "I am so happy with this chandelier. The finish is a very pretty brown-ish base with a burnt gold effect. We wanted something that would go with our oil rubbed bronze window hardware but didn't want a black chandelier. They look great together. The crystals are so sparkly and the fixture looks beautiful whether it is on or off, all throughout the day. We do not have an eat in kitchen, so we eat all meals in our dining room. We wanted something that was elegant but not overly fancy and this looks perfect. Our dining room is only 10' x 10' and this hangs above a 42\" table. I was concerned this would be too big, but it makes a statement in a small space without being overpowering. Highly recommend - we had considered the Camilla chandelier from pottery barn but went with this one due to price, and now that I have seen it in person I love it even more than the one we originally wanted.I will say that the installation was not easy. My husband had installed a couple light fixtures before but was by no means a pro. It took a lot of cursing and frustration between the two of us to get this installed, and the directions for installation are very poor (vague, leaves out steps, and tons of misspellings). If you don't know what you are doing definitely hire someone to install it!",
