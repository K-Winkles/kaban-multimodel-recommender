                "reviewText": "1. The bunny tails are a true black! The color is cohesive all around.2. The tails are nice and fluffy. If you leave them outside in the sun like the directions say, I\u2019m pretty sure that they will open up nicely. I didn\u2019t do that because I\u2019m impatient, but since the pack comes with TWO bundles, I will try to do that with the second one when needed.3. The package is nicely put so that in transit the plants won\u2019t crush. I appreciate that. You get two bundles if you want a fuller look. I opted to just use one.4. The package comes with directions which are easy to understand! Good job.5. These will shed quite a bit when taking them out of their wrap. This is normal and all you have to do is spray the plants with a strong hold hair spray and the shedding will cease to little to none. (This is also on the directions) Once I sprayed the bundle, the fall out stopped.6. These are true to size. The stems are not dyed black but I didn\u2019t mind that because my vase hides the stems. If you are looking for a black stem, you can spray paint them yourselves.Overall, I would buy from this supplier again. Especially for colored pampas.",

It is quite messy and needs to be shaken well in an area where you're prepared for LOTS of fluffy mess! When you first open it, it will look nothing like the photos in the ad. It needs sun or some soft heat from a blow dryer (if you live in the frozen tundra of Canada like I do) to get it to fluff up and get billowy. I took it into the garage and took the blow dryer to each individual piece. With some time and patience, I'd say it all tripled in size. I let it sit for a few days in the vase afterward to fall a bit more and I then sprayed it some some strong hold hairspray to stop further shedding. It is so pretty and I'm now wondering why I didn't buy it sooner!",
