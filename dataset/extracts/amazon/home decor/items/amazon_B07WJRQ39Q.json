By the second day, it was really too strong. I added all the reeds at once, which was a mistake. So I took 2 reeds out of each one and now it\u2019s perfect! My living room is pretty big and the jasmine scent is really nice. I highly recommend the diffuser and am going to buy one for my bathroom. I will only add 2 reeds as my bathroom isn\u2019t very large. The diffuser is bigger than I thought it would be, but I\u2019m very happy with my purchase! I will add to this review once I\u2019ve had these for a few weeks. I\u2019m curious to see how long the scent will last.",

I also do not know if I would recommend this for very small spaces, especially if they are confined often by a doorway, as the scent is very potent and strong (which is a good thing!). The scent is amazing... everyone compliments the smell when they arrive. I have this in my entryway and you can smell it into my living room and kitchen... it works super well. I wanted to get one for my bathroom but have not yet... If I do, I may only put 1 or 2 of the diffuser sticks in to try and minimize the scent a bit, as it can be so strong. I'm looking forward to trying other scents from this seller!",

I bought it for my 8x10 bathroom and with all the reeds in it I don\u2019t smell it when i come back an hour later. The packaging is pretty and it came with white flowers. Also, the flowers come with a mini clear test tube so I\u2019m not sure why other say their flower color leaks into the oil. Use the clear test tube that comes with it so the flowers don\u2019t sit in oil!! But on that note, it\u2019s very hard to flip the reeds over with the flowers and test tube. Each time I have to remove the flowers first then flip. More of a hassle and poor design. Maybe the neck could be larger to accommodate this. Anyway since the smell isn\u2019t as strong as I would have liked, I\u2019ll try a new brand.",
