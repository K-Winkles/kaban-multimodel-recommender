Only thing that's missing is a lego vase. I wish there was an option to buy one to build, I think that would be really neat. However, we will manage with the tradational vase we are using. Loved building this set. Most of the flowers have 2 that you build (2 daisy's, 2 lavender, etc.) This makes for a fun date night because you can each build flowers at the same time. I highly recommend this product.",

However, my wife and I still really enjoy sitting down together, each with a set, and spend some quality time while we build. It's so relaxing, and makes for a fairly inexpensive date night!We found these flower sets when we were looking for another set for my wife to make. We loved the idea and purchased this one. It's a beautiful set and looks great once assembled. She is looking forward to getting the other sets that go with this one to make bigger arrangements.I will say this set, while easy, is not the sturdiest set. Very small pieces and fragile builds make the flowers a small challenge, but worth completing. We will be buying more soon!",

We don't usually get live flowers in the house because our two cats will usually destroy them, but they leave these alone, and I get to have the aesthetic of flowers on the table but also the awesomeness and cleverness of Lego! I'm definitely going to buy more sets like this.",
