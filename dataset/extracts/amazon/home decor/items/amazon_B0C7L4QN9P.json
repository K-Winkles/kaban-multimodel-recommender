Jeder Kaktus sieht besser als als ein Kunstblume.Die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe empfinde ich als sehr gut, so kann man die Holzkiste auch in kleineren Nischen als Deko verwenden.Das Holz ist sehr leicht, aber insgesamt ist die Kiste stabil.Ich kann trotzdem nur 4 Sterne geben, weil die Kiste in meinen Augen gut 10 \u20ac zu teuer ist.Solche Artikel findet man in Aktionsm\u00e4rkten wesentlich preiswerter, im Laden h\u00e4tte ich diesen Artikel zu diesem Preis nicht mitgenommen.",
