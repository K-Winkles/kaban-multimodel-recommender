This tree exceeded my expectations and I couldn't be happier with it. The tree was easy to assemble and after a little fluffing looks fantastic. I paired it with a woven basket and it's perfect.",

                "reviewText": "I love plants and wish I could have big live plants, but with a clowder of cats, that is nigh impossible. Our live little cacti have some defense, but even they suffer a bit. Most of our live plants must be hung out of reach. So, to have lots of greenery, we have turned to faux plants. They are safer for the cats since many larger plants are poisonous to our feline friends. This is a really lovely Monstera and looks almost real. The only thing that bothers me are the two stickers to show how the top is supposed to fit on the base. The stickers do not come off easily and I will have to use some adhesive remover to get them completely off. I don't think it was really necessary to have the stickers, but maybe some people would have trouble figuring out how the square peg fits the square hole. Oh well. It is a minor thing and not worth deducting any stars. I'd love to get an even taller one, eventually. Now to get some nice pots for my \"plants\".",

                "reviewText": "This plant is okay but for the price, I wouldn't purchase it again. For starters, the whole thing is packaged completely loosely in the manufacturer's packaging. I'm not talking about Amazon's packaging, mind you, but the product manufacturer's. This allowed the plastic pot to break in transit, making it difficult to even stand up on its own. There is literally no packing material in the box with the plant at all. I found that quite strange. The stated height is true, however. The plant looks somewhat realistic once the two pieces are assembled and some bending of leaves and branches is completed. The pot, however...aside from being broken, it is undersized for the size of the plant and is very plain. I will have to \"replant\" this to a larger and more decorative pot to make good use of it.",

                "reviewText": "This is a really nice looking tree; I'm a former groundskeeper and horticulture lover and my wife is practically a dendrophile, so we expect a lot of artificial plants. The finish of the bark looks and feels real, and the branches and leaves look like they are real and growing naturally. The olives don't look great, but they don't stand out, either.Literally just one step to put together, top onto bottom and there are arrows on the trunk to line up to make it, somehow, even easier. Fluffing isn't too difficult, either, and the branches hold the shape you give them pretty well while being flexible enough to help make it look natural.",

It requires some spreading and primping, but I was very pleased to find the stems and leaves are thick and durable. I was able to really bend and spread without damaging or pulling the leaves off.Just add a pot! It arrives in a tiny black weighted pot that's way too small. It would be top-heavy to leave it standing alone like that. As soon as I placed it in a larger pot, it stood tall and it came to life. I'll probably add some moss or greenery at the bottom.You would never know this is a fake plant from just a few feet away.There are good fake and bad fakes - this is definitely a good one.",
