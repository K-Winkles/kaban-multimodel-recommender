They are not large, and my vases are very deep, so they do not sit all the way out but that is ok.I do caution you to open these outside as they do shed quite a bit and definitely leave them outside in the sun to fluff out. Mine probably could have stood some more time outside. Some of the smaller piece also have very brittle branches so they could break off - be gentle.This a trendy decorating item and I could see it sticking around for a while!",
