It required some effort, but not overly complicated. We received the product with minor fractures at the back, which was a bit disappointing.In terms of size, it's smaller than anticipated. It accommodates smaller items like perfumes, but larger ones may not fit comfortably.While described as \"clear,\" the stand has a slightly blueish tint, which may not be everyone's preference for display purposes.Despite these drawbacks, once set up, it does a decent job of organizing and displaying small items like figures, cupcakes, and perfumes.",
