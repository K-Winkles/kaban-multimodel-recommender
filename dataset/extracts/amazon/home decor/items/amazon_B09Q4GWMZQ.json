In the end, five different family members had a hand in building the finished item, which means it\u2019s not just beautiful, it has special memories to go with it.Because there are nine individual plants, each one of them is straightforward and rewarding for whoever builds it.I highly recommend this both for the fun of making it and the fact that it creates something beautiful which even my horrible gardening skills can\u2019t under/over-water!!",
