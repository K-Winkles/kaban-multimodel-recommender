I wanted something to make my hospital room feel a little more relaxing while I\u2019m in labor. This light will definitely do the job! I have been enjoying playing around with the different effects (you can toggle the 4 colors on/off to create your own color combos) and modes (how the lights switch between colors, if you want them to be dynamic). You can turn the brightness up and down as well as adjust the speed of the movements. The stars and the aurora can also be turned off individually- there are so many different ways to enjoy this product. The depth of the stars/aurora is crazy as well; I really could stare at the visuals for hours. All of these are features I didn\u2019t even realize this thing had when I decided to buy it. There are also several different preprogrammed sounds and a Bluetooth speaker that works great for the price. 5 star product in my book, definitely worth every penny!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this for my autistic son for help with his anxiety. I like the ability to change the combination of colors, red, green, blue, white into any combination you like. The laser stars fade in and out at a slow rate, which is nice, or you can turn them off. The movement of the swirl design is normal speed or no speed. I wish there was a slower speed to the swirl. The added sound features of thunder, water stream, ocean, morning birds and the ability to control the sound level is helpful as my son is hearing impaired. The control has the feature to auto shut off after a period of time, which we haven't tried yet. Instructions say don't operate more than 4 hours at a time. Best investment of my funds for this product.",

I put it on when im not putting on sims build videos in the background while running my credit card on gatcha gambling machines online.it werks. its gud. get it on sale.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for my daughter for Christmas because she loves anything to do with space. I took this picture just to check and make sure the projector worked before I gave it to her on Christmas. It was during the day and she has three large windows in her bedroom. Though the light was off, you can still see that even with natural light flooded in the room the still light came through pretty clearly on her ceiling. That was truly impressive. It\u2019s even more gorgeous at night. The only reason I\u2019m knocked a star off is because the sound feature didn\u2019t work. However, my daughter said it\u2019s not something she would use anyway cause it would drive her nuts so we didn\u2019t bother to exchange it. We are fine just using it as is. I would definitely buy it again though it\u2019s probably one of the better ones I\u2019ve seen. There\u2019s a lot of different settings . The one shown in the picture actually has motion and swirls around. Some are still, some are moving, colors vary and some have stars all around it. Overall I\u2019m extremely happy with my purchase . Best of all it shuts off after a couple hours . It has a remote so if she hasn\u2019t fallen asleep by then she can turn it back on without getting out of bed . Perfect",
