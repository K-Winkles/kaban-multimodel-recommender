I love what it says on it \"The Mystery of Growth\" and underneath it says \"Everything is Possible\". It can sit on a bookshelf in between books as it's the shpae of a hardback book. Or it can sit alone like I have it on my makeup mirror desktop. It is decor without being clutter as it is clear. Also, you can put any color flowers or foliage in it and it will compliment nicely. I absolutely love it and bought two extra as gifts...great idea to buy fresh flowers and take it in the vase as a gift! Great deal too!",
