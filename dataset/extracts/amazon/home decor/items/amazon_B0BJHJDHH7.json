This aesthetic spiral twirl candle dimensions are 4.41 x 4.41 x 4.45 inches, and its weight is 1.76 lbs.",
            "\u2705\u3010100% Natural and Safe\u3011- Our scented decorative aesthetic candles are all made of natural premium soy wax and cotton wicks that are safe for both humans and pets. Our spiral twirl candles are scented with citrus, creating a delightful ambiance in any space in your home or room.",
            "\u2705\u3010Perfect Gift Idea\u3011- Our decorative aesthetic spiral twirl candles are handcrafted and beautifully designed. They also come in exquisite packaging, making them the perfect gift option for your loved ones and for special occasions like weddings, birthdays, Christmas, Valentine's Day, and Thanksgiving.",
            "\u2705\u3010Easy To Use & Long Lasting\u3011- Trim the candle wick before burning to 6-8 mm. For the first time, burn this cute candle for at least two hours until the surface is evenly heated and melted. To avoid candle exposure, store it at 41-68 degrees Celsius. If extinguished and trimmed, our candles burn cleaner, slower, and longer than other soy wax scented candles (lasting 30+ hours).",
