                "reviewText": "I love that this tray is oval - it seems rare to find oval things instead or round or rectangular. And I love things with little feet like this has. I would probably like it more if I had not received another tray (round) with better workmanship and with the feet more intricately designed. The feet on these are are just little balls of wood. They work fine, are easy to screw in... and hardly noticable. The beading around the edge is ok too, but again, the workmanship could be finer. What I don't care for is how dark the stain is. It actually looks unnaturally dark - so not like the color of an actual wood. It makes me want to paint it white and distress it to save it from itself! Others are complaining about how it's light and will it hold heavy things... but this is an engineering question - the little well-distributed feet take care of this. I have 2 heavy big books and a lamp on top of mine and have no concerns about it not holding these things.",

                "reviewText": "Fantastically designed and made with solid wood. This tray is perfect for so many various home decors. Not only does this look aesthetically appealing, it can also be extremely practical for assorted situations. It can be utilized as a serving tray, decorative piece, or a tray for organizing perfumes or makeup on. For now, I have decided to use this beautiful tray as a place to organize my makeup for the week, which has not only allowed me to get ready faster but also gives me the ability to easily move the items should I need extra space on my desk at that moment.The tray is solid and has optional feet as well; whoever came up with the design idea for the optional feet, really thought it through well. The inside of the holes on the bottom of the tray, are actually lined with threaded metal, so when you go to screw the legs in they (1) screw in smoothly and you can get a nice tight fit that is also easy enough to remove, and (2) aren\u2019t slowly chipping away at a wood threading, giving you the ability to screw and un-screw the legs in repeatedly without worrying about destroying the threads.I think the size is quite good for my needs, especially as a daily makeup organizer. Though I can just as easily see me using this to set up d\u00e9cor on in whatever room it\u2019d be in, or as a bathroom tray for lotions, body creams/oils, cotton swabs, cotton balls, reusable skincare/makeup rounds, tissue, etc. Even in the kitchen it could find a place as a fruit holder or as a tray on our table that holds candles and seasonal d\u00e9cor. While the tray definitely gives off a rustic vibe, it fits in with our more modern, shabby-chic style, without issue. This beauty will last decades and decades.",

                "reviewText": "The tray is shaped very nicely. No rough edges or splintered in any way. The feet hardly take any effort to install, at most a minute or two. It is very much the popular look that is sought after in casual decor. In inspecting the tray, I will caution anyone that gets this, not to put a lot of weight on it. The center wood feels like thin plywood, but I can't say for sure that it is. In the description, it isn't stated as to the kind of wood used in the production of the tray. Also, further down the description page, it states, to clean the tray, wipe it down with a dry cloth. The only reason I bring this to light, is because very shortly after receiving any product, I always want to give it a cleaning or wash it. Whichever applies! I would have used a popular oil soap for wood furniture had I not read the tip on how to clean it! The tray itself is attractive and there are so many different ways to display it.! I will be putting 2 small artificial plants with a gorgeous small hand painted trinket box and LED flameless candle. I'm sure it will look charming!",

Still allowing the wood grain to show through. Giving it that rustic feel i like so much. The Tray is well made and sturdy. I would feel comfortable carrying the weight of several full glasses of liquid. Both with the durability of the craftsmanship and the ease and versatility of the handles. To finish it off there is a lovely ornate ring around the outer portion that gives it just that extra bit of class. There is a noticeable lighter tone to the unstained wood around the edges on the inside. I think it gives it charm. Not all would agree. Better then most trays with a similar price point.",
