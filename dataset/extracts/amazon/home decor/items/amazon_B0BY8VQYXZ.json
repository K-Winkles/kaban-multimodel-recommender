Please ensure that the power adapter you are using supports DC 5V output to effectively charge the product. 9V or 12V charger is not compatible. Fast charging is not supported.The magnetic force on the stainless steel surface is not sufficient. You will need to use the provided metal strip for installation. In AUTO mode, please do not put two lights too close together, otherwise it may interfere with the work of one of the sensors. (As motion sensor can only be activated in dark environment, if one light turns on, the environment is too bright for the other one) It is recommended to space them at least one meter apart. If the received package is missing parts or if the motion sensor lights do not work, please let us know via Amazon message, we will make it right for you immediately!",

We've used them in our pantry and under a cabinet - they give good bright light. The light is VERY white - which is great if you want to see something, but might not be ideal if you want a more nuanced illumination for your aesthetic. They charge quickly from USB and the charge lasts a long time. Overall, just a good light for general use and not expensive.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this for above my door frame in my shared apartment foyer so I didn\u2019t have to leave my light on the whole time I\u2019m not home but could still see when I needed to unlock my door. Then I bought 8 more for under my kitchen cabinets and in the hallway leading to my front door/living room. It\u2019s the perfect tone of light and awesome brightness and they shut off on their own after so many seconds so they don\u2019t waste energy and I can just walk around my kitchen/hall without having to turn any lights on. Also bought two extra to keep charged for backup that I can just switch out when they start to die and need recharged. That seems to be working well because I always have working lights. I didn\u2019t have electricity at all for 17 months right before I bought these and would just recharge things at work so these would have definitely worked well for that as charging them really doesn\u2019t take that long and they\u2019re small and attach and reattach with a magnet so they\u2019re super easy to swap out and charge. Definitely recommend. Now that I have electricity again I still don\u2019t use the lighting that is permanently installed in my apartment and these light my kitchen/hallway/and foyer fine. Sometimes the motion timer will shut off and you have to move around a little again to get them all to light up again but there is an always on option also and not just auto so if you needed them to stay on consistently that\u2019s an option.",

I will say that one of them, in a high traffic area, seems to need a charge every other day. That is the only one of the 8 that I have to behave this way.Some were charged fully out of the box and some needed a charge. No biggie for me.They\u2019re bright and that\u2019s what I need. I have two in closets, a few in the back of electronics racks, a couple under cabinets. All of them provide plenty of light for my needs and are a huge improvement over no lights.The motion detectors seem to function well. I have one, that same one that needs charging a lot, that seems a bit spotty but the rest are very good. It may be that there is too much light in that room during the day.The metal bar that comes with it is thin and very bendable but the adhesive seems highly effective and the thinness of bar is nice once it\u2019s mounted as it is hardly noticeable.So far so great. Might even pick up some more if they stay this price.",

                "reviewText": "These lights first off are affordable. For a 2 Pack, Rechargeable, Motion detecting light set, I feel like it can't be beat! I hung mine in my pantry as the pantry doesn't have a light. I wasnworried the door may cause the light to stay on longer than it should when closing the pantry, but it does not stay on long so I think these should hold charge for a while becsude they shut off pretty quick one they are not needed. I do have mine set to Automatic.Be careful as they will slide pretty easily on the sticky mount, not by themselves, but I was changing the setting from Auto and it slid right on the side, stayed on the magnetic bar, but it was a close call. So put them somewhere you do not have to fool with the setting and let them chill where they are at.The lights are bright as well and do the job. I am satisfied with this purchase.****** Update:November 30, I noticed the light stopped working. I charged the light thinking it died after being hung up for so long, but it did not revocer from its malfunction. No matter how you flip the switch, \"on/auto\" the light comes on for literally a second then goes off. When you click another setting to make it react it does nothing at all. Motion is not being detected, and the light \"on\" doesn't stay on. I'll be sending these back if that's an option. I waited on the review to see if it would fix itself, but its over. The light won't work anymore. You get a good couple of weeks, then nothing. Cheap buy, worked well when it did, but both annoying and useless when it doesn't. I now have a light that won't light, and the rechargeable factor is void if there's nothing to light. What am I recharging hope?",
