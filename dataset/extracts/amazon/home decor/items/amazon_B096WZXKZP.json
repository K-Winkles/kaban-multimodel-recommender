                "reviewText": "I recently installed the Govee Flow Plus Light Bars behind my TV and have been very impressed with them so far. The LED lights are super bright and provide a nice glow behind the TV, making colors pop off the screen. Setting them up was a breeze thanks to the very strong adhesive on the light bar mounts. I attached them to the back of my TV in just a couple minutes without any issues.Controlling the lights with the Govee app is simple and intuitive. There are tons of great lighting modes to choose from to match whatever I'm watching or playing on the TV. I also like that I can use Alexa voice controls to change the lights or dim them, all hands-free. Syncing the lights to music is a really cool feature that makes listening to songs that much more immersive.For the price, these smart LED light bars can't be beat. They've definitely enhanced my home entertainment experience. The only small downside is that the adhesive is so sticky, moving the mounts later on could be difficult if I ever need to reposition them. But for now, they work flawlessly mounted right behind my TV. I'd definitely recommend the Govee Flow Plus Light Bars to anyone looking to add ambient lighting to their setup!",

                "reviewText": "First impression. Blinding. I turned them on and these lights nearly burned my retinas right off. Easy connection to the app and me personally to the Alexa app as well. Comes with two different types of stands, I mounted mine on the back of my computer monitors, and they are STUCK. The adhesive that are on the mounts are wonderful. I have my lights set to a solid color, but they can also be mounted to TVs and can change the color scheme related to music, movies, etc. When I wanted RBG lights I immediately thought of a Phillips color hue lamp/light bar, but they're too proud of their products. I went with a 'cheaper' option, but it definitely didn't impact the quality. These are quality lights, and totally complete my computer set-up. I got exactly what I wanted in these lights and I could not be happier. I will 100% be purchasing Govee lights the next time I want to \"light\" up my life.",

                "reviewText": "I chose this product beacuse I have know the brand for a while and I know that their devices are made with a good quality. I used these lights as a night light on my bedroom since an old led strip had just finished its useful life. This was a considerable upgrade over that led strip.The device came in a neat box by Govee, it was well organized and devided into separate sections the lights, the two cables and two mounts. There were two cables, one that conects the light to the control and another that conects the power to the control. There were provided two mounts, one for placing upright on some type of flat surface and another one with two sided 3m branded tape which can be used to mount the lights to vertical surfaces.The setup was quite easy as I had already the Govee app and I just had to search for the devices wifi and connect to it and open the app and insert some info about the local wifi. Thats the set up. Probably finished the set up in less than three minutes.The lights are really cutomizable, as with both combined you can show up to 12 different colors using both lights (six colors per light). The app has some useful features as changing the different colors and sections that will light up. You can costumize a timer, brightness and how the light will change with a beat of the music.Integrating the lights to Alexa or google is relatively simple. With both assistants, they can change the brightness, color, music color changing modes and you can even pair the Alexa so that it will gradually turn on the lights brightness before the alarm goes of in the morning.Overall, great light and under the normal lighting (bright white, warm white and mixed) they are really bright. However, bear in mind that with the colors the brightness will vary.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Govee Smart LED Light Bars, and they've added a fun and vibrant atmosphere to my space. These light bars are incredibly easy to install, offer impressive brightness, and provide a wide array of colors to choose from. However, the absence of a dedicated app control is a bit of a downside.Installation was a breeze. I appreciate that Govee included all the necessary mounting hardware, making it a hassle-free process. It took me less than 10 minutes to have the light bars set up under my cabinets, giving my kitchen an instant upgrade. The adhesive backing is strong, ensuring the lights stay securely in place.When it comes to brightness, these LED light bars do not disappoint. They provide ample illumination, making them perfect for task lighting, accentuating decor, or setting the mood for different occasions.However, my only gripe with the Govee Smart LED Light Bars is the lack of a dedicated app for control. While they can be voice-controlled with Alexa and Google Assistant, I found myself wishing for a smartphone app to fine-tune settings and schedules. It would be more convenient to have the option to adjust the lights remotely or set up automated routines.",

The app allows so much customization, your mind is the limit on what you can do.

                "reviewText": "This product is amazing. Its essentially a cheaper Philips hue bar. The only thing that could be a little better is if it was brighter, but to be honest its plenty bright enough. I believe you will be very happy with this purchase. Although my box did arrived damage and the delivery driver threw my package on my porch, luckily, nothing was damaged, at least I don't think. All in all, this is a great product for anyone wanting to add some flair to their room!",
