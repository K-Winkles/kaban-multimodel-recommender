It reminds me of the old days it\u2019s a bit of a steam punk feel to it!I don\u2019t know about the other candles, but this natural candle smells sweet, like honey, a very pleasant fragrance.I almost didn\u2019t buy it because of the negative reviews about how the candle was breaking on everyone and mine arrived and sat on my porch for hours in winter with freezing temperatures, and I just knew if I tried to bend it to place it where it needs to burn that it would break so I got a hairdryer out and warmed it up and it works perfectly! I LOVE it!!!",

                "reviewText": "I am BEYOND happy with this candle set.1st of all, the packaging was excellent. See the pictures. Well wrapped and protected gave me a sense of comfort that the product was probably also made with care. Instructions for use was great.2nd, it is sooooo pretty! It also smells amazing It! You can actually detect the scent of honey when you unwrap it and it burns. It isn't a lot. Just a hint every so often which was an unexpected nice surprise. It also has a candle in it already so you just unwrap and use straight out of the box.3rd It is lightweight so would use caution if small children are around table tops.4th We have burned it 2x and it works like a charm. I ordered 2 so I could keep one and 2nd is gift for my daughter and son in law. Also purchased the refills. PROBLEM is I ordered the wrong refills (regular candle not Citronella which we both need in Miami given that mosquitos here are large enough to carry a small dog!) The candle set is correct 80 Hour Citronella candle yet i ordered the wrong refills. I am NOT returning the replacements i bought incorrectly. Yes, it's that beautifulConclusion......you HAVE to order this elegant piece. It will look beautiful as an outdoor tabletop centerpiece or wherever you place it outdoors, is functional, burns clean without soot in the air or on the glass or messy dripping wax, works as stated, and will absolutely \ud83d\udcaf be a conversation starter.Just be careful when clicking the refill to scroll to Citronella refill. I just realized that upon opening the refills.Side noteI did need to use additional mosquito Repellent so it's not as much as a barrier as other products yet I would absolutely recommend it. It's that pretty and unique.",
