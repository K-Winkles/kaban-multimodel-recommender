These ones are ceramic with a cork on the bottom. I feel like either side of the coaster absorbs, although you'd want to use it cork side down to protect your table. I attached a picture for reference with my cup on it (my cup that doesn't sweat lol). I LOVE how neutral these are. the stone color actually matches my fireplace, since I put them on my coffee table in my family room. I also love the simple black holder they come in. The only reason I took off one star is because there's no variation in the pattern. It's not a deal breaker, just something I would prefer for a more natural look. Overall, great, aesthetically pleasing coaster!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this as a gift for my daughter but I like them myself. Usually you only get 4 coasters per set, but with this set, you get 6, which is better. I have to have 2 sets of 4 coasters in my living room when my family comes to visit, which has 5 people. These coasters also come with a sturdy metal holder. The coasters will go with many decors, as the primary color is white. What is also amazing is the way they are packaged. There are pieces of cardboard between each coaster and packing around the circumference. Then you put the coasters in the holder, which goes into another inner cardboard box, then into the outer box. They are packed so carefully, it is extremely unlikely they would get damaged during shipment. Unfortunately, I think I am going to return them because I found another more practical gift to get instead.The primary colors in our living room are beige and browns, but we do have orange ceramic lamps, a red wall picture frame in the room, a red remote holder and 2 other picture frames that have green matting. So, one set of our current coasters are red and orange and green, which pulls the colors of our room together nicely. If I didn't have those, I would definitely keep these coasters, since they are very nice. I wish these coasters had more colors in them that were in our room.",
