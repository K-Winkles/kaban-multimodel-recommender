                "reviewText": "I always have candles on hand in case of emergency. I had these for a while before I needed them in a power outage. They are well-made, and the wick is sturdy. They're scentless which is good for my household. The burn time for us was about 3 1/2 hours. In the end, we didn't have to use many of them. 50 lights at this price is a deal, especially with the good burn time of each tea light.",

                "reviewText": "I am pleased to report that each tealight was intact.. So often, I receive some tea lights that have been crushed, dented, or otherwise damaged.I tested these tea lights in a variety of situations and rooms (because otherwise imperceptible drafts can decrease the life of a tea light. I tried placing them in a safe place by themselves as well as in votives and other tea-light holders. In all cases, these lights performed very well and lasted the stated 4 hours (give or take a few minutes).I have nothing negative to say about these and would happily recommend them to others.Hope this helps!",

If you order, watch your shipment, I never received the notice that it was shipping, just found on my driveway.",
