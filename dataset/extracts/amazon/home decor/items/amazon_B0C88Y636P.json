I rarely take the time to review things but I was really impressed with this rug. typically when I buy something really cheap on amazon I expect it to be cheaply made. This rug is well made and durable. Definitely buy this. Scream was one of the first horror movies I ever saw and this rug takes me back. 11/10 would def buy this again or for a friend.",
