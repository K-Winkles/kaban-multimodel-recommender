Over all it is built pretty well. The coasters themselves feel substantial. The tonearm is made of plastic so you can't be too rough with it. You need to gently turn that to the side to get the coasters off. I would recommend this coaster set to anyone looking for a fun coaster set and especially for those vinyl lovers in your life.",
