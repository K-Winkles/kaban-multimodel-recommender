It melts the candle and you can smell it without burning it. My teenager loves burning candles but this is a safer option and the candles last way longer than if you were burning them.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I love candles but I\u2019m a bit afraid to keep the fire on so I bought this for my bedtime. Then I realized that I couldn\u2019t sleep with lights on so I decided to use it in the living room, which turned out perfect.I thought it wouldn\u2019t work in our big living room at first, but it does! The scent is perfect. It also works as a lamp so it makes the room feel cozy at night.This product is smaller than a usual lamp, but if you turn it high, it\u2019s way brighter than a normal one we all have at home. You can choose the brightness you like and adjust the heat depending on how much you want to melt your candle.I love the gold and a bit of retro style, which fits perfectly with my home. I couldn\u2019t give a 5 star because the glass part is leaning towards the candle and wouldn\u2019t stand straight.The price was affordable than the other products on Amazon and the reviews were good, so I had to go for this. I truly recommend this candle warmer for yourself or for a gift.",

Beautiful and elegant look. Perfect gift!",

Provides a nice warm light to brighten a dark corner in my living room, and the timer feature means it will turn off on its own if I forget. I also have one in my office, and use the timer to signal the end of a work/study session.Also, love the fact that you don\u2019t have to \u201cburn\u201d until the whole surface is liquid to avoid an uneven layer later. This warms it up evenly each time, so you avoid the whole wrap-around tinfoil business.",
