                "reviewText": "In some ways you might expect, and in other ways you might not, this style of coaster (cotton or other similar fabric in a wrapped/pressed disc) is the best type of coaster you can buy. Let's make a list:- They're absorbent. Condensation or spills get soaked up and dry naturally via evaporation.- They don't stick to your cup. Because the surface is naturally \"rough\" and never soaking wet, they don't stick to cups.- They're insulative. Maybe one you didn't think of. Consider what you wear when it's cold; Some thick clothes? This is that, for the bottom of your cup. It insulates it from the heat-sink that is your table, keeping your drink colder/hotter for longer regardless of the type of glass (not going to compete with/do anything for vacuum insulated bottles though).- They're soft. Drop them on something or on your toe, nothing is going to happen.- They're soft (again). They make as little noise as possible when someone rowdy plops a drink down on them with some gusto.- They're renewable. Made from cloth - pretty renewable and sustainable material.- They're cheap. No description required.- They're kinda trendy and kinda homey. Best of both worlds. Other styles are probably available elsewhere though.And maybe more. I was looking at some of those trendy \"diatomaceous\" stone-type products at first (the ones they say soak up and evaporate water quickly). Don't get me wrong, they look fun, but I'm so glad I didn't go with those. Honestly, every time I go to anyone else's house and they have coasters that aren't made of a similar cloth structure, I will be silently judging them. They could have had the best coasters ever for probably less than what they paid for the ones they have. Nothing was in their way, but they chose inferior coasters. How pitiful.Don't be pitiful. Be smart. Buy coasters like these.",

                "reviewText": "Love these! They are stylish, work very well and don't stick to your drink when you pick it up. They stay dry and come in an unobtrusive and simple holder. We liked them so much that I bought another set to put on the dining room table. Very happy with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "They're inexpensive and they do the job. They're cute, but sizes are a tiny bit uneven, not one of them is exactly the same size as another, but not that big of a deal between the biggest one and smallest one there is probably only a quarter inch difference. How well they're held together and how smoothly the end tapers into the circle also differs, but hey, they're coasters and it almost gives them a home made feel. They work and we like them, but you get what you pay for.",
