The wood is slightly rough to the touch, but not splintery like some other Paulownia wood items I've ordered. It feels like it was buffed with a medium grit sandpaper, so you get that rustic look and feel, but not the splinters. There is no stain or wax treatment, just raw unfinished wood that welcomes you to run your hands over it. I think this would make a great gift, especially if used as the base of a gift \"basket\". I originally intended to gift this one, but it's staying with me!",

It's evidently a near-perfect match for another set of decorative bowls she has from a name-brand home decor store, and she's using it as a complimenting piece for various needs. The latest use is as a coffee pod bowl for visiting company, but I'm sure as soon as they've left it'll become a key bowl by the front door, or a fruit bowl on the counter.It's about 12\" across, rough finished and rustic.",

                "reviewText": "The finish of this bowl is super smooth and it doesn't smell like anything toxic. I love how spacious it is as well. You could use it for a variety of things but I'm personally using it to hold miscellaneous things when I first enter my home. I highly recommend this product if your looking for a cute modern looking bowl that doesn't smell like treated wood or anything at all really.",
