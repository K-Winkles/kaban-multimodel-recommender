                "reviewText": "Alright, so, the keyboard feels a lot more solid than the mouse. Its not to say that the mouse sucks, it just feels a bit \"plastichy\"? So far it has held up really well though, so it may just be the feel of it. As I mentioned, the KB is a lot more solid. The keys feel nice to the touch, the colors are great, but lack customization for those that would like to customize it. Yes, the KB has a special key, FN, that when pressed along with \"Esc\", will toggle between three modes of lights. You cannot change the layout of the lights on the KB, just the brightness. It goes from bright, dim, blinking, to off. After a while of no use, the KB will go on standby and shut off until a key is pressed. This does not happen with the mouse. The mouse cycles between 4 colors. Red, Purple, Blue, and Pinkish Purple. As far as I know, and I did try, you cannot make a color on the mouse static. It will always cycle between these 4 colors. You can however, turn off the lights on the mouse by holding down the button on the top of the mouse. If you simply click the button, it will change the DPI settings for the mouse which it has 4 different speeds for it.Recently had a scare with the KB. I usually turn off the KB lights during the day, and turn them on at night. When i did this last time, the lights wouldn't turn back on no matter how many times i pressed FN + Esc. I thought I was missing the keys since I was in the dark. Initially I thought damn, its broken now.. But doing a restart on the PC made it turn back on. Since then, I'm kind of scared turning the KB off again.The base of the KB is some kind of metal. It has a cellphone holder \"feature\" that I haven't used, mostly because my KB sits under the desk thus the phone will not fit. But the Idea of having an expensive phone rest on some kind of metal deters me from using it.Price 5/5Responsiveness 5/5Aesthetic 5/5Feel 4/5Good purchase so far.",

                "reviewText": "I got this keyboard and mouse combo for my daughter who loves fun and spunk things to show her personality. It uses a single USB receiver, which can be found inside the mouse battery compartment, to connect both the keyboard and mouse to a computer. My daughter prefers this 2.4GHz USB receiver rather than Bluetooth because there's no lag with 2.4GHz USB receiver. I was surprised that keyboard only uses 1 AA battery, which is included, but that's because keyboard goes to sleep after few minutes of inactivity to conserve the battery life but it wakes up immediately when you press any key or button on the mouse.The keys on the keyboard are round, which is very unconventional but my daughter finds it fun to type on these and they are very responsive but more than anything, she loves the design and color pattern. Works well without any problem as you would expect from any keyboard or mouse but it certainly screams fun and character to your desk. 5 out of 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "(UPDATE) I bought this keyboard about 4 months ago. The color on the keys has begun to wear, and the space bar has stopped working properly. It now makes an annoying broken clicky noise every time I use it. Disappointing, because the reviews were pretty good.I use this keyboard consistently (about 6-8 hours daily) and after about a month, the paint on the keys started to wear. I didn't care much about color anyway, so it's not a big deal for me, but to those into the aesthetic of it, know that it won't last with moderately heavy daily use.It is comfortable though, and I love the sound it makes. If it freezes up on you when you try to wake it up, just unplug and plug back in the USB.",

Plugged the USB dangle on an empty port on your computer and put a AA battery in the slots of the keyboard and mouse and everything worked without any further action on my part.The keyboard has a really nice vintage design, very unique round keys, also very quiet and not sticky at all, the battery lasts long time, been using them since day one when I received them.Great affordable keyboard and mouse combo for work from home or just replace your old ones that stop working. Does the job go me. Recommended.",
