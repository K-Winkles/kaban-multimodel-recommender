I'm glad I did. This is definitely wood with a laminate on top which is fine, the magnets are cute and hold well the greenery is plastic just what you'd expect and if I had a complaint at all it would be the bow. The bow is potato sack material and lies flat I inserted very thin wire through the material to fluff it up and that worked to an extent but overall this is a nice decoration for indoors. Outdoors is another story like anything else the weather is merciless so for me not recommended to use out doors",

The letters H, M, E are not lined up. When I put the seasonal decoration in the middle to make the O, it looks okay. These are interchangeable with a magnet which works fine. Would I purchase this again or for someone else? No. But I kept it because it looks okay in the space where I hung it.",
