They are smooth, but not as polished as marble. I had to stick them to the glass wall instead.The sticker is strong once it is applied, and it can hold several large bottles of shampoo, conditioner and body wash.They look good and help me keep my bottles organized!",

Sometimes shower caddies can be too narrow for certain hair and body products. Not these! They are deep enough to hold all sizes of bath products.I love that Thai set came with different size and function pieces. This makes for so many options to install and use. The installation was super easy, and even came with an extra strip of adhesive hooks. I was able to lift and reposition the adhesive with ease, but the adhesive remains strong once \u201ccured\u201d for 48 hours.The materials are of good quality, not at all flimsy like others I\u2019ve used. I had 2 leftover pieces I will use in my kitchen A that\u2019s how much I like the look of them. I tend to keep a LOT of product in my bathroom. There are so many pieces this would be great for roommates or souses to keep their things organized and separated. Or you could easily accommodate 2 bathrooms if you aren\u2019t a product addict like I am. I highly recommend this set!",

                "reviewText": "I just did a steam room upgrade for my master bathroom shower so I've been trying out a number of different storage solutions. The various suction cup units have worked pretty great over the last month, but I just don't love the way they look. When I saw these I found myself being a little dubious whether they'd work or not, but decided to give it a shot given how they've illustrated the strength of their adhesive using bricks.I followed the instructions to install these onto the glass window in my steam room and they've now been up for more than 24 hours and I'm really happy with how they look. We are using two of the long ones for various shampoos and other bottles, the tall one for my razor and toothbrush, a soap dish one as a soap dish and then the other soap dish one to hold the various attachments and blades that go on to my razor. I will remain dubious about how well the adhesive will work in the long term, but I will be sure to come back and update this review if I have anything come crashing down anytime soon.",

The instructions recommend waiting 24 hours before placing any weight within the caddy. Unfortunately, I missed that detail, and it performed perfectly! It's not often you get a beautifully made product that performs well AND is easy to install. If you are looking for a shower caddy set adds beauty to your bathroom, you have found it! No more of those unsightly silicone suction cups to clean around either!",
