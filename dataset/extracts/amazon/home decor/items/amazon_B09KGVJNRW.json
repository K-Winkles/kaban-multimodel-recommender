Mind you, I also prepped these 96 dead grass pieces by letting them aerate in the sun for hours and then carefully fluffing and lightly spraying them with hairspray to reduce shedding indoors. It was super time consuming and therapeutic. Golly!While I don't believe they are as fluffy as the sample picture, I do think they turned out swell. What wonderful and meticulously planned boho decor. $10? What a steal!Buy them now!",
