                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I wanted to add some backlight to my tv and for some reason the 100 ft lights were cheaper than the other lights with less footage. I saw lots of reviews complaining about the length and I honestly didn\u2019t have any other need for these, so I looked up how to cut them and it was very easy. You have to cut right in the middle of the 4 connectors (see photo for reference). This is where the circuits are closed, so this will not damage any other lights if done correctly. I\u2019m glad It worked out and I\u2019m still able to use the remaining lights if I want to reconnect them. The remote has a weak signal, but it\u2019s cheap so I didn\u2019t expect anything fancy. I\u2019ll try the app and see if it works a little better but for now, my lights are doing what they\u2019re supposed to, no issues.",

Im a picky shopper and im always worried about how im spending my money even if its a gift card but these were 100% worth it. Theres an app that connects to them so you can control the colour even while being in a different room. Im buying a 2nd package of the same LED lights for my other room. 10/10!!",

The brightness of the lights is great, and they look very pretty. The remote control did come basically broken. When I got the lights, I used the remote twice to test it and when I went to finally set it on a color, it did not work. There is an app that you can download though which is what I use, and it works great, and it is really simple. Great lights overall just wished the remote actually worked.",

Unfortunately, they only lasted a week because one of the boys bumped the plug and it shorted out the entire strip rendering it all useless. So this is my third purchase(second purchase was because I needed more lights!) And I'm hoping these last a lot longer because redoing a cloud ceiling is not a good time.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I am a college student and I got these lights for my new suite this year. I put them up just yesterday and they were working perfectly and all uniform. Although, at some point last night one small section of the LED strip turned a completely different color than what I set the lights to (as seen in the photo and video), and I still have not figured out how to fix it, but it does not bug me personally as it might for others.I also turned off the lights last night before bed and today when I went to turn them on they wouldn\u2019t work\u2026BUT I looked at the questions asked on Amazon for this product concerning the lights not turning on and many people said you just have to flip the plug in the wall outlet around. (Ex: if you initially have it plugged in and the small end is sticking out to the left, flip it so the small end is towards the right).Overall, it\u2019s a good product I would say, but not the most elite lights. You get what you paid for essentially (as in these lights were pretty cheap so I figured they might have some quirks). I hope this helps future consumers!",
