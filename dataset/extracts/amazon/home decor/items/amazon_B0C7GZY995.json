However, it wasn\u2019t giftable since some of the oil had somehow leaked and gotten all over the bottle and its packaging. It wasn\u2019t a significant leak since when I looked at the remaining amount in the bottle it seemed to still be pretty close to full. But regardless, it was still enough to coat the entire outside of the bottle. I cleaned it up and just kept it for myself as a result.",

I chose the refund and within an hour it was done along with a promise to look into why the smell was so strong. Huge shout out to this seller for wanting to make it right. That doesn't happen often anymore. Thank YOU!Super cute item but the smell is horrific. It smells like chemicals. I would have loved to send it back for a refund but it made my house smell so bad all I could focus on was getting it OUT. Threw it in my outside trashcan and the smell wandered into my garage and lasted for several days. I am usually ok with scents but this one was BAD.",

The sleek appearance blends seamlessly with my home decor, enhancing the ambiance effortlessly. Additionally, I appreciate that it doesn't take up much space, making it easy to place on a shelf or countertop without crowding the area.One notable aspect of this diffuser is its effectiveness in spreading fragrance throughout the room. I found that only three sticks were needed to fill my apartment space with a pleasant scent. However, I did notice that using more sticks could lead to an overpowering aroma, so it's best to start with a conservative number and adjust based on personal preference. Nonetheless, the diffuser efficiently creates a welcoming atmosphere, making it ideal for everyday use.Upon arrival, I did encounter a minor issue with the diffuser being a bit oily. However, it was a simple fix \u2013 a quick wipe with a paper towel removed the excess oil without any hassle. While this initial hiccup was a slight inconvenience, it didn't detract from the overall satisfaction I've had with the diffuser's performance. Overall, it's a stylish and practical addition to my home that I'm happy to have.",

                "reviewText": "I took a chance on this, typically I have to physically smell the product and not go by the name itself. This one was pleasantly surprising! The scent is strong at first but then after a little while it becomes more subtle. I chose to place mine in our main downstairs bathroom. The bottle and reeds make for a nice display and the scent works nicely with the bathroom. It does not cover toilet smells entirely but it does keep the scent of bowels from wafting out into the hallway.There is quite a bit of product in the bottle so I imagine the usage goes on for a while. I'm 3 weeks in and not even at the halfway point. I flip my reeds every so often to keep the scent flowing. The product is a bit pricey but everything included is of good quality and given the longevity of the fragrance, it probably works out to be cheaper than continuously buying air fresheners. I should add that the fragrance is a nice natural one, not chemically or artificially-smelling. Additionally, being in the same room as the fragrance is not overpowering and doesn't make you choke. It's quite nice and I look forward to trying out scents from this company!",

It\u2019s absolutely beautiful and I can\u2019t imagine anyone finding the smell offensive. The projection on this is decent, it is an oil diffuser, so it\u2019s not meant to sent a large area, but it does a good job in the relatively small area where I placed it.I went with the lavender scent, and it\u2019s a really beautiful interpretation.

The reeds are very nice quality and nice and thick which is why this item projects the scent so well. The stem bouquet contains real lavender that has been dried, and be aware that the lavender does lose seeds if not handled very gently. There are also several stems of dried eucalyptus, which I enjoyed so much taking out of the package because they have such a wonderful aroma. There are also a couple of other fluffy stems, which I don\u2019t know the name of.I absolutely love this, it looks expensive. It smells expensive and it\u2019s a pleasure to have in my house. I will re-order this for myself, as well as for gifts in the future.",

It's beautiful and a perfect addition to make your home smell and look good. The Santa vanilla musk is strong so I only put 3 of the 6 sticks in. This is just my preference. I would have given this a 5/5 but I would suggest to the company that they package their bottles a bit better. The box looked fine on the outside but when I opened it the bottle only had a thin plastic wrapping on the top of it, which had clearly leaked. Luckily not too much but enough that some got on the label and stained it, as you can see in the picture. I don't personally care, but would be disappointed if I was gifting this. Otherwise a solid product.",
