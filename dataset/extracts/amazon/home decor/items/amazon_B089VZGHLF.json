                "reviewText": "This is a nice mini kit that has a lot of garden options (e.g., 2 moss mounds, 3 stones, 1 pagoda, 1 bridge, 2 trees, a packet of pebbles, 6 sand rakes, and 1 lotus flower, whereas a lot of other kits just provide 2 or 3 of those items). The lotus flower in my kit had two of its petals broken off, but I didn't mind re-attaching them with super glue. The \"wood chip\" platform upon which each tree is supposed to stand is like balsa wood, so one of mine broke in half when I tried to connect it to the tree, but it was easy to reattach with a little bit of super glue and a small piece of painter's tape on the bottom. The kit came with a thank you card from the seller that stated if something was missing or damaged, the seller would promptly replace the missing or damaged item, so you do have that option if you don't want to fix a minor break in one of the items. The bag of sand is generous. I didn't need to empty out the entire bag of sand to fill up the tray. The kit also comes with an accordion-like information card that briefly describes the significance of each garden item (e.g., the moss mounds, etc.). I'm glad I got this for myself. It would also make a nice gift.",
