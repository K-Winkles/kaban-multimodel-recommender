I assumed by the price it may be lightweight, thin, and cheaply made but it\u2019s not! It actually has a little weight to it. I have seen similar blankets in cabin and outdoor home stores going for over $100! Don\u2019t let the small box fool you when it arrives\u2026 This faux fur blanket will surprise you! It will create memories at the cabin, make romantic nights more special, winter sleigh rides lots of fun, and even makes a thoughtful and lovely gift! I love it so much I\u2019m going to buy more!!",

Yes, it is not \"Perfect\" or Incredibly high quality materials you can get for premium prices but it is incredibly warm and has decent weight to it as well! Not too thick and not too thin neither. Bought the Throw size Blanket as an extra blanket to have for my Fiance to use when she gets a little too chilly from the AC or a Winter Night (I am Warm Blooded Lol!) Will definetly buy this again in the near future.",

However now I'm about to purchase my second one because the grandkids cannot stop fighting over this blanket. It is so so soft that everyone wants to wrap themselves in it. And I just love that the softness is on both sides not just one as it is on so many other blankets like this.",
