                "reviewText": "Unfortunately, my shower only has one small storage area in it for shower items. We definitely needed more storage space. The other shower caddies I used had suction cups\u2026they were always falling off the wall. So I decided to try out this caddy system.These caddies were so easy to put on the tile. The mounting system is very easy to apply. You can even slide the caddies off of the mount so you can clean/rinse off the caddies themselves. These definitely stay on the wall and aren\u2019t going anywhere soon. The larger caddy has easily been holding two huge Costco-size bottles of shampoo and conditioner. Overall this caddy system keeps my shower nice and organized. It is so nice to not have all of my wife\u2019s shower stuff sitting all over the ledge of the shower.I have been using these in my shower for quite some time and they are truly rust free. Overall I am very pleased with these shower caddies and the black matte color looks great too. I would definitely recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "I have tried shower caddies that are held up on the wall by suction cups, and they have always ended up losing suction, falling off, and disappointing me. So I ended up getting one that stands in the corner. While it was a little annoying because it was slightly off-balance (my shower floor is probably not completely flat), I still used it for over 5 years. But it has been looking worse for wear lately. And then I got a shower brush a few weeks ago and that came with a hook that was on a really sticky sticker for the shower wall. Which got me thinking...Someone I know ended up recommending this particular one to me. I really liked that this product includes 5 pieces and that they are rust-proof, can hold up to 12 lbs, and seem very easy to install. I was so excited when I finally received the product and immediately went to put up the stickers. The stickers seem really strong and I followed instructions to leave them on the wall for 24 hours before attaching the shelves to them. There are 4 variously-sized pieces, with 2 of the smallest piece. The variety in sizes/types actually worked really well for me and the items I wanted to keep in my shower.While I have had them up for less than a week, I am very happy with these shelves. I will come back to update my review if they end up disappointing me, but I am very optimistic about these lasting for a long time.",
