It's like Christmas every day when my orders arrive. But this one exceeded my hopes and vision! My passion for elephants is beyond words. I opened the package with all the excitement of a child at Christmas. There it was, a gift that brought tears of joy to my eyes! This is a true work of elephant artisty! I didn't display it as pictured. I opted to sit the elephant on the tray so it would be on full display. The tray provided a glorious visual contrast between the silvery elephant and the gold tray. I added a flaming amber tea light candle that added a firey glowing ambiance! Pure joy is my short, sweet description for this work of joyous elephant artistry! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
