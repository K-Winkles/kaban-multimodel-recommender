And when they start to break there is no fixing them unless you want to use a bunch of duck tape. These are sturdy. They are lined so no wetness leaks through. They fold easily for storage. I keep one in my bath room to use as a hamper but the other two only get used on laundry day. They hold quite a bit and look nice, too. I'm really happy with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "These are great. They probably won't last forever, but they are much more durable than I expected and have strongly attached straps. I live in a 3 story house with the bedrooms at the top and laundry at the bottom, and I tend to overload laundry bins. So I've eventually had the straps/ handles break on every laundry basket I've ever owned, and recently decided to try a new strategy of buying lots of cheap bins instead of a few more expensive bins. These have held for 3 months so far, and I feel that I've already gotten my money's worth.I also really like my new set up of having more bins than I need. These are so cheap and fold up when not in use, so I can always keep an empty one nearby, and then I never have the problem of clothes piling up on the floor while I'm in the process of doing laundry.",
