Negatives? it is quite thin. The fabric feels weird, like the first time i stepped on it barefoot, I thought I had stepped on my little dog and almost did a back flip! When i stepped on it with socks, I slipped. It wasn't the grip on the bottom at fault, it was the softness and odd texture of the fabric. Be careful! I thought about tossing it in the washer to see if that would get rid of the slippery texture, but it says to spot wash only, so I guess I won't.",

I have a queen size bed frame and the 5x7 rug aligns perfectly in my bedroom without taking too much space or getting in the way. it is also thin enough so that my gaming chair doesn't get caught on it when i move it which was a big concern. the material is really soft and is addicting to lay on, comfortable for an adult. the only problem i had is that it has a really strong chemical smell upon me opening it but i managed to alleviate it with a couple of sprays of lavender febreze.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Ophanie Living Room Rug in the 5x8 Grey size and found it to be a mix of positives and negatives. On the upside, the rug's comfort is undeniable. Its ultra-soft, shaggy surface and high-density sponge interlayer provide a cozy and pleasant feel underfoot, making it ideal for rooms where comfort is key, like living rooms or nurseries.However, the rug falls short in durability, particularly with the non-slip pad at the bottom. Despite its initial effectiveness, the pad wears out quickly, leading to the rug bunching up, which can be a hassle to constantly adjust. Given its affordable price, I would still recommend this rug for those looking for comfort on a budget, but be aware of the potential longevity issues.Overall, I'd rate the Ophanie Living Room Rug 3 stars. It excels in providing a cozy feel to any room but may require additional maintenance or even a replacement pad over time due to wear and tear.",

                "reviewText": "I have 2 large dogs and a muddy yard so I needed a rug thats easy to clean and cushioned enough for the dogs and occasionally toddlers. But I got tired of spending $150+ every few months for a new rug and pad. Yes I've tried carpet cleaners but just doesn't get clean enough for me.This rug (6x9) is easy to shake out. It vacuums well. I've had large and small accidents so far, small urine spot, then mystery liquid accident prior to my dog having her puppies. I just scrubbed the faux fur with a wet sponge and dawn, soaked up the soapy water with paper towels, sprayed with Lysol, fluffed the fur back up and let it dry. Looked totally normal once dry and no smell.This rug has a little cushion, not much, but enough to not feel like you're sitting on bare floor. It has a skid resistant backing which works fine. If the dogs are playing aggressively then it gets ruffled up but not a big deal. The backing keeps the liquid from spills from getting to the floor. Anytime I've had an accident you could not even see the liquid outline on the pad underneath. And tbh I didn't always know when they happened.I'm very happy with the purchase overall. Got a smaller rug for my son's room for a Christmas present and he loves it. Only negative thing I can really say is the color of the rug is significantly lighter than the one shown online. My house is not the pinnacle of interior design so I didn't mind. However, I do wish I could get the actual color pictured because the darker color would mask dirt better but the ease of cleaning makes me clean it more often, which is a great thing all around. Oh yeah, and these rugs are cheap. Cheap enough that I won't be mad replacing this rug with the same one after my litter of puppies is gone. And the rug for my son's room was only $20, so I can realistically make him pay for a new if he messes his up\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udcaf",
