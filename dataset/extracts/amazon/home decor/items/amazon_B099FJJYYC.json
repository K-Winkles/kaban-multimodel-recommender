I usually have something bigger, but I'm getting used to the size of this one. I think I might get another one to use in front of the vanity too. Two smaller ones instead of one larger one. It's very cute, and looks great in my black, white, gold & grey bathroom. I ultimately love it!",

These mats work though. Stepping out of the shower, these mats are very comfortable and absorbent. They don't take long to dry and they're easy to clean in the washing machine.After it was already too late, I went shopping at Walmart and 1 mat that is the size of 3 of these mats but the price of 2. So since I already bought 2 of these, if I would have went to Walmart first, I could have spent the same amount of money to get the size matt that actually makes sense for an adult",

It does not whether it does not strip it does not fold. It does not get bumpy. This is definitely what you wanna buy if you wanna be able to wash and dry something Every other day because I have dogs so dog food gets into my bathroom sometimes and I don\u2019t want it on my bathmat, so I\u2019ll wash it along with my daily shower towels and it comes out fine. It doesn\u2019t get lumpy and bumpy or chair open so I would recommend this out of all the bathmats that they have on Amazon. I like this one, the best , and it\u2019s really squishy on your feet. It\u2019s really comfortable it does feel like memory foam. I\u2019m not sure if it is but it feels like it gives your heels and your toes a break after getting out of the shower after standing for so long.",
