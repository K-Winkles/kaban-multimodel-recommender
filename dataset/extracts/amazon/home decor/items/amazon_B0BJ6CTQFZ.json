I bought this to replace a wax warmer that I cannot find (it was perfect). With that one, the base was still cool, but it melted the wax really well and was comfortable with leaving it on while I wasn\u2019t home. Now, this one on the other hand, the base gets extremely HOT. While it\u2019s good for the wax, I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable or even safe leaving this unattended. I feel like it\u2019s a little too hot and will burn the wax. I just got it so I\u2019ll will keep a close eye on it . Definitely put it in a safe space and keep an eye on it. Might return it just for a peace of mind and get one that\u2019s not so hot!",

The power cord is only about a foot long with a switch on the cord.. Will likely need an extension cord it your moving it in the house... The unit gets fairly hot to touch for both the burner as well as the plate.. Only one amber light on the unit to let you know it is on.. Does not come with a timer or any other type switch.. Wax seems to melt good... Will see how it works out in 3/6 months...",

After a few days of use, I must say it's a great little burner. It has nice deep tray with room for several cubes (I prefer one at a time) with handy push button power lead. It does take a little while to heat up, but if you allow good time, it's no problem. Overall, for the price point, it is stylish and functional, with no need for replacement bulbs. It doesn't get overly hot either, but enough heat to burn the wax. 5*.",
