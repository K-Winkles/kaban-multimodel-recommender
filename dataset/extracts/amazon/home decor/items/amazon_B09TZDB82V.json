                "reviewText": "Began search looking for a led floor lamp. Got hookedon that large curved all in a single row wand. No 'fixture'on its end. Reading many negative Comments steeredme away, even though the design is extremely attractive.Finding this torchiere in the lamp forest was pure luck!!The picture of the top of the O'Bright floor lamp showsthe white led clear plastic side. We'd be lighting up theceiling which you entirely might wish.Other side of slotted disk is flat black like the base rest,and normally seen when the lamp is positioned for use.O'Bright OB-FL01D -- attracted to the dual equallyproportioned disks at base and at top a really innovative,thoroly modern, slotted disk lamp at top of an extremelyslender pole. The nearly 5-star comment rating hereconvioncved me to order ! OK:The first thing to notice is that the heavy base is shippedin the most amazing papiermache sculpture imaginable.Looks like a game of tunnels, towers and trolls, if therewas such a game.It is pretty easy to figure out how it goes together. Fourtubes screw together without a seam, pole looks one piece.Worry about the wire twisting too much inside whilescrewing the four pieces together.I've bought two, the second one, I 'counter-wound' wiresa couple turns before assembling... probably makes nodifference. Really like the minimalist disk design, skinnyblack pole, with the slotted torch centered at the top.You like the design, or don't. It's industrial art, but it'snot, It might even have a personality. At first touch, thenon-switch, no remote, and instant blast of light ismarvelous. Switch is not down at the floor but exactlyat the right height on the column, Touch it again, it dims.third caress turns the lamp into mood lighting. LEDarray at full blast is like daylight suddenly happened,natural, not blue or incandescent yellow. A slender 7'black cord with a simple connect to a short tail comingout of the pole about 2'' above the base, It connects toa tidy black transformer that plugs into the house duplex.Design allows full access to the second socket.Got a couple more...Now, on the fourth lamp. With its 66\" height and 10\" DLED array that at full bore will light up a whole wall, halfa room-- and do it not at table lamp height, not from aceiling light, but at a new 270 degree interactive personheight, which is new in my digs.Consider the lamp almost anonymous, it's a source ratherthan a thing. With its, could be a little longer, cord andeasy weight, pick it up, move it close to a table, behind acouch, point the cool to touch magic disk exactly, and you,on the column, with a gentle how-do-you-do make it goaway -- or blast like a shaft of sunlight thru a window.Everything seems right. It deserves an award. EbbPS: Had a switch go bad, sent a USP return label, newtorchiere arrived almost at the same time I droppedthe return at the store. Like immediate.",

                "reviewText": "I went back and forth trying to decide whether to order black or silver. Decided on silver. Lamp came and was black. Thought I must be remembering it wrong. Finally checked. I did not order it wrong. They sent the wrong color. The order was for silver and they sent me black. Called and they said to use Amazon's return policy but honestly after assembling it, deciding on the slant that would work best for the lamp's top, and getting it situated where I wanted it, that did not seem worth it.And the black does look a lot better than I thought it would.It is bright and it does look attractive in my opinion, but then I like modern style furniture.Assembly ... after the first instruction ... was straight forward. The first instruction tells you to connect the power part but there is no picture that has a power part labelled. My first guess was the power cord that plugs into the wall. Wrong. That is not what they meant. They meant the power cord that connects the bulbs with the pole. Also, they did not say how to connect it. I just connected it. Wrong again. You need to slide the power cord through the separate top part of the pole and then connect it. After figuring out that, the rest of the assembly was straight forward and easy.One last item ... they say the lamp may have a delay if it is connected to a smart device. I did not realize a plug that is controlled by an ordinary wall switch was considered a smart device. I emailed and was told that yes, if you want to connect the lamp to an on/off switch, there will be a delay of from 2 - 3 seconds before the lamp actually turns on and you get light in the room. That can feel pretty weird and does not help you see in the dark. You'll need some other light source in the room that you can use for the 2 - 3 seconds, or stand still waiting until the lamp lights up and you can see where you are going.Hope that helps.",

The remotes are cheap and if you plan on running these in different rooms be ready to have one remote turn them all on from what I can gather. When you sync a remote it will sync to all available lights and control them all. For me it\u2019s not a problem because I only used the remote to set the warmth and brightness. I turn them on via voice through google assistant and they save the last setting which is awesome. I\u2019m happy and hope they don\u2019t start tweaking out like others complained. They are streamlined, sleek lamps and I am super happy with the look and tiny footprint.",
