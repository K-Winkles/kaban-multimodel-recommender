Glassware slides off most of them, or collects condensation which drips when you pick up the glass, or worse, actually cling/ sticks to the glass and then falls off with a plop. My coffee mugs are often too large for many coasters, too. Most of my tables have wood and glass tops which require Something to cushion the contact between glassware and glass tabletops, as well as protect the wood from water/ moisture damage. THESE are excellent. The approximately 4 inch diameter accommodates my large mugs, have a raised edge to collect condensation, don\u2019t stick to my glassware, and Still Look Good Enough to place stemware on. They\u2019re sturdy and washable (don\u2019t put them in the dishwasher as the silicone coasters can warp from the heat/dry cycle), and come in several colors. I\u2019m glad I bought them, I bought red ones, and used them for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.",

These coasters fit mugs and glasses as one would expect in terms of usual size.; however, there is a rim and it wouldn't be wise to set a glass or mug that is too big on top of it, as it would slip off. In that sense, other coasters without rims might be preferred. For regular sized glasses and mugs, I think that the rim is helpful, especially as a guide for placing the beveraged centered on to the coaster. They are not absorbent, but the rim provides some protection from small spills. Silicone isn't absorbent by nature and would not be a good choice if that characteristic were a priority. The silicone is thin. I would prefer a coaster that is thicker, though of the same quality as this set. On the other hand, these coasters don't overwhelm the glass or mug. They look nice and are good to use wiith visitors. I have visited people who use the traditional non-absorbent marble or glass coasters, and I never feel secure putting a glass or mug on them. I think that t heswe would be user-friendly with company and children. I think that they will clean well.",

The fact that they\u2019re silicone, can use for hot or cold beverages, you can put them in the dishwasher, and they look great. The holder they come with is nice as well. Especially great if you have kids, my daughter and dogs used to eat my other ones, these they can\u2019t.",
