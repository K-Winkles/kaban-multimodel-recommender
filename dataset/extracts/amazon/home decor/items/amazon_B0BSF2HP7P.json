I\u2019d needed a vanity rug but didn\u2019t want something as busy as an oriental rug, but I didn\u2019t want a plain one either. The colors are really great, the terra cotta shade is perfect, soft and on point, and the black and creamy white is great too. I didn\u2019t expect the subtle forest green, it\u2019s very subdued but adds a really nice element. Seriously, I couldn\u2019t be happier. Shaggy, but not too shaggy. Stays in place. 10/10",

The color is coral and not pink like a lot of the reviews are saying. These are the best boho Aztec rugs I could find on here that look just like the picture \ud83d\ude0aby the way : first picture is with the lights on no flashSecond pic is with the lights off with a flash.",
