It is soft, easy to shake out, fits nicely, stays in place, and offers many colors and sizes. It is a very nice quality rug. The smell was a bit odd when opening, but faded very quickly. They are wrapped very tightly for shipping. I unwrapped them, hung them up for overnight, and by the next day they were smell-free and ready to lay down on the bathroom floor. I have a large bathroom and purchased three. They were all just right.",

                "reviewText": "With the generally rave reviews I decided to give Yimobra rugs a try. I used the rug for next to the bathtub for a week. Initially when I got it and pulled the back of the rug apart from each side, the sticky backing I wasn't sure what it would do to the vinyl flooring I have. Haven't noticed any residue on the floor which was a good sign. I stepped on it with bare feet when I put it down for the first time. It was soft as claimed and felt nice under my feet EXCEPT I could feel ridges from where the strands must be attached to the backing, the way it's \"woven\" or manufactured I'm guessing. Wasn't that pleasant a feeling and depended on where I placed my feet it was more noticeable in some spots than others. Other thing is it's not exactly square on the sides. Like others have mentioned the corners pull out making it look mishappen. Wasn't a huge deal for me but does catch my eye frequently.First trial was absorbancy. Generally I dry off with a towel in the tub, dry one leg, step on the bathrug and dry the other and then get out. This time I just stepped right out and proceeded to dry myself off. Again I felt the ridges under my feet in the base of the rug below the strands. I checked my feet and yup they were totally dry almost immediately, nice. I think it will be hold up well not sure on laundering as I haven't \"yet\" needed to. We'll see and I'll report back.So the good: It's super soft, doesn't slide around on my vinyl floor, very absorbant, bounces back and doesn't mat down and stay that way, and seems to be high quality. The color is rich and vibrant and it steps it up a notch the overall look of my bathroomThe negatives: Sides not being square and the ridges you feel under your feet when I stand on it. I'm undecided if it's something I'll get used to or not. If it becomes I dread everytime I step out of the shower I might toss it and replace it with something else. One other downside because of the thickness of the rug after I move it to the sink area to stand on when I shave, I have to move it out of the way of the bathroom door because it won't go over top of it.Update 2/24/23:----------------------I'd said I'd report back about how well it holds up in the washer and dryer as well as daily usage. I kept forgetting to take a pic of the backside after I'd washed it. Washing it I set the temp to warm and in the dryer I have it set to normal/regular heat. My dryer doesn't get scorching hot so you may want to set yours to permanent press. When I take it out of the washer it isn't heavy, full of water, or anything. Dries fast in the dryer as well. I'm happy to say that the backing has not pealed, come off, cracked, or even stuck to itself after washing and drying. It looks like it did when I first bought it. The front is still just as fluffy and soft, feel good on the feet. I haven't noticed it moving around on my vinyl flooring either when I step out of the shower. Using my foot I still can't slide it across the bathroom floor and have to move it by hand to the sink area when I brush my teeth after I've showered.",
