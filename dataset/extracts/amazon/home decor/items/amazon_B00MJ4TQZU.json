This one was very sloppy and loose and when I picked it up from the top ring it came open and it almost fell apart on the floor and that would have broken the glass that was inside. JUST BE CAREFUL when you first get it because you may need to make some adjustments to the clasp so it stays closed when you pick it up. This I would say was a flaw from sloppy work when it was made.",
