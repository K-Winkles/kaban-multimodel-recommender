The smell is nice at unboxing but it does not last long. I ended up using mine in the kitchen instead of the bathroom as planned. The sticky hook it came with fell off the wall within minutes so I used a clear thumb tack and wrapped some of the twine around it so it\u2019s not even noticeable. I would recommend unboxing outside or over some craft or newspaper as it is messy with mostly loose lavender. I ended up putting that in a tiny decorative spice bowl and placing on my bathroom counter. Overall I love this piece and do not regret purchasing despite lack of fragrance.",
