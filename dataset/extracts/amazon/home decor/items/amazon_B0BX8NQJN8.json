Still need to adjust some of the branches but the overall look and height 7\u2019 was exactly what I wanted. Came packaged great and just needed some fluffing with any artificial plant. I ordered the concrete planter and black large river rocks to complete the look. You will probably need to put it into something. The tree is pretty top heavy and doesn\u2019t stand good on its own with the pot it\u2019s in. That wasn\u2019t an issue for me since I knew I was putting into a planter. Great buy and looks really good",
