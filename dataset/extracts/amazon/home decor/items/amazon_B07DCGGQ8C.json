                "reviewText": "I am delighted to leave a five-star review for the Coasters for Drinks Absorbent Drink Coaster Set. These coasters have proven to be an excellent addition to my home, and they also make for a fantastic housewarming gift that is both adorable and practical.From the moment I unwrapped these coasters, I was struck by their charming design. The attention to detail is evident, and the cute patterns add a touch of personality to my living space. They're not just coasters; they're decorative accents that enhance the overall aesthetic of any room.The functionality of these coasters is top-notch. The absorbent material does an exceptional job of soaking up any moisture, ensuring that my surfaces remain clean and dry. I particularly appreciate the thoughtfulness in designing them with a heavy weight. This feature prevents the coasters from sticking to the bottom of glasses, mugs, or cups, which can be an annoyance with lighter coasters.The set of six coasters is a generous number, providing ample coverage for guests and family members. I've used them during gatherings, and they've proven to be reliable protectors for my furniture.What truly makes these coasters stand out is their versatility. Not only are they functional for everyday use, but they also serve as a wonderful housewarming or hostess gift. The attractive packaging and quality craftsmanship make them a thoughtful present that anyone would appreciate.Cleaning the coasters is a breeze as well. I've simply rinsed them under water and let them air dry, and they're ready to use again.In conclusion, the Coasters for Drinks Absorbent Drink Coaster Set has exceeded my expectations in terms of both style and performance. They're cute, functional, and well-crafted. If you're seeking a practical way to protect your surfaces while adding a touch of charm to your home, or if you're in need of a delightful housewarming gift, these coasters are an excellent choice. I am thoroughly impressed and would recommend them without hesitation.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely LOVE these coasters! They are elegant looking and hilarious all at the same time. The ceramic is durable and beautiful looking. The cork on the bottom makes the coasters stay in place and not slide around easily. The top seems to be super absorbent as the condensation from a cup I was using normally would have created a small puddle on the table and there was nothing. My family loves the coasters and think they are so funny. I will definitely be buying additional sets as gifts for friends. The customer service from Urban Mosh is superior to any other company I have done business with on Amazon. They personally took the time to check in with me on my order and the condition of my order. The art form of stellar customer has long been forgotten but Urban Mosh seems to understand that a strong business is built by facilitation of amazing partnerships with their customers. Excellent job you guys! Congrats on a great product and outstanding service! Kudos! Highly recommend buying these coasters, they are great!",

Dropped another one couple weeks later and it just cracked in half. Fixed with super glue but looks horrible. Stains will not come out of the coaster. Spilt soda, sauce and other drinks will not come out. They are funny and worth the money.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. These are of a better quality than I expected. They feel nice and sturdy and are larger in diameter than I thought they would be, which is great for coffee mugs or glasses with a wide bottom.They were also packaged very carefully. I wish I had taken a picture before I opened the box, but these coasters would be highly giftable. The box was in perfect condition and each coaster was individually wrapped in a custom sized bubble-wrap sleeve. Packaging can be wasteful in some instances, but in this case the bubble-wrap was necessary to prevent them from chipping or breaking during shipping.I can't speak to their longevity as I just received them, but should the print wear off or if they stain I will change my review accordingly.I would definitely buy these again!",
