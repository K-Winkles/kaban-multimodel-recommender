                "reviewText": "All hooks were in a bulk-like manner placed in the plastic bag - not sure if it is exactly 50 or plus-minus a couple. They are wide, about 1.5 inches, and adhere nicely inside the house to the staircase railing - I wish it would be slightly narrower to fit on the railing without sticking out. I have not tried them outside, so cannot comment on the adhesion and don't know how it will withstand the weather, but have a feeling it should be fine for a relatively smooth surface.The two small hooks on each adhesive plate hold regular Christmas lights wire nicely and securely.",
