That is\u2026\u2026.until I purchased this olive tree! I love it!!! This tree looks so realistic and I get a lot of compliments. It warmed up my space and when I look over in that corner, I smile. Your home should reflect your personality and what you like, not what is the current trend. I need to live in an environment that is calm and flows in an aesthetically pleasing way. My personality is pretty hyper, so low key natural colors help balance me out. lol This tree really complemented my house and warmed up the chosen space enough without overcrowding. This olive tree is well-made, came in a timely manner and was packaged well. Only one olive fell off when I was unpacking it.. the branches were easy to move around and after I found the right pot it fit perfect in the corner. I feel this purchase was a very good choice on my part.. if you are looking for something to warm up a space in your room and give you some sort of calm and balance in a hectic life, try this Olive tree and you\u2019ll be as surprised I am at how different your home will look. Price point was also very reasonable. Win win!!!",

Perfect addition to the room.",

                "reviewText": "This is my third tree that I have ordered. My first two trees were 6 and 5 ft tall, and they are beautiful. I ordered a third tree in a 4 ft size recently and was very surprised at how different it was from the first two I ordered. I am not sure what has happened, but the stem and branches are painted a light green rather than the light tan color of the first two that I previously ordered. I thought there might be a mistake so I decided to order a replacement wondering if it was a mistake. The fourth tree I received is also painted a light green color on the main tree and branches. I am not sure if this is the case for the bigger trees now, but I would definitely not recommend ordering the 4ft tree. If they change the color back to how it used to be, it would drastically change my review.I contacted the seller and they are fantastic on customer service! They are prompt in their communication, polite and friendly in their correspondence, and go above and beyond for customer satisfaction. They have noted the color change in the 4 feet trees and have said that they would be changing out this batch to go back to the original brown color for the branches. They sent pictures to verify that they have gone through their inventory.These are very beautiful trees, and I wouldn't hesitate at all to purchase from this company. They will keep their word and make sure that you are fully satisfied with your purchase. They also don't erase bad reviews and will seek to make it right. No company can be perfect, but it's encouraging to see a company work toward excellence in their business. Athough I initially gave a one star for the color, I am changing it now to a 5 star because of their customer service. Thanks, Realead! I wish more businesses were like your company.",

I got the 7ft tree and the only downside is the base is too small for the tree and it tips over. I have it in a large pot and have towels and sheets filling in the gaps and a weighted blanket on top of the pot base to keep it standing upright. I understand the small pot base is likely so it can fit in most decorative pot openings but it just doesn\u2019t work for this tall of a tree. It would be 5 stars if not for this issue!",
