                "reviewText": "Stardate - March 2021.I have two of these benches, both have been in use daily since Sept 2020, about 6 months. When I travel, I take one with me. One served for a while as a chair/bench for my home office.Both benches are used for bench press, incline bench, spider curls, sit ups, weighted situps, seated military press, rows, flys, french press, etc, etc, etc - all the typical exercises one does with a bench. Thus far, both benches have served very well, without issues. I did not attempt to fully test the 600 lb weight capacity but I did get up around 500 lb and the bench felt stable to me.These are solid/strong benches, but there is some movement under load; this is to be expected with a lightweight folding bench. The little bit of movement is, to me, minor and easy to live with.The back-pad is about 11 inches wide. I'd like a wider pad. But, because \"form ever follows function\", compromises must be made sometimes.Overall, these benches were a solid purchase. Sure, there are bigger, sturdier, and more stable benches out there but they cost more, are not available, and do not fold or travel easily. FlyBirds, on the other hand, were available, did not break the bank, do fold up and travel easily, and they do get the job done. They set up in a snap, and the price is on-point.ProsThey were available during pandemic, at the regular price - kudos to FlyBird Fitness for not price gouging.Delivered in less than a week - amazing considering some fitness companies take 2 weeks to ship a t shirt.Over performs on all expectations. Excellent ROI, great value.Impressive and seemingly accurate max weight rating,Moves, stores, and travels easily.Solid construction, quality materials.Padding is better than expected, very comfortable.Glossy finish on metal and vinyl covering cleans easy.Looks good.Good range of adjustments, heavy duty pins feel solid.Leg attachment is super helpful.Does decline - huge plus.ConsPlastic leg/feed end caps can/will come off sometimes. (fixable with glue)Not absolutely 100% rock solid (minor and expected)Gap between seat/back pad forces me to shift position sometimes. (minor/typical/expected)Had to lubricate detent pins for seat/back adjustment. (minor/expected)Back does not adjust to 90\", there is a slight incline at max upright position. (being picky here)TakeawayGreat value, great return on initial investment. I wanted a bench that I can put in a closet, or the trunk of my car easily. It needed to be comfortable enough so I want to use it, support up to 500 lb, cost less than $200, and be stable enough so I had confidence when lifting some decent weight. This FlyBird met and exceeded all expectations.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using this for 4 months. Here are my thoughts:pros:- assemble it yourself. it's super simple.- per spec it can hold my weight (~200lb) plus more weight than I'll ever press.- it folds up easily and stows out of the way.- it's light and easy to movecons:- the bench itself is a tad high off the ground. It's not a huge issue, but you do feel your feet are a little less planted especially when you are arched up to bench heavy.- the bar that you can lock your feet against seems like an after-thought. I almost never use it, but when I did need it (to get into a stable decline press position) I couldn't find a locking position to make it comfortable.- there are times when you need the bench to be rock solid stable (e.g., when doing bench dips, or when attempting a PB). This bench will rock and sway a bit. In other words you need to keep strict form always, otherwise you may feel the bench wobble under you, which is unsettling and possibly unsafe.- the seat is a bit too wide, and the back rest is slightly too narrow. Not a huge issue, but it does impact some routines: e.g., when doing seated dumbbell curls the dumbbells can graze the seat, and when rolling back with dumbbells or a barbell (e.g., to mount into a skull-crusher position) I'd feel more safe if the bench back support were wider.- the pre-drilled holes for the seatback positions are a bit odd. There's the flat and straight back positions. Those are fine. The decline positions are ok (though I can't lock my legs comfortably, but that's a separate issue). The other incline positions are just a tad too low or too high. I might drill a couple of extra holes exactly where I want them (should be easy enough to do).Despite the negatives I'd recommend this bench for the price and compactness. If you're careful it should serve you well.",

                "reviewText": "I was a little skeptical but after reading others reviews and seeing pics of how compact and durable it appeared in pics I took a chance. For the price point this bench is impressive. Comes fully assembled in a narrow box and it folds in half. I\u2019m 6\u20191 and the back of my head doesn\u2019t hang off the edge when I\u2019m laying flat. Another feature I liked is the seat folds all the way down so for inclines or declines it\u2019s inline with the \u201cbody\u201d of the bench (if that makes sense). It\u2019s very light weight to me and easy to fold up and pick up to put away. Very sturdy and the padding seems pretty good. I think it\u2019s pretty well made. I\u2019ve had several workouts on it this week and it was comfortable.",
