The colors seem very true to what is shown online, and the piece is light-weight and very easy to hang.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Adhesive holding the picture failed",
                "reviewText": "This arrived with the picture detached from the frame - the adhesive evidently failed. It may be a quality control issue, or it may be a poor choice of how to mount the picture. I received this as a \"free\" item, so I'll affix the picture properly and make the repair. Had I purchased it directly, it would've been returned.APPEARANCE: The picture looks fine. It's a print on canvas, adhered to a board that (I think at one point at least) attaches onto the frame. The print is ONLY the front of the board, so the tiny sliver of edge you see on the edge of the picture where it's \"floating\" in the frame is wood. There are other similar products on here that arrived with the printed canvas wrapped all the way around the board, so this picture looks less professional than those.CONSTRUCTION: The frame is lightweight; I think it's a veneered pressed-wood. the print is cut exactly to size and smoothly adhered to the front of a board. The board is then glued to the frame. Mine arrived with the frame glue unstuck. It doesn't look difficult to repair, if you have the patience to re-glue and steady enough hands to get it centered in the frame. It comes with two mounting hooks to push into the wall. The back of the frame is wide enough for some hook and loop strips or perhaps some Command strips to hold it up.NOTE: the exterior dimensions are a little shy of what's advertised at 11 13/16\" x 15 3/4\". The print itself is smaller than that at 11 1/8\" x 15 1/8\".",

                "reviewText": "This \"brown-rose\" painting is a very pleasing addition to my art gallery. The colors are warm, but not too dark (and the staircase where this is has poor lighting). I love the style of the canvas inset into the wood frame and how easy it was to install. It came packaged well and with all the hardware needed to hang it. I don't have any complaints!",
