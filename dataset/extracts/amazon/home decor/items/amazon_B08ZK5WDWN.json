                "reviewText": "I'd purchased these for three of my children before who needed storage in their kitchens, and they loved them. So when my husband and I bought our RV and I had to be very practical with my storage spaces, I turned to these. They're perfect in my pantry! They are stackable, hold everything safely and securely, and are spill-proof, which you know is imperative if you've ever traveled in an RV! I love how they can stack easily, how they have enough different sizes that I can fit anything I want in them, how they clean easily, and the washable labels come in handy when I rearrange things in the containers. I keep buying more because I find so many uses for them. They're very well made, open and close easily yet securely, and best of all, they don't hold odors so I can store dried fruit in them one time and then switch to rice another and the smells don't transfer to the different foods. I highly recommend them!",

                "reviewText": "This seems to be a very good set of containers. They wash up well. The lids fit all of the containers, so I don't have to sort through to find a match. The labels arrived a little bent, but they straightened out just fine once on the containers. The containers are clear, which makes it easy to see when I need more of each product at a glance. My only challenge with these is that I wished to have a little more say in which sizes I took home. I would have liked an option to add in two of the bigger ones, etc. But this set does well. I have a separate set for larger bags of flour, sugar, rice, and quinoa. I also would have liked to see some clear measuring cups included in this set, as it would be nice to scoop from certain containers.I don't love that the tapered shape of the containers means there's wasted space in the gaps between the containers, but it is very nice to have everything stack together so neatly - and I think this is industry standard, so I cannot complain about this too much.My final fuss was that it felt like the lids didn't easily seat. I felt like I had to snap the side pieces to make them really settle. I would have liked to have them settle in a little easier. But it wasn't like I had wrestle them on. It just didn't settle in the way I was expecting. It seems to have sealed just fine. My pantry looks much neater than it did before.Overall, I'm quite pleased with these containers. They seem to do a very good job of holding a variety of pantry items. They fit well together and the universal lids are a great feature. They're solid, good quality containers. I'd buy them again.",

Save yourself some time and after you unwrap them from the packaging, do NOT stack them inside each other. They will suction and become so friggin hard to get back out. Once the lids are on they are very stackable, if you have the right cabinet space. Very pleased with this purchase, I was blown away at the quality and amount you get for the price.",
