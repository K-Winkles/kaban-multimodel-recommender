                "reviewText": "We use these as coat and bag hooks. The are large and simple, they hold a lot of coats piled on top of one another - which is what broke previous coatracks that we had. As you can see, we've got a lot of bags hanging on top of coats. The hooks are nice and deep so you can even pile on a few puffy winter coats without things sliding off. This works great when guests come over in the winter. I've got a second row down near the ground, just high enough to hold the backpacks upright. The backpacks are actually sitting on the floor, but now they never tip over and spill everywhere. You can see in one picture that these hooks are behind the door at the entry of our house. Being so deep they manage to hold a lot without sticking out too far.",
