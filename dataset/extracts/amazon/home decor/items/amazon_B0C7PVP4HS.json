It goes through doorways with very good ease.   I have one concern. It reads this walker holds up to 300 lbs. in weight. I weigh close to 180bls. As I sit on the walker/ pushed through my house. The back wheels crack/ leans sideways. I hope this is just a flaw. I think folks should be aware of this flaw before they purchase this walker. One could receive a bad injury.  The walker may collapse while being pushed sitting on it. ",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE BELOW. On the plus side, this utensil holder is very cute. I was excited to use it to organize some of my utensils on my kitchen counter. Unfortunately, it took less than 2 weeks for the back to pull away from the front of the holder. The back of the holder at each corner was attached to the front with only very small brads, which was not strong enough to hold my utensils. I have fixed it with wood glue on the corners and then pressing the brads back into place. I'm crossing my fingers that my repair works.UPDATE: the company contacted me to offer a replacement. As noted above, I was able to fix the organizer myself, so there was no need to replace it, but I appreciate their response. I am happy with how it looks and how it organizes my utensils. I am increasing my rating to 4 stars.",
