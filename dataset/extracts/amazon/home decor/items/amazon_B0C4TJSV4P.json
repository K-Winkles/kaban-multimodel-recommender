Its design, featuring elegant moon motifs, truly stands out and creates a serene ambiance. The way the smoke gently cascades down like a slow-moving waterfall is mesmerizing, transforming the act of burning incense into a visually soothing experience.One of the highlights of this burner is its versatility. It's not just a functional item but also serves as a stunning piece of decor. Whether you're using it during meditation, yoga, or simply as a means to unwind after a long day, it sets the perfect mood and contributes to a calming environment.However, it's important to note that the backflow hole tends to get clogged with regular use. To maintain the smooth flow of smoke, it's advisable to keep a pin or toothpick handy to clear out any blockages. Regular cleaning is essential to keep the burner functioning properly and to ensure the best experience.Despite this minor maintenance requirement, the Moon Incense Burner is a wonderful addition to any space. It makes for an excellent gift for those who appreciate a touch of elegance and zen in their surroundings. Overall, if you're looking for an incense burner that combines functionality with exquisite design, this is a great choice",

                "reviewText": "It really does make a smoke waterfall. Really cool. The incense burns right under the top of the moon which leaves a nasty residue, so the design could be a little better, but overall I really like it. Plus its a good deal as it comes with a bunch of incense cones and sticks and tweezers. It also comes with a cheesy pad to set it on which I threw away.",

I would recommend to not have the fan going or the smoke won't go on the incense correctly. Also, to not be in front of the cone because the smoke couldn't be going towards you, or you will be coughing a storm.",
