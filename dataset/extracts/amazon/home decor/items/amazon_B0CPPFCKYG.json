                "reviewText": "What a beautiful smudge bowl/chimney! It looks nice whether or not it's in use which I love. Very simple and understated, but not boring. The ceramic is thick and the glaze is well done, so it feels sturdy. I love the moon phase cut outs, reminding me that everything ebbs and flows. Once my smudge stick is smoldering I can pop it in and not worry about a mess or something else falling into the embers. This is a great addition to an alter or a yoga studio. I have it just at my house. It's also a great gift idea.",

                "reviewText": "I am in love with the ZenBless 3 in 1 incense burner. It is hand-crafted out of a nice smooth ceramic material. I really love the multi-functional design and I am going to be using it with Sage and Santo Palo for my Smudging practices. I also love the moon phases cut-outs. It reminds me of out with the old energy and in with new energy and the cycling of life. I also just love the simplicity of a tea light candle flickering through the moon cycle cut outs. ZenBless also thoughtfully included a tweezers and cleaning brush to make cleaning up the ashes much easier. I think that this 3 in 1 holder/chimney would make a wonderful addition to anyone\u2019s Sage/Santo Palo or incense burning experience and collection, and it would also make a very special gift idea. I highly recommend checking out the ZenBless 3 in 1 incense holder!",

It comes with tweezers and a fan brush to remove the ashes. No more ashes on the counter for me.",

                "reviewText": "I enjoy burning palo santo, sage bundles, and incense cones; but I didn't always like the trays/dishes/surfaces that I'd been using for them. This ZenBless 3 in 1 Incense Holder intrigued me at first glance, so I picked it up.I was pleasantly surprised at the mantra/saying on the top of the box - even before opening I felt that I'd made the right choice.Upon opening, I saw the well-packed/-cushioned incense holder, along with a long tweezer and a brush, used to easily clean the base of the dish out after each use. The holder itself is lovely and, upon setting up/burning my rose-sage bundle, I saw that the smoke feeds up and out through only the hole at the top, which I believe allows for a longer burn - I might be wrong, but my sage bundle seemed to stay lit longer than it would on an open dish.This is overall a great choice, either for yourself or as a gift - had I not needed something like this for so long, I would have gifted it to someone - I have a FEW friends who I know would also appreciate/enjoy it. :)",
