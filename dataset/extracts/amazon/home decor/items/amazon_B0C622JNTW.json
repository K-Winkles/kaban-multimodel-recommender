                "reviewText": "This vase is stunning! Absolutely gorgeous! This is great for both fresh flowers and pampas. I plan on using it for pampas. Make sure to grab the long-stem ones as it is a pretty tall vase. Also very wide, so if using it for flowers you will need a pretty large bouquet. The glass isn't thick which I actually really like. If it comes in another color I will definitely grab one for the living room. A must-have for a mid-century modern or luxury look decor!",
