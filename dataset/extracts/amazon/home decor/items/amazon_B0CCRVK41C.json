                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I absolutely LOVE it!!! It\u2019s acrylic-ish so do consider where you plan to place it/weight restrictions. It is small but the grooves at the top provide some balance. It\u2019s not really made for short arrangements. I tested this $4 bouquet from the grocery store in it. I cut down the base longer than necessary the first time and they fell over a bit too much and looked thin. I trimmed another two inches or so and it\u2019s perfect. Don\u2019t forget to do this before plant food/water to avoid messy spills. Use a stem to stir if you like. Then place them back inside. I could have added more but I will move it to my office as it is for now. I love it so much that I just ordered 2 more and shared to my mom and best friend & they ordered one . I love that now when I receive flowers, I can excitedly pull out this vase. I love books and it\u2019s so delicate against my maximalist aesthetic. I just needed this , a candle, & a cute mug to drink tea and start my day. My desk setup is about to be perfection!",

Yes, it is very steady, especially when there is water in it, and it can hold several flowers. The clear one is better for kitchen counter, but the black one could be better for study room. It would be better if they can sell several vases together as a set. The price is fair.",
