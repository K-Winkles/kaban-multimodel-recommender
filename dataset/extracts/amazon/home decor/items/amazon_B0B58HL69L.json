                "reviewText": "I love the scent; However it doesn't last - or should I say it doesn't stay as strong as it is the first couple weeks. I started with just a few sticks and eventually employed all of them. I flipped the sticks to try to get the scent back but almost zero result. The bottle is still full of fluid so this is really disappointing, and why I'm changing my review to a lower mark.I did some research and I have heard that some of these have alcohol added, and if there is too much alcohol is evaporates the oil. I'm guessing the alcohol is cheaper than the oil and so instead of providing a useful product this is done instead for cost savings. Then again, perhaps it's not possible to get a reed oil diffuser to work for more than a week? If this is the case tho, why not just have a bottle 1/10 the size, and reduce the price.EDIT - the scent is not strong like the first week, but it is there. I wish it were stronger, but it's at least lasted a month and can keep a bathroom smelling pleasant. At this price-point, the product here is a much better deal than other reed diffusers which are 2 and 3 times the price. I'm moving review to 4 stars for that reason, tho it really should be 3.5 stars.",

I felt it for 2-3 days maximum. Now I have 2/3 of the bottle and no smell. Only when you smell the bottle directly you can feel it. But in the room - no. It's a pity. I bought 2, vanilla is the most delicious so far.",

                "reviewText": "I loved that the scent filled my small space. However, the scent was a little artificial smelling. It didn\u2019t last as long as I would have liked. There is still liquid left in the bottle, and I have flipped the reeds several times, but the scent is gone after about a month. I would consider buying the brand again in a different scent, and with the understanding it might just last a month. Fair value for the price though.",
