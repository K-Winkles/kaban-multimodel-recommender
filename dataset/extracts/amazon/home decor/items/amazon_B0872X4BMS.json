Previously everything was propped up in a corner and they would fall over and just look untidy. This mount makes everything much neater. It was very easy to install, all mounting hardware is included. I use this for Swiffer mops and brooms, brushes. It's easy to use, everything fits in the mount well without having to force things into it. it seems sturdy and nothing has fallen out. it's been up for a few months with no problems. It comes with hooks that may come in useful too. This was everything I needed at a very good price.",

                "reviewText": "My previous broom rack required special maneuvering of the broom handle in order to insert it into the fastener. Over time, the push and pull of removing and returning broom handles onto the rack caused the drywall anchors to loosen and then I had a wobbly broom rack. I purchased this rack for my walk in pantry because, unlike my previous one, this one has a raised end on the fasteners that hold the broom handles which makes it easy to manually open the fastener to insert a broom handle. Fast forward to installing this product, it was very easy. I used a power drill to create pilot holes for the drywall anchors and then the drill made screwing the rack to the wall very fast and effortless. The design flaw lies in that this rack is very thin and the fasteners sit very close to the wall. So in my case, I have a Bona mop that has a thick handle and a large container attached to the base and this requires more space between the handle and wall for it to stay securely on the rack. Within 3 minutes of placing the Bona mop on the rack, it slipped off and fell to the floor. I had no issues with my swiffer or my small broom and dustpan. I plan to add a wood base to the wall and then place the rack over it to create more space between the fasteners and the wall. For this reason, I give it 3 stars. Had the fasteners sat further from the wall, I would have no issues with it and would have given it 5 stars.",
