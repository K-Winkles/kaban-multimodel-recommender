Fabric is soft and maybe a little thin but not horribly so. NOT see through as some people described. Didn't look like the old 'grandma' quilts for beds lol. As for any 'shedding' problems I believe people who say this may not have followed the directions in the description. WASH FIRST. I washed these on delicate cycle in cold water. Dried in the dryer on low heat. Removed promptly and put on pillows...didn't even need to iron them at all. No shedding problems and dramatically transformed the look of the room. I highly recommend these pillow covers. I ordered the color beige.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the white covers and grey covers and got the 20in size - they are soft and cozy and slipped onto my existing cushions effortlessly. They look good and feel quality. The grey & while work really well - the zippers match the cushion cover colour - I find adding soft covers for the winter is a great and inexpensive way of adding a touch of luxury and a nice space for winter evenings. These are great. I\u2019m happy with my purchase and recommend that you measure your existing cushion before buying. \ud83d\udecb\ufe0f \u2615\ufe0f",
