                "reviewText": "I bought these a little before Black Friday, when they were on special for $26. I was a little nervous, as these are plastic, and I was worried they would look very fake. They don't. They have a gentle, subtle flickering that is pleasing to the eye. The timer on the remote works like a champ --I have these set up so that they are lit for me when I get home from work, and they stay lit until I go to bed. Generally, I don't have to touch them, except when one of them mysteriously turns itself off (easy enough to turn the trouble maker back on with the remote).It's very handy that this large set comes with 2 remotes. I have six in windows and three under the Christmas tree, so they are spread out around the house. They make me smile every day. If you are on the fence with this purchase, my advice is to go for it. You get 9 candles and 2 remotes for a good price, and I'm anticipating they should work for at least a few years. The 2 remotes would also make it easy to gift a few, if you're feeling generous. : )",

                "reviewText": "I was shocked at the price of candles that have a very realistic flame effect where a translucent flame shaped object moves in front of a LED bulb. At $70 for 2, this was too expensive as I needed 15 candles. I have a built-in bookshelf that I could not run AC power to for regular LED shelf lighting. I purchased 2 sets of 9 for the price of 2 flickering candles. These do the job and they look very nice. The timer is relative so once you start the candles at a specific time, you can choose between 2, 4 and 6 hours. I turned down the brightness in hopes of extending battery life which is advertised at 300 hours. Unlike other candles in this category, it was converted to run on a single AA battery and the body is plastic rather than wax. All positive changes.",

I like that they come with a remote to turn them on/off or to set a timer. Three of the candles are a little darker in color and somewhat difficult to see the light flicker so I didn\u2019t use them in the picture because they didn\u2019t match well. Not sure what the logic was behind making 3 of them a darker gray\u2026maybe for more variety? I can use them somewhere else in the house though.",
