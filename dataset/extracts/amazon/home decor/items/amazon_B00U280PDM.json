Only suggestion I\u2019d make is to have clips that clamp the wire cage to the wood base so you could pick up the entire thing in one piece. Regardless, these do an excellent job of keeping my cats safe from burning candles.",

A bit pricey relative to what I would normally pay for the same style at Homesense but these are not normal times. Another thing I like about these is the ability to burn a candle without any danger of overheating like some lanterns. I love the convenience and speed of shopping on Amazon. I liked the first set I ordered so much that I ordered another. Both arrived on time and in perfect condition. Highly recommended.",
