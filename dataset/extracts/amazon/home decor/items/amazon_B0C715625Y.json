                "reviewText": "I was so pleasantly surprised when I opened the box and saw this wax melting lamp with two bulbs and separate packages. The lampshade is thick glass. It\u2019s not fragile at all. The neck of the lamp is made of brass. The bottom is made of wood it will hold a Yankee candle in the drawer easily when you bring the lamp up to its highest height, screw the neck tightly, and it is absolutely stunning. The light has a timer you can set the light to just a nightlight low, medium and high and you can set it for two hours four hours or eight hours, and it shuts itself off at eight hours. Melting the wax on high or medium is perfect and the smell in the room is just wonderful. This lamp is gorgeous. Don\u2019t hesitate. It is very sturdy and worth the money. I plan on buying several more as gifts for people who love to light candles, which is unsafe.",

I have it on a table in front of a window. I have a medium sized jar candle on it and it smells wonderful. It is good for an accent lamp, I wouldn't use it for reading a book. When it came, which was super timely, it was packaged very well and came with 2 bulbs that I have not seen before. I do hope replacement ones are not difficult to find.",

I feel a lot safer having this on instead of burning candles and it looks so cute with all my other decor.",

Only reason I can't give 5 star is because when changing the height, you have to unscrew a part on the stem and retighten it where you want it secured. But you can still turn it around when it's supposed to be secure. Probably not a problem for most if you don't plan on moving it around much, but it's something I'll have to watch out for.",
