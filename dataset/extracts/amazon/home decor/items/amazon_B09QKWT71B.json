The size is perfect, not too big and not too small, I'm able to fit two sticks of butter if I want to but it doesn't crowd my counter. I've never had the butter melt or go bad, even during the hottest days in the summer. The lid seals perfectly with a suction affect but isn't hard to remove. My kids have knocked it off the counter multiple times and it didn't even dent, it feels unbreakable. The only negative is the knife doesn't stay in the spot very well and eventually it's been misplaced. I keep a list of my favorite items to gift to friends and this is at the top. Buy it!",
