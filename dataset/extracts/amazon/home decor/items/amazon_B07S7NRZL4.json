It is really easy to put together\u2026maybe 15 min to unpack and have together. Very sturdy. Fold up easily so that is a plus. Adjustment knobs are spring loaded over screws for convenience and screw in to secure.. I got the newer version. It was 30.00 more than the older one. Not sure what the differences are, with exception of increased weight capacity. Either way\u2026still very cheap for a folding bench with this level of adjustment and capacity.",

                "reviewText": "Bench feels very sturdy, no wobble, no sharp edges, cushions are comfortable, quick to adjust angle. Only minor complaints are when you make it completely flat the gap between the seat and the backrest is pretty big and kind of uncomfortable on the lower back. And the feet at the front are a bit far forward which kind of get in the way so you have to put the weights further in front of you and reach further to pick them up off the floor which is also not great for the lower back.But overall extremely good value since the materials are good quality it should last pretty much forever so definitely worth the money.",
