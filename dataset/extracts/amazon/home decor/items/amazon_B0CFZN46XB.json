Ruskin Bond \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 - Good intro to this topic, lots of great ideas throughoutThis book gave me a good framework or lens to work from - I especially liked the color psychology section, ideas to add texture to spaces E. Sander From the Author Following a profound bout of depression, I, as a renowned interior designer, underwent a transformative healing experience, a significant part of which I attribute to the meticulous and intentional redesign of my own bedroom. The walls, now bathed in the optimistic hue of sunshine yellow, became more than just a backdrop; they became a canvas of hope and renewal. Interspersed with cherished family photos, memories of happier times came alive. The room was also adorned with luxuriously cozy textiles, offering tactile solace, and treasured keepsakes that narrated tales of my past. This wasn't just about aesthetic appeal; it was a therapeutic cocoon of warmth, comfort, and inspiration built from the knowledge of my profession. Each morning, the space I had thoughtfully curated reflected back my resilience, identity, and the enduring beauty of life. The positive symbiosis between my psyche and my surroundings became undeniably palpable. Each corner of my room seemed to emanate a vibrant energy, uplifting my spirits and reinforcing a brighter outlook on life. With a heart brimming with gratitude and recognizing the power of intentionally designed spaces, I channeled my professional expertise and personal revelations into 'Dopamine Decor.' This book is not just a testament to my journey but an invitation to others to explore the therapeutic potential of their environments. My aspiration is for it to guide others in crafting sanctuaries of joy and solace, showcasing that, even amidst life's tumults, our surroundings can be a balm to our souls. As an acclaimed figure in the world of interior design, my goal is to now fuse emotional well-being with design, sharing this unique blend of joy with the world."
