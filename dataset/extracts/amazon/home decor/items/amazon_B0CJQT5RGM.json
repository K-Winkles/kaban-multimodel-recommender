Pointed fragments of glass that has a built in child magnet that always attracts trouble to kids inventing KIDS in trouble an l there's no need to worry about potential harm to children, making these frames a safe and practical choice for any household.One tradition that is mounted in our hall of frames is the yearly school pictures. It is a ton of fun to jab at each other as we laugh of school time memories and jab at the hair cuts, Charlie brown shirts and missing teeth. We have all been framed and hope that this tradition never gets lost in a smart phone.",

They're light and it's not glass, so if you have kids like I do, you don't need to fret about little hands grabbing them.I don't like that a couple of the frames aren't a 90 degree corner. I didn't realize until I'd hung them up. I measured and leveled each one and somehow my wall looked off. Well, because a couple weren't 90 degrees it made my pictures look wobbly. It's not enough that anyone else would notice. But my eye goes to those frames every single time.",

                "reviewText": "I got this mostly for the weathered finished frames in the set, because this set is so inexpensive for so many frames it becomes a great value. If you're like me and only want a few frames in this set for a specific decor purpose, you can get the whole thing and the ones that don't fit that room's decor you can either use them elsewhere where they fit better, or just give them to people. From afar these frames look good, especially when they're not the centerpiece of attention (like using these in a larger design presentation with more eye catching pieces). Upon closer examination, you can tell the frames are kind of cheaply made, with the engineered wood looking kind of plastic and the glass is a plexiglass. But similar to artificial plants, these look good when they're used in a \"zone 2\" capacity, meaning they're not super close to where people would look at them within arm's reach, but are close enough to see the subjects in the pictures, basically background use pictures.",
