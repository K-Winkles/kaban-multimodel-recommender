That\u2019s a lot in a shelf! These were perfect for holding my Le Creuset collection of cast iron pots and cookbooks! I love having them on display in my kitchen and they save me so much pantry space. I was able to get more cookbooks than I had previously just because of the extra storage. I love how good they look mixed in with my colorful pots. I highly recommend them!!",

My only complaint is that you will need another person to help put it together, (PS MAKE SURE THE GRAIN OF THE WOOD IS GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION FOR EVERY SHELF bc i had to redo that) but if you have someone to help its overall very simple. Definitely worth the money and its so easy to decorate and to hide cords too so its perfect if you want lights/electronics on the shelf.",
