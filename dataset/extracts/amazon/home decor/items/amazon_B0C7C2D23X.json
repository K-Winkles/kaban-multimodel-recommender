I bought this for my guest room and so far everyone that has stayed has commented on how great it smells in the room.

                "reviewText": "I ordered the Shangri La (smells like an amber musk) and Lavender. These are beautiful diffusers - aesthetically appealing - and smell strong when using all diffuser reeds.My biggest con with these diffusers is that neither of them arrived full (not anywhere close to the 100 ml capacity as advertised by the photos). I also noticed this with other reviewer pics but no one has commented on that.I understand this is a fragrance oil and, even with the best intentions and wrapping (which was great), spills may happen. In fact, my Lavender one arrived with such an ordeal, and I was too excited to start using these gorgeous diffusers that I didn\u2019t pause to take pictures of the inner package that had wet staining. The Shangri La one fared better in transit and didn\u2019t lose any oil. The inner packaging was completely dry.That said, they were both delivered 8/14 and it is now 8/21 (7 days later). Look at the pics. To have such little oil already after one week is not worth it to me, personally, for the price I paid. Perhaps it would be if they arrived nearly full in the first place, but they don\u2019t.I wish the company would sell these fragrant oils in separate, airtight bottles so that customers can keep these lovely bottles and refill them when they\u2019re nearly empty. I also wish they would fill their bottles so that customers receive what they pay for (what they see in the advertised photos of a full bottle of 100 ml of fragrance oil).Hope this review helps others!UPDATE: Added 2 stars back to my review because seller reached out to me with a full refund for the diffusers. Excellent customer service! Also, I bought separate fragrance oil from Walmart and refilled these bottles because they\u2019re too nice to throw away.",
