                "reviewText": "Honestly, the most realistic \"faux\" candles I have seen. I got my hands on these Glass Battery Operated LED Flameless Candles, and they're a game-changer! As a 40-year-old mom who loves hosting and chilling at home with my husband and daughter, these candles have become my new go-to for creating the perfect vibe.First off, the flame design is legit!!! The LED flames are so realistic that my guests thought they were real. It's like having the real deal without the hassle. And the remote control? Total convenience. I can set timers, switch between flickering and steady glow, and from anywhere in the room \u2013 it's like having a candle but on your terms.Safety-wise, these candles are ideal if you have little kids. My daughter is already 12 but it makes me better knowing that I don't have to worry about it. No worrying about flames with a curious 12-year-old around. Perfect for family gatherings, and I can focus on the fun without stressing about accidents.The set includes three sizes. I ended up ordering 2 sets so I have 6 candles. It's also awesome for decorations for birthdays, Christmas, or just regular home chillin'.I ordered rechargeable AAA batteries, and I have have had them on and off for several days and nights and they're still going strong. It looks like they're energy-efficient and will last many hours.In a nutshell, if you want that cozy feel without the fire drill, I highly recommend grabbing a set! I'm very happy with this purchase and they've become a staple in my home, setting the perfect mood for fam hangouts and friendly get-togethers.",

I have purchased so many battery operated candles over the years..some I really liked while others were disappointing at best.When I came across these..I loved the idea of the glass candle. So I ordered one set.when they arrived I immediately placed them and turned them on...WOW! The glass feature makes the candle much brighter thus lighting up more of an area.So I immediately placed another order for another set in the color gold. The wax is real..the flame can either flicker or remain steady...you control it.What I really love is the remote feature..and placing these in hard to reach areas..like my vaulted ceiling nooks. The battery lasted about 30 days when I left the set on the 4hr timer. If you're looking for a different style battery operated candle..this is it!",

They\u2019re battery operated (they use 2 AA batteries per candle), can run on a timer and the flame actually flickers like a real flame would minus having actual lit candles. I love the ambiance these create. I love that I can set them on a timer (2hrs, 4hrs, 6hrs or 8hrs). I can turn these on before going to bed and not worry about creating a fire hazard. Make sure to use alkaline batteries in these candles and NOT rechargeable ones. I don\u2019t know why, but using rechargeable ones makes the lights appear dim and dull and not bright and shining like alkaline batteries do. These are beautiful and have fooled a lot of people into thinking that they\u2019re real when in fact they are not. I highly recommend these. Even the price point is great.",
