We were fortunate enough to order these. When they came, my husband did not have to drill new holes to install them. The blinds easily slid into the former casings that were already attached. It was a simple matter of taking out the old, sliding in the new. Viola! Our room darkening venetian blinds were up and working. Very pleased with them and the cost didn't break the bank.",

That is the one shown on the video. Since it\u2019s hard to turn the turning rod as it\u2019s not on the outside of the window, when we try to turn it, the rod comes off easily.
