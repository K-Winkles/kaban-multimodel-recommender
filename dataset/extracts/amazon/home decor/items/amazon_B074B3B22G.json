            "WHY SQUAT: Squats are not only effective for building an insanely strong lower body, but also because they deliver a number of ancillary physical benefits, including increased hormone release and improved flexibility.",
            "HOW IT WORKS: Tone the lower body by using your glutes, quads, and hamstrings to push down to a squat. Work your shoulders, back, and chest as you push yourself up through every rep. Skip the weights, this squat trainer will reduce the amount of stress on the knees and joints that occurs when you squat incorrectly. Adding this to your workout will help you develop a proper form to get the perfect squat.",
            "TRACK YOUR FITNESS: The LCD monitor tracks your calories, scan, time, and count. This trainer gives you the freedom to add or remove tension, the three elastic bands can be clipped on or off the seat to adjust to any fitness level.",
            "WORKOUT VARIETY: Not only does it offer the ability to do a full-range squat but you can also add variety by doing high, median and low zone squats pulses. Non-slip foot pedals",
            "CONVENIENCE: Easily store almost anywhere in your home. Remove the knob, fold, and store; as easy as 1, 2, 3. Its self-leveling pedals help you to get in and out of the bike in a breeze. Stable end caps prevent any movement to ensure you have a stable and safe workout."

Something that worked the main groups and made hard work seem easy. This is the thing that i was looking for. And it was affordable. I really like this machine. Its fun to use and its easy to adjust the difficulty. And you can make it pretty difficult. Put the seat all the way down and attach the resistance bands and it will challenge you. Adjust the other way and remove the bands and its comfortable and more cardio oriented. I like this much more than an elliptical or a rowing machine. Great little machine. Sturdy and quiet. Wont be a coat rack if you have any type of motivation at all. This is worth the price and the time.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Good so far with a couple of caveats",
                "reviewText": "I'm a person who typically exercises regularly: Hiking, cycling, weight lifting -- but an illness followed by a major orthopedic injury has had me in healing mode for over a year and as a result, I'm seriously de-conditioned. I ordered this little machine to help me ease back into a fitness routine and so far, it seems to be just the right piece of equipment. Please note that you will need a ratchet/socket set to assemble and you will need to purchase an equipment mat if this machine will be placed on a hard floor to prevent \"walking\" during use. Also, the instructions look more complicated than is necessary. I recommend searching for \"Row-N-Ride Assembly\" on YouTube. The machine comes about 90% assembled; if not for the quality-control problem that I ran into (see below), I would've had this thing put together in about 15 minutes.The good: Inexpensive, lightweight, easy to maneuver, REALLY targets quads and glutesThe burn is real. I had to start off with a very light workout because my legs were screaming after a few minutes.The bad:The major issue is one that I didn't see discussed in the few reviews I read prior to purchase. Made-in-China quality control, such as it is, is evident here. As mentioned above, this machine comes almost fully assembled. The only components that the user must attach are the feet, the pedals, the handlebar, the seat, and the digital display. With the video instructions, assembly goes very quickly. However, mine came pre-assembled incorrectly. The entire central assembly was bolted in backward and upside-down, so I ended up having to take the entire thing apart and reverse/flip the central component that has the pedals and handlebar at opposite ends. That added another 30 minutes or so to the assembly time.I\"ll add that the light mass means that this machine also feels a little flimsy, so it remains to be seen how well it will hold up over time with regular use, which I anticipate. I'll be glad to update my review with any new observations. If I end up liking this one, I'll probably step up to the upgraded version down the road. Still, for the price, I'm overall satisfied so far.",

                "reviewText": "Updated after 10 days of use: I have been using this product for 10 days, 15 minutes a day, pulsing for 30 seconds every 3 minutes otherwise using a full range of motion. After 4 days I felt confident to start using 1 resistance band during my 15 minute workout. I was able to burn 100 calories in a 15 minute workout. I lost 2 inches on my hips ONLY adjusting my workout routine by using this product. Day 1: black pants. Day 10: gray pants. Noticeable tightening and toning. No weight loss.Day 1 of use: First of all, I bought this machine used on here with a major imperfection for $42. I figured it was worth a shot after looking at the dB method and realizing that it was out of my budget. Honestly, I liked this one more because this one also works the upper body. The imperfection on my machine was a missing bolt that allowed the seat to communicate with the handle bars\u2014I just found a bolt wah-lah! And the monitor came completely smashed. I wasn\u2019t planning to use that anyway since I look at my Nokia fit screen for my calories and heart rate ( I have a heavy duty stand that attaches to any of my workout equipment to display it). Anyway, the machine provides a superb workout. I already have larger thighs but need some toning in my glutes so I was worried that this machine would over work my thighs, and was looking for a machine that isolated my glutes. What I can say is that with this machine, you feel no burn in your calves, but you feel an intense burn in your lower mid back/butt, and latts. I never thought I would own a piece of cardio equipment that worked out the lower back so efficiently. I would NOT rely on this machine to tone your upper back and arms. You are going to need a rowing machine for that. BUT WOW, this machine is so worth it because it does isolate the glutes, and an unbelievable lower back workout that is way more fun than Superman\u2019s. I have a resting heart rate of 48 and I did this machine for 10 minutes and my heart rate was a steady 130 the entire time with no added resistance bands. It\u2019s not a great cardio exercise, but it\u2019s awesome that it is isolating key muscle groups that are really hard to isolate on any other machine. ONE THING TO NOTE. On the DB website it shows you can isolate your triceps by working out with the seat, you can also do that with this seat as long as you put 2-3 resistance bands on the seat. You cannot work your abs with this seat because it\u2019s not piston driven\u2014it\u2019s driven by your own body weight with resistance bands. Hope this helps you guys. If you are considering this machine even for a moment, it\u2019s seriously worth it. Best Buy I\u2019ve had in awhile.",

I like that it folds up to take up less space when not in use. You can adjust the tension level for a more effective work out. Very simple to use. If you are a beginner you can leave the tension strap hooked under the seat for no added tension and it still gives a work out. I like that it works multiple areas of the body at once. All in all I would recommend this machine.",

                "reviewText": "For the price I was expecting it would not be a strong piece of equipment and was amazed how well built this is! Not too difficult to put together either as most of it came bolted together. Nearly all bolts and screws attached so that you wouldn't need to go hunting for them or checking you have enough when attaching 4 other bits of the frame!Over a few days of use the performance has been great. I have looked at various videos of their recommended exercises and I'm already getting results in my fitness level. I'm seeing some toning of legs, arms and core. I've still a long way to go to achieve my fitness goals but with regular use I can see this will do the trick.Really happy I got this and of course it folds together making it great to stand against a wall, under the bed, stairs or in a cupboard. Can't fault this gym equipment.I bought a treadmill from some other company before this purchase which cost me 2 1/2 times the price and it was dreadful. The belt would slide around and just walking or jogging on it was a limited form of exercise. I had to return it. I was just lucky to see an equivalent model of the row n ride advertised on QVC which was an old video. After some research of the different models I decided to to go for the Sunny Health & Fitness one. I don't regret it.I'm looking to having an all-over toned body with a strong flat core. I'm no young 20 something either! But exercising will improve anyone's body whatever their age!",
