Not non slip for the table itself, but it\u2019s not advertised that way anyway. Kids also enjoy throwing them around the room like frisbees as a game- so duel uses, so that\u2019s a win!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Stylish Sips with a Few Quirks",
                "reviewText": "I'm a fan of a stylish coaster, and the Mckanti 8-piece set caught my eye with its minimalist woven design and handy storage holder. After using them for a while, I have to say they're mostly a hit, but not without a few quirks.The Good:Looks that last: These coasters are undeniably charming. The woven cotton adds a touch of texture and warmth to any tabletop, and the four neutral colors (grey, beige, brown, and dark grey) blend seamlessly with most decors. They're a definite step up from your average boring cork coaster!Absorbent heroes: Spills happen, and these coasters handle them like champs. The cotton quickly soaks up condensation and drips, protecting your surfaces from water rings and stains. No more coasters turning into soggy islands!Keeper of the coasters: The included metal holder is a nice touch. It keeps the coasters organized and accessible when not in use, preventing them from getting scattered around like tumbleweeds. Plus, it looks pretty sleek sitting on the counter.Easy care: A quick hand wash or spot clean is all it takes to keep these coasters looking fresh. No need for complicated washing routines or harsh chemicals.The Quirky:Size matters: These coasters are on the smaller side, measuring 4.3 inches in diameter. While they're perfect for standard glasses and mugs, larger cups or tumblers might require some coaster Tetris to fit comfortably.Heat caution: While the coasters absorb condensation well, they're not designed for hot beverages. Placing a steaming mug directly on them might leave a mark or damage the cotton. A heat pad between the mug and coaster is recommended for hot drinks.Not dishwasher friendly: Although handwashing is a breeze, some dishwasher convenience would be nice. Just be aware that these coasters aren't meant for the machine.Overall Verdict:Despite the minor quirks, I really enjoy using the Mckanti coasters. They're stylish, absorbent, and functional (with a little heat caution). The included holder is a bonus, and the price point is very reasonable. If you're looking for a set of coasters that add a touch of style and function to your home without breaking the bank, I recommend giving these a try. Just keep the size and heat limitations in mind.",
