It\u2019s about the desire to transform something unused into something functional and beautiful. Most people have already upcycled something before and just didn\u2019t know that it was called upcycling! 2. What tips can you offer people just starting out with upcycling, who may not feel handy with tools and a paintbrush? The beauty of upcycling is that you can start small. For instance, it\u2019s easy to turn almost anything into a planter! One of our most popular upcycles ever is the featured wine cork planters tutorial on the cover of the book. Those are easy to do and a great first project. No complicated tools are required, you just need a small kitchen knife and a hot glue gun! The beauty of upcycling is that you can start small. For instance, it\u2019s easy to turn almost anything into a planter! One of our most popular upcycles ever is the featured wine cork planters tutorial on the cover of the book. Those are easy to do and a great first project. No complicated tools are required, you just need a small kitchen knife and a hot glue gun! It\u2019s also really simple to make your own soy-wax teacup candles. There are also a lot of fun projects that just involve glue. Like the gorgeous three-tiered tray. 3. What is the biggest benefit you\u2019ve experienced since you started upcycling? When you begin upcycling you start to look at the world around you differently. You begin to see value where you once saw trash. It\u2019s a really fun creative outlet! 4. While sourcing items for upcycling projects, what has been your best find? I once found a single dresser drawer in my alley and turned it into a coffee table with a piece of glass on top and some hairpin legs. It was inlaid with velvet and it was great for housing a collection. 5. Do you have a favorite upcycling project thus far? We\u2019d love to see photos! It\u2019s super fun to make upcycled lighting. This can be super simple like this fire truck lamp on page 202, or you can learn to cut wine bottles and transform them! I love the Mondrian glass pendant light made from wine bottles on page 210. This tutorial in the book also teaches you how to do this faux stained-glass technique.",
