The gnome's hat and holiday hands are easy to swap out using the Velcro backing and the pictures are behind each other in the frames and are easy to replace as well. HOWEVER, it doesn't come with any instructions. I didn't know what to do with the piece of material till I saw the drawing on the front of the box, there are a bunch of small and medium sized round Velcro tabs that are sticky backed that I have no idea what to do with. The banner pieces come with a rope for each and you have to string each piece onto it, but there's no directions about how you're supposed to attach it to your \"cake\" tower. It does come with a Thank You card that tells you how to get help with your product but I'd rather the instructions be part of the package.",
