I used a silicone tray before and it would accumulate water and would need to be washed n dried many times to prevent gross mildew. I was excited to find this tray . The tray is lifted up by legs with soft cushioned bottoms to prevent scratching any surfaces. Water on the surface soaks right up quickly and does not drip off the sides. The tray also has slight grooves in it as an extra measure to prevent any pooling of sorts. As an extra bonus this tray is very cool looking too ! This was a great purchase \ud83d\udc4c",

I have one in each bathroom and they work like a charm. No mildew, no nasty stuff hiding out, they evaporate water and are super easy to clean and quick dry. They look great too and hold several items! Definitely would buy again!",

The legs were easy to assemble and I appreciate it came with felt tabs for the feet so it wouldn't scratch the countertops. These absorb and dry out water ridiculously fast. They also will dry out your hands when you're assembling them so maybe they work too well lol. Gets the job done keeping the toothbrushes, soap dispenser, and all that extra water off the counter.",
