But beyond that, they hold a large enough amount so as not to need refilling often. The size and number of the holes also allow a smooth flow of seasoning but prevent a meal-ruining dump of either salt or pepper.",

Not so small that they always need filling, and not unnecessarily large either. Whatever they are made of (glass is part of the answer) it doesn't feel cheap. Yes, there's something quite delightful going on here, a synthesis of colour and cheeky contemporary/retro - (oxymoron I know) - design. Great for everyday use, - and would make a good gift too.",
