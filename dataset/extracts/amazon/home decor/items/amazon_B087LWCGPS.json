                "reviewText": "We went to one of our new favorite Italian restaurants in Miami FL, Coppola's Bistro. They had these lights on each table with the overhead lights off. It looks great and with the adjustable lights, you can set to a low mode for dining and mid to high range to read the menu. My wife had me take a photo of the brand and lamp type because she loved the simplicity of these. We ordered two for our dining room table. They work better the LED candles. These lamps have a long battery life as well. They are very sturdy, but light enough to move and carry around. We have a complete smart home, but these are great for manual setting when we sit down to eat at the dining room table. They will also be great when we have a power outage since they are easy to carry around and have a long battery life.",

It has multiple light settings that are touch activated which is such a convenient feature (no fiddling around to find a button). However, even on the brightest setting it is still low lighting. I use it to journal but it's been used to light am intinate dinner table as well. I traveled on the road for months and brought this with me! It's a sleek retro design and looks more expensive than it is. I love it and have repurchased as a gift.",

The lamp easily recharges, and a charge is supposedly good for 48 hours. (We haven't timed it). They're small and attractive and provide a lot of light for a small lamp. You just have to tap it to turn it on and off, and between on and off, there are three levels of brightness.I've got one by my computer, so it's perfect at night when I don't want to put on the overhead lights or use a bigger lamp. We purchased one for the kitchen table as an emergency light source since it is hurricane season, and sometimes we lose power during inclement weather.You can't go wrong with this purchase. We purchase two in the chrome (silver) color and one black one. We highly recommend them.PS if you lose electrical power you could easily charge them with any independent charger that is capable of charging your phone.",
