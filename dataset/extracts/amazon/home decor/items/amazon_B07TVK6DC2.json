        "description": "Snake Plant features variegated, green foliage. The Snake Plant is great for tabletops. It does well in spaces that have bright, indirect sunlight. Place Snake Plant in a spot that receives bright light (5 or more hours of sunlight). Water your plant about once a week with approximately 1 cup and be sure all excess water drains away. Adjust as needed for your environment. Do not let the Snake Plant sit in water or overly soggy soil. The height at dispatch is approximately 14-inches tall, measured from the bottom of the pot to the top of the plant. The Snake Plant arrives in a 6-inch d\u00e9cor pot. To avoid water spillage, this container does not have holes. The Snake Plant is a moderate grower. Exact growth rate depends on the care provided and its environment. Give it a boost during the warm months of Spring and Summer with a general-purpose fertilizer that is formulated for potted plants. Follow the instructions on the fertilizer package for the best use. When the plant out grows the current container, it is time to repot. To repot the Snake Plant, gently remove it from its current container and place it into a slightly larger container. Fill in any empty spaces with new and fresh soil and water thoroughly. This plant is considered hardy in USDA Zone 9-11. Be aware of third-party sellers; other companies try to imitate our quality. There are no other authorized Costa Farms sellers. Plants are living things; each one is slightly different, so the plant you receive may vary from the photo. Our growers hand-pick the healthiest and highest-quality plants. We package our plants for delivery with great care so they'll arrive at your home ready to be displayed. Delivered fresh from our farm to you, Costa Farms is passionate about delivering happy, healthy, beautiful plants. Costa Farms plants are not intended for human or animal consumption. Keep out of reach of children and pets.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Totally Lovin' My New, Very Large, Attractive, Snake Plant!",
                "reviewText": "I just bought the Costa Farms Premium Sansevieria, Live Indoor Snake Plant, Ships in Decor Planter, 2-Feet Tall.I am so totally happy with my attractive new Snake Plant! I received one of the ones that has the variegated, gold edged leaves.My plant is tall! It actually measures 33 inches tall from the bottom of it's d\u00e9cor pot to the tip of the tallest leaf.The Plant arrived quicker than I had expected, and it was packaged quite well.The shipping box did sustain a bit of damage by UPS, but the Plant, and it's nice looking container inside, arrived with just a few tips bent on the Plant. The d\u00e9cor container did get a bit misshaped, but it went back into shape after a few hours out of that box in a warmer room.The Snake Plant was packaged very well, with plastic wrap pulled snug around the base of the Plant to about half way down the inner black pot, to keep most of the soil from spilling out. Then, the Plant and the black pot it is growing in, were put into a big, thick paper cone, which was then put into the d\u00e9cor pot.There was a long, sturdy bamboo stake in the black growing pot, right beside the Plant, to help keep the top of the box from being crushed into the Plant. That stake did appear to work very well because the box was damaged at the top and the stake was cracked, but the Plant did not get crushed and was pretty much fine except for a few bent tips.This Plant was also shipped with a decent sized disposable warmer, somewhat like one of those disposable pocket hand warmers.I live at the far north end of the Idaho Panhandle. Yesterday, when my Snake Plant arrived, it was snowing and around 31 degrees outside. I met the UPS guy at my door, so the Plant did not sit out on my porch at all. The box did feel quite cold, as the UPS trucks up here are not heated. But I believe that the heating pack that was shipped in with the Plant was warm enough, and lasted long enough, for the Plant to not be injured by the cold. The pack was still warm when I unboxed the Plant. The thick paper cone also helped to insulate the Plant too.So far my attractive new Snake plant looks to be in great condition! The soil was still fairly damp when I received it, so I did not water it yet.After letting this Plant sit in my kitchen sink for about 8 hours to slowly get back up to a decent temp, and for me to check for any hitch-hiking spiders, frogs or mice, the Snake Plant is now residing in my 64 degree bedroom, hopefully giving off some wonderful oxygen in there, which is why I bought the Snake Plant in the 1st place.Time will tell, but so far I am extremely happy with this Snake Plant and it appears that it was not damaged by it's cold winter ride to my home!I will certainly be buying more Plants from this Costa Farms!UPDATE 12/11/2021:After getting this 1st 2 Ft. Snake plant, I decided to order a 2nd one for my bedroom for extra oxygen. It also arrived safety last week, in the middle of a light snow storm here in North Idaho. It also had the heat packs and arrived undamaged and healthy. It's about as tall as the 1st one and it is just as beautiful. I am so happy with these pretty Snake Plants. These Plants sure do not remind me of Snakes. They actually remind me of underwater Kelp.UPDATE 03/15/2022:Both of my 2 foot tall Snake Plants in their d\u00e9cor pots are doing very well. One is in my bedroom, giving me oxygen at night and beauty during the day. The other one was supposed to also go in my bedroom, but it looks so nice in the living-room that I have just kept it there. So, now I am back to buy a 3'd large Snake Plant. I am super happy with these plants.UPDATE 08/10/2023:Both of my 2 foot tall Snake Plants are still doing fantastic! They have even grown another 1.5 inches tall and have had young shoots pop up to fill the pots more.I did buy another of these 2 foot tall snake plants, but it got quite abused during transit with UPS and arrived in less that desirable condition with half the plant missing and loose soil all in the box! It looks like the plant had come out of it's box, and was yanked out of it's pot! Someone roughly stuffed it back in its pot and lost a large portion of it. And then they repackaged the plant upside down in it's box, so it traveled upside down the rest of the way to my home.I contacted Costa farms and they sent out a replacement, but that one also got abused. I think UPS delivery persons may dislike delivering plants in winter. Anyway, it and the one it replaced are still alive, but they had a lot of damage and are not near as nice looking as my 1st 2 Snake plants.I think from now on I will buy smaller Snake Plants as those seem to survive shipping better that these tall ones. Anyway, I am still extremely happy with ALL may Snake Plants and I have been enjoying the wonderful oxygen they produce for me in my bedroom. And yes, I do have a decent LED Grow light in there for them and it all works very well for me.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m updating my bad review! I have now received 4 snake plants from this company. Three of these look really good and are flourishing. It was a great deal and came with a decorative plastic pot. Snake plants are so low maintenance and great at purifying the air! There was one plant that did not look good (it was ripped and some of the leaves were cut in half). I contacted customer service and at first heard no response, which is why I gave them a poor review. It took a few weeks, but I eventually did get a replacement plant that was in great shape. So 3 out of 4 great plants were great! And they fixed the problem and sent a replacement for the one that looked bad. Highly recommend!",

The other one is quite smashed up and I'm actually afraid it won't recover. The plants came frozen the weather was cold when delivered. Once opened and thawed the first plant is doing great. The second plant in the pictures is smashed up, soft, bent and I'm thinking it eill not recover and firm up.The leaves are completely bent and soft, not rigid like the first plant. I just hope it recovers and will thrive.",
