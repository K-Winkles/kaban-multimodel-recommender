The accent pillows they are covering are very dense and hight quality and I needed to order the same size as the pillows for that reason. Very Soft, lovely hand, stretched to fit the pillows, not see thru. Cost GREAT, 4, for little over the price of 2 of the same covers from another Amazon seller. Highly recommend, style is transitional and will likely order other colors for different seasons. Have fun!",

                "reviewText": "Bought to revamp 16inch throw pillows that are starting to fall apart and I don't want to keep on throwing in the washer as often, just want to extend the life of some throw pillows cause I am cheap, and my dog stinks everything up. I plan on putting these covers in the wash about every other week, and I don't see that as being a problem except for, while the zipper is metal and hidden which is GREAT, but I have a feeling I am going to tear it off with repeated use, user error or cheap zipper idk, they just don't zip smoothly for me.They are fairly soft, definitely softer than the pillows originally were, and don't appear to shed, but they also aren't 'sooo luxurious' like some people are saying when I was glancing over the reviews, lol. They are exactly like I expected.....nice especially for the price.The pillows fit in snuggly, which is actually great, but with taking the pillows in and out every other week.....I just know I am gonna get annoyed. The zipper doesn't go from corner to corner, rather about an inch or two short from each side making it hard to slip the pillow in with bad hands. Maybe if you didn't have chronic pain you'd be fine and wouldn't think about it, but just writing my experience with them.Only ONE ACTUAL compliant, and why I am taking the time to bother writing this review...the colors aren't as bright as the pictures. I thought maybe it was my phone, but someone else had the same complaint, so if you are really picky about the color I would warn you especially the pinky/coral color one is more of just a cream color with a bit an orange undertone. I was a bit disappointed cause I was hoping it would look more like a pink salt lamp, lol. Still nice neutral colors, and I know not to get too picky about colors online, but I bring it up, cause I really was expecting one to look dull coral/pink and thought at first I got the wrong colors it was soooooo off to me. I would take a picture but, it might skew it too, so I will leave it saying the 'pink' one is the most misleading, and I don't think it's on purpose just one of those things.",
