                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Easy to assemble, lightweight, not tacky looking, great size & price",
                "reviewText": "Definitely a great purchase. No regrets. Took me about 30 mins to assembleI was originally reluctant to buy this product because many of the reviews mentioned the assembly to be a real pain, but I liked the price and how it looked, (especially from pictures other reviewers posted), so I decided to try it and I am very satisfied with this product.Great size, especially for the price & it doesn\u2019t look tacky. The way the little plastic connectors blend in with the color of the wood is a really nice touch. I honestly would have been okay with the plastic pieces being white/black or just obviously a piece of plastic, as I care more about functionality than looks, so that\u2019s a nice detail.It\u2019s very lightweight and it\u2019s easy to move around without becoming flimsy or wobbly. If it does, then your plastic connectors are probably not fully snug.Definitely use the gloves that come with this product during assembly for a couple reason. My main reason for using them is to protect yourself from potential splinters, not that I got any during the assembly, but this product is made of wood and you\u2019re required to hammer each piece into its corresponding connections, so therefore, potential for splinters. Just a safety precaution.Also, the gloves are kind of mesh like (in a sense) so some of the black stuff still got my hands during the assembly process, but it easily washed away with soap and water. I did notice a faint lingering smell on my hands that went away in about an hour (smell was from how wood was treated, normal & expected), but I would suggest also using disposable gloves in addition to the gloves that come with this product if concerned or sensitive to smells.The other reason for the gloves is to protect your hands from getting black and dirty (due to how wood was treated).This took me about 30 mins to put together. Incredibly faster than I was anticipating as many of the reviews mentioned the assembly process to be a pain and take a long time. Product comes with a little mallet hammer that works well for for this assembly. I thought I might need to use a more heavy duty mallet or hammer but I did not, what came with this was perfect. I was weary the fact this product only uses plastic connectors instead of a screw but it\u2019s sturdier than expected. Definitely took way less time to assemble than any kind of allen wrench screw assembly. This was not stressful to put together.My advice for assembling, first make sure the plastic connectors are oriented correctly, because once you get those little connectors snug with the wood, it\u2019ll be very difficult to take off. (Picture)Also, because you\u2019re required to use the mallet to hammer each piece snug into place, I highly suggest attaching both sides of shelves before hammering tightly in place. And if connectors don\u2019t connect, the plastic piece is not snug enough on the wood. This is not difficult to assembly nor does it take a long time, if you struggle, it\u2019s very likely you didn\u2019t hammer the wood into the connector far enough.Also would like to mention, this product comes with 3 extra wood pieces (small, medium, large) and 2 extra plastic connectors- I did not need them but I\u2019m assuming they\u2019re included in the event one of the wood pieces or connectors splits/breaks during assembly.It\u2019s a great size and I\u2019m very happy with this product, especially for the price! I can\u2019t comment on it\u2019s longevity as I have not had this very long, nor can I say much about the weight limits, but it\u2019s much more supportive/sturdy than expected! (See picture with plants)Worth mentioning that the picture with the plants, all the planters are made of terracotta, ceramic and the 2 small brown are plastic. So that\u2019s a good amount of weight in total being placed in this product. Unit does not sway or feel wonky with plants, surprisingly doesn\u2019t seem wonky without plants too (even with 15 mph wind in Texas according to the weatherman).I probably have too much weight in total being used on this product but it\u2019s holding strong. I ended up buying a second one because I liked it so much. I would definitely recommend this product.If you\u2019re looking for something bigger and for heavier plants, or even just expanding after this, I would suggest looking at heftier and larger products, note with that, comes a higher price tag, but otherwise, this product is a solid purchase, 5 stars. 5 stars especially because the product description tells you everything without any surprises.Hope this review helps you!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Plant shelf",
                "reviewText": "I bought this so my plants could be spread out more than they were and be closer to the window. I always intended it to be an inside shelf. I\u2019m not sure if I like it blocking my windows the way it is but it\u2019s fine for now. There was some operator error in the assembly of this so I don\u2019t recommend building it while you\u2019re tired. We\u2019re calling it creative liberty because I\u2019m not taking it back apart anytime soon\ud83d\ude05 I was skeptical it was the right size unit because it was a suspiciously small box but apparently they just know witchcraft, I mean, how to pack things correctly. I thought this had 17 shelves but it is 14 with some open areas for tall or hanging plants. I just repotted my hanging plant into a floor pot so I don\u2019t know how useful this is for hanging plants or how heavy they can be. I also missed the part where they include gloves and tools but that hammer was handy when assembling this. The instructions were mostly easy to understand and follow if you\u2019re not half asleep and they have a helpful video you should watch before assembly and don\u2019t say \u201ceh, I\u2019ve got this, it\u2019s just simple push bars into connectors\u201c. One step told me to build one of something and then four steps later I found out I needed two of them so why tell me to make one? I should have videoed assembling it because it was pretty funny. My kids helped and we had a good time with all our errors. I wanted the whole big plant home so I don\u2019t know if you can only assemble some parts and not others but I feel like there were a few steps when I could have just left it the way it was and not finished. The connectors on top have some holes like I could buy another set similar to this and stack it on top but it\u2019s already pretty tall, too much taller and I won\u2019t be able to water the plants, let alone get the plants up there. I think it\u2019s just for ease of assembly so you don\u2019t have to keep track of special pieces that are only for the top row. The slats are about an inch and a half apart so no super small pots. It transferred carbon all over my hands when I was taking it out of the box so I used gloves to assemble it and so far it\u2019s not rubbing off on the curtains but I didn\u2019t think it would come off on my hands either. It washed right off my hands with soap and water. Some reviews said it didn\u2019t come off their wood at all, some did, I couldn\u2019t tell you why mine did. I had four extra pieces, one connector and one of each size bar. I have 14 plants currently on it of varying sizes and weights but it\u2019s sturdy enough to hold it all and it\u2019s not sagging I can definitely put more on it, I still have open spots. The shelves are big enough to fit three or four pots depending on how big they are. I have four pots on one shelf. Two small 4 inch pots, one two inch pot and one medium 6 inch pot and there is still room for more. The open slats allow for airflow and good sun exposure. I don\u2019t water any plants in that room I bring them all to a sink and water them let them drip and then bring them back so there\u2019s no water to see if it would damage the shelves. I don\u2019t know what kind of wood it is, I assumed it was bamboo or something similar but I also thought it had 17 shelves so clearly I can\u2019t be trusted to make assumptions or to look at all the pictures. I put plants where I wanted them to be and how much light they would get, not how heavy it would make one side or another and the shelf isn\u2019t unbalanced or going to tip over, it seems sturdy. Overall I like the concept, it would have been easier to assemble if my brain was working correctly at the time but even so it was only about an hour, it looks nice, it has plenty of space, and it\u2019s big. I would definitely buy it again. If I need another plant shelf in the future I\u2019ll probably buy another one of these. I just hope the black stops coming off it at some point and doesn\u2019t get on my curtains.May 17, 2023 update: can confirm this will hold a 30 pound tiny human on a shelf, plus all the plants and won\u2019t tip over while said tiny human climbs in and out of the \u201cgreat hiding spot\u201d. Don\u2019t recommend trying that out but you do you. I have also added more plants so almost every shelf has multiple pots I think I\u2019m up to 24 plants on it plus still some open spaces. The bottom shelves don\u2019t get enough light for most of my plants so keep that in mind when deciding if this works for you. Either place it so everywhere gets the light you need, get a plant light or put dark loving plants down there. Still love this so much. Great purchase.August 2023 update: y\u2019all, I bought another one! I now have two of these and so much room for plants I need more plants \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019m up to 25 plants across the two shelves and plenty of open space for more. I also got a plant light to go along with it. Few minor differences between this package and the last, these connectors actually do say \u201cup\u201d, I still had extra parts but I ended up needing the extra part because one of the short bars was too thin to fit into the connectors, and it really was faster to build this time probably because I\u2019ve already done it and knew the general idea. THIS time it\u2019s built correctly \ud83d\ude05 Black still came off on my hands and the gloves and it\u2019s still packaged with witchcraft. Black is still coming off the first shelf but only when you grab it and apply pressure not just brush up against it. I moved the shelves so they\u2019re side by side on a different wall. I\u2019ll add pictures of the second shelf too (don\u2019t mind the empty spaces I took this opportunity to water most of my plants). Sturdy fantastic shelves",

                "reviewText": "\"I purchased the wooden indoor Multiple Plants 3 Tiers Plant holder for 7 plant pots two years back. I must say I'm impressed. It has exceeded my expectations in several ways. Firstly, the craftsmanship is impeccable. The wood is of high quality and has a smooth finish, giving the stand a polished look. The design is sleek and modern, adding a touch of elegance to my indoor space.Assembly was straightforward, with clear instructions provided and all necessary hardware was included. They provided small size gardening tools, gloves and a hammer to fix the stand. For connecting the wood pieces plastic connectors are provided. They are good in quality.What I love most about this plant stand is its functionality. With three tiers, it provides ample space to showcase my plants. The design adds a unique touch to my indoor decor, and the arrangement of the pots is visually appealing. Additionally, the stand is sturdy, lightweight and well-balanced, giving me confidence that my plants are secure. If the plant pots are smaller, we can keep more than seven pots on the stand.Overall, I highly recommend this plant stand for anyone looking to elevate their indoor greenery space.",
