(And my dining room:) Have adimired this style fixture for years, I seem to have champagne tastes with beer wallet, so when I saw this on Amazon, I was like \"YES!\" I was all set to press the order key, when I saw the ad for used fixtures pop up. After reading many reviews about people who purchased used lights, (I'm a fan of reading other's reviews, just usually don't write them myself) it was something I was willing to try. Fixture was in like new box, plastic, etc. Can't even tell where used comes in to play, and my electrician husband hung easily, day before house full of guests. Room is 10x10, with a bay window. Light is classy, simple and not overpowering. I do recommend a dimmer switch if you can put one in. That is next on my honey-to-do list. My guests loved the light and was easy to install.",

It is made well and nice to look at. It is not large which is what I was looking for.I have bought inexpensive cloth shades/paper shades to dress it up. For Christmas I wove some authentic looking white pine roping at the base of it and it looked very cozy. I like the loop at the bottom because I can also dangle a prism from it if I like.It also looks very nice as it is. However, its simplicity allows you to do a lot of neat things with it.",

Not very busy, so if you looking for something elegant, yet simple, this is a good choice.My only negative aspect of this was the chain link adjustment. Sure I can open the link with pliers and close it back up, but you can aslo chip the finish on the links. Maybe they could supply one master link type link. I know ideally you only set it up once, but incase you had to move it up or down at times, you would have a fairly simple option.I'm happy with it.",

I read the newspaper and do my paperwork at the kitchen table. The saucers (?) under each light are too large for that purpose. They throw too much shadow on my reading. They are so noticeable that I placed glass globs in each one. It looked nice. In my dining room I have a similar chandelier. The saucers don't matter on that as I never need to read at that table.",
