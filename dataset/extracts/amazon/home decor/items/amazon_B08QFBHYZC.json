It does need to be \"fluffed\" a bit after unboxing, but it's very easy to manipulate the wire branches, and it ends up being a lovely little wreath - exactly as pictured. I'm very pleased with this purchase!",

The branches look very realistic and I love the contrast of white berries mixed in with the eucalyptus leaves.It did require about 20 minutes of fluffing and the main circular frame was a little mis-shapen on first arrival but it could easily be bent back into what it was supposed to be.I really enjoy the wreath against the white kitchen cabinets. It is a must buy, you won\u2019t regret it!",
