These make the perfect amount of accent light. It works as a little \"nightlight\" or just a decor accent. The timer on the remote is a big plus. While guests are over we can have the lights on for the right amount of time and don't have to worry about forgetting to turn them off. The flowers are a little more of a cream color, but still fantastic and very pretty. They are fake, yes. But they complete the look of this item well. I will be able to easily switch out the flowers for different colors during the holidays, then put the original right back in. The battery pack sits in a specific are on the back of the wooden design, out of sight. Easy to swap the batteries when needed. These sconces would look good in any room of the house! Great value, great item and I would recommend them!",

                "reviewText": "I love these! I somehow overlooked the fact that there are two in each purchase, so I ordered two sets! One of the sets has a remote that doesn't work at all, so I'm taking off a star for that dissatisfaction. The remote is needed to set the timer, so, luckily, my mistake gave me two remotes, and the other one does work. I would've had to contact the company or exchange the product, if I didn't get a working remote. I like that I can choose a 2, 4, 6, or 8 hour timer.These sconces are more beautiful in person! I ordered the grey, and they have the rustic wood look that I love!I purchased navy, hydrangea flowers from Amazon, and added one bunch to each jar, to match my decor. A couple of the cream flowers, which come with this item, fell off, while assembling, but they are very easy to put back on.The lights add a nice, nighttime ambiance to the bathroom, and provide enough lighting to see while using the room. A couple of the settings are similar. There are a couple of strobe settings, which I hate, and could be a concern for anyone prone to seizures. It's great to have a permanent on option, also.Overall, the sconces are classy, rustic, farmhouse decor. Even though I originally only wanted 2 sconces, I'm keeping the four that I purchased! These are giftable (assuming the remote works).",

Runs off batteries which saves on my electrical bills and the timer feature is a plus. With the low voltage on the mini lights I won't have to replace the batteries for months.

You need to put 3 batters in each (double A) but there is a timer on them so they go off automatically after 6 hours. I put them on at 5 when we have dinner then they go off at 11 when we go to bed. Perfect. You can also manually turn them off and on as well. Love them.",
