                "reviewText": "It isn't wood, but it sure looks like wood until you plug it in, and the characters light up, as if looking into the wood. It's accurate, large easy-to-read numbers.Numbers are a nice blue color, with great brightness adjustment - my last clock, I'd turn off the bedroom lights, and the clock's red numbers were airport runway lights...I could read a book by that light. This one I can turn the brightness way down...still easy to see, but not, you know - \"WAKE UP!\" Sound adjustment is good, too.Only one minor complaint, setting (or resetting) the time and alarm-time isn't all that intuitive. There are a bunch of buttons on the top edge of the back-side, and you need to push combinations of buttons that you can't see to do simple tasks. It's not like you need a college degree or anything, but it might have been made simpler.Bottom line? A very good clock, good looking, very adjustable, and a decent price (which I note has come down a couple bucks since I bought mine).",

                "reviewText": "We wanted a bedroom clock that was lit numbers (as opposed to back lit) and that was aesthetically pleasing. This clock is great! If you look really closely it's kind of fake wood, but certainly passing in a room it doesn't look fake. The numbers are very large (bordering on too large?) but the feature of variable brightness was a really nice feature. The controls on the back are very easy to use and it's nice that it has a USB charging port so you're not sacrificing an outlet for charging your phone. Great buy!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Mostly a good, attractive clock, with a few small annoyances",
                "reviewText": "The Good:The clock is mostly attractive, as well as unusual in appearance, with a triangular body and a wood-like finish. While not actual wood, it has a nice wood like appearance, and the numbers show through the wood grain. You don't see any holes in the wood grain for numbers that are off.There are five brightness settings, making it easy to find settings that work day and night. I can easily read the clock across the room during the day, and set it dim enough that it doesn't bother me at night. Unfortunately, I find that my preferred daytime setting is 3 and night time is 2, so if I don't want to change it, it is either slightly too dim in bright sunlight, or slightly too bright at night. But the clock is usable at both settings at all times. One well designed feature is the brightness button is the leftmost button, so it is easy to adjust the brightness in the dark. I would have preferred a clock with a light sensor and an automatic dimmer.The controls are easy to use, and the buttons are easy to press. Unlike most digital clocks, there are + and - buttons for adjusting the time, so you don't need to go all the way around to set the clock back, (and don't have to worry about going too far, and needing to cycle again!)There is a battery backup. While the display turns off when the power is out, the time does come back when the power comes back.The alarm seems to work. Since I generally use my phone as an alarm, I haven't done much testing.After a week, the clock appears to keep time well.The Bad:There does not appear to be a low battery indicator. I guess I'll find out when the batteries are low after a power fail. Furthermore, without the battery, the clock resets to midnight and doesn't flash, so if it happens to reset near midnight, the clock could be wrong, but I wouldn't know it. I don't know how long the batteries last, but if I want to rely on it, I'll need to test the batteries every so often.I like to set my clocks accurately. Generally, when I set a digital clock, I'll set the last minute just as the minute ticks over on my phone. For this clock, the time set mode times out after 15 seconds, so I have to be carefully when setting the time exactly. Furthermore, the + button is also the alarm on button (when not in time setting mode), so if I'm not careful, I can accidentally turn on the alarm.The power cord is a bit on the short side. I keep my clock on a chest of drawers, and it won't reach to the front.The Ugly:The snooze button is a touch sensitive spot on the top of the clock unlike the other physical buttons. This is a good feature; however, it is indicated by a large painted on button with a pointing finger. It is rather cartoon like. (You can see it in one of the pictures.) For a clock that is otherwise attractive this is a blemish.Despite its minor faults, I'm generally happy with the clock.",
