I tried it with very around cups, slim square cups, slim round ones, and they all stayed balanced on the coasters so that was nice. I also liked the variety of colors in a gradient, just a little personal preference of mine due to my OCD is that I wish there wasn't a double of the dark green and one for the rest of the colors. That's just me.I haven't had to clean these yet so I don't know if they're dishwasher safe or can handle super hot tempatures.",

                "reviewText": "Baby it's cold outside--and while I wouldn't hesitate to sit a cup of hot chocolate on these coasters outdoors, we use them indoors, as we constantly keep glasses or water bottles available. I wanted something that would catch drips or condensation from our drinks, and these do just that. The sides and patterned 'wells' in the molded silicone contain any drips and keep the furniture dry. They stay put and don't slide around, so I have actually used them on the wide arms of my leather furniture to keep my phone from sliding off. Because the pattern is multi-dimensional, the coasters can be used on the flip side which is fairly flat, with a slightly elevated broken line pattern. However, there are no 'wells' to capture spills, so keep that in mind. I like that the neutral colors and generic pattern do not distract from other decor. These coasters are flexible and not at all flimsy. Because they are silicone I expect they will last a long time.",

As some of the tables or chair arms are wood, I was worried about \"sweat\" yet these are recessed enough (the design in them is raised) so glass sweat should stay captured within the coaster.Being vinyl/rubber, I would net leave them out at all times as the sun may make them brittle as would ice potentially do so. I don't intend to leave mine out yet saw that as a possibility.Overall, I'm please. Now, to get more!",
