They\u2019re priced well, made very well, and hold liquids. They retain heat, so the underside doesn\u2019t get hot meaning that your furniture stays nice and cool and dry- no condensation or moisture from hot or cold liquids. I have ordered them multiple times. The color choices are nice, too. The size is generous. The video shows my 32 ounce Hydroflask on top of it. It accommodates oversized soup mugs nicely, too.",
