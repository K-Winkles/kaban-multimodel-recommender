They have multiple light settings and the timer was nice to aviod leaving them on all night. They are bright and easy to hang. They have connector pieces making it easy to connect multiple strands together. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I've read others complained that this can be a tangled mess, and I understand why. Mine was neatly packed, as each of the strings was nicely folded and tied. I watched a video of someone else putting theirs up and followed what they did. I plugged it in to make sure it worked, then I slowly unraveled only the main string, leaving all the other strings still tied. I then strung up the main string on the curtain rod, and adjusted it to how I liked it. After it was secured, I then slowly untied and unraveled each string of lights. Nothing was tangled and it was easy to put up!I'll probably try to do the reverse when I want to pack it away, but for now I love how it looks and the hygge vibe it gives me. Most nights it's the only light I leave on and it's so lovely! The different light settings are great too, but I generally leave it on the twinkle setting as it's my favorite.I'm tempted to buy a second set so I can have the lights span the entire window length.",

                "reviewText": "The directions were a bit confusing at first, took us a second to figure out how to change the settings. Finally discovered the small little button on the power box. We didn't have an issue with tangles at all, we simply left each strand wrapped the way they came until we were ready to unravel them! We were very excited to discover that we could cut to make them shorter. As you can see in the picture, my daughter had a very specific location that she wanted the lights to go which required them to be much shorter. After unplugging them from the power supply, we cut off about 4 ft and they still worked perfectly. The only thing holding me back from rating these as a five star, is that there isn't an easy way to turn them off. You have to unplug them completely, which requires unscrewing the cord cover, or unplugging from the outlet on the wall (which is not convenient when the outlet is in a hard to reach location). If If these came with a wireless remote control, they would definitely get all five stars from us! Very happy with our purchase overall, they truly change the look and feel of the entire room!",
