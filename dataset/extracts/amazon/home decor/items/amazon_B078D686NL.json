Their unforgettable performances as Dracula (Lugosi) and Frankenstein's monster (Karloff) terrified a generation of moviegoers, and when these two legendary actors combined their talents for a series of spine-tingling films in the 1930's, audiences could not get enough. The Boris Karloff & Bela Lugosi 4-Movie Horror Collection includes 4 of their most blood-chilling collaborations including The Black Cat, The Raven, The Invisible Ray and Black Friday.]]>",

                "reviewText": "A nice 4 film collection out of the 8 movies Bella and Karloff both featured together. All the movies are good but \"The Black Cat\" and the \"Invisible Ray\" are definitely the highlights of this quatro for me.It's really a shame Universal hasn't given \"The Black Cat\" a proper 4K Bluray restoration; as it's every bit as good, if not better than either \"Dracula\" or \"Frankenstein\" in showing the talents of both actors ... not to mention its infinitely more creepy, sinister, and darkly gothic.Both dvd discs played ok but they did act up with periodic tracking issues in my player, and I think the sound quality in \"The Black Cat\" was better in the Universal Vault Series dvd.",
