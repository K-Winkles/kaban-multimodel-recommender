The wooden base, metal body, and vintage glass shade? It's like the perfect decor piece that also makes your candles pop! And yup, it's a one-size-fits-all deal, so all your jars are welcome to the party. The adjustable height feature is a bonus. Plus, it's all about that top-down candle melt action \u2013 it spreads the fragrance like magic - and it seems like my candles last longer.My favorite feature: You can set a timer and dim the light (four different levels) to match your mood (and anyone close to me knows that I have MANY moods!).My OCD point: Safety's a big deal, and this warmer nails it. No more anxiety over open flames \u2013 it's all fire hazard-free. And those low-energy bulbs? Total eco-friendly vibes \u2013 no smoke or waste in sight. If there's one downside, it's that there are no hot firemen coming to the rescue. But hey, we can always fake-sigh about it, right? \ud83d\ude02Wrap up: the Candle Warmer Lamp with Dimmer is a solid player in the candle world. It's all about bringing style and safety to your space while keeping the candle vibes strong. If you're a candle addict like me, you NEED this lamp in your life \u2013 trust me, it's the real deal! \ud83d\udd6f\ufe0f\u2728",

                "reviewText": "got this initially because the price was so much cheaper than other top-down candle warmers but it's such a delight to have!!! the light itself isn't terribly bright so it's not distracting to have on, it helps the candle scent spread fast (maybe not faster than actually lighting it's), and even helps it burn evenly. the only issue im having, but i didn't take off a star because it might not be the device's fault, is that the wax is burning above the wicks so the wick gets lost in the wax and it A CHORE to get it back. other than that, im satisfied",

                "reviewText": "My wife loves this candle warmer. I lost my smell when I was 10 years old but my wife says it makes the house smell great, and it takes a really long time for the candle to completely melt. Weeks even if it's on 24/7. It also gives off a great amount of light, the controller portion has good functionality, timer 2, 4, 6 and I believe 8 hour timers, 4 light strength options which I find great before going to bed, I lower it 2 or 3 notches and it emits the perfect amount of light, at that point I click the 2 hour timer and don't have to worry about it. I think the quality is great and have had no issues with this thing. If you're looking for a candle warmer, I can recommend this one.",

You would imagine how shocked I was when I plugged it in for 5 seconds and the light bulb EXPLODED and shattered glass everywhere. In my shoes, ruined the candle and all in my carpet. I NEVER write reviews but this should come with safety goggles or life insurance if the light bulbs are going to explode within 5 seconds. and YES I followed the instructions.",

No more wasting candles as it only uses the light to activate the scent and the candle becomes solid again after each use. Plus, the aroma is just as strong as if you lit the candle. Will be ordering additional ones for my home as well!",
