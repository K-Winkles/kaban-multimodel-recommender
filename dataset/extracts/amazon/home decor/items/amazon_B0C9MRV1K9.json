They aren\u2019t as bright as anticipated, but they work nicely in our hallways, bathrooms, bedrooms and kitchen.The only negative is that the Dusk to Dawn sensor is not adjustable, and they will illuminate when not in direct sunlight. So they will be on in a shaded bedroom or bathroom during the day.They are LED and low usage, and will last for a long time, so If I have to replace them in a year or two, no biggie.*Under $20 for 8 devices. In addition to being nightlights, they are nice accent lights in dim rooms.",
