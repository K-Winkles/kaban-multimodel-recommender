This was a great little centerpiece during the fall and now sits nicely next to our hydroponic garden!Value is almost always the same across the board with all Lego sets due to how they price them, so it's exactly what you would expect. I would warn that there are a TON of very very small pieces, so if dexterity is an issue this set can be a struggle!",

It is very intricate and some pieces are tiny but the end product is just beautiful! It served as the centerpiece on our Thanksgiving dessert table and everyone was very complimentary and truly amazed. As long as you follow the directions step by step, it\u2019s not that difficult for a 10-14 year old, otherwise an adult may need to help. Look at the dimensions of the finished product so you will know the size.",
