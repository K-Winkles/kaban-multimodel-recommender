The lowest barely melts it, but I think it is my favorite setting, the candles last longer and I feel like the scent is more potent that way. The high setting melts it too fast, faster than if you were to burn the wick even. I personally believe this setting is too much, I like a slow melt.There are also 3 timer settings - 2h, 4h and 8h. Perfect for those like me, who tend to forget they have something on!The lamp is adjustable, I have fit some pretty tall candles with plenty of room to expand it still. Very lightweight, cam be a plus and a negative. Definately recommend putting somewhere away from kids and pets due to how light it is. I do like that it comes with an extra bulb too.",

It gives us complete control over how long we want our candles to warm up, creating a personalized experience. Beyond the convenience, it's a practical feature that brings energy-efficiency.Overall Impressions:Our experience with the lamp has surpassed our expectations. The fragrance seems more pronounced compared to using an open flame, and the candles melt in a way that adds an aesthetically pleasing touch. It's become an essential part of our home ambiance.",

I got the clear lamp one and it is absolutely beautiful in person! It seems to instantly warm up and I can smell the candle very quickly! The timer snd dimmer work perfectly! It definitely is a great addition to my room! It also came with two light bulbs. I can highly recommend this beautiful lamp!",

Am very disappointed, as this was a gift for my parents. Really hope they can make this right.***UPDATE***: After conferring with customer service, they were able to send me a new one, which works great! This was a gift for my parents, so we are all very thrilled with it's performance! It fills a room with its scent, and no flames either! Thank you so much",

I never have to worry about scents when guests come over (recently got flooded and noticed a moldy smell), and can switch fragrances with candles or essential oils as I wish whilst adding a nice light that adds to the room.Biggest plus: I don\u2019t use any chemical sprays anymore that don\u2019t last and are toxicSlight minus: I wish the head was retractable to either get closer to the candle or further.But in all, very good purchase, durable and efficient in many ways",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely loved this lamp. It works really well. It's beautiful, and added just what I was looking for to add to my kitchen/dining area. However, it runs through these bulbs like crazy! I got this in July, it is now December and I've had to replace the bulbs at least 3 times. I have a different candle warmer that I got last December and have yet to change the bulb in it. I leave them both on most of the day while I am home and they are both on their highest settings since the rooms they are in are large. I don't see anyone else complaining about this so maybe it is just mine? But i am afraid to get another one from this particular seller even though it is very tempting. The other designs are also very cute.",
