They hold all of my shower products without dropping, sagging, molding, breaking, or tarnishing. Two bottles of hair products, sugar scrub, body wash, my razor and my antimicrobial body scrubber all fit on one shelf. My only issue was that once the sticky strip that holds it up is on, you can't un-stick it. So, one of my shelves is crooked. Haha, it's my fault but just as a cautionary tale, make sure you have it level before you stick it to any surface. I love these shelves, and I will order again.",

This set of two large, rustproof shelves offers a practical and stylish storage solution.Firstly, the stainless steel design in black is both modern and sleek, fitting well with different bathroom decors. The size of the shelves is generous, providing ample space for all my shower essentials, from large shampoo bottles to smaller soap bars.The adhesive installation is a breeze and a huge plus for me. No drilling means no damage to tiles or walls, and the adhesive is surprisingly strong and reliable. The caddies have stayed firmly in place, even with heavier items stored on them.The rustproof feature is another bonus. They\u2019ve held up well in the humid environment of the shower without any signs of rust, maintaining their neat appearance.The only minor downside is that the adhesive, while strong, might not fare well on all surfaces. It\u2019s important to ensure your wall type is compatible and the surface is clean before installation.Overall, the Sakugi Adhesive Shower Caddy scores a solid 4 out of 5 stars. It\u2019s functional, stylish, and easy to install, making it a nearly perfect solution for bathroom organization. Just double-check your wall type for the best adhesive results!",

This was a great bargain and I put so much stuff on the two shelves and got everything off the bath surround. They provide some hooks as well to hang things. As you can see I'm drying my bath pillow. The most important thing is the great suction of the Taili shower grab bars I ordered through Amazon. Safety First! By the way this is an ugly bathroom that I will be redoing soon.",
