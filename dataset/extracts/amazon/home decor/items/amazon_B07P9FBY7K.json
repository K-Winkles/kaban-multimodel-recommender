                "reviewText": "I am a Floridian and I purchase from Costa Farms regularly here at different nurseries and often home depot, but over the years I've found that they are better quality, less expensive, and better cared for when ordering from their Amazon page. I may not be one to go by, especially since 5 to 7 day shipping typically only takes a day for me, but they are always perfection!THIS IS NOT NOT BOX THEY CAME IN! They were packed to prevent any damage and they were all able to breath and came with bamboo to hold each plant in place. I just transferred to this box for photo purposes.",

I kill every plant I'm ever given but I'm determined to improve my gardening skills because I love how they look in a house and I know they have some air cleaning properties as well.I found this trio of plants and decided to purchase it because 1) the price is great and 2) these plants are known to be good for a healthy home. They arrived in PERFECT condition, packed very well and most important, they're really cute. The pots they arrive in are plastic but they don't look cheap at all. In fact, these would make a great hostess gift or party favor. I appreciated that the seller includes written information about the plants including how to care for them.I've had them for a few weeks now and they are happily thriving and fingers crossed....I haven't killed them yet. I highly recommend these!",

                "reviewText": "Plants arrived in a tall box that said KEEP UPRIGHT, that was nice. I opened the box and each plant (6) had paper wrapping secured around each, with a bamboo stake, that was nice. The first pkg I opened, was the first image here, a Rex Begonia. It was clearly in very poor condition, in fact basically dead. I use an app called PictureThis; you take a pic of your plant and up pops all the information about it, its name how to care for it, and so on. The app itself read YOUR PLANT IS SICK .... I set it aside, unwrapped the 2nd plant, 2nd image. That is called Croton. All the plants were tightly wrapped with saran wrap, difficult to get access to the plant itself, all plants had the bamboo stake as mentioned, with the saran wrap wrapped around that too. The Croton was droopy, green leaves laying listless and the soil was dry. Gave it water right away. I could see it is an unusual plant, will be quite pretty when healthy. Went about unwrapping the rest, which were in pretty good condition, although the Golden Pothos (4th and 5th images) is SO root bound you can see the mound of roots sticking OUT of the pot! The 3rd plant/image is called Nerve Plant. The 6th image is a TREE! False Aralia grows 25 - 50 Feet HIGH and approx 7 feet around! It is on the Wild Endangered List and is not expected to survive - that makes this Aralia Tree very special to me. It also is root bound. But I intend on repotting all of them so, not really an issue. The last image is of Satin Pothos and as are the other, it also is quite root bound.For the poor Rex Begonia, I cut everything off, took it out the squashed pot, washed all the dirt away, and found there were actually 5 little plants. I repotted with Coir and Worm Castings and put in my quarantine sick bay. I sincerely hope it comes back to life. I feel the supplier, Costa Farms, should just send me a healthy Rex Begonia! It is a very pretty plant and I would like it for my inside garden.After or when, these plants settle themselves and grow, I'll provide an update. Thank you.",
