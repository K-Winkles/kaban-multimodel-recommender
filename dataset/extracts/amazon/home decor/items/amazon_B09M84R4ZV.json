            "\u2605Wondering how to keep rugs from slipping? This is a problem that troubles many people. To address it, we provide a new material which works as a rug pads gripper. This method uses VACUUM TECH design which grips all types of floors firmly and easily. Patent Pending.",
            "\u2605Design Feature. This product can easily be glued under any rug. The side facing the floor features tiny suction pores. These pores utilize the VACUUM TECH feature in which whenever pressure is applied from the top, air escapes and creates a low-pressure region within the cups. This produces an adhesive effect, which keeps your rug in place. Does Not Work For Rugs On Carpet Floors.",
            "\u2605Advantages. The rug anti curling gripper is less than 1/10 inch thick and inconspicuous after installing. Suction technology firmly sticks to the floor without causing marks or damage, and the gripper easily peels off the floor. It is convenient to wash, as you won\u2019t have to separate it from your carpet for cleaning. The tape for rug adds extra comfort underfoot owing to the slightly bouncy nature of suction technology.",
            "\u2605Components. This package includes 16 pieces. Each piece is square in order to increase the surface area in contact with the floor. That leaves your kitchen, bathroom, and hallway much more secure. You can even use them outdoors to prevent slipping and flatten corners.",
            "\u2605A 1-YEAR Money Back accompanies this product. This ensures that your rug remains securely in place, and helps to prevent accidental slips and falls. If you are not satisfied, send us a message and we will make a refund without any question."

My pets had this thing sliding around all day until I bought these. They didn't seem like much more than a foam pad so I didn't have a lot of hope but they hold so well! They didn't really have adhesive on the floor side of the pad which is what i wanted..I don't want stickers on my new floors.They are not re-usable. Once you peel it up, it will not stick back down. Found that out with aggressive vacuum maneuvers haha. Also if they get real wet, they peel up and don't stick back down.. found that out thanks to the dog.Good news is, they removed easily and didn't damage our leave residue on my floor!",

Every time I vacuumed the rugs would move around on the hard floor. When my puppy played in the house, the rugs turned into a slip and slide and ended up all over the house.I put one square in each corner of the rug, and just like magic, the rugs stay in place. My puppy is now a 50lb adorable monster, and even he can't get them to slide across the floor.After using these for around 4 months, they had gotten dusty and when I readjusted them, they didn't stick back down. I wiped each square with a wet paper towel, and they worked again just like new!I think I'll get another set!",

This was really frustrating, I also struggled fixing the problem sooner then I could have as I don\u2019t like the pad versions that go under the whole area. Needless to say, after a lot of researching I found that they made ones exclusively for the corners (laugh if you will). Admittedly, the reviews caught my eye, but mostly the price: reasonable (with the sale).I figured, why not give it a try!I was thrilled to see how easy, non-invasive, and efficient they were, and they absolutely are machine washable, because with tremendous fear I went and tried it and they stuck just fine, still look great, and work like a charm! I have no issues with them whatsoever, you\u2019d have to apply a great deal of intentional force to get your rug to move with them, so I can\u2019t recommend enough. Honestly, get asap.UPDATE: As of recently, they did start to slip and I will need to order new ones. I still want to give a good review being that they held up for so long, but once they\u2019re gone they\u2019re gone. No reviving",

                "reviewText": "I purchased these about 7 months ago. I Like how they don\u2019t leave sticky residue marks on the floor if moving the rugs,held well for 6 months and are quite flat so it doesn\u2019t raise the corners of the rugs that would cause tripping hazard BUT they have started not staying in place and a few that are staying in place, come off the rugs if I move the rug to mop. They worked great for 6 months and the last 2 months almost all the hold has gone out of them. I was just going to replace them until I saw the price and at $2 apiece I feel it is time to look at using the guarantee.",

                "reviewText": "We bought these for the rug in my daughter's playroom. Part of the floor is tile, and I wanted something soft to land on. I bought these to make sure the rug doesn't move around. I was shocked at how well they grip the tile! It can create a tripping hazard if you don't have the rug pulled taut, but so far, it has been great. The rug hasn't moved an inch and the corners stay down without issue.",

                "reviewText": "This review is not meant to encourage anyone to buy a portable toilet riser. My review is meant to focus on this rug gripper, using it for an optional purpose. Although the latest portable riser we just purchased does not actually need adhesion to the toilet rim and because of its universal compatibility with slightly different sized toilets, we decided to purchase a thin, non-slip, double-adhesion tab just to give a slightly more secure feel. All other portable risers come with tabs adhering to the underside of the strong plastic riser, except the latest one we purchased. (But we chose this latest riser anyway after comparing and considering everything.) This gripper for rugs is perfect because it can be cut to any size. The gripper must adhere to a few strategic spots on the underside of the riser and it must adhere to corresponding spots on the toilet rim. The claim is that it's strong and cannot be easily removed (this is a good thing in this particular scenario). The only thing that's necessary when needing to be cleaned is to pull up the entire riser in one step to loosen it from the rug grippers. Not difficult to do.",

                "reviewText": "The wood floors in my house were laid on top of tile floors by the previous owner which means that I have major issues with my exterior door thresholds and I\u2019ve had to try several solutions to deal with the drafts while still being able to have a rug for dirty shoes. The best option I\u2019d found for the drafty doors was really fighting with my rug that had corners that refused to lay flat. It was constantly catching the corner making it nearly impossible to get in and out of the house. I\u2019d bought a new flatter rug, but that didn\u2019t have rubberized backing to keep it in place (despite that being part of the product description). However, with these floor grippers, the carpet problem is solved! I just placed them as close to the corners as possible and the rug stays in place. What I liked about this product over other similar ones, is this isn\u2019t a rug tape. It basically works like a suction cup, and because the rug is only 3x5, I can pick it up to mop underneath and put the rug back once the floor is dry. I also look forward to trying the vacuum on it. If you have a similar quirk you\u2019re dealing with, give these a try!",
