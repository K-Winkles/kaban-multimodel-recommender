                "reviewText": "I recently got the this Jewelry Box, and it has effortlessly become a staple on my dresser. Here are a few things I absolutely love about it:- Sophisticated Appearance: The design is truly eye-catching. The combination of graphite black and silver gives it a modern and elegant touch that complements my room decor.- Value for Money: Given its high-quality build and finish, the price point is more than reasonable. It's not often that you find such quality at this price.- Spacious and Versatile: The box is deceptively spacious. With multi compartments tailored for various types of jewelry, organization has become a breeze. The added bonus of two drawers, each of a different size, ensures that both my chunkier and more delicate pieces have a safe home.- Perfect for Dresser Display: Its size and design make it perfect to sit atop a dresser. The glass lid is not just functional but adds to its aesthetic appeal, allowing a sneak peek into the treasures inside.All in all, this jewelry box by SONGMICS is a gem in itself. Whether you're looking for something functional, aesthetically pleasing, or both, this ticks all the boxes. Highly recommended!",

Very Pottery Barn looking (and maybe this is the pb supplier, idk). The drawer pulls all the way out, so you get more space than you think in that section. Make sure to look at the dimensions. It was a little smaller than I was expecting. Very perfect!",

Nothing was bulky but I still have room for more earrings and plenty of ring space.",
