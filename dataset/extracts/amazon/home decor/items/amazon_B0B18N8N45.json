                "reviewText": "These are real preserved eucalyptus leaves. They will arrive very dried out and squished. What I did was fill my kitchen sink with hot tap-water and soaked them, and then gently massaged and worked the leaves into a fluffy more natural position. This works!As for people complaining about color being an artificial and die dripping on the shower. It\u2019s not that they added artificial color during the preserving process\u2026 That color is actually the preservative used. It is harmless, does not stain, and easily rinses away. It\u2019s noticeable while soaking and rinsing them prior to bundling them back to hang.The only negative I have to say is, I was disappointed that the smell is so very faint. Even when working with the leaves in the hot kitchen water, the smell was not very noticeable.Beautiful though\u2026 and what I plan to do is spray the leaves with eucalyptus essential oil mist to bring the scent intensity up.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the \"Natural Eucalyptus\" product with high hopes of bringing a touch of nature into my bathroom. Unfortunately, my experience has been far from satisfactory.To begin with, the product is advertised as \"natural,\" but upon closer inspection, it's evident that the eucalyptus has been treated with green-blue coloring. This artificial enhancement not only contradicts the claim of being natural but has also caused significant issues.The green coloring in the eucalyptus has bled onto my white bathroom tiles, leaving unsightly stains that are difficult to remove. It's disheartening to see the impact on the aesthetic of my bathroom, especially considering the product was supposed to enhance the space, not mar it.Moreover, the product leaks excessively, creating a mess in my bathroom. The leaking issue has added an extra layer of inconvenience, requiring constant cleanups and further contributing to the discoloration of the tiles.I am thoroughly disappointed with the misleading advertising and the negative impact this product has had on my bathroom. I would strongly advise against purchasing the \"Natural Eucalyptus\" if you are looking for a genuinely natural product that won't damage your surroundings.I hope this review serves as a cautionary note for others considering this product.Unhappy Customer",

These branches have added a lovely touch to my living space, bringing a touch of nature indoors.However, I must express my disappointment with the shipping experience. The packaging left much to be desired. The branches were not adequately protected, and as a result, some arrived with minor damage. While the product itself is top-notch, the shipping process left me feeling less than satisfied.In summary, the Preserved Dried Eucalyptus Branches are a quality product that I would recommend to anyone seeking to add a natural element to their decor. Just be prepared for a potentially less-than-ideal shipping experience.",

So, like with other dried branches we've had I rolled them to work the oil out. That's when I realized the leaves had a weird sheen/feel to them. I gave it a chance and hung them in my shower and....nothing. Absolutely nothing! No scent, no change in appearance to the leaves, nothing. Well, I take that back, there was a lovely green \"paint like\" residue that left a stain. The other thing that made me question the materials was the grammatically incorrect story wrapped around my bundle about the owners husband and children being sick and that whole thing. Oddly enough it was the same letter we got from another vendor not that long ago. Same paper and everything!",
