                "reviewText": "These did have some fingerprints on them out of the packing, and wiping that away with a microfiber cloth wasn't exactly easy around the decorative frames, but it did give me a chance to appreciate just how reflective and clear the mirror glass is. These are the kind of perfect clarity that can trick you into thinking a reflection is real- and the glass had no dings or scratches at all. The frames are wooden, which I definitely love over cheap plastic, though the wood grain does show and that might bother some people. The backs are sturdy board, and the nail hanging brackets protrude just enough to catch a good hold, but not so much so that they make the mirrors tilt forward, and I really liked that they have \"teeth\" for adjusting them, as in, if one is tilting crooked you can move it over on the nail by a tooth space to balance it.The weight of these is quite light, and even in my kind of thin walls a regular small nail each was plenty to get them on the wall safely. The charm they add above my bookcase immediately elevated my decor to \"wow\" factor, I am absolutely in love with how stylish and nice quality these are! I am so happy I got these, and I would recommend them absolutely! 5-stars!!",
