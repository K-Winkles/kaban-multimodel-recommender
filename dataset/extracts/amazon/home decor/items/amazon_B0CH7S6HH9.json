That being said, even though it\u2019s plastic, the reflection on this IS THE BEST I\u2019VE EVER purchased. The quality of the plastic reflection is GREAT!! I was very surprised once installed which took 3 seconds. I\u2019m amazed how clear the view is!! It\u2019s like shaving in a REAL mirror. Highly recommend this product. PS: my old one needed to be filled up with hot water prior to using. Not this item! Wife even stated that she took a very hot shower & the room was steamed up but the mirror was clear, she was shocked. I\u2019d definitely purchase this if you are thinking about it. Oh and I like the razor holder which is better than my previous one which had a tray that would move & fall when using sometimes. This tray just snaps in a bit. Easy on/off to clean all parts.",

I recently moved to a new place and needed a new shower so I bought several Lan Amazon and tried them all out. This one did not make the cut. I personally would recommend this one instead: https://amzn.to/3POuIefIf you'd like to hear my thoughts on this one, keep reading!\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\udddf\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf8 \ud835\uddea\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude00 \ud835\udde3\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4, \ud835\uddd5\ud835\ude02\ud835\ude01 \ud835\udde7\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\udde4\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01\ud835\ude06 \ud835\uddd9\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf9 \ud835\udde6\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude01I was really hoping to fall in love with this shower mirror - its sleek design, minimalistic aesthetic, and nifty razor holder along with the little shelf had me at hello. It seemed to promise a neat, clutter-free shaving experience. But alas, the honeymoon phase didn't last long.\ud835\uddd4 \ud835\uddea\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf1 \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfbUpon closer inspection, it was clear that the mirror suffered from a major flaw - the quality of the reflection. Unlike some higher-end models that use glass, this one seemed to have settled for a cheaper plastic film which, unfortunately, is prone to warping. The inconsistent distortion in the reflection, especially in the middle part, was not just distracting but quite nauseating while shaving. It\u2019s a mirror, the reflection should be the least of the concerns, but here we are. And yes, I removed the protective film, that wasn't the issue.\ud835\uddd4 \ud835\udddb\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfb \ud835\udde6\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf3, \ud835\uddd4 \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4 \ud835\udddc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfbOne thing I noticed was a lot of the other reviews mention that the mini shelf and razor holder is missing or was missing when they got the product. I also noticed that it was missing it first but I realized that it isn't missing, its just hiding in an inconspicuous spot. It's packed in the back of the mirror itself, I assume this is in order to make this smaller for shipping. They utilized that extra space, which is clever and smart. But because there's no instructions, and it doesn't tell you that its hidden in the back of the mirror, it's very easy to think that the part is just missing. I uploaded a video and some photos to show where it is just so you don't fall victim to the confusion like I and many others did as well.\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddfb \ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf9\ud835\ude02\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfbI'm sending this one back. While it won over on aesthetics, the fundamental function of providing a clear, unwarped reflection was a miss. Perhaps I received a lemon, or perhaps it's a consistent issue. Either way, I've linked to a different mirror that\u2019s now my go-to. This one, unfortunately, will remain as a \u2018what could have been\u2019. A 2-star rating seems fair considering the build quality and the lack of quality testing. Despite the promising looks, the TAILI Shower Mirror falls short where it matters the most. The build quality was also flimsy and cheap plastic, but if you're okay with that, go ahead and try it. But I reccomend the JiBen brand one that I linked earlier.",
