Whether it\u2019s pizza night, Taco Tuesday for the kids, enjoying your favorite snack, a family cookout or simple gathering with friends\u2014you\u2019ll want Vanity Fair Extra Absorbent Napkins on your table. The best part? They keep their strength, even when wet, and absorb 40% more than the leading two-ply napkin. Life can get a little messy sometimes. That\u2019s why we designed Vanity Fair Extra Absorbent Napkins\u2014to handle the kinds of messes that require a durable table napkin that\u2019s more absorbent than the leading mid-tier paper towel. Of course, just because our paper napkins are extra absorbent doesn\u2019t mean the texture can\u2019t be soft to boot. After all, when it comes to cleaning your hands and face, we made sure to keep your comfort in mind, too. Durable enough to handle the mess? Check! Soft texture for a comfortable feel when cleaning up? Check! All that\u2019s left is an attractive, embossed design to add an extra touch of style to any messy meal!",
