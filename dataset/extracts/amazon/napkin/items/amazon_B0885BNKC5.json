We already bought the ones we all use for the holidays, but I prefer a simplier design for everyday use. These Extra Absorbent ones are terrific. They are large, they last longer than any everyday paper napkin that we have used. Great for buttery fingers and BBQ's. And they are lovely looking just like the fancy Entertain company ones. We will NEVER switch so we hope you never stop making them.",

The point is to use a clean towel every time I wash my face to prevent breakouts. These do the same thing, less $$, great value. Yes I still breakout \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 because there\u2019s a lot that plays into it not just a clean towel. I like the idea though because a face towel due collect bacteria and dead skin. To make them last I let my face air dry when I\u2019m home. I prefer them over regular paper towels. They are softer.",
