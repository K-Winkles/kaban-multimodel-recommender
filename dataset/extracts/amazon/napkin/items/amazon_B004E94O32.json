For being a disposable, they are pretty, especially in comparison to other brands. These were the most affordable option as well. The 400 count comes in 4 separate packages of 100count each, which I really appreciate. It allows you to open a smaller quantity keeping the remaining fresh for later.We purchased for our toddlers' birthday party and have also used them for 2 more parties since then with enough left over for the next get together.",

They worked and held up fine for my special day. My wedding wasn't formal, but I still wanted a good napkin. I also use them for every day use. That's the great thing about them, they are functional in all situations. They look good enough for a special occasion, but are strong enough for regular days. They last a while because they are fairly thick and strong (especially compared to regular paper towels), so I don't need a ton of them for each meal. Usually one or two napkins will do even for messier foods. They have a nice cloth like texture, so they don't appear cheap if I have company, yet they are fairly economical to use. A package usually lasts me at least month. I am sure there are more sophisticated napkins on the market but for me and my family, we enjoy these napkins and will definitely purchase them again.",

                "reviewText": "Vanity Fair napkins are by far my favorite napkins. They feel soft on your hands and face, yet are very thick and durable, and don't tear or crumble easily. They're larger than most other napkins I've seen, which allows them to last through even the messiest meals, as well as stay on your lap without falling on the floor like the smaller, flimsier napkins. They passed the ultimate test in my house: one napkin was enough to make it through an entire dinner of chicken wings without having to reach for a second napkin. :)These napkins are fairly pricey at my local stores (even Walmart) compared to other brands, so I was thrilled when I found them on Amazon recently on sale as a Prime Pantry item WITH a coupon!! I only bought one pack of the 300-count and am now kicking myself for not stocking up, although 300 napkins will last awhile in my house... I'll definitely be keeping an eye out for another deal on Amazon.",
