                "reviewText": "It\u2019s not picnic season yet but I do imagine they\u2019d be a great addition to any spring or summer event. The quality doesn\u2019t feel cheap, they get the job done, and I was able to test them out on my dining table: works pretty well to wipe them down after some cleaning solution spray. And the design is a good addition/ plus point. Overall, good item.",
