They are grey-looking, rough, thin to the feel and the narrowest, cheapest looking napkins I have ever seen. If the previous reviewers had ever used even the two-ply Smart & Final First Street napkins, they would be sorely disappointed with these Tork so-called napkins. I wish the previous reviewers had been honest with their comments. If I could give these napkins a zero or MINUS five stars, I would. By the way, I am not a complainer and have never reviewed an item before this. Don't waste your money or time anticipating the arrival of a nice product. You will have wasted both!!",
