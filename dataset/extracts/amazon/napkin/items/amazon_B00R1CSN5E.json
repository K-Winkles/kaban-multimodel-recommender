                "reviewText": "In terms of durability, I find that these napkins hold up pretty well. They're not too thin or flimsy, which means they can handle spills and messy hands without falling apart easily. I appreciate that because there's nothing worse than a napkin disintegrating when you need it the most.The size of these napkins is also good. They're neither too small nor too big, making them suitable for most purposes. I find that one napkin is usually enough to get the job done, whether it's wiping your hands or cleaning up a small spill.One minor downside is that they can be a bit linty at times, but it's not a dealbreaker for me. It's something to be aware of if you're using them for more formal occasions.Overall, I'd say the Bounty Paper Napkins are a practical and budget-friendly choice for everyday use. They do the job when you need them, and the pack lasts a while. If you're looking for simple and reliable napkins for your household, these are worth considering.",
