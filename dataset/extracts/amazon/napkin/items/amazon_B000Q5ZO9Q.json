                "reviewText": "You can almost see these, they are so small. Also, they do not hold ANYTHING, especially NOT liquid! They fall apart when you wipe your mouth! And these are a D_ixie brand product! Shame on D_ixie brand!!! They are single ply, as advertised, but maybe 4 1/2\" by 4 1/2\" folded. They are so thin, you can see right through them. NOT good for family use. Maybe a cheap diner product, only. Will not buy again. UGH!",
