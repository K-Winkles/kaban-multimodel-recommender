                "reviewText": "I could use these in my bathroom as individual disposable hand towels, and I may still on special occasions. But the real treat is using them at dinnertime. I rarely buy disposable items because I feel it's just wasteful. These are just so perfect. I love how they feel on my skin as well as how absorbent they are. They are fantastic quality and it's nice to have a little luxury every once in a while. Yes, they are disposable. Yes, they are pricey. But boy do I sure enjoy them. I still use cloth napkins most of the time. But when having anything that might permanently stain my cloth, I pull these out. They're also great for the holidays. I justify getting these because I very rarely purchase disposable paper products so might as well get the good stuff. Highly recommend. This package lasts our family of 6 almost 2 years. Have to make sure I never run out.",
