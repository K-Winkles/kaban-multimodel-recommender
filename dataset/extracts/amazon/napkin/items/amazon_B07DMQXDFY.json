                "reviewText": "I bought both the 100% cotton and the cotton/linen blend napkins. I did not expect first quality napkins at this price, but for the price they actually are very good. They laundered well and were easy to iron (yes, you do need to iron them - they wrinkle badly). After laundering the cotton/linen are very soft and absorbent. The 100% cotton are much thicker and sturdier, will probably hold up better for everyday use. You could probably get away without ironing the 100% cotton napkins.Update: They are holding up well in the wash and are easy to iron with a hot steam iron.",

                "reviewText": "These will shrink around the edge and come out of the laundry wrinkled, a lot. If you do not know how to iron or don't want to, send them to the cleaners for ironing after you wash them. Or, don't buy these, get a polyester that will not be absorbent.If you want a nice napkin after you wash it, do this:Fill a spray bottle with water.Lay out each napkin and spray it with a mist of water, enough to make it damp.Fold or roll it up after spraying and put it in a plastic bag.Do this until you have all the cotton or linen items that you wish to iron.Place the bag, tied shut, in the fridge for up to two days, 24 hours is best.This will disperse the dampness throughout the fabric.When the fabric is damp all the way through, take it out of the fridge and iron it as follows:Fill your iron with water and preheat it to the Cotton or Linen setting.Have your spray bottle of water, sizing or starch handy.First, iron around the edge with the trim facing up, pressing down with the iron, and stretching the edges until they are flat. Flip it over and do the back side too.Second, do the center of the fabric. Flip it and do the front last.If the fabric is too soft and you want it crisp, spray the fabric with sizing or starch as you iron. You want to iron the fabric with lots of steam. Iron it until it feels dry.Once ironed, pile the napkins on a flat surface and let them sit out in the open a few minutes to disperse any remaining moisture.If desired, you can fold them after.If they are too soft, you can use spray fabric sizing or spray starch in place of the water when ironing. Sizing is better as it does not create flakes like starch can do. This will help when you are folding a napkin to stand up.You can iron any piece of clothing this way that is made of Cotton, Wool, or Linen. It takes practice and square flat items are good for that. Don't add starch to wool, sizing is better.These are the real deal, so they take some care and look beautiful for many years. They actually look and the touch/feel is better after washing and ironing. I despise synthetics for any use in the kitchen and dining room. They are useless when it comes to absorbency and heat resistance.",
