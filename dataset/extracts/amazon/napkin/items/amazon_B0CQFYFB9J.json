Since they are rarely wider than 2.5 inches then one can use them to store smaller items which would otherwise clutter up a desk. One of mine holds small writing note pads, another booklets I may need off-and-on such as those for cable or AC and Kindle usage instructions, etc. This particular one will be used to hold a three year calendar and a book with all my web page information.It is sturdy and stands well on its own even when I pull an item out. Since the sides are multi-layered, different sizes can be used. Even though I am not using it for napkins, this attractive holder would look good sitting on a kitchen counter or on a dining room table. It would look equally good holding every day napkins or those designed for entertainment. The black color would not clash with whatever color napkins being used. FInally, this item is a steal at $5.99 at the time of this review. A five star item.",

                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t know why it has been so hard for me to find the perfect napkin holder, but here it is! It is the perfect size and looks good with smaller and larger napkins. It is not too wide, so you don\u2019t have to completely stuff it with 100 napkins, which I really appreciate. Sometimes with other napkin holders, if you don\u2019t have enough napkins, they will flop over and look weird, but not in this one. It is made of black metal and has four little round balls on the bottom, which I'm sure will help prevent your counter from scratching. It says it\u2019s for indoor and outdoor use but I only use it indoor. What a great price for this. Highly recommend!",
