It prevents people from \"thoughtlessly\" grabbing a handful of napkins at once and throwing away more than necessary.",

I bought her the Torx napkin dispenser and this box of 6000 napkins and now it only needs refilling once every month or so. This box lasted our family of 4 more than 3 and 1/2 years!!! Not to mention, my wife didn't have to get up every other meal to get more napkins. And she doesn't have to buy napkins when she gets groceries. She loves it. I liked doing something small to make her life easier. And the napkins work just fine at getting stuff off your face or hands.",

I use it because I like the Tork dispensers, I don't know if I love the price, but even though they cost more, the customers take fewer and waste them rather than if you just had ones that were easy to grab a stack of. So you'll probably come out the same in napkin expenses.",
