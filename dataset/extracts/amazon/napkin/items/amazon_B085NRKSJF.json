The ones that are advertised as \"linen feel\" are terrible. Not absorbent and definitely don't feel like linen. So I always eliminate the \"linen feel\" ones. Others that are absorbent are often too thin. As soon as you start drying your hands, they start to fall apart. I found these towels to be *close* to being too flimsy ... but not quite. As you start to dry your hands, they seem like they might be too flimsy, but they ACTUALLY DO HOLD UP. Great balance of absorbency and sturdiness. Recommended!",
