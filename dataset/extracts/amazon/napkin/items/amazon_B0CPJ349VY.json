I would never have bought these they are so sheer and cheap somewhere between gauze and nylons. They are already all pulled , and look horrible I wouldn\u2019t use them as a napkin for anyone. I\u2019m moving so I put them in a box but I\u2019ll just end up throwing them out. They are not even suitable for a cleaning rag. I\u2019m just being honest and don\u2019t want to see people wasting their hard earned money on something that goes in the garbage. Now I\u2019ll need to purchase new ones which is rather maddening. I would never recommend these Boho Chic Napkins to anyone , they are useless for anything!",
