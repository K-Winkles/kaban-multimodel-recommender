So I took a chance, having never used them going strictly on customer reviews.First, they are a bit SMALLER In overall Size. My usual brand is 6\u201d square. Kirkland brand measures 5 5/8\u201d.I like the FEEL of my brand over the Kirkland....... my brand has a softer, puffy and more Textured. Kirkland feels slightly stiffer, flatter and smoother. The Absorption, to my surprise, was BETTER in the Kirkland....it clearly beat \u201cthe quicker picker upper\u201d. I was also surprised at the thickness difference. See photos. When full opened and laid side by side, you can kinda see through \u201cmy usual brand\u201d where as with the Kirkland, you can\u2019t see through it. Side by side, You can see how much larger my brand is over Kirkland. Long story short....I\u2019m not Thrilled with Kirkland and doubt I\u2019ll buy them again, but they are decent when it comes to absorbing and thickness. Comparing to other brands, it\u2019s a very good choice.",
