Each of the 12 could use some touched up stitching where it appears frayed. And I may do that some day if I find time. Also, they are cotton and linen, so yes, they need to be ironed. Having said that, my friend spilled red wine during Thanksgiving dinner and another friend used her napkin to clean up! I sprayed it and my new tablecloth with Shout, soaked the tablecloth and the used napkins in some non chlorine bleach solution, and washed all in hot water. Everything came out perfect! So I was pretty pleased!",
