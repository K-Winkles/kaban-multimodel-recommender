                "reviewText": "These napkins are excellent in every aspect. First, the napkins themselves are very nice and thick, definitely not your average grocery store variety. They also have a classy look to them, making them perfect for birthday parties, romantic candlelight dinners, or formal occasions. They are also a great value considering that you get 200 pieces for only ten dollars, which is the same price point as normal napkins. Honestly, I may just start buying these from now on as my regular napkins. They are very durable, too, so if you spill a bit of liquid, one napkin can be used instead of three or four because you can flip it over and also use the inside of it. It may actually be more efficient to use these instead. I highly recommend these, 5/5!",

I love how they look when fanned out on the table or in a napkin holder. I should add that these napkins are not flimsy, but rather are on the thicker side. I think that makes them even more useful, since they are almost coaster -like ( without being too stiff). I highly recommend these for any occasion!",

I think the color is closer to what you see in the picture provided by the seller than my picture (I took it at night with the light on). Overall pretty good product at a decent price. I will repurchase if we need more.",
