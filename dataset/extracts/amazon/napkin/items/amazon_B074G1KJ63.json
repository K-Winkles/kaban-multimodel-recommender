More trees means better air, water, habitat and chance to combat climate change. We believe most people want to do better by the Earth. But where to start? We started Caboo: two brothers, a wife and a friend. Wiping out forests along with a spill or a bum just didn't make sense to us. So we figured it out, building relationships with trusted farmers, retailers and folks along the way. Ten years and two kids later, we're even more committed to making tree-free the go-to. Daily decisions like choosing Caboo do make a difference. We and the forest thank you!",

The size is excellent. They are thin and suitable for packing in lunch boxes, etc. I am thrilled that they are a more environmentally friendly option. They were nicely packaged, and the plastic they are packaged in is also recycled. They were delivered quickly. They wouldn't be highly absorbent - they are not thick like paper towels. They are actually a bit softer than I expected, and I am happy with the quality and will order them again in the future.",

The napkins are sturdy and do not tear easily, even with heavier use. If you\u2019re looking for plastic free, these are unfortunately wrapped in plastic.One downside I noticed is that the napkins have a slight texture to them, which may not be suitable for all occasions. Additionally, they may not be the most cost-effective option for frequent use, but the eco-friendly benefits may outweigh the cost.Overall, I would recommend these eco-friendly bamboo paper napkins to anyone looking for a sustainable and sturdy option for their kitchen. They are a great alternative to traditional paper napkins and a step towards a more sustainable lifestyle.",

I think that the number of napkins for the money is a good value; but I also think that they\u2019re too thin. We\u2019ll use them of course, and they\u2019re okay for informal dinners though it may take more than one sometimes to get through the meal, so when it\u2019s time to reorder, I\u2019ll continue my search for a thicker, single ply, ecologically responsible napkin.",
