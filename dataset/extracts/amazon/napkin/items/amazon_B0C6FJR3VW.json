                "reviewText": "These are great for every day, run of the mill, family dinner usage - They absorb reasonably well, they're reasonably good at holding up to stains and wrinkles after a couple of washes, and the patterns are distracting enough if there is a small stain. I wouldn't call them elegant or classy, and wouldn't think to use them for say, a fancy dinner party or a holiday, but they're great for the everyday to replace paper napkins!",
