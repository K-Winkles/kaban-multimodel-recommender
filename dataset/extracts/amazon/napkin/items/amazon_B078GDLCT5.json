I have a mustache and napkins are important if I don't want to look like a slob while eating messy things.These areade from heavier paper and are larger than standard paper napkins. Yes, they cost more, but it is rare that you need a second napkin like the cheap ones, so the cost evens out. I highly recommend these napkins.",
