                "reviewText": "This pack of 500 napkins is conveniently organized into 10 bags, with each bag containing 50 pieces. Each napkin boasts a robust 3-ply construction, providing a commendable thickness that makes it suitable not only for dining rooms but also for office settings. Furthermore, these napkins can be unfolded to cover a larger area when needed.Considering the price point, it undeniably offers excellent value for obtaining 500 packs. The napkins exhibit good liquid absorbency, effectively handling spills. However, it's important to note that these napkins are primarily designed for cocktail use, which may affect their softness. Consequently, you may find them slightly less comfortable for use as mouth wipes.",

                "reviewText": "Reviewing: \"Vplus 500 Pack Cocktail Napkins Paper, 3-Ply Beverage Napkins, Disposable White Square Napkins, Perfect for Restaurant, Event, Bar, Wedding, Baby Shower and Daily Use\"These napkins are excellent. And they are legit 3-ply that is folded 4 ways. The individual plies are hard to see unless you look really closely because they are all embossed together, but they are definitely there. I was able to separate them with a fine blade and was able to get a pic, which I'll post.I am using these primarily for food instead of beverages because I like to keep a regular napkin in my lap and a smaller napkin on the table to wipe my fingers. These are absorbent and strong, and they don't rip when you're using them. They are also fairly soft, not crinkly like some of the other napkins I've tried in the past. Another feature I like is that they come in an actual cardboard, so they are easy to store in the pantry if you want to. You get 10 packs of 50, each one wrapped individually, so they stay fresh until you're ready to use them.At the current price of around 20 for a box of 500 napkins, it works out to less than half a cent per napkin, so they are a good value, especially considering the quality. I've spent more on lesser quality because I couldn't find anything else. Now that I know these are here, I will definitely reorder.I rate every Vine item based on how I would have felt if it were a regular purchase, ie: whether I would have sent the item back for a refund, or whether I would have felt satisfied that I got my money's worth. In the case of these napkins, I absolutely would have been happy, and I would have left the same 5-star review I'm leaving today.",

                "reviewText": "I've gotten \"value packs\" on Amazon before and often they end up being an inferior quality to what I was expecting (because I've had better elsewhere). That's not to say they were bad, just not as great as I'd hoped. But these cocktail napkins are soft, thick and absorbent without dissolving like some bar napkins do. I use them with guests when we have drinks all the time, and now I don't have to worry about coasters as much. These aren't actually substitutes for coasters, but they do allow you to put a drink down for a minute or two and then pick it up again, because the napkin is absorbent enough to handle that. Overall they are a very nice quality and I'm really happy I got this value pack of 500 so I will always have some of these around when company comes!",
