I actually use them to wash off my dishes after dinner.Recommended.",

The Brawny paper towels are very absorbent, yet soft and having the option of squares is absolutely perfect. It allows you to not be wasteful and choose how much product you need. I also use these paper towels for crafts\ud83d\ude03",
