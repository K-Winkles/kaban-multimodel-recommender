As far as weight, they are very light like inexpensive appetizer or dessert napkins. I first wrote a really nasty review and then changed it because the information is all there if you want to use it. Drawing out how big these are would have told most people how small they are. For the price these are only home quality - you wouldn't expect this weight at dinner party or wedding - and they say that. Then I laughed at myself for being so critical since for the las 6 months we've been using paper towels as our napkins! When my dear son-in-law and his family are helping me get dinner ready, he will yell out to his wife (and my daughter) \"Hey Liz, no dinner napkins just like last time.\" Can't wait to see what he says his Sunday. Six out of 7 days of the week I eat alone so these will work for me fine - I will buy a heavier grade and larger napkin next time because I prefer that too (except wth hand held portions of BBQ like a rib.",
