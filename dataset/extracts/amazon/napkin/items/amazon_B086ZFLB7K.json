If I'd opened the package when they arrived vs. my husband, i would have sent them back immediately. After seeing them this morning and using one, i'm sending these back. Not cool, but we did get a good laugh out of it though. You can see the size in relation to a typical kleenex box in my photos. I'll be returning these to get 250 nice vanity fair napkins from Target for less money than these 100 lame napkins cost.",
