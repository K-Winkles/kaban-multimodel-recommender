                "reviewText": "Took me several tries, ordering different types of cloth napkins to find the \"perfect\" ones, and these are it. 100% cotton, and really, really soft. But still sturdy and thick enough that they work for anything from \"normal napkin stuff\" to quickly soaking up a spill and even for blowing your nose. They wash up great, and even with the deep orange color I got ... the color didn't run, and there was no excessive amount of lint like one sometimes gets with the first wash/dry of cotton items.Not that wrinkling in napkins really bothers me, but I was surprised at how little there was coming out of the dryer.One reviewer mentioned each napkin having a rigid label, but the company must have changed that, since the labels in the set I got are the normal kind one finds in any sort of garments and such. Soft, small, and not at all noticeable when using the napkins.",

Amazon has been very patient with me buying then returning at least 4 times, what turn out to be shiny restaurant show napkins with no absorbency at all. These napkins from Native Fab are terrific! Quite large, absorbent, and very soft & usable right out of the dryer for every day, maybe will iron them for my fancier dinner parties. Beautiful detailing especially around edges, and nice dark color. Delivery was very fast, and packaging kept them in perfect condition.",

                "reviewText": "Pros: Nice, thick, soft material; laundered well and didn't require ironing - a big plus in my book!; a good, medium red color; detailing on edge dresses them up a bit.Cons: After laundering, they are not perfectly square; the big, white labels are a bit of a pain to remove.Bottom line: Given the shape and material, I doubt they would ever look crisp, even with ironing, much less hold a fancy swan shape. But that works for me, and I'm happy enough with them that I'll probably order another set in a different color.",

                "reviewText": "Arrived quickly which was great because I needed them for a weekend dinner party! Washed them beforehand to remove any chemical residue or odor. There was a slight chemical odor when I got it but it was very faint. The black color is intensely dark. After washing it, it did not fade. I also got black to camouflage any stains that may remain after washing. Seems well constructed as it held up to machine washing. I hung it up to dry. Did not use the dryer thinking it may fade the color or shrink. It is not wrinkle-free. I had to steam iron them individually. Looked great with the napkin rings which I also purchased through Amazon. Happy with my purchase and would recommend these napkins to family and friends, and would purchase again in another color for variety.",
