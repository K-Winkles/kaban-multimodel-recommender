So do not purchase. They will be hearing from me. Update. Just saw they updated their photos on this product claiming they are the same amount. I just counted another one and it is 25 short per package. So they are lying. Attorney Generals office will be notified.I have been buying these for 10 yrs. They used to be thicker and more absorbing and easy to pull just one out. Now you pull them and they are all stuck together. It\u2019s like every 3rd one that comes out has another 3 stuck to it. So you pull out so many when you only want one. And the packing around them (brown paper) used to be so tight it was almost spring loaded when you opened it. Now they are all mushy and falling out without even opening it. They feel more like Kleenex and fall apart when wet. They are awful. And I purchase the same ones. I just reorder the same thing every month. So they changed and made them cheap and worthless. Do better and try a different brand. Not amazon brand though. That brand makes little fine white dust particles everywhere. Makes a big mess.",
