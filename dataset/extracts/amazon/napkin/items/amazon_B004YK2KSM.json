                "reviewText": "I tried another \"name\" brand (hint: it's an actual first name) and found them to be thin, and would often tear apart when pulling them out of the dispenser. I gave Pacific Blue a chance last year and was happy. These are thicker and stronger, don't rip as easy when pulling from the dispenser (there is always some ripping if your hands are wet, but these are better), and I'm happy with the price per quantity. I mainly use these in the garage to dry my hands after washing, but I sometimes use them to clean up spills and they work good. I won't go back to the \"name\" brand; these are better quality for me.",
