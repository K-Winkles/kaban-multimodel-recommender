                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Apologies for the less than perfect video quality! These napkins came wrapped in plastic neatly folded and without any wrinkles or bends. The napkin is folded to the size of a traditional dinner napkin, making this useful for both the bathroom as a hand towel or on the dining room table as a guest napkin. When opened fully the napkin is a great size to dry your hands if being used in the bathroom or a very generous napkin during meals. The colors are slightly muted but run towards the more vibrant side of muted than not, the overwhelming theme is pink the bunny is cute it definitely resonates with Easter and springtime. Hope these notes and the modest video are helpful for you!",
