                "reviewText": "The napkins are OK. A little thin, but they work as lunch napkins.The product photo is misleading, though. It shows 2 packs of 500 but they ship 1 pack of 1000.I picked this product specifically because I was stocking two different break rooms and was planning to put 1 package in each.(Not a huge deal, I just need to figure out how to contain the napkins not actively in dispensers since I can't just leave them in the original packaging as I'd planned to. Because they are so light, they tend to blow around anytime a cabinet door is opened instead of just staying neatly in a stack like other napkins might.)",
