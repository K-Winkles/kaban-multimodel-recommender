                "reviewText": "You will not be disappointed in these beautiful jeans!! I\u2019m usually a 31 waist but these fit best in 30 waist with plenty of stretch! The elasticity of these jeans sets them apart from any other jeans I own, because they are still quite formfitting, while also VERY comfortable! They are at the limit of what I would pay for a pair of jeans, but WELL worth the price if jeans are your jam!! Silver does not disappoint, & my booty curves love \u2018em too! What more can you assk for??\ud83d\udc8b",

These are the first ones that fit me perfectly. I can't express just how high the quality of these jeans are. I wish I could get their sizing chart right. I don't have a 34\" inseam just bc I have a big waist and that's kinda how theirs works. I love the fit of these jeans. Strong and sturdy jean fabric. Thicker than most.",

The one thing is they are low rise, and for my comfort I'd have to wear a longer shirt with these on. But if you don't mind low rise then these are perfect for you. I love the material, and overall look of them. They hug my curves well and are comfortable to be in all day. The length is perfect for wearing my combat boots with.",

I have a few other pairs of Silver jeans, and I love wearing them all. Order true to size, I believe these say to order a size down as they are a bit stretchy. I ordered true to size and was delighted. Finally low rise jeans are on the market again! I am planning to get another pair of these I love them that much. Fabulous jeans.",
