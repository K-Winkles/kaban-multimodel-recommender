                "reviewText": "Literally the BEST jeans I have put on in years. I worry that Lee will discontinue or change this product. Lee Jeans, if by some whim of fate you are actually reading this please don't change this product! I am a cheapskate and I would pay double for these jeans if I had to. Shopko carries a lower quality version for Lee simply called \"smoothers\". Those are okay, but this \"Indigo\" line is much nicer.Before I got these jeans, I would not have thought I would ever wear a pull-on jean.OK, the review - Yes, these are pull-on jeans. No, they do not look like \"mom jeans\". No button to catch your tops or make your tummy look poochier than it is. These pants are perfection. No, I am not a paid reviewer and I did not receive a discount.Fit: For reference, I am in my late 40's, 5'7\", in the neighborhood of 143 lbs. I tend toward a smallish waist as compared to my bottom and thighs, but getting a bit fluffy around the middle with a little bit of a pooch. I bought a size 10A. These fit like a dream! They sit just below the natural waist. Therefore, smoothing away my pooch without causing muffin top. They fit smoothly over hips, bottom and thighs without the baggy gap that makes jeans look like mom jeans. But, no creeping up the crack or other unsightly close fit issues. Being someone who is tall-ish, but not tall I often have difficulty with pant length. Very often for me, Average is too short and Tall is way too long. These are perfect length. When I stand barefoot, they cover my entire heel just touching the floor. Also, these do not creep up or down. I'm not constantly pulling them up, nor tugging them down. That is practically unheard of for me.Quality: Denim weight is just right, not too light or too heavy and stiff, fabric is soft. Overall construction is sound, pockets and seams lay nicely.",

                "reviewText": "These are my favorite fitting jeans. i've bought 3 pairs so far (went up in sizes) and each one fit exactly as expected. They're super comfortable for jeans, with good stretch. If you're like me and you pull your jeans up by the belt loops, the loops are very sturdy and hold up to lots of pulls. The pockets are a little bigger than most women's jeans pockets so they're actually useful!The one thing that knocks off a star for me is that the Polar Drift dye smells awful and takes several soaks in hot water and vinegar to get the smell and excess dye out. The vinegar and hot water combo is key -- it sets the dye and gets rid of the smell. Let it soak, rinse and repeat a couple times until the water runs clear, then you can wash with detergent like normal. This is normal for a lot of dark wash jeans, but it's still a hassle.",

                "reviewText": "These are not the Lees of the past! The only thing that would make these jeans better, is if they came with a high waist. I have been scanning Amazon this morning and found other pair that have a high waist. Going to try them. They are not so loose around the waist that they fall down. But also, they are not digging into my waist. I am 5\u20184\u201c tall and weigh 135 pounds. The size 8 fits me perfectly. Also, I love that the pockets sit low on your butt. I just think it makes your butt look better. Smaller.",

They\u2019re just blue and have a faded look on the thighs.If I wanted low rise, regular blue jeans, I\u2019d give these 5 stars.I am keeping them because the legs are perfect at the bottom. Not flared or boot cut or skinny. Just straight.I will wear jackets or long sweaters with these.I would like these in a higher rise, closer to my belly button (these are a good 2 inches lower than my belly button- very early 2000s).",

But since I\u2019ve gained so much weight with this Covid thing and I have absolutely have nothing to wear I decided to try them on. I was surprised! These jeans are super comfy and look really good! The length is perfect for petite. I love these! I\u2019ve recommended them to my sister!I\u2019m glad I made a mistake in when I bought them.",
