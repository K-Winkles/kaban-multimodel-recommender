                "reviewText": "however..., I only gave them 4 stars because it states mid-rise on the product information and they shipped me high-rise. I don't know if that's Amazon or the seller, but I wanted the medium rise.Nonetheless, I am keeping them for 2 reasons. The first being that they are great fitting and feeling. I wanted flare jeans more importantly than mid-rise so I am willing to settle on receiving high rise. They still fit well. I am 5'8\" and about 175 pounds. I normally wear a Levi's 28 medium/regular/standard and tried these Levi's Signature size 6 which was supposed to be the same and they were spot on. Just wish they were mid-rise.The second reason I am keeping them is honestly because since they fit, I am lazy and don't want to go through the hassle of shipping them back to get another pair. They look good and feel good regardless, so I will just admit I'm lazy.I also got the darker ones and they messed up again and sent True Boot and they were mid-rise and thankfully their idea of bootcut fits like flare jeans anyway. These were mid-rise at least and marked flare and are, so I'm happy. Comfy good jeans just seems like a dice roll to get what you ordered, at least it was on 2 counts for me.4 stars for sizing errors, but good fitting and comfortable jeans and quality.",

                "reviewText": "I decided that I hate skinny jeans (especially the high rise ones). Boot cut is like the granny panties of jeans and soooo much more comfortable! These are soft, comfortable, no weird dye smells (looking at you black jeans), some stretch but not too much so you get baggy bum.My body type is maybe athletic? But I have a short torso and not much of a waistline\u2026. I have hips, but not really a butt\u2026 my inseam is usually about 33\u201d but can get away with shorter for skinny jeans. But I can wear these with flats and be fine (not short & not dragging). Im about 5\u20193, approximately 170 or so (but fairly muscular). I have the 12\u2019s in the pull on skinny Jean (both long & regular for ankle jeans) from Levi\u2019s and ordered the 12\u2019s in these. I might have been able to size down to a 10 but I really didn\u2019t want tight jeans or muffin top! So if you have slimmer legs or waist, I\u2019d recommend sizing down one size! I don\u2019t want to chance losing length by shrinking in the dryer, but they are most definitely a comfortable fit & wear as is \ud83d\ude0a",
