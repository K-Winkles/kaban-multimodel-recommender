                "reviewText": "I have purchased plenty of jeans in my 56 years, at a variety of prices. We all complain how difficult it is to find jeans that fit. Levi\u2019s were my go-to for the longest time, but they started to disappoint and the styles just stopped working for me. I tried Wrangler and Democracy and Rock and Roll Cowgirl \u2014, all kinds and all prices. NYDJ (16w) are in my closet, but honestly, these are my general go-to right now. I have them in cream stone for my \u201cKhakis\u201d and greenwich/darker when I am kicking around. They are comfortable, but do not overly stretch out throughout the day. They fit my waist without any major gap (I wear a belt) and look darn good, especially considering the price. I now have 5 pair in different shades. I\u2019m not sure why bootcut isn\u2019t offered, but I can make these work with boots or just switch to NYDJ. The one big thing for me\u2026.I am SO tired of everything suction cupped to me. Fitted is different than painted on\u2026where did all the real jeans go? Straight leg and bootcut without artificial holes all over place, and maybe some cotton in there? While I do keep looking, I\u2019d say give these a go if you are looking for a decent every day straight leg.",

Even though they are petite, still 2 inches too long (I'm 4 ft 10) but not so long as to be a problem. The material is nice, the color is good. The button hole seems less finished then it should be with frayed strings and almost too small to pass the button through right away. I am sure this will change over time with wear. Happy with these pants.",
