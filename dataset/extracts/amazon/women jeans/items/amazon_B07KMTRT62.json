                "reviewText": "I loved these Levi's and actually fit better than the others. But I had the same problem with them that I had w/the others. Even when the jeans I was purchasing stated length 28\" or stating short, they were 30\" and another pair, not levi's were like 32\"! Everything I tried or thought I was trying to buy that showed, insinuated or stated w/pics that all 501's I wanted were 28 or 27x28 which I think would have been a good if not great fit. So on to the cords I tried here, I was psyched cuz they were pretty burgundy color but says dark chocolate or put it this way, dark brown it's not, it's burgundy. Someone is colorblind that names the colors! This style, 724's are really so comfortable, so soft, so pretty, cute cords! And almost fit!!!!! I could have gotten by with the cut of waist and even being a little bigger through hips, but (not bad) what made it look big was the length that pushed the fabric up to hips, but, waist!!!! I mean I am so over trying so many sizes, styles of Levi's on and biggest problem lately has been the cut through the abdomen, hip & but area vs the waist. Some of these styles, as this 724 I think would have looked quite nice except for the length bunching fabric up. Got too much to do than hem pants. I'll wear my Ralph Lauren Cords for Christmas in Denver w/Family or freeze! Real shame though, hope Levi's starts listening or retailers order for their customers, all of them not just all one size and hope majority wears the weird size to the rest of too tall, too short women. Really! Never had problems with Levi's entire life, not just old 501's, all of them that were to my liking and right size were actually cut and sewn to fit most all of us regular girls, women, females, the same we were few years ago, same figure, same size, etc. So if I'm the same, it must be the \"other\" that are different, they gained weight for all of us????? Listen if you are taller than my 5'3\", 125lbs, petitie 34DD, small back, long waist, short to med legs. See? Regular! So what I began, if you need length, these will be gorgeous for the holidays and warm all the remaining time! Go for it, good price too! They actually remind me of my Ralph Lauren's but softer! Hard to do. The fit though!!!!! Boo Hoo!",

Both have a thinner and stretchier material than the Levi Ribcage or Wedgie styles.Chelsea Pier- Dark Indigo in 28 short:I think they feel more comfortable than Wedgie and Ribcage, but they also remind me of jeans that you would probably get at WalMart or Target. As with all Levi's, I still experinced gaping at the waist in the back but the front digs into my tummy and ribs when I sit down. The length is perfect.Black Sesame in 27 Short:They were too tight everywhere. I definitely had to squeeze them over the bubble butt. Slighty too small in the waist and an uncomfortable hug everywhere else. The length was perfect though. I might exchange for a larger size.",

                "reviewText": "I love that Levi's 724 High Rise jeans are actually designed for women with curves! I'm really short (4' 11\") so the short inseam is about an inch too long--that's typical for me. At 115 pounds, the 28 fits well in the waist and hips. I usually wear a 4 or 6 petite (US sizing). The fabric is softer than other brands--not stiff at all. They're super comfortable and flattering! I went with Way Way Back, which is a medium blue with no top stitching, no distressing, and no frayed edges.",

I am 5'5\" and 170, ordered a 32R. Otherwise I love them, they are very comfortable, just enough stretch, and a lighter weight denim which I prefer. They are as pictured in the photos. I'll wash them a few times to see if they shrink, otherwise I'll have to have them shortened. I will update this review with the outcome.",
