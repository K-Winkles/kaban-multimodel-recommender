The material doesn't have much give so it really sucks everything in and gives you a nice slimming trim look! BUT because they didn't have much stretch they decided to rip out right by the back pocket (my big booty may have also contributed to that). So not the most durable material of jeans. This style was called Sara, but I did find a different color called Shelby that has a bit more of a stretchy material and sized up for a more forgiving fit and I'm very happy with them so far! Order a bigger size in these if you need a bit more room.",

They\u2019re a bit tight but do have enough stretch to stretch out some in the waist and hips. They fit perfectly in the legs and having long legs the 27/36 worked out great. I\u2019m 5\u20198\u201d and weigh 144. I could size up but I doubt they would look as good as this pair does and I think a couple wears will stretch them out. Not worried. I also tried the Shelby in the same size. The Shelby has more stretch is a bit shorter and larger in the 36 and just didn\u2019t look as good on so returning. Anyway, look great and I love these. They are somewhat distressed and the wash is great. Love the flare retro look. Flares aren\u2019t too big, just right.",
