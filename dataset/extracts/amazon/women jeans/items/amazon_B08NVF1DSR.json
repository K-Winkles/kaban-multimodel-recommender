                "reviewText": "I take reviews very serious because they truly have helped me. For reference I am 32 curvy and have hips and thighs. I am struggling with the trend of \"baggy\" or \"mom Jeans\" as they in my opinion are not the most flattering on my body type. I also have been wearing skinny jeans since like high school. i have been attempting to make this transition (since my teenagers is harassing me about being off trend and Skinny's are not cool) Blah blah and i love Levi's so this was a safe starting point. The Jeans have a button fly which lays so flattering on the midsection, the butt is still snug and fits like the skinny jeans and the thigh's are pretty tight depending on the size you decide to go with. i read to order up a size, i did and after a few wears i wished i had stuck to my real size they became really loose in the thigs and more baggy then i would like. SO i ordered a second pair in my size they were snug but Definity wore out to be true to size and i love them, I'm still not 100% sold on the trend but i can wear these and style then cute and make it work. To wrap this lengthy review up, give them a try in a few colors bc deferent colors fit a bit deferent and amazon has free return and i used \"try before you buy\" on more than one to see how i liked them. You have nothing to lose..except your skinny jeans LOL Good luck and i hope this ramble helped. XO",

                "reviewText": "These are truly the most comfortable and flattering jeans. I love the button fly, the way the pockets lay, and the wash color. These are definitely a really on trend jean! My only complaint is that they are a bit too long for me so I wish they offered a petite or short option. If you have a short torso the high waisted fit may bother you sitting down. I am used to that feeling and like high waisted pants so I am okay with that. I am 4'11\" and 145lbs and I ordered a size 30. They are loose and comfortable but hug my curves well just the way I like my jeans to fit. I would say pretty true to size! Definitely a 9/10!!",

I loved them so much I purchased a black pair. I had to return them 2x and size up to a 28! Same exact jeans! I also laid them out on trip of one another and there\u2019s no difference in the cut or size, except one is a 28 and one is a 26. Regardless they are great jeans and make your butt look good. Just know that the black ones with the hole in the knee run two sizes small.",

My normal jean size in other brands is 27 (I'm 5'9\" and 130lb). Nice and high, a little stretch, great quality. $50!",
