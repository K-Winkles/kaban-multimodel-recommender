                "reviewText": "Like so many other women here I was thrilled to finally get 100% cotton jeans. I ended up here after ordering jeans from two other big name companies who both sent me cotton-poly-spandex blends, and back they both went! Here I ordered black jeans in tall. For myself, I found that my usual size was a tad too small, so I exchanged them for the next size up. (Some people here said the jeans ran a bit small.) The only problem was that the waist was a bit too big and the pants felt like they would slide down. However, I sew so I put four very small darts in the waistband, and now they are perfect. Some others said they had trouble with the waistband, some too big, some too small. The inseam is 33 inches (someone got a 30 inch inseam when they ordered tall) and for me the length is just right. A couple of people said the jeans had a chemical smell, but that seemed to be the blue jeans, rather than the black, which is what I ordered. The color is also a nice deep black, not wishy washy. I certainly believe these other women's experiences, I guess the bottom like is that people come is so many shapes and sizes and sometimes it's not easy finding clothes that fit you.",

I need jeans that give me freedom of movement and protect my skin when I garden and work with my family on construction projects. I don't care about looking fashionable when I work other than I don't want my butt crack to show. I ordered another pair of these jeans and found the fit has been changed. The center back seam is a full inch shorter than the previous 2 pairs of jeans. This means that every time I would bend over, the jeans would slip down my lower back. Sadly, I sent the new pair back.",

                "reviewText": "These are the most comfortable jeans I have ever had. I hate shopping for clothes online but due to lockdown I ordered a pair as my old jeans were worn out. They were so comfortable that after I had washed them a few times I decided to order a second pair. They wash really well without fading or shrinking and they became even more comfortable (if that is possible) after washing.",
