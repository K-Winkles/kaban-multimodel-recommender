                "reviewText": "I bought a set of the (New) Flash Black some months ago, and I love them because they are 99% cotton/1% elastane. It means that they feel like true, rugged jeans that conform to you and won't easily loose their shape. However, I tried buying a pair of the Say No Go's and a second set of the (New) Flash Black and both were made of a cotton/poly blend. I find that cotton/poly's become loose and the waistband gets floppy after a few months of wear and washing, which is *not* what I'm looking for in a pair of $60-$70 jeans. The materials and quality are just vastly different, which is super disappointing given the cost.I will offer that when buying the Say No Go's, I did not check their materials list. So that's on me and I accept that I flubbed. However, there's been no materials list change in the (New) Flash Black jeans. They should still be made with the cotton/elastane blend, rather than the stretchy poly material. I'm going to give it another order and try again for the correct materials, but if that doesn't pan out I'll have to seek them out in stores.ETA: Bought a set of the Black Deconstructed, which listed as being 85.5% cotton, 13.5% polyester, 1% elastane(hadn't checked the material list before ordering, but prayed when it was en route). The pants that came have a tag stating 100% cotton and feel accurate to that. I'd caution those buying to just be aware that you may or may not receive the advertised material.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Levi's Women's High Waisted Mom Jeans, and overall, I found them to be a decent choice for those seeking a classic, vintage-inspired look. While they may not be perfect for everyone, they have their merits and offer a unique style that many fashion enthusiasts appreciate.One of the notable features of these jeans is their high-waisted design, which is reminiscent of the popular \"mom jeans\" style. The high rise provides a flattering fit and offers good coverage, making them suitable for various body types. The jeans sit comfortably at the waist and offer a relaxed, slightly loose fit throughout the legs.Levi's is a well-known brand that has a reputation for producing quality denim products, and these jeans are no exception. The fabric is durable and feels sturdy, ensuring that they can withstand regular wear. The attention to detail in the stitching and overall construction is evident, showcasing the brand's commitment to craftsmanship.The wash options available for these jeans are varied, allowing you to choose between lighter or darker shades depending on your preference. The vintage-inspired washes add to the overall appeal, giving the jeans a worn-in, lived-in look. However, it's worth noting that the color intensity and fade may vary between different pairs, so it's advisable to inspect them carefully before making a purchase.One aspect to consider with these jeans is their fit. As with any style, the fit can vary from person to person, and it may take some trial and error to find the perfect size and cut for your body shape. Some individuals may find that the waistband runs slightly larger or smaller than expected, so it's important to refer to the size chart and customer reviews for guidance.Additionally, while the loose, relaxed fit is a defining characteristic of mom jeans, it may not suit everyone's preferences or body shape. The silhouette can appear less form-fitting compared to other styles, which may not be flattering for those seeking a more tailored look. It's essential to consider your personal style and comfort when deciding if these jeans are the right choice for you.In terms of versatility, the Levi's Women's High Waisted Mom Jeans offer the opportunity to create various outfits. They pair well with casual tops, oversized sweaters, or even crop tops for a trendy ensemble. The vintage-inspired look lends itself well to a laid-back, retro aesthetic, allowing you to experiment with different styles and accessories to make them your own.In conclusion, the Levi's Women's High Waisted Mom Jeans offer a decent option for those seeking a classic, vintage-inspired look. With their high-rise design, quality denim, and versatile wash options, they can be a reliable addition to your wardrobe. However, it's important to consider the fit and personal style preferences to ensure that these jeans align with your individual needs. Overall, if you appreciate the mom jeans style and are willing to experiment with different outfits, these Levi's jeans can be a satisfactory choice.",

When ordering there was two different size options, there was 29 regular and a 29- I ordered the one that just said 29 so I'm guessing if I chose the 29 regular they would be longer in length. For sizing reference I'm 5'4 and 146 lbs",

Tampoco s\u00e9 si recomiendo la tabla de tallas porque de acuerdo con ella deb\u00eda pedir el 27 Para que me quedar\u00e1 de cintura (y ahora me doy cuenta que me iba a quedar mucho m\u00e1s grande). En cuanto al dise\u00f1o: la tela se ve de buena calidad y el modelo es hermoso, hace bonita figura aunque seas desn*lgada como yop y mis jeans si traen la banderita en la bolsa que dice Levi\u2019s (cosa que vi que no a todas les llega igual).",
