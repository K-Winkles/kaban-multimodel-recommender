The length is perfect but the waist on this style is a little loose so I might have to wear a belt or get it taken in. They are overall pretty comfortable but the bum area is a little tight. I\u2019ve washed them and they wash well but get wrinkled so I just have to iron them after each wash. Would recommend.",

I have a curvy figure and thick legs all the way threw.I sized choosing my hip measurements and the waist measurement was an \"inch or so\" bigger on the pants compared to my waist, which is perfect, it feels comfortable and when I'm full or bloated they don't get too tight. The shape flatters me personally but hey not all pant styles work for everyone.UPDATE:Repurchased 2 new colours in oct 2023 in 2 sizes up (33) as I have gained 30lbs and cant comfortably fit the 31's anymore.I can zip them up, but its tight tight since there is NO stretch in these jeans. I don't want stretch anyways, denim lasts much longer without it. The 31's are still in good condition and I do intend to drop weight butI'm updating this review to share the overall fit feeling is still the same as I felt when I first bought these pants so it shows that the grading of sizes as done well and you can shop with confidence.",
