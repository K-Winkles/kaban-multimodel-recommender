                "reviewText": "I\u2019m in love with these jeans. I have now bought 3 of the dark wash distressed and 3 of the acid wash/faded blue distressed. The photo is the dark wash. I usually buy a size 13 in juniors. I\u2019m a size 12 normally in women\u2019s. I could probably fit a size 10 but I don\u2019t like my clothes tight. So the dark wash I\u2019ve noticed are looser/maybe just stretchier. So my first order I got both in 13\u2019s. Second time around I bought 11\u2019s in the dark wash and 13 in the lighter. Wearing these nearly everyday (which is why I bought more lol) It just hit below triple digits in South Texas and wasn\u2019t sure if I could wear these without melting. I joked with my husband that the distressed holes were perfect ventilation. I felt nearly as cool as I would in shorts. The legs are a little wider along with stretchy.. but that\u2019s perfect since I have a more athletic/thicker build in my legs. Might be loose if you have thinner legs.",
