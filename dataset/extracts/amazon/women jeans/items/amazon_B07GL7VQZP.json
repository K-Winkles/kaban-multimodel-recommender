                "reviewText": "These jeans are so comfortable. I have first purchased size large and they seemed perfect. However, after wearing them and washing and drying them a couple of times, they ended up sagging off of my butt and being too big. I purchased a couple of mediums and they were really hard to get on after washing and drying them a couple of times and wearing them they have now stretched and fit perfect so I would definitely go smaller than you think you need because they do stretch out. Great jeans they have real pockets they\u2019re super comfortable. I\u2019ve bought every single color in a size medium that I could from the seller.",

I like them enough to keep them, but not enough to order another pair.",

I\u2019m 5\u20196 215lbs and carry a lot of my weight in the tummy area (trying to get rid of it) after 4 kids. Got these in 2XL although my suggested size was a 1XL I wanted a little wiggle room so that I don\u2019t suffocate when I sit. Just got them today tried them on and it feels great. It suppose to hug your curves and it does but I can still feel in my tummy area there\u2019s some give. I can sit i can eat and I\u2019m not dying to actually take them off. It may seem I could have gotten a 1XL buuut lemme get some pounds off and I\u2019ll try for a smaller size. I love how dark the blue is and the rips are in the right areas. The length is just right. Recommend buying. And for the price it\u2019s considered cheaper nowadays.",
