The fit is consistent and the stretch is just enough to make the fit comfortable. I like to buy long/tall and regular but could only get these in a regular. I will wear these with sandals or boots. I don't like the look of a lot of sock showing when I sit down. The regular length is fine when I am standing but pulls up just a little too far when I sit but the regular length is better when I wear boots or sandals. That's why I like to own multiple pairs. So, I will continue to look for this particular color in a tall.",

                "reviewText": "I've owned many pairs of Gloria Vanderbilt jeans over the years. I added 3 more pairs about 6 months ago - Black, Scottsdale Wash, and Rinse Noir Wash.I like these jeans because not only are they stylish and versatile, they're also durable and comfortable and fit well.They look great dressed up in heels or boots or dressed casual with sneakers and a T-shirt. There are so many colors and different washes available too. For the reasonable price, I am able to keep adding to my collection.Long term they hold up well to regular washing and don't seem to shrink in fit or length. I also don't notice any fading, even in the dark washes or black.I like the gold colored stitching used on the blue washes that I bought (Scottsdale Wash and Rinse Noir Wash). I think it makes a nice contrast.The workmanship is very good and the quality seems to hold up over time. The stitching is strong and the zippers work well.I love the fit of these jeans. I sometimes end up with jeans that have a gap around my waist. This isn't the case with these jeans, so I can go without a belt. This is nice because then I can wear longer shirts without a lump from my belt showing through.The material of the Black pair is a soft brushed type. It does sometimes attract more lint because of this.I bought my usual size in these and I think they fit true to size. I do think these run a little longer than other brands in length. However, I think they are the perfect length for heels and boots without being too long for flat shoes.One thing that I find inconsistent between the various colors and washes is the waist size. I added a picture to show the difference between the three pairs even though they are all the same size.Overall, I highly recommend these jeans!",

When I saw these at such a great price I purchased 2 pair, a week apart because I wanted to make sure they fit.The first pair was the black and exactly like the blacks I have purchased in Belk, Kohl\u2019s and Penny\u2019s, they run a little smaller but since I have lost 42 pounds over the last 7 months I was ok if they were smaller so I would have something for when I get down to a smaller size. To my surprise, the black pair actually wasn\u2019t that much smaller than my other 16W that I had purchased fromBelk and at Kohl\u2019s in December, once I lose 5 more pounds they will fit great in the waist.I decided to order another pair, this time in Portland Wash, a darker blue, these fit wonderfully. I will say I did order a 16W short and these are average but since I can sew, it won\u2019t be a big deal to cut it down and sew it to be the correct length.I just wish I could get a 14W for when I reach my next goal but I will go into a local store and try on the misses size to see what size I need to order from Amazon. Super fast delivery, even on the last one that indicated I wouldn\u2019t receive it until 1/23-1/31, I actually received it in 3 days.These jeans are perfect for a 72 year old woman to wear, very comfortable and flattering.",

                "reviewText": "First off, ignore the \u201cplus size\u201d in the description. I have no idea why that\u2019s included in it. Though there is a wide range of sizes available for these jeans, they are not exclusively plus size!Also\u2026these are *not* tapered, but rather boot cut style. I\u2019ve worn tapered for years. Tapered are cut much narrower to the ankle. While I\u2019d rather prefer it, it seems you can no longer find the actual tapered style any more. I\u2019ve not only searched here, but on eBay and in Kohls. Guess the manufacturer decided the description \u201cboot cut\u201d was less appealing, and now just call the formerly known boot cut style \u201ctapered\u201d (and thus, cut out having both styles, like they have for years). Par for the course on most everything these days, it seems.ALSO\u2026I would strongly use the \u201ctry before you buy.\u201d I bought a pair of these in April in size 10, they fit great. Now in November I bought a pair in size 10, too small in the waist, so I had to return and get a size 12. My figure/weight has *not* changed in that timeframe, so it makes no sense. But in recent years I have noticed the same thing in other clothing lines, not just with these jeans. Gotta try them all on almost all the time now to be sure they fit right. That\u2019s the way it is these days.Otherwise, these are the same good fitting, durable and comfortable jeans as always. I wear either a 10 or 12 in pants in general these days. The recent pair in size 10 was a bit too snug in the waist, 12 is perfect. Even though I went up a size this time, they fit fairly well all over, just a tad bit looser in hips and legs than I\u2019d prefer Oh well. (I\u2019m in my 60\u2019s, 5\u20196\u201d, 160, and have that awful spare tire and then some now that\u2026no matter what I try to do\u2026refuses to deflate or diminish. Really disappointing when you\u2019re used to fitting in an 8/10.)",
