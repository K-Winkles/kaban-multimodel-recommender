                "reviewText": "Just before pandemic closures bought a pair of these exact Wrangler\u2019s at Theissen\u2019s. My inseam is 35\u201d which makes these a wee bit long. My other pair got tethered at the bottom of one leg. They\u2019re my favorite so looked on Amazon rather then head to the store.Boom. There they were AND on sale. In the cart and in less then 24 hours on my door step.Immediately tried them on. Definitely keepers.A few differences I noticed. The pair from 2019 are my favorite jeans. But didn\u2019t get worn a lot due to closures. But they were worn enough to have a lived in vibe. They\u2019ve been washed a variety of times which adds to this comfortable feeling. This might be why they feel different.The original pair are super soft and the material is flexible in that unlike traditional stiff thick denim. They are thinner and feel like soft cotton sheets freshly laundered.The new pair material feels more like traditional denim. Not as thick. Not as soft. Washing may change this.This pair has stitching that is similar but more prominent thread. More noticeable. This also could be a wash and west difference.Overall side by side they\u2019re almost identical. On, the newer doesn\u2019t feel as flexible in the material. With some wearing this may change. They may get more soft over time.The new ones look great. Fit perfectly. Perfect length. Same pocket stitch on the back pockets.I\u2019m really happy I found these. For the $33 yet 24 hrs later price tag of $37 wish I would have bought a second pair. In store a few years ago they were slightly more. The regular price of $42 is store retail I recollect.Overall, other then a few variations am super happy with this purchase. Especially now that the tethered heel is renewed by having a new pair.If you\u2019re looking for a pair of jeans that will not be stiff and work with your figure if you lose or gain these May be your win.I was at the bottom of my weight class and my doctor asked me to gain weight concerned I was too thin. The paints worked with this change.I\u2019ve decided to lose a few because ten was too much. These pants don\u2019t require a new pair. They flex to fit. For me at least.If Wrangler continues to make these I\u2019ll keep buying.\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaf",

                "reviewText": "I am having trouble finding jeans that are mid-rise on my short-waisted body. My hips and waist are only about 1\" different, so I can't wear jeans with a small waist and bigger hips. I've been really happy with the Denizen by Levi's bootcut mid-rise jeans from Target until this past year. The sizing has been really inconsistent on the length and waist.The Wranglers are a bit more expensive than I usually go with, as they are mostly worn at work, but I ordered two pair to try. I ended up keeping the one that was a size smaller than the size chart indicated. When I first put them on, they were just a bit snug at the button, but I have been wearing them around the house for a few hours now and they are very comfortable. They hit about one inch below my belly button, which is important for me because I have scar tissue in that area, and I can't stand having the button dig in there. (I aslo ordered Sonoma from Kohl's, a different women's jean from Levi's, and Riders by Lee as well- they were supposed to be mid-rise. but they didn't fit me that way. High rise is out of the question for me. The waist would be just under my boobs and would make my rear look super long. lol no thank you.)I almost these 4 stars because of the look of the denim. It kind of has a cross-hatch appearance. It's not my favorite look, and I'm used to paying about $10 less for work jeans, but I am happy that I found something that I can comfortably wear for my 12-hr shifts at work, and they are comfortable enough to lounge around the house in.I am so thrilled that they offer these in different lengths. Not all women are the same height and I do not want to have to roll up or hem brand new jeans. I wear chunky shoes for work and like how the bootcut skims over the shoe and doesn't bunch up around my ankle. I've never worn Wranglers before, and I'm very happy that these don't have the W on the back pockets. Two Ws on my rear would look like an ad for Weight Watchers. haha. no thanks.Thank you, Wranglers! Now, don't discontinue these. :-)",
