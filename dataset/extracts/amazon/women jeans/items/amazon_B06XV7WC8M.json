They have enough give to fit to your body, but they don't stretch out and become sloppy looking. The fabric feels soft but very durable. I sized down as other reviewers recommended, and am glad that I did as these fit perfectly. I also appreciate being able to select for length - more savings not having to get them hemmed. I have jeans that cost 5 times as much that aren't as nice as these. Definitely new favorites.",

So, I figured 3-30 would be perfect and exchanged them. When I got the 3-30, it was too wide on my waist which didn\u2019t make sense. It also did not have good pockets like the other one. It had too much flare in the legs as well that looked funny.Also, both times I ordered the pants, they came in a thin, clear bag. That\u2019s it. That is not good shipping at all.",

I'm out the door fast on my in-office days and look crisp and pulled together in a flash. On top of all that, the comfort of jeans! I think these fit true to size. I wear a size 1 tall.

                "reviewText": "Overall I like these jeans. The sizing was correct for my measurements though slightly big, the jean material is heavy, soft and stretchy and the color is nice. I am a little disappointed that these have more of a curve in the hip than I like, and the bottom of legs is a little wider than i would have liked. But in the three days i have worn these so far I have gotten some complements in them so it can't be all bad. They are just slightly too big for me though length was spot on. I have a weird body, only 113 lbs 5' 5.75\" (basically 166\") and I have a tiny upper body with 5\" wrists but I have a large butt and hold all my muscle in my thighs and butt which makes it hard to find pants that fit right so while most people my weight wear a size 0-2 I usually wear a size four. It can be iffy though, sometimes size 4 is slightly too tight in butt/hips unless I drop a few lbs and exercise like a madwoman (getting ever harder at my age of 49 lol). So I was thrilled to find an odd sizing. But as it turns out these are just slightly too big, mostly in the hips. On the bright side I can wear long johns under them here in NE Minnesota. I like more of a straight leg boot cut mid rise. The mid rise on these is very decent and hugs my body. But the curves make butt/legs slightly baggy and makes me look heavier which I dislike. I will say these are more comfortable than many jeans. Not 100% what I was looking for but getting close.",

The 9 - 34 (went on my other Wranglers size jeans which are 8s) are just right for me, I wanted to be able to wear these with heels/wedges (3-4 inches) and they are just the right length, the 32s would be perfect for a cute pair of flats. Soft material and the dark denim is the perfect color. If you were wondering like I was, these are the jeans that are showcased in the video reel under the product images. Also, ladies, my husband thinks they are really nice and in his words \"make my booty look great\". Can't complain about jeans that do a booty good! Lol!",

                "reviewText": "The positives are: my package arrived way earlier then estimated at the time of ordering. Got it in 5 days, instead of a month. The look of the jeans I kind of like, with the stylish, wide detail on the bottom of the pants. I also like the color. The length is OK, could be a 1/2 inch longer, but would still keep it, if everything else were OK. (I am 5.8 and 145 LBs and bought the size 9/32)The negatives: I have serious doubts about the 99% cotton statement. I have 99% cotton 1% elastane pants, and compering the 2 side by side I am confident that these are not 99% cotton. These seem more like my 78% cotton, 20% polyester and 2% elastane Lewi's boyfriend pants I have (which material I do NOT prefer). Also, the fit is not right for me, there is a gap at the back, and these ride down when sitting. They are wide on the waist area, but fit everywhere else. Also, at the front crouch area there is a strange pouch look, and the overall feeling is like wearing a plastic bag. I do not care much for the back pocket stiches; the light thread color makes this jeans look cheap looking to me, also the pockets sit wider apart than on any other jeans I have, that makes these not very flattering. Very disappointing to me, expected more... especially based on the description and reviews. Unfortunately, these are going back.",

When I had ordered another pair of these jeans in my regular size 9 they were way too small\u2026 I\u2019m thinking this is ridiculous\u2026 so I order a size 11 in these same jeans. They arrive and I put them on and they\u2019re way too small. I put them up against the earlier jeans that I purchased in size 9, which were to small, and they are the same exact size. These jeans are actually a size 7 jean and they are both mislabeled as a 9 and 11. What is going on?",
