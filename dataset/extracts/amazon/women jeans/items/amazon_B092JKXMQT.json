I do Not like to wear \"Old worn out\" cloths to a big or important event. the pocket edges and hems have a tattered/ worn look to them, the upper thigh area has the \" washed out creased look to them - not pleased.

They were also a tad too long for me so I returned for a 4-30. These are so tight through the waist, hip, and thigh that I can barely zip them and they look painted on. At least the length is correct?? Unsure of whether to try and return and order again since these were both supposed to be a 4. I like the style a lot and they are good jeans but it should be this hard to find a pair that fits.",

I stopped ordering GV because all I could find were super tight on the legs. I would really prefer the bootcut I used to buy, but these straight leg are ok. I did also try Levi's and those were not a good fit for my rear, too low in the back and too stretchy and always falling down but the legs would stick on my calves.One thing I don't understand about these is the price seems high as compared to the other brands mentioned. I am not saying they aren't worth it, as I am a seamstress and you couldn't pay me enough to make a pair of jeans. I hope they hold up for many washings, is all.",
