I recently had surgery and missed the return window for this item so now I am stuck with something that I cannot wear. I would really appreciate if this company could offer me a solution such as an exchange. I am happy to update my rating once I receive satisfaction from customer service. Thank you",

So why would the maker think cutting the knee area much more narrow than the rest of the leg? I never shop for jeans thinking 'Let me buy some jeans that don't allow for my knees to bend'.",

                "reviewText": "I loved the style, so ordered my usual size. Could not even get them up over my hips. So, I exchanged for a size up. I got those on, but they were very tight on my calves & thighs, and I couldn\u2019t do them up. At this point, I\u2019m still loving the style, and went ahead and ordered both 2 & 3 sizes up. Both of these fit better in the legs. 2 sizes up fit and the waist, while 3 sizes up was too big. Both created a really unflattering poof look at my crotch area. Sadly, all going back, and I, personally, am extremely dissatisfied with Levi\u2019s for being so off on these.**I am 5\u201911\u201d and normally wear a 20. I am fairly straight up & down - not a huge belly or hips, etc. *****If you have thinner legs, and a bigger belly, they may very well work for you. I\u2019d still suggest starting out with 1, or even 2 sizes up. ***",
