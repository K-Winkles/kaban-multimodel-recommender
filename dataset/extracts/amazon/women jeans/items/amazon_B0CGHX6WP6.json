I really love the wash of the jeans and how comfortable they are to wear. I usually wear a size 2 or 4, so I opted to get the size 3 in these thinking that it would be a safe bet. However, they run a bit large so they don\u2019t accentuate my curves as well as I was hoping them to. I think if I had ordered one size down, that would have been better. For reference, I am 5\u20193 and 130lbs. Hope that helps!",
