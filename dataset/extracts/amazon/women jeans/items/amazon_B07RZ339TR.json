                "reviewText": "This is my first purchase of a pair of \"skinny jeans\" so I was a bit concerned about what size I really needed, plus every brand can fit differently. When I took my measurements I landed in the women's size 22 even though I usually wear size 20. I played it safe and went with the larger size and they're fine. I also prefer an elastic waist and this pair has a regular waistband and zipper so that was another reason I went with the size 22. There is enough stretch to this fabric that I honestly think either size would have worked for me. I'd say go with your regular size. I'm 5'4 and the length was just right.",

                "reviewText": "As others mentioned you need to order a size up. I did and they fit perfect!! So glad I read reviews so I did not have to return!! I usually wear a size 20. I ordered 22 in the nightingale. They were darker than the picture showed. I guess that is OK. I love the fit and very comfortable. I always wash my clothes when I get them before I wear them. They did not shrink. If they did.. definitely not noticeable. I definitely recommend them!",
