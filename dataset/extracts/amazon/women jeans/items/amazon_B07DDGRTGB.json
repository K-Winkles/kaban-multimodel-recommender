I ordered a couple of pair of Lucky Brand jeans using the \"try before you buy\" option. I kept this pair and sent the other (different style) back. This style is a skinny jean. It's stretchy but doesn't lose shape or stretch out if you wear them all day. I'm short waisted so I have a hard time wearing high rise jeans and usually opt for low rise, the mid rise on these sit comfortably. I'm super critical of jeans....the back pockets have to be \"right\" or you get the weird looking butt thing going on or your butt looks like it's 2 miles long. These passed the test",

So, I decided I needed to own another pair. I assumed they would fit the same, and when I first tried them on they felt good. But as I wore them the waist was not as snug and they continued to loosen and then started to slide. I hate that feeling and I hate wearing a belt... but with these, I will have to. I also hate not being able to depend on a brand when it comes to fit. I had hoped Lucky Brand would have been more reliable. So, just be careful. Although the style is the same (just a different color), the cut is not. Test each pair before you commit. Unfortunately, these will just be another pair I pass over to find my favorite Ava's.",
