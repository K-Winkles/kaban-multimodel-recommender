This Bandolino jeans came up when I searched Amanda Jean and I took a chance on it. I get a lot of compliments on them. They fit fine and have a lot of stretch. They are actually looser than my Amanda Jeans of the same size so I have to hike them back up from time to time but not a big deal. They are very comfortable.",

If the product changes, the description and photo should change as well.I am very disappointed and will be looking elsewhere for my jeans in the future.",
