The sizing was a little difficult because the reviews were mixed but I ended up getting a 6 and it is a little snug around the belly area but nothing a little shimmying couldn\u2019t fix. I wish there was a size in between 6-8 but I digress.I love these pants, I wear them constantly and I do recommend.They color is exactly like the picture.",

As a short person who hates cutting the hems off of new jeans, I am extremely disappointed to see thats what I received. I was expecting a finished cropped leg that would be a normal length for me at 5'3''.The good: These jeans fit very well. They are flattering and are a nice alternative to the wide leg jeans I've been wearing lately. I am keeping them because they fit well but I am glad I purchased them on sale. I would absolutely return these on principal except for how well they fit.",

Only 69% cotton with too much polyester and rayon, which equals too much stretch. Does not have the jeans feel. It\u2019s like the manufacturer discovered that the fabric was sewn inside out, never bothered to hem them and sold them to Amazon rather than the brand, which is Wrangler. I haven\u2019t decided whether or not to keep these pants. Someone thought it was a great idea to ruff up each of the back pockets.",
