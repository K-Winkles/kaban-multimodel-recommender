                "reviewText": "*Pictures are of both the light blue and darker blue color shorts*For reference I\u2019m 5\u20194\u201d 135ish lbs pear shape with short legs. These shorts run a little big. I first ordered the size 27 (my normal size) and they fit a little big and stretched out during the day. They were do-able, but I felt I needed to size down. I went down to a size 26 and they fit perfectly. When first putting them on they are a little snug but they stretch out. I\u2019m normally a size 4/6. The 26 fits great even after stretching out during the day and after being washed. They are really good quality and very comfortable. Nice thick stretchy material on the dark wash. They hold up fantastic in the wash. The length is really good- not too short! I think the inseam is about 4\u201d and the cuffs are sewn into place. I have short, big legs and these don\u2019t ride up constantly. I don\u2019t have to worry about them being too short when I bent over chasing after my toddler. I hate short shorts! These are the best shorts for everyday mom activities. I just ordered the light wash and I\u2019m definitely ordering more pairs!Update: I received the light wash and love them just as much as the dark wash! The sizing is the same on both. I now have 4 pairs of the dark wash 2 pair of the light wash because I wear these all the time. You can dress them down with a T-shirt and sneakers or slightly dress them up with a cute blouse and sandals.",

                "reviewText": "When I first got these shorts I took them out of the bag and they looked like they were going to be WAY too small. I listened to the other reviewers and ordered two sizes down from my normal size 10, so I ordered the 29 instead of 31 like I normally would. (I\u2019m 5\u20198, 153 lbs). Well, I tried them on & they fit me perfectly! BUT....they were WAY too short for this fifty-something chick, measuring at about a 4 inch inseam, NOT 4.5 like the description. Um. Yeah. No way. I just don\u2019t feel comfortable wearing shorts that short. They come pre-cuffed and they are stitched at the side seams. Well, I pulled out my handy dandy seam ripper from my sewing kit and I very carefully cut the threads holding the fabric cuffed. Much to my delight, I found out that the hem is finished...stitched in white thread, a nice look, and they won\u2019t fray. Not that I would have minded the frayed look, but I can do that myself and I already have several pairs of cut off jean shorts with a frayed hem. The best part is that by unrolling them it took the shorts down to 7 inches instead of 4 inches like they started out! Score! These are cute, comfortable, stylish, and the perfect length if you unroll the cuff.",

I\u2019m an older woman (well over 55) and I was looking for something cute and flattering but wouldn\u2019t show my saggy upper thigh skin.

(Size 27) When they arrived, they fit perfectly and give me enough length coverage that I needed and I didn\u2019t feel like I was hanging out of them. They are well-made and the style is great.",

They fit a little loose everywhere, like boyfriend shorts should. They definitely stretch a bit more as you wear them. They are not tight around the waist so if you have a smaller waist, they'll be loose there too and hang more on your hips. The inseam is long enough that my shorts legs stay in place and don't look like their creeping up into unspeakable places. I think they are great shorts if you're looking for comfortable but not too sloppy short. If you want a tighter fit, I think you could probably go down a size from your usual size.",
