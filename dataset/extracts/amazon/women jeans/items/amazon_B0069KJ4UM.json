I was two hours from home and had to leave the event I'd paid to be at before I even got to experience the event. I wore those pants because they were new and had literally five hours of wear. This ruined my day and wasted a whole lot of my time and money. A new pair of jeans should last at LEAST a few months, but these lasted a handful of hours. I wasn't even doing anything extreme. I was walking up stairs when it happened. I was in a car for most of the time I wore them. These jeans were so trash that they couldn't handle even basic activities. I will never buy this brand again.",

They were out of the short in my size when I ordered.I\u2019ll definitely order more of these! Perfect for a curvy girl with a larger hip/behind. They look amazing on and I feel amazing in them.",

                "reviewText": "These look and fit great but after just a few wears, they started ripping at the back pockets - just a clean vertical tear along the inner side of each pocket for no apparent reason. I patched them a bit but it made me realize, all my Aura jeans have ripped prematurely over the years (these the earliest yet). Not sure if it's the stretchy ingredients that allow more tearing? I think I might have to go a different route but for now I have like five patchy pairs.Another thing to note (doesn't bother me) is the fit varies pretty drastically from the time you first wash them to wash time. I put them on fairly fitted and by dinner they sag a bit and I can pull them off without unzipping.",
