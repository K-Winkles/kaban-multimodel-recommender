They sculpt and hug and best of all, stay in place all day! They are the perfect length on my tall frame and have just enough stretch in the legs to make playing on the floor with my toddler fun. They are comfortable enough for my home days and sophisticated enough for date night. No regrets!",

                "reviewText": "These fit as expected for their sizes - I purchased a size 6 and 8 since many reviews said to size down. Wish I wouldn't have - I actually wish I had ordered a size UP to see how the 10s would have fit.Pros:\u2022 Very flattering on me\u2022 Correct length and fit\u2022 Plenty of stretchCons:\u2022 Finish has some pokey bits that felt scratchy - if you're highly sensitive to things like this (like me), they would drive you nuts if you tried to wear them all day\u2022 Fairly thin - I could see underwear lines through them easily and they didn't necessarily feel like wearing \"jeans\"\u2022 Crotch area was too confining - I like a little room down there, especially for sitting down and being comfortable. These were too \"up in there\" in that area even when standing, so again, wouldn't recommend if you're sensitive to this type of thing.Overall, if you're usually able to throw on anything and be comfortable, these will probably be awesome for you, as they're much more stretchy and flattering than many jeans. If you're more sensitive, there are a couple of things that you may not like. I would NOT recommend sizing down.",

Love them, and will buy more when the price goes down.",
