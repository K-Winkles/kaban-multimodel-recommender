Not only are they comfortable but they are very stylish and I absolutely fell in love with them as soon as I put them on. It is made of good quality and they are stretchy so it gives you room to move around then and just overall looks great on the body. It's a very flattering pair of jeans. The color is nice and it goes well it pairs well with any top and you can dress it up or dress them down I really like these for that reason. Overall I would say I am a very happy camper with these and would recommend them to anyone that asks.",

                "reviewText": "As the headline say, the name fits, because these are in fact a Fine Value. The thing I'm most pleased with is these are the first jeans I've bought that didn't have a numbered size, but the fit makes sense. Usually a size XXL, especially in these types of jeans, ends up being a size 8. But My normal comfortable size is 18-20 and these XXL are the absolute perfect fit for me. Though i will say they may end up a little long on most because I'm extra tall. But the way they're made anyone could just cut them to length and let them fray again. I do really adore the fit, and most of my complaints would be that I prefer high waisted, but these aren't listed as that, so no fault of their own. These are a true mid rise, right at or under the belly button. Looking in the mirror I'm very pleased with how they look out back, really accentuates instead of flattening me out like some jeans do. And just WAIT until you see how big and deep the front pockets are! You could easily fit your whole smartphone in there without any sticking out, including the Plus models. The denim itself actually feels really nice quality, not super thin, but it is super stretchy. The color does match what I saw on my screen, so you shouldn't have much to worry about there. All that said, the zipper is not the best. The flap is wonky, but might be fixed with an iron, I haven't tried that yet. But it's also sticky and isn't very easy to move up and down. I wouldn't let that stop you from getting a pair though, definitely worth the money.",

Unfortunately, they are not flattering or form fitting. Due to the fact that the pants are stretchy they tend to sag in places you\u2019d want them to hug like around the thighs and butt region. Also, because the pants are stretchy, the material tends to bunch up in the crotch area.",
