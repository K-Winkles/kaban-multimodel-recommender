In the normal course of wearing them if you bend over or move to get out of a car, etc. they will begin to slide down. In fact, if you don\u2019t pull them up they will fall off. When sitting down the back of them goes down close to the buttocks. They are impossible to wear for everyday usual activities. They were selling at around $17.00. This is a good example of the adage \u201cYou get what you pay for and you pay for what you get\u201d. Don\u2019t buy! They\u2019re a waste of money! SHAME ON THE SELLERS!",
