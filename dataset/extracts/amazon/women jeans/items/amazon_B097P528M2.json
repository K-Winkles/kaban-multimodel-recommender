                "reviewText": "I read many reviews stating that the blue camo ran quite small so size up. I understand that different color bottoms tend to run odd in sizes. But to read someone saying that they could barely get their leg in is how small this ran was ridiculous. I sized up. For one, just looking at them out of the package I could see that they were huge. I washed and dried in \"hot water\". Something I never do. But I desperate for them to fit. Another review state that the pants were so dark that the camo wasn't even visible. SMH. The camo print is very noticeable. Overall, I love these pants. After washing and drying I tried them on, and they do sort of fit. But not quite the way I like them. To sum this review up in a nutshell. I very well could have just bought my normal size. Especially seeing a different camo color other than your basic green was refreshing. I'm 5'2\" @110 lbs. medium build with chunky thighs. The length was ok. Not too long. These would have fit and look much better had I bought my usual size. This is just my opinion. Every body type is different, yes. But we must have a general idea of what size we are and if the description says they run small, buy accordingly. But not so much based on reviews. I gave five stars because there is nothing wrong with these pants. The material is descent. Don't look or feel cheap at all. The sizing issue has nothing to do with the product itself. It's my poor judgement based on the reviews.",

The pictures showed a lower rise, these pants have an extremely high rise and an unflattering fit on a plus size body.",

I\u2019m short, so of course there\u2019s a little bit of bunching at the ankles, but I\u2019m used to it and I actually like it. If you are short, you can always turn them under, if you don\u2019t like the bunching. They are stretchy and comfortable. And the color is perfect! I ordered the red.I do want to point out one thing - they are advertised as butt lifting, but I really think to say that is a bit of a stretch. I\u2019ve had other jeans that didn\u2019t make that claim that did a better job of that than these. However, I bought them for the stretch the color and the size, which I love, so I didn\u2019t remove a star because my but wasn\u2019t \u201clifted\u201d.",

I'm 110 lbs, 5'4, and ordered a size 3 in Navy, they fit like a dream, so of course I came back to order more colors because its so hard to find low cut, or mid-rise jeans. I have a short torso and high waisted sits right under my boobs. Now, the white size 3 is more like a 1. Too tight. I'm so happy I finally found the low cut or mid-rise pants in lots of colors, but the size is a hit or miss. I'm going up 1 size in the White. You may want to order in both sizes and just send the one that doesn't fit back because I think it all depends on the color you order. So that's the good and the bad, but It's worth it If you find the right size.. you'll love them.",

The jean is also a bit long and leaves a little too much extra material around the thighs. I'd say don't be afraid to go a size smaller from your true size for a perfect fit. I'll order smaller next time. The color is great and the waist does feel good and kind of gives me a slimming effect.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered a pair of 5S red pants and they fit absolutely perfectly, and they are so comfortable\u2014 for that review I give 5 stars\u2026 so I really wanted a white pair, but they only make the short lengths for a few colors. Since most brands don\u2019t vary the other measurements in their sizes\u2014only the length\u2014I ordered a regular length size 5 in white. I was so disappointed I am apple shaped and everything I gain goes straight to my upper body and none of it goes to my hips or legs. Currently I fit in the healthy weight range for my BMI, but I know I look better when I was 10 pounds thinner. After a few years of fighting it I\u2019m trying to just accept it and buy new clothes. here are my horrifying measurements\u2014 bust 38, waist 31 (ok probably 32 at night) hips 34\u2013 no joke\u2014 my hips are currently barely 3 inches wider than my fat waist. So when I was 10 pounds thinner my measurements were 35, 28, 34\u2013 so I\u2019m the worst apple ever where nothing ever goes to my hips or butt. If jeans are low rise I can wear size 2, but high rise jeans at this weight I have to wear 6-8 or I can\u2019t breath. Problem is that when I get those sizes they billow with extra fabric on my hips and butt and make me look awful. That\u2019s why I was so excited the red 5S fit so well. But the white regular length size pinched my middle completely even though they were still midrise. So I returned them and ordered size 7 and they still pinched but not as bad as the 5, only they were ridiculously long and more baggy in the hip than I like. Maybe my red pair of size 5S is a fluke. I don\u2019t know cuz I don\u2019t need or want the other colors they sell in that size. If the company reads these, please make more colors (tons of women love white jeans!) of the short size\u2026assuming they\u2019re the same measurements as my perfect stretchy red pair shown in pics. My rating of 3 stars is due to not being able to get an awesome fit in a different color. Sorry I didn\u2019t do all the measurements for the white pairs before I sent back.",
