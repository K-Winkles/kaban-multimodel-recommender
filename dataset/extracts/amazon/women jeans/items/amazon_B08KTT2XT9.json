I\u2019m 5 foot 5 and I weigh maybe 185 and the size 14 fits fine. Almost big in the butt and legs but the waist is good. I think it\u2019s a straight cut and not a curvy cut. They wash up fine and don\u2019t shrink. They stay looking new. For a long time. The ones I bought 5 years ago are barely wearing out and I only have two pair and I wear the heck out of them. These are the same quality. They have a stretch. The zipper is good. The pockets aren\u2019t yucky. I have hips and a big butt and these get loose and kind of sag when I stand after sitting which is why I need a belt. They don\u2019t pinch or cut anywhere and with this extra weight that sure is a welcome thing. I got the 32 inch inseam and they\u2019re perfect. 30 would have been too short. Next time I may order a 12 just to see how they fit. If you\u2019re not sure about getting these I would say just try them.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, I like these pants. The pair made in Bangladesh are particularly comfortable. They have a lot of stretch. The black dye has definitely faded more in those versus the pair made in Pakistan. However, neither pair looks gray to me. They both look like just faded black jeans.I'm not sure about the sizing. As you can see, the one pair is clearly marked as 31, instead of 32. They are noticeably tighter and less comfortable. However they are both supposed to be the same size 12M when I ordered them. I think for the money, they're both worth it. It's honestly really hard to find pants that I feel good in, and these have the right amount of stretch and structure without spending a Ben. I will likely order them again. The closest I found to these previously were Dickies skinny jeans. Those seemed very consistent.I still don't feel comfortable wearing anything too tight or short on top wearing these because I don't think it's flattering to my figure and size - Apple shape, usually in a 16 after having a child. However, as an apple shape, these are much better than many other pants, particularly any of the stretchy yoga leggings. I can at least wear a belt with these. They definitely want to creep down if I don't.Worth a try on, at least. Hey.. if they don't fit, it's an easy return with Prime.",

Like it\u2019s a NIGHTMARE trying to find jeans :( I\u2019m usually a size 10 (but again, perpetually dissatisfied with fit even then) but I got a size 8 in these thinking I could squeeze in with my shapewear and that way they would fit my waist while also not looking like parachute pants from the waist down. And sister. These are IT!! Tight on my legs, perfect fit on my waist, and the camel toe has been dismissed completely. And they fit like that WITHOUT THE SHAPEWEAR??? I think these jeans might have a little witchcraft sewn in tbh :p",
