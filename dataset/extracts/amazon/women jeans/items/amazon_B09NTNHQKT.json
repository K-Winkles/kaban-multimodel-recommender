                "reviewText": "I am 9 weeks postpartum and the belly is still there. As I am getting back to where I use to be, this Jean is flexible and comfortable. My c-section scar isn't bothered or hurting by the waistband since it sits higher. I did have to order the Jean in a \"short\" and I am 5 ft 6 in. I have always worn a \"regular\" Jean, so this was new to me. The \"short\" hit my ankle perfectly though. As I get my body back, I will order more in sizes that accommodate the different stages of my body.",

                "reviewText": "They seem to get softer with every wash. They stretch some so they are great for eating out, lol. I love the soft waistband, doesn't dig into your stomach. I wear petite/short and its very hard to find comfortable jeans in my size AND the length I need. They fit so well that I reordered these jeans several times but the last time the jeans seemed 2 sizes too small. The right size was ordered but I couldn't even get them on. I don't know why the big difference in the size so I didnt give them 5 stars. The good thing was I used the \"try before you buy\" option and returned them the next day. I'm planning on reordering the same size to see if it was a manufacturing error. If it's an option before you purchase, use the \"try before you buy\" to avoid sizing issues.",

The button area is a little odd, but I haven't noticed the weird \"manly parts\" issue others have mentioned. I wear them mostly with boots, but they look cute with a little cuff and flats. They are a smidgen long for me at regular length, hence needing to cuff them a little.",
