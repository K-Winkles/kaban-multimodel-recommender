They flatter my shape and aren\u2019t too big. At first they were tight, but they loosened up nicely after a few minutes. Now they are comfortable. The jeans are of very good quality. Not thin at all. But there is no stretch. The color is a nice medium denim color. For size reference I am 5\u20193 152 lbs with 41 inch hips. I have a meaty belly. And I got my usual size 29 (8) If I had gone up a size, they would have been unflattering throughout the thighs. Length is ok. Not too long but I did have to cuff them a little. Nothing crazy. I really like these jeans and I plan to order more colors.",

                "reviewText": "Although i returned them due to sizing being off these jeans are great quality and super cute. I am a very curvy female so jeans without stretch are hard for me. my waist is 2 sizes smaller than my hips and booty so it makes it hard to find jeans that fit. Measure before ordering. I wanted these to work so bad. Love the button fly",

I didn't realize the \"style\" was having the bottom hem cut off on the legs. So many hanging threads my toes kept getting stuck and I couldn't get my leg through the pant leg. Plus having the bottom of the pant leg cut off makes them too short. Not a true 30 inch length making them too short.Why is it so hard to find normal brown cotton jeans? Sending these back.",

I just love the look of these jeans. The straight leg style is perfect ,not too wide not too skinny. These size 27 s were a replacement for size 28 in another style. The 28's were a few inches too big. They advise to size up but for me the sizing is actually right this time since I usually buy size 4/6 (Levi's 27/28).",
