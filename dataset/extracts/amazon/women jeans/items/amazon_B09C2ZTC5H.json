                "reviewText": "The good:1. The inseam is super long!!! I\u2019m 6\u2019 tall and the length was perfect!2. These jeans are incredibly stretchy. My hips measure roughly 48\u201d around. I ordered an XXL (hip measurement 47.25\u201d) and can easily pull the waistband out another 4\u201d after both washing and drying on the hot cycle. So I\u2019m guessing the sizing guide gives the relaxed non-stretched measurement. I would order a size down next time.3. The proportions are just right for curvy butts/hips and narrow waists! I have a 37\u201d waist, and had no issues with gapping.The bad:1. The fabric is thinner than a name brand jean (ie. Levi, Wrangler, etc.) but doesn\u2019t feel cheap. Combine that with the stretch and there\u2019s no real support. Bigger gals wanting a high waisted jean that keeps everything tucked in and tight may be a little disappointed. You\u2019ll need to make a strategic underwear decision if you\u2019re feeling bloated.2. The fringe on the bottom curls up and folds over in the dryer. The cuffed look was cute, but I\u2019m tall and need those extra inches! I remedied this by spritzing a little water on the hems and unrolling them after I got dressed. It worked, but I\u2019d like to not add any extra steps to my morning routine.The verdict:Over all, I\u2019m pleased with my purchase. I\u2019ll be wearing control top panties with these jeans and ordering a size down next time.",
