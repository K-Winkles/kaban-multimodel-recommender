                "reviewText": "I have reviewed the Beverly light wash on another seller listing. Bought a size 9 Long and they fit perfectly in all colors! Super soft and stretching and sits slightly under the belly button so not the super high waist, just right and no gapping in the back, great for an hourglass shape. For reference: I'm 5.8\" about 32-33\" waist, 42-43\" largest part of my hips/bum. The LONG is actually 29\" inseam, all the colors I purchased was the same. Though the regular promise a 29\" inseam you will end up with a 27\". That is the only thing with though pants. So keep that in mind with ordering. Don't hesitate to get those if you are curvy and can't find proper skinny jeans that are too tight in the butt and thighs, these fits like a second skin.",

                "reviewText": "For reference, I'm 5'8\" waist 32-33\" and 42-43 hips/bum (at the largest). Bought a 9 LONG and fits perfectly. The only thing is the inseam not being as indicated. The labels are all correct so it's not a labeling mistake. I ordered the long and they come to a 29 1/4 instead of 31\". For me that was good because I wanted 29\" not 31 - This 2 inches shorter than indicated applies to both these long jeans and regular skinny ones none high waisted as well (regular 27.5\" instead of 29\"). Besides that they are nice and stretchy, I prefer the high-waisted sassy over the regular ones, I feel they fit much better. I am going to buy more colors and hope they feel and fit as well as these.",
