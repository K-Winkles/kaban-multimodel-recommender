I was in shock when Amazon suggested the size 6. I'm always afraid to trust those suggestions. But I went with all their sizing suggestions this time and I ordered 4 different pair of pants. These pants are definitely going to be my favorite pair. I love the color and the fit. There was only one issue with the pants and it was the waist was a little loose but they don't fall down and I don't have to keep tugging at them to keep them pulled up. I can fit my hand in-between my belly and the pants and still have a little room but they aren't falling down. This is my first pair of women's jeans I've bought in 3 years and they make me feel like I've taken over the world. \ud83d\ude1c I would definitely reorder these pants when time comes.",

As I was researching this purchase, more than one review suggested going up a size. Normally I fit smack dab in a size 6, however, the 8 fit more comfortably around the waist. Ofcourse, everyone is different, however, if there is an option to try before you buy, you may want to order 2 sizes from the get go to save time. Traditionally a boot cut gal, this first venture into slim fit jeans ended up being a flattering choice. 5'4\" 28\" waist, 36\" hips.",

I checked the size to make sure I didn\u2019t have my daughters jeans and they are the jeans I ordered but the size tag says 30x30 which is a size 12 not 16. So keep that in mind whoever is picking the orders are not converting the sizes correctly. Now I will say I like the jeans and I\u2019m going to keep them to motivate me to my goal weight. They are a nice color but just keep in mind they shrink and sizing is off.",

They definitely did nothing positive for my particular menopausal figure. I love the colour and the overall quality of the material but sadly, I have to return them as a complete alteration would mean taking them apart and re-sewing them, which would be too expensive.
