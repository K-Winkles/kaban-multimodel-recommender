                "reviewText": "I hate high waisted jeans, they're uncomfortable in the waist area and they're dorky-looking so these are nice in that aspect. Unfortunately, I had to sort of guess at what size to get since the size chart includes 'natural waist' measurements but these are low rise jeans so they don't even reach my natural waist. I'm not sure why that measurement is even on the size chart. Also, the sizes to choose from mention the waist like 28W x 33L, 25W x 30L, etc. Shouldn't it really be 28H x 33L, 25H x 30L and so on, instead of W? I don't know.Anyway, I sort of had to guess at what size to get due to that and wound up with jeans that are too large for me. I think the options wound up making me choose my waist size instead of my hip size, but I don't know why that would make the pants large on me, unless the jeans are just sized bigger. I can easily pull these on and off without unbuttoning or unzipping, but the jeans are comfortable and don't feel too heavy. I've never been a fan of the manufactured distressed look but these jeans have a touch of that with a few small spots of purposely roughed-up surfaces. Thankfully, they didn't overdo it.So while the sizing was weird for me to figure out, the jeans themselves are nice and comfortable and I'm happy to use these as my new fat pants! Maybe choose your size based on your hips instead of your waist in order to get a more accurate size. Unless I'm misinterpreting the sizes but I don't think so. Just make sure to really look at the size options and try to figure out which one might work for you.",

                "reviewText": "These Silver jeans are excellent quality! The denim fabric is strong and has a medium-heavy weight, so the fabric is definitely meant to withstand regular wearing and machine washing. The seams and top-stitching are tightly stitched and most are double-stitched. The fit is nice, but seems a little large in the waist and thigh. I used the size chart on the Silver Jeans web site and ordered the size recommended by the chart, but I probably should have ordered a 28 waist instead of a 29. However, since most jeans fit tighter when they are machine washed and dried, I'm not going to worry about that. The cut is very flattering, and I will definitely be buying more!",

I'm not saying we should go back to the early 2000s fit, but these are a great compromise and are perfectly proportioned. The length is just right, and the cut of the leg is absolutely right.
