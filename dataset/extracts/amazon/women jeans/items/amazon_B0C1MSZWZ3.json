                "reviewText": "The pants are ok for the price. You can't expect much for this low price. The crotch is extremely long so I have to pull them way up on my waist to fit. The most noticeable thing was as soon as I opened the bag I was blasted with a very offensive odor. The pants absolutely reek. It smells like manure. I've washed them twice and they still stink. I don't understand what would cause that but I'll keep washing them.",

They\u2019re beautiful I do love them I just wish they fit the rest of my body better. I ordered a size 8, which is my normal size however, I think I would\u2019ve got a size 6 next time.
