I\u2019m tall, 5\u201910\u201d, and it\u2019s hard to find pants that are long enough. I am all legs!!! These are a great price, are super comfy (I wear them for work), make my butt look good, go plenty past my ankles (but don\u2019t drag on floor) and fit in all the right places. Definitely recommend these!! Love Lee\u2019s, wish their skinny jeans came in a 34\u201d length or at least had their 32\u201d length skinny jeans in stock.",

I got the stretchy ones and five different colors and I love them!!! I got two pairs of blacks for my second job and they're so comfortable and durable and I just love them!! Prices excellent.
