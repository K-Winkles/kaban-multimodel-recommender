They fit true to size for me. The one con is that, like others have stated, they have a chemical smell, but I\u2019m keeping them because I like them a lot. I will wash them several times if I need to, to get the chemical smell out.",

Received second pair and they are used! Not one tag on it, and the knees were stretched - you know how jeans look after wearing\u2026 I\u2019m not against buying used clothing but not at full price and the only option is to return AGAIN and reorder. Wanted for a specific occasion so that won\u2019t happen sadly.That aside- these jeans are cute and comfortable and I really liked them just not sure if I\u2019m going to try one more time",
