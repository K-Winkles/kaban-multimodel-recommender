I ended up keeping the size I ordered out of laziness of returning and I assume it\u2019s supposed to be a little looser bc of the \u201cbf fit\u201d. But I def have to pull them up quite often or wear a belt. My waist is 28\u201d and my hips are 39\u201d. I usually wear a 38 or 39 but should\u2019ve sized down. Besides that they are comfy, cute, and perfect length. I am 5\u20193 and a half. They smell like new denim but will probably be fine after a wash or two! Not a bad price for true Levi\u2019s.",

I ordered my regular size 10 and they fit perfect just not baggy like my deconstructed pair that I had ordered in the past. Since these don't have the rips and tares, they seem a little more appropriate for work or maybe you could dress them up a bit with a cute tee and a blazer. The denim is a good weight and they have some decent stretch to them. Not too flimsy like some pairs that I have purchased. I'm pleased with them and may order another pair in a darker color. I would suggest these to family and friends!",

They smell like when clothes are left for too long in the washer machine\u2014or water or moisture seeped into the plastic packaging. That was the only disappointing part. The cut fits well and I ordered them larger because I like this style a little looser/baggy; however, they are too baggy and I wish I had ordered a size or two down. Really like the quality of the jeans overall.",

Probably is my fault tho for not measuring the length but I was REALLY a hoping they\u2019d be long enough on me to roll up a bit, just like the pictures and the models WITH their heights labeled under the photos\u2026 but they look more like capris\u2026 not the look I\u2019m going for with my boots\u2026 I love the tears, the color, and how soft they are! ESPECIALLY love the sale they\u2019re on (refer to pics for original retail price), but I think I\u2019ll return them because they\u2019re not what I was hoping they\u2019d be!",

                "reviewText": "I imagine that everyone struggles with finding jeans that fit their body perfectly and you are probably familiar with the struggle of trying on every different brand you can find before finding one that works for you and for me that is Levis. So I went to Kohl's in search of Levi's capris and found these. They have the perfect amount of stretch and fit me beautifully in my normal size 16 but I only purchased one pair because they were $70! Then I came home and got on Amazon to find another pair. I found these at half the price in the color that I purchased; unfortunately, when I tried them on I had the same problem as other reviewers, even though I purchased the same size, which here is 33, they were too big. I have had the same issue with Levi's before and I don't know if it is because they are made in Sri Lanka or not but it's a big problem. Obviously, this is not Amazon's fault and in fact, Amazon makes things very easy with their return policy. So I set up a return and decided to order a size 32 and another size 33 to hopefully get one that fit properly. I also discovered Amazons try it before you buy it which made things even easier. So when my package arrived, I first tried on the size that should fit me and thankfully, they did so I did not even have to open the plastic bag on the other pair of pants. And setting up this return was just as easy. All I had to do was go on the app and choose what I was keeping and follow the directions for returning the ones I did not want. The size issue is the reason for for 4 stars, but I do recommend these jeans but you may want to order a couple of different sizes under the try it first program and hopefully you will end up with a pair that fits the first time around and returns are very easy. Simply follow the instructions and return The Unwanted merchandise to your nearest UPS store",
