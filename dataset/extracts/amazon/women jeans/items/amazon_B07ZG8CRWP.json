                "reviewText": "These jeans are perfect for those that are smaller in the waist than they are in the hips/glute area. I get tons of compliments, they\u2019re comfy and amazing quality. The length is perfect for my 5\u20192 height; they hit right at my ankle. The only thing I want to warn is that the waistband has NO stretch. I still wear them but as someone who has become accustomed to a stretchy waistband, I was initially put off my how \u201ctight\u201d they felt around my waist. But they do fit and look amazing, just make sure your measurements are accurate and don\u2019t expect much wiggle room in the waist.",

                "reviewText": "Ah, the sweet siren call of a fresh pair of pants. I succumbed to the allure in April 2022, and was thrilled with my purchase. The color was perfect, the fit was fantastic, and the fabric felt like a whisper against my skin. But alas, my euphoria was short-lived.The pants, it seems, were not designed with the thunder-thighed among us in mind. My thighs, robust and sturdy as they are, took one look at these pants and said, \"Challenge accepted.\" And thus began a battle of attrition.The pants put up a valiant fight, but my thighs, they are seasoned warriors. After a 20 months of frequent wear, the friction between my thighs and the pants created a chasm that no seamstress could mend. I now sport a pair of pants with gaping holes, a testament to the power of thigh rub.But let's not be all doom and gloom. These pants definitely held up in terms of quality as compared to the $29 price!",

                "reviewText": "I wear a size 18W in Gloria Vanderbilts and Kohl's store brand. Amazon recommended size 18. But based on the reviews I sized up to 20 and am VERY glad I did.I'm in the process of losing weight. I'm 5'8\" and 230lbs. I have a big round butt, hips and thighs and a smaller waist and usually have that annoying waste gap. No so much with these. I have oddly short legs and so the regular hits the top of my feet. It's not sloppy long. I'm SHOCKED these fit so nice. I don't know why but I am. I had zero expectations of these.I would say the only thing is that there is very little stretch to the waist. They just fit without feeling like they're gonna cut me in two- if they have as much cotton as they say- it should stretch a little over the day and be just right. But I haven't washed them and I'm kinda afraid to. lolHonestly? I looked at so many skinny jeans I didn't discern between the midrise and the high rise waist. I think these will be fine but I'm also going to try the highrise waist. Probably keep both because I'm lost quite a bit of weight now and have zero wardrobe in the pants dept.I like these because they don't seem to smash down the butt and make it look flat. For my first pair of skinny jeans- They are extremely comfortable. I'm actually quite excited about these. The PRICE Is phenomenal! You can't find a pair that cheap- maybe WalMart- but I live in a small town so the selection is always nothing.CHECK Your measurements!",

                "reviewText": "***UPDATE: I have worn these jeans about 1x/week after washing 3 times to start. Even with weekly washings there is still a slight note of that smell left. I only wear them for work since I don't care if my work clothes get dirty. They look nice enough that I would wear for everyday if it weren't for the odor and the fact that they don't hold their shape well after a few hours of wear. They are fairly comfortable, though. Overall, I sold NOT buy again unless they were about 1/2 price, and then only for pants I don't care to get dirty.***If I am ever able to actually put these jeans on I will come back and edit my review to update fit & feel. But, I have washed these THREE times and they still smell very strongly of something akin to dry cleaning chemicals. They made my whole laundry room STINK. I'm afraid to try them on yet because I don't want my skin to react or to cause anything else to stink.As far as look and feel, my Walmart jeans feel sturdier and better made. The material is light weight & thin. Not very denim-y. More like cheaper jegging material. The color isn't as nice as the pictures either, but not a deal breaker. I think they'll be comfortable for work if I can ever get to wear them. I'm giving them a night outside in the fresh air & one more wash before I give up & send them back.",
