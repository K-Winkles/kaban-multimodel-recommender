Weather it\u2019s planting flowers, tending to the lawn or tinkering in the garage, these jeans have seen it. I started with two pairs for work, they are light, flexible, thin, and straight, I don\u2019t like when bootcut actually looks like a flared leg, they fit over my work boots well. They don\u2019t stretch out too much during the day, they don\u2019t squeeze too tight in the band. I\u2019m 5\u20197\u201d and about 180lbs. I have more up top than I do down low, with little/no booty. I ordered 11/12x34 which is a tad larger that I usually buy but these are soooo comfortable. They are on the thinner side, I haven\u2019t had any wear through or blow out yet in the couple of months I\u2019ve been wearing them, (with atleast 2 washes a week) but I think they are reasonable for $28 a pair.Oh and The pockets are a decent size!!! Not tiny! I went back and bought more, i now own 5 pairs.",

I have thicker legs and waist with no butt or hips.... I was so happy these fit me perfect. However after wearing them for about 20 minutes the waist did start to stretch out, but the crotch and butt still held good after wearing all day. So tired of saggy butts. I haven't washed them yet, so I am hoping they will tighten up a little after running through the dryer.Best part of the jeans is that you feel like you're wearing blue jeans and not spanx. Great demin color too! Going to order another pair.",

But love these jeans and having a choice in Wrangler for something different to wear is wonderful. I am getting bootcut bored and want to wear some of my cute sneakers, such as my Blowfish Malibu, and these are absolutely perfect for that. Also perfect for the Ariat ankle boots or even Ariat loafers. Absolute comfort and they hold their shape really well throughout the day. LOVE the price! I am so over paying $100 for Cowgirl Tuff or Kimes, which the Kimes I wont be buying again I've decided, I played that game and I'm just not feeling that high price tag for what looks like Momma jeans. You'll love these.",

This size leaves enough room for a big dinner, therefore not too tight but not too big!! Great quality as expected from wrangler.",
