I would normally be a large but purchased a medium and fit like a glove because of the stretchiness of the jean, showed all the curves. BUT\u2026 I purchased the navy blue and the jeans have the white patchy look on the front and the back of the legs, not a fan. I wanted to be able to use these for work and dress them up. The white patches just takes away from the business casual look and even for regular use, just not my thing. I did return but otherwise would have kept them with if not for the white blotches. These definitely did not match the navy blue picture shown in ALL dark blue. Picture simply was not the same as what arrived",
