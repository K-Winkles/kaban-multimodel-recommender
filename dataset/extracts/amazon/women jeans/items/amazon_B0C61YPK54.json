I like the fact that the styling is different than all of my other jeans. When I ordered them, I was worried about the length being too short, but they are nice and long, just like I prefer. Good for wearing with a slight heel as most athletic shoes have nowadays. I highly recommend them if you like the styling and are looking for a jean with a wider leg and longer than ankle length.",
