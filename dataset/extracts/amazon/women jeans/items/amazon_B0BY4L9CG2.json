Fit was amazing, I didn\u2019t have any problems with the button staying buttoned as others have mentioned, my stomach is fairly flat so maybe that has something to do with it\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0fI went ahead and ordered the khaki color, this time I ordered a six regular inseam instead of the short bc even though I measured the 6 short was a tad shorter than described, I will keep them despite the fact that I\u2019d be more comfortable with them a little longer bc they fit every where else, the material, stretch, and color, waist everything else perfect! I will wear them with flats.But the khaki color with the medium inseam seemed like a whole different style! The length was actually perfect but the material was very thin, the buttonholes had frays so I couldn\u2019t get them unbuttoned! Also the fit in the hips and waist was much larger than the short and the only thing that was supposed to be different was the length.I sent them back hoping I just got a bad pair and reordered the same.Hoping the replacement is good because I really like these jeans!",

The colour was not true to the photo - for example the khaki looks more yellow in the photo - and the markings were either missing or placed oddly. My major concern is around the shape as the top of the legs is very baggy, not tight as it appears on the model in the photo. Real pity as this limits my options; I would have liked to have had the chance to wear them to more external functions but the odd fit means I will probably just wear them walking the dog or around the house. The material is fine. I wanted summer weight so was happy with the fabric choice.",
