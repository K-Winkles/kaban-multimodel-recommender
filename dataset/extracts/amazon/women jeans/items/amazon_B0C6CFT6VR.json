                "reviewText": "Very nice pair of jeans for curvier tall folks. finally a pair that covers my ankles!I do use all the pockets, though if I don't take the time to pull my pants down by the fabric at my calves, it will dump everything in the right slanted and left butt pocket on the floor. It is at just the right place where the fabric bunches that it ejects it all. I've tried using items with clips and smaller items in the slanted pocket, but even while walking everything jumbles around out of place or is pushed off of its secured lip of fabric.Other than that, awesome pair of pants. good butt and foopa space for the bigger sizes while also not being too baggy on the hips/waist. I have walked in these about 50 miles already and while they do have a tiny bit of lint pilling on the inner thighs, I can tell the fabric is hearty enough to last a long while without holes rubbing into them. You can stretch and squat and bend however you'd like and they stay up. Breathe well, launder nice. 8/10 Just make sure you don't launch all your pocket things all over the bathroom floor if you use all the pockets as I do. Or if you do on accident, carry disinfectant wipes for the aftermath. :/",
