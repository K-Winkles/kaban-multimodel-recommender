                "reviewText": "OK, in my lifetime (I'm a young 63) I had given up hope of ever finding a pair of Levis that would fit me. I had one pair and they were boyfriend, 501's, but they were very loose, broken in and distressed and hit me low on the hip. I LOVED them. I gained weight in the last couple of years and I can't wear them as I did. Because I'm curvy and short (5'4\", 23\" waist, 43\" hip at the widest, weight...somewhere around 150) my shape wasn't good for the seemingly straight 501's. So 501's were never in my future and I just gave up, especially when all jean brands were adding so much stretch that they may have been leggings. My all-time favorites were Gap 1969 but they also went off the deep end.I admit, I fell for a \"news\" article about a celebrity wearing these Levis but mostly the cost caught my eye. They were $44.99 at the time. Not even knowing where to start, I ordered 3 pairs, 30\", 31\" and 32\".The first pair to arrive were the 31's. They went on just fine which can mean an uh-oh. I wore them around the house to see how they'd stretch. Unfortunately they stretched in a bad way. I absolutely hate when the rise is too long and petite sizing is best for me. A long rise can make a great fitting jean so bad if the crotch hang's down. What I loved about this jean was they hit at a great point around my hip bones but they did gap pretty badly at the waist. These are not low. Mid, I'd say. The length was too long for me as well. They went back.I got the 32\" next. OK, these were nearly exactly like the boyfriend jeans I loved. They sunk low on the hip and were slouchy but in a good way. Because they were big all over, the crotch thing didn't bother me. As the day went on they stretched out a bit more. I can safely say that as time goes on, they will get so much softer and with a washing they go back to the original wear. I cut the hem off and want them to fray. I can also roll them up if I want to. I did not expect to find a replica of my boyfriend jeans...a happy surprise! Definitely keepers.I was a little worried about the 30\". So much so that I almost cancelled the order. I'm so glad I didn't! Other than being too long, they seem to be a perfect fit. I wore them today and they stretched out to fit so well in the waist, hip and thigh. No gap at the back when I sit and the crotch stayed where it should. I did cut the hem as well. I was impatient. I didn't want to wait to get them hemmed. I'll see how they wash and decide.The denim is a good, quality thickness but not too much to make them stiff and hard to walk. I love that there is no stretch. I can't say how happy I am to have found them and now I have 2 looks for them. Of course, the price was awesome!",

                "reviewText": "I have somewhat narrow hips, a belly/mom pooch, thick thighs, a butt, and short legs. Finding flattering jeans is a nightmare. I pulled these on and OMG. They slid on perfectly, the zip was so satisfying, perfect fit. I feel hugged and supported, instead of squished and constricted. They are so flattering Nd since I have a short torso, the mid rise falls perfectly.They are long, but so is every other pair of pants, I\u2019m used to it.Ill crop them to a good length. I like that the straight cut seems to lengthen my legs compared to skinny jeans. I will say I tried on a couple washes in this style at Tilly\u2019s and they do all seem to fit slightly different. The cotton will wear in though. I would recommend finding a retailer that carries them to try on before ordering. For $35, these are a steal. Would purchase again 10000%",

                "reviewText": "First of all, these are 100% cotton, so if you're looking for a jean with stretch that adjusts to your curves, these are not ever going to be the jeans for you. And yes, they're going to be a little stiff at first, but if you want a pair of jeans that are going to stick around for a while, that's a good thing. They'll get softer over time without getting stretched out and puckering all weird. These are long term relationship jeans, not fast fashion only good for a hookup jeans.And 100% cotton also means you're looking for them to be a little snug after a wash (or when tried on initially), because they'll loosen up through out the day. (Also, unless necessary, you shouldn't be washing your 100% cotton jeans after each wear anyways.) These are all staples and PROS of 100% cotton jeans. If you don't want any of that, there's more than enough options out there with less cotton.With that out of the way!These are my go to jeans. I'm 5'6\" and a fit 140, with slightly wider hips and thick thighs. I hate feeling jeans plastered to my thighs, and these are perfect for that without giving me so much fabric around my legs I feel like I've got entire skirts wrapped around each one. They're also NOT low rise (thankfully), with most of them fitting me at a comfortable mid-rise.I think where you land size wise depends on your body shape (and also the finish on the jean). These are probably best suited, with no alterations, for those with less curves / a narrower hip, like all the models in the pictures. I needed to go up a size in a few of the finishes to accommodate my hips, but it doesn't cause issues in the the waist until I sit down and I get a little gap at the back. (Easily and cheaply fixable with a quick trip to a tailor. Though there's also super easy tutorials online for fixing this yourself.)And as mentioned, there is a little variation in size depending on the color. I've tried 4 different colorways at this point, and have either been a 28 or 29. The light gray actually fits me the most snug and more high waisted, so I'm good at a 29 with that one. But the 29 in the breathe out version is a tad too large around the waist for me without alterations. That said it's not overly large to the point of falling down or looking weird, I just would have been better off with a 28. (Again, not entirely unexpected with a natural fiber that can change a bit depending on the dye.)The length is perfect, hitting right at the top of my foot and not dragging on the ground. And while a little heavier/thicker feeling than cotton/poly/etc blends, it's more of a midweight cotton, so not too heavy and not too thin. I probably won't wear them out in the dead of a Southern summer, but I wouldn't be wearing any jeans out in that. They'll do more than fine all spring, fall and winter. (Since there's extra room it's easy to put some fleece lined tights under them without looking like you instantly gained 10 pounds on your bottom half.)So, for me, they're perfect. Just have to understand what you're getting.",
