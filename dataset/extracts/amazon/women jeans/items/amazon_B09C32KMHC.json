                "reviewText": "Y'all, I got this pair of jeans to wear tucked into my boots for the winter. When they came in the cuff was tacked in place and I wanted them to extend further into my boots so I clipped the tacking and rolled them down. They come just to my ankle and I can still roll up in the spring. The stretch is great, not too little or too much, and the waistband is wide and so comfortable. I ordered a Medium and generally wear a 7 or 8 so I believe they fit as expected. I have 2 pair of boot cut Wallflowers and love all three. They can expect more business from me coz I'm from Oklahoma and we're pretty picky about out jeans.",

They do have quit a bit of stretch which makes them comfortable, but they loose their fit and become too big quickly. So for me I have to wash and dry them after every use and a find myself having to pull them up all the time by the end of the day. But still a cute comfy pair of jeans and I may consider other colors.",

                "reviewText": "The curvy fit is definitely more forgiving and molds your curves. The 2 button mid-rise waist is perfect for smoothing out & holding in my muffin top. I am long-waisted so it may not do the same for short-waisted women. The size 3 was a perfect fit and equal to my 26 waist Buckle jeans. Not the same quality as higher priced cropped jeans but a great daily jean for everyday errands in summer! I did order 4 pairs of these in various shades, the price is good to start with and even more awesome with the added coupons on certain colors. Definitely worth looking thru all of the options to find the discounted ones!My one complaint is the same I have had when ordering Wallflower jeans - they stink! Even after you wash them there is a weird chemical odor. I randomly keep thinking, what is that smell, when wearing them! Hopefully it will dissipate the after multiple washes.",
