I liked these jeans so much, I bought 4 pairs. And I never spend more than $30 on a pair of jeans. So buying 4 pairs really gives you an idea of how much I like them. The straight leg is perfect. Not too loose at the ankle. I like the 98% cotton blend better than the blend with polyester. These are such a flattering alternative to skinny jeans. Thanks Democracy!",
