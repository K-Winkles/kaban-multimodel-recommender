These jeans will last many years and I feel with the softness and quality of the denim they will only get better with age. There is a nice soft cotton fabric sewn on the inside of the waistline with a pretty paisley pattern. The button in the front is a fancier button with a cute design on it. The stitching over all is nice and the design on the back pockets and the position of them are flattering. They fit nicely on the hips too. They are slightly long on me but I have short legs, but with a not too high boot or heel they will be the perfect length. Overall I am very satisfied with the product. The price was a little high but I am a firm believer you get what you pay for and I am willing to pay the price for a good quality product. Same with sneakers or bras . . . . some things you just shouldn't skimp on.",

                "reviewText": "These are a high cotton content, low stretch true denim jeans. I like jeans without any stretch; these have some but not too much. The mid rise sits low enough that my belt sits in that sweet spot just below my actual hip bone. They give me muffin top but all my jeans do that and it doesn\u2019t bother me. They are long enough to make a nice pile on top of my shoes, which I like. There are darts next to the back pockets that allow them to hug the butt nicely. Roomy front pockets big enough for my hands with back pockets big enough for my Otterboxed iPhone. I am 5\u20195\u201d and 127-129lbs depending on the day and I ordered size 27R in Ocean color. I debated getting size 28R but am glad I went with the smaller size so they wouldn\u2019t be baggy.***Update: washed and worn = my new favorite pair of jeans. Washed in cold water, dried on ultra low. They fit a tiny bit snugger after washing now but not much, certainly not enough to order a size up. The fit on these jeans is unbelievable. They are perfect butt huggers. I wear my jeans for 3 days between washes and I\u2019m on day 2 right now. They don\u2019t loosen up as the day goes on and they don\u2019t wind up being too baggy after wearing them for 2 days. No saggy crotch here, no hiking them up; just perfect.Oh, and something I didn\u2019t notice before but is a wonderful feature on the jeans is the extra right and left belt loop in the back. 7 belt loops to support the length of your belt will keep your belt from ever coming over the top band on your jeans when you bend over or squat down. These jeans pair perfectly with my 10 year old Ariat Fatbaby Center Stitch belt. Highly recommended!",

I got the size 29 waist, extra long, mid-rise, boot-cut Ariat Jeans, I think, the whipstitch, not sure. With vans shoes, they drag on the ground, and I roll them up to not ruin the bottom of the legs. In my workman's square-toed country boots, they barely don't drag on the floor. The extra long is perfect for my height. Why should short girls be the only ones who get to have jeans that touch the floor? They seem like they're 37\" inseams. Also, I usually get Alloy Apparel jeans (because they cater to tall girls), but I took a chance and got these Ariats for the first time. I didn't even know Ariats sold extra long jeans. They far exceed in quality. The jean material is nice and sturdy. Reminds me of the days back in the 80's & 90's when jeans were thicker, and didn't feel so thin and stretchy. These Ariat jeans do have a little stretch, but it's not ridiculous. It's the perfect percentage of stretch. The mid-rise are not as high as I thought they would be, considering all I've bought for the last decade is low-rise. I now love mid-rise. It's not mom-pants high-waist, but not so low you show crack every time you bend over a little. I never need a belt to keep the jeans from sliding down too low when I bend over. It's really very flattering on the female figure. These jeans are extremely flattering. Best looking jeans I've ever had. I bought three pairs of new jeans recently, now that I'm getting back to my pre-baby size: Alloy, Ariat, and Maurice's. All boot-cut. Ariat's win. They are the best quality, best cut, best material, best design. They are the best. Now I want to buy more Ariats, because I find myself wearing the Ariats over and over, and only putting on the other guys when I don't have time to wash the Ariats.",

It seems to me the two pairs should have fit me the same except for the length. In any event, I really like the cut, style, color and quality, and I hope to be able to figure out the sizes.
