I wanted real jeans not those jegings too and these are them! I love these jeans! Finally jeans that are comfortable that fit and are flattering. They have a nice stretch in the waist band as well it\u2019s not your normal band. It\u2019s really nice.I am 5\u20194 and 270lbs for reference.",

Those fit beautifully! And willbuy lots more of that style. I can't do skinny leg - I\"m getting to old to fight with my clothing. Stick with thestraight leg if you have problems with the skinny leg.",
