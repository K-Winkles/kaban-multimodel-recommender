They actually fit perfectly and I wish I could have kept them; however, there is some weird defect either in sewing or perhaps in how the fabric was cut which results in puffy areas on both the inside and outside of the top of the jean legs. Looks very strange to have these little puffy areas poking out. I don't usually buy jeans on line but decided to take a chance. I guess it's back to a store to try on the jeans before purchasing.",

Needless to say jeans were extremely difficult to find for my body. These though are beyond perfect. They\u2019re extremely easy to wear and so comfortable!! The stretch is very comfortable and the wash (main thrill) is really pretty!! These jeans make my figure look phenomenal and sexy!! I ordered a size (8) mainly because I didn\u2019t know what my actual size was because of gaining weight. These will stretch a bit more over time. I probably could have done a size (6) given the amount of stretch these have but I\u2019m just glad they fit well with a little give happening over time. The hem (27 1/2- Petite) is really great!! I\u2019d prefer a bit shorter like a 25-26 only because I can\u2019t wear flat shoes with these unless I want to walk on them a bit. Otherwise the hem is perfect for heeled shoes!! I\u2019m not drowning in excess fabric which I appreciate!! Get these you won\u2019t be disappointed!!",
