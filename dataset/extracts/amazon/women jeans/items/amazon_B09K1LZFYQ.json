But the jeans were really tight; I kept them but major muffin top and uncomfortable. So this time I went up two sizes to 16, which the size chart says \"waist 37.8 - 38.8\" which is way too big for me, but when I got the jeans, the inside label says \"waist 33\" and they fit me perfectly. So take this into account when ordering. These are comfy and flattering, I love them.",

                "reviewText": "I have long legs for my height and a generous backside, which means that finding pants that fit my legs and waist properly was a challenge. I joke that from the waist down I should be 6\u2019 2\". From the waist up I should be 4' 10\". I ended up being 5\" 8.5\". My pants usually fit either the waist or the length, but not both. I gave up on having the waist fit and just resigned myself to belts and bunched up fabric at the waist.Until now. These jeans were flattering and long enough right out of the Amazon box. The boot cut was very attractive. It looked straight. I am still gobsmacked at how good they looked on me. I even picked up another size in a different wash, just-in-case. I was able to return the other pair unopened.They are not perfect, though. They are thinner than 501 jeans and I don't love the stitching on the back pocket. Fortunately, I'm not chasing little kids anymore and I live in a very warm environment. I doubt they will wear out for me. But it's a noticeable reduction in fabric quality.I still cannot believe how well they fit me. I am seriously considering ordering them in another wash in my size. Yay!",

Found these and I like them. They are slightly stretchy and with a belt they stay put. Very comfortable. For me they are a bit long but I am a chunky petite so sometimes my size is not available and I make due. So with a belt and shoes they are fine. Take the shoes off and they drag a bit on the floor but at home that is fine.",
