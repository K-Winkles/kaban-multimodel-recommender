                "reviewText": "I'm glad I looked at the picture and took the advice of other reviews and sized up. I usually can wear a 10 but I got the 12 and very glad I did. They fit like my other 10's. The regular is quite long for those of you tall girls and I will be hemming 2 inches off these. I could have probably worn the short but it wasn't available. The rise is good and fits my natural waist. There's a lot of stretch and the knees don't bag out. The legs are tapered but more like a straight leg and not tight. I'm tempted to buy another pair. It's a very good deal on Amazon. ANOTHER PURCHASE: I did get another pair of these in the same color but size 12 short. I measured the inseam of the 12 short, which fit perfectly including the length and it was 30 1/2, which is what a regular measures in length. So I think the sizing is off on these jeans. They run small and long, so size up but consider sizing down on the length. I still love them. They are comfortable and the fabric is substantial and looks and feels like regular denim.",

                "reviewText": "I love these jeans because they are slim in the leg and ankle, but wide at the waist so that they don\u2019t dig into my abdomen. They fit perfectly. I am not a fan of the wide waist band, but so happy to be comfortable that I don\u2019t care much. The description says they are high rise, but on me they are medium rise. That is probably because I have a long torso and short legs. My disappointment is not with this Shoshone color but with the Kansas color that go in the same size (8 short). It is about an inch longer and an inch or more wider in the leg and ankle opening. Still quite comfortable, but not as nice a fit. I am keeping them because it is so hard for me to find jeans that are comfortable in the abdomen and not huge everywhere else. The Kansas is not as flattering, but not terrible. I also got a third pair, the Vermont, and it fits more like the first one, but it is an inch longer. So three pairs and each fits a little differently.",

The waist stretch band is very comfortable; the length is about an inch too long but not worth hemming up. And the price doesn't break the bank! I highly recommend this product.",

Unfortunately I did not walk around in them, sit, or do other activities, or I would have known they don\u2019t stay up. I am constantly hitching them up, and what an irritation! The waist needs to be smaller. Other than that I am pleased with them, but sure wish I had worn them longer before buying.",
