But I have a pretty short torso (inseam is usually 33\u201d) & barely a waistline (and butt)\ud83d\ude43 the waistband hits just below my belly button & I LOVE THAT! If you have a long torso, you might find the rise more on the low rise side. But they are perfect on me! The length is great for flats for my longer legs & the leg of the jean is like a gradual boot! Some boot cut jeans feel more like flare jeans cause they are tighter down the thigh and down the knee and flare out starting below the knee, but these gradually start to flare (the knees aren\u2019t tighter like the upper thigh) and are really comfortable & flattering for my body type! A little stretch which is good enough to feel comfortable but not enough for baggy butt after sitting!Only drawback might be the button closure? If I was about to pee my pants and dancing in front of the toilet, I\u2019d probably end up peeing my pants or breaking the button\u2026 it\u2019s a bit on the tight side? But also seems delicate so I felt I had to be careful and it took a bit to get unbuttoned (maybe a few seconds realistically, but I'm a habitual holder so that few seconds can go the wrong way!)",
