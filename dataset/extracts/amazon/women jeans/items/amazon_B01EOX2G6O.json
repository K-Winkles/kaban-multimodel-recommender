                "reviewText": "The \"Lee Tall Instantly Slims Classic Relaxed Fit Monroe Straight Leg Jeans\" are my absolute favorite jeans. They are the best fitting and best looking jeans I own. In fact, this is my 3rd purchase of them. I now own 5 of the 6 colors offered. This time, I bought them in the color Ellis. These jeans are made for tall / leggy women who need long length jeans. The 11.5\" front rise of the jean allow them to sit comfortably about mid way between the waist and belly button. These top quality stretch denim, fashionable, straight leg, button fly jeans have a 34\" inseam and a built in tummy panel that instantly and continuously slims to provide a flattering and shapely fit around my waist, hips and buttocks helping me to look my best.*** Inseam Problem SolvedThe folks at Lee helped us tall / long legged women by making jeans with the longer inseams we need in order for them to fit us correctly. This entire line of Tall sized jeans have a 34 inch inseam. For someone like me who is very leggy and is 5' 9\", I know these jeans will look and fit me good. Additionally, since proper inseam length is no longer an issue for me, when I wear these jeans, I can also wear practically any of my shoe styles and heel heights with them: from my flats, sneakers and sandals to my fashionable high high heel pumps, platforms and open toe designs, in these jeans, I can wear them all. Thanks Lee!*** Fashionable DenimIn my opinion, the Relaxed Fit and Classic Straight Leg styling of the Monroe jean is the fresh, contemporary, fashionable denim look I want to wear, coordinate and accessorize for. The high quality fabrics used in the stretch denim help slim my figure and fit me better than the other brands / styles I've tried in the past. That's the reason I keep coming back to Lee and why I bought these jeans in five colors.*** Quality & ComfortThe blend of the cotton, polyester and spandex of 81%, 18% and1% respectively was done to create the high quality fabric needed in the jeans and helps the slimming, shaping and contouring of the waist, hips and buttocks. This blending ratio also gives the jeans their softness, the ideal amount of stretchiness that is needed to enhance the shapely silhouette look we like and, ensures the all day comfort and wear ability we expect. NOTE: The jean material's blend and the ratios just mentioned apply to all the colors offered EXCEPT the color Palisade as its material blend listed as 98% Cotton and 2% Spandex . Therefore, since I do not own and haven't worn that color in these jeans, I cannot be certain of how the Palisade colored / named jeans perform.",

                "reviewText": "These are loose fitting jeans, especially though the thigh (not what I intended to order). To me, Classic Fit is what I have worn for years--not skinny, not baggy (\"classic\"). When I first tried these on I wondered if I should return them for a smaller size; but, although the waist was loose, they fit fairly snugly through the seat and so I kept them. However, after wearing them a couple of times (before they were washed) they stretched a bit through the hips, so now they are kind of baggy. I'm 72 and do try to dress for my age, but these are still looser through the leg than I would like.Update: I have now washed these jeans two times and the waist is no longer loose--it's quite comfortable in fact, but I would still only give them 3 stars; the stride is a little longer than I would like -- they just don't fit my body type. When I ordered I was paying more attention to the length of the inseam because I have such a hard time finding jeans long enough. I was thrilled to find jeans with a 34\" inseam and I didn't really look at the picture, but the picture is fairly accurate--the legs are pretty straight all the way down from the hips.",
