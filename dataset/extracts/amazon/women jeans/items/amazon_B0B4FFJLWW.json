                "reviewText": "Nice high rise fit for those moms like me that need a little extra support. Super comfortable even with out them being stretchy. There is some stretch to them but I would not consider them stretchy jeans. Great quality too! I went with my normal size, I didn\u2019t size up because of the lack of stretch and they are perfect. I feel like if I did size up they would be too big after wearing them for an hour or so.",

                "reviewText": "As a gal who has been wearing Gap jeans for the better part of a decade, the sizing lately has been pretty inconsistent. I normally wear a 27 or 28 in waist depending on stretch within the denim. Based on reviews, I sized up to a 29 - and they were tight. I am going to exchange for the next size up because they are very cute but that being said - it's ridiculous. I am not a 30. I just ordered Gap jeans in a 27 in April that fit. I have tried on a few pairs in recent months were sizes have greatly fluctuated. May be time to check out new brands that I can rely on a little more.For reference, I am 5'6 and weigh 145 lbs.",

Two stars for the fabric quality.",
