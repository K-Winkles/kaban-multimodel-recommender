Even the ones from specialty stores that cost nearly $100 which on a fixed income I can no longer afford.I did the try then buy option that Amazon offers and I figured the worst that could happen would be to return all of them. I ordered a pair from a well-known brand a two pair of these Lee brand. I put the well-known brand on first and although they fit okay around waist and hip they were at least 6 inches too long. I am able to sew so I thought, okay I can make these work. I\u2019m 5\u20197\u201d.Next I tried on these Lee jeans and oh my goodness. They fit perfectly: length, soft, and very comfortable. That was the blue pair and I thought there\u2019s no way the black pair is going to fit as comfortably as the blue. Well, what a pleasant surprise. The black were just as soft and comfy as the blue ones. I decided to send back the pair I would have to shorten (plus they were more expensive!).Since I was down to zero long-leg jeans (I much prefer wearing knee-length), I ordered two more pair of the blue color and they too fit perfectly. I hope these jeans work out well for you too. Good luck finding the perfect fit for you.",

                "reviewText": "These jeans are very soft and stretchy even though they are a heavier denim blend. The cut is ok. They just look like average jeans, not the most flattering but they do make my booty look nice. I can move very easily in these jeans, I think I'm a 16 now that I've gained weight but I ordered an 18 because I liked the look on model but wanted baggier for a relaxed cute weekend look and to be gentle on my stomach. I should've got the 16, the cut is just not the same that model is wearing so the bigger size, although it fits, is frumpy. These jeans also do not have the worn appearance through the pelvic and upper thigh area. They are one solid color, which takes away from the \"look\" that appears on the model. They are a good deal for the price but do not expect the same jean as shown. I also have small calves and ankles and these are too straight leg for my taste. I hold my weight in my hips and thighs and these are roomy enough that I can move very comfortably. I will be keeping them, although they'll probably end up being worn to do chores around the house.",
