They have great \"give\" around the waist while at the same time hug your curves - very figure flattering. I love the new \"boot cut\" style. It's a little reminiscent of \"bell bottoms\" but not nearly as wide. These pants can be dressed up or worn casually. The black color is a solid, very black hue and has not faded. I wash inside out in cold water and hang dry.",

I'm so happy with the fit and comfort. I ordered size 8P and they are a dream! The waist has a stretchy band inside it that keeps it in place and keeps it from binding or rolling over. The thighs fit smoothly and there's no bagginess at the knees. The material is very soft and comfortable. I am 100% over the moon completely pleased with these jeans, and I have never said that about jeans before!",
