No muffin top, and no nipple huggers.**Straight leg is an awesome width.Love that I could find a straight leg that doesn\u2019t flair too much, or drag.**waist =31\u201d**Regular length = 32\u201d** GREAT FIT**I\u2019m a size 12 weight 167 lbs. 5\u20196\u201dI am a med bone size, so that is where some of my weight is. I have narrow hips, and a big butt. (which I hate, but that\u2019s genetic. Why in the WORLD would anyone want a large Ass is crazy! But whatever.)**GREAT FABRIC/MATERIAL**Soft but still jeans, and not too tight, loose enough to still wear while hangin\u2019 at home. Usually when I get home, the first thing I take off are my jeans. All my jeans are too, stretchy. Stretchy is great, until they fall down a few inches, after a few hours, like tights do, and I end up having to wear a tight belt. And my regular cotton jeans have no stretch, are a hard & stiff fabric. They fit great until I sit down once, or twice, because reg, non stretch \u201chard/stuff fabric\u201d , actually just stretch out, and never stretch back.**StretchBut with these Signature jeans the fabric has the perfect amount of stretch, a bit stretchy, and a bit reg jean. Just enough to wear 2x before a wash.Hope you try them. Happy jean hunting.",

                "reviewText": "These jeans are a great fit for me. They didn't have a smaller size for me for the pair being sold along with these by same company, so I thought I'd give these a try. Very slimming. They're a tad long for me, but they work out good anyways. I about 5'5 165lbs. If you're looking for a bit of stretch and very forgiving in the stretch department if needed, these will do that for you. I've worn them once, and both my daughter and husband said they look very nice on me.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased 2 pair Cape Town, and 2 of the Angel Island colors.I wanted jeans highly/mostly more cotton than stretch. Minimal meaning all cotton and single digits stretch/anything else.And a label at the belt with your make-name \"in lights\" as-if you plan to be in business next year still and make your jeans quality enough that you plan to still be building your client base. Any jeans (yah you know who you are...) that are sold with no label, are posers. Yah ya got me over the years. Just move on along poser jeans...I am so very happy,finally,to have foundreal Levi's,Real Signature labels on the back,that fit like real Levi's,and***almost*** 100% cotton.They wear like expected.Fit like expected.They aren't so tight at the ankles my feet swell lol,I got short - perfect PERFECT length, and no change in length after washing and fully-drying!Waist falls just-right - my soft middle is not \"highlighted\" nor stuffed so tight I cannot breath.Only barely stretch - cannot tell they are only small amount stretch - and they are roughly the same shape/size when I put them on and later when I take them off.Comfy, fabric feels like 100% cotton jeans (but you know they are just barely stretch).Will fade very slowly like expected of *real jeans*.I will forever miss my 100% cotton Calvins. My love for a decades-long part of my life.But I am so happy for having (finally) found this seller (=this exact seller name only), selling exactly these jeans. These \"the real thing\" Levi's. Sometimes these reviews get somehow switched over onto different ads, or different items (of different quality) are shown that same review... This review is only for this Amazon seller name and colors Cape Town and Angel Island.Feel my glee as, once I physically had four pairs in hand here and post first-wash/fully dry and retry, I rolled up and donated forward X pairs of poser jeans.Until your closet is good with jeans, you ain't good at all.5 flippin flashing sparkly stars for this seller selling these jeans. I chose Plus (I did not want jeanins, leggins, jeggins, or Danskin-Tights-Jeans !! ) > Size 18 > Short 29\".Wishing all well!",

                "reviewText": "These pants fit large in the waist but very narrow in the knees? I don't understand it but the whole day, even with a belt, they ride down at the knees. Wtf? I'm short so the pants have plenty of length. My belt keeps them in place at my waist but I can actually feel the pants creeping down my legs. With the size of my hips I'm used to pants riding down but these aren't crawling in the normal spot. It's literally the smallest part of my thigh that they crawl from so it makes no sense to me. I'll wear them but I can say honestly, I won't buy these again.The pockets are nice and deep. I can fit my cellphone in my back pocket, no trouble. You can fit a tampon in a front pocket lying down sideways. The belt loops are properly attached. The color is deep (a little too dark IMHO) but it isn't that weird color between navy and black that never looks right. If they could solve the knee issue, I'd give them another go but as they currently exist, nah, I'll pass.",
