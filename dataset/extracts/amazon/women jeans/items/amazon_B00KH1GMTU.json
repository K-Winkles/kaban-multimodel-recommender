These jeans have enough stretch to be comfortable but not so much that you end up hiking up your jeans all day. They also have the perfect length, rise and fit at the waist. These are your next favorite pair of jeans!",

                "reviewText": "I'm always hesitant to give 5-stars. In this case, the 4 stars are really more about my taste and my body - has nothing to do with the way these jeans are made. Looking at them and wearing them they feel well made and sturdy. I've never had a problem with Silver Jeans. In my experience they deliver what they advertise. I would say these jeans are super comfortable, don't pinch or cut in on you.I've put on some weight these past few years so I ordered a 12 based on the size charts. Could of probably gone with a 10. I am 5'4 - not sure how much I weigh but I stopped fitting into my sz 6 jeans about 2 years ago and then 8's are now too tight. I thought the 12 would work until I can drop the fats I'm lugging around.The jean is advertised as a Mid-Rise which is good for me because I am short waisted. Usually, Mid-rise jeans fit comfortably just below my belly button - MAYBE it's because the size 12 I ordered is a bit too large and loose on me but the waist is more of a \"high waist\" from the 80's :/ It really sits too high for my liking but I am only slightly disappointed in the fit, so hence the 4-Stars.Because they are a a size too large (and I'm too lazy to return them, hmmm might explain the fats, no?) I will just wear a belt - pay attention to the size charts and remember these jeans have a substantial amount of stretch to them.",

Being that I am very straight and narrow through the hips, but highwiasted, and small but Not petite, these were a gem! FInally found some jeans that fit and they feel good too. They look fabulous with boots or heels. They seem to hold up during the wash and still feel good. I have since ordered 2 more pairs of these in different colors. I am 5'4 and 107lbs., highwaisted and very straight, not curvy. I ordered the 24x31 and they are perfect. the length goes just a tad below my ankle, so i odered the 24x33 next time and they go a little bit more so i can wear with boots and heels better. not too long. To me, these are well made, and worth the money! thank you",

                "reviewText": "Hard to come by such well fitting, flattering and comfortable jeans. I stocked up.I've had these jeans for a few months now and I live in them. I have six pair and want to get more because I never want to run out. I'd been looking for the perfect jean for years and, with so many out there, you'd think it wouldn't be so hard. It was! I had found a jean I liked, although not nearly as much as this one, and when I'd worn holes in them and went back to buy more that style no longer existed. What I like about my Silverr Jeans: the fit is perfect on me. Perfect length with legs that are not too tight or too flared. Perfect rise, not too high or too low. Perfect fit through the waist, hips and butt. Perfect comfort, no binding, not too tight or too loose anywhere. Perfect color (don't like dark). Perfect amount of stretch, they hold their shape well and don't tend to start looking baggy in the butt as I wear them. Perfectly flattering on my body. Perfect pocket placement, not too low. No bling (not for me). I couldn't be happier with these jeans. I usually hesitate to buy pants on line but in the picture they looked like they'd be perfect and I was desperate so I took a chance. When I received my first batch and held them up they looked just right. And when I put them on I discovered that I'd found the jean I'd wear in heaven. Delicious look, fit and feel! I hope they never stop making these. But, just in case, I'll continue to build my backup supply. They get more use than any other possession.",
