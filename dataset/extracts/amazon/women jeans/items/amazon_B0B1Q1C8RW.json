It said I should order a large so I did and then I return them for a medium and they fit perfect. They are a bit long but nothing that can't be handled with a heel... they are very stretchy, but they don't look like leggings. They look like a great pair of distressed jeans! I like most women struggle to find a good pair of jeans, and I can't imagine mini body types of these would not work for the materials. Great, they wash and dry great and I definitely recommend again if you want a baggy or fit, the large would be OK but the medium surprisingly fit me and I like the thinner fit :-) get them ladies!!!",

I knocked off one star because the sizes are not accurate. I order the black in medium, and it fit loose. I kept it anyway. Then I ordered a small in denim & beige The beige fit perfect but shrunk in the wash and tight after being washed. There is enough stretch so it's still is okay to wear. the denim was too loose so I figured I would wash it and it would shrink like the beige. It didn't! So they're great jeans however there's no guarantee what size you will actually get!",

                "reviewText": "# I have to change my mind and loved them loved so bummed and for some reason it said after I returned so pairs that they sent me a petite small because for me at 5:00 I didn't realize I had well I had realized but I got a little booty in a belly so yeah definitely was cute in the front in the back but mediums were within 5 minutes just stretched out and again I never found out and I don't know if I imagined it why couldn't we wash them but I wrote to them and wanted to do even exchanges immediately and they're actually was no I guess small petite so I was super bummed out cuz I like pulled them on and it was like yes and not only the dark ones were still too big but what is with that Penny color button yes it's different but as a penny when you wash them and wear them the patina changes and you know it's just too shiny too brand new it looked a little cheap and the jeans were nice they're felt stretchy I mean yes they're not $300 pair of jeans but who cares and I like to have a pair that I can wear with heels and pair I can wear with flip-flops so I bought several pairs so when I received a pair that said it was petite I was fully stoked and I could have done something with the buttons and plenty of mixed media glasses with art I don't know little surfax little something something in my art box but they weren't small somehow I never received a pair of small and now I can't seem to get a response on an just an even exchange for a small and they're more now than what I paid for them I something they did take care of one of them and I appreciate it I love love this brand had a hard time with the I don't know what###Don't have my glasses sorry I wanted to revise love them love them except a little crazy buttons but really downsize they needed to have extra small I don't know the material very well I didn't look I don't understand why we can't wash them then maybe throw them in the dryer didn't check no one has answered that question but I am 56 have been able to wear More Boots and wedge I don't know what you call them tennis shoes you know the ones with the lifts that you can kind of I don't know a long gate your legs to make them look a little thinner but makes your stomach look flat you feeling a little thick in the back and that's just not your style where a little jacket or a cardigan longer cardigan whatever pitch in the right spot and just make sure and I don't know some chunkier like thicker platform boots didn't have a problem with didn't have any problem with my Frye boots I can Google them because f r y e all different kinds and I also have like an ones that aren't fry but have not been able to wear regular Vans and or flip flops cuz they're too long thought I got a pair of petites but the company was like nope not only did you not get small those are not potatoes so yeah that could be helpful also love the company wish they still had more inventory and I'm hoping that I can do it in the evening exchange for the one medium that I have for a small but they don't want to have to return it I and these walls that they have left except for I think that black you black pants I have to double check but any of the small except for the I don't think they have the dark dark blue with the penny but yeah and the pink I'm not real sure if that's because Valentine's Day but whatever be more than happy to exchange that's how much I like them or tell me I can throw them in the washer and dryer and shrink it I don't understand and then I can steam it I don't know love the brand love the brand buy them down's eyes definitely if you're feeling like all these weird mom jeans or the real low ones are all these ones that are out now straight leg with a great stretch and they won't roll and you can wear so many different tops and your belly looks fat they really are a good Jane just downsize \ud83e\udef6\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc8b\ud83d\udcafThe are great because I don't really have hips which is hard because everybody has booties and all that stuff and the whole skinny leg is out the high waist is up they have the perfect flare and they're not that whole super shredded look just enough so you can dress him up or dress them down and you can gain a little weight lose a little weight and no I don't know cuz they the buttons in a little bit of stretch they're fabulous I made a mistake of going to a medium because I put on a few lbs but they were right a small I'm almost 5 6 and I try not to weigh myself but yeah I mean don't even have to get them hemmed which is crazy so like I said try them on throw on some Vans throw some flip flops it's still warm and San Diego except for at night and put on a cute sweater I'm trying to figure out if I can do an exchange cuz I got all mediums and I'm loving them like I said you but it is stretchy you can have a booty You can have hips Don't get me wrong it just doesn't look like I don't know like the skinny jean was good for me because of the thick thighs and the legs in the height and it ended right at the ankle I mean what you see is what you get it looks cute it looks cute I definitely like I said I gave it five stars and it's a little bit I don't understand why they don't want you to dry it and no one has got back to me on that because like I said they're a little bit big so I don't understand why I can't dry it and take care of that situation but again and they're soft the material is soft you don't feel like you're wearing jeans cuz I hold on to jeans so I mean I have jeans with no elastic which is is trippy and then you pull on your life skinny jeans so the other night I was like had a sweatshirt on in the jeans and it felt like jammy pants that sounds weird I know an excuse all of my talk text mistakes I am pretending that I don't need glasses but I'm trying to find an opening before the end of the year to get glasses and then I'll be able to take pictures and you'll understand me more but again I would recommend them tall short little booty hips no hips I was shocked let me just tell you like I said I ordered all three",

                "reviewText": "I am 5'9\" and 156 lbs. I ordered the large size, and they are really too big. I decided to keep them anyway and try to shrink them down. The material is very soft and stretchy. They look great and they are not that ripped as to draw major attention to you. This is the first pair of ripped jeans I have owned. So far, so good. I asked my son if I was too old to wear them and he laughed and so, \"No, mom, they make you look younger\". Probably flattering me, but I bought it anyway. You are only as old as you feel. The color is dark to lighter blue and looks perfect. One of the features that these jeans have are the cool buttons. Nice purchase, and if you want something a little more fitting, order a size down.",
