I will definitely buy again. For reference I am 5\u20194\u201d 140 pounds and bought size 7. Great fit!",

                "reviewText": "I used the try at home to order a box of jeans and get a good fit. These look OK and fit OK when I first put them on, but as the day wears on, they stretch out. The fabric is thicker than I like for jeans. The boot cut for the normal length is very long, has too much flare, and has a lot of fabric at the bottom, more than the picture appears. Therefore they look bunchy when i roll them up a bit, which is what i usually do with jeans, since I am too tall for a short length and not quite tall enough for a regular length. I will probably not order this brand again.",
