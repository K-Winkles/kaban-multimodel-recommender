I probably could have used 31\" inseam but I think it went from 30\" to 32\" and I think 32\" would have been too long. Ordering the size was confusing to me. But it was listed as 9-30 and that meant size 9 jean with 30\" inseam. If you are any taller than 5'5\" you definitely want a 32\" inseam.",

They have a nice stretch and the fabric feels soft but kinda heavy so should last . I still prefer a lower rise and these say low rise but i personally feel like it\u2019s a mid rise but those for me are really hard to find . I like them enough that i order 2 more pair .",

I don't feel like I am part of the crew in Alien (IYKYK). The fabric is soft and not super clingy, but there's some give. And last, they are long enough to cover my ankles when I sit, but I'm not stepping on them when i walk. I immediately ordered another pair in a different color. Well done, Wrangler. Well done.",

                "reviewText": "It's so great to be able to buy boot cut jeans at the right length, and these jeans are everything I was hoping for, in terms of fit and style. I stand 5'2\" tall; measurements are waist 34\", hips 42\", inseam 30\". I bought size 13-30, which fits perfectly (although for the second pair I just ordered, I'm going with 13-32, because I want a bit more length to wear with boots). On me, they are low-rise as expected, and flattering -- I love how they look on me! I think they have just the right amount of stretch -- a bit of give for comfort, while still maintaining their shape...and mine. They are well made, with some nice construction details, such as a line of rubberized stitching along the inside edges of the no-gap waistband to prevent your shirt from riding up, the watch pocket with the Wrangler \"W\" worked into the stitching, and those full-sized front pockets. I'd like give a shout-out to others who left detailed reviews, good and bad, about the fit (especially Fej Family who included photos) -- which were very helpful.",
