So I have been scared to buy jeans as I don\u2019t know my size anymore but these are great!! I bought a medium and they are so stretchy I could have honestly bought a small. Love that the high rise goes above the belly button to help control my mom pooch. But really. They are more comfortable than most leggings! Get the look of cute jeans and the comfort of your favorite leggings! Buy them!",

I only tried them on and already after 5 min linen all over them and I could not wait to take them off, my skin feels so scratchy. I\u2019m a dissapointed as for almost 50 dollars product I would expect better quality for the fabric, I\u2019m sad to return them as they fit me so good.",
