                "reviewText": "Wow, these actually fit and are made of real denim!I do a lot of outside work, ride horses, fix fences, and get dirty outside. I wear jeans all the time so they have to look decent as well. I've gone through lots of brands of jeans. Whenever I find some that fit and wear well I just keep buying the same jean over and over. Nearly all jeans made now are stretch and last a season at most because the fabric is thin and can't stand up to actually doing anything in the jeans. Relaxed fit or loose fit has been replaced by skinny, meaning you can't actually do anything in them and they're uncomfortable. The last pair I bought are so stretchy that after a long day of wear I'm constantly pulling them up because they're so stretched out of shape. When I put them on they fit about right, but by the afternoon they look like clown pants. I don't want thin stretchy denim!I haven't found a decent pair of jeans in a couple of years and have been making do, then saw these. They aren't skinny or snug, they're loose enough that you can actually do things in them. Yet they are made out of real denim so they should wear.I admit I literally just took them out of the Amazon box and put them on and was so thrilled I had to write the review right away. I can't review the wear, but they fit well, and the denim is thick and sturdy as denim should be, but not too stiff that it's uncomfortable. The waist is where it should be, the pockets are roomy and sit where they should. I've just added a couple more pairs in my Amazon shopping cart so I'm pretty convinced.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these because I was looking for 100% cotton jeans in a heavier weight. When I tried these Wranglers on, they fit reasonably well. A little tight in the waist and a bit short in the rise, but basically ok, since I don't like the legs of my jeans to look as if they were painted on. However, they have \"grown\" with every wearing, and are now huge in the seat and enormous in the thighs, at least 2 sizes larger than what would be expected from the fit of the waistband, which has only grown a bit. I'm going to try washing them in super-hot water, but I don't think even that will rescue the them. I could take them in, but it would be a ton of work for an inexpensive pair of jeans, because to make them look right, they need to have more fabric removed from the back than the front., which means I'd have to remove all the stitching from the hems and leg seams and recut each leg narrower before resewing and rehemming. Of course, the return window has already closed. BEWARE!",

                "reviewText": "Why is it so difficult to find good old fashion 100% Cotton jeans? I use to buy Lands End 100% cotton jeans, and didn't mind paying the $45- $50 a pair because they were well made and held up. But now, LE has gone cheap (in materials, not price) and flimsy and no longer carry the cotton jeans so I had to go in search of another brand. These were the only reasonably priced jeans that I could find that did not have spandex in them. I hate spandex! It gives the material a weird feel and they don't hold up as well as old fashion 100% cotton jeans. I wasn't sure what kind of quality I was going to get with these, so I decided to order them from Amazon because of the great return policy. I was very pleasantly surprised when I got them. They fit great and are really sturdy jeans. If I had to complain about something, it would be that these jeans only come in one color and that is dark blue. I wish they would make the lighter shades. The color on these jeans is so colorfast, that you can't even bleach them lighter. I tried and I don't think they ended up even 1 shade lighter. I can see that these are going to take quite a few washings before I can get them to look old. But this is good because that means that they will last for years.So bottom line is that if you are looking for great sturdy jeans, I would highly recommend that you give these a try.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted relaxed wide legs because I wear a 14 - 16 with a pretty darn big tummy and flabby fat thighs. Well these seemed to fit at the waste nicely, ever with my big muffin top. The thighs were a bit loose but not too bad. But they are just as wide at the foot as they are at the thigh so they are really weird. By the end of the day however, they had stretched so much they were falling off and so baggy it was embarrassing. So I got these Lee Women's Relaxed Fit Straight Leg Jean and they fit great. They are the prefect not too skinny not too wide. If you are looking for \"Mom\" jeans, these fit great for an over wight 60 year old. Not baggy, not tight so you see the flab. I tiny bit of a flare at the foot. Good for shoes or boots. and nice sized pockets.",
