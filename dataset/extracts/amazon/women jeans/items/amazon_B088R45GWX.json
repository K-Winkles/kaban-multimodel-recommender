I thought that jeans didn't look good on me anymore was because I was older and older and just gave in. LEE proved me wrong. YAY!! Got a mid rise but they fit me like a high rise which is fine with me. Perfect in every way and I immediately ordered another pair before they sold out. They actually look good on me. WOW. Score! Look at the sizing though, I had to size down (!) another feel good benefit courtesy of LEE.",

There isn\u2019t much discernible difference in these 2 sizes. I wound up keeping the 14p for comfort on my stomach and returned the 12p. For reference I\u2019m 5\u2019 and 145-150lbs, 65+ years.
