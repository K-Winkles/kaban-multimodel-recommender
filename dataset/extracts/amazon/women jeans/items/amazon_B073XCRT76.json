Also, I'm a petite but these are the perfect length. 5'8 with short legs, the hem stops at my ankles. When first getting these, the blue will fade so be sure to wash with like colors. The denim is very dark but will eventually after a few washings turn to a normal color. Either way, these jeans are fantastic.",
