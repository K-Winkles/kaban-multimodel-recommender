Taking the fact that they didn't even come close to fitting out of the equation, these pants were well made and the fabric was a nice quality. They fit nicely in length and through the thighs, but the waist was cut so small, I had about a foot of open space between the buttons to close them. If you have a size 18 bottom but a size 10 waist, these are the pants for you.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Scottsdale arrived with pre-scrubbed worn in knees. Thumbnail photo aboves does not show this.",
                "reviewText": "Yes this color is described as a washed jean but that still should appear like the photo and not have areas rubbed lighter colored such as the knees. If so then the photo needs to show this in the thumbnails here on Amazons sale page when you select this color. IT DOES NOT. So it lost a star for that and I feel like making it two to three stars down really. However I needed new jeans as I am on my last new package of my favorite pairs no longer made and wanted a true dark shade. I have lighter blues that are fine for my daily casual wear but now and again when I feel like being a bit more dressed up or casual dressed up I like the dark or black jeans. So I ordered this color because Portland color was out even though even today it still shows you can select my size but when you do your told it is out of stock. I would now be afraid to order the Portland too for fear it too would come with pre scrubbed washed out knees. I prefer to wear my darker jeans in by myself and buy the lighter blues where I am less fussy but even those I do not want pre-rubbed lighter spots that can literally damage the jeans and cause them to wear out much faster than I would myself do it.For size a P length fits best in length these are short and in some brands that is just fine but in these they are still fallng below my instep so I either have to roll them up a bit or hem them shorter. It's the reason I buy the short or petite so I don't have to. I also ordered a pair of black in the petite but only because they did not come in the short and today they don't have the petite size I ordered either in black. I am not sure when Amazon and seller will get a good update on color and size selection but dang this is annoying because almost none are available in most of the common sizes regular or short or petite. I will buy a regular length and just hem too if that was even available. So I've been buying this brand via Costco for years now however the last time I bought two pairs from Costco last fall they did not fit and had to be returned. This is a big problem because we live 100 miles from Costco or 200 mile round trip so it's not like we go often. Meantime I was shocked they did not fit as it was my regular size and same size I ordered here and Costco's did not fit. Also my last two pairs of Gloria's did not wear well while I have a pair now over 5 years old of her's that are still almost like new and comfortable and worn a lot so quality in materials used and size variations in one size as of late is just not reliable like it used to be. Gloria are you even listening? Right I know no one is. With Covid now hitting I thought I'd be able to pick up my basic jean needs with this order and going off the thumbnail photos where there is no worn spots on the knees or lighter spots anywhere else shown or highlighted via photos provided with that color selection I ordered with fingers crossed they would fit. Fit was ok though could be a bit better but sometimes with most jeans you need to wear them a few times and wash a few times to find them fitting better. I suffer from chonic edema condition that changes my leg size but not usually size of jeans itself so a jean that hangs loose one day a week later could be much tighter so I am not a fan of the tight jeans and need some looser leg to them. But I do not want my jeans baggy by any means either. I just wish makers would stick with trusted materials and designs so you could feel secure in ordering the same style over the years. Brand, a design by the same name year to year in other words should continue to fit the same year to year in the same size and quality of material and workmanship also should be reliable from year to year. Cleary this line and brand is not.",

Alle anderen habe ich in den USA gekauft . Mit der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe war es etwas schwierig, die richtige zu finden. Die Gr\u00f6\u00dfenangaben weichen stark voneinander ab.",
