The ad emphasizes \u201cbutt lifting\u201d spandex, which must cause modest folks to keep looking elsewhere for their blue jeans.I overheard a stranger at a restaurant raving to her friend about them. The stranger said she got her blue jeans on Amazon and loved them. They didn\u2019t look bad on her, so I got out my phone and found them on Amazon.Upon seeing the ad, I wouldn\u2019t think of buying them for my wife. That big butt photo, and attention called to the \u201cbutt lifting\u201d spandex, are poor choices by the advertising professionals. Still, the stranger\u2019s overheard praising and endorsement drew me into buying them for my wife, who needs no butt lifting, thank you very much.My wife now has a pair of comfortable blue jeans that use just the right amount (2%) of spandex. She wore her Christmas gift the day after Christmas, and smiled all day because they fit just right. They conform nicely to her, without being embarrassingly snug. These jeans do look nice and fit well.The advertising suggests the jeans\u2019 spandex do some magic to enhance assets. That likely turns away potential buyers who don\u2019t notice the spandex is only 2%. Only 2% spandex won't cause \u201cspandex cling\u201d that most buyers would find embarrassingly, and uncomfortably, revealing. Only 2% spandex is too insignificant to do that. It will, however, give just the right amount of spandex to comfortably fit, look good, but without looking too tight like in the photo.Bad ad, totally appropriate jeans.",

Only complaint was the zipper... the zipper doesn't stay up at all and they're not tight, they're kinda loose if anything so idk what the problem is! Definitely going to order other colors. Hopefully the zipper on those are more sturdy.",
