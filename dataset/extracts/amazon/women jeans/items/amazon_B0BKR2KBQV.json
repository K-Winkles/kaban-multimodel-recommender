                "reviewText": "I'm one of those people who have hips that are significantly wider than my waist - when I was younger I had a 24\" waist and 39\" hips! I still have those 39\" hips but as anyone knows, once you're over 30 that waist tends to be uncooperative lolThese jeans fit my waist and my hips PERFECTLY! It's so great to find jeans that fit curvier people - usually I have to pick whether they're obscenely tight in the rear or falling down and showing off my underwear in the waist (especially when I sit lol.) I have sensory and back issues so wearing belts isn't always possible. These jeans completely solve that problem.They're very comfy and are very high quality as Levi's tend to be. I don't doubt these jeans will last for years - heck, I have a pair of Levi's I bought when I was 25 and 11 years later they're still going strong even though they're getting frequently abused when I do yard work!You can't beat the price, either. I've had many designer jeans over the years that cost $50+ and were nowhere near this level of quality and comfort; most of said designer jeans wore out within 2-3 years and others didn't even last that long! So these days I go with what's proven to withstand the test of time, and Levi's are my go-to for that when it comes to my jeans!",

                "reviewText": "however..., I only gave them 4 stars because it states mid-rise on the product information and they shipped me high-rise. I don't know if that's Amazon or the seller, but I wanted the medium rise.Nonetheless, I am keeping them for 2 reasons. The first being that they are great fitting and feeling. I wanted flare jeans more importantly than mid-rise so I am willing to settle on receiving high rise. They still fit well. I am 5'8\" and about 175 pounds. I normally wear a Levi's 28 medium/regular/standard and tried these Levi's Signature size 6 which was supposed to be the same and they were spot on. Just wish they were mid-rise.The second reason I am keeping them is honestly because since they fit, I am lazy and don't want to go through the hassle of shipping them back to get another pair. They look good and feel good regardless, so I will just admit I'm lazy.I also got the darker ones and they messed up again and sent True Boot and they were mid-rise and thankfully their idea of bootcut fits like flare jeans anyway. These were mid-rise at least and marked flare and are, so I'm happy. Comfy good jeans just seems like a dice roll to get what you ordered, at least it was on 2 counts for me.4 stars for sizing errors, but good fitting and comfortable jeans and quality.",

                "reviewText": "I originally order my regular size, but it was too big so I had to return and size back. But these were a great price, had great stretch and a flattering fit. I'm trying to move away from jegging skinny jeans, but I don't like the feeling for the waist band of most regular jeans. These are high-waisted enough and stretch enough that they don't dig in my stomach. I'm 5'7 and the length was perfect for me for boots or shoes (may drag if I wore something like a very flat ballet flat).",

They just don't fit me right, and I hate the muffin top effect. I spent over $100 on a pair of jeans at Dillard's that don't even come close to these in comfort or fit. These are an excellent bargain. I just bought another pair in the lighter color, and a smaller size.",
