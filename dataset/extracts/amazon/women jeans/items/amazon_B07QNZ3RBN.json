                "reviewText": "Although reviews are varied, I decided to take a swing at these \"curvy skinny jeans\" - a first for me. I am 58, 5'5\" and 178 lbs. Kinda pear-shaped - thick in the legs and no longer as small in the waist as I used to be. Was looking for a jean look that would fit my fuller calves to wear with boots. After reading the reviews wasn't sure what to expect, but when I tried them on I was very pleasantly surprised in most ways.PROS: A trim jean look, small enough waist to not slide down, but not so small that I can't breathe, enough stretch for comfort, and best of all, a perfect fit for my slightly heavy legs to tuck into boots.CONS: the black rinse isn't black at all. Very deep denim blue instead.The material seems ok now, but it's just flimsy enough that I wonder how long they will look good. I will wash them in cold with woolite and hang them to dry. Anyone drying a fabric this stretchy in the dryer is just asking for their clothing to disintegrate.Also, if you are very slender in the legs and bigger around the middle, these probably won't be ideal if you are looking for something form-fitting.Will update this in a few weeks as I see how these jeans perform.:-)",

But when a self-described apple shaped and short \"mid sized\" influencer suggested these jeans, I decided to try them.Pluses:-Shorter inseam perfect for those of us that are less than 5' 2\"-Good waist to hip ratio (for those of us who have hips and curves)-Enough stretch to fit around the lumps, but not too much to stretch out and sagFlattering dark wash (and per the instructions on the packaging, I washed them first to avoid color rubbing off)Minuses-Not the softest material (don't expect them to feel like those high-end brands)-Feels like it won't last a super long time (but priced accordingly) - I will update my review if I find it wears out too quickly",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Dark Wash and Rinse are the same color",
                "reviewText": "I started off only buying the one pair, but was so pleased with the fit that I ordered another 2 in \"different\" colors. All together, I've got the \"light wash\", \"rinse\", and \"dark wash\".One thing I really really love about these pants is the consistent sizing. Whenever I find a pair of jeans that fit good, I tend to buy all the colors. But I've never had a brand before where the fit was perfectly the same on every pair. However, that is absolutely the case here. Very impressed. Personally I find the sizing spot on. I'm between a 14 and a 16, I ordered the 16, and I could probably size down if I really wanted to, but I'm happy with how these fit as a 16.I only wear jeans to work in, and I'm extremely happy with how comfortable these are. The stretch is unbelievable. Definitely closer to jeggings than denim jeans, but with better support and a more comfortable waist than typical jeggings (plus actual pockets!!!). But squatting all day in these is not a problem at all. They move with me so effortlessly.As for my complaints. Unfortunately because the material is so extremely not denim, after just one day of wear, the inner thighs started pilling. So I don't really have high hopes that they'll last very long before they rub so thin they rip. But even in actual denim, that's always the fate of my jeans after about 4 months anyways. And these are pretty cheap, so I'm definitely willing to see how well they compare.And weirdly enough (this is not a problem I've ever had, so I don't know what causes this), you have to be very careful to pull them on straight. Otherwise, for me, the back seam ends up a solid inch too far to the left of my crack. Which, since these are so form fitting to the booty, is very noticeable. Maybe I would be better off with a 14? Like if they were tighter, they could only go on straight? I don't know. But, worth the mention.And my final complaint is that two of their colors, rinse and dark wash, are IDENTICAL. I've included photos as proof, where I've labeled which leg is which \"color\". (For the record, the \"rinse\" side is only baggy looking because I'm wearing it overtop the dark wash). So. Maybe don't bother getting both colors. I'm also thinking \"light wash\" and \"medium wash\" may be the same, because their photos looked as similar as the \"rinse\" and \"dark wash\" did. But I'm so sure that that's the case that I have no interest in ordering the \"medium wash\", so I'll never know.",

                "reviewText": "I have bought this same brand in just the regular skinny (not high waisted) in 2 colors. The dark blue ones, which fit great though slightly tight in the calves and black ones, which are, for some reason, really tight on the calves (seem to be cut differently, not so comfy). I just received the High Rise ones in the medium wash. These are SO Fabulous! VERY comfortable, not overly tight, so if you're looking for a tight-tight skinny jean, these aren't it. These are soft, medium high-waisted (over the belly button), flattering to my figure (5'0 and around 127 lbs, and a bit hipp-y). I've worn them 2 days in a row I love them so much. The length of short is perfect for a 5' person, they're stretchy enough to flatter though too much stretch isn't really needed since they aren't super tight, they just move with you without pinching or clinging to your legs. They are absolutely perfect. I'm definitely going to order more in this cut! Highly recommend!",
