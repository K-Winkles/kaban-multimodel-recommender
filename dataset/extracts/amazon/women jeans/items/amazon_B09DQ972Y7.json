                "reviewText": "After purchasing (and returning) a variety of jeans from Amazon, I finally found a pair that I like! These Jag Carter Girlfriend jeans are so cute and have just the right amount of distressing, and I like the Thorne Blue, a darker medium shade of blue (too often I find boyfriend jeans are lightwash with large knee holes). The rise is pretty high, about an inch under my belly button, but they are not super baggy, just the perfect amount of relaxed, so it works. I did size down from my normal size 12 to size 10, and I\u2019m very glad I did; they definitely run oversized and there is a bit of stretch in the denim. I love the length; I can roll them twice and they land about two inches above my ankle (I dislike short boyfriend jeans). These are seriously the most comfortable pair of jeans I own! Very pleased!",

As is typical of JAG jeans, they have plenty of room in the hips and thighs, and these crop jeans are constructed of suuuper soft, very stretchy denim. Irresistibly cute with the embroidered flower, raw edge cuffs. The denim has just the right amount of color wearing in the front thigh and seat for spring/summer wear, and the top edges of the back pockets have the slightest distressing (you can barely see it, but it's cool). For reference, I'm 5'11\"/190 lbs with muscular (rower) thighs and a butt...size 14 is perfect (that's my usual pant size).",
