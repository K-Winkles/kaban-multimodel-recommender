It has a lot of stretch to it and will look nice. I gave it 4 stars due to it being a little more baggy than I wanted. Overall it\u2019s a nice pair of jeans. I am tall and like the length.",

                "reviewText": "I don't write reviews even for products that I love. For the tall women like me who are seeking a pant that actually hit the floor, though, I felt it was necessary to let you know that this pant does the job. It even completely covers my belly button without the inseam touching my lady parts, or the front getting that weird, baggy wrinkled effect. I am 5'9 160lbs with a boxy 33\" waist. Size 12 fits very comfortably without any bulging at the waistline. It has an all-way stretch while still looking very much like a pair of jeans, and not at all like jeggings. I feel like it may shrink in the dryer just enough to feel snug while maintaining all of these features I love. If it does, I intend to order more colors because I finally feel casually cute and like I'm in my correct size.",
