First off, I ordered the short so I wouldn't have to sew them and they were still a couple of inches too long (5'2\"). Secondly, I feel like they are a little too roomy for the amount of stretch they have, what I mean is even with a belt they sink down and then I have saggy butt. I think the next size down would have been too small though. They are decent pants overall though.",

I do not have much of a waist (hello rectangle body shape!) so I have to be quite careful wearing jeans that are too low or too high of a rise. These are \"mid rise\" but are almost high rise on me due to my short waist. They hit at the perfect spot! The length is great too. The regular length was perfect which is RARE. I almost always have to buy long/tall but not these! I could even pair a small heeled boot to work. The dark wash is a great color. It is dark enough to dress up if your work allows. I'm a teacher and they are comfortable AND dressy enough for casual Friday! The price is unbelievable. I obviously have only worn them once so I'm not sure how long they will last, but they seem just as durable as brands like Old Navy. I'm really pleased with this pair of denim!",
