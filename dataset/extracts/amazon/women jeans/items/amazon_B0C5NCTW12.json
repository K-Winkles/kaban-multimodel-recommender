                "reviewText": "Being a mature woman I like and need jeans that are high rise and the waistband stays put without sliding down my backside. I would rather not be pulling my jeans up multiple times over the course of a day. Finding high waist jeans that are flattering and don't look like mom jeans can take some looking around too sometimes. I like form fitting jeans and these fit the bill all around. Once I found my right size the jeans felt comfortable, and the waistband, which covers my navel, stayed in place and kept me from having a muffin top. I would suggest maybe trying out two pairs of jeans when thinking about purchasing a pair. The reason being since I ordered my regular size at first (I have worn a Reg. size 10 in Lee jeans before) but this time the waistband was too tight after buttoning it and the legs felt a little snug too. So, I returned the size 10 and re-ordered a Reg. size 12 and they fit just fine and feel so comfortable even after all day wear--and no stretching out of the waistband. Since these jeans can be ordered Free Prime Try Before you Buy it might help to order the 2 sizes to see what fits best--your regular size and a size larger. The reason for the 4 stars was due to sizing issues, but once I sized up things were fine. Hope all this helps!",
