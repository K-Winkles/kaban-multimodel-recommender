I am 5\u20192\u201d with a 36\u201d waist and weigh more than I should. The bling/design on pockets looks great. Front pockets are deeper than some jeans, but I wish they were deeper like the mens pockets so to be more functional. The waistline does come up higher which I really like.Being 5\u20192\u201d, I need a \u201cshort\u201d length of which I ordered, but I received a \u201cregular\u201d length by mistake. Unfortunately, my husband was sick and I was distracted and missed date to return/exchange so the last pair received are way too long.",
