However, I've been wearing the same size for a while, and I had to go up a size which surprised me.EDIT: I have bought five pairs of these jeans now. I guess there are differences in the colours. First three pairs were a 12. My two pairs I have in 12 now fit slightly lose but not baggy. Just not like a sardine. I love those. So, I bought more and the two I have now are size 14's. They both fit like I'm a sardine in a can. Very tight. I don't like that. Not sure if it's a size change, they did or if its something else. But my next pair will be a 16 which is very odd because I'm losing weight and have 10-12s in my closet that fit loser than their 14. They are comfortable but I don't like how tight the 14s are. :(",

For reference I am 5\u20197\u201d and wear a size 12 in jeans/pants and these fit, but the waist is a little funky. It seems to fold down on one side, but it\u2019s not too small. Looking at the jeans before I put them on I didn\u2019t think they were going to fit, but they did. These are very stretchy and seem decently constructed, but they do feel on the cheaper side so unsure if they will last. The cut is skinny ish as the ankles are not super tight, but not baggy enough to be considered straight.All and all, if you want an affordable pair of jeans that look decent enough these fit the bill. Nothing special, but nothing terrible either. Unsure if I will keep, but if I do I will update as I wear them.",
