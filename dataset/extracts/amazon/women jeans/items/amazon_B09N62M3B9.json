I am a size 28 in Levi\u2019s 311 and 711 styles so I took recommendation to size up to 29. I ended up needing to size down to a 27, but all the returns were worth it. No gap in the back, no pooch in the crotch and I feel lifted and sculpted without being stiff or uncomfortable. Rise is just right not too high. Only wish is for longer inseam options and more color ways/washes.",

After reading the other reviews I decided to completely size up. I figured better too large than too small. I should have ordered a 29 (8?). There\u2019s a little give in the jeans once you wear them for a few hours and after that they were pretty much giving me a baggy butt lol. They would be SO cute if I ordered the correct size. They have a button fly which is nice. They are pretty much made of cotton (per the tag) so I\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll shrink in the dryer. Hope this helps! I got the color which does not have rips in the legs!",

                "reviewText": "Reviews recommended sizing up as the jeans run small with no stretch so I ordered a 29 instead of my usual 28 in Tango Talks. Unfortunately they were much to large in the waist and had a nice amount of stretch (not too stretchy but with some give for comfort), so I exchanged them for my usual size 28. I am a little suspicious that the 28s I recieved were not genuine Levis as they were still too big in the waist (and I have worn Levi's size 28 for years), AND the fabric had dramatically more stretch than the 29s I had originally ordered. They were also clearly a return as the sizing sticker had been peeled off and put back on the butt and the rest of the tags were all bent and ratty. That being said, I might take a chance and reorder in 27s to see if I can make these work because I can see them being a favorite if I can find the right fit. Clearly the sizing is a bit inconsistent between colors so make sure to read reviews of the specific color you are interested in and order accordingly.",

I have several pairs of vintage Levi jeans\u2014 my \u2018youngest\u2019 pair is from 2010. Those babies have lasted me years, they fit beautifully, they feel and wear and look of great American quality. The big label is fabric and something to boast about. I mean, I love me Levi Jeans.But these?! What in tarnation?! I\u2019m a petite 2-4, always have been. My body size hasn\u2019t changed that much since middle school (which may or may not be something to admit). So when I have a pile of Levi jeans that are such a size, and I order a newer made one, I expect the same quality. That\u2019s fair. Right?Nope.No!Didn\u2019t happen.I had to order 2 pairs to figure out that I\u2019m now considered a 6. Yet here I am still walking around in 2-4s.. I\u2019m a bit confused. The jeans felt degrading and are. The material was cheap. The label was like plastic!!! I mean what is happening?! What. Is. Happening?Boy, am I glad I went Prime Wardrobe and didn\u2019t spend anything... wow.Although, since we are on the subject: Prime Wardrobe is kind of a joke. Their customer service was really nice, but it took them almost a month just to process that I\u2019d returned the item, even though tracking verified the jeans (both pairs) had been delivered to their facility within 3days of a return. I mean wow.Wow!I will never get Levi jeans again unless they\u2019re secondhand or Etsy. Sorry. But .... wow. Shame on Levi\u2019s for quitting like that BUT ESPECIALLY for price gouging on poor quality.",

I did order a size 30 because I tend to be in between sizes (8-10). I could\u2019ve gotten away with a 29, because the waist is a little loose in the 30s, so I would recommend to size down if you\u2019re in between sizes.Follow me on Instagram for more outfit and lifestyle tips @elisabethgoldschmitt",
