                "reviewText": "I like these jeans and all the Democracy brand jeans I've owned. I own this pair in multiple colors/washes. They're super comfy, particularly at the waistband, but they're much slower to get baggy (like at the knees or bum) as you wear them than other stretchy jeans I own.A note on sizing- Amazon's pants size recommendations are usually pretty accurate for me, but for these jeans they suggest a size 8 and I've found the size 6 to fit very well. In general, I usually wear a 6 (or 28-29) on average in pants. My actual waist measurement is about 30\" and my hip is 40\"-41\". I'm 5'2\", about 140 lbs and relatively muscle-y in the thigh and calf. I'd say I have (sadly) only a modest amount of bum.For those that sew and/or know a bit about tailoring- like many people, I have to do sway-back adjustments on patterns. For ready to wear clothing, it's hard to find pants where the front rise isn't both too long and too shallowly cut, which creates that unattractive sag-fold-thingy at the front crotch. I've found democracy jeans to fit better in that regard than other brands.",

They fit true to size for me. Though they are supposed to be cropped, because of my height I can wear them as regular ankle-length jeans as well as roll them for a cropped look. I am very happy with this purchase. They\u2019re soft and comfy and not stiff. They do help hold in your stomach a bit, too. They did have a bit of a plastic smell when I took them out of the package but I wash clothes before wearing them so this wasn\u2019t a problem for me.",
