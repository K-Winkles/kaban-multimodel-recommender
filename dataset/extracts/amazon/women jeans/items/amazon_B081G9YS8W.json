With my other pregnancies I was able to bounce back fairly quickly, but I'm older now and I had twins. I've been so frustrated trying to find jeans that will fit my new body shape. Well, I have found them! These jeans aren't so high rise that they touch my bra (lol), but not too low either. I love the cut, not skinny, but hugs all the right curves. Plus, they are stretchy but still hold me together! I work as a Rural US Mail Carrier and needed jeans that I could work in while still feeling cute. These jeans are perfect.",

                "reviewText": "This was my first \"regular\" pair of jeans (not baggy or leggings) since entering my mom-bod phase, so I was a little nervous, and had my doubts about the shaping capabilities. However, they somehow manage to flatten out my lower belly and yet don't leave me with a muffin top. They are tight without quite reaching skinny jean territory. I'm probably on the bigger side of size 12 (thighs, hips, butt, and belly) but I almost sized down due to some reviews saying they stretched during the day. I'm very glad I didn't size up or down. I do need to wear a belt with these, as they do kind of start to sag a little if I don't. However, I feel if I sized down, they'd have been too tight on my butt or hips, and a size bigger would have been too big at the waist. Every body is different, so you may have to try a different size if you're normally a perfect 12, but these did the trick for me. They also don't have the obvious whiskering that the picture shows, which I'm happy about.",

Great stretch in them, flattering on the booty side, light tummy control up front, straight leg without being baggy nor too tight. I ordered a tall and they were finally just the right length. I normally wear a 6 in jeans but had to size down to a 4 so they fit well. For reference, I am 5 feet 8 inches tall with a longer than average inseam. The 4 talls were perfection! They hit below my ankle so I can wear as is with flats, or I can give a small cuff, or there is enough length if I wanted to wear a short heeled boot or something. No more high waters!",

I have a small waist, bigger hips and a slightly bigger butt so it\u2019s hard to find pants that fit right. I ended up with size 2 short (Waist 26 Length 30). And they are a perfect fit!! They hit right at the ankle so not to long that they drag on the floor and not to short like ankle pants. They have a good stretch to them so that\u2019s why the 4s were a little to big. They washed and dried great still holding shape.Hope this review helps!!",

I am 152cm and got the \u2018short\u2019 jean, it is the perfect length for my height.These jeans are not jegging material, they are denim, but have some stretch to them and fit nicely. The waist is at my belly button, and the back of the jeans fully cover everything. The jeans have structure, but are still comfortable.They look nice, and feel good.",
