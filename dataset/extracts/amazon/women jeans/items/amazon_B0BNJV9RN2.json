The jeans have a trendy and relaxed look that I absolutely love. The fabric feels durable and comfortable, and I appreciate the attention to detail in the stitching and design.However, I did find that the legs were slightly too wide for my body type. I'm petite and have wide hips, so the wide leg style didn't flatter my figure as much as I had hoped. I prefer a more narrow leg that accentuates my curves without overwhelming them. These jeans would probably look amazing on someone who is a bit taller or has more narrow hips.Despite this, I still think these jeans are worth considering if you're looking for a stylish and high-quality pair of wide leg jeans. Just keep in mind that they might not be the best fit for those with a petite frame or wider hips. I'll continue my search for a pair with a more narrow leg, but I can see these jeans being a great choice for someone with a different body type.\"",

                "reviewText": "I put these jeans on immediately upon receiving them and they fit so I continued to wear them throughout the day. I first noticed some slight staining on the thigh and I figured I must have accidentally wiped something on them or had gotten something on them from my children. However, I was APPALLED to notice at the end of the day that these were CLEARLY used and returned, as I noticed a slightly yellow but very crusty and clearly dirty stained crotch area on inside, not going through to the outside. As if someone had worn them previously with no underwear. This was not from me as I was wearing undergarments as well as a feminine product that would prevent this type of thing from occurring. I was disgusted as I had worn them all day without noticing and had taken off the tags and everything else so i couldn't return them by then. They fit great around the waist, a little short for me (5' 6\"). Just be aware and make sure to wash your items before wearing them.",

This pair was no different and is quite big on me around the waist and hips. Also, I\u2019m 5\u20194 and these jeans are extremely long! I had to cut them. Still very cute and I know Levi\u2019s premiums are expensive but will last forever if cared for properly",
