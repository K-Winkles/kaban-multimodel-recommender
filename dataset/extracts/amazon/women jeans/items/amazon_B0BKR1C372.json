Most of my weight sits in my stomach and I wanted these to be loose so I ordered a 16. They fit like a glove. Which isn\u2019t exactly what I wanted. However I did get them for Christmas so holiday weight also may have played a role. They look great on and are not too tight but they just aren\u2019t loose either. I\u2019m keeping them but for a true loose fit pair of jeans I might look elsewhere.",

I read the reviews stating that these seem to run big on others so I took a gamble and ordered a size 2 since I consider myself to be on the lower end of a size 4 currently. These fit my body to a T and honestly look AMAZING on so much so that I'm buying a size 4 to have as a back up since personally my weight fluctuates. Plus I always buy extras of things I truly love since I'm picky and it's getting harder to find things I like at a decent price. These are definitely worth trying!",

And the legs were super long too so I had to roll them up. Other than that I still wear them and they comfortable and have a good stretch",

I wore them once, and after about an hour I could feel some irritation on the outside of my left thigh, so I checked it out and saw raw, red irritation. I put a bandaid on it and when I removed them at the end of the day I had 3 other HUGE blisters on my derriere. I didn't feel anything irritating those areas all day and it made me think maybe it was some kind of chemical irritation. I've washed them since and as soon as the blisters heal I'll try again. It's probably too late to return them if it happens again.",
