                "reviewText": "Comfy but the waist size is off. I got a size 10 Petite (short) because I wasn\u2019t sure how the size would be. I usually wear a juniors size 7/9 or size 6/8 women\u2019s. I am 5\u20193 and 140ish lbs. The waist on these runs REALLY small. The size 10 measures 14\u201d flat and the waistband has like a thick piece of elastic band inside. It sounds comfy but when the waist is already small for the size, it doesn\u2019t stretch much and gives a bad muffin top. It doesn\u2019t stretch to the size on the tag. If I bought a 12 they might be super comfy, though I don\u2019t feel I should size up 3 sizes to get the right fit. The quality feels really nice for the price but the sizing is weird. The petite fit me cropped when they\u2019re supposed to be full length. I got a petite thinking the waist would be made to fit a petite torso like my other Lee\u2019s (stretch flex bootcut size 8). It\u2019s still really high and I\u2019m a petite with all legs and basically no torso. Although this is a great concept and great price, I can\u2019t rate high because I bought a size up and it still fit so small!",

I'm not exactly a curvy woman, and these pants made sure to emphasize that fact, completely removing any butt I thought I had. They were also too short. I am 5'2, not exactly tall, and the legs ended at least an inch above my ankles. These pants were probably designed with someone curvy in mind.",
