                "reviewText": "I ordered an 18wp (womans petite). Being rather short (5',3\") & still dropping the lbs, the fit was iffy no matter how I looked at it ... However, to my great suprise, the fit was almost perfect :)... The waist sits just above the belly-botton. On my frame the length is a bit long & requires turning the pant leg, with a 2' cuff twice. There is no bunching at the waist or any place else.AND these Jeans have 5 pockets \ud83c\udf1f! With the minor exception of the pant leg length (mine are going to be shortened tomorrow) these are without a doubt the most comfortable and easy to wear jeans I've worn in years.. I'm planning on purchasing several additional pairs when I can wear a smaller size... If I could, I'd happily give my PajamaJeans Woman's Stretch Jeans at least 10 to 12 stars. I hope this information helps you with your shopping decisions.",

I am 180# and 5\"3\" and I loathe skinny jeans. I think the tight ankles makes everyone look like an ice cream cone, and I definitely don't think they flatter me. I want jeans that don't drag on the ground, and I actually have grown a bit tired of jean zippers bunching up when I sit or squat. My search history is littered with \"18 Short elastic waist straight leg jeans\" and I have tried them all. I even tried a pair of standard Pajama jeans that were skinny legged and too long. The Pajama jean petites didn't fit because I am not short waisted, just short legged. Then THESE came in the mail....and I fell in love! Ordered 4 pairs immediately! With the rolled cuff, they are perfect! Flattering, comfortable, and wonderful looking! I highly recommend!",

Those almost fit, but it was just a bit too much work to get them over my belly, so I returned them and tried XL. XL fit my belly great, but they were weirdly tight in the butt! I have always had a booty, and I've been really working on my fitness this year, and doing a lot of squats. That's actually what led me to try these. I realize skinny jeans are pass\u00e9 but I was still wearing them, right up until my growing muscles started making them fit a little more like a denim prison than anything else. The Pajama Jeans felt great on my legs. I will give them that. I'm also only 4'11\", and the inseam (with cuffs rolled) was perfect for me. But the butt was just too tight, and my husband confirmed that it looked weird from behind in addition to feeling weird. The entire point of these was to be comfortable. I accepted defeat and am sending them back.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Great - with caveat. Not for all body types",
                "reviewText": "For the most part these jeans are great. They\u2019re soft and stretchy and truly do look like typical jeans. However, not totally suitable for my body type. I\u2019m definitely a pear shape - high set/wide/flat rear end and carry my weight around my hips and lower abdomen with no real defined waist. These jeans are very comfortable but as someone who\u2019s short (5\u20193) and carries all my weight around my hips and lower abdomen I\u2019m used to wearing high waisted jeans so they don\u2019t gap or slide down in the back when sitting. These jeans don\u2019t offer that luxury. Even with the drawstring tightened (which is uncomfortable in order to avoid the gap) the jeans still slide down tremendously when sitting. Not all the way, but they definitely don\u2019t stay put. The front and everything else is great comfort wise but having to hike them up makes them look awful\u2026 I would like to see a high waist option for those of us who have this common problem.The size is true I\u2019m not sure about stretching out as I haven\u2019t worn them long but overall I\u2019ll continue to wear them. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re worth the price though, not when there are other options that offer more inclusive cuts - they\u2019re not \u201cspectacular\u201d by any means on my body type but they\u2019re great for what they are and pass off as real jeans easily. I just think the price is too steep and wish there was a high waist option. I can tell these are going to get slightly uncomfortable after a long wear because of the slipping in the back which causes pressure on the front and sides. Use your own judgement, but if you\u2019re built like I am; be aware and buy with a bit of caution.",

                "reviewText": "I was really excited about my two pairs of these at first. They were super comfortable and flattering. However, they stretch out a great deal, very quickly to the point that they are almost unwearable. That means they won't work for travel, as they were supposed to do. Other jeans can be worn many times without that happening. Very disappointed.",
