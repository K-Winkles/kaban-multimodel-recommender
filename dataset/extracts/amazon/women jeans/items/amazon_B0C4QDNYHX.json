                "reviewText": "UPDATE: Size 6 fit great. Could maybe even do a 4 but I carry my weight in my waist so I'm sticking with the 6. These have a true wide, baggyish leg so if you're looking for a slim leg, keep looking. I hung out on these on a weene afternoon and they were super comfy. The black and the grey are barely indistinguishable - the black is a washed black, and the grey is pretty dark. I took a pic along with some of my other grey jeans.Original review:These are made of a thicker but still quite stretchy denim. I'm 5'6\" 145-150 lbs and they're ankle length, hitting just a smidge above my ankle bones. The size 8 was a loose in the waist - I will probably return and reorder in a size 4 or 6 (probably 6) since they're likely to stretch out during the day. Waist is comfy though! The black is a washed black, not true black.",

That\u2019s how I discovered these jeans. I didn\u2019t expect much, but for the money I thought I\u2019d give it a try. This rivals wide leg jeans I\u2019ve spent $100 on. The fit is absolutely perfect. I\u2019m 57, 5\u20194\u201d, 135/40#. I\u2019m a size 4 snug and 6 loose. I also have a bit of a mom pooch and those buttons really give my stomach a flatter appearance. I purchased the 6 and it\u2019s a bit loose, which is perfect for my comfort. There\u2019s definitely stretch and it\u2019ll probably stretch a bit more as I wear them but that\u2019s OK. Super flattering, so comfortable. Score! I\u2019m certain I\u2019ll buy other colors.",

                "reviewText": "These cropped wide leg jeans are so soft and comfortable. They fit me like they were tailored for me. For reference I am 5\u2019 2\u201d. Weight 136. I ordered size 10. I was concerned they might be too small or tight but they are sooo stretchy. I can breathe and might actually eat food while wearing these and not feel my blood circulation has been cut off! I haven\u2019t worn them out yet so I can\u2019t say. The buttons are secure and button up perfectly. They are not cropped on me because I am short, but if I wanted to I could have them taken up to fit me as cropped and keeping the original hem, of course, tailors can do that (it\u2019s called European hemming). They hit perfectly at my ankle, not too long, not short, and my shoes show. But it\u2019s the softness and comfort level that has impressed me. They hug me, but are not tight in any way. The only issue was out of the package the denim had a strong chemical smell \u2014 it could be the dye \u2014 and I could smell it all through the house. So I hung them outdoors in the bright direct sunlight to let the sun kill the odour. It lessened the odour but didn\u2019t get rid of it entirely and I was surprised because direct sunlight always freshens clothes (and old vintage suitcases!) I put them in the washing machine through a regular cold water wash (so they don\u2019t shrink!!) with powdered soap, and one washing did the trick. No more smell. I can wear them. I can have them in the house. They didn\u2019t fade in the wash, as far as I can see. I did NOT put them in the dryer for fear of shrinkage. I hung them to dry and they still fit perfectly. I can\u2019t say how much they will \u201cbloom\u201d if at all, but since they are so stretchy I think they might bloom a little, but hopefully not become baggy at the seat or the knees. The colour is an usual blue that I think is very beautiful. I recommend!",
