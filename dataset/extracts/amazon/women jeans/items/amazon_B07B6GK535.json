As long as they are available on Amazon, these will be my go-to jeans. They fit great and are very comfortable. And the price is right. The stretch denim is perfect for the days I go bowling. I like them because they are fit like a glove from the knee up, and they are the perfect width at the calf/ankle area (not too skinny but not wide either).",

I'm also short but have thick thighs and a big butt so it's very hard for me to find anything that fits, it's either too long and loose, or just the right length but won't go over my bottom. These jeans took a minute to get over my bottom but once they were on they were so comfortable! They are flattering, the perfect length (I love that they offer \"short\" ), and the material is really nice. I am looking at the other colors because I want more pairs! I just purchased the black pair to wear since I'm back at work now and need to actually dress up. These look so well paired with my blazers and heels! I haven't washed them yet, I hope they don't fade but if they do, I'll update my review. So far, it's definitely worth the purchase!",
