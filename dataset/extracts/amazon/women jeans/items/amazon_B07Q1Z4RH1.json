                "reviewText": "I am a huge fan of these jeans - they are the only ones I buy. I initially purchased them when I was taking care of my mother while she was ill. I was in Florida for the entire summer and lost about 15 lbs. during the process. I live in Mass. near Boston and didn't know anyone down there except my parents. When I had a little free time I would walk in the park near their home. I had to buy some new clothes as most of the ones I brought with me were too large, so I got these at a local shop. They are really comfortable, the fabric is very soft, they come in a nice selection of colors and the waist is a bit stretchy for those days when your belly just won't cooperate. I also like the fact that they come in 3 lengths - regular, tall and short. I always had to hem my jeans as I'm only 5'1\" tall. The short length is just perfect for me - I don't need to alter them at all. They last a long time, even with frequent washings and fade just a little bit. I don't need to buy any jeans other than these. I like the fact that Amazon has a large selection of sizes and colors to choose from and they usually arrive very quickly and are less expensive than my local clothing store. I highly recommend them.Linneaann",

Ordered another and they are so much shorter... will try to return and cross my fingers but that's a big difference in length - quality control must be on vacation. Plus- these were $20 more than what I gott he other pair for... way more than inflation - someone must be price gouging. This style has extra space in the thigh area which works for me but if you're looking for skinny jeans - these are not for you. Good luck!!",

                "reviewText": "Very satisfied with these jeans. They are not extremely loose (as in baggy) but they fit without hugging the hips and legs. The waist was a little too big with about a 2 inch gap but a belt took care of it. Just the right length without dragging on the ground at the heels (I am 5'3\"). Previous reviewers noticed that the material is not a typical jean-like material. I agree, the material is thinner. Not an issue for me, but they are not meant to be just like Levi's and that may be an issue for some. I would buy these again, they are that comfortable.",

                "reviewText": "I normally wear a 12 in Lee jeans, but these seem to run large so I ordered a size 10, which fit much better. Front pocket depth is extremely important to me and these are quite good (Authentic Nile color -- different colors seem to use different patterns even though they are allegedly the same style jean....I know, it's crazy).The *big* annoyance is, not only was the fabric content different from the description (98% Cotton, 2% Spandex), they differ between the two *sizes*. I'm not a fan of polyester -- 92% cotton in the size 12 felt okay, but 84% cotton in the 10 was very stretchy and had that sticky feel. I hate to have to return both but I don't like either one. So disappointing!!!Update: I ordered the Authentic Nile color in November 2019. The cotton content is 92% with 7% polyester and 1% spandex. I think I'm getting used to the feel of lower-cotton fabric. The pocket depth is darned good: it will hold my 6.5\" phone securely with room to spare. I think I'll be stocking up on these.",
