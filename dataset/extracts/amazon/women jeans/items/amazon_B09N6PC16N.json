                "reviewText": "Highly advise to NOT buy these jeans . I am normally a size 7-9 so I ordered an XL based on the size chart. The fit with plenty of room but there are so many issues. For starters, the pockets upfront pop out and make it looks like the pants don\u2019t fit. Even if you attempt to hide them, it does no good, they just do it again. The second day I wore them the third button popped off because the hole for it was cut too large . Like not even when I\u2019m sitting down , I would just be standing there and clink , there it goes again rolling on the ground . They are not what I\u2019d call high wasted at all , barely to the naval . Plus they are not at all the color shown in the picture, which is really the least frustrating thing, but worth knowing . Just overall bad quality and definitely not for $36. Hope this helps so you don\u2019t make the same mistake I did.",

My only issue is there are a lot of buttons and it can be a little inconvenient to undo and redo them. Another issue I have is, as someone with rather short legs, I feel these were made with someone with longer legs in mind so they kinda bunch a little at the ankle. Other than that, very comfortable and easy to walk in.On another note, not sure if it\u2019s an issue of the supplier or Amazon, the pants were delivered in a clear plastic package so if you want to get these as a surprise gift for someone who lives with you, get to it first I guess?",

I ordered a medium and they were too loose for what I wanted so I returned them and then ordered a small hoping they would fit more snug the way a tight fitting jean should. I didn't get much lift from the butt, the waist still felt too large and frumpy and the length from the bottom of the buttons to the top was too long and bunched in the crotch area. I have a short waist at 5'2\" so maybe for a longer waisted torso, these jeans would fit as expected. I had to return these jeans.",
