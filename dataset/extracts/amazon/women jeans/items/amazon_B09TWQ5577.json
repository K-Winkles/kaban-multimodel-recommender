                "reviewText": "**I didn't buy these to work in, I bought them just cause I liked the look of them. I have no idea how they will stand up to a long day's work**So, like everyone else has said they do run small. I'm talking, I'm-usually-a-3-and-I-own-7s-and-9s-in-these-jeans small. The only reason I said they fit as expected is that I knew they were going to run small, so I sized up to accommodate that. But, when the size is right, the fit is amazing. I ended up buying the white ones in a 9, unsure of what the sizing would be and with the intent of dying them a light beige or brown. When they came I ended up loving the white, gave them a cute little raw-hemmed crop, and dressed them up. They're so comfortable but also sturdy; I have endometriosis and HATE having things too tight on my belly, and I approve of these pants. After the 9s came, I decided to order both the rinsed color and another white pair, both in 7s. I like the look of looser denim, and the 9s are so so comfy, but when I tried them on I knew the cut of these was going to be perfect for that mom-jean look. The 7s are so flattering on my butt! They feel like they were tailored to fit. I ended up bleaching the rinsed ones and dying the white ones beige. Just ordered another pair to dye black and I think my collection will be complete!! 11/10 recommend.For size reference, I'm 5'9, 145 pounds, typically a 26 in Levi's 501s.",

I\u2019m 5\u201910 with a 25\u201d waist and 36\u201d hips and the 3 was great, 5 was definitely too big. I\u2019m stoked to find pants that fit in the waist and aren\u2019t too tight in the legs!The bottom pant leg is a liiiittle wider than I prefer (was hoping for more like a Levi\u2019s slim-straight without the horrible Levi\u2019s washes), but overall they are very well constructed and I like them.One more thing - these are not super high waisted like a lot of the high waisted stuff you see these days, but they are above midrise",

I\u2019d say fit is pretty spot on for town jeans almost loose over the thigh and nice shaped fit over the hips and actually a waist band that sits right for a change.I\u2019d recommend following the majority and size up two sizes if u are actually working outdoors in them though the thigh is pretty roomy then. I\u2019m trying the stretch version next which the website calculator recommends in a 5x30",
