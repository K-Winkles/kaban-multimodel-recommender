I also have big thighs and they\u2019re not too tight which is incredible rare for me! They\u2019re a little pricey, but totally worth it!",

These are a rigid denim, which means NO stretch, they are true to size,so if you're normally a 30, but wear a 28 in stretchy jeans...order the 30. I'm 4'11\" and around 115 and the 24 fits like a glove!! There are no gaps at the waist, I love the cute little detail at the bottom of the leg, and your butt will never look better than in a pair of 501's!! These jeans are beautiful with adorable distressing and the 5 button fly I've come to love in a pair of Levi's jeans. I had these in my cart ans caught them for $20 on sale and wish I had ordered a few more. These are a great fit with a straight leg, Snug through the hips and thighs. You're going to love these jeans!!",
