I am 5'2\" and the length is absolutely perfect for me. The fabric is a dark wash and looks like pure denim. They do, however, have a nice stretch and are a perfect fit in the high rise. I think I could have worn a size 8 short, but purchased a 10 short just to be safe. I can always use a belt if necessary. Not a mom jeans look at all. Very nice!",

I work in an industrial dirty factory, and these are my 1 and only jeans to wear! They are VERY reasonably priced and last a long time!! I have bought many pairs of Bandolino jeans and pants over the years. I\u2019ve always had people ask me what kind of pants i wear, cause they always tell me they look nice!This brand of jeans and pants have been around a long time, just like me!",
