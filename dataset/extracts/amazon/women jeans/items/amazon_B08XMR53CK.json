I'm working on trying to remove the metallic smell, but I don't have a fool-proof way to do that. We'll see - just know that if you order the black ones, they have a VERY strong dye smell! But they fit great! I got a medium. I'm 5'2\" so they are a bit long, but nothing I don't deal with when I buy any pair of jeans.",
