                "reviewText": "I usually have low expectations for clothes bought on line, but as soon as I put these on I was amazed - they might be the most comfortable jeans I've ever worn. The quality is great and I feel like a good deal for the price. My only quibble is that I have short legs so although they fit great in the waist, they really don't fit like capris on me. Actually if I just tug them down a bit they just look like regular jeans. I can accept that - all my regular jeans are too long so if I think of these as regular jeans, they work just great. I'll keep thinking about how to get capris - I don't know if my sewing skills are up to hemming these up. But if you can usually fit \"regular\" sizes and don't need \"petite\", these jeans are fantastic and I love them.",
