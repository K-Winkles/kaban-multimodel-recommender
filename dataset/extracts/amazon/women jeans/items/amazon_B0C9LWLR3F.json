Make them even longer and create a streamlined silhouette. Check out our style suggestions: 1. Wear flared pants with heels. Combine the pants with beautiful heels. Next to the leg-lengthen effect, you also will create a chic feel. Bring the 70\u2019s back into your outfit with block-heeled ankle boots. Combine with pointed pumps for a business look. 2. Wear a top into your pants. Wear a slouchy top nonchalant into your flared pants. For a cool laidback vibe and accentuate your feminine silhouette. Complement with an eye-catching belt. 3. Style the pants with classic pieces. Create a classic look and combine the flared pants with a simple basic top. Complement the look with a tonal blazer and create on-duty appeal. 4. Create a high-fashion seventies look. Opt for a seventies revival and choose high-rise flared pants. Wear the pants with a loose-fitted shirt with trumpet sleeves or pair with a turtleneck pullover. Combine the look with chunky block-heeled ankle boots. Complement this fall with chunky knits; for example an oversized cardigan or a poncho-scarf.",

I just think they\u2019re more flattering and allow a longer line on your body. Second, get them tailored to work with your preferred shoes. You want them to just kiss the ground. No higher, but can definitely go longer and have them puddle a bit. And lastly, balance. If your pant leg is super wide, keep things more tailored and fitted up top. It\u2019ll be less overwhelming on your body and be much more flattering.",

Cute buttons to secure. Flattering cut and the stretch makes them feel more relaxed for any setting.I hadn\u2019t noticed the pattern before purchasing, but it works with the color I got just fine. I wouldn\u2019t likely purchase it again, as it goes into almost a stone washy design at the flares of each leg, but it\u2019s cute and unique.Overall, highly recommend and especially for the price! Well worth it. Buy the jeans for yourself!",

I had to return 3 times!! Started with a 16, then 14, then 12, these are a 10!! The return process with UPS could NOT be easier and zero issues. I was never questioned. I am 5\u20193 174 pounds. The length is perfect, so hard to find any pants that don't have a few inches dragging on floor. they have stretch, they hug in all the right places. Plus just mad style, very cool. I have gotten so many compliments on them. Even the wear, the distressing makes it seem like i\u2019ve had these as my fav for years. I will be ordering more pairs ASAP! These are a MUST BUY! You will not regret!! I have tried probably 15 different brands, this is the ONLY pair I have loved top to bottom. Oh! And sooo soft and easy to move in. Photo with white top is how they looked after wearing them every day for a week! I know i know, gross, which is why I will be buying more pairs.",
