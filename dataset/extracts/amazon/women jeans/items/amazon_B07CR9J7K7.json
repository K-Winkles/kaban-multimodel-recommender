                "reviewText": "I was very excited to see a skinny cut jean for my plus size heiney that also came in a \"petite\" since I'm pretty short. I ordered 2 pairs in 2 different colors, \"exhibition\" and \"light foxy\" (the distressed finish). When they arrived, the darker pair fit a bit too small, but not necessarily uncomfortably so. They were very soft and allowed for great ease of movement, but had I worn them any length of time I would likely have developed the dreaded \"camel toe\" before long! However, the distressed pair were very tight and hard to put on, even though they were the same size and style. Was very disappointing and the reason I deducted 1 star. Reordering 1 size up and hoping they fit better.PS - Also, the image shown was very misleading, as these jeans only have back pockets. The front pockets are fake except for that tiny pocket too small for much! (The model is shown with her hand in her front pocket) I hate carrying a purse, so would have been nice to have a pocket for any change and my lip balm. Not worth deducting a star over though, and I'm still reordering knowing about the lack of proper pockets.Updated: I got the next size up after the first ones were too snug, and they fit wonderfully! They have plenty of room for my big booty, without that annoying waist gap those of us with smaller waists and big butts have to deal with on most jeans. The wide waist band holds great without squeezing uncomfortably or flipping/rolling thanks to the sturdy elastic band. They fit my curves perfectly and look great! I got the darker blue finish this time instead of the worn looking jeans, and they have pockets. The regular blue finish jeans do not, which is both odd and annoying since they're the same darned jeans in 2 different colors!! But, I am changing my original 4-star review to 5 stars, as these are hands-down the best jeans I have bought in years!!Will DEFINITELY be ordering more!",

                "reviewText": "I have finally found jeans that look and feel like jeans, without the waistband digging into my stomach. These are so comfortable and fit my stomach comfortably and still have nice and skinny legs. I am 5\u20195\u201d 230lbs and bought a 22W plus - if that helps anyone. I bought one pair to try and then immediately went and bought a second pair. I love the sizes available, the quality is great, I feel good in them and they are even more comfortable than leggings\u2026these are without a doubt my new favorite jeans! So comfortable!!",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s been quite a few years since I\u2019ve bought a new pair of jeans. My life in retirement has allowed me to live in leggings and jagging. I wanted a pair of real jeans for the winter. It\u2019s difficult with Plus Size jeans, and after much consideration and reading through reviews, I chose this pair.I am very happy with this purchase. The fabric is high-quality denim. It\u2019s quite stretchy and very comfortable. This is my first time with this brand and I am very impressed with the overall quality and fit. I ordered utilizing the size chart and they fit true to size, I can\u2019t wait to see how much more comfortable. They are after more cycles of washing.Hi, definitely recommend these, and will strongly consider ordering more.",

                "reviewText": "What I really like about these jeans is there is no need for a belt. When I wear t-shirts and jeans with a zipper, I have to hope the shirt is big enough to cover my ample belly. Then I have to use a tightly cinched belt to keep them up because my jeans are stretchy, which leads to muffin tops and that's no way to live.But these are great. You simply pull them on and no zippers, no belts, no angry welts across my waist. I am so happy I found these and wish I had tried them sooner. Don't hesitate to purchase them if you like to wear jeans a lot and especially if you have a little extra weight because they are flattering.One thing: be very sure to get pull-on jeans with working front pockets. I ordered some without the pockets and it was very frustrating. All of them have back pockets but only a few retailers offer the jeans with front pockets.",
