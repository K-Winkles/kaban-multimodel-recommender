The pockets are a little less deep then the other dickies bootcut jeans I have gotten, but still significantly deeper than most women\u2019s jeans. I only buy Dickies jeans now because the front pockets are actually useable. The only thing is the belt loops are a little small. This might not be a problem with most belts, but mine is just big enough to make it hard to put through the loops. It fits, but\u2019s it\u2019s pretty tight. I got these in dark blue and lighter blue. I like that the dark blue doesn\u2019t have a lot of fading like most jeans. They seem like good quality and will hopefully last a long time. I would buy again.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Initial Impressions",
                "reviewText": "I'm 5'2\" (157.28cm) and 158~ lbs (71.5kg)Ordered the black pair in the size 8, tag on jean says 8/29.Purchased these to wear to work, 10hr shift in fab & assembly.First Impressions: Stretch is good, thicker fabric kinda scratchy Legs actually look longer with the bootcut, does the curves justice. Solid shade of black. No back gap, might need belt.Fit : 4/5 Fit my legs and especially my thighs and butt (the biggest part of my body) comfortably but is a little looser one my waist/stomach. I could go down a full 2 inches on the waistline but nothing a belt won't help with. The waistline sits right at my bellybutton (35\" (89cm) to the floor) and doesn't ride too far down when I bend or squat, I have full coverage.I don't know if going down a size would be the right move for me just because I want them to be comfortable while I'm working and if they're too snug will hamper my range of movement.Length : 4/5 They are a little long, would go with a petite size if possible, but they will be worn with boots so it's not an issue. If you don't mind the hems dragging a bit or some hemming work like me then you'll be fine. Work pants are ment to get dirty.Fabric : 3/5 Seems like a sturdy denim. A bit scratchy but that'll be fixed with an initial wash. They do have a little stretch so if you are in between sizes then you're safe to go on the lower end. Seams are solid and the fabric is thicker than regular fashion jeans. Haven't put it through a workday yet but they seem like they'll hold up.Pockets : 2/5 Better than most jeans but could be bigger. When it comes to pockets size matters. At 16cm deep, just barely over 6\", there's room for improvement where there isn't for my phone, keys, wallet, chapstick, and work fob. Can't carry a purse around the warehouse, ya feel?Price : 1.5/5 I personally don't like spending more than $20-$25 on a pair of pants but I need something sturdy and that fits over my boots. I bought these on a 20% off sale for $40 instead of $50 which is the only reason I considered these. Honestly just feels like I'm paying for the brand and not the pants at this point.I did order a pair of Wranglers that were on sale for $30 (29% off $42) that'll be here in a day or two. Depending on how well that pair fits I may return the Dickies and get another pair of W's (or 2, for that price).All that being said, I have not actually worn these to work so if I decide to keep them and they hold up for a long while then maybe they're worth it. For a $50 pair of jeans they at least better last me 3-5 years.",

Wasn\u2019t expecting that.The zipper is very hard to work, it does not moved smoothly at all. I tried candle wax, but hasn\u2019t helped much.The waist is too low. I an not high waisted, but these make me feel that my pants are always falling down. I will have to wear a belt with them, not happy about that. Unfortunately all jeans lately fit like that. You can\u2019t find boot cut with a normal height waist. To get a regular waist you have to buy jeans that are narrow at the ankle, not what I wanted.The fabric is very nice, the stretch is very comfortable.",
