Other reviews posted wrote the same thing and they are NOT wrong! I washed them as soon as I got them, hoping the length would shrink a little bit, but it didn't happen, so now I'm going to have to take them to a tailor to have them hemmed up. They are extremely comfortable, nice color, fit through hips and thighs is great, and after they are hemmed up I'm sure I will wear them a lot.",

I\u2019m a 24/26 and I ended up ordering them in a 26 and they\u2019re almost too big for me.
