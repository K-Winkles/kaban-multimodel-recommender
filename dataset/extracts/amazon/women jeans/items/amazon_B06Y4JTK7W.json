The top of the jeans hit at the top of my belly button and the best part, other than no more muffin top, is that I don't have to keep pulling them up! I hang dry my jeans, so I can't comment on shrinkage as I haven't experienced that. They seem to fit true to size. I would definitely recommend them. Update: I ordered a second pair in the same size and they are clearly marked size 6, but are too small.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Sort-of an ok replacement for my KMart Basic Editions womens short jeans",
                "reviewText": "I have been wearing KMart Basic Editions womens short (not petite) jeans forEVER. I liked that they were on the less thick/heavy side and had a stretch without becoming over-stretched. I especially liked that they sat just below the belly button in the front but sat high enough up in the back that they were almost at the waist and didn't slide down my butt when I knelt or bent over. I found that they wore fairly well and washed well (I've worn them to do yard work and gotten them really dirty). I have been every size from 18 down to 6 (and up and down again and again) and still have been able to get my size in SHORT length. I especially liked that I could get them at regular price for under $20, sometimes on sale from $10-13. Unfortunately, they seem to be going the way of the dinosaur and so I've been forced to search for a replacement. I have been having a really hard time because I want a thinner material, in SHORT, sitting just at the waist (not mid-rise), straight but not tight, with some stretch, and with good-sized pockets, and a price that is reasonable. I can't wear Gloria Vanderbilt (they're just too tightly cut in every size); I find Dickies too \"industrial\"-looking and the material too heavy; in many store brands the material is too heavy or not stretchy enough and most don't come in short in a cut I like.Add to all this that I've been trying to buy online because I need jeans and the pandemic has resulted in a lot of store closures.I read a lot of reviews for many brands and finally settled on trying Lee.I am currently a size 6 (at the large end of the size range), but depending on cut and stretch could be an 8; short (not petite) length (29 inch inseam). I am 5'2\", 132 lbs (but this fluctuates upward) and carry weight a little bit more at my waist and hips.I was on the fence as to whether to give the Lee jeans 3 or 4 stars, but since I just ordered a second pair I think it's only fair to give 4 stars. With that said, they are the best replacement that I've found so far for my KMart jeans, but they are by no means comparable. Here's why: 1. The waist band is fairly thick and it bunches at the button when I sit down, sticking me in the belly button and giving me the dreaded sweaty waist. 2. The jeans material itself has some stretch (not so much in the waist) but the material is a heavier weight than the KMart jeans--perhaps more of a mid-weight material. For some this might be a plus but on a hot (80 degree), humid, sunny day, the Lee's are definitely hard to wear comfortably, whereas I had no issue with my old KMart jeans. 3. Some reviewers commented on the minniscule front pockets and they weren't kidding. If I still had my old flip phone I would have to turn it sideways to get it in; it won't fit an iPhone. The front pocket needs a reality check and a redesign. But given my limited jeans options, I put up with it. 4. Others would consider $23 or so reasonably priced, but for jeans that I am going to beat up (gardening, cleaning the house, getting bleach and stains on them, etc.) I really want to have a good chance of paying under $20 and I couldn't get there (I had to hunt around to find them for $23-ish).Now for the good points: 1. They do not ride down my butt in the back (the way mid-rise jeans with stretch do on me), but instead stay firmly at my waist. This is the first pair of jeans out of the ones bought in my replacement \"quest\" that stayed put. 2. They have a small amount of stretch but did not stretch out in the washer and dryer (hot and hot settings). 3. They come in SHORT (petite is the wrong cut for me).When the stores reopen I will give up the on-line search in favor of trying on jeans in the stores, but for now these Lees are as close as I can get to my old Basic Editions jeans--sort-of.I hope this review helps anyone else hunting for replacement jeans.",
