                "reviewText": "I love these jeans. They are jeans, but have that snug curve hugging fit of jeggings. They are true to size (if you normally wear Levis) I'm 5'1, 125lbs, and I'm straight up and down as far as my hips and below go. These were not baggy around the butt or thighs like most jeans are for me. VERY form fitting, even at the ankles, so perfect to wear with boots and not worry about bunching.I bought two sizes- a 5 and 7. The 7 I bought for when I want to tuck shirts in. I got them in black, and they are actually black.They are high rise and will suck the tummy in, so anyone who wants that, these will be great.I like the high rise not because of the tummy factor, but because the top curves in and as a result it makes me look like I have some sort of a butt/hourglass (I have the smallest butt in the world despite doing squats). The only curves I have are my chest, and straight down from there, so I just end up looking top heavy and with no shape. These jeans give me that shape.I got the regular fit, and they are the perfect length and isn't bunching up a bunch at the bottom, which is normally a problem because I'm so short.I'm 30, and a mom. I find these to be perfect for sexy mom jeans, but I could imagine younger people would like them, also.A side note-my sister is the opposite build of me. She's flat up top, but has a booty, but we are the same height/weight and waist size. She just has a bubble butt. She tried on the size 7 pair I bought, and they seem to be great for women that also have curves and need something that'll hug them.Women with flat butts (like me) and with booties (like my sister) can both flaunt these jeans equally. I attribute it to the jegging type material, which I didn't think I would like at all.Don't let the jegging type material scare you-they are sturdy, didn't get stretch marks when my sister with a booty snuck my pair all day, they stay put and for once I didn't have to wear a belt.I will be buying more in other colors.",

                "reviewText": "After reading several reviews about the fit of these jeans, I'm very glad I sized up. I normally wear an 8 in women's pants and ordered an 11 here. They were even still a little snug around my tummy until maybe the 4th day wearing them. The stretch in the waist and butt area is pretty good, the stretch in the calves is minimal and not jegging-like (a problem if you have thick calves like me). I do like the ultra high rise, the dark wash that seems like it will last and the overall quality of these jeans. I feel like I'll have them for a long time.",
