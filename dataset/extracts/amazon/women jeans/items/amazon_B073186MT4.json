These cover my shoe mostly but don\u2019t drag the ground - stopping an inch above a shoe with average tread on the bottom. They fit well and are flattering. They are thinner jeans, but not cheap feeling. My other \u201cfavorite\u201d types of jeans are Democracy Ab-solution jeans and Ariat jeans. Democracy are hit and miss on whether the length is long enough for me. Sometimes yes, and sometimes\u2026look out for the flood. I love Ariat jeans, but they are thicker and more substantial and less forgiving. In other words - they\u2019re great for wearing \u201cout,\u201d but not if you plan to eat a big meal. I feel like I can both wear these new jeans out AND eat the big meal.",

I ordered the long thinking the regular would be too short because this has happened in the past, but I think I would have been fine with regular. The long is long! I intend on wearing them for horseback riding, so I think with my boots they'll be fine. They are also very flattering with the cute design on the back pockets. The jean material is light weight and goes great with a bodysuit too! I also ordered a second pair in a size 7 once i received these and they fit perfect!",

                "reviewText": "REVIEW OF THIRD ORDER: I got my third pair yesterday (Magic) and they are a perfect fit! I was smart enough to not get the long ones this time so the length is great. It is also the perfect fit in the legs and hips. I love the fit when these are made the correct size so I'm very happy that this pair came just like I wanted. When the two pairs I purchased wear out I'm coming back for more!REVIEW OF SECOND ORDER: My first order was for 3 long in Albury and although I did not need a long, the sizing was perfect. I loved them so much I ordered a 3 in Pure Betsy and I got them yesterday. They were so large I could have fit myself in them twice! (Seriously, I had them buttoned and I could fit my arms into them with my legs and I still had room left over!) I REALLY liked the first pair so I am going to try again when my size comes back in stock in another color I like. (Fingers crossed this pair fits!) But on a positive note I am able to do free returns so I'm only out my time.REVIEW OF FIRST PURCHASE: I recently got some boots that don\u2019t look good with skinny jeans so I wanted to get a couple pair of bootcut jeans. I haven\u2019t owned any for awhile but I always remembered them being too short so I ordered long. I\u2019m 5\u20195\u201d so that was a huge mistake but luckily for me I sew so I plan on hemming them up. I really love the fit and they look great on! I plan on ordering other shades (in regular length) because I like these so much! I hate shopping and wasn\u2019t sure what size I would be so I was worried to order online. I only have old navy jeans.. some are tight, some are big and they\u2019re all size 2. So I went with a 3, which is what I wore years ago and they fit great! Not too tight but still fitted in the but and thighs. The fabric isn\u2019t super thick but it doesn\u2019t feel cheap and thin. The color is exactly like the picture too. Great jeans at an affordable price for sure!",

                "reviewText": "I am 5\"7 and 156 lbs. My build is slim but muscular. I ordered the 7 long of the Betsy jeans. The color, design, and the feeling of the jeans is awesome. However, the jeans do have quite a bit of stretch. The 7 long is too large for me around the waist, thighs, and buttocks right out of the packaging. With normal wear and washing, the jeans will become even larger looking on me.Luckily, this company has a great return/exchange policy. They have shipped me out a smaller size and are giving me 30 days to ship back the larger size. It is nice that I do not have to return and wait for the refund of the current pair, prior to getting a smaller pair shipped out to me. I will write a review for the new pair once I receive them next week.I ordered a second pair of these jeans, the Chrystie Pure, and they are AWESOME! These jeans are made extremely well, they fit great, and the designs are very trendy. The website pictures DO NOT do justice. The jeans look MUCH better in person and on, than what the website shows. Highly recommend.",
