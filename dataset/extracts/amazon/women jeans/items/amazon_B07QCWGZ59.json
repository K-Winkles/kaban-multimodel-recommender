Aside from this miracle-making detail, these bootcut jeans come with a mid-rise waistband that rests slightly below the waist, a slim fit that doesn\u2019t lose its shape, and a longer leg with a bootcut opening.",

The flare is just enough to be fashionable, and it fits my ridiculous hips/waist ratio (44 hips 31 waist) without pinching my thighs, flattening my butt, giving the horrible gap in the back of the waist or trying to cut me in half when I sit down. Great stretch and soft material while also being durable. I wish there were more colors. I honestly might just buy a few more pairs and dye them. Worth every penny.",

The others are \u2018fine\u2019 but not quite enough stretch, and a little too long\u2026tight in the thighs but baggy elsewhere. I ordered these that came today to try because wow what a great price\u2026and they are awesome! Perfect amount of stretch, hold everything in without being uncomfortable and fit like a glove in all the places. Love the length and amount of bootcut\u2026so can be worn with any shoe. Ordered the other color immediately after trying on. Highly recommend!",

Good fit but a bit too long. I am 5' tall I bought a size 4 petite. Had to hem them up about 1 3/4\". I only wore them once and havnt washed them yet so maybe that will keep them from stretching so much. Well made otherwise.",
