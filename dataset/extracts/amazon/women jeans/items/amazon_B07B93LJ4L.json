                "reviewText": "Caveat: I might think these jeans are extra amazing because I had to exchange for a smaller size. These are my first size 12 jeans in 15 years!Really, these jeans are truly excellent. Here's what I love about them:\u2705There's room for my hips, while cinching at my waist (no gapping!)\u2705And they're not tight at my waist, either\u2705They feel like denim, but have the stretch and comfort of that stretchy jegging material\u2705They fit great without clinging to my (ahem) chunky knees\u2705They're a little longer than most petite jeans which is awesome! So often my petite jeans end right at the top of my Chucks, when I'd like them to go just an inch longer. These jeans give me that inch. Huzzah!\u2705The price! *flails* My other favorite jeans are by Democracy which are at least twice as expensive.I hope you love them as much as I do!",

I\u2019m 4\u201911\u201d and weigh 115, with a slightly curvy figure. Decided to give these a try since they come in a petite size, come in the colors I was looking for, and thankfully aren\u2019t \u2018distressed\u2019. Have tried multiple brands, including some very high end premium brands, and all of them seem to be either too small in the hips/thighs, or too baggy with a really bizarre rise.I couldn\u2019t be happier with these jeans! The 4 petite fits perfectly, they\u2019re incredibly comfortable, and both the dark wash and the black are exactly right. I imagine the black will fade to a nice soft black after washing, which is my preference.Definitely a great value, and I expect I\u2019ll be replacing all of my jeans with these going forward.",
