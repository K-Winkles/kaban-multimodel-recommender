                "reviewText": "I bought these jeans in two sizes. One in my normal size (14) and one in my \u201cnew\u201d size (12). (I recently lost 40 pounds and am still adjusting to the in-between thing.) I should have gone with a 10 and a 12. They do tend to stretch out after the first few hours of wear. But they are SO comfortable. I am relatively short - just 5\u20195\u201d. The \u201cshort\u201d length is perfect length for boots and sneakers; short for sandals. The regular length is the perfect length to roll for the cuffed length with boots and high-top sneakers (I should have skipped the shorter length and just gotten the regular length. They sit a little higher on the waist, which I love (who\u2019s got time for that whole muffin top thing?) Super stretch, super soft, super curves. I also love the slim straight leg. Boot cut swallow up my entire foot. I\u2019m already short. When I lose my foot in my jeans, I look like I\u2019m in a hole. :) The straighter leg helps me look a little taller. I\u2019ll definitely be ordering more of these jeans. Great deal for the money.",

                "reviewText": "In pants, I have a very difficult to find size. I need a 0 long (at least 32\" inseam), preferably a slim fit as well since I dont have a lot of curve in the hip or thighs. I've generally bought levis in the past, but not only has their quality gone way done (now mostly spandex and very little denim), but I've also struggled even getting that size ordered directly from the store. These jeans are a really nice fit and the quality seems on par with current levis for 1/3 the price. My two notes on these are that they are high-waisted and the \"long\" inseam is just at 32\" (crossing my fingers these don't shrink in the wash).",
