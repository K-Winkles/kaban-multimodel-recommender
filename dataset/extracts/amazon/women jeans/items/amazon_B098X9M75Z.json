                "reviewText": "I actually found these jeans due to the style sharing my name, and I am so glad I did! Despite the issues I had with getting a size that fit, these have easily become my new favorite jeans. While I do wear the same size within other brands, I found sizing the most complicated here. I am a 31 so I went with a 32 initially after reading the reviews, but they were so tight I had to pray for a miracle to zip them and they weren't very flattering. Those were swiftly returned, but because I loved how nice they looked I decided to try with a 33. I have been a die-hard KanCan and Levi fan due to the high waist fit offered but notice that the pockets will stick out or there isn't much stretch to them. I'm a thick girl, so the little details are important when it comes to finding something flattering. These jeans check off all my boxes! They're high waisted, they have a good amount of stretch to them, and the pockets stay in place.Similar to BKE's control front jeans, the Bridgette style offers a good amount of smoothing without being advertised as control front, too which is a bonus!I will definitely be getting more jeans from Lucky Brand.",

                "reviewText": "Lucky brand jeans fit just the way you want your jeans to fit. No matter what type of jeans you want, Lucky brand has them. I\u2019m not a huge fan of skinny jeans but if you like them then purchase Lucky brand. I love the way they look with a nice top worn in or out, but when you want to remove them put aside a half hour of your time. Also you must be ultra flexible or have a friend handy. I\u2019ve tried other skinny jeans and they all have this problem. Putting them on is a dream but removing them takes muscles. They do look nice once they\u2019re on but remember some time in the near future you must take them off. Lucky brand jeans are worth it, though.",
