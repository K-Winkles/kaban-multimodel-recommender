I would classify them as business casual, not fancy, but they can be dressed up or down nicely. They are wrinkle resistant and the fabric has a fair amount of give, although I would not describe them as stretchy--but that's a plus in my opinion. They are light weight and comfortable year-round. I have them in black, dark blue, dark green and charcoal, and am happy with the colors. I have worn them with boots as well as casual slips-ons and sandals, and all worked well.",

                "reviewText": "I am 5'1\", 120 pounds, and have struggled forever to find pants that fit without needing any kind of alterations. Theye are either too long or the waist is too big if I get them to fit over my hips, or both. It's a nightmare and has made me hate shopping.I decided to give these a try and am panning to get them in every color! I bought the 4 short, and they are perfection! The material is nice enough for work but can also be casual, the length is just right, I wear a very small, heeled boot most of the time and these are perfect. The waist band has one of those thicker elastic bands built in that isn't too tight or too loose. It allows the little extra I need to slide over my hips without having that big gap in the back when pulled all the way up. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. 10 out of 10.",

I ordered size 10 & size 12 to try to find the right fit. I have ordered the below fabric combinations:-100% Polyester (size 12 fit best: comfortable & fit very well)-71% cotton, 26% polyester, 3% spandex (size 12 fit best: these are a bit stiff)-38% polyester, 38% rayon, 20% nylon, 4% spandex (size 10 fit best: These are baggy and have a lot of extra fabric in the thighs. These seem to run bigger than the other fabric combinations.)I prefer the pants that are 100% polyester, they just feel more comfortable. The pants that have cotton are my least favorite, they tend to be more stiff.",

Although some reviews claimed they fit small, I found them to be true to size. I hesitated ordering for quite a while due to the price, but they are worth it. They are well made, fit well and my original pair, now a year old, still look like new. I would definitely recommend these and plan to buy again.",
