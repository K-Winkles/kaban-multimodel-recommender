                "reviewText": "Levi's Women's Ribcage Bootcut Jeans have quickly become my go-to denim for a stylish and comfortable everyday look. These jeans effortlessly combine fashion-forward design with the timeless appeal of Levi's craftsmanship. First and foremost, the high-rise Ribcage design is a game-changer. It offers a flattering, waist-cinching fit that not only accentuates your curves but also provides comfort throughout the day. The bootcut leg adds a touch of vintage flair and works perfectly with various shoe styles, from sneakers to heels. The quality of the denim is exceptional. It's soft and slightly stretchy, making these jeans comfortable enough for all-day wear while retaining their shape beautifully. I appreciate the attention to detail, from the durable stitching to the well-placed pockets. What sets these jeans apart is their versatility. They're equally suitable for casual outings as they are for dressing up with a blouse and accessories for a more polished look. Levi's offers a range of washes to suit different preferences, and the Ribcage Bootcut style seamlessly complements a variety of outfits. Durability is another strong point. These jeans have held up impressively well after numerous wears and washes, maintaining their color and shape.There were a fantastic addition to any denim collection. They offer a flattering fit, quality craftsmanship, and versatility that make them a valuable wardrobe staple. Whether you're a denim aficionado or simply looking for a pair of jeans that combines style and comfort, these jeans won't disappoint. Levi's continues to set the standard for iconic denim, and the Ribcage Bootcut Jeans are a testament to that legacy!!",

                "reviewText": "When I tell you I'll never wear a different pair of jeans ever again, I mean it. I LOVE these jeans. I feel totally feral out walking around in these. My husband follows me around the house like a lovesick puppy when I wear them. They're comfortable, soft, cute, and have just enough of a bell flare to not be over the top. The fit is so flattering, lemme tell you. I AM 5'8\", weigh 185lbs and got the size 32, I wear a 12-14 in pants normally.Here are the PROS: Wrinkle resistant, soft but very sturdy denim, stretchy, and super high rise. I'm 5'8\" but my torso is long and no high waist pants are ever actually high waist on me. These really are, they sit above my belly button like they should, at the small of my waist. They're perfectly long enough to wear with my Dr. Martens and just barely brush the ground. I love the light wash. The fit makes me look taller and curvier than I am.CONS: They'll be both too high rise and too long if you're much shorter than 5'8\". I actually glued the bottom button of the button fly, to the denim that covers the buttons. The reason for this is it gaps a little? I don't need to undo the bottom button to put the jeans on or take them off, so I figured this was the best solution. I didn't like the gap/bulge that the extra fabric creates and gluing it down worked well.I hope this was helpful!",

However, as soon as I put them on, I didn\u2019t want to take them off. They are nice and stretchy which makes them extra comfortable but still gives tummy control. I frequently wear them to the Disney parks and they are comfortable enough to wear all day walking in the parks. They\u2019re so comfortable that even after a full day of eating around the world at Epcot and getting bloated On beer and snacks I don\u2019t mind them being on like many other types of jeans. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "These jeans are close to perfect, but not quite.They are CLEARLY made for tall people. I am 5' 7-1/2\" and I bought the size 32 which is a size 14 with a 34.2\" waist (why the company makes a size 32 with that waist is silly). I normally buy 12's but went with what the size chart says. They are a bit long in the inseam (by about 1\") and they're not kidding that they''re \"ribcage\" not waist height. They would fit people 5'8\" and taller VERY WELL. But they're way better than the gap-backed lowrise ones. These having such a high rise means they have to make them smaller at the waist which is what real women with hips need. We are not just a bigger size of the size 2 girls. We have hips that are bigger and waists that are smaller than our hips.I also don't love the buttons fly. But the fabric is a good mix of cotton and stretch, a bit thicker than the more stretch jeans (which I like) and all in all I'd rather have them a bit too tall in the rise than too short. I could have used 32\" inseam (I think these are 33\").I probably could have fit into a 10, but these fit very well (I'm 163lbs) not too looks, not too tight. I got these bc my thighs are a bit bigger than average.I kept them because they're pretty good.",

The pictures to be honest on Amazon were so so and didn\u2019t really match her hype and weren\u2019t over appealing to me. So I thought I\u2019d chance it and took the plunge to try them. Ok, now I know what all the hype was about! They are magnificent lol!! Fit and feel and flattering..just love them!!!!!",

                "reviewText": "I bought the black colour jeans. I am 5\u20197, 160lbs. I have two pairs of ribcage jeans in a size 30 from the Levi\u2019s store, and while I love the way they look they are not that comfortable (they have a girdle effect which is good for how they look and bad for eating a big meal). Decided to try these ones, but I was sceptical. I also bought these in a 31, for a more casual (and comfortable) fit. Anyway, they are pretty good. Way stretchier than the ones I have. Fit well on me (but I have had two kids and have no waist anymore) and look good. They are cheaper than the Levi\u2019s store ones and you can tell by the fabric, these are like the Costco version, but overall a good deal. For reference I wear a 29 at Madewell, and a 30 at the Gap.",
