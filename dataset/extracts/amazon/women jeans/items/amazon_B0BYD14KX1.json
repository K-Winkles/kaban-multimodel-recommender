The rips are different than pictured, The button already looks like it\u2019s going to fall off as soon as I took it out of the packaging. I\u2019m hesitant to even give 2 stars but I am because of the accurate size chart however family dollar sells jeans and I literally have a pair that was a fraction of the price and better quality. So I\u2019m not sure what the reason for the price it because it\u2019s definitely not quality. For reference I\u2019m 5\u20197 and 228 and I ordered the XL. I also feel like these jeans make my stomach look weird asf but I\u2019m trying to loose weight so if you have a mom pooch I would avoid these.",
