                "reviewText": "My information:I am 21, I am EXTREMELY TALL for a girl, I am 6'5\" (My family is a clan of giants :D) I am an average weight for my heigth, not too stick thin or too chubby.My true jean size ( after some casual research on how jeans are supposed to be sized) is 14, and that is what i usually wear. 11 in plus sizes, 17 in juniors. I think you get the idea.My physical inseam is 39 inches(crotch to floor), but I like an inseam of 37 inches on jeans.Shipping:Exactly on time. 5 stars!Packaging:A thick plastic shipping sack, standard for a lot of clothing orders on amazon.No shipping damage whatsoever 4 1/2 stars because I wish they used boxes instead of sacks, but oh well :DFit;I ordered a 13x36. The inseam is exact, while the waist band does indeed run large.I normally wear a 14/15, but these fit perfectly. I'm glad I took the advice of other reviewers.NOTE: I was a little nervous because they seemed very snug at first wearing (Of course I tried them on right away and they fit perfectly, but I washed and dryed before actually wearing them following tag directions exactly) The waist had shrunk an inch, but the inseam did not shrink at all.As I wore them they loosened back to a great comfy fit. I have washed them four times and there has been minimal shrinkage.They are not skinny jean tight, but they are slightly fitted to the leg before the boot flare. I can bend and squat in them without losing all circulation to my knees and ankles, which is AWESOME :DThree words: NO GAP WAISTBAND. It actually works! Say goodbye to the dreaded crack attack :)There is a lot of well-placed room in the rear, so slimmer ladies might not like this fit. I actually had some breathing room haha!4 stars, only because they run large and might annoy the slimmer ladies who need their jeans to be tight :DColor:I ordered Tuff Buck, it is pretty true to the pictures, I like the very subtle fading and faux wear. they are extremely light, but just enough so the jeans dont look brand-spanking freshly dyed. haha.5 stars!My opinion:I already have a pair, same size only different color Dark Dynasty. That pair has stood up to me running around working outside, walking a lot during shopping trips, and playing with crazy kindergartener boys in my sunday school class.I LOVE that they have long inseams for us amazons of the world!! While these are by no means the low-riding, painted on, bling encrusted things that seem to be flooding the market, they FIT.IMPORTANT: these are made for women who intend to RIDE HORSES OFTEN. they are by no means jeans to go clubbing in. They are meant for people who want their jeans to fit well and stay on.I LOVE LOVE LOVE these jeans, they work so well for my body shape, my lifestyle, and my wallet. Very good value for an extremely high-quality pair of jeans.I'd say that's a good piece more than 20 words :D",

I was just hoping for a little more room in the calves.I ordered a size 7, 30 inch length, 147#s and 5'5\" in height, and they are perfect for me. It is just that I have larger calves,.....Bonus was the material did not have that funky, chemical smell that many denims do, you know , that smell that NEVER washes out. I hate sending/taking jeans back because of that insecticide or whatever smell.",

                "reviewText": "I own several pairs of Q babies. For me, they are the best fitting jean on the market. I do ride and I have worn Wrangler products my entire life. I'm 5-6 around 142 and wear a 34 inseam in regular ladies' business suits, so a 36\" inseam for riding is a must. I've found they run a little big, as I have both 3/4 and 5/6 in Q babies in general. I do like them to fit snugly but not tight in the butt and thigh. This particular review is specifically for the Black pair I've purchased from Amazon. I went with the 5/6. The black is WAY stretchier than any of the various colors of indigo/blue/stone wash that I have. If I was to get another pair, I'd definitely get the 3/4. The material is also softer and accepts lint way easier than the blue ones. This is a common problem with black jeans I've found, but I don't know why. I had these delivered to a horse show and wore them right away, but they are headed to laundry for starching. If I lose 5 lb, I'll probably have to get the smaller size. If you're waffling on the size for the black ones, go smaller. They are soft and they do stretch.",

It ain\u2019t the same, and the fit of this pair was slightly off from the start. These are my go-to jeans, and I am mad. I looked at trying to patch them, but I don\u2019t see a good way, and I don\u2019t trust them at all. I\u2019m going to tell Wrangler, too, and see if they send B-goods to Amazon.
