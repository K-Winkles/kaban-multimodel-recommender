I have thick thighs so I need a wider leg to have the appearance of \u201cstraight leg\u201d jeans, and these are perfect. These are made of a nice stretchy fabric, too. Not jegging material, but softer than typical jeans. Every time I wear these I get compliments about how cute and/comfy they look. The only negative I have is that one of pairs I have has a small string that wasn\u2019t trimmed, but I cut that on my own it\u2019s perfectly fine. Additionally, these can shrink so be careful to wash accordingly (no need to order a size up). If you\u2019re trying to find a pair of life-changing jeans just buy them! You won\u2019t regret it!*Note: the white jeans are see through, but the other pairs are not",

I wish the front rise was about 1/2\u201d lower- maybe even an inch. The front wants to kind of sag down anyway about that much because it\u2019s a little too high (at least for my body).The bad is that the left pocket in front won\u2019t stay tucked in. After looking at it closely on the inside, I can see the fabric is twisted and doesn\u2019t lay flat.I\u2019m not sure if I can return these. I\u2019d like to try again with another pair. But also nervous they\u2019ll also have issues with quality.",

The material isn't stretchy, so be sure to measure your waist and go by the size chart. I got a Small and it fit nicely around my waist and hips with a little extra room for my food baby.

This baggy pant is long enough and not too frumpy for my size. I love them!",
