                "reviewText": "Well designed, solidly executed pair of blue jeans! Not boxy, but gracefully shaped with a close-fitting, high, relatively slender waist. The hips accommodate without ballooning and there's room for healthy-sized thighs and butt to feel right at home. The waist sits perfectly over the navel. Yesssss!All the standard features you expect in a classic jean are here: the pants close with a reinforced button closure over a metal button embossed with the Lee logo; there are metal rivets on the front pockets with an extra mini patch pocket just below the waistband on the right hand side; adorning the back waistband on the right hand side -- a soft leather patch sporting the Lee logo; and neatly embroidered \"X's\" that securely fasten the top outer edges of each back pocket to the seat of the pants. Back pocket stitchery consists of a simple but elegant double wave design. Fabric is 99% cotton, 1% elastane. Jeans are manufactured in Egypt, a country that produces some of the best cotton in the world. Denim is medium weight, smooth and soft, with no nasty-smelling chemical finish. I was so impressed with this purchase, I just ordered three more pairs! Knockout buy. Many thanks to Amazon for offering these in a variety of colors and at a reasonable price.",

But seriously, there's nothing frumpy or dowdy (both of those are Mom adjectives, aren't they?) about the cut and fit. The pockets are real usable pockets, unlike the shallow, useless pockets we so often get in women's clothing. I love the Washed Black color. It will go with just about everything.",

At first 12 fit pretty well, comfortable, just loose enough but not sloppy or baggy. However after just one wear, they stretched out too much and are not as flattering as I would like them to be. I should have sized down at least to a 10.As far as the quality - these jeans are well made, no complaints.I feel like the color is somewhat different in person, definitely has a \u201cvintage\u201d look to it. Not a deal breaker just a matter of personal preference.Bottom line - if it wasn\u2019t for the sizing, these jeans could have been a good find.",

It is when your waist is smaller than your butt and thighs, mine is 2 inches smaller than most pants that fit on my butt and thighs. I\u2019ve included pictures so you can see how wonderfully they fit all around. They fit so great that I bought another pair. The only thing I would say is I\u2019m 5 feet five and I had to go with the long size. The regular, which I also kept hits me just a little shorter than I like. But it looks cute with a pair of canvas, tennis shoes. I\u2019m 160 pounds and size 12.",

                "reviewText": "I am in my late forties, a mom, who is dealing with some weight gain due to perimenapause. I have large hips with shorter legs. This cut is very comfortable and figure flattening for me. It doesn't cling to my legs like skinnies do, but the high rise and tapered design fits my physique just right. I have tried the relaxed and the skinny cuts this year but this one feels and looks like ME. I will purchase them again in another shade.",
