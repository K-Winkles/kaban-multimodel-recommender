The 14 was too tight on my hips.Pro: color is easy to match my clothes, it's loose, loose around my calves which is great for my blood circulation when standing all day at work, although this is meant for mid waisted( I usually wear it under my tummy because of health problems) ( sometimes I wear it mid waisted so my waist look snatched)Can be improved: wish it was a bit shorter because without shoes, I'm cleaning the floor for free",

                "reviewText": "I purchased these in a size 12 in the color Home Laundered. For sizing reference, I'm usually a medium-large or a 8-12/29-31 in bottoms and jeans. If it helps, I wear a size 6 or 8 in Lulu leggings. I'm 5'3\" tall with a short torso, and my measurements are about 44\"-33\"-44\" (bust-waist-hip), give or take.I ended up liking these jeans more than I expected to, so I did keep them. I've been on the hunt for a good pair of non-skinny jeans for a while and have tried on so many at this point. I'm 35 so grew up wearing things like low rise boyfriend fit and flare leg jeans in junior high/high school, but then skinny jeans became more the thing around when I graduated, so that's all I've been wearing forever. It feels really weird to wear wider leg pants again (that aren't slacks) but I have to say, it's so much more comfortable... Anyway.These are a little lower rise than I'd like, but having that room in the legs is great. I played soccer for a while and still have the thick thighs and calfs, and these don't hug them pretty much at all. They're nice and loose. The only real complaint I have is that the back pockets are weirdly small, and the legs are a little long on me, but I'm on the shorter side so expect that. The material is softer and stretchy so they're comfy.Overall, I do like these. I don't think I'd purchase again, but I'll wear this pair at least.",

The jeans fit everywhere fine except the waist, It was like a whole another size smaller than the rest of the jeans. And it had absolutely no give or stretch. It has become so difficult to buy jeans online. I brought another brand last month and they fit absolutely perfect in my size, actually they were just a little loose. So I bought the same jean in a different color, when I took it out of the bag and held it up I could see that it was at least two sizes smaller than the the white ones. So it's definitely a game of chance when it comes to ordering jeans.",

If you are hourglass or pear shaped... these jeans check all the boxes....relaxed fit in the hip and thighs and super stretchy. I'm 5'4 and the length is about perfect for me. The funny thing is they are advertised as having a rise of 9.5\" (mid rise), however I knew that couldn't be true because the waistband came up above my belly button. So I measured the rise and it was 12\"! I wasn't mad about it because I love high rise jeans. The only negative I could find about these jeans is they are quite a thin denim material and I question how long they will last, especially after seeing some of the other reviews. But for the low price I paid I'm sure I'll get my money's worth.",

                "reviewText": "According to the Lee size chart, I needed a 14. Their measurements are way different from other size charts; all my other pants are 10s. Anyway, I took a chance on the 14s and they're just what I wanted: a baggier fit, while still fitting well around the waist so I'm not hiking them up. If I wanted a snug fit, size 12 would have been perfect (but none were available). For reference I'm 5'8\", about 155 lbs, 32 inch waist, 44 inch hips. These fit perfectly in the waist and hip area, with relaxed legs that get baggy at the knees after wearing all day. I might do 12s next time for a more form-fitting look in the booty region, but the 14s look great on me. I'm taking one star off for the weird size chart that causes confusion, otherwise I can't wait to get a second pair!!",
