I recently had someone steal an overnight bag from my car including one of my favorite pairs of these jeans. In search of a replacement, I saw Amazon has these discounted generously, even more than the sales when buying direct from the David Bitton site. My first pair I ordered was in my same as always size, and granted they were mostly cotton, but wouldn\u2019t go above mid thigh. They looked to be a size 2, and I\u2019m in a size range of 4-6. I measured them against the same style pair I bought directly from the site and the size is noticeably different (black jeans are from their site and blue are the Amazon pair). Exchanged them and decided to buy a pair with more stretch. These ones fit properly, however, now that I\u2019ve worn them a day, I notice the inside leg seam on one leg is twisted so the pants twist inward. I don\u2019t believe these are genuine or they are just factory seconds being sold cheaply, and while the material quality is good, the inconsistencies are an issue and this should be disclosed.",
