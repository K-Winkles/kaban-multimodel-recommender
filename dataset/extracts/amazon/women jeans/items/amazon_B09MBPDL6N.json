I ordered a size 5 (27 waist), and they fit perfectly - to my surprise. I honestly didn't think that I could wear skinny jeans. These not only feel so comfortable, they fit great. I haven't had to pull or tug on them at all during the day. They are slightly long for my 5'2\" height, but I just folded them up. I think they are perfect for me. So, I will likely wash them and let them air dry. I don't want anything about them to change.",
