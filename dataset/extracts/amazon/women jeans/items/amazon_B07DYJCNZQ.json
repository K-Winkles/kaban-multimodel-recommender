                "reviewText": "I ordered my first pair in about 5 minutes last year ie: zero research. I needed a pair of denim jeans FAST for a 50's costume (rolled up jeans cuffs, big white shirt, cute neck scarf, cat eye glasses, saddle shoes...). I have resisted constricting clothing my whole life because I have chunky legs and am very short waisted. I knew these would be form-fitting but the big white shirt was to cover the lumps. WELL!!! I could not believe how super comfortable these were for all the reasons everyone has mentioned: super stretchy, comfy waistband, stretchy fabric that does not bag. And they are not TIGHT tight like tights. They are just enough tight but stretchy so that bending up and down is a pleasure instead of being something to avoid.And smooth, no lumps at waist or knees or anywhere! SO COMFORTABLE!!!!NOTE ON BLACK ONES: Yes, they are stinky. Research told me that this is due to the processing methods needed to get them black. And, that machine washing them with vinegar would remove the smell. YES IT DID!! And it has not come back...yet, anyway. I have 6 pairs of black ones and they are all now odor-free.NOTE ON SHORT VS REGULAR/LONG: The black jeggings and one other color of blue comes in SHORT length! These fit me perfectly. I ordered regular ones at first and shortened them but they felt baggy-ish in the thigh and knee, but still wearable. The SHORT ones solved this. They fit PERFECTLY! But beware! The legging labels do NOT state \"SHORT\" or \"PETITE\"!! The shipping info does, but not the item itself. And I have experienced ordering SHORT ones but receiving REGULAR ones so you have to check the inseam. The short ones are 2\" shorter and the zipper is 1\" shorter. This was the case when they were on sale for $29. I returned them because they did not send SHORT ones.Bottom line: i got rid of ALL my other jeans, in all size ranges and colors and only own these now. And order another pair now and then in case they stop making them!",

                "reviewText": "Jeans have been hard for me to buy lately because I gained 10 pounds and it seems to have all landed in my gut. My usual size 5 jeans fit everywhere but around my waist. I can wear them but they dig into my stomach and are uncomfortable. Sick of leggings, I went looking for real jeans that would fit around my waist without being baggy everywhere else. These Democracy Ab Solution Jeggings seemed promising because they were advertised as having a stretchy waist.I bought size 6. I am 5'5\", 140 pounds for reference but was 144 pounds when I bought them. I like the weight of the jeans. They feel like lightweight jeans, not jeggings or fake jean leggings. As I pulled them up the first time, I thought to myself that there was no way that they would be comfortable around my waist. When I got there, there was incredible stretch and they buttoned with ease. They fit nicely on my legs, which are thin and long, and around my average size hips. I wore them all day and didn't have an urge to unbutton them or rip them off and toss them away like I had been feeling when wearing my other jeans. They were comfortable and moved with me. They also helped to flatten my belly a little as well.I am happy with the jeans and will buy another shade. I got blue which is more on the lighter side of blue and now want a darker shade for fall and winter. I just wish they were a tad bit longer. They hit at about my ankle which is OK but I prefer jeans that are an inch or two longer than that. With boots and heels though, they look fine. Note that I do have long legs so they should fit fine lengthwise on those with average length legs.",

Stretchy in the right places, elastic waist inside that keeps the mid region in place, and flattens the pouch. They don\u2019t fall, roll or feel tight or uncomfortable. In fact, they are the best jeans I have ever worn. They lift my buttocks, and shape them nicely and the fabric is soft. I forgot that I was wearing jeans!I think that I have personally found my brand.They do run bigger so if you are a 12, go for a 10. Either way, I am incredibly happy I came across this company and their awesome product!Hands down, the best jeans ever!",
