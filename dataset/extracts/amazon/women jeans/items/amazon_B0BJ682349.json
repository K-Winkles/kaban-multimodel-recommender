                "reviewText": "I wanted a quality boyfriend jean with no holes. a pair that I could wear out myself, for the long haul. This denim color is so nice, like a comfort color, medium blue. Nice fit in the butt, the total fit is proportionate, I'm a pretty solid 12 on the bottom, regular 32 length. (sometimes jeans will shrink at the waste, this was perfect, no shrinkage). These you can fold or unfold. They stretch as you wear them so they sag, but the butt still looks good. I love that about a boyfriend jean. So these get a 5 star from me!",

They really are narrow at the bottom of the legs - not the best for rolling up more than maybe a couple times . . . and the legs are so long that to make them work the way I had hoped, I had to roll them up about 4 times - not 2. That made the cuffs look bulky and seriously stupid. They do fit fine and they are cute for regular jeans . . . but they are not at all what I thought. They are just jeans . . . with legs that are too long. So, if I keep them . . . big if . . . I have to alter them to be able to wear them. That's a pain!",
