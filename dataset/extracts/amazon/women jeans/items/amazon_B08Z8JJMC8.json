                "reviewText": "***2022 update: Since I first ordered these jeans I\u2019ve been working out and eating healthy and lost a decent amount of weight. I\u2019m now 5\u20194\u201d 120lbs so I re-ordered these jeans in size 2 and size 0. Size 2 fit perfectly everywhere else but gapped a little in the waist. Size 0 fit tight but stretched out with wearing perfectly. I absolutely love these jeans they are so flattering and comfortable. They hold up really well which is why I came back and repurchased them even after losing weight. I was initially unsure about these jeans but they have proven to be fantastic jeans. Below is my original review from before I lost weight and wore these in a size 6. I will continue to repurchase. They make your waist look so good! Definitely a true high rise jean.**original review**I\u2019m 5\u20194\u201d 135-140lbs and pear shape. I ordered my normal 27 that I normally wear in Levi\u2019s and most jeans. They fit but are a little snug all over, particularly in the legs. They are nice jeans, they just didn\u2019t \u201cwow\u201d me. I prefer my Levi\u2019s. I gave them to my 13 year old daughter who is around 5\u20194\u201d 128lbs (size 26-27 jeans in forever 21 and AE) and she likes them. She has a more straight figure. I would say the rise is on the higher side, they came right to my belly button. They have a decent amount of stretch. If I were to re-order I would go up one size to a 28 but like I said I won\u2019t be re-ordering for myself. My daughter really likes them though and they look adorable on her. That\u2019s the only purpose I would have to re-order these, if my daughter wants another pair. I found them to be really tight on my legs and my daughter doesn\u2019t have as big of legs/butt/thighs as me so they work for her! My daughter is also short waisted and long legged (vs myself having short legs and long torso) so these come up a little higher on the waist for her. She prefers that so she can wear them as high waist jeans with a crop top so she doesn\u2019t show mid drift.(pictures posted are of me wearing the jeans, not my daughter just FYI for reference purpose)**Update: welp I decided to give them another go and ordered myself a size 6! They fit really nice! My daughter kept telling me how much she loves them so I figured I would give them another try. I will say the size 6 is pretty prefect! Updated my rating to 5 star. (Pictures are of me in size 4, which felt to small, particularly in the bum and thighs.)",

They don't have a whole lot of stretch, which I'm really thankful for, because they don't get baggy and saggy by the end of the day. I'm 5' 3\u00be\" & 132#. I wear size 4 in most things (or small if they don't go by # size) and these fit well, plus they are really comfy. They are a tad baggy in the waist, but nothing a belt couldn't handle.",

                "reviewText": "First, I really love the wash and the cut of these jeans, and they're thick, stiffer denim that still has a decent stretch. I hate when I order jeans only to get what is basically leggings made of the thin stretchy fabric that passes for denim a lot of times these days. These are real jeans that should hold up nicely over time to thicker thighs.For reference, I'm 5'3\" 230 lbs, pear shaped, and right now in size 18S in most brands. I had a baby, gained a lot of weight, then lost 120lbs in the past couple of years, so I have extra skin and a belly. 18 is also the size I was pre-pregnancy but I'm still learning what fits my body now. So, I wasn't positive these would fit after reading other reviews and I should have sized up.These fit like a glove in the legs and the butt and they stretch to accentuate your curves in a very flattering way. They're also true high rise, they come up just barely past my belly button, so they checked all the boxes for me except waist size. I feel like these jeans are meant to accentuate a pear shaped figure with a smaller waist. Unfortunately for me due to extra skin from weight loss and having a small apron belly from a c-section, sometimes clothes just don't fit me like they did before and these jeans are a bit too tight. I can button and zip them and they look fine with an oversized hoodie but if I tried to wear them with a fitted top right now it would look like I had two stomachs. I wore them for an entire day thinking maybe they'd loosen up over time but they held their shape all day, which is actually a great indicator of their quality but I just cant wear them right now lol. Comfort is important to me.I also recently bought a pair of Levi's 720 high rise super skinnys in 34S (18S) and they fit perfectly, like so perfect I think I've found my new favorite pair of jeans, but they were more expensive and the material isn't quite as stiff and nice as these Wranglers. These are slim enough in the legs that I think a 20 would still look good so I'm going to reorder but also keep the size 18 for future use. Like other reviews have said, if you're not absolutely sure about what size you need you definitely want to size up.",
