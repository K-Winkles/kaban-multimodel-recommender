                "reviewText": "Update: I\u2019ve now been wearing these jeans for 6 months (I have multiple pairs!) and I bumped up the rating from 4 to 5 stars. I absolutely love them. \u2764\ufe0f I was able to shrink them so they fit better in the waist now. Although my current pairs I own are still in great shape, I\u2019m back to order a few more pairs for the upcoming fall season! I wear them so often. They are my favorite jeans and go with everything. I don\u2019t even wear my high end expensive jeans, I always reach for these Levi\u2019s! They can be dressed up with heels or down with sneakers. They are fantastic for curvy girls and make your body look great! \ud83d\ude0d I 100% recommend!\ud83d\udcab Original review:For reference: I\u2019m 5\u20194.5\u201d tall and 135lbs. I have a pear shape body with short, thick legs, a large bottom, smaller waist and long torso. I ordered these jeans in the color \u201cmascara/dark blue\u201d and in size 2 short. I first ordered them in size 4 short (my normal size in jeans) but the waist was too big and they gapped in the back. I did mark them as running big because for my body shape (smaller waist and bigger bottom half) they ran big. The size 2 short surprisingly fits well. I normally do not wear a size 2! I am always a size 4 or 6 (or size small) depending on the brand. They are extremely stretchy. I almost wish the waist wasn\u2019t so stretchy because when I sit down or bend over I find myself worried about getting plumbers butt. After wearing them for a little bit the waist is ever so slightly large. Overall I love these jeans and they are super comfy and flattering. I just wish the waist was a tiny bit smaller. I think I will have to get them altered. This is nothing new for me. Most jeans I find are a tiny bit big in the waist and gap. In the size 2 it\u2019s really not that bad. I have tried a LOT of jeans that are worse. If you have the same body shape as me I would suggest sizing down a size. The stretch makes them very forgiving. I would classify these jeans as a true mid rise jean. I love that the short length is not too long, it\u2019s perfect! Great for petites. I\u2019m hoping that after I get them altered I won\u2019t have to wear a belt with them because I absolutely hate wearing belts. I may also try to shrink them a little. For the price of these jeans they are great quality. Like I mentioned these jeans fit me much better than a lot of other jeans I\u2019ve tried. I struggle with finding jeans that fit and most of the ones I try are not flattering at all. It\u2019s very rare for me to find a pair of jeans that are actually comfortable and flattering. Some other complaints I read in the reviews are the ankle area is too small, on my pair they are fine. I also read the legs are too big, my legs are very thick so they fit me perfectly. I also ordered these jeans in black and although the size 2 short fit well, they weren\u2019t as soft as the dark blue ones. I kept the back ones, and still have worn them, but I prefer to wear the dark blue ones. My sister has the light blue wash and they aren\u2019t as soft as mine. I\u2019m sticking with the \u201cmascara/dark blue\u201d color and ordering multiple pairs. I am a 31 year old mom of a toddler and these definitely suit my everyday style! I love the dark blue wash because for the most part is has no distressing. The dark blue is slimming and flattering. They can be dressed up with heels, or dressed down with flip flops or sneakers. When I read the reviews for these jeans the sizing was all over the place I think that\u2019s due to some of the washes run slightly different because some have more stretch than others. Also everyone has a different body shape. I was really confused on what size I should order. I saw girls who were my weight/height who were ordering size 8, 10, etc. I actually ordered the size 2 initially for my step daughter who is 5\u20193\u201d and 125-128lbs. The size 2 fit her but was a little big. Then I decided to try them and low and behold they fit me. Lol. I hope this review helps someone out there and if nothing else shows how they fit on the body on someone with a pear shape body. I would recommend ordering with prime and trying different sizes to see what fits if you are unsure. Just something to note these are signature by Levi\u2019s that\u2019s why the label looks different. Someone said they were fake because they didn\u2019t look like their Levi\u2019s with the red tag. Yeah well people need to do their research and see what they are ordering. This is a whole different line from Levi\u2019s. The only other negative thing I have to say is they are a magnet for lint and dog hair. Pretty annoying but it is what it is. Please add more colors Levi\u2019s! There\u2019s only 4 washes in my size and only 2 of them don\u2019t have whiskering!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Jean-Size Lotto: Confusing Information On Two Size Charts",
                "reviewText": "Do not go by the Amazon-page posted size chart or the Levi one in the image array when you place your order. You're going to have to make your best guess between the two as they are both off by a couple of inches (in waist, hip, and length).This confusing issue with two different sizing charts was at the time of my purchase. It is possible this information could change in the future. For now, this is my experience.Assume the numbers the post has listed are short (27), medium (29), and tall (31). These numbers don't accurately reflect the actual length of the jeans. For example, because I was so confused about the sizing information and lost weight in recent months, I ordered two sizes, both the same length. I opted for the 31 as I have a 31-inch inseam, thinking that is what I would get. Now, everyone is physically different. I've known men who were 6 feet tall who have a 31-inch inseam and super short people who somehow have a 33. To clarify, I'm hovering at 5ft4in, weight ~140lbs, with ~30-inch waist with 33-34-inch hips and, as I said, a 31-inch inseam. I have more butt than I do a gut, full thighs (no gap), and an hourglass shape (equal shoulder to hip ratio with a slimmer waste). While others give some details about their proportions to help guide others to a size that might work, they neglect to mention other things like their actual inseam, waist, weight, or body type.I order two colorways (darker wash story-sky and lighter harmony) in two sizes (4 pairs of jeans total) in 10 and 12. I selected the 31 on the Amazon page, thinking I'd get 31-inseam. No. Again, very confusing information regarding inseam ordering. Both the 10 and 12 fit, but I opted to keep the Harmony 12 since these are skin-tight jeans and somehow fit better than the darker wash in the same size.My only real issue is with the length. I received two pairs in 10L 30x32 and two pairs in 12L 31x32. So the 31 on the sale post means 32 long. Why they have them listed: 27, 29, and 31 makes no sense to me. Just assume the 27 means short, the 29 means medium, and the 31 means long regardless of the number. They don't represent the actual length. Again, I requested the 31 and got 32, which doesn't even match what the image sizing Levi provided. Had it, I would have ended up with a 30x34, as 34 is their long measurement.I was only able to keep one pair out of the four I ordered. The lighter of the two shades in the 12Lx32 fit better than the darker wash. I returned the rest and retried ordering using their wacky method.This time I opted for the 29. I got the 30x31 this time around. It is like jeans-lotto. At least I know what my overall size is. Even though it too didn't match either sizing chart. The one on the sales page says 10 = 32.25in waist, and 12 = 31.50in waist, which is obviously a mistake, and on the Levi sizing chart, 10=32.25 and 12=33.5. My 12L was 31Wx32L.I have no clue who to trust or which chart I can go by. So I just went for the next size down (29) and crossed my fingers. Thankfully, they fit.The jeans themselves are like wearing a stretchy corset but for my legs and butt. I look fantastic in these jeans. They are something of a labor to get in and out of if you're not accustomed to wearing skinny jeans. I'm certainly not. I tend to lean to boot cut, but I have some cute sweaters and wanted something with a flat front I could wear them with. There are no buckles, buttons, zippers, belt loops, or even pockets on some of the jeans. Your sweater or shirt will lay flat and not get rubbed by a protruding button or hard edge corner where your jeans meet, assuming you get the jeggings style. These are completely flat and make your tummy appear flatter with the design. The pockets on the front are fake, unless you get the pants with the loops. Some of those have pockets. Ladies are pretty much used to having near non-existing pockets anyway. Which sucks. But for this style of jeans, it makes sense. The two back pockets are generous in size. I have a place for my phone. These are incredibly stretchy and form-fitting. The material feels good, though I'm not sure how it'll hold up after they're washed a few times. I can only hope they keep their shape.",

                "reviewText": "These jeans are amazing. I find it hard to buy jeans that dont give me a muffin top as I dont have a six pack (have a normal, soft mid section). I dont like tight waists that squeeze my middle. I am 5' 3\" and 136 lbs. I bought size 10 Short and they fit amazing. The length is perfect and so is the fit. They are very comfy in the waist - no muffin top. I probably could have gotten an 8 Short too but that might be too tight in the middle section for my liking and I dont like that at all so Im sticking with a 10. Excellent fit from waist to ankles. I ordered 2 more colors. Love them!!!!!!!",
