Not too tight or loose and not too much stretch. Nice and sturdy.I'm going to return them though because they're a little too short. I have long legs [5'8, 171 lbs] and would prefer to wear them with low-heeled boots. If they were fitted at the ankles instead of a straight semi-wide leg they would work. As is, they stick out at the sides and show too much of the shoe. I bought the gray to add a different color to my wardrobe but that didn't work for me either. Nice jeans though.",

                "reviewText": "Plus Size gals, these are for us\u2026really! I wish they had more extended sizing because these are flattering and comfortable. I usually avoid wide leg but am so glad I clicked! These are slimming. They look like my mom\u2019s jeans from the 70s (which she wore through the \u201890s and I can see why)! An actual woman can fit in these things. I\u2019m usually a Size 20. I order up and get a 22 if a brand runs small. I hesitantly ordered Size 18 after reading reviews. They are a bit big through the waist and belly, and my shape is what I call a rounded pear (the round part starts just below my bust). I\u2019m wearing thick waffle weave long johns and could fit 2 more pairs on, so I\u2019m keeping them for October-April in the Upper Midwest US. I\u2019m going to try a 16 (?!?) for the rest of the year. I also want them in black. The light blue color (something River?) isn\u2019t as light as it looks online and I\u2019m grateful! I got them because it was the only color available. I wanted a medium or dark blue and I hope they make them, but these don\u2019t make me look giant. They really have that \u201870s-early \u201880s vintage look. Some people said \u201890s but I don\u2019t see it, but I was in the G-brand. My style (and body) has gone from hard to soft, and I love the coverage, relaxed fit, and feminine styling. I often have to return things because the waist is small, and I have never been so comfortable sitting in jeans. I\u2019m not sure if these are great for apple shapes with slender legs, but for those who carry their weight in the middle and lower as well, these are amazing! I like the slight bell bottom. I only keep one pair of wider bells because they don\u2019t look right with most of my tops. I\u2019m a convert, and I hope to have a closet full of these. Bye, skinny jeans and marmy pants! I\u2019m literally canceling some other orders right now.",

                "reviewText": "I wish this info had been in the displayed comments, alas, if it was I did not see it, so please find this helpful and maybe it will remain in the upper regions of comments for everyone. I am not a poster of pictures at all, but this was all a bit off, so here we go:I bought these in black, two pairs even, and I love them. I love the fabric, the fit, the high waist, the full legs, the pockets, the length, everything. So now to diversify my color options--I buy the same size---just a different color. Nice color, beautiful soft faded blue, just lovely. Eagerly awaited their arrival, etc. Put them on and dang--just too tight to be right. So I measure them up against my fine fitting black pants that have been washed even. The new blue pants, see the picture, almost 2 inches smaller in the waist, ouch! That doesn't work for me. Stuck my hand in the pocket and oddly, not the place I would imagine you would save material, the front pockets are only about 4 inches deep! What's the big idea there? I wouldn't carry cash there, maybe a toothpick? (sideways only) So here's my hands in the pockets, and then the measuring tape for the visual, since I'm doing pictures anyway.These are great pants, and I will try again. I wish there were more colors and the availability was better and the shipping time was faster, but thankfully they are here! Wish me luck!",

I think these jeans are so flattering although I don\u2019t know if I would get them if I had a flat butt, it might emphasize this. The material is thick and seems to be of good quality. I am on the slim side so I like that they seem to give some shape. I love the high waste they are so flattering in my opinion. They will look great with a pointy low heel bootie",
