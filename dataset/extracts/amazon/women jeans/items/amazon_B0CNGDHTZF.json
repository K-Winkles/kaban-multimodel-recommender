                "reviewText": "We had our favorite college pair of high waisted, wide legged jeans in the closet for years, worn occasionally for throw back/costume events and sometimes when we just wanted to see if we still fit in them. When they no longer fit , they moved into the \"maybe they'll fit someday\" closet. Someday never came, so they finally headed off for a chance at a second life.Fast forward and high waist jeans are back on the scene after years of low rise and mid rise. We're still fans of both of those styles and most of our jeans still fit in those categories. We, do however, like to keep one or two trendy outfits as options. So, we saw these and got them.We bought size 6, having lost a few pounds and our regular size 8s need belts. These were a bit roomy in the waist when we first fit them on, so we washed them (hot water) and now they fit perfectly, with no shrinkage in length.They are super comfortable, with a light amount of stretch - just enough to keep one comfortable after a large meal. The front pockets have rivets, the back pockets do not. The coin pocket is a little oddly shaped - kind of long and skinny. Okay for stashing a spare 20 dollar bill, but a bit skinny for coins. The zipper is sturdy one.We have noted some stitching irregularities (skips and some waviness) . We're not entirely happy with the 3/4 inch hem at the bottom of the legs - it gives the jeans an \"I shortened these myself\" look. But maybe that's the intent. The legs are wide. For us, they're a bit wide for bicycle commuting, but fine for bus and walking days.Overall - they're a nice addition to our jean collection. And they're perfect for casual Fridays.",

The only issue I had was that it was short on me and that's probably because I am tall. I am 5'9\" and it was a few fingers short on me. It is made in China and that's why I think it is more on the shorter end. Although the waist is perfect and the material is very good and clean. It has a nice feeling to the material and is very smooth and washes easily. I did give it to my daughter who is a few inches shorter than me and it fits her better. It did remind me of my older times when I was young and the style is beautiful. Very good stitching and design.",

                "reviewText": "The cut of these jeans sent me back to the late 90s and middle school when wide leg jeans were all the rage. Alas those jeans did not have stretch but these ones do and they are so comfortable. The stitching is good quality, the denim is strong, soft, and has a good amount of stretch, and the pockets are actual pockets.The one thing I did not like about these jeans is that they are too long and that seems to be a consistency issue as looking at pictures from other reviewers and reading their reviews, the length seems to not be consistent. Or maybe I just got the one pair of extra longs but luckily for me I have someone who can hem them for me.These are an excellent value for the price they're listed at.",
