                "reviewText": "These jeans have a great weight and feel really well made. They are super comfortable and a great value for $90. I have $200+ jeans that are nowhere near as nice in quality and weight. Amazon told me the best fit for me would be a size 10 but I ended up needing an 8. For reference I'm 5'11\", 160 lbs with a 32 inch inseam. The length on these is generous - I like to roll my pants up to hit at the ankle and these are perfect for that. I bought these in the Doubtless and Easily wash - they are sold on the same page, but they are different denims. The Easily has much more stretch and no so much of a \"boyfriend jean\" fit. Both are fabulous and both are excellent value for money. I did find that the Doubtless wash did stretch a bit through the day, but not too much although I do recommend sizing down for the stretch effect. I'll probably end up buying these in every wash. Save your money on those expensive Mother jeans - these are nicer and you can get more pairs for your money!",

                "reviewText": "Exactly what I like when looking for jeans. Material is not thick and heavy like most jeans. Sometimes when you buy \"stretch\" jeans, by the end of the day they are falling off. These jeans don't stretch out.After reading comments here I decided to size down. I am 135 pounds and I'm 5'5\". I normally wear a size 6 or and 8 (depending on the brand). I ordered a size 4 (what was I thinking...?) and they fit perfectly! Last year I bought KUT jeans at Nordstoms, and paid way more, so this is a great price.After I got my first pair, I ordered a second pair. I'm a happy customer.One thing is when I received them they were in a clear plastic covering, not in a box or envelope. Just mark the item as a \"gift\" to make sure they don't just slap a sticker on it and send it out.",
