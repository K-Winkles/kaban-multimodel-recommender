Jeans, and pants in general, rarely fit me. If they are advertised as tall, they are still usually too short. If I'm lucky enough that the inseam is actually long enough, the waist is too short and the pants pull down all day. These pants are unicorns. They are high enough rise to stay put and not settle into a lower area. They fit snug until the hips where the legs widen. They are long enough that I could wear them with a small heal or platform sneaker. They have a touch of stretch but not so much that they get baggy. They wash well and come out of the wash without the legs becoming twisted and wrinkly. They are surprisingly flattering and well made. Good job, Lee!",

The classic Lee back pocket design and waistband patch remind me of my 1970s & \u201880s childhood. As soon as they arrived, they became part of my weekly wear rotation. So glad I made the impulse decision to buy these retro trousers!",

I've realized in the past few years that jeggings and skinny jeans just aren't it for my build. However, I didn't really know what was. I know baggy jeans are more in these days with the kids, but also didn't want to seem like I was trying to chase a youthful trend as a late-30s mother. These jeans fit perfectly on my waist and hips and then drape really nicely from there. They give my shape the exact balance it was needing. And I love the wide hem! It gives the jeans a slightly more put-together feel, while still working as a casual look. The wash I ordered was not available in a short length, and as someone who is 5'4\" and does not like wearing more than a 2\" heel, I did have to hem these by a few inches. But it was easily done and now I am actually excited about wearing jeans for the first time in YEARS! If you liked the style of Siobhan Roy but live in the real world, you should get these jeans.",

Regarding the length, I don\u2019t wear more than a 1 1/2- 2\u201d boot-heel any more, and even with those, the slacks still touch the floor. They work. No way to hem them without messing with the proportions. I would have preferred the \u201cshort\u201d, but it wasn\u2019t available.The fabric of the \u201celevated retro\u201d color is a nice weight; substantial but soft.

Por mi estatura, es dif\u00edcil (1.52m). Normalmente soy talla 28, ped\u00ed el 8 short y me qued\u00f3 perfecto. Es de cintura alta (a m\u00ed me queda un par de dedos sobre el ombligo), tiene bonita ca\u00edda y disimula muy bien la cadera y el est\u00f3mago.Al sacarlo del empaque se ve\u00eda extremadamente amplio y pens\u00e9 que ser\u00eda un fracaso pero me sorprendi\u00f3 gratamente. Me queda justito de largo para usar con botas de unos 8cm.",
