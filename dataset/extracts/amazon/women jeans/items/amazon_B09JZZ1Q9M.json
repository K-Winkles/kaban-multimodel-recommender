                "reviewText": "This is one of those products that I LOVE, but I didn't want to write a review for in fear that I wouldn't be able to buy them again. Now that I have purchased in all sizes and colors that I like, I am ready to share the love. These jeans are fantastic. They fit true to size with just enough give that potential bloat at certain times of the month doesn't impact them. I am short (5'3), and these are a perfect full-length jeans fit. If I were two or three inches taller, they'd fit more like a crop. They are a boyfriend cut, but they are not baggy because they are also slim. Some jeans that I have bought with the boyfriend cut just make it look as if my jeans are just too big...these do not. They are soft, but they still feel like jeans rather than some stretchy material pretending to be jeans. This means that if you do not wash them before you wear them, prepare for the dye to bleed onto your skin a bit. I don't think it would ruin a shirt touching them, but it would wear blue on your skin. I did not notice any fading or dye transfer when washing as normal. I took these to a large amusement park on vacation and loved every minute of wearing them. They did not bunch or pull or pinch, and my phone fit in all the pockets. After 15 miles they still looked and felt wonderful at the end of a very long day. I loved them so much that I ordered more, and that's just about the best compliment I can give a pair of jeans.",

They have good stretch but don't get baggy as the day goes on. I bought them in size 20 but they were a little big so I sized down. These are perfect I will be buying a lot more colors!!",
