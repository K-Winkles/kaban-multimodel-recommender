I prefer a more fitted look so I\u2019ll have to wash & dry them and hopefully they will shrink as some of these other reviewers have experienced. In regards to the length, I am petite and expected them to drag to the floor but they\u2019re actually a good length, not showing ankles but also not swallowing my shoes. Overall, they are a comfortable pair of pants and are really cute.",

It\u2019s has a very soft material (cotton) and it came with a button replacement just in case, For reference I\u2019m 5.2 -105 pounds.",
