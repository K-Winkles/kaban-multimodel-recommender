                "reviewText": "Bought these in the After Love shade, size 25. Normally I size up in non-stretch Levi's, but these I could have gone with my normal size (24 in most brands). Measurements: 32-24-34, 5'2, somewhere in the 115 ballpark. These have LOTS of extra room in the waist, and the fabric is soft/thin enough that even though it's non-stretch, it GIVES more than I was expecting, even after a run through the dryer.I chopped about 3 inches off the bottom of these because the regular inseam went all the way to the top of my foot (I'm short), I wanted them cropped (so, the raw hem is my DIY fix).They're comfortable, they're cute, they make the booty look good, but there's definitely a waist gap and you can definitely buy your normal size.",

The Ojai Up came with ripped knees not shown in the product photo and I have too many ripped jeans already. The knee holes in the Ojai Up were also weirdly high for me - sitting low on my thigh rather than my knee. Maybe this would work for shorter people (I\u2019m 5\u20199).",
