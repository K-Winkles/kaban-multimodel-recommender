                "reviewText": "These jeans did not have a lot of 'give' to them, which I actually prefer! They fit well and looked very classic, however I did end up returning them because the fit below the knee was weird. I know they are straight leg jeans but they sort of flared out on my frame! I am a size 23 waist and maybe it's because there was just extra fabric on the calf area because I have very thin legs. Overall, I would recommend them and on the average body type they would be perfect!! I purchased these on sale and they were around $20- I did watch them for about a month and during that time the price went up and down a lot, don't pay more than you need to for these! (I don't know if this applies to the other colors I only had my eyes on the black ones)",

I ordered the 32 long as recommended by amazon and after reading reviews, which based off the attached pic of the tag, is actually a size 14. They were WAY too big in my waist. The length however, was good. I am 5'7 and 155lbs for reference (longer legs than torso). I cannot imagine they run that small given these fit me about 2 sizes too big, which seems they were given my normal size and the size listed on this tag. The material was good and i think I would've liked them, if they had fit. I ordered them on sale, and when I returned this size, they did not have an 8long or 10 long for me to try at a reasonable price, but I prob would try if they go on sale again!",
