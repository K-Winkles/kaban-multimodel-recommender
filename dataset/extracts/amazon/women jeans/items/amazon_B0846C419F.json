                "reviewText": "I bought a pair of leggings a few years ago from this company and they are so very soft. I was excited to see that they had joggers. I just purchased a pair of the black ones and they are just as soft as the first ones. I love soft fabric next to my skin. These joggers are great for outdoor casual wear or at home lounging. I usually wear a medium but decided to get a large because I put on a few pounds over the holidays. They fit great in the waist. Loose in the thigh for a baggier look. They are long since I am only 5'1\". I just turn them under at the cuffs. I haven't washed them yet but if they are like my first pair they should do well in a cold wash and delicate dryer cycle. I definitely want more pairs and they are affordable as well.",

I took pictures but it\u2019s hard to see. The zippered ones are a more structured fabric (like a track pant) where as the others are basically a yoga pant material in jogger style. Both are nice but I got these bc I wanted something less clingy on my booty to be able to wear for errands etc. after workouts. The yoga material still was very clingy to the booty. All that being said both were nice and comfortable and decently long. I\u2019m 5\u201d10 with long legs and 170 pounds. Normally I wear a size 8 or medium. I got the large. I also like them overall enough to try some of the other jogger options. If they had more colors in the zipper options or even in that fabric I\u2019d buy several more.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars CAREFUL OF SOLIDS IN STRAIGHT-LEG STYLE (if you're not tiny) THEY'RE AMAZING! (not athleisure wear!)",
                "reviewText": "I found this brand RANDOMLY, because someone was selling these pj pants on a resale site. They looked comfy so I was happy to find them on Amazon for a great price. (I hate spending a ton of money on pj's that I'm only going to wear at home, unless they're \"special sexy pjs\" you know?)I liked the standard straight-leg ones, but I LOVE leopard and they didn't have my size in leopard, so I grabbed the jogger style, never tried joggers before but I took a chance, who cares, they're returnable and I'm wearing them inside my home! I got the leopard joggers and the straight-leg pants in grey camo and burgundy. I tried on the camo as soon as they came and I was IN LOVE. They are SO soft and comfortable.. I don't wake up hot in the night, so they're SO soft, almost feel like a SUPER THIN fleece (but I don't want you to misunderstand, they are NOT what we would usually describe a fleece pj pant.) They're DEF Pj pants, not athleisure wear or anything, THESE ARE FOR AT HOME PEOPLE!! lol. Thrilled with my purchase!!.... so far.....A few days later I tried the joggers on, LOVE! It's a different style for me and a little less \"fleece-y\" feeling but easy to wear for anyone considering trying joggers! I waited a while (assuming I was keeping all these and maybe even buying MORE,) but then I put the burgundy pair on one evening, (same style as the grey camo I bought, if you recall...) They were the same thing, comfy, same material, but OMG THEY WERE HORRIBLY UNFLATTERING!! SO SO UNFLATTERING THAT I WOULD NOT WEAR THEM IN MY HOUSE IN FRONT OF MY FAMILY. It was AWFUL. I don't want to offend anyone, but they really just made things look a lot worse on me! I was so sad, but I recently had a similar experience with leggings, the printed ones looked great but the solids showed every single imperfection. I realized the SOLID COLOR (burgundy vs the grey camo print,) probably because its such a thin soft material, SHOWED EVERY SINGLE LUMP, BUMP, SKIN IMPERFECTION, WHATEVER ...ETC! If you are an xs-s, or you're very very toned and fit, or have no cellulite or dimples or skin imperfections-- you may be completely fine with a solid color! But for many of us that might not be the case, and the prints are 100% a great choice if you fit into that category! (Don't get me wrong, It's not the company's fault I have recently gained weight or that I am not slimmer or more toned.. it's mine! I just want to encourage others to select the best color for them so they are happy with their purchase too and feel comfortable, not discouraged or bad about themselves because of some silly pj pants!!)---> SO A STRONG RECOMMENDATION TO OTHERS BEFORE SELECTING COLORS TO PURCHASE: if you have ANY skin issues you don't want shown, or (ACTUALLY) ACCENTUATED, (think like--back of your thighs? on your bum? cellulite, anything like that..) I WOULD 100% ORDER THE PRINTS! THEY HAVE A TON OF OPTIONS FOR THE PRINTS AND THEY'RE SUPER CUTE (I found it so hard to choose initially!) SO YOU'RE NOT MISSING OUT BY NOT GETTING THE SOLID COLORS! The grey camo isn't unflattering on me AT ALL! I love them! They honestly look great! The joggers are excellent too! The joggers are actually a lot looser on me than the straight legged pants so I'm not sure if the solid joggers would be as much of an issue but I'm not going to take the chance. I bought XL, could have got away with L, but I wanted a really loose fit for sleeping and comfort, (and even still the burgundy showed everything, so they weren't just too tight on me..) I returned the burgundy and am going to grab another print because I love them so much. Might grab a few to go with my nieces and nephews x-mas presents. After washing they seem to hold up fine! It's rare sweatpants or pj pants are long enough on me, not sure why because I'm only 5'6\" but for some reason casual sweat and pj pants (HELLO OLD NAVY?! WHAT THE HECK?) seem to be SO short, which I hate! These ARE NOT SHORT! They're nice and long. I dried them in the dryer too and they didn't shrink up on me in the length. Just NOTE: before they go in the dryer, TIE A KNOT ON THE DRAW STRING ON EACH END OF THE STRING WHILE THE STRING IS IN THE PANTS OR DOUBLE KNOT THEM VERY VERY TIGHTLY! Once they went through the dryer I was searching for the string to pull back through the waist of the pants, I put a knot on each end (like comes standard on many sweats and no more issues with that.All in all they're a great price and a great pant, I think they're my new go to pj pants! Cheaper and better hold-up quality than the pj pants in most of the big box stores...just buy the prints if you're concerned about being self conscious especially with the straight legged style... I promise you'll thank me!!! ;).Sorry for the long review but I hope this gives potential customers as much information as possible to purchase pants you'll be able to enjoy!!!",

                "reviewText": "The material is super soft & buttery, and cozy. Might not be a good idea in high-humidity conditions or very hot weather. I am about 5'3\", and the length is ok because there is a band at the bottom like most joggers. Of course that means there is some bunching above the ankle but that's ok, it's not like I'm tucking these into boots. The black & gray rose print is cute and I like it. I had also ordered a pair in a solid, mid-tone color but returned those because the color wasn't as flattering and it seemed to have some weird dye streaks on them.",
